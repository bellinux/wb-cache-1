In Anglo-American Freemasonry, neither mixed nor all-female lodges are officially recognised, although unofficial relations can be cordial, with premises sometimes shared.|$|E
5|$|The common {{term for}} a place at which one may dive is a dive site. As <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> {{professional}} diving is done where the work needs to be done, and recreational diving is done where conditions are suitable. There are many recorded and publicised recreational dive sites which {{are known for their}} convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions. Diver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the risk is relatively low.|$|E

The paper gives an overview of Croatia’s tax system, including the measures the country already has to combat tax avoidance, and concludes that <b>a</b> <b>general</b> anti-avoidance <b>rule</b> is necessary.

Tadpoles lack eyelids and have cartilaginous skeletons, lateral line systems, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), and vertically flattened tails they use for swimming.|$|E

5|$|Because males emerge {{earlier than}} females, the males compete for mating territories {{surrounding}} the nests {{in which the}} females are located. During a fight, the males risk damaging their wings or appendages by butting and grappling. Another defense technique is to grab another male and carry it high into the air, which {{is thought to be}} a demonstration of strength. As <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> the larger the male the more predominant he is in battles. Age influences the success in the defense and security of territory; the younger the wasp the greater the chance of a successful takeover of territory. Some small males even engage in non-territorial mating tactics, and delay their emergence so as to have a fairer chance of survival.|$|E

What is to be prevented is the seizure of these heights for the purpose of establishing batteries to destroy the navy-yard and arsenal. For this purpose the works should be self-sustaining, or relying only upon such aid as a small movable body of troops can furnish, and upon succor, which may be thrown over the Branch after an attack is developed.|$|E

Allowable costs are those the federal government determines permissible for federal assistance. Unallowable costs are those the government prohibits incurring for federal assistance. Certain cost items are considered universally unallowable, such as cost related to illegal activities and lobbying costs, but others may be considered unallowable for a type of recipient while being allowable for another type of recipient. As <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> any assistance used inappropriately, such as incurring unallowable costs, requires reimbursement to the federal government.|$|E

5|$|There is <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> that a {{landlord}} who leases a property is not liable for nuisances created after the occupier takes {{control of the}} land. There is an exception where the lease is granted for a purpose which constitutes a nuisance, as in Tetley v Chitty, or where the nuisance is caused by their failure to repair the premises, as in Wringe v Cohen. The landlord is also liable were the nuisance existed before the land was let, and he knew or ought to have known about it. Under the principle of vicarious liability, an occupier of land can also be liable {{for the actions of}} their employees; in Matania v National Provincial Bank, it was also established that they could be liable for the activities of independent contractors under certain circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-nine radioisotopes {{have also}} been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 138 to 173. The most stable of these is 154Dy, with a {{half-life}} of approximately 3years, followed by 159Dy with a half-life of 144.4days. The least stable is 138Dy, with a half-life of 200ms. As <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> isotopes that are lighter than the stable isotopes tend to decay primarily by β+ decay, while those that are heavier tend to decay by β− decay. However, 154Dy decays primarily by alpha decay, and 152Dy and 159Dy decay primarily by electron capture. Dysprosium also has at least 11 metastable isomers, ranging in atomic mass from 140 to 165. The most stable of these is 165mDy, which has a half-life of 1.257minutes. 149Dy has two metastable isomers, the second of which, 149m2Dy, has a half-life of 28ns.|$|E
5|$|A new Baroque {{building}} was constructed on {{site of the}} first Castellania by the same Grand Master, creating significant employment as Pinto had hoped for, with works commencing in 1757. Throughout the course of construction, prisoners were held in a torre near Valletta's Porta Reale, probably the tower of Saint James Cavalier. The new Castellania was built to a design by the architect Francesco Zerafa, but he died before its completion, so he was substituted by the architect Giuseppe Bonici. Zerafa is accredited for the main design, and for the subjected building he has post mortem {{established himself as a}} respected architect. The edifice was completed in 1760, with its chapel being consecrated on 15 November of that year. As <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> buildings in Valletta were required to be ready within three-years period from start to completion. The prisoners were transferred to the new prison three days later, on 18 November 1760.|$|E

5|$|A pair of aces {{gives the}} {{blackjack}} player a starting hand value of either a 2 or a soft 12 {{which is a}} problematic starting hand in either case. Splitting aces gives a player two chances to hit 21. Splitting aces is so favorable to the player that most gambling establishments have rules limiting the player's rights to do so. In most casinos the player is only allowed to draw one card on each split ace. As <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> a ten on a split ace (or vice versa) is not considered a natural blackjack and does not get any bonus. Prohibiting resplitting and redoubling is also common. Regardless of the payout for blackjack, the rules for resplitting, the rules for doubling, the rules for multiple card draws and the dealer's cards, one should always split aces.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight {{feathers}} at once, temporarily becoming flightless. As <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from centre outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being more}} powerfully built than other large cats, Smilodon had a weaker bite. Modern big cats have more {{pronounced}} zygomatic arches, while these were smaller in Smilodon, which restricted the thickness and therefore {{power of the}} temporalis muscles and thus reduced Smilodons bite force. Analysis of its narrow jaws indicates that it could produce a bite only a third as strong {{as that of a}} lion. There seems to be <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> that the saber-toothed cats with the largest canines had proportionally weaker bites. Analyses of canine bending strength (the ability of the canine teeth to resist bending forces without breaking) and bite forces indicate that the saber-toothed cats' teeth were stronger relative to the bite force than those of modern big cats. In addition, Smilodons gape could have reached almost 120 degrees, while that of the modern lion reaches 65 degrees. This made the gape wide enough to allow Smilodon to grasp large prey despite the long canines.|$|E
