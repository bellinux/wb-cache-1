5|$|In {{order for}} <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> to occur, fissioning uranium atoms had to emit {{additional}} neutrons {{to keep the}} reaction going. At Columbia University in New York, Enrico Fermi, John Dunning, Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States on 25 January 1939. Subsequent work confirmed that fast neutrons were indeed produced by fission. Szilard obtained permission {{from the head of}} the Physics Department at Columbia, George B. Pegram, to use a laboratory for three months, and persuaded Walter Zinn to become his collaborator. They conducted a simple experiment on the seventh floor of Pupin Hall at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. They discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> might be possible.|$|E

The examined model of the elongation stage takes into account the dependence of reaction?s rate on the absolute temperature, which is described by the Arrhenius equation. This equation can be used in the investigation of the elongation stage of <b>a</b> polymerase <b>chain</b> <b>reaction,</b> since the temperature controls the process. A scheme of the temperature control in the process of <b>a</b> polymerase <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> is examined. Pontryagin?s maximum principle for the optimal control problem is used and the necessary condition for optimality is formulated. The obtained results are required for the numerical calculations of optimal control of the examined stage and help to minimize the required duration of the elongation stage, which will allow to minimize the duration of <b>a</b> polymerase <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> in general. ????????? ????? ??????????? ?????????? ??? ????????? ??????? ?????? ???????????? ??????? ?????? ????????? ? ???????????? ?????? ???????. ? ??????????? ?????? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ????????? ?????????, ??????? ????????? ??????????? ???????? ??????? ?? ?????????? ???????????. ?????? ??????????? ????? ???? ???????????? ??? ???????????? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ?????? ???????, ????????? ??????????? ???????????? ??? ???? ???????? ?????? ???????????. ??????????? ????? ?????????????? ?????????? ??? ?????????? ???????????? ?????? ???????. ???????? ??????? ????????? ?????????? ? ?????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ??????????? ??????? ?????????????. ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??? ?????????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????? ? ??????? ?????????????? ??????????? ????? ??? ?????????? ?????? ?????????, ??? ? ????? ???????? ?????????????? ????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????? ???????...|$|R

5|$|Peierls {{knew the}} {{importance}} {{of the size of the}} critical mass that would allow <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.|$|E
5|$|Starburst {{galaxies are}} {{characterized}} by dusty concentrations of gas {{and the appearance of}} newly formed stars, including massive stars that ionize the surrounding clouds to create H II regions. These massive stars produce supernova explosions, resulting in expanding remnants that interact powerfully with the surrounding gas. These outbursts trigger <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> of star building that spreads throughout the gaseous region. Only when the available gas is nearly consumed or dispersed does the starburst activity end.|$|E

5|$|At {{the cost}} of many casualties, the Third Fort's {{defenders}} delayed the advance of the Germans, but were forced to evacuate and retreat later the same day.

The remaining two forts were captured soon afterwards. After eleven days of fighting, the fortress had been taken.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian {{physicist}} Leó Szilárd, who {{was living}} in the United States at the time, realized that the neutron-driven fission of heavy atoms could be used to create <b>a</b> nuclear <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> that could yield vast amounts of energy for electric power generation or atomic bombs.

Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.|$|E
5|$|In November 1938, Szilard {{moved to}} New York City, taking {{a room at}} the King's Crown Hotel near Columbia University. He {{encountered}} John R. Dunning, who invited him to speak about his research at an afternoon seminar in January 1939. That month, Niels Bohr brought news to New York of the discovery of nuclear fission in Germany by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner, and Otto Frisch. When Szilard found out about it on a visit to Wigner at Princeton University, he immediately realized that uranium might be the element capable of sustaining <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|E

5|$|The December 6, 1941, {{meeting of}} the National Defense Research Committee {{resolved}} to proceed with an all-out effort to produce atomic bombs, a decision given urgency by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor the following day that brought the United States into World War II, and then formal approval by Roosevelt in January 1942. Arthur H. Compton from the University of Chicago was appointed head of research and development. Against Szilard's wishes, Compton concentrated all the groups working on reactors and plutonium at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago. Compton laid out an ambitious plan to achieve <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> by January 1943, start manufacturing plutonium in nuclear reactors by January 1944, and produce an atomic bomb by January 1945.|$|E

5|$|The Mines Inspectorate {{began an}} enquiry, chaired by the mining {{engineer}} William Galloway. The report was published on 15 July. It {{stated that the}} mine was hot {{with high levels of}} coal dust present. The method used to load coal onto underground trucks created quantities of dust, which had aggravated a small explosion and created <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> of related explosions throughout the workings. An inquest held in October concluded that various safety precautions had not been followed, and had the mine been sufficiently watered it would have reduced the coal dust held in the air. The colliery had further problems in October 1910 when a heavy roof fall in the Mafeking return released trapped firedamp, which caused the mine to be temporarily evacuated.|$|E
5|$|Uranium-235 was {{the first}} isotope that {{was found to be}} fissile. Other {{naturally}} occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller nuclei, releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison, absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods (see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control).|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the S-1 Executive Committee on 14 November 1942, Chadwick had {{expressed}} a fear that the alpha particles emitted by plutonium could produce neutrons in light elements present as impurities, which in turn would produce fission in the plutonium and cause a predetonation, <b>a</b> <b>chain</b> <b>reaction</b> before the core was fully assembled. This had been considered by Oppenheimer and Seaborg the month before, and the latter had calculated that neutron emitters like boron had to be restricted to one part in a hundred billion. There was some doubt about whether a chemical process could be developed that could ensure this level of purity, and Chadwick brought the matter to the S-1 Executive Committee's attention for it to be considered further. Four days later, though, Lawrence, Oppenheimer, Compton and McMillan reported to Conant that they had confidence that the exacting purity requirement could be met.|$|E
