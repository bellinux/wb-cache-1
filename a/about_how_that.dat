5|$|Niels Bohr and John Wheeler had {{theorized that}} heavy {{isotopes}} with odd atomic mass numbers were fissile. If so, then plutonium-239 {{was likely to}} be. In May 1941, Emilio Segrè and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California produced 28 μg of plutonium in the 60-inch cyclotron there, {{and found that it}} had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235. At the time only such minute quantities of plutonium-239 had been produced, in cyclotrons, and {{it was not possible to}} produce a sufficiently large quantity that way. Compton discussed with Wigner how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> plutonium might be separated from uranium. His report, submitted in November, stated that a bomb was feasible.|$|E

Following the vote, the bishops and the Pastoral Provision parishes sent a joint petition to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith requesting the establishment of an ordinariate in the United States and making some suggestions <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> could be done.|$|E
500|$|The game itself {{includes}} a filter that players can activate with a password so that violent or sexually explicit content is censored. When the filter is in place, the screen blurs {{during the most}} violent sections, so the player can hear the action but cannot see it. Sierra officials believed {{it was the first}} CD-ROM adventure game that self-censored upon command. Sierra producer Mark Seibert said: [...] "There are some pretty gruesome things, and we're concerned <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> is going to impact parents who want to buy a good game with a good story line." [...] But Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the censoring option was [...] "unlikely to stop any computer-literate 10-year-old" [...] and by scrambling portions of the videos that might be considered offensive, [...] "the censorship option actually makes the explicit scenes seem even worse than they really are".|$|E

2500|$|In Sara Bareilles' album The Blessed Unrest (2013), the 7th {{track is}} titled [...] "Cassiopeia" [...] and is lyrically and metaphorically about the stars. During {{the making of}} The Blessed Unrest, she was given a book about astronomy. She found herself fascinated reading about the {{different}} constellations, especially Cassiopeia, {{as well as the}} topic of supernovas, the incredibly bright bursts of light that stars give off when they explode. Inspired, she penned this song imagining Cassiopeia as a human, and falling in love with another star. [...] "I started to think <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> might feel to personify, you know? The idea of being a star and so far away from everything around you," [...] she told Radio.com [...] "What if a star falls in love? The song is this idea that you give something up to come together." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band also {{revealed}} that within their concept album trilogy, Holy Wood serves as prequel to Mechanical Animals and Antichrist Superstar despite the latter two preceding Holy Wood in release date. Each album contains its own distinct storyline, which can be linked {{together to create a}} larger overarching storyline encompassing all three. Manson has offered this {{much in the way of}} an interpretation: [...] " [...] wanting to fit into a world that didn't want me, and fighting really hard to get there. [...] are idealism and the desire to start a revolution. If you begin with Holy Wood, then Mechanical Animals really talks <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> revolution gets taken away from you and turned into a product, and then Antichrist Superstar is where you're given a choice to decide if you're going to be controlled by the power that you created or if you want to destroy yourself and then start over. It just becomes a cycle." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 1980s the United States {{provided}} {{global leadership}} by {{acting as the}} [...] "Tip of The Spear" [...] among nations in crafting the Convention on the Rights of the Child, or CRC. After the United Nations adopted the CRC in 1989, the United States became a signatory nation in 1994. However, to date the country has refused to ratify the Convention, joining only one other {{nation in the world}} with that status. Among the reasons the United States has failed to ratify the Convention {{is the fact that the}} Convention clearly states that anyone under the age of 18 is a child. The U.S. government has reservations <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> would affect matters when a 16- or 17-year-old commits a crime; currently, in certain instances, such a person can be tried as an adult in the U.S. courts. Several politicians have said that many of the declarations included in the document are not issues for which the federal government is in charge. There is currently no apparent effort within the federal government to adopt the CRC.|$|E

2500|$|Scott Mendelsohn of The Huffington Post {{called the}} film a [...] "bitterly sad and angrily feminist mini-epic", {{and said that}} while it {{presents}} scenes of [...] "matter-of-fact lechery from men towards women that is an accepted norm in our society, both then and now", it [...] "earns kudos for daring to actually be about something relevant and interesting. It is actually very much about the sexualization of women in popular culture, rather than just using those tools to make pointless exploitation fare." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict posited that Sucker Punch uses the [...] "prism of popular culture {{to say something about}} the roles that women find themselves forced into—and not just in the fantasies of geeks and fanboys". Bromley further judged that the film is [...] "about fighting a losing battle. About using every tool at your disposal, be it sexuality or physical strength or wit or the ability to band together to fight a common enemy—the tool of Sisterhood—and <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> still isn't enough." ...|$|E
