It has an Alpha Cygni variable that undergoes periodic non-radial pulsations, which cause its brightness to cycle from magnitude 2.93 to 3.08 over a 24.44-day interval. Omicron1 is an orange K-type supergiant of spectral type K2.5Iab that is an irregular variable star, varying between apparent magnitudes 3.78 and 3.99.

5|$|HD 205739 is a yellow-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type F7V that is around 1.22times as massive and 2.3times as luminous <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> It has a Jupiter-sized planet with an orbital period of 280days that {{was discovered by}} the radial velocity method.

HD 202628 is a sunlike star of spectral type G2V with a debris disk that ranges from 158 to 220 AU distant. Its inner edge is sharply defined, indicating a probable planet orbiting between 86 and 158AU from the star.|$|E
5|$|Iota1 Normae is a {{multiple}} star system.

5|$|Surface {{differential}} rotation is observed on stars such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> when the angular velocity varies with latitude.

5|$|The raven's breast {{is marked}} by Beta Corvi, a star of {{magnitude}} 2.7 located 146 ± 1 light-years from Earth. Roughly 206 million years old and 3.7 ± 1 times as massive <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> it has exhausted its core hydrogen and expanded and cooled to a surface temperature of around 5,100K {{and is now a}} yellow bright giant star of spectral type G5II. It likely spent most of its existence as a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B7V. Bearing the proper name of Minkar and marking the raven's nostril is Epsilon Corvi, located some 318 ± 5 light-years from Earth. It is a red giant of spectral type K2III that is around 54 times the Sun's radius and 930 times its luminosity. Around 4 times as massive <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> it spent much of its life as a main-sequence star of spectral type B5V.

Around 80% as massive <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> it is orbited by a planet 3.6 times the mass of Neptune every 55.8 days. WASP-83 has a planet around as massive as Saturn that orbits it every 5 days. It was discovered by its transit across the star in 2015. A fourth star system has an unconfirmed planet. HD 111031 is a sunlike star of spectral type G5V located 101 ± 2 light-years distant from Earth.|$|E

5|$|Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just {{far enough}} away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> The angular size (or solid angle) of these two bodies match because, {{although}} the Sun's diameter is about 400 times {{as large as the}} Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.

5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E
