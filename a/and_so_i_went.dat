2500|$|Harvey {{was born}} in Windsor, Colorado, the son of Everett and Minnie R. Prewitt Harvey. He grew up in Waverly, Illinois and in Fort Collins and was a {{graduate}} of Fort Collins High School before serving in the U.S. Navy as a Quartermaster, 3rd Class, during World War II, during which time he was studying chemical engineering. [...] "But when I got out," [...] Harvey has said, [...] "I decided that wasn't for me <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> into the theater." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{filled my}} wallet with white stones, [...] I took three foxgloves in my hand, I slung my shoes across my back, [...] <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to fairyland.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to {{the tomb}}, but Antony {{fled to the}} palace. When I came to the tomb I knocked upon the door, and Charmion looked forth from the window.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to my story, which, {{if any one}} dislikes, he has but to {{turn the}} leaf till he finds {{pasturage}} which suits him better.|$|R
50|$|As {{an author}} of poetry for musical setting, Boss has collaborated with Jake Runestad on four choral works: <b>And</b> <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>Go</b> On, Waves, One Flock, and Ave Verum. He also wrote the poetry for the song cycle Panic by Andy Vores, which was first {{performed}} at the Boston Conservatory in 2014.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{now more}} than six years have passed since the night of our parting in the snow, and the end is at hand, for I am really dying. It has pleased God to take my little daughter, and this last shock proved more than <b>I</b> can bear, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to join her and to wait with her till such time as I shall once more see your unforgotten face.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{party in}} 216 {{has been up}} a long time, sir," [...] she asserted. [...] "I found the door ajar at six o'clock, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> in and made up the room." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> into {{a chamber}} apart {{with the old}} wife, Atoua. There, muttering prayers, she poured pure water over my hands into a ewer of gold, and having dipped a fine cloth into oil wiped my brow with it.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went,</b> {{following}} out my purpose. In the Alabaster Hall I found Antony pacing to and fro, tossing {{his hands}} toward heaven, {{and with him}} Eros, for of all his servants Eros alone remained by this fallen man.|$|E
60|$|The waiter {{has just}} come to call us {{to go out and}} hear the echo, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> must <b>go.</b> <b>I</b> will tell you about it afterwards.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cornelia Elliott {{thinks she}} was born to run this world, Mrs. Dr. dear," [...] she had once said to Anne, [...] "and so she is always in a stew over something. I have never thought <b>I</b> was, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> calmly along. Not but what it has {{sometimes}} {{occurred to me that}} things might be run a little better than they are. But it is not for us poor worms to nourish such thoughts. They only make us uncomfortable and do not get us anywhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{knows it}} would need three of us for a serious {{business}} like that. No, I felt lonesome <b>and</b> unhappy, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> out {{to look at the}} sea, and watch the pretty ships go by.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yesterday about two. Of course Wayland couldn't ride, {{he was so}} {{dizzy and}} kind o' confused, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> into camp right there at timber-line. Along about sunset Nash came riding up from this side, and insisted on staying to help me--so I let him." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{leave-taking}} of Monsieur de Lavedan {{was brief}} but cordial; apologetic on my part, intensely sympathetic on his. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> out alone with Castelroux upon {{the road to}} Toulouse, his men being ordered to follow in half an hour's time and to travel at their leisure.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Cantrip's {{grandmother}} was,--I don't {{quite know}} what she was, but something to us. I know I've got {{a picture of her}} at Popplecourt. Lady Cantrip wanted to ask me something about it, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> down. I was so glad to make acquaintance with your sister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I got to Mr. Charlecote,' said Robert--an {{answer that}} thrilled her all over. 'I said I'd be always very good, {{if he would}} take care of me, and not let them frighten me. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> did <b>go</b> to sleep.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "How {{then were}} your eyes opened?" [...] they asked. He replied, [...] "The man they call Jesus made some mud {{and put it}} on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam <b>and</b> wash. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>and</b> washed, and then I could see." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{laughed at}} him. [...] "Were I still eighteen, boy, the thought might trouble me. Had I my illusions, I might imagine {{that my wife}} must be some woman of whom I should be enamoured. As it is, I have grown {{to the age of}} twenty-eight unwed. Marriage becomes desirable. I must think of an heir to all the wealth of Bardelys. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to Languedoc. If the lady be but half the saint that fool Chatellerault has painted her, so much the better for my children; if not, so much the worse. There is the dawn, Mironsac, and it is time we were abed. Let us drive these plaguy gamesters home." ...|$|R
60|$|This I {{dared not}} gainsay, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to my chamber {{with a heart}} full of grief and joy, for these hours that are all of gladness come rarely to lovers, and to me were scantly measured. Perchance it was for my soul's welfare, to win me from {{the ways of the}} world.|$|E
60|$|I was a {{great way}} out of the hurry now, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> on, clear of anybody's inquiry, and brought the bundle of plate, which was very considerable, {{straight}} home, and gave it to my old governess. She told me she would not look into it, but bade me go out again to look for more.|$|E
60|$|But now I made {{a second}} dive, and I went down beautifully. I made a grab {{at the first}} thing my hand touched. It was a purple knob of coral. But it stuck tight to its mother-rock, and I {{was ready to go}} up before it was ready to come loose, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> up without it.|$|E
500|$|.....I {{wanted to}} eat of the fruit of all {{the trees in the}} garden of the world... <b>And</b> <b>so,</b> indeed, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> out, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> lived. My only mistake was that <b>I</b> {{confined}} myself <b>so</b> exclusively to the trees of what seemed to me the sun-lit side of the garden, and shunned the other side for its shadow and its gloom.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dockwrath is an impertinent rascal, and I shall take an {{opportunity}} of telling him <b>so.</b> But as <b>I</b> was saying, I will throw those seventy acres together, and then I will try {{what will be}} the relative effects of guano and the patent blood, But I must have real guano, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>go</b> to Liverpool." ...|$|R
30|$|It {{was just}} that I felt that that’s quite an {{important}} mathematical idea for them to understand <b>and</b> <b>so</b> that’s why <b>I</b> <b>went</b> along that path.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, I met him," [...] said Marner; [...] "but I couldn't stop to {{tell him}} anything, only I said I was going for the doctor, {{and he said the}} doctor was at the Squire's. And I made haste and ran, and there was nobody to be seen at the back o' the house, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> in to where the company was." ...|$|E
60|$|But, after all, {{there were}} few traits {{that could be made}} a note of. I soon grew weary of the scene, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to the railway station, and waited there nearly an hour for the train to take me to Southport. Ormskirk is famous for its gingerbread, which women sell to the railway {{passengers}} at a sixpence for a rouleau of a dozen little cakes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Philip," [...] he said solemnly, when I {{mentioned}} the subject, [...] "there's {{no one to}} blame for this night's work but myself. To do Leonard and that fellow Fothergill justice, they both continually urged me to leave off playing, but I wouldn't. It seemed as though the luck must change at every deal <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> on, and on, and on. What a fool I was!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, {{that was}} what Pilgrim said, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>go</b> round to Mrs. Raynor's. He {{said it would be}} all the better if Mrs. Dempster could be kept out of the house for the present. Do you know if {{anything}} new has happened between Dempster and his wife lately? I was surprised to hear of her being at Paddiford Church this morning.' ...|$|R
5000|$|For Deth Red Sabaoth, Danzig took a {{different}} approach to recording: “I wanted to have an organic sound, bigger <b>and</b> thicker, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> out <b>and</b> bought some 1970s Kustom tuck ’n’ roll bass amps to play some of the guitar parts through. You’ll hear real reverb, real tremolo on this album, which sounds completely different than the stuff that's done with computer chips.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I also; but {{my letters}} {{of this morning}} demand me. If {{it had not been}} for our chase, I should have quitted immediately. The {{minister}} cannot pay the interest on the national debt; not an unprecedented circumstance, and has applied to us. I never permit any business of State to be transacted without my personal interposition; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> up to town immediately.' ...|$|R
6000|$|But [...] "faint heart {{never won}} fair lady;" [...] <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> on, and on, until I had got a Miss Clopper, a {{tolerable}} rich navy-contractor's daughter, {{into such a}} way, that I really don't think she could have refused me. Her brother, Captain Clopper, was in a line regiment, and helped {{me as much as}} ever he could: he swore I was such a brave fellow.|$|E
60|$|When it {{was dark}} I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> and set on the bank {{and listened to the}} current swashing along, and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed; there ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can't stay so, you soon get over it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I felt I was so awkward," [...] she replied, [...] "that I {{made up my}} mind to be {{improved}} in that respect at all events and to learn to dance. I told Ma I was ashamed of myself, and I must be taught to dance. Ma looked at me in that provoking way of hers as if I wasn't in sight, but I was quite determined to be taught to dance, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to Mr. Turveydrop's Academy in Newman Street." ...|$|E
50|$|It {{was only}} when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to this club and heard the sort of things they were playing that I really {{understood}} about 12-inch remixes. Although I myself had already {{had a couple of}} big 12-inch hits, I'd never heard them being played on a big sound system, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> then <b>went</b> back <b>and</b> mixed 'Relax' again and that was the version which sold a couple of million over here the UK.|$|R
6000|$|... 11.--I am now all right. I do {{not expect}} any tic to-night, and shall be at work again to-morrow. I have had a day of open air, only a little {{modified}} by Le Capitaine Fracasse before the dining-room fire. I must write no more, for I am sleepy after two nights, to quote my book, [...] "sinon blanches, du moins grises"; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> to bed and faithfully, hoggishly slumber.--Your faithful ...|$|R
6000|$|O mother, who do {{you think}} I got a letter from, two or three days ago? Aunt Fanny, Ansel's mother--she sent it by a young man, a wounded soldier who has been home to Farmingdale on furlough, and lately returned. She writes a first-rate letter, Quaker all over--I shall answer it. She says Mary and Ansel and all are well. I have {{received}} another letter from Mrs. Price--she has not good health. I am sorry for her from my heart; she is a good, noble woman, no better kind. Mother, I am in the hospitals as usual--I stand it better the last three weeks than ever before--I go among the worst fevers and wounds with impunity. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> among the smallpox, etc., just the same--I feel to <b>go</b> without apprehension, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>go.</b> Nobody else goes; and as the darkey said there at Charleston when the boat run on a flat and the Reb sharpshooters were peppering them, [...] "somebody must jump in de water and shove de boat off." ...|$|R
