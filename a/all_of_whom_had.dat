5|$|Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon's Jedi Padawan, {{who holds}} his master in high regard but {{questions}} his motives at times. McGregor was cast from a shortlist of fifty actors, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> {{to be compared}} to pictures of young Alec Guinness, who portrayed the elderly Obi-Wan, to make a believable younger version. McGregor had a vocal coach to help his voice sound closer to Guinness'. He also studied several of Guinness' performances, from his early work and the Star Wars movies.|$|E
5|$|The film stars Jonathan Haze, Jackie Joseph, Mel Welles, and Dick Miller, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> {{worked for}} Corman on {{previous}} films. Produced {{under the title}} The Passionate People Eater, the film employs an original style of humor, combining black comedy with farce and incorporating Jewish humor and elements of spoof. The Little Shop of Horrors was shot on a budget of $28,000, with interiors being shot in two days utilizing sets {{that had been left}} standing from A Bucket of Blood.|$|E
5|$|The {{firm was}} founded in 1976 by Jerome Kohlberg, Jr., and cousins Henry Kravis and George R.

Since its founding, KKR has completed a number of transactions including the 1989 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, which was the largest buyout in history to that point, as well as the 2007 buyout of TXU, which is currently the largest buyout completed to date. KKR has completed investments in over 160 companies since 1977, completing at least one investment in every year except in 1982 and in 1990.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, 9 September, {{the party}} visited the races, where the prince's horse won the Clumber Stakes. After dinner the prince once again {{wanted to play}} baccarat {{and asked for a}} chalk line to be drawn on the baize, six inches from the edge, behind which players were to keep their counters when not placing their stake. Edward was banker and Williams acted as the croupier. When Gordon-Cumming arrived at the table, there were only two vacant seats. At either of them, Gordon-Cumming would be surrounded by members of the Wilson family, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> been informed of Stanley and Levett's suspicions.|$|E
5|$|The musicians {{included}} Bobby Whitlock, Jim Gordon, Carl Radle, Bobby Keys, Jim Price and Dave Mason, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> recently toured with Delaney & Bonnie. Along with Eric Clapton, {{there were}} also musicians whose link with Harrison went back some years, such as Ringo Starr and Billy Preston, and German bassist Klaus Voormann, formerly of Manfred Mann and a friend since the Beatles' years in Hamburg. Handling much of the keyboard work with Whitlock was Gary Wright, {{who went on to}} collaborate regularly with Harrison throughout the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|While in America he was {{reported}} to have played for a variety of clubs, including Paterson Rangers, IRT Strollers, for whom he appeared on the losing side in the (New York) Metropolitan League Cup, and New York Celtic. He was selected in goal for the New York State Amateur League representative eleven to face the National Association Football League on New Year's Day 1914; his team lost 3–1. In June of that year, he returned to Scotland on the SS California. The liner ran aground off the coast of Ireland with more than a thousand passengers aboard, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> to be transferred to other vessels to complete their crossing.|$|E

It is never explained how he received or could afford his membership of the club, which had a restricted membership of only 200 gentlemen, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> to show £100,000 in cash or gilt-edged securities. Amis, in his study The James Bond Dossier, considers that on M's salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling; Amis points out that in the 1963 book On Her Majesty's Secret Service it is revealed that M's pay as head of the Secret Service is £6,500 a year.|$|E
5|$|Mark Cavendish and Daniele Bennati, stage {{winners in}} the past two editions of the Giro, were absent from this race, but several top sprinters took the start in Amsterdam. These {{included}} Tyler Farrar, André Greipel, and Alessandro Petacchi, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> themselves won Grand Tour stages in 2009 and figured to be top favorites for the Giro's flat stages. Former Tour de France points classification winner Óscar Freire intended to make his Giro debut in this race, but he pulled out due to sinusitis shortly before the race started. Other sprinters in the Giro peloton included Robbie McEwen, Freire's teammate Graeme Brown, Baden Cooke, Leonardo Duque, Sebastian Haedo, Wouter Weylandt, and Greg Henderson.|$|E
5|$|The 1920 APFA {{season was}} the inaugural {{season of the}} American Professional Football Association—renamed the National Football League in 1922. The league was formed on August 20, 1920, by {{independent}} professional American football teams from Ohio, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> previously played in the Ohio League or New York Pro Football League (NYPFL). At the meeting, they first called their new league the American Professional Football Conference. A second organizational meeting was held in Canton on September 17, adding more teams to the league. At the meeting, {{the name of the}} league became the American Professional Football Association. Four other teams also joined the Association during the year. Meanwhile, Jim Thorpe of the Canton Bulldogs was named the APFA's first president but continued to play for the team.|$|E

5|$|The {{camp was}} {{operated}} by 20–25 German and Austrian {{members of the}} SS-Totenkopfverbände and 80–120 Wachmänner ("watchmen") guards who had been trained at a special SS facility in the Trawniki concentration camp near Lublin, Poland; all Wachmänner guards were trained at Trawniki. The guards were mainly ethnic German Volksdeutsche from the east and Ukrainians, with some Russians, Tatars, Moldovans, Latvians, and Central Asians, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> served in the Red Army. They were enlisted by Karl Streibel, {{the commander of the}} Trawniki camp, from the prisoner of war (POW) camps for Soviet soldiers. The degree to which their recruitment was voluntary remains disputed; while conditions in the Soviet POW camps were dreadful, some Soviet POWs collaborated with the Germans even before cold, hunger, and disease began devastating the POW camps in mid-September 1941.|$|E
5|$|Villani and the Buonaccorsi {{had gained}} an unsavory {{reputation}} {{as early as}} 1331, when Villani was tried (and cleared) for barratry {{for his part in}} building the new third circuit of walls around Florence. Charles, Duke of Calabria had granted the Buonaccorsi the right to tax three of the six districts of Florence, which did not help Villani's reputation amongst his fellow citizens. In early June 1342, partners and agents of the Buonaccorsi suddenly fled Florence, Avignon, and Naples, following bankruptcy proceedings by creditors, nearly <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> deposits in the Buonaccorsi bank. Like other Florentine bankers and companies having difficulty with bankruptcy at the time, in September 1342 they supported the move to invite WalterVI of Brienne to become the next signor of Florence. Walter later suspended all legal actions taken against the Buonaccorsi and other company partners for nearly a year.|$|E
5|$|Among the pre-race {{favorites}} was {{the entire}} Spanish contingent of riders. It included two winners of Grand Tours in Alberto Contador and Carlos Sastre, along with highly regarded countrymen Alejandro Valverde, {{winner of the}} 2008 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré and the reigning Spanish national road race champion, and Samuel Sánchez, who had won three stages in the 2007 Vuelta a España. They also had 2008 Tour de France points classification winner and three-time world champion Óscar Freire available {{to work on their}} behalf. Valverde was seen as the strongest threat among the Spaniards. Other medal hopefuls included the defending Olympic champion Paolo Bettini of Italy, Germany's Stefan Schumacher, and Australian Cadel Evans, twice a runner-up in the Tour de France (2007 and 2008). It was thought that members of the overall strong squads from Germany and Luxembourg could also contend for victory. The German team contained Schumacher and many veterans of Grand Tours such as Jens Voigt to work in support, while Luxembourg had the Schleck brothers Andy and Fränk, along with Kim Kirchen, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> worn leader's jerseys during the 2008 Tour de France.|$|E

5|$|By November, {{proponents of}} the peace coin had {{realized}} that congressional approval was not necessary—as the Morgan dollar had been struck for more than 25 years, it was eligible for replacement {{at the discretion of}} the Secretary of the Treasury under an 1890 act. The Morgan design was then being used for large quantities of silver dollars as the Mint struck replacements for the melted coins under the Pittman Act. Though Congress had not yet convened, Baker contacted Fraser in early November to discuss details of the design competition. According to Burdette, Baker's newfound enthusiasm came from the fact that President Harding was about to formally declare an end to the war with Germany—a declaration needed because the US had not ratified the Treaty of Versailles. In addition, the Washington Conference on disarmament, for which the administration had great hopes, was soon to convene. On November 19, Fraser notified competition participants by personal letter, sending official rules and requirements four days later, with submissions due by December 12. Competition participants included Hermon MacNeil, Victor D. Brenner, and Adolph Weinman, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> designed previous U.S. coins.|$|E
5|$|Graham {{was forced}} to {{publicly}} defend his decision, while questions were raised about the knowledge and approval of his decision as the tactical commander {{by a number of}} senior Army officers, including then Commander Australian Forces Vietnam, Major General Tim Vincent, the Chief of General Staff (CGS), Lieutenant General Thomas Daly, and the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, General John Wilton, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> acquiesced to its construction. Meanwhile, as DCGS Graham was second only to Daly in the daily running of the Australian Army. During this time Graham unsuccessfully sought the retention of national service following the eventual Australian withdrawal from Vietnam, arguing that it was necessary to further expand the Regular Army. He later managed the draw-down of Australian forces in Vietnam, and played a leading role in shaping the post-war Army. Graham was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Northern Command in 1973 and later Commander 1st Division. He subsequently filled the position of head of the Australian Defence Staff in London over the period 1974–76. Graham was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 1975 Queen's Birthday Honours. He retired in March 1977.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the Federation of Independents (VdU) {{was founded}} as a {{national}} liberal alternative to the main Austrian partiesthe Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) and the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), successors to the interwar era Marxist and Christian Social parties. The VdU was founded by two liberal Salzburg journalistsformer Nazi Germany prisonerswho wanted to stay clear of the mainstream socialist and Catholic camps and feared that hostility following the hastily devised postwar denazification policy (which did not distinguish between party members and actual war criminals) might stimulate a revival of Nazism. Aiming to become a political home to everyone {{not a member of}} the two main parties, the VdU incorporated an array of political movementsincluding free-market liberals, populists, former Nazis and German nationalists, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> been unable to join either of the two main parties. The VdU won 12% of the vote in the 1949 general election, but saw its support beginning to decline soon afterward. It evolved into the FPÖ by 1955/56 after merging with the minor Freedom Party in 1955; a new party was formed on 17 October 1955, and its founding congress was held on 7 April 1956.|$|E

5|$|In May 1920 Princess Matoika took {{on board}} the bodies of ten female nurses and over 400soldiers who died while on duty in France during the war. The ship then transited the Kiel Canal and picked up 1,600U.S. {{residents}} of Polish descent at Danzig, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> enlisted in the Polish Army {{at the outset of}} the war. Also included among the passengers were 500U.S. soldiers who had been released from occupation duty at Koblenz. The ship arrived at New York on 23May with little fanfare and no ceremony; bodies returned but not claimed by families were buried at Arlington National Cemetery. On 21 July, Princess Matoika arrived in New York after a similar voyage with 25war brides, many repatriated Polish troops among its 2,094 steerage passengers, and the remains of 881soldiers. In between these two trips, the Belgian Ambassador to the United States, Baron Emile de Cartier de Marchienne, sailed from New York to Belgium {{on board the}} Matoika. It was, however, Princess Matoikas next trip to Belgium that was the most infamous.|$|E
5|$|Nicholas Gleaves as Dr. James Whitaker. Whitaker {{serves as}} the main {{antagonist}} of the second series. He is a biochemist leading the research into a cure for the virus {{from the safety of}} a biologically secure research and development facility. As the research begins to require increasingly unethical practices, he lies and rationalises in the struggle to maintain the loyalty of his colleagues. Unbeknownst to the other workers (<b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> lost loved ones in the pandemic), he had secreted his wife (portrayed by Alisa Arnah) and young son within the facility, violating protocol. His true motives are suspect, as he answers to someone called Mr. Landry, with whom he communicates over a satellite video link. Until his death he was using stolen anti-virus produced from Abby's blood for himself, keeping it from the others, who died when the virus got into the lab after Abby infected his wife. At {{the end of the second}} series, he is accidentally shot and killed by a sniper in Landry's employ.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the crewmen, soldiers, sailors and gunners alike, nothing has been recorded. The only source of information for these men has been through osteological analysis of the human bones found at the wrecksite. An approximate composition of some of the crew has been conjectured based on contemporary records. The Mary Rose would have carried a captain, a master responsible for navigation, and deck crew. There would also have been a purser responsible for handling payments, a boatswain, the captain's second in command, at least one carpenter, a pilot in charge of navigation, and a cook, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> one or more assistants (mates). The ship was also staffed by a barber-surgeon who tended to the sick and wounded, along with an apprentice or mate and possibly also a junior surgeon. The only positively identified person who went down with the ship was Vice-Admiral George Carew. McKee, Stirland and several other authors have also named Roger Grenville, father of Richard Grenville of the Elizabethan-era Revenge, captain during the final battle, although the accuracy of the sourcing for this has been disputed by maritime archaeologist Peter Marsden.|$|E
