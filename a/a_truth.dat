5|$|In {{computational}} complexity theory, 2-satisfiability {{provides an}} example of an NL-complete problem, one that can be solved non-deterministically using a logarithmic amount of storage and that is among the hardest of the problems solvable in this resource bound. The set of all solutions to a 2-satisfiability instance can be given the structure of a median graph, but counting these solutions is #P-complete and therefore not expected to have a polynomial-time solution. Random instances undergo a sharp phase transition from solvable to unsolvable instances as the ratio of constraints to variables increases past 1, a phenomenon conjectured but unproven for more complicated forms of the satisfiability problem. A computationally difficult variation of 2-satisfiability, finding <b>a</b> <b>truth</b> assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied constraints, has an approximation algorithm whose optimality depends on the unique games conjecture, and another difficult variation, finding a satisfying assignment minimizing the number of true variables, is an important test case for parameterized complexity.|$|E
5|$|The 2-satisfiability {{problem is}} to find <b>a</b> <b>truth</b> {{assignment}} to these variables that makes the whole formula true. Such an assignment chooses whether to make each of the variables true or false, so {{that at least one}} literal to true in every clause becomes true. For the expression shown above, one possible satisfying assignment is the one that sets all seven of the variables to true. Every clause has at least one non-negated variable, so this assignment satisfies every clause. There are also 15 other ways of setting all the variables so that the formula becomes true. Therefore, the 2-satisfiability instance represented by this expression is satisfiable.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempts}} to gain {{entry to the}} manor continue as the LEP recruit an infamous criminal, the kleptomaniac dwarf Mulch Diggums to break in. Fairies are forbidden from entering human dwellings without permission, but Mulch has forfeited the magic preventing him from entering dwellings, causing him to be safe when burglarizing. He tunnels underground to reach the house while Foaly feeds a loop to the manor surveillance system, allowing Mulch to freely explore. Mulch accidentally locates a safe containing Artemis' copy of the Book, finally revealing to the fairies the source of Artemis' knowledge, which he had led them to believe he had acquired from <b>a</b> <b>truth</b> serum administered to Holly. The Fairy Council, deciding that nothing is working, promotes a lieutenant called Briar Cudgeon to Acting Commander, temporarily usurping Julius Root. Meanwhile, Holly Short cracks through the concrete of her cell, finding fresh dirt, and completes the ritual with a smuggled acorn. Having regained her magic, she escapes into the main house.|$|E
50|$|Truth {{functions}} are functions from sequences of truth values to <b>truth</b> values. <b>A</b> unary <b>truth</b> function, for example, takes <b>a</b> single <b>truth</b> value and maps it onto another <b>truth</b> value. Similarly, <b>a</b> binary <b>truth</b> function maps ordered pairs of truth values onto <b>truth</b> values, while <b>a</b> ternary <b>truth</b> function maps ordered triples of truth values onto truth values, and so on.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the most}} common {{interpretation}} of modal logic, one considers [...] "logically possible worlds".

5|$|The {{compensation}} package {{led to the}} Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA), {{announced on}} May 8, 2006, and implemented in September 2007. At the time, there were about 86,000 living victims. The IRSSA included funding for the AHF, for commemoration, for health support, and for <b>a</b> <b>Truth</b> and Reconciliation program, {{as well as an}} individual Common Experience Payment (CEP). Any person who could be verified as having resided at a federally run Indian residential school in Canada was entitled to a CEP. The amount of compensation was {{based on the number of}} years a particular former student resided at the residential schools: $10,000 for the first year attended (from one night residing there to a full school year) plus $3,000 for every year thereafter.|$|E
5|$|After {{watching}} an advertisement on television for Duff Gardens, Homer, Bart and Lisa decide to go. As they prepare to leave, Marge tells them that spinster Great Aunt Gladys died {{and they will}} be going to her funeral instead. The Simpsons, along with Patty and Selma, drive to Littleneck Falls to attend her funeral and the reading of her will. On the video will, Great Aunt Gladys tells Patty and Selma not to die alone, as she did. Selma hears the ticking of her biological clock, and decides she wants a child. Selma tries video dating, but gets rejected by Groundskeeper Willie. She goes to a psychic who tries to sell her a love potion. The psychic ingests it, blurts out the innocuous ingredients and discovers that she accidentally drank <b>a</b> <b>truth</b> serum. Selma dates Hans Moleman after revoking his license at the DMV. All goes well until Hans tries to kiss her goodnight; Selma envisions herself as the mother of several ugly, blind children and kicks Hans out of the car to prevent that future from happening. Lisa then suggests to Selma that she go through artificial insemination.|$|E
25|$|Usually in truth-functional propositional logic, {{formulas}} {{are interpreted}} as having either <b>a</b> <b>truth</b> value of true or <b>a</b> <b>truth</b> value of false. Truth-functional propositional logic and systems isomorphic to it, {{are considered to}} be zeroth-order logic.|$|E

2500|$|<b>A</b> logical <b>truth</b> (also called <b>an</b> {{analytic}} <b>truth</b> or <b>a</b> necessary <b>truth)</b> is <b>a</b> statement {{which is}} true in all possible worlds or under all possible interpretations, as contrasted to a fact (also called a synthetic claim or a contingency) which is only true in this world as it has historically unfolded.

50|$|The form of {{argument}} can be shown {{by the use of}} symbols.

A statement form is <b>a</b> logical <b>truth</b> if it is true under all interpretations.

25|$|One of {{the widely}} studied {{principles}} of Charvaka philosophy was its rejection of inference {{as a means}} to establish valid, universal knowledge, and metaphysical truths.

50|$|Argument {{by analogy}} may {{be thought of}} as {{argument}} from the particular to particular.

Plato was mortal, and B. Socrates was like Plato in other respects, then asserting that C. Socrates was mortal is an example of argument by analogy because the reasoning employed in it proceeds from <b>a</b> particular <b>truth</b> in <b>a</b> premise (Plato was mortal) to <b>a</b> similar particular <b>truth</b> in the conclusion, namely that Socrates was mortal.|$|R
30|$|Another {{approach}} to evaluate {{improvements in the}} quality of the detected communities is to compare them with existing network ground truths [6]. According to Yang and Leskovec [54], <b>a</b> ground <b>truth</b> is built upon particular features of the application domain (e.g., department affiliation), which makes it possible to divide its entities into specific groups. However, obtaining <b>a</b> ground <b>truth</b> to evaluate the quality of community detection algorithms is not an easy task, because it is necessary to have data that describes the natural topology of the communities in order to make sense to compare them with the results provided by such algorithms. Furthermore, there is not a consensus whether the evaluation with <b>a</b> ground <b>truth</b> is adequate for real datasets or only for synthetic ones, exactly because of the difficulty to build <b>a</b> ground <b>truth</b> for those datasets. Thus, we were able to build <b>a</b> ground <b>truth</b> only for the APS dataset, since it was possible to explicitly assign a specific research area to each journal. Notice that DBLP and PubMed do not provide any explicit information on the research area of their publication venues. For the other datasets, we did not find a way to build <b>a</b> ground <b>truth</b> that could be compared with the results of the algorithms.|$|R
25|$|Theologians {{give the}} name mystery to {{revealed}} truths that surpass {{the powers of}} natural reason, so, in a narrow sense, the Mystery is <b>a</b> <b>truth</b> that transcends the created intellect.
