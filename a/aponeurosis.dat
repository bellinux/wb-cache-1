5|$|Normally the plantar fascia {{has three}} {{fascicle}}s {{with the central}} fascicle thickest at 4mm, the lateral fascicle at 2mm and the medial at less than a millimeter in thickness. In theory, the likeliness of fasciitis increases with increasing thickness of plantar fascia at the calcaneal insertion, with thickness of more than 4.5mm being somewhat useful on ultrasound and 4mm on MRI. Findings on imaging such as plantar <b>aponeurosis</b> thickening, however, may be absent in symptomatic individuals or present in asymptomatic individuals thereby limiting the utility of such observations.|$|E
25|$|Fascicle ends {{nearest the}} deep MG <b>aponeurosis</b> (Achilles tendon) showed an {{increase}} in strain from the proximal to distal portions of the MG muscle. The converse {{was seen in the}} fascicle ends adjacent to the superficial <b>aponeurosis,</b> which decreased in fiber strain from proximal to distal portions of the MG muscle. These trends may have been due to changes in CSA of the muscle at the proximal and distal ends of the MG, resulting in regions of high stress and strain concentration.|$|E

40|$|Muscle {{thickness}} measurement in ultrasonography was traditionally {{conducted by}} a trained operator, and the manual detecting process is time consuming and subjective. In this paper, we proposed an automatic tracking strategy to achieve the continuous and quantitative measurement for gastrocnemius muscle thickness in ultrasound images. The method involved three steps: tracking of seed points, contours extraction of <b>aponeuroses,</b> and muscle thickness estimation. In an ultrasound image sequence, we first selected two seed {{points in the first}} frame manually for the superficial and deep <b>aponeuroses,</b> respectively. Seed points in all following frames were then tracked by registering to their respective previous frames. Second, we adopted the local and global intensity fitting model to extract the contours of <b>aponeuroses.</b> At last, the muscle thickness was achieved by calculating the distance between the contours of superficial and deep <b>aponeuroses.</b> The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using 500 frames of ultrasound images. It was demonstrated in the experiments that the proposed methods could be used for objective tracking of <b>aponeuroses</b> and estimation of muscle thickness in musculoskeletal ultrasound images.

40|$|Normal tendons and palmar <b>aponeuroses</b> from {{patients}} with {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} and tissues of the palmar <b>aponeuroses</b> {{from patients}} with Dupuytren's contracture were subjected to biomechanical tests. Several parameters characterizing the viscoelastic load response of the tissues were investigated. The tissues from patients with Dupuytren's contracture were classified according to their macroscopic and histological appearance into apparently normal palmar <b>aponeuroses,</b> thickened fibre bundles and contracture bands. There were biomechanical differences between the normal palmar <b>aponeuroses</b> and the apparently normal palmar <b>aponeuroses</b> indicating that biomechanical changes occur before thickening of fibres or cellular proliferation can be observed. Significant biomechanical changes occurred between apparently normal palmar <b>aponeuroses</b> and thickened fibre bundles. Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volume, 1997) 22 B: 4 : 510 517 The biomechanical properties of tendons and skin are well known and display the following features. The load-strain curve is usually divided into three portions, (1) the "toe-region " characterized by an increasing stiffness (slope of the load strain relationship), (2) the linear load-strain region and (3) the failure region with decreasing stiffness followed by rupture (Fung, 1981). At low strain levels the collagen fibres are not straight but wavy (KasteIic et al. 1980; Viidik, 1979). As observed {{in the study of}} Millesi (1965), this wavy arrangement may be explained by the interaction of the collagen fibres with the elastin, if a tissue with a parallel arrangement of collagen fibres is strained to more than 3 % the wavy arrangement of the collagen fibres is straightened (Viidik, 1979). This part of the stress-strain curve corresponds to the toe region. Within the linear region of the load-strain relation-ship, the collagen fibres themselves are elongated (Mosler et al, 1985; Viidik, 1979). Connective tissues display viscoelastic behaviour within both the "toe-region " and the linear region (Cohen et al, 1978...|$|R

25|$|The plantar muscles can be {{subdivided}} {{into three groups}} associated with three regions: those of the big digit, the little digit, and the region between these two. All these muscles are covered by the thick and dense plantar <b>aponeurosis,</b> which, together with two tough septa, form the spaces of the three groups. These muscles and their fatty tissue function as cushions that transmit {{the weight of the}} body downward. As a whole, the foot is a functional entity.|$|E
25|$|The muscle {{architecture}} of pennate muscles, {{such as the}} human quadriceps, is highly plastic and strongly influences contractile properties. Changes to pennate muscle architectural properties, such as pennation angle and thereby the PCSA, can alter the muscle’s force producing capabilities {{as well as the}} AGR at which the muscle operates. Parallelogram models predict that total PCSA of bipennate muscles increases in proportion to sin(θpennation) while total force exerted on the associated <b>aponeurosis</b> decreases with cos(θpennation). This theorizes that pennate muscle force generation increases until a 45 degree pennation angle is achieved.|$|E
25|$|The iliohypogastric (T12-L1) and ilioinguinal nerves (L1) {{emerge from}} the psoas major near the muscle's origin, from where they run {{laterally}} downward to pass anteriorly above the iliac crest between the transversus abdominis and abdominal internal oblique, and then run above the inguinal ligament. Both nerves give off muscular branches to both these muscles. Iliohypogastric supplies sensory branches to {{the skin of the}} lateral hip region, and its terminal branch finally pierces the <b>aponeurosis</b> of the abdominal external oblique above the inguinal ring to supply sensory branches to the skin there. Ilioinguinalis exits through the inguinal ring and supplies sensory branches to the skin above the pubic symphysis and the lateral portion of the scrotum.|$|E

25|$|A 2007 study, {{conducted}} by Blazevich et al., reiterated and added an extra dimension to Aagaard et al.’s conclusions. Blazevich et al. examined {{the effect of}} 10-week concentric or eccentric knee extension training on architectural properties of the human quadriceps {{with the purpose of}} uncovering the mechanical stimulus involved in architecture adaptation. Both modes of exercise resulted in increased peak concentric and eccentric strength. Concentric training, however, results in higher peak concentric strength. Ultrasonography suggests vastus medialus and vastus lateris muscle fiber length increase similarly following eccentric and concentric training, with the changes occurring abruptly over the first 5 weeks of the training program. Because fiber length was independent of training type, Blazevich et al. believe distance of operation determines the optimal fiber length. This muscle property is important in determining the angle-torque relationship of a muscle. The study supported the pennation angle trends uncovered by Aagaard et al.; in addition, Blazevich et al. concluded that the vastus lateris fascicle angle changes are independent of training type and modulates strongly with volume. This suggests fiber length and pennation angle modifications occur via separate mechanical stimuli, i.e. distance of operation and muscle volume respectively. Furthermore, these angle changes occur over a relatively long time scale as the pennation angle increased until the cessation of the training program at week 10. Blazevich et al. predict the increase in pennation angle seen after eccentric or concentric training allow the pennate muscle to attach more fibers to the associated <b>aponeurosis</b> as well as increase PCSA and AGR. Architectural modifications to pennate muscles shift the position at which the muscle operates on the force-velocity and force-length curves to regions best suited for the muscle’s function. An increase in pennation angle theoretically increases both the PCSA and AGR of a given pennate muscle, allowing the muscle to generate higher forces while operating at higher optimal speeds. An increase to fiber length would allow the muscle to function at longer lengths.|$|E
500|$|Gophers are {{burrowing}} rodents of {{the family}} Geomyidae, characterized by fur-lined, external cheek pouches used to gather and transport food. The cheek pouches of geomyids such as the camas pocket gopher are controlled {{by a set of}} muscles, with a sphincter controlling the opening and closing of the pouch.
