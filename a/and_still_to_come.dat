40|$|This article aims to {{show that}} the Old Testament concept of the year of jubilee is neither an anachronistic, nor a {{peripheral}} de- tail of Scripture. It {{is an integral part of}} it and indeed one her- meneutical tool for interpreting and applying it to social and mo- ral transformation in South Africa.   Israel, liberated from slavery and returning to God, became a paradigm for the liberated slave to return to his inheritance in the year of jubilee celebrated every 50 th year. Its underlying concerns are: justice, freedom, human dignity and rights.   Jesus clearly understood his mission in terms of the proclama- tion of “the year of the Lord’s favour” (Luke 4 : 14 - 21), and de- monstrated this by preaching good news to the poor, freeing the prisoners, restoring sight to the blind, and releasing the op- pressed. He linked the mission of his followers with his own and with the promise and gift of the Holy Spirit. Pentecost, seen as fulfilment and announcement of God’s promise, demonstrates that the kingdom of God is already here <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>   The Book of Revelation gathers together this scriptural theme and presents the jubilee as good news for now and the future. Indeed, God’s future is presented as the ultimate jubilee. Although these institutions cannot be imposed on a secular democracy, there are implications here for holistic evangelism and mission as well as for social and moral transformation in South Africa.   These implications, it is argued, should include a reference to the ‘missio Dei’ as Jesus expressed it: holistic evangelism; a commitment to the values and practices of restorative justice; restoration, healing and hope; economic justice and land re- form; ecological responsibility; and moral restoration...|$|E
40|$|For the Internet of Things {{to become}} a reality needs a set of {{technologies}} to support the communication of and object. For short range communication this is solved, but for large range several candidates are possible. The usage of mobile networks has been as the only solution {{until two years ago}} that the so called LPWA solutions appeared. Among the different solutions proposed, in addition to Sigfox, already in use, LoRa appears as a good solution that needs to be studied in more detail. The aim {{of this study is to}} shed light on the new LoRaTM protocol, one of the many technologies that is presented as the definitive solution to cover the increasing needs of the Low Power Wide Area Networks created to extend the Internet of Things everywhere and to everybody. The next document describes the main characteristics of this new technology, explaining the PHY layer LoRaTM as well as the MAC layer LoRaWANTM. Even so, its characteristics and many of its applications are very broad and many of them are still under development <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> that’s why it has been impossible to explain all its functions, for example the use of LoRaTM for the geolocation. For this propose, we have divided the document on two main parts, on the first one, we explain LoRaTM protocol main features and some of their limitations due to the Duty Cycle regulation on the ISM band or due to the use of Aloha as Medium Acces Control. On the second part, we focus on the LoRaTM performance on real scenarios to check some of its principal features. Check the differences between Spreading Factors on long distances, compare the performance of the Cyclic Redundancy Checks against the Spreading Factor or evaluate how the free-licensed ISM band can affect the efficiency of the transmissions. El propósito de este proyecto era estudiar el nuevo protocolo LoRa, una de las nuevas tecnologías creada y presentada como una de las soluciones definitivas para cubrir la existente necesidad de las redes LPWAN. El siguiente documento describe las características claves de esta nueva tecnología, explicando sus dos capas principales: la capa física LoRa y la capa MAC, llamada LoRaWAN. Seguidamente nos hemos centrado en el estudio de su comportamiento en escenarios reales y hemos estudiado algunas de las limitaciones de este protocolo.

30|$|Oral {{histories}} {{say that}} the Hupa, Yurok, and Karuk {{have lived in the}} area of northwestern California since the beginning of time. These three California Indian tribes are often described as sharing a “common culture” as they have <b>and</b> <b>still</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>come</b> together in ceremony and for other community activities. For Western linguists, anthropologists, archaeologists, and other academics who have studied and theorized about Native peoples, the Hupa, Yurok, and Karuk have parallel cultures that are relatively the same. But they also present a sort of paradox when it <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> theorizing about the development of these cultural practices. As {{one of the most popular}} linguistic theories, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is rooted in “cultural relativism” and was based on the idea that “one’s entire sense of reality shifts as one passes from one community to the next…” (O’Neill 2008). Language was “said to encapsulate worldview and reflect its cultural subject matter”. However, the Hupa, Yurok, and Karuk share cultural similarities even though they have three very different languages (O’Neill 2008).|$|R

She broke out in this strain to her host almost as soon as she had crossed the threshold, commending his circumstances, his conditions of work, as infinitely happier than her own. He was quiet, independent, absolute, free to do what he liked as he liked it, shut up in his little temple with his altar and his divinity; not hustled about in a mob of people, having to posture and grin to pit and gallery, to square himself at every step with insufferable conventions and with the ignorance and vanity of others.

40|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the TRC, Desmond Tutu stated that the Commission’s task was to promote, not to achieve, reconci- liation. Reconciliation, he maintained, is the responsibility of all South Africans, and expressed the hope that the Christian churches would be in the forefront of this healing process.   This article explores how the Christian church can be in the forefront of binding up the wounds, facilitating the healing pro- cess, and living as a people and a sign of hope. The answers it seeks to offer fall under three interrelated themes, namely the church’s:   • spirituality of reconciliation; • ministry and mission of reconciliation; and • resources for its ministry and mission of reconciliation.   Cultivating a spirituality of reconciliation would mean making reconciliation a lifestyle, rather than a series of strategies, pro- grammes or initiatives, yet remaining concrete, practical, mea- surable and accountable.   The church’s mission is primarily to proclaim the good news of God’s Kingdom that is already here, but not yet fully here <b>and</b> therefore <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> This proclamation is the message of reconciliation between God, others and the self, and anticipates the unity of all creation in Jesus Christ.   The resources given to the church to fulfil this apostolic ministry include prophecy, evangelism, pastoral care and teaching, as well as its liturgical and sacramental life, its ministry of pre- sence, its people and its commitment to social justice...|$|R

A dense growth of leather-like leaves, above which rise in majestic isolation the solitary flowers, encircles the outer rampart, shutting the castle in as it might be the palace of the Sleeping Beauty.

Antithrombin III is an important inhibitor of the intrinsic, extrinsic and common pathway of coagulation.
