5|$|According to the {{economic}} theory behind congestion pricing, {{the objective of this}} policy is the use of the price mechanism to make users more aware of the costs that they impose upon one <b>another</b> <b>when</b> consuming during the peak demand, and that they should pay for the additional congestion they create, thus encouraging the redistribution of the demand in space or in time, or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good; for example, switching from private transport to public transport.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana's realm {{began with the}} capture of his brother Andrianavalonimerina's territory, which he ruled from Ambohitrabiby. The king led his brother {{to believe that they}} were on friendly terms and that they should work together to support one <b>another.</b> <b>When</b> the king launched a surprise attack on Ambohitrabiby, his brother was unprepared to deflect the offensive and Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana successfully seized control of the territory, which he incorporated into his own.|$|E
5|$|Aphids {{and other}} hemipteran insects secrete a sweet liquid called {{honeydew}}, when they feed on plant sap. The sugars in honeydew are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect. In some cases, the aphids secrete the honeydew {{in response to}} ants tapping them with their antennae. The ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to <b>another.</b> <b>When</b> migrating to a new area, many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew. Ants also tend mealybugs to harvest their honeydew. Mealybugs may become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect mealybugs from their natural enemies.|$|E

5|$|In an {{alternate}} story line, Nemo admits to Anna he cannot swim; the two spend time together {{and fall in}} love. Anna {{turns out to be}} Harry's daughter and the two step siblings begin an illicit affair. They pledge their lives to one <b>another.</b> <b>When</b> Harry and Nemo's mother break up, Anna goes to New York with her father, and they lose touch. Years later, Nemo works as a pool cleaner, hoping to run into Anna by chance. They finally see one another at the train station and immediately recognize each other in a crowd of passers-by. After a passionate reunion, Anna announces she is not ready to immediately resume the relationship. She gives him her number, asks him to call her in two days and meet at the lighthouse. However, he loses her number when a sudden downpour makes her note illegible. Nemo waits at the lighthouse every day, but Anna does not come.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that within the data used to develop the DSM system there is a large {{literature}} leading to the conclusion that a spectrum classification provides a better perspective on phenomenology (appearance and experience) of psychopathology (mental difficulties) than a categorical classification system.

The inevitable first question that Somalis asked one <b>another</b> <b>when</b> they met was, 'What is your clan?'. When this was considered anathema {{to the purpose of}} a modern state, Somalis began to pointedly ask, 'What is your ex-clan?'. Barre outlawed this question and a broad range of other activities classified as clanism. Informers reported qabilists to the government, leading to arrests and imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|Galvanic {{corrosion}} is an electrochemical {{process whereby}} one metal corrodes preferentially to <b>another</b> <b>when</b> both metals are in electrical contact {{with each other}} in the presence of an electrolyte, such as moisture and salts. This is because the dissimilar metals have different electrode potentials. The potential difference between the dissimilar metals is the driving force for the accelerated attack on the metal with the lower galvanic number (i.e., the anode). Over time, the anode metal dissolves into the electrolyte.|$|E

25|$|A {{bifold door}} is {{a unit that}} has several sections, folding in pairs. Wood {{is the most common}} material, and doors may also be metal or glass. Bifolds are most {{commonly}} made for closets, but may also be used as units between rooms. Bi-fold doors are essentially now doors that let the outside in. They open in concert; where the panels fold up against one another and are pushed together when opened. The main door panel (often known as the traffic door) is accompanied by a stack of panels that fold very neatly against one <b>another</b> <b>when</b> opened fully, which almost look like room dividers.|$|E
