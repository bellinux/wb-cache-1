40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} routing {{security in}} wireless sensor networks. Many sensor network routing protocols have been proposed, {{but none of}} them have been designed with security as a goal. We propose security goals for routing in sensor networks, show how <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> ad-hoc and peer-to-peer networks can be adapted into powerful <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> sensor networks, introduce two classes of novel <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> sensor networks — sinkholes and HELLO floods, and analyze the security of all the major sensor network routing protocols. We describe crippling <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> all of them and suggest countermeasures and design considerations. This is the first such analysis of secure routing in sensor networks. I...|$|R

It was planned in the most part by 'A' Force's Michael Crichton in Cairo. Deception efforts for Turpitude were focused in Syria, and around the ports of Tripoli and Lattakia. The Allies hoped to indicate a spoiling <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> the island of Rhodes before the main <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> Salonika.

5|$|BackupHDDVD {{represented}} {{the first known}} successful <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> AACS. The utility circumvents content protection by decrypting video files directly with AES, the underling cryptographic cipher used by AACS. Using this technique, BackupHDDVD is able to completely bypass the AACS chain of trust, rendering it immune to revocation. The cost of this immunity is that users are forced to rely on keys leaking from commercial player software to use BackupHDDVD with new discs.|$|E

5000|$|In September 1995, survey {{participants}} were asked whether they supported, opposed or had no opinion with regard to [...] "armed <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> Israeli army targets," [...] "armed <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> Israeli settlers," [...] and [...] "armed <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> Israeli civilian targets." [...] The majority supported the use of armed <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> Israeli military targets and settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Support crossed all party lines and groups, and was highest among the Islamic opposition (91% and 84%) and the leftists (90% and 89%), though a significant majority of those who supported the peace process also supported armed attacks on military targets and settlers (69% and 73%). To explain the apparent paradox in the latter position, Abusada quotes Shikaki (1996) who, [...] "contends that Palestinian support {{for the use of}} armed <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> Israeli military targets and settlers does not indicate 'opposition to the peace process but Palestinian insistence that the process entails an end to occupation and settlements.'" [...] Palestinian support for armed <b>attacks</b> <b>against</b> Israeli civilian targets in Israel was 20% overall, with support being highest among those affiliated with the Islamic opposition (42%) and the leftists (32%), and lowest among supporters of the peace process (12%) and the National Independents (10%).|$|R
