We conclude that there is no direct <b>causal</b> <b>link</b> from SES to mortality or to incidence of most sudden onset health conditions (accidents and some acute conditions), but there is an association of SES with incidence of gradual onset health conditions (mental conditions, and some degenerative and chronic conditions), due either to <b>causal</b> <b>links</b> or to persistent unobserved behavioral or genetic factors that have a common influence on both SES and innovations in health.

Using a proprietary database of business starts this paper quantitatively models the interaction between house price and business starts from 2005 to 2009.

Controlling for observable and unobservable city characteristics, we find the significance of a <b>causal</b> <b>link</b> between house prices and business starts depends {{on the size of}} the business starts; <b>causal</b> <b>link</b> exists between house prices and very small business, whereas, no significant <b>causal</b> <b>link</b> is seen for large business starts...|$|R

Thus, an empirical study was conducted on 60 three- to five-star rated hotels in Malaysia to achieve the objective of this study. The findings show that differentiation strategy has a <b>causal</b> <b>link</b> on customer orientation and service innovation. Importantly, this study found that customer orientation and service innovation mediated the <b>causal</b> <b>link</b> of differentiation strategy and organisational performance. This is the first study that identifies mediating effects of customer orientation and service innovation on differentiation and performance nexus in Malaysian hotel industry.

The author examines EU legal rules concerning Member State liability andtheir interaction with national law. As {{an example of a}} natio nal law, the author examines English law, particularly the rules which are relevant for causation in Member State liability cases.

40|$|The Authors, {{reviewing}} the Literature on asbestos-related Malignant Mesothelioma (MM), found {{that because of}} its very peculiar characteristics, the <b>causal</b> <b>link</b> between professional asbestos exposure {{and the development of}} this tumour is very difficult to define in respect to: diagnosis, <b>causal</b> <b>link</b> and individuation of possible culpable conducts. The evaluation of <b>causal</b> <b>link</b> in different medico-legal areas is studied by different criteria. In civil law the criterion of weak causality is followed to allow compensation for damages. For institutional purposes in INAIL, the definition of <b>causal</b> <b>link</b> is particularly facilitated by the legal presumption of origin. In fact it is sufficient, that asbestos-related lesions are ascertained in individuals who are or were exposed at any time of their professional life to the risk of inhaling asbestos fibres. In criminal law, the current approach of the Supreme Court is to demand evidence of strong causality, with a high logical probability and rational credibility, and beyond reasonable doubt, because criminal liability is personal as established in article 27 of the Italian Constitution. It is worth pointing out that all the levels of evidence indicated above must pass the test of scientific suitability or possibility...|$|R

Second section of the thesis is dedicated to the brief introduction to the issue of liability, as a specific phenomenon necessary for the functioning of the human community, which is in the provision of health care represented not only by civil liability, but also by ethical disciplinary or labour liability. Legal liability is however clearly the dominant and most efficient instrument to regulate the conduct of the legal norm addressees. Legal liability, defined as secondary legal obligation, arising {{as a result of a}} breach of the primary legal obligation, is described in the third section of this thesis according to its basic structural elements. These basic structural elements are: infringement, emergence of damage, fault and finally <b>causal</b> <b>link</b> between the unlawful conduct and the damage.
