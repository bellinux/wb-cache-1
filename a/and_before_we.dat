500|$|After a hiatus, Partridge {{returned}} in 2010 {{in a series}} of YouTube shorts, Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge, as the host of a digital radio show with co-presenter Sidekick Simon (Tim Key). Coogan co-wrote the shorts with brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons, who submitted scripts to his company Baby Cow Productions; the Gibbons have co-written every Partridge project since. According to Neil, Coogan [...] "invited us in, our sensibilities chimed, <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> knew it, Mid Morning Matters was up and running. We wrote it as if it was our baby, and though {{there was a sense that}} we were standing on the shoulders of giants, I think we were like two pairs of fresh eyes, and Steve seemed to fall in love with the character all over again." [...] Coogan said they chose the web format because [...] "it was a bit underground, a low-key environment in which to test the character out again. And the response was so good, we realised there was more fuel in the tank." [...] The shorts were later broadcast by Sky Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|Development of {{the game}} begun {{after the release of}} Nights into Dreams... in July 1996, after Sonic Team {{received}} a lot of letters from fans asking [...] "who Sonic was". Naka and Naoto Ohshima thought it was important to introduce people to the Sonic character, which was the basis for introducing [...] "Project Sonic" [...] to the public. Until the release of Sonic Jam, the studio themselves had not worked on a Sonic title since Sonic & Knuckles in 1994, in which Naka thought that Sonic Team had a good rest period to [...] "recharge our batteries" [...] and had new ideas regarding a new game. [...] "Sonic World"—Sonic Jams 3D hub world—served as a prototype for the first fully 3D Sonic game—Sonic Adventure—which began development for the Saturn but was moved to its successor, the Dreamcast. In a retrospective interview, Naka stated that the 3D section of Sonic Jam was part of an experiment to see how a Sonic the Hedgehog game would work in full 3D. [...] "Sonic World" [...] uses the same engine as Nights; there is speculation that Naka's refusal to share the Nights engine with the Sega Technical Institute (STI) team developing Sonic X-treme—a factor in the latter's cancellation—was motivated by his preference for Sonic Team's own efforts to create an original 3D Sonic title. Naka later expressed [...] "relief" [...] that X-treme was cancelled. Naka and Ohshima reflected that the most difficult part during the development process was gathering game-specific information in [...] "Sonic World", as [...] "there are so many games we have never even heard of... Sega's a big company <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> knew it lots of different game systems had sprung up (including Game Gear, Master System and Pico)." ...|$|E
2500|$|We were {{so caught}} up in our own wild ride that we were being swept along doing what we were doing, and, I mean, at the time, we were meeting all these bands that we idolised and, and, were big fans of ... and, um, got to play gigs with them all ... The first tour we went on, then led into the next tour <b>and,</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> knew it, we were on the road to pretty much ten years solid.|$|E

2500|$|Otis Redding {{recorded}} a rendition of [...] "Satisfaction" [...] for his album Otis Blue/Otis Redding Sings Soul, released in 1965. Redding {{claimed that he}} did not know the lyrics of the song. [...] "I use a lot of words different than the Stones' version," [...] he noted. [...] "That's because I made them up." [...] Of that session, Steve Cropper said, [...] "...if you ever listened to the record you can hardly understand the lyrics, right? I set down to a record player and copied down what I thought the lyrics were and I handed Otis a piece of paper <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> got through with the cut, he threw the paper on the floor and that was it." [...] Music writer Robert Christgau described it as an [...] "anarchic reading" [...] of the Stones' original. Redding's soul-style arrangement featured horns playing the main riff, as Keith Richards had originally intended. In 2003, Ronnie Wood noted that the Rolling Stones' later concert renditions of the number reflect Redding's interpretation.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the events}} of [...] (1985), the Bene Tleilax have been all but {{eradicated}} by the Honored Matres save for one Master, Scytale; he is a ghola of the original Scytale of Dune Messiah, somehow having ascended from Face Dancer to Master. He tells the Bene Gesserit leader Darwi Odrade that [...] "Descendants of people we sent into the Scattering returned with captive Futars. [...] A mingling of human and cat, as you doubtless know. [...] But they did not reproduce in our tanks. [...] <b>And</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> could determine why, the ones brought to us died." [...] Both Odrade and Scytale realize this was a ploy of the descendant Tleilaxu to gain {{the confidence of the}} Masters and yet not divulge their secrets. Held against his will by the Bene Gesserit, Scytale's secret bargaining tool is a hidden nullentropy capsule containing cells carefully and secretly collected by the Tleilaxu for millennia, including the cells of Tleilaxu Masters, Face Dancers, Paul Atreides, Chani, Gurney Halleck, Thufir Hawat and other legendary figures. He intends to not only grow his own life-sustaining ghola, but to resurrect the rest of his order as well. In the meantime, he has given the Bene Gesserit enough of the axlotl technology to grow their own gholas, in particular a replacement for their military genius Miles Teg.|$|E

60|$|Mor. The {{other way}} to the arbour with him; <b>and</b> make haste, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> are discovered.|$|R
60|$|Answer. True; {{but that}} is not all. He died to put us into the {{personal}} possession of pardon: Yea, to put us into a personal possession of it, <b>and</b> that <b>before</b> <b>we</b> know it.|$|R

60|$|There was a deal of {{handshaking}} <b>and</b> congratulations <b>before</b> <b>we</b> {{settled down}} to anything like rational talk, and then Jerry and I told how we found the captain, and what had happened since Darius left the smoke-house.|$|R
