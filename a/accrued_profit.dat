China's overall weak {{legal system}} {{environment}} and clear regional legal system differences existing {{side by side}} provides the research background for us to study the relationship between accounting firm scale, legal environment and audit quality. In this paper, using the data of 2014, under China's unique legal environment background, classify according to accounting firm scale and background, take manageable <b>accrued</b> <b>profit</b> instead of actual audit quality, empirically testify the relationship between legal environment, firm size and audit quality. With the development of market economy and particularity of certified public accountants work, audit quality directly relates to healthy development of capital market. The scale of accounting firms must, therefore, improve information quality as the premise, and large-scale development must also be {{on the basis of}} ensured audit quality. In our country, whether {{there is a difference between}} large and small audit quality, whether it relates to law environment, whether there are other influence factors, the academia has not yet been determined. And discuss the accounting problems in China shall consider China's national conditions. In general, the rule of law environment is weak in our country. From the angle of region, local legal environment development is not balanced. Will legal system differences in different areas, then, affect different size firm's audit quality? I. ACCOUNTING FIRM SCALE MEASURE In the study of accounting firm scale and audit quality, accounting firm can be divided into N big and not N big dichotomy, which is widely used in the literature at home and abroad. Especially in western developed countries, the division of N big and not N big is very stable. A. Research design 1. Research methods We choose to have clustering analysis with a strong objectivity to test classification results significantly and can comprehensively consider certified public accountants ’ indicators to analyze 2014 accounting firm situation. 2. Data collection (1) Data selection indicators In this paper also uses multiple indicators measure in the course of study...|$|E
40|$|Cashmere Forest is {{currently}} a production forest comprised of mostly radiata pine (c. 85 %), Douglas fir (c. 5 %) and some non plantation areas. The Port Hills Park Trust Board (PHPTB) is interested in purchasing Cashmere Forest {{for the purpose of}} creating a public forest park environment where forestry, indigenous biodiversity, recreation and the environment are goals of sustainable management. For this purpose this draft forest management (DFM) plan has been prepared. The preparation of the Cashmere DFM plan comprised three main components: 1. An economic analysis of the current plantation component of Cashmere Forest. 2. Preparation of a draft forest management plan which encompasses the management of plantation and non plantation areas. 3. Preparation of a geographic information system (GIS) for Cashmere Forest. Economic analysis evaluated clearfell, coupe (2 to 5 ha), and a mixture of coupe and continuous canopy management (CCM) as harvesting scenarios. The coupe CCM mix was recommended for implementation primarily as it best suited long term management goals for Cashmere Forest Park while also returning modest value (NPV $ 561, 966). Normal cashflow analysis was also used to analyse cashflow over the first thirty years of operation from 2007. Under coupe/CCM, <b>accrued</b> <b>profit</b> does not become permanently positive until around 2019 due to initial infrastructure costs. Accrued revenue culminates at around 4 million after 30 years. This figure may drop following implementation of high pruning, alternative growth models and indigenous restoration. The Cashmere DFM plan begins with the 200 year vision which sees a Forest Park ecosystem that achieves production, environmental, ecological and recreational goals appropriate to its Port Hills location. Production forestry is practiced through the selective harvesting of a range of naturally regenerated exotic and restored indigenous species. Landscape, soil and water resources are sustainably managed through the retention of a mixed forest canopy. The forest park has been significantly augmented with indigenous flora and fauna typical of the Port Hills and ecologically significant areas are managed specifically for their indigenous biodiversity. Park recreational users are enjoying ongoing utilisation of a unique Canterbury landscape. Plantation forest management involves coupes of between 2 to 5 ha which will be harvested with cable or ground based systems with areas split approximately 50 : 50 between the two. Cable harvesting will be carried out with a swing yarder system with ground based operations carried out with track skidders. CCM will be carried out on a trial basis in three compartments. Re-establishment of plantation areas will aim towards occupying around 58 % of Cashmere Forest, comprised of areas of radiate pine 65 %, radiata pine/eucalypt 24 %, Douglas fir/eucalypt 5 % and Alternative species 6 %. Non plantation areas are identified as either bluff, track or clearing. Within each area there may be one or more vegetation type including tussock grassland, mixed shrubland, rock association and any mixture of the three. It is proposed that the non plantation area will eventually increase to include riparian buffers 31 %, restored native 55 %, bluff 10 % and track 4 % areas, reflecting the long term vision of increased native areas in Cashmere Forest. Monitoring of forest operations, restoration, recreation and management progress will be integral to the successful implementation of the Cashmere DFM plan. A database of information will be created to allow periodical reviews of processes and predictions and reconciliation of costs and revenues associated with the management of Cashmere Forest. Periodical reviews will also be undertaken by an independent management advisory group who can liaise with the project manager of Cashmere Forest Park to discuss issues and aid planning and ensure the successful establishment of this unique park resource...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the burgeoning research on inequality and top incomes around the globe by presenting the first available estimates of top income shares and effective income tax rates in contemporary Chile based on analysis of anonymous income tax return microdata. We {{pay special attention to}} business income, which dominates {{at the top of the}} distribution. Our analysis includes not only distributed profits, but also the large proportion of <b>accrued</b> <b>profits</b> retained by firms. Our most conservative estimate of the income share received by the top 1 per cent of Chileans, constructed directly from income reported to the tax agency, is 15 per cent for 2005 and 2009 – the fifth highest share reported in the top incomes literature. When distributed profits are adjusted for widespread under-reporting, we estimate that the top 1 per cent share increases to roughly 22 per cent. When distributed profits are replaced by <b>accrued</b> <b>profits</b> in our definition of income, we obtain 19 per cent as our lowest estimate for the top 1 per cent share. Despite this impressive income concentration, the rich in Chile pay modest effective income tax rates. The top 1 per cent pay an average effective rate of 16 - 17 per cent when distributed profits are not adjusted for under-reporting, and less than 9 per cent when distributed profits are adjusted to national accounts. When we include corporate income tax and <b>accrued</b> <b>profits</b> in our analysis (without adjustments), the effective tax burden for the top 1 per cent is 16 per cent...|$|R

The exclusion of easterners from power caused many in the east to fear that oil revenues would be used to benefit areas in the north and west rather than their own. The desire to <b>accrue</b> <b>profits</b> from oil revenues combined with ethnic tensions acted as a catalyst for the Igbo-spearheaded secession. Additionally, despite his denials in later years, it appears that Ojukwu's insistence on secession at the time was heavily influenced by his knowledge of the extent of the area's oil reserves.|$|R

Equity is the risk reserve of the corporation. The relation between equity and risk bearing ability allows defining the necessary amount of equity by analyzing the corporate risks. Furthermore, it leads to rules for the valuation of assets, the creation of reserves and as to the board’s duty of care on how to pursue the corporate strategy...|$|R
