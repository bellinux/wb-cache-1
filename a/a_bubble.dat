25|$|An {{economic}} bubble or asset bubble (sometimes {{also referred to}} as <b>a</b> speculative <b>bubble,</b> <b>a</b> market <b>bubble,</b> <b>a</b> price <b>bubble,</b> <b>a</b> financial <b>bubble,</b> <b>a</b> speculative mania, or a balloon) is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value. though theories of financial crises such as debt-deflation and the Financial Instability Hypothesis suggest instead that bubbles burst progressively, with the most vulnerable (most highly-leveraged) assets failing first, and then the collapse spreading throughout the economy.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>bubbler</b> is <b>a</b> mix of a bong and a pipe.

50|$|An {{economic}} bubble or asset bubble (sometimes {{also referred to}} as <b>a</b> speculative <b>bubble,</b> <b>a</b> market <b>bubble,</b> <b>a</b> price <b>bubble,</b> <b>a</b> financial <b>bubble,</b> <b>a</b> speculative mania, or a balloon) is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value. It could also be described as a situation in which asset prices appear to be based on implausible or inconsistent views about the future. Asset bubbles date back as far as the 1600s and are now widely regarded as a recurrent feature of modern economic history. Historically, the Dutch Golden Age's Tulipmania (in the mid-1630s) is often considered the first recorded {{economic bubble}}.|$|R
5|$|Bubbles is an arcade {{video game}} {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1982. The player uses a joystick to control <b>a</b> <b>bubble</b> {{in a kitchen}} sink. The object is to progress through levels by cleaning the sink while avoiding enemies. The game received a mixed reception from critics.|$|E
5|$|A virus particle, {{also known}} as a virion, {{consists}} of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), helical or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>bubble</b> of lipid (fat) called an envelope.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Asylum {{has also}} been praised for Gaspar Saladino's {{distinctive}} lettering work and giving characters their own fonts. The practice of giving characters customized lettering treatments has since become widespread, especially in DC's Vertigo line and many Marvel comics. Different speech bubbles were used for many characters: Batman's is black with white lettering, Maxie gets blue with a Greek font, while Joker's speech is without <b>a</b> <b>bubble</b> at all; the red, ink-spattered script used for his dialogue is as ungovernable as the character himself.|$|E

40|$|In this work, a phenomenological {{model has}} been {{developed}} for examining the particle scale degradation of biomass. Furthermore, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{model has been}} developed to study the mixing/segregation behaviour of biomass with other solid phases such as biochar in <b>a</b> <b>bubbling</b> fluidized bed. Finally, a multi-scale CFD model has been formulated for analysing the pyrolysis of biomass in presence of biochar in <b>a</b> <b>bubbling</b> fluidized bed...|$|R
5|$|Diving beetles, {{such as the}} Dytiscidae, carry <b>a</b> <b>bubble</b> of {{air with}} them when they dive. Such <b>a</b> <b>bubble</b> may be {{contained}} under the elytra or against the body by specialized hydrophobic hairs. The bubble covers {{at least some of the}} spiracles, permitting air to enter the tracheae. The function of the bubble is not only to contain a store of air, but to act as a physical gill. The air that it traps is in contact with oxygenated water, so as the animal's consumption depletes the oxygen in the bubble, more oxygen can diffuse in to replenish it. Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water than either oxygen or nitrogen, so it readily diffuses out faster than in. Nitrogen is the most plentiful gas in the bubble, and the least soluble, so it constitutes a relatively static component of the bubble and acts as a stable medium for respiratory gases to accumulate in and pass through. Occasional visits to the surface are sufficient for the beetle to re-establish the constitution of the bubble.|$|E
5|$|Given that E°(O2/H2O) = +1.229V, {{which is}} less than +1.395V, it would be {{expected}} that chlorine {{should be able to}} oxidise water to oxygen and hydrochloric acid. However, the kinetics of this reaction are unfavorable, and there is also <b>a</b> <b>bubble</b> overpotential effect to consider, so that electrolysis of aqueous chloride solutions evolves chlorine gas and not oxygen gas, a fact that is very useful for the industrial production of chlorine.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 DCIEM (Defence and Civil Institution of Environmental Medicine, Canada) {{released}} No-Decompression and Decompression Tables {{based on}} the Kidd/Stubbs serial compartment model and extensive ultrasonic testing, and Edward D.

5|$|Polikarpov began {{preliminary}} design of two updated {{versions of the}} I-185 design in February 1943. The I-187 had a M-71F engine of 1,640kW (2,200hp), <b>a</b> <b>bubble</b> canopy, four 20mm cannons, eight RS-82 rockets and an estimated maximum speed of 710km/h (441mph). The I-188 used an improved M-90 engine with 1,552kW (2,080hp) and used the same armament as the I-187, although the fuselage was slimmer {{than that of the}} I-187 because of the slimmer engine.|$|E
5|$|Seizing upon a new {{development}} to visualize particle tracks, created by Donald Glaser and known as <b>a</b> <b>bubble</b> chamber, Alvarez realized the device was just what was needed, if only it {{could be made to}} function with liquid hydrogen. Hydrogen nuclei, which are protons, made the simplest and most desirable target for interactions with the particles produced by the Bevatron. He began a development program to build a series of small chambers, and championed the device to Ernest Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|The {{practicality}} of {{this approach}} is questionable with modern material science, but cannot yet be ruled out. A 100% reflective statite deployed around the Sun would have an overall density of 0.78 grams per square meter of sail. To illustrate the low mass of the required materials, consider that the total mass of <b>a</b> <b>bubble</b> of such material 1 AU in radius would be about 2.17 kg, which is about the same mass as the asteroid Pallas. Another illustration: Regular printing paper has a density of around 80 g/m2.|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches {{occupy a}} wide range of habitats. Many live in leaf litter, among the stems of matted vegetation, in rotting wood, in holes in stumps, in {{cavities}} under bark, under log piles and among debris. Some live in arid regions and have developed mechanisms to survive without access to water sources. Others are aquatic, living near the surface of water bodies, including bromeliad phytotelmata, and diving to forage for food. Most of these respire by piercing the water surface with the tip of the abdomen which acts as a snorkel, but some carry <b>a</b> <b>bubble</b> of air under their thoracic shield when they submerge. Others live in the forest canopy where they {{may be one of the}} main types of invertebrate present. Here they may hide during the day in crevices, among dead leaves, in bird and insect nests or among epiphytes, emerging at night to feed.|$|E
5|$|Reach {{features}} updated {{versions of}} old weapons, plus new weapons fulfilling various combat roles. In Halo 3, players can carry single-use equipment power-ups that offer temporary offensive or defensive advantages. This system of single-use equipment is replaced in Reach by reusable and persistent armor abilities that remain with a character {{until they are}} replaced. The abilities are a jetpack; active camouflage; sprint; hologram, which creates a facsimile of the player running towards a target point; drop shield, which creates <b>a</b> <b>bubble</b> that heals those inside and protects them from {{a limited amount of}} damage; and armor lock, which immobilizes the player but grants invincibility for a brief period of time. When playing as Covenant Elites, players also have access to an evade armor ability.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurs at}} the termination shock, which is roughly 80–100AU from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200AU from the Sun downwind. Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses and becomes more turbulent, forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath. This structure is thought to look and behave {{very much like a}} comet's tail, extending outward for a further 40AU on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind; evidence from Cassini and Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into <b>a</b> <b>bubble</b> shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic field.|$|E
40|$|Drag {{and lift}} forces acting on <b>a</b> spherical gas <b>bubble</b> in <b>a</b> {{homogeneous}} linear shear flow were numerically investigated {{by means of}} a three-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS) based on a marker and cell (MAC) method. The effects of fluid shear rate and particle Reynolds number on drag and lift forces acting on <b>a</b> spherical gas <b>bubble</b> were compared with those on <b>a</b> spherical inviscid <b>bubble.</b> The results show that the drag force acting on <b>a</b> spherical air <b>bubble</b> in <b>a</b> linear shear flow increases with fluid shear rate of ambient flow. The behaviour of the lift force on <b>a</b> spherical air <b>bubble</b> is quite similar to that on <b>a</b> spherical inviscid <b>bubble,</b> but the effects of fluid shear rate on the lift force acting on <b>an</b> air <b>bubble</b> in the linear shear flow become bigger than that acting on <b>an</b> inviscid <b>bubble</b> in the particle Reynolds number region of 1 ≤Rep≤ 300.

5|$|The {{combined}} {{concentrations of}} gases {{in any given}} tissue depend {{on the history of}} pressure and gas composition. Under equilibrium conditions, the total concentration of dissolved gases is less than the ambient pressure—as oxygen is metabolized in the tissues, and the carbon dioxide produced is much more soluble. However, during a reduction in ambient pressure, the rate of pressure reduction may exceed the rate at which gas is eliminated by diffusion and perfusion. If the concentration gets too high, it may reach a stage where bubble formation can occur in the supersaturated tissues. When the pressure of gases in <b>a</b> <b>bubble</b> exceed the combined external pressures of ambient pressure and the surface tension of the bubble-liquid interface, the bubbles grow, and this growth can damage tissue.|$|E
5|$|The station {{provided}} two permanent crew quarters, the Kayutkas, phonebox-sized booths set {{towards the}} rear of the core module, each featuring a tethered sleeping bag, a fold-out desk, a porthole, and storage for personal effects. Visiting crews had no allocated sleep module, instead attaching a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall; US astronauts installed themselves within Spektr until a collision with a Progress spacecraft caused the depressurisation of that module. It was important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts could wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air, because <b>a</b> <b>bubble</b> of their own exhaled carbon dioxide had formed around their heads.|$|E
