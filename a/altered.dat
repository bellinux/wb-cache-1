40|$|Whenever a rule is contractible, the law must {{establish}} separate {{rules governing}} how private parties can contract around the default legal treatment. To date, contract theorists have not developed satisfying theories {{for how to}} set “altering rules,” the rules that establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for displacing a default. This Article argues that when setting <b>altering</b> rules, efficiency-minded lawmakers should consider the costs of <b>altering,</b> the costs of various kinds of error, {{and the possibility that}} <b>altering</b> can impose negative externalities on others. There are two broad reasons for structuring <b>altering</b> rules that deviate from merely minimizing the transaction cost of <b>altering.</b> First, the Article develops conditions in which minimizing the costs of party error (especially nondrafter error) and third-party error (especially judicial error) will be paramount. It proposes a variety of <b>altering</b> interventions—including “train-and-test” <b>altering</b> rules, “clarity-requiring” <b>altering</b> rules, “password” <b>altering</b> rules, and “thought-requiring” <b>altering</b> rules—that might be deployed to reduce <b>altering</b> error. Second, when externality concerns or paternalistic concerns to protect the contractors themselves are insufficient to justify a full-blown mandatory rule, lawmakers might at times usefully impose “impeding” <b>altering</b> rules, which deter subsets of contractors from contracting for legally disfavored provisions. Impeding <b>altering</b> rules produce an intermediate category of “quasimandatory” or “sticky default” rules, which manage but do not eliminate externalities and paternalism concerns. These two deviations from transaction-cost minimization can often be usefully complemented by a third category of <b>altering</b> rules—what this Article calls “altering penalties”—which penalize one or both contractors who utilize disfavored <b>altering</b> methods. <b>Altering</b> penalties can channel contractors’ <b>altering</b> efforts toward means that better reduce error or better control externalities or paternalism. More explicitly theorizing <b>altering</b> rules as a distinct category of law can make visible legal issues that have largely gone unnoticed and lead toward the development of more defensible choices about how best to regulate opt-out...|$|R

40|$|TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements) is an {{advanced}} space interferometer, {{composed of two}} TerraSAR-X satellites ying in close formation. The primary goal of TanDEM-X mission is the generation of a global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of an unprecedented accuracy, coverage and quality. One of the main issues facing Interferometric SAR (InSAR) products is the interferometric phase noise coming from diffrent sources. The typical post-acquisition work-around for the noise problem is <b>altering</b> of interferograms. A plethora of <b>alters</b> have been suggested for the noise reduction and phase recovery. These <b>alters</b> are based on different principles and attained different degrees of success. One of the recently suggested <b>alters</b> {{seems to have a}} good potential in tackling the phase noise problem, the Non-Local InSAR (NL-InSAR) <b>alter.</b> This smart <b>alter</b> surpasses the performance of conventional <b>alters</b> by intelligently selecting the pixels to be averaged {{in order to reduce the}} noise and preserve structures. In this thesis, an implementation of the NL-InSAR <b>alter</b> is realized, with special attention paid to the heavy computational cost synonymous with nonlocal means concept. Various algorithmic and programming techniques are pursued to reduce the computational burden and bring the <b>alter</b> to an operational state suitable for large InSAR data-sets. To bring the NL-InSAR <b>alter</b> to a new level of performance, a simple improvement to the <b>alter</b> algorithm has been suggested. The performance of the modifed NL-InSAR <b>alter</b> is compared against the original NL-InSAR <b>alter</b> and to other conventional <b>alters,</b> realistic simulations have been done and the results are presented. The last part of the thesis is about evaluation of the NL-InSAR <b>alter</b> as a suggested alternative to the current Boxcar <b>alter</b> used in the standard TanDEM-X DEM generation. A systematic evaluation of NL-InSAR DEMs was done using few TanDEM-X data sets, and compared against the standard TanDEM-X DEMs...|$|R
