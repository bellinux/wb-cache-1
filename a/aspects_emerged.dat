Aspects relate closely to programming concepts like subjects, mixins, and delegation. Other {{ways to use}} aspect-oriented programming paradigms include Composition Filters and the hyperslices approach. Since at least the 1970s, developers have been using forms of interception and dispatch-patching that resemble some of the implementation methods for AOP, but these never had the semantics that the crosscutting specifications provide written in one place.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to carry out an exploratory investigation into the consumers preference for a certain store based on the storefront windows (in terms of entry decision), with emphasis on the current most attractive interactive technologies. Thus, we examine the extent to which an exploratory sample of consumers is influenced by storefront interactive technologies. Emotional <b>aspects</b> <b>emerge</b> as the most influencing ones in the case of traditional storefronts, while both emotional and functional <b>aspects</b> <b>emerge</b> as the most influencing factors while considering the integration of interactive technologies. In particular, our results shed light on the way these elements can be managed for the design of future attractive storefront windows, by providing important insights for scholars and practitioners...|$|R

Adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy and combined chemoradiation are used for esophageal cancer patients after esophagectomy. Outcomes of these approaches are analyzed in the literature.

In contrast to formal degree modules, non-formal or SLPs give lecturers the opportunity to adapt quickly to market needs. The study focused on the results of two evaluations that were completed in 2006 and 2009. The purpose in both instances was to determine the relevance of the programme and especially the extent to which students can and do apply the new knowledge in their work environment. Overall, the results indicated positive satisfaction with the programme, including its contents and delivery mode.

40|$|Strategic {{environmental}} Assessment (SEA) is {{a decision}} support instrument for predicting and evaluating the likely environmental effects of implementing a policy, plan or programme. SEA can consider the cumulative impacts {{of more than one}} project or activity on the same environmen- tal component. This paper discusses the analysis of cumulative effects in SEA, with reference to spatial planning by: providing a review of key concepts and methods related to cumulative effects literature; presenting a rationale for the inclusion of cumulative effects in SEA of spatial plans; advancing a proposal to address cumulative effects in different SEA stages. The paper concludes that SEA offers the opportunity to support a better management of cumulative effects arising from many local-level spatial planning decisions. Three <b>aspects</b> <b>emerged</b> as critical to ensure good practices: the selection of valued environmental components, the adoption of future-oriented approaches, and the use of spatially-explicit information...|$|E

Does the new social media undermine our ability to recognise truth?” (Peters, 2017, p. 564). Or, have lies always shaped the fiction that politics and media have agreed to tell? Over the three workshops, some important common <b>aspects</b> <b>emerged</b> repeatedly concerning especially the issues of misleading information and manipulated truth that both formal and informal media are able to provide.|$|E

Although the machine is subjected to the cited directive, it is not regulated by a specific standard. After {{a brief description of the}} accident course, the circumstances that made it possible are carefully analysed in order to verify a possible unpremeditated omission of the necessary safety measures. Particular attention is given to the characterization of the normal use and of the reasonably expected uses of the machinery: such issues are widely analysed and discussed. The authors conclude that the institution of a prohibition for a specific type of usage is not sufficient to exclude that type as a reasonably expected use...|$|E

40|$|In {{the studies}} of the coastal {{defenses}} of the Kingdom of Naples, {{there is a widespread}} tendency to focus attention on the viceroy phase, extending its unitary nature, which in some cases does not correspond to what really happened. Some {{of the results of the}} survey on the "defensive minorities" of the north coast of the Capitanata, from the mouth of Fortore to Peschici, are presented in this paper. In particular we have investigated two towers of the Viceroys period, which don’t look to follow the standard architectural model provided by the decree of Pedro Afàn de Ribera: the Tower on the Fortore (Lesina, Italy) and the Tower of San Menaio (Vico del Gargano, Italy). The investigation covered the digital documentation of these two buildings and a preliminary analysis from a typological, stratigraphic and conservation point of view. Some interesting <b>aspects</b> <b>emerged</b> about material history and the transformations of the structures over time, but also significant relationships with buildings of the same period...|$|E
40|$|Since 1988, {{the right}} to health {{has been the focus}} of {{research}} in health and law, under distinct perspectives and approaches.

By consulting the technical and scientific literature on the theme, starting with its regulation in the Brazilian Federal Constitution of 1988 until 2015, and using the descriptor “right to health” and the qualifier “history” to list the scientific articles and identify the perspectives studies. Four main <b>aspects</b> <b>emerged</b> from the reading of the selected articles: sociopolitical, legislative, bioethical and specific health demands that guided the discussion and elaboration of the concept right to health. It can be said that the definition of right to health demands a historical, cultural, political, economic and social framework and depends: on its regulatory organization, on its nature (individual and collective), on the moral responsibility and the acknowledgement of its enforceability...|$|E
30|$|To {{look at the}} rubrics in more detail, CRT 17 is now briefly presented. The task asks: “After {{construction}} of the Vajont Dam, and recognising the possibility of hillside failure, outline two planning measures an engineer could have suggested to minimise potential harm to people.” (Tremblay et al. 2012, 263). Although only two planning measures as requested, the scoring guide presents seven possible ways that the students could receive the two score points. This initiative accounted for the cross-cultural concern that different students in different countries would think differently about how to approach the item. The cross-cultural <b>aspects</b> <b>emerged</b> when thinking about these planning measures throughout the iterative process of scoring design. In one country, the norm would be to set up sophisticated evacuation procedures. However, in another country, relocating the entire town {{was seen as the}} best response. The construct did not demarcate which option was best, as long as two planning measures were given, as this demonstrated the student’s capacity to apply acquired competencies in a manner deemed ‘above content’.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the psychiatric symptoms associated with a diagnosis of eating disorders (ED) we have administered a new psychometric instrument: the Self Administrated Psychiatric Scales for Children and Adolescents (SAFA) test. SAFA was administered to a cohort of 97 patients, aged from 8. 8 to 18, with an ED diagnosis. Age, body mass index (BMI) and BMI standard deviation score were analyzed. Furthermore, while looking for linkable risk factors, we evaluated other data that took an influence over the SAFA profile, like parental separation and family components’ number. Compared to the range of statistical normality (based on Italian population), patients with bulimia nervosa or binge-eating disorder showed higher and pathologic values in specific subscales. When analyzing sex, males showed more pathologic values in most anxiety-related, obsessiveness–compulsiveness-related and insecurity subscales. A correlation among age, BMI and specific subscales (low self esteem, psychological <b>aspects)</b> <b>emerged</b> in participants with anorexia nervosa. In order to plan more appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in children or adolescents suffering from ED, the SAFA test {{can be an important}} instrument to evaluate psychiatric symptoms.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the qualitative {{findings of a}} study exploring the transition from student to Registered Nurse and the catalytic effect {{of the way in}} which newly registered nurses are prepared for this role change. The study explored the experiences of one cohort of students undertaking the pre-registration Advanced Diploma in Nursing Studies at the University of Sheffield. Data were collected pre-qualification and post-qualification in order to compare the expectations and reality of the transition period. Two key <b>aspects</b> <b>emerged,</b> one relating to the experience of students undertaking the final module of the course and the other to preceptorship once qualified. These two areas of practice have been the focus of development following dissemination of the research findings in the local NHS Hospitals. The study suggests that the transition period remains very stressful for some nurses, because of both pre-registration educational issues and the level of support received once qualified. Careful planning of the student experience in the final year and addressing inconsistencies within the preceptorship programmes of newly qualified nurses are needed. The study is stimulating change in the local NHS hospitals, with the aim of enhancing the overall experience of student nurses and newly qualified staff alike. </p...|$|E

The local consultancy centres have a precarious endowment (office, computer, telephone), lacking transport means, training rooms, endowment with specific auxiliary means. Between consultancy methods, the biggest share is held by individual office consultancy. Group consultancy, which has the highest efficiency, is done sporadically because of reduced financial means. A lack of interest from local authorities is manifested for consultancy activity.
