25|$|In April 2, 1831, Daniel Van Slyke reported: it is {{with great}} {{difficulty}} {{we have been able}} to preserve order among the boatmen, who in striving to push forward for a preference in passing the several locks are sometimes dis-posed to injure each other’s boats as a means of carrying their point. An unfortunate in-stance of this kind happened on Wednesday last at the locks on the 9th section.

25|$|Simpson now {{announced}} that his target {{would be a}} run a minute, an ordinary rate maybe in days gone, but a breakneck almost in the sixties, what with slow over-rates <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> accent on defence. Yet Australia, {{give or take a}} few minutes, achieved it, their captain leading the way with the highest opening stand ever, in a partnership with Lawry, for Australia against England: 244. I never remember seeing better running between wickets than of these two – and found myself comparing them, in fact, with Hobbs and Sutcliffe. With the field constantly changing over as right- and left-hander alternated, England, in much heat, sweated and chased unavailingly.|$|E
25|$|The {{height of}} the famine was reached in 1317, as the wet weather continued. Finally, in that summer, the weather {{returned}} to its normal patterns.

Historians debate the toll, but it is estimated that 10–25% of the population of many cities and towns died. While the Black Death (1338–1375) would kill more people, it often swept through an area in a matter of months, but the Great Famine lingered for years, prolonging the suffering of the populace.|$|E

25|$|The title-winning team owed {{a lot to}} the midfield. The {{side had}} little {{international}} talent in attack or defence (although full backs Tony Dorigo and Mel Sterland were both full internationals) <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of the onus was on Strachan, McAllister, Wales international Speed and England's Batty to provide that required class. The quality of the midfield was that any of the four could slot into whichever area they needed to be in, be it left, right or centre, though Batty tended to be the holding midfield player whilst McAllister, Strachan and Speed provided the creativity. McAllister's dead-ball skills were also utilised by top-scorer Lee Chapman, who scored the majority of his goals from headers and thrived off the service provided by McAllister and Strachan's free kicks.|$|E
25|$|As {{recycling}} {{rates are}} low <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> metal {{has already been}} extracted, some landfills now contain a higher concentrations of metal than mines themselves. This {{is especially true of}} aluminium, used in cans, and precious metals, found in discarded electronics. Furthermore, waste after 15 years has still not broken down, so less processing would be required when compared to mining ores. A study undertaken by Cranfield University has found £360 million of metals could be mined from just 4 landfill sites. There is also up to 20MJ/kg of energy in waste, potentially making the re-extraction more profitable. However, although the first landfill mine opened in Tel Aviv, Israel in 1953, little work has followed due to the abundance of accessible ores.|$|E
25|$|Once {{maturity}} is reached, {{the chance}} of death seems not to increase with age. The survivorship curve of box turtles is therefore probably {{similar to that of}} other long-living turtles. The average life span of adult box turtles is 50 years, while a significant portion lives over 100 years. The age of a growing box turtle in the wild can not be accurately estimated by counting the growth rings on the scutes; Their growth is directly affected by the amount of food, types of food, water, illness, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more. Box turtle eggs are flexible, oblong and are (depending on the taxon) on average 2–4cm long weighing 5-11 g. The normal clutch size is 1-7 eggs. In captivity and in the southern end of their range, box turtles can have more than one clutch per year, while the average clutch size is larger in more northern populations.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1315 unusually heavy rain began in much of Europe. Throughout the spring and summer, it {{continued}} to rain and the temperature remained cool. These conditions caused widespread crop failures. The straw and hay for the animals could not be cured {{and there was no}} fodder for livestock. The price of food began to rise, doubling in England between spring and midsummer. Salt, the only way to cure and preserve meat, was difficult to obtain because it could not be extracted through evaporation in the wet weather; it peaked in price in the period 1310–20, reaching double the price from the decade before. In {{the spring of}} 1316 it continued to rain on a European population deprived of energy and reserves to sustain itself. All segments of society from nobles to peasants were affected, but especially the peasants who were {{the overwhelming majority of the}} population and who had no reserve food supplies. The height of the famine was reached in 1317 as the wet weather continued. Finally, in the summer the weather returned to its normal patterns. By now, however, people were so weakened by diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and tuberculosis, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of the seed stock had been eaten, that it was not until 1325 that the food supply returned to relatively normal conditions and the population began to increase again.|$|E
25|$|In 1859, the Pensioner Scheme was {{abandoned}} by the British government and ownership of Fort Malden {{was turned over to}} the province of Ontario. On June 8, 1859, an Order in Council within the Ontario government determined that Fort Malden would be recommissioned as a provincial insane asylum. Fort Malden was one of many examples where prior ordnance lands were repurposed by order of the province to become asylums, hospitals, or prisons, as these prior forts already possessed many fortified buildings and defences suited for institutional facilities. It was determined that the Malden Lunatic Asylum would act {{as an extension of the}} Toronto Lunatic Asylum to house surplus patients. However, many of Fort Malden’s buildings had been relatively neglected <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of the first couple years of the Fort’s history as an asylum was allotted to necessary reconstruction. This remodeling was performed primarily under the architectural supervision of Kivas Tully who used several of the patients as labourers to help build and remodel the asylum's structures. Some of the early remodeling was concerned with repairing the barracks to serve as separate wings for the male and female patients, as well as converting the brick hospital into a kitchen, with the guard house becoming the porter’s apartment, used to house the water supply pump, and the officer’s quarters becoming the home of the doctor’s family.|$|E
