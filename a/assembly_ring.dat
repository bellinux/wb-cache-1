Here we used a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches to understand how these proteins function at contractile rings. We find that <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> is delayed in Myo 2 p motor and tropomyosin mutants, but occurs prematurely in cells engineered to express two copies of myo 2. Thus, the timing of <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> responds to changes in Myo 2 p cellular levels and motor activity, {{and the emergence of}} tropomyosin-bound actin filaments. Doubling Myo 2 p levels suppresses defects in <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> associated with a tropomyosin mutant, suggesting a role for tropomyosin in maximizing Myo 2 p function. Correspondingly, tropomyosin increases Myo 2 p actin affinity and ATPase activity and promotes Myo 2 p-driven actin filament gliding in motility assays. Tropomyosin achieves this by favoring the strong actin-bound state of Myo 2 p. This mode of regulation reflects a role for tropomyosin in specifying and stabilizing actomyosin interactions, which facilitates contractile <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> in the fission yeast system...|$|R

40|$|The Seasat {{spacecraft}} failed on October 9, 1978, after satisfactory {{operation in}} orbit for 105 days, {{as a result}} of a loss of electrical power in the Agena bus that was used as a part of the spacecraft. This loss of power was caused by a massive and progressive short in one of the slip <b>ring</b> <b>assemblies</b> that was used to connect the rotating solar arrays into the power subsystem. The most likely cause of this short was the initiation of an arc between adjacent slip <b>ring</b> brush <b>assemblies.</b> The triggering mechanism of this arc could have been either a wire-to-brush assembly contact, a brush-to-brush contact, or a momentary short caused by a contaminant that bridged internal components of opposite electrical polarity. The slip <b>ring</b> <b>assembly,</b> as used in the Seasat spacecraft, was connected into the power subsystem in such a way that most of the adjacent brush assemblies were of opposite electrical polarity. This wiring arrangement, together with the congested nature of the design itself, made the Seasat slip <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> a unique, first-of-a-kind component that was particularly prone to shorting. The possibility of slip ring failures resulting from placing opposite electrical polarities on adjacent brush assemblies was known at least as early-as the summer of 1977 to other projects within the contractor's organization. Furthermore, failures of slip <b>ring</b> <b>assemblies</b> due to shorting between brushes had been experienced by the prime contractor on slip <b>ring</b> <b>assemblies</b> used by other programs.

40|$|In {{budding yeast}} {{the final stages}} of the cell {{division}} cycle, cytokinesis and cell separation, are distinct events that require to be coupled, both together and with mitotic exit. Here we demonstrate that mutations in genes of the mitotic exit network (MEN) prevent cell separation and are synthetically lethal in combination with both cytokinesis and septation defective mutations. Analysis of the synthetic lethal phenotypes reveals that Iqg 1 p functions in combination with the MEN components, Tem 1 p, Cdc 15 p Dbf 20 p and Dbf 2 p to govern the re-polarization of the actin cytoskeleton to either side of the bud neck. In addition phosphorylation of the conserved PCH protein, Hof 1 p, is dependent upon these activities and requires actin <b>ring</b> <b>assembly.</b> Recruitment of Dbf 2 p to the bud neck is dependent upon actin <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> and correlates with Hof 1 p phosphorylation.

40|$|SummaryFor {{successful}} cell division, cytokinesis must {{be properly}} timed to occur {{only after the}} segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, contractile <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> initiates {{at the onset of}} mitosis, and ring contraction occurs concomitant with septation at the end of anaphase. Although many of the conserved factors necessary for <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> and regulation of cytokinesis have been characterized [1, 2], still little is known about cell-cycle regulation of events that initiate cytokinesis. The formin cdc 12 p is an essential ring component with a well-characterized function in F-actin assembly [3 – 6]. Here we show that overexpression of a cdc 12 p fragment bypasses normal cell-cycle controls and induces contractile <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> and sometimes even ring contraction and septation, all during interphase. Activation of cytokinesis occurs without the apparent activation of cell-cycle regulators such as polo kinase or the septation initiation network [7]. For this effect, cdc 12 p contributes at least two separable activities: actin assembly and one or more additional functions in cytokinesis initiation. These observations suggest that the formin cdc 12 p participates downstream of cell-cycle regulators in a network that drives the initiation of cytokinesis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring fission yeast cytokinesis, actin {{filaments}} nucleated by cortical formin Cdc 12 {{are captured}} by myosin motors bound to {{a band of}} cortical nodes and bundled by cross-linking proteins. The myosin motors exert forces on the actin filaments, resulting in a net pulling of the nodes into a contractile ring, while cross-linking interactions help align actin filaments and nodes into a single bundle. We used these mechanisms in a three-dimensional computational model of contractile <b>ring</b> <b>assembly,</b> with semiflexible actin filaments growing from formins at cortical nodes, capturing of filaments by neighboring nodes, and cross-linking among filaments through attractive interactions. The model was used to predict profiles of actin filament density at the cell cortex, morphologies of condensing node-filament networks, and regimes of cortical tension by varying the node pulling force and strength of cross-linking among actin filaments. Results show that cross-linking interactions can lead to confinement of actin filaments at the simulated cortical boundary. We show that the ring-formation region in parameter space lies close to regions leading to clumps, meshworks or double rings, and stars/cables. Since boundaries between regions are not sharp, transient structures that resemble clumps, stars, and meshworks can appear {{in the process of}} <b>ring</b> <b>assembly.</b> These results are consistent with prior experiments with mutations in actin-filament turnover regulators, myosin motor activity, and changes in the concentration of cross-linkers that alter the morphology of the condensing network. Transient star shapes appear in some simulations, and these morphologies offer an explanation for star structures observed in prior experimental images. Finally, we quantify tension along actin filaments and forces on nodes during <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> and show that the mechanisms describing <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> can also drive ring constriction once the ring is formed...|$|R
40|$|The Hof 1 protein (Homologue of Fifteen) regulates {{formation}} of the primary septum during cytokinesis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas the orthologous Cdc 15 protein in fission yeast regulates the actomyosin ring by using its F-BAR domain to recruit actin nucleators to the cleavage site. Here we show that budding yeast Hof 1 also contributes to actin <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> in parallel with the Rvs 167 protein. Simultaneous deletion of the HOF 1 and RVS 167 genes is lethal, and cells fail to assemble the actomyosin ring as they progress through mitosis. Although Hof 1 and Rvs 167 are not orthologues, they both share an analogous structure, with an F-BAR or BAR domain at the amino terminus, capable of inducing membrane curvature, and SH 3 domains at the carboxyl terminus that bind to specific proline-rich targets. The SH 3 domain of Rvs 167 becomes essential for assembly of the actomyosin ring in cells lacking Hof 1, suggesting that it helps to recruit a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. This new function of Rvs 167 appears to be independent of its known role as a regulator of the Arp 2 / 3 actin nucleator, as actin <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> is not abolished by the simultaneous inactivation of Hof 1 and Arp 2 / 3. Instead we find that recruitment to the bud-neck of the Iqg 1 actin regulator is defective in cells lacking Hof 1 and Rvs 167, though future studies {{will be needed to}} determine if this reflects a direct interaction between these factors. The redundant role of Hof 1 in actin <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> suggests that the mechanism of actin <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> has been conserved to a greater extent across evolution than anticipated previously...|$|R

In the mutant strain, proteins entered mitochondria from the cytosol normally but then misfolded and aggregated.
