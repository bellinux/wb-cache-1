5|$|In 1793, {{following}} {{a survey of}} coastal defences in the southeast, approval was given for the positioning of infantry and artillery to defend the bay between Beachy Head and Hastings from attack by the French. Fourteen Martello Towers were constructed along the western shore of Pevensey Bay, continuing as far as Tower73, the Wish Tower at Eastbourne. Several of these towers survive: the Wish Tower is an important feature of the town's seafront and {{was the subject of}} <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>by</b> James Sant RA, and part of Tower68 forms the basement of a house on St.Antony's Hill. Between 1805 and 1807, the construction took place of a fortress known as the Eastbourne Redoubt, which was built as a barracks and storage depot, and armed with 10cannons.|$|E

5|$|Inside, {{the main}} room is a conference room {{on the main floor}} that {{includes}} a large projection system {{that can be used for}} remote feeds, such as from the state capitol across the street. <b>A</b> <b>painting</b> <b>by</b> John Fery is displayed over the fireplace, which the fireplace was part of the original structure in the conference room.

Artwork owned by the university's Hallie Ford Museum of Art is displayed in this area. The main floor of the three-story building is the second floor, which rests atop the look-out basement. A small meeting room is located above a small portion of the main floor.|$|E
5|$|Symphony in White, No. 3, is <b>a</b> <b>{{painting}}</b> <b>by</b> James Abbott McNeill Whistler. The work shows {{two women}} dressed in white, one {{sitting on a}} sofa and the other resting on the floor. The model on the sofa is Joanna Heffernan, the artist's mistress. By calling the painting Symphony in White, No. 3, Whistler intended to emphasise his artistic philosophy of corresponding arts, inspired by the poet Charles Baudelaire. The presence of a fan on the floor shows the influence of Japonisme, which was a popular artistic trend in European art at the time. Whistler was also greatly influenced by his colleague and friend Albert Joseph Moore, and their works show considerable similarities.|$|E
5|$|The {{album cover}} {{consists}} of <b>a</b> <b>painting</b> <b>by</b> American artist Bob Gill in which, as in Massot's film, two contrasting worlds {{are separated by}} a wall, with only a small gap allowing visual access between them. Harrison omitted his name {{from the list of}} performing musicians, leading to an assumption that he had merely produced and arranged the music. The 2014 reissue of Wonderwall Music recognises his contributions on keyboards and guitar. The album was first remastered for CD release in 1992, for which former Apple executive Derek Taylor supplied a liner-note essay.|$|E
