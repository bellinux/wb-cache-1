5|$|In 1791, Jacques-Joseph Saint-Martin, an agronomist from Limoges, {{acknowledged}} {{the importance of}} Limousin cattle in the markets of cities such as Paris, Lyon and Toulouse. Limousin cattle <b>actually</b> <b>came</b> from the departments of Charente, Dordogne, Haute-Vienne, Vienne, Lot, Corrèze and Creuse. The market for Limousin cattle declined slightly in the early 19th century, but livestock still remained a major activity in the region.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 Northern Irish poet Paul Muldoon {{published}} his long poem Madoc: a Mystery, inspired by Southey's {{work and the}} events surrounding it. Muldoon's work takes as its premise the idea that Southey and Coleridge <b>actually</b> <b>came</b> to America to found their ideal state, and offers a multi-layered poetic exploration {{of what might have}} happened. It won the 1992 Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize.|$|E

5|$|British {{ichthyologist}} Charles Tate Regan {{described the}} tiger catshark in a 1904 {{issue of the}} scientific journal Annals and Magazine of Natural History, based on two specimens presented to the British Museum by J. F. Queckett. He placed the species in the genus Scyllium (a synonym of Scyliorhinus) and gave it the specific epithet , because the type specimens were reportedly collected off the Natal coast of South Africa (though there is suspicion that they were mislabelled and <b>actually</b> <b>came</b> from Algoa Bay). Later authors reassigned this species to the genus Halaelurus. The lined catshark (Halaelurus lineatus) was once treated as conspecific to the tiger catshark, until it {{was described as a}} separate species in 1975.|$|E
5|$|David Wallace {{comes to}} the Scranton branch and says that the client was so pleased with the {{discount}} that they {{decided to make the}} company their exclusive provider of office supplies. Grateful, David congratulates Dwight for the idea and after a moment's hesitation, Dwight accepts the credit. Michael is shocked and upset. The rest of the office, still angry at Michael for his near-disastrous idea, play along with Wallace's misunderstanding and congratulate Dwight. When David sets up a conference call with the marketing department so Dwight can explain his Golden Ticket promotion, Michael interrupts and goads Dwight into revealing the idea <b>actually</b> <b>came</b> from Michael. After much bickering between Michael and Dwight, a frustrated David leaves the office, appearing indifferent about the outcome.|$|E
5|$|In his 1905 paper naming Albertosaurus, Osborn {{described}} {{two additional}} tyrannosaur specimens {{that had been}} collected from in Montana and Wyoming during a 1902 expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, led by Barnum Brown. Initially, Osborn considered these to be distinct species. The first, he named Dynamosaurus imperiosus ("emperor power lizard"), and the second, Tyrannosaurus rex ("king tyrant lizard"). A year later, Osborn recognized that these two specimens <b>actually</b> <b>came</b> from the same species. Despite the fact that Dynamosaurus had been found first, the name Tyrannosaurus had appeared one page earlier in his original article describing both specimens. Therefore, according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the name Tyrannosaurus was used.|$|E

She secured the Miss Universe 1974 pageant in Manila, which required {{the construction of the}} Folk Arts Theater in less than three months. She organized the Kasaysayan ng Lahi, a festival showcasing Philippine history. She also initiated social programs, such as the Green Revolution, which was intended to address hunger by encouraging the people to plant produce in household gardens, and created a national family-planning program. In 1972 she took control of the distribution of a bread ration called Nutribun, which <b>actually</b> <b>came</b> from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).|$|E
5|$|Political {{opposition}} in Congress {{also made it}} difficult to build the Pennsylvania-class. The House of Representatives refused to fund any new battleships for the fiscal year 1913, though the Senate would fund two in its comparable bill. They eventually compromised on one, and the battleship that would become Pennsylvania was authorized on 22 August 1912. The ship's plans were given to prospective builders on 20 December; bids were opened on 18 February 1913; and the contract was awarded to the lowest bidder, Newport News, on 27 February 1913 at the quoted price of $7,260,000 without armor or armament. The independent bidding process led the navy to claim $750,000 in savings, but the final cost <b>actually</b> <b>came</b> in at $7,800,000 ($15,000,000 with armor and armament).|$|E
5|$|The west door, {{actually}} in {{the south side of}} the church, is an elegant ornamented Decorated Gothic pointed arch, traditionally said to have come from Strata Florida Abbey. Whether it <b>actually</b> <b>came</b> from the Abbey is uncertain. A more probable date is thirteenth century, given its syle. Strata Florida Abbey was founded in 1164 and was consecrated in 1201. The arch is exceptionally ornate, indeed the finest such work in the county. It has three deeply moulded shafts each triple-roll with keel to centre roll and stiff-leaf capitals and matching triple mouldings to the pointed arch, with hoodmould. There is no evidence, archaeological or documentary, that it came from Strata Florida, or indeed anywhere else.|$|E

25|$|The {{incomplete}} form {{in which}} the Satyricon survives has tantalized many readers, and between 1692 and the present several writers have attempted to round the story out.

Owing to their militaristic background and common Akan language, Coromantins organized dozens of slave rebellions in Jamaica and elsewhere in the Caribbean. Their fierce, rebellious nature became so notorious among white plantation owners in the 18th century that an Act was proposed to ban the importation of people from the Gold Coast, despite their reputation as strong workers.|$|E
