5|$|Eight months later, as {{the city}} is besieged by the Union Army in the Atlanta Campaign, Scarlett and her young house servant Prissy must deliver Melanie's baby without medical {{assistance}} after she goes into premature labor. Afterwards, Scarlett calls upon Rhett {{to take her home}} to Tara with Melanie, her baby, and Prissy; he collects them in a horse and wagon, but once out of the city chooses to go off to fight, leaving Scarlett and the group to make their own way back to Tara. Upon her return home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters, and two former slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of typhoid fever and her father has become incompetent. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> survival of her family and herself.|$|E
5|$|In October 2009, Mike Ashley {{announced}} {{that he planned to}} lease the name of the ground in a bid to increase revenue, and in November the stadium was temporarily renamed sportsdirect.com @ St James' Park Stadium. This name was only supposed to be used {{until the end of the}} 2009–10 season, but lasted until November 2011. On 10 November 2011, the club officially changed the name of the stadium to the Sports Direct Arena, although this will most likely be an interim name, as it is only being used to showcase the sponsorship capabilities of the stadium. The company, owned by Ashley, were not paying <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> deal. However, if another company purchases the naming rights, they will be expected to pay between £8 million and £10 million. Many fans voiced their anger at the renaming, but Managing Director Derek Llambias has said that it was necessary to give Newcastle extra money so that they compete with the bigger clubs in the league.|$|E

However, his willingness to do <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> exiled prince, quickly gained Blacas the trust and confidence of his royal master. In 1809, Blacas was made the pretender's grandmaster of the wardrobe (grand-maître de la Garde-Robe du Roi). After the death of the Comte d'Avaray in 1811, he became Provence's closest advisor and favorite.|$|E
25|$|For Daly, by 1879 {{the time}} for action was right. He was expressing impatience in the Connaught Telegraph with {{achieving}} <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tenants, either through constitutional means or John Devoy's 'New Departure' (an 'unholy alliance' between pragmatic Fenians prepared to delay their resort to force, and radical Home Rulers). Delay could mean desperate men resorting to another failed uprising which he abhorred. Parnell was positioning himself {{to take over the}} Home Rule League after Isaac Butt died, and a growing land campaign would give him an issue for the coming election. Daly was not a Fenian but was prepared to accept any meaningful assistance short of violence from them. The current climate of the New Departure offered a perhaps short-lived opportunity to combine Fenian mass mobilisation and muscle, with activism within the constitutional system provided by Parnell and O'Connor Power, with Michael Davitt the key man in both camps.|$|E

25|$|By day four, the {{battered}} division {{was too weak}} to make any attempt to reach the bridge. Of the nine infantry battalions, only the 1st Battalion, Border Regiment, still existed as a unit; the others were just remnants and battalions in name only. The division, unable to do <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Battalion at the bridge, dug in, forming a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek with its base on the river. The remnants of the 10th and 156th battalions at Wolfheze began to fall back, but several elements were surrounded and captured. Some 150 men of 156th Battalion were pinned down just west of the Oosterbeek. These men broke out in the late afternoon, with 90 of them making it into the perimeter. At the bridge, Lieutenant Colonel Frost finally made radio contact with the division and was told that reinforcement was doubtful. Shortly afterwards, Frost was injured by a mortar bomb, and command passed to Major Frederick Gough. Gough arranged a two-hour truce to evacuate his wounded (including Frost), who were taken into captivity. That night, some units managed to hold out for a while and several tried to break out towards Oosterbeek, but by 05:00 on day five, all resistance at the bridge had ceased.|$|E

500|$|When the Spanish {{conquered the}} Petén lakes in 1697, the Yalain were {{initially}} cooperative and {{assisted in the}} capture of {{the king of the}} Itza. At this time Yalain was ruled by Chamach Xulu. The Yalain leadership encouraged Christian conversion as a means of maintaining peace with the occupying Spanish forces. As time went on, Yalain cooperation with the Spanish appears to have decreased. Soon after the conquest, the Yalain fled their settlements to avoid foraging Spanish parties that were abducting Maya women for [...] "service" [...] at their barracks. At this time, such was the hostility that was felt towards the occupying forces that the inhabitants of the Yalain settlements preferred to burn their fields and break all their pottery rather than leave <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Spanish. The Yalain capital is recorded as having been burned in 1698.|$|E

500|$|From late 2010 {{until his}} death in May 2013, Jeff Hanneman's {{participation}} in Slayer was minimal. In January 2011, he contracted necrotizing fasciitis, which severely restricted his ability to perform. He appeared publicly with the band on only one known occasion, playing two songs during an encore at one of Slayer's Big 4 performances in April 2011; he also attended rehearsals for Fun Fun Fun Fest in November 2011, but did not end up performing at this show. By July 2012, Hanneman had not written or recorded any new material for the band's follow up to 2009's World Painted Blood. In February 2013, Kerry King stated he was planning on recording all of the guitar parts for the upcoming album himself, but was open to Hanneman's return if he was willing and able. King also denied that Gary Holt, member of Exodus and Hanneman's live fill-in, would write or record <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> upcoming album. Hanneman died on May 2, 2013 at the age of 49 due to liver failure.|$|E
500|$|Inglis was {{involved}} with the Cambridge University Officer Training Corps (CUOTC), being commissioned a second lieutenant on 24 May 1909. [...] He served with the CUOTC's engineering detachment and noticed that when the unit was deployed on field days {{with the rest of}} the force it often had little to do. To remedy this, Inglis designed a reusable steel bridge, with the intention that it could be erected and dismantled by the unit in a single afternoon. [...] An army general who was inspecting the unit noticed his design and offered advice: [...] "If you're making <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> army, keep it simple– no complicated gadgets". [...] Upon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Inglis volunteered for active service in the British Army and was officially listed as an Assistant Instructor in the School of Military Engineering, with the temporary rank of lieutenant. [...] The army expressed interest in Inglis' bridge design; it was approved for use by a panel of army officers that included the general who had first commented on the design, to whom Inglis said [...] "I hope, Sir, you will find I have profited by your advice". [...] The design remained in service with the British Army until the higher-capacity Bailey bridge was introduced during the Second World War.|$|E
500|$|Many of Kavner's roles {{have been}} {{described}} by New York Times writer Hilary de Vries as a [...] "woman who is supportive, sympathetic, or self-effacingly funny". Kavner grew to despise playing such roles, saying, [...] "If it smacks of Brenda Morgenstern, I won't take the job." [...] She had a supporting role as Eleanor Costello, a nurse who befriends Robin Williams' character in the Academy Award nominated film Awakenings. Kavner interviewed several nurses {{in preparation for the}} role, and Penny Marshall, the director of the film, described Kavner as [...] "a low-maintenance actor [...] You {{never have to worry about}} giving [...] back-story for her characters." [...] In 1992, Kavner starred in This Is My Life, her first leading role in a feature film. Kavner played Dottie Ingels, an aspiring stand-up comedian who starts neglecting her family when her career begins to take off. Kavner described Dottie as [...] "really selfish" [...] but admitted, [...] "I liked the role for that very reason." [...] Kavner had been asked to play a character with a smaller role in the film, but Joe Roth, at the time the chairman of 20th Century Fox, suggested that they cast a lesser known actress in the lead role. Nora Ephron, the writer of This Is My Life, said Kavner [...] "has so little vanity that it is almost shocking. Not only does she have no demands as an actress - 'How big is my trailer, what's in my refrigerator?' - but she will do <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> character if it makes sense to her." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{was written}} by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Michael Marcantel. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April7, 2002. The idea for the episode was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer, who wanted to make an episode in which Homer becomes addicted to medicinal marijuana. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean thought that the premise sounded [...] "very funny" [...] and assigned Vitti to write the episode's first draft. Vitti wrote the script at his home and {{did not participate in}} any rewriting sessions with the other staff writers. [...] " [...] it's a funny bunch of people", he said in the episode's DVD commentary. [...] "You definitely lose touch with what the movies you're supposed to see, what's good on TV..." [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] is the second episode Vitti wrote in which a character forgets to vote at an election, and the second episode he wrote in which Homer takes a chemical that causes him to be promoted by Burns and run into conflict with Smithers. [...] "You can't do <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time at this point", Vitti quipped. Producer and former showrunner Mike Reiss has stated that he thoroughly enjoyed working on [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's". [...] "I gotta say, this was the most fun I ever had working on an episode", he said in the episode's DVD commentary. [...] "Everyone but me had stories to tell [...] There would be about four hours of recollection before any rewriting happened." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2016, Kerry King {{was asked}} if Slayer will release a {{follow-up}} to Repentless. He replied, [...] "We've got lots of leftover material from the last album, 'cause we wrote so much stuff, and we recorded a bunch of it too. If the lyrics don't change the song musically, those songs are done. So we are {{way ahead of the}} ballgame without even doing <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next record. And I've been working on stuff on my downtime. Like, I'll warm up and a riff will come to mind and I'll record it. I've gotten a handful of those on this run. So wheels are still turning. I haven't worked on anything lyrically yet except for what was done on the last record, so that's something I've gotta get on. But, yeah, Repentless isn't quite a year old yet." [...] King also stated that Slayer is not expected to enter the studio until at least 2018. In an October interview on Hatebreed frontman Jamey Jasta's podcast, King stated that he is [...] "completely open" [...] to having guitarist Gary Holt (who had no songwriting contributions on Repentless) involved in the songwriting process of the next Slayer album. He explained, [...] "I'm entirely open to having Gary work on something. I know he's gotta work on an Exodus record and I've got tons already for this one. But, you know, if he's gonna stick around... I didn't want it on the last one, and I knew that. I'm completely open to having that conversation. I haven't talked to Tom about it, I haven't talked to Gary open about it, but I'm open. That's not saying it is or isn't gonna happen. But my ears are open." ...|$|E
500|$|When Liszt {{started writing}} symphonic poems, [...] "he {{had very little}} {{experience}} in handling an orchestra ... {{his knowledge of the}} technique of instrumentation was defective and he had as yet composed hardly <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> orchestra." [...] For these reasons he relied first on his assistants August Conradi and Joachim Raff to fill the gaps in his knowledge and find his [...] "orchestral voice". Raff, [...] "a gifted composer with an imaginative grasp of the orchestra", offered close assistance to Liszt. Also helpful were the virtuosi present at that time in the Weimarian Court orchestra, such as trombonist Moritz Nabich, harpist Jeanne Pohl, concertmaster Joseph Joachim and violinist Edmund Singer. [...] " [...] mixed daily with these musicians, and their discussions must have been filled with 'shop talk.'" [...] Both Singer and cellist Bernhard Cossmann were widely experienced orchestral players who probably knew the different instrumental effects a string section could produceknowledge that Liszt would have found invaluable, and about which he might have had many discussions with the two men. With such a range of talent from which to learn, Liszt may have actually mastered orchestration reasonably quickly. By 1853, he felt he no longer needed Raff's assistance and their professional association ended in 1856. Also, in 1854 Liszt received a specially designed instrument called a [...] "piano-organ" [...] from the firm of Alexandre and fils in Paris. This huge instrument, a combination of piano and organ, was basically a one-piece orchestra that contained three keyboards, eight registers, a pedal board and a set of pipes that reproduced the sounds of all the wind instruments. With it, Liszt could try out various instrumental combinations at his leisure as a further aid for his orchestration.|$|E
