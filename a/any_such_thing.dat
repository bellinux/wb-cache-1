5|$|Louisville {{returned}} on offense, {{needing to}} score quickly, make {{a stop on}} defense, then score a second {{time to take the}} lead. The energized Tech defense was disinclined to allow <b>any</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing.</b> Though Cantwell completed two short passes for 16yards and a first down, he was sacked on first down and the Tech defense prevented him from completing another pass. Two passes were knocked down by Hokie defenders, while another fell short. After Louisville failed to convert a fourth down, Virginia Tech took over on offense. The Hokies proceeded to run out the clock, executing two short rushes and an incomplete pass. Louisville had one final chance on offense after a Tech punt, but three consecutive desperation Hail Mary passes were unsuccessful. Two fell incomplete, and the third was intercepted by Tech cornerback Brandon Flowers. With time almost gone, Tech finished running out the clock and secured the victory. As time expired, Virginia Tech held a 35–24 lead and won the 2006 Gator Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from his {{director and the}} exhibit's drug manufacturer sponsor, Burton steals Zero's medical records in hopes of discovering new information. Zero and Burton examine an old blood sample of Zero's under a microscope and discover Miss HIV (Michael Callen), who {{points out that the}} original study that was used to label Patient Zero as the first person to bring HIV to North America did not prove <b>any</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing,</b> but instead helped prove that HIV was sexually transmitted, leading to the development of safer sex practices. Under this interpretation, Zero could be lauded as a hero for his candor in participating in that original study. As Burton ponders this, an unknown fluid squirts from the eye pieces of the microscope, drenching Zero and making him appear on video. He joyously declares his innocence on tape but the effect only lasts five minutes before he fades away again. Zero angrily accuses Burton of not caring for him at all and only wanting to use him for the exhibit, then storms out.|$|E

In contrast, Einstein denied that there is any background Euclidean reference frame that extends throughout space.

500|$|Starting on September 23 and {{continuing}} {{for over three}} weeks, each of the accused men {{was brought to the}} witness stand to testify in his defense. The general trend of the men's responses was that all of them were willing to obey any order except to load ammunition, all were afraid of another explosion, and none had been approached by [...] "ringleaders" [...] persuading them not to workeach had made his own decision. Each man said that he himself had not coerced others to refuse to work. Some of the men related how, following the official interrogation at Camp Shoemaker, they had been under great pressure to sign statements containing things they had not said. Some men said that, at the meeting on the barge, Joe Small had not urged a mutiny and had not uttered any phrase to the effect of having the officers [...] "by the balls".

500|$|Garnet {{was not at}} {{all like}} Catesby, {{described}} by Fraser as possessing the mentality [...] "of the crusader who does not hesitate to employ the sword in the cause of values which he considers are spiritual". In contrast, Garnet believed that [...] "things were best settled by submission to the will of God." [...] He was ebullient over King James's succession to the English throne, and hoped there would be no foreign interference. Of the 1603 Bye Plot, revealed (with his blessing) to the Privy Council by two Catholic priests, he wrote that it was [...] "a piece of impudent folly, for we know that it is by peaceful means that his Holiness and other princes are prepared to help us." [...] He exhorted that Pope Clement VIII instruct all English Catholics not to engage in violent rebellion, [...] "quiete et pacifice". [...] It was a message echoed by Archpriest George Blackwell, who commanded his priests never to attempt <b>any</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing,</b> but it proved controversial; early in summer 1605 Garnet reported to Rome that English Catholics had reached [...] "a stage of desperation".|$|E

2500|$|In 1931, Carnap was {{appointed}} Professor at the German language University of Prague. There {{he wrote the}} book that was to make him the most famous logical positivist {{and member of the}} Vienna Circle, his Logical Syntax of Language (Carnap 1934). In this work, Carnap advanced his Principle of Tolerance, according to which there is not <b>any</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as a [...] "true" [...] or [...] "correct" [...] logic or language. One is free to adopt whatever form of language is useful for one's purposes. In 1933, W. V. Quine met Carnap in Prague and discussed the latter's work at some length. Thus began the lifelong mutual respect these two men shared, one that survived Quine's eventual forceful disagreements with a number of Carnap's philosophical conclusions.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Diarmaid Ferriter said: [...] "There'll be broad {{consensus}} {{around what}} Bertie did in Northern Ireland, the social partnership and the unity {{he brought to}} his own party. Also, he made Fianna Fáil the permanent party of government. They used {{to have all of}} the power most of the time, but now they have most of the power all of the time. All of that takes skill. But I wonder will people talk about 'Ahernism'? Is there <b>any</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing?</b> What does he actually stand for? In some ways Bertie's lack of vision was a positive, it made him flexible and willing to compromise, and he was certainly outstanding in that regard. But I dissent from the universal plaudits going around at the moment. He had no social or economic vision for the state he led. There was no fire in his belly. He didn't really want to change society for the better. He was the ward boss writ large. But at the moment it seems it's unfashionable to say anything adverse about Bertie." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Wakefield wrote Callous Disregard: Autism and Vaccines – The Truth Behind a Tragedy, {{in which}} he {{rejected}} the charges against him, and claimed {{that the loss of}} his license was a political attempt to silence his criticism of vaccine safety. [...] In 2013, Joel A. Harrison, PhD, MPH published a detailed examination of Callous Disregard, and concluded that [...] "a careful review of publicly available information makes it clear that ... every major claim Wakefield makes in his book concerning vaccine safety is wrong." [...] He demonstrated that in some cases, the references that Wakefield cited to support his claims showed exactly the opposite. [...] For example, Wakefield asserted that Brith Christenson, MD, PhD, a respected Swedish vaccine researcher, had told him that vaccine safety studies had not been carried out in Sweden because Swedish physicians did not concern themselves with vaccine safety; then cited three Swedish papers—two of them co-authored by Christenson—detailing multiple vaccine safety studies that had been conducted in Sweden. [...] Christenson later affirmed {{in a letter to the}} editor that she had never said <b>any</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> to anyone, and in fact had never spoken to Wakefield at all.|$|E

2500|$|Thompson went on {{to become}} a fierce critic of Nixon, both during and after his presidency. After Nixon's death in 1994, Thompson {{described}} him in Rolling Stone as a man who [...] "could shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time" [...] and said [...] "his casket [...] have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president. [...] was an evil man—evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the Devil can understand it." [...] Following Nixon's pardon by Gerald Ford in 1974, Hunter ruminated on the approximately $400,000 pension Nixon maneuvered his way into, by resigning before being formally indicted. While The Washington Post was lamenting Nixon's [...] "lonely and depressed" [...] state after being forced from the White House, Hunter wrote that 'f there were <b>any</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as true justice in this world, his [...] rancid carcass would be somewhere down around Easter Island right now, in the belly of a hammerhead shark.'

2500|$|On 25 July 2007, Rasmussen won stage 16 of the 2007 Tour de France. [...] He had led {{the general}} {{classification}} (overall lead) since winning Stage 8, and with a lead of over three minutes over second-place Alberto Contador, he was all but assured of winning. [...] However, hours after his win, Rabobank abruptly fired him and removed him from the race. Previously, an Italian cycling commentator for RAI and former professional road bicycle racer, Davide Cassani, telling a story about Rasmussen's intense preparations for the Tour, stated he had seen Rasmussen in the Italian Dolomites on 13 June 2007, cycling in the rain. According to the schedule Rasmussen submitted to the UCI, {{he should have been}} in Mexico at that time. When confronted with this accusation, according to initial press reports, Rasmussen admitted the facts to his team leader, which resulted in Rasmussen's removal from the team and the Tour. Rasmussen himself later first denied that he had admitted <b>any</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing,</b> stating that Rabobank manager Theo de Rooij [...] "was a desperate man {{on the verge of a}} nervous breakdown," [...] but later admitted lying about his whereabouts. Two days later on 27 July Theo de Rooij announced his resignation from his position as team manager. Rasmussen's in-laws later confirmed to the Danish newspaper BT that he had visited them in Mexico, but that they did not know where exactly he had been on 13 and 14 June 2007. Rabobank backed the decision to withdraw Rasmussen but reconfirmed its commitment as a sponsor in cycling, [...] at least at the local level.|$|E

[...] The network also said, [...] "Our goal with the Super Bowl Halftime show was to produce an entertaining stage experience with a positive message about empowerment and voting. We are disappointed that this message has been overshadowed by the unfortunate incident". A statement from CBS read, [...] "We attended all rehearsals throughout the week and there was no indication that <b>any</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> would happen. The moment did not conform to CBS broadcast standards and we would like to apologize to anyone who was offended." [...] Viacom President Mel Karmazin said that while the company can be proud of 99% of what people saw on the broadcast, it understands [...] "what a difference one percent can make". NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the show produced by MTV, which like CBS, was owned by Viacom at the time (before the two networks were respectively separated into Viacom and CBS Corporation, both controlled by National Amusements, in December 2005), fell far short of the [...] "tasteful, first-class entertainment" [...] the league expected. FCC Commissioner Michael Powell, appearing before a Senate panel, called the Super Bowl incident [...] "a new low for prime time television". Joe Browne, Executive Vice President of the NFL, said, [...] "We were extremely disappointed by elements of the MTV-produced Halftime show. They were totally inconsistent with assurances our office was given about the show. It's unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime." [...] An hour-long MTV documentary titled [...] "Making the Super Bowl Halftime Show" [...] was scheduled to premiere the following week but was canceled before it ever aired and has never been broadcast subsequently.|$|E
