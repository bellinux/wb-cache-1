5|$|A {{radical change}} of tactics, which {{involved}} {{the introduction of}} a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the French colonies, was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen. It was a shrewd move, since the majority of British ships were now flying American flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war. A bill was introduced and approved by the cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, so as not to draw <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the effect of the bill. The approach proved successful, and the new Foreign Slave Trade Bill was quickly passed, and received royal assent on 23 May 1806.|$|E

The council did not read the letter nor did it pay <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the protests of Leo's legates but deposed Flavian and Eusebius of Dorylaeum, who appealed to Rome. That is one reason that the council was never recognized as ecumenical and was later repudiated by the Council of Chalcedon.|$|E
25|$|As a {{so-called}} provinciano ("provincial person", that is, an implication of backwardness regarding the social graces of urban life), Chávez was prima facie regarded by his peers as both polite and shy. However, {{by the time}} he had graduated, Chávez had emceed a beauty contest as well as taken charge of his own obscure radio program. As a young man, Chávez had two girlfriends, who were considered by other students as unattractive. Chávez too was widely considered unattractive, and these girlfriends were more interested in two of Chávez's best friends, the Ruiz brothers, than in Chávez himself. Chávez also had his share of social upsets; for example, when a young woman whom he considered attractive refused to pay <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> him, Chávez found a rotting donkey head on the side of the road and left it in front of her door. Later, Chávez found another girlfriend, Herma Marksman, who helped draft a capstone thesis required of him prior to graduation. Chávez would—after his marriage at age 23. to Nancy Colmenares— later commit adultery with Marksman. His relationship with Marksman lasted nine years.|$|E

25|$|Up to 11 policemen at a {{time had}} tried to control all this traffic, many of them {{standing}} on small wooden platforms positioned in key locations around the platz, but with varying success. The traffic lights, again from Siemens, were mounted on a five-sided 8.5 m high tower designed by Jean Kramer, shipped over from the United States, and actually modelled on a similar one erected on Fifth Avenue in New York in 1922, although towers like {{this had been a}} feature of New York since 1918. A solitary policeman sat in a small cabin {{at the top of the}} tower and switched the lights around manually, until they were eventually automated in 1926. Yet some officers still remained on the ground in case people did not pay <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the lights. The tower remained until c.1936, when it was removed to allow for excavations for the new S-Bahn line (on 26 September 1997, a replica of the tower was erected, just for show, close to its original location by Siemens, to celebrate the company's 150th anniversary. The replica was moved again on 29 September 2000, to the place where it stands today).|$|E
25|$|In his {{capacity}} as Assistant Curator at the American Museum of Natural History, Franz Boas requested that Arctic explorer Robert E. Peary bring one Inuk from Greenland to New York. Peary obliged and brought six Inuit to New York in 1897 {{who lived in}} the basement of the American Museum of Natural History. Four of them died from tuberculosis within a year of arriving in New York, with the exception of one young boy, Minik Wallace. Boas staged a funeral for the father of the boy, and instead of resting the remains in peace, Boas had the remains dissected and placed in the museum. Later Minik Wallace realized that his father's bones were kept at the museum and requested their return. Boas then no longer worked at the museum, but the museum did not want to return the bones. Minik eventually was able to return to Greenland, but Boas did not help him or pay <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the plight of the Inuit whom he had brought to New York. Boas has been widely critiqued for his role in bringing Minik and the five other Inuit to New York, and his disinterest in them once they had served their purpose at the museum.|$|E
25|$|On July 23, 1703, Gutiérrez died in San Juan. Despite his connection, Enríquez was {{generally}} {{ignored by the}} members of the elite that opposed his rule and the privateering operation continued. Gutiérrez's death brought forth a period of instability of five years, during which Puerto Rico had nine governors. This favored Enríquez, who continued to thrive in the shadows. Most of them were simply interim governors and due to their short time in office, none were able to pay <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> his growing success. When Pedro del Arroyo was sworn, Enríquez tried to buy his favor by paying the voyage. However, Arroyo died shortly afterwards, preventing a notable profit from this partnership. Despite this, Enríquez actually paid for the funeral service and even provided the black clothing for the servants. Despite his distinction, the former governor was not economically stable and his family was moved into the privateer's house. One of the late governor's sons, Laureano Pérez del Arroyo, lived with him until his adulthood, when Enríquez requested that he was promoted to the rank of captain. In time, Pérez del Arroyo would become of his most vocal enemies. Eventually, as his wealth and influence grew Enríquez inherited some of Gutiérrez's old enemies, including the high class Calderón family.|$|E

The episode, along with the Terrance and Phillip show, were inspired by early criticism that South Park was little more than flatulence jokes and primitive animation. The script portrays the parents as so invested in protesting television programs, they fail to pay <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> what is actually going on in their children's lives. They seem to want to make television clean and wholesome so the entertainment industry can raise their kids so they themselves don't have to make the time and effort to be full-time parents.

Wright saw an alternative—his family's ancestral farm near Spring Green, Wisconsin. Wright returned alone to the United States in late 1910, publicly reconciling with Kitty while working to secure money to buy land for a house for himself and Borthwick. On April3, 1911, Wright wrote to a friend requesting money to purchase [...] "a small house" [...] for his mother. By the 10th, Wright's mother Anna had a signed deed for the property. By using Anna's name, Wright was able to secure the [...] property without attracting <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the affair. Late in the summer, Mamah Borthwick (having divorced Cheney and legally reverting to her maiden name) quietly moved into the property, staying with Wright's sister at Tan-y-Deri. However, Wright and Borthwick's new property was discovered by a Chicago Examiner reporter that fall, and the affair made headlines in the Chicago Tribune on Christmas Eve.|$|E

[...] There, she was soon followed by Strindberg's letters, full of agonized remorse at having given her pain, and then by Strindberg himself, steeling himself to bear the social life Bosse relished. However, the relationship quickly foundered on jealousy and suspicion, as when Strindberg struck a photographer over the head with his stick, unable to endure <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Bosse. In August, when Bosse discovered that she was pregnant, even Strindberg's delight (he was a fond parent of the four children of his previous marriages) could not save a marriage full of distrust and accusation. [...] This was illustrated in Strindberg's increasingly frantic letters to Bosse When their daughter Anne-Marie was born on 25 March 1902, they were already living apart. [...] "For the sake of us both it is best that I do not return", wrote Bosse in a letter to Strindberg. [...] "A continuation of life together with suspicion of every word, every act of mine, would be the end of me." [...] At her insistence, Strindberg began divorce proceedings.|$|E
500|$|Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, {{commonly}} referred to as simply the Master Chief, is the main protagonist and main playable character in the Halo trilogy. The character is voiced by Steve Downes, a Chicago disc jockey. One of the last SPARTAN-II supersoldiers still in active service (one of the few survivors of the Fall of Reach), the Master Chief inspires awe and fear in the alien Covenant, who refer to him as (a) [...] "Demon". Assisted by the artificial intelligence Cortana, he prevents the firing of Installation 04 in Halo: Combat Evolved, an event which the player is told would have destroyed all sentient life in the galaxy. Bungie staff member Joseph Staten noted that until the Master Chief was created, Bungie had not paid <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> how to make people want to play in the world. [...] "Master Chief is really what kicked off the creativity," [...] he said, [...] "in terms of how people react to him. He's a space marine in really cool green armor."

By April 2002, Bartley and ÓBriain were in Caracas and spent much of their time filming at the presidential palace, following Chávez and his staff. As the 11April crisis unfolded, Bartley and ÓBriain filmed outside the palace, first capturing footage of the demonstrations and subsequent violence, then events inside the palace during the afternoon, evening and early hours of 12April. Through their previous contacts at the palace, Bartley and ÓBriain were able to continue filming without interference: [...] "no one paid <b>any</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> us—we just blended in." [...] Later that day, Bartley and ÓBriain stayed away from the palace through fears for their safety. Unable to leave the country—the international airport was closed—the filmmakers instead took to the streets, [...] "to document the repression [...] were witnessing". At the same time, a press office cameraman was in the palace, [...] "reluctant to lose his job despite the change in government". He filmed the formation of the interim government. When Bartley and ÓBriain returned to the palace on 13April, the cameraman let them have his footage.
