During commodity transfer at CCAFS and KSC, wet chemical scrubbers (typically containing four <b>scrubbing</b> <b>towers)</b> are used to neutralize fuel saturated vapors from vent systems on tanks and tanker trailers. For fuel vapors, a citric acid solution is used to scrub {{out most of the}} hydrazine. Operation of both the hypergolic fuel and oxidizer vapor scrubbers generates waste scrubber liquor. Currently, scrubber liquor from the fuel vapor scrubber is considered non-hazardous. The scrubber liquor is defined as spent citric acid scrubber solution; the solution contains complexed hydrazine I methylhydrazine and is used to neutralize nonspecification hypergolic fuel generated by CCAFS and KSC.

The {{purpose of the}} flowsheet development studies was to test and develop the baseline TRUEX flowsheet for ICPP SEW under continuous, countercurrent conditions using centrifugal contactors. All testing was performed using non-radioactive SEW simulant. Potential flowsheets were evaluated {{with regards to the}} behavior of the non-radioactive components known to be extracted by the TRUEX solvent. In general, the behavior of the individual components closely paralleled that anticipated from batch testing. The results indicate that eight extraction stages are more than sufficient to reduce the actinide content in the SEW to levels well below the NRC Class A LLW criteria of 10 nCi/g. Iron was effectively scrubbed from the organic and 5 % ended up in the high-activity waste (HAW) fraction. Zirconium scrubbing was not as effective and as much as 60 % of the Zr in the feed could end up in the HAW fraction.

40|$|Molten salt {{oxidation}} (MSO) is {{a thermal}} {{process that has}} the capability of destroying organic constituents of mixed wastes, hazardous wastes, and energetic materials. In this process, combustible waste and air are introduced into the molten sodium carbonate salt. The organic constituents of the waste materials are oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, {{while most of the}} inorganic constituents, including toxic metals, minerals, and radioisotopes, are retained in the molten salt bath. As these impurities accumulate in the salt, the process efficiency drops and the salt must be replaced. An efficient process is needed to separate these toxic metals, minerals, and radioisotopes from the spent carbonate to avoid generating a large volume of secondary waste. Toxic metals such as cadmium, chromium, lead, and zinc etc. are removed by a method described elsewhere. This paper describes a separation strategy developed for radioisotope removal from the mixed spent salt, as well as experimental results, as part of the spent salt cleanup. As the MSO system operates, inorganic products resulting from the reaction of halides, sulfides, phosphates, metals and radionuclides with carbonate accumulate in the salt bath. These must be removed to prevent complete conversion of the sodium carbonate, which would result in eventual losses of destruction efficiency and <b>acid</b> <b>scrubbing</b> capability. There are two operational modes for salt removal: (1) during reactor operation a slip-stream of molten salt is continuously withdrawn with continuous replacement by carbonate, or (2) the spent salt melt is discharged completely and the reactor then refilled with carbonate in batch mode. Because many of the metals and/or radionuclides captured in the salt are hazardous and/or radioactive, spent salt removed from the reactor would create a large secondary waste stream without further treatment. A spent salt clean up/recovery system is necessary to segregate these materials and minimize the amount of secondary waste. These materials can then be encapsulated for final disposal...|$|R

In {{recognition}} {{to the need to}} reduced CO 2 emission from coal or fuel fired power plant, research project on an engineering system for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in ocean space utilisation is proposed in the collegium. This book is written to address the engineering challenges in our proposed CCS engineering system. It is recognised that the public perception is the main key to successful CCS project and an engineering system that involves public engagement in the CCS project in the early stage is proposed. The proposed project is known as the “Green Town” where it comprises of an air <b>scrubbing</b> <b>towers</b> that has the ability to capture CO 2 from the air. The selected site for the case study would then be free of anthropogenic CO 2. The captured CO 2 will then be transported by pipelines and stored in depleted oil/gas field for a geological time scale. Hamburg in Germany is selected as the case study city since it is a port city and is close to available geological formations for CO 2 storage. The K 12 -B gas field has also been identified as the proposed sequestration site. The CO 2 pipelines will tie-in to existing gas pipelines when they are no longer in use in the near future and the CO 2 injection system for the CO 2 will be retrofitted to gas platform when the gas field is no longer in use. The cost, risk and legal issues for the proposed “Green Town” idea are also addressed as well. This project also designed and conducted specific surveys in Southampton and Hamburg to investigate the public perception towards the “Green Town” idea and CCS. Unique findings are found and presented in this book. This book makes an important contribution in addressing the need to engage the public at the early stage of the CCS project. The designed surveys successfully proved that the proposed “Green Town” idea could act as an effective ‘door opener’ to future CCS project. We hope that this book would be useful to engineers and scientists working on the areas of CCS and are looking forward to share our views on the unique findings about the public’s perception of CCS...|$|R

40|$|When uranium {{is used as}} fuel {{in nuclear}} {{reactors}} it both undergoes neutron induced fission as well as neutron capture. Through successive neutron capture and beta decay transuranic elements such as neptunium, plutonium, americium and curium are produced in substantial amounts. These radioactive elements are mostly long-lived and contribute to {{a large portion of}} the long term radiotoxicity of the used nuclear fuel. This radiotoxicity is what makes it necessary to isolate the used fuel for more than 100 000 years in a final repository in order to avoid harm to the biosphere. To diminish this long-term radiotoxicity of the waste, to further increase the energy utilization and to decrease the heat load of the final repository there is an advanced reprocessing option called Partitioning and Transmutation (P&T). Within P&T the transuranic elements are separated from the fission products in the used fuel and transmuted using a fast neutron spectrum. During transmutation these long lived elements are transformed to short lived or even stable ones. The partitioning for transmutation can be realised using liquid-liquid extraction. Within this work a liquid-liquid extraction process of GANEX type has been developed and studied. The GANEX (Group ActiNide EXtraction) concept consists of two cycles; a first cycle where the uranium bulk is removed from the fuel dissolution liquor and a second cycle (the actual GANEX extraction) where the transuranic elements as well as residual uranium are extracted together as a group. Here, only the second cycle has been studied. The GANEX solvent developed comprises of the extractants CyMe 4 -BTBP and TBP in cyclohexanone. This solvent composition was found to be able to efficiently extract the actinides as a group from nitric acid. The actinides could also be separated from most of the fission products (including the trivalent lanthanides) with high separation factors. The few co-extracted fission products could to a large extent be managed by the addition of water soluble suppressing agents and scrubbing reagents. The solvent was found to be stable towards both hydrolysis as well as γ-radiolysis in the presence of nitric acid. The process was also shown to work under fission product loading conditions and after <b>acid</b> <b>scrubbing</b> of the solvent the actinides could be recovered as group.
