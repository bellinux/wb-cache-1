5|$|As {{the game}} {{began to spread}} to Europe and beyond, clubs adopted kits similar to those worn in the United Kingdom, {{and in some cases}} chose colours {{directly}} inspired by British clubs. In 1903, Juventus of Italy adopted <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> strip inspired by Notts County. Two years later, Argentina's Club Atlético Independiente adopted red shirts after watching Nottingham Forest play.|$|E

5|$|One {{prevailing}} {{idea is that}} carnivory {{in plants}} is not <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> duality, but rather a spectrum from strict non-carnivorous photoautotrophs (a rose, for example) to fully carnivorous plants with active trapping mechanisms like those of Dionaea or Aldrovanda. However, passive traps are still considered fully carnivorous. Plants that fall between the definitions in the strict carnivorous/non-carnivorous demarcation {{can be defined as}} being protocarnivorous.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} compliance {{model is}} a regulatory framework or model known as dualistic, where the regulator reacts to an entity's behaviours {{depending on whether the}} behaviour is seen as either right or wrong.

5|$|The colours {{used by the}} {{original}} Panthers were black and white. Home shirts were black with <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> striped lining on the shoulders. When the club reformed in 1980, {{the black and white}} colours were also revived, with a gold lining also being added to the jerseys. In 1996 red was added to the colour scheme of the shirts. In 2001–02 the club's colour scheme was changed to black and gold. Home jerseys are gold with a black lining with away jerseys being the reverse. In 2007–08, the Panthers brought out a predominantly white third jersey for the Challenge Cup.|$|E
5|$|A {{narrative}} rational for {{the concept}} of Hell {{can be found in}} the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. This narrative ends with Yudhishthira's visit to hell after being offered acceptance into heaven. This journey creates a scene for the audience that helps illustrate the importance of understanding hell as well as heaven before accepting either extreme. This idea provides an essential lesson regarding Dharma, a primary theme within the Mahabharata. Dharma is not <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> concept, and all people are not entirely good or entirely evil. As such, tolerance is essential in order to truly understand the “right way of living”. We all must understand the worst to truly understand and appreciate the best just as we must experience the best before we can experience the worst. This narrative utilizes the Hindu religion in order to teach lessons on tolerance and acceptance of one another's faults as well as virtues.|$|E
5|$|Clergy of the Church of England {{who were}} not bishops {{historically}} bore arms identical to a layman, with a shield, helm and crest, and no ecclesiastical hat. In England in 1976 a system for deans, archdeacons and canons was authorized by the College of Arms, allowing a black ecclesiastical hat, black or violet cords, and three violet or red tassels on each side. A priest uses <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> cord with a single tassel on each side, and a deacon a hat without tassels. A Doctor of Divinity may have cords interwoven with red and a hat appropriate to the degree, {{and members of the}} Ecclesiastical Household add a Tudor rose {{on the front of the}} hat. According to Boutell's Heraldry, this system represents the practice of the Church in England in the 16th century.|$|E

5|$|Nostalgia for old Hollywood movies {{would be}} a theme of Donen's next film: Movie Movie, {{produced}} by Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment and scripted by Larry Gelbart and Sheldon Keller. The film is actually two shorter films presented as an old fashioned double feature, complete with a fake movie trailer and an introduction by comedian George Burns. It starred George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, Red Buttons, Michael Kidd and Eli Wallach and premiered in competition at the 29th Berlin International Film Festival in 1978. The first of the two films is Dynamite Hands, <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> tribute to boxing – morality films. The second film is Baxter's Beauties of 1933, {{a tribute to the}} extravagant musicals of Busby Berkely. Like Donen's previous two films, it was unsuccessful both financially and critically.|$|E
5|$|Sociologist Reiner Grundmann's {{review in}} BioSocieties journal, {{acknowledges}} that the book is well researched and factually based, but criticizes the book as being written in <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> manner whereas historians should write a more nuanced description. The book depicts special interests and contrarians misleading the public as being mainly responsible for stopping action on policy. He says this shows a lack of basic understanding {{of the political process}} and the mechanisms of knowledge policy, because the authors assume that public policy would follow on from an understanding of the science. While the book provides all the (formal) hallmarks of science, Grundmann sees it less as a scholarly work than a passionate attack and overall as a problematic book.|$|E
5|$|The Casino Royale {{episode was}} lost for decades after its 1954 {{broadcast}} until <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> kinescope of the live broadcast was located by film historian Jim Schoenberger in 1981. It also aired on TBS {{as part of}} a Bond film marathon. However, the original 1954 broadcast had been in color; moreover the VHS release and TBS presentation did not include the last two minutes, which were at that point still lost. Eventually, the missing footage (minus the last seconds of the end credits) was found and included on a Spy Guise & Cara Entertainment VHS release. MGM subsequently included the incomplete version on its DVD and bluray releases of the 1967 spoof version of Casino Royale.|$|E
