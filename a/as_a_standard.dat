5|$|As Vega {{had long}} been used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> star for {{calibrating}} telescopes, the discovery that it is rapidly rotating may challenge some of the underlying assumptions that were based on it being spherically symmetric. With the viewing angle and rotation rate of Vega now better known, this will allow for improved instrument calibrations.|$|E

5|$|As in its predecessor, System Shock, {{gameplay}} in System Shock 2 is an amalgamation of {{the action}} role-playing game and survival horror genres. The developers achieved this gameplay design by rendering the experience <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> first-person shooter and adding a character customization and development system, which are considered as signature role-play elements. The player uses melee and projectile weapons to defeat enemies, while a role-playing system allows the development of useful abilities. Navigation is presented from a first-person view and complemented with a heads-up display that shows character and weapon information, a map, and a drag and drop inventory.|$|E
5|$|Data URIs: The actual {{images that}} form the eyes are encoded as data URIs, which allow {{multimedia}} to be embedded in web pages rather than stored as a separate file. Acid2 tests the most common case, where a binary image is base64-encoded into text and then that encoded text is included in a data URI in the web page. Although the IETF published the data URI specification in 1998, they never formally adopted it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard.</b> Nonetheless, the HTML 4.01 specification references the data URI scheme, and data URI support has now been implemented in most browsers.|$|E
5|$|Edmund McMillen from Team Meat, the {{developer}} of the indie game Super Meat Boy, created various accounts on PETA's official forums {{to try to}} get his game parodied by PETA. PETA developed Super Tofu Boy and released it in December 2010. It stars Tofu Boy, an anthropomorphic cube of tofu whose goal is to rescue Bandage Girl, the girlfriend of the original game's protagonist Meat Boy, from Meat Boy. It plays <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> platformer and is peppered with inter-level pro-vegetarian messages and facts about meat consumption and the livestock industry.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Mermaid {{signaled}} the re-establishment {{of the musical}} film format <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> for Disney animated films. The majority of Disney's most popular animated films from the 1930s on had been musicals, though by the 1970s and 1980s the role of music had been de-emphasized in the films. 1988's Oliver & Company {{had served as a}} test of sorts {{to the success of the}} musical format before Disney committed to the Broadway-style structure of The Little Mermaid.|$|E
5|$|Many modern historians, {{who usually}} {{consider}} Herodotus more reliable, add the 1,000 Lacedaemonians and the 900 helots to Herodotus' 5,200 to obtain 7,100 or about 7,000 men <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> number, neglecting Diodorus' Melians and Pausanias' Locrians. However, {{this is only}} one approach, and many other combinations are plausible. Furthermore, the numbers changed {{later on in the}} battle when most of the army retreated and only approximately 3,000 men remained (300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebans, possibly up to 900 helots, and 1,000 Phocians stationed above the pass, less the casualties sustained in the previous days).|$|E

5|$|The PocketStation was a {{miniature}} game console created by SCE as a peripheral {{for the original}} PlayStation. Released exclusively in Japan on December 23, 1999, it featured a monochrome LCD, a speaker, a real-time clock and infrared communication capability. It {{could also be used}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> PlayStation memory card by connecting it to a PlayStation memory card slot. It was extremely popular in Japan and Sony originally had plans to release it in the United States but the plan was ultimately scrapped due to various manufacturing and supply-and-demand problems.|$|E

Completed in 1964, the building was the first private investment for the urban renewal of the Independence Mall area. Only two blocks from Independence Hall the building, designed by Pietro Belluschi and George M. Ewing Co., was lauded for its respect to the nearby park and historical buildings. Philadelphia's city planners praised the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> for all redevelopment buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of NATO brought about some standardization of allied military terminology, procedures, and technology, which {{in many cases}} meant European countries adopting US practices. The roughly 1300Standardization Agreements (STANAG) codified many of the common practices that NATO has achieved. Hence, the 7.62×51mm NATO rifle cartridge {{was introduced in the}} 1950s <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> firearm cartridge among many NATO countries. Fabrique Nationale de Herstal's FAL, which used the 7.62mm NATO cartridge, was adopted by 75 countries, including many outside of NATO. Also, aircraft marshalling signals were standardized, so that any NATO aircraft could land at any NATO base. Other standards such as the NATO phonetic alphabet have made their way beyond NATO into civilian use.|$|E

5|$|The {{length of}} the pitch, or field, for {{international}} adult matches is {{in the range of}} 100–110m (110–120yd) and the width is in the range of 64–75m (70–80yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90–120m (100–130yd) length and 45–90m (50–100yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105m (344ft) long and 68m (223ft) wide <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> pitch dimension for international matches; however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.|$|E

It was then removed from this status in 1996, {{and has not been}} awarded since.

5|$|Through {{observation}} of the light curves of many Type Ia supernovae, {{it was discovered that}} they appear to have a common peak luminosity. By measuring the luminosity of these events, the distance to their host galaxy can be estimated with good accuracy. Thus this category of supernovae has become highly useful <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> candle for measuring cosmic distances. In 1998, the High-Z Supernova Search and the Supernova Cosmology Project discovered that the most distant Type Ia supernovae appeared dimmer than expected. This has provided evidence that {{the expansion of the universe}} may be accelerating.|$|E

50|$|Potassium {{hydrogen}} phthalate, {{often called}} simply KHP, is an acidic salt compound.

It is not hygroscopic. It is also used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> primary <b>standard</b> for calibrating pH meters because, besides the properties just mentioned, its pH in solution is very stable.
