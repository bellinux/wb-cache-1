5|$|Haydn's {{choice of}} D major for this quartet, {{with the second}} {{movement}} in D minor, optimises the use of open strings and allows for the work to be the loudest and most grandiose of the set.

The use of a closing phrase to start the movement {{is the first of}} a number of unsettling incidents in the movement. The exposition withholds the expected cadence to the dominant almost until the exposition ends. And the movement itself has a tentative pianissimo ending that serves more as a link to the D-minor Adagio than a proper conclusion.|$|E
