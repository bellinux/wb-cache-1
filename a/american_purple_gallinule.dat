5000|$|The <b>purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> (Porphyrio martinicus, {{sometimes}} said as martinica) is a swamphen in {{the rail}} family, Rallidae. Also {{known locally as}} the yellow-legged gallinule. The specific name martinica denotes [...] "of Martinique".|$|R
40|$|Species {{occupying a}} broad {{latitudinal}} range may show greater phenotypic plasticity in behavior than species with smaller ranges or more specific habitat requirements. This study investigates {{for the first}} time the occurrence of conspecific brood parasitism (CBP) in sympatric tropical populations of the common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus pauxilla Bangs) and the <b>American</b> <b>purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> (Porphyrula martinica L.). CBP occurred in at least 20 % (N = 76) of common moorhen nests on the Rio Chagres in Panama. Half (N = 20) of the parasitic eggs were accepted, but 10 were destroyed or ejected from host nests. Introductions of experimental eggs into nests revealed hosts were more likely to accept parasitism later in the host's laying period and during incubation, consistent with expectation of an adaptive response. CBP was not detected in a small sympatric population of American purple gallinules. Members of this population did not eject experimental eggs, suggesting a lack of experience with costly CBP. Contrasting ecological factors help explain why these two species of rail (Family Rallidae) differ in regard to CBP. Purple gallinule territories were sparse, owing to the distribution of preferred habitat. Moorhens flocked outside of the breeding season. They nested more synchronously, at higher densities, and primarily in ephemeral floating vegetation. Further, moorhens suffered a rate of nest loss nearly double that of American purple gallinules, and this increased over the course of the breeding season. Moorhen clutches were larger on average, and more variable in size than those of purple gallinules. Reproductive effort and rate (seasonality) constitute important life history differences between these species that may constrain the evolution of reproductive tactics. Comparing these sympatric populations, and others differing in life-history traits and ecological constraints, highlights the role of risk management in the evolution of CBP...|$|E

40|$|Lead {{exposure}} in waterfowl was studied using noninvasive fecal sampling in the Guadalquivir Marshes in Spain, an area {{affected by the}} 1998 Aznalcóllar mine disaster. Feces of greylag geese (Anser anser, n = 191) and <b>purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> (Porphyrio porphyrio, n = 91) were collected from three different impacted sites (Entremuros, Caracoles and Cerro de los Ánsares) during the winters of 2004 to 2008. Lead and aluminium (an indicator of sediment ingestion) and Pb isotope signatures (to discriminate between sources of Pb exposure) were analyzed in freeze-dried, acid digested samples. The concentrations of fecal porphyrins and biliverdin were determined as noninvasive biomarkers to study Pb exposure effects. Results showed a decrease in Pb exposure over time in wintering greylag geese. In contrast, for <b>purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> resident in the Entremuros a clear trend was not evident. For both species, sediment ingestion {{appeared to be the}} main source of exposure to Pb. In the Entremuros, some samples from <b>purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> were detected with higher Pb levels than expected for simple soil ingestion, and these had Pb isotopic profiles compatible with mining sludge or Pb shot. Whilst fecal Pb isotopic profiles were effective in differentiating between samples from sites with different levels and sources of pollution, the combined use of element ratios (such as Pb/Al) and other non-traditional stable isotope signatures may also prove worthwhile. Overall, the fecal Pb levels detected were below those described in feces for waterfowl from other uncontaminated areas(, 10 mg/g d. w.). Despite this, for both species fecal Pb levels were positively correlated with porphyrin excretion, and for purpl...|$|R

Whilst the west bank behind the sand bar has been conserved as a large wetland which has become an excellent habitat for a large variety of water fowl and has become an important stopping point for thousands of migrating birds.

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al XXXth International Union of Game Biologists and Perdix XIII, celebrados en Barcelona (España) del 5 al 9 de septiembre de 2011. We studied lead (Pb) {{exposure}} in waterfowl using non-invasive fecal sampling {{in an area}} of the Guadalquivir Marshes (Doñana National/Natural Park, SW Spain) affected by the Aznalcollar mine disaster in 1998. Fresh greylag geese (Anser anser, n = 191) and <b>purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> (Porphyrio porphyrio, n = 91) feces were collected from three sites (Caracoles, Entremuros and Cerro de los Ánsares) during the 2004 to 2008 wintering seasons. Lead and aluminium (Al; as an indicator of soil ingestion) were analyzed in dried/acid digested samples. The concentration of fecal porphyrins and biliverdin (as biomarkers of Pb effect) and Pb isotope profiles (to discriminate between potential sources of Pb exposure) were determined in a selection of samples. Results showed a decrease in Pb exposure over time in greylag geese wintering in Doñana, and that soil ingestion was the main source of exposure. In contrast, in <b>purple</b> <b>gallinules</b> resident in the Entremuros, Pb {{exposure in}}creased during the sampling period. In the Entremuros, both species appear to be exposed to high Pb sources, and these probably include Pb shot pellets (from historic hunting activity), iron plaque (on roots of emergent plants such as Typha and Scirpus, rich in Pb) or remnant patches of polluted soil dating from the mine spill.

50|$|A five-year bird {{census of}} the park was {{completed}} in July, 2006. Nearly four dozen additional bird species {{were added to the}} park's checklist. The newly revised SLSP bird checklist features 249 bird species. Each spring over 200 bird species are possible. Texas' largest inland waterbird colony can be found on 29+ spoil islands. The nonstop sight and sounds of this colony is best viewed from along the west levee. This colony is growing and now hosts over 2,200 heron, egret, roseate spoonbill, anhinga, Neotropic cormorant and ibis nests each year. <b>Purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> and least bittern also breed on the lake.

Lesser jacana and the <b>purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> are common on the lake despite being rare {{in other parts of}} Africa and Madagascar squacco heron, black heron, African darter and African skimmers are often seen.

5|$|Of vertebrates, {{numerous}} {{species of}} frog, salamander, snake, turtle, and alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) proliferate in marsh waters. Most {{of these animals}} are active at night. Frog choruses are overwhelming; during alligator mating season the grunts of bulls join in. The marshes around the St. Johns River upper basin teem with birds. A recent study counted 60,000 birds in one month, nesting or feeding in the upper basin. Wading and water birds like the white ibis (Eudocimus albus), wood stork (Mycteria americana), and <b>purple</b> <b>gallinule</b> (Porphyrio martinicus) depend on the water for raising their young: they prey upon small fish and tadpoles in shallow water and puddles in the dry season. In successful seasons, their colonies can number in the thousands, creating a cacophony of calls and fertilizing trees with their droppings.|$|R
