5|$|Andrea Anders as Linda Katherine Zwordling: Linda is {{a tester}} {{in one of}} Veridian's departments. She finds herself very {{attracted}} to Ted, but maintains other relationships and reminds Ted repeatedly that he has rejected {{the idea of a}} workplace romance with her. She seems to be <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> outsider to the corporate culture. Often she demands that Ted consider the horrible ramifications of the company policies or activities. Her relationship with the scientists is strained by her rejection of the weird things they do in the name of science. Despite this, she finds herself increasingly looking at Veronica as a mentor as the series progresses.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that these}} numbers are for the {{terrestrial}} surface and not really a global average. Whether dimming (or brightening) occurred over the ocean has been <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unknown though a specific measurement (see below, Causes) measured effects some 400 miles (643.7km) from India over the Indian Ocean towards the Maldives Islands. Regional effects probably dominate but are not strictly confined to the land area, and the effects will be driven by regional air circulation. A 2009 review by Wild et al. found that widespread variation in regional and time effects. There was solar brightening beyond 2000 at numerous stations in Europe, the United States, and Korea. The brightening seen at sites in Antarctica during the 1990s, influenced by recovering from the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991, fades after 2000. The brightening tendency also seems to level off at sites in Japan. In China there is some indication for a renewed dimming, after the stabilization in the 1990s. A continuation of the long-lasting dimming is also noted at the sites in India. Overall, the available data suggest continuation of the brightening beyond the year 2000 at numerous locations, yet less pronounced and coherent than during the 1990s, with more regions with no clear changes or declines. Therefore, globally, greenhouse warming after 2000 may be less modulated by surface solar variations than in prior decades. The largest reductions {{are found in the}} northern hemisphere mid-latitudes. Visible light and infrared radiation seem to be most affected rather than the ultraviolet part of the spectrum.|$|E

It was <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{implosion}} from 227 for 3, but runs came thick and fast in that period, so Yorkshire wouldn't be too disappointed with losing their wickets. Northamptonshire started well, getting to 163 for 2 after all their top four got starts, but two wickets from England Test bowler Matthew Hoggard started to turn the match. From then on, the Northamptonshire effort just stopped dead, as they lost five wickets for 24 runs to fall to 216 for 9.

25|$|Having {{set their}} sights on A.C. Milan player Antonio Nocerino, D.C. United found their {{negotiation}} was undermined when Orlando City S.C.'s Kaka apparently convinced his former teammate to reject United's offer and pursue {{a contract with}} Orlando. Fortunately, a plan B quickly emerged. The team filled the holding mid slot by trading for MLS veteran Marcelo Sarvas, and got <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unexpected boost when {{the name of a}} former acquisition target, Boca Junior's midfielder/forward Luciano Acosta suddenly showed up on the transfer rumor wires. Within a week, United had the diminutive midfielder signed and training in their Florida pre-season camp. The next day, Acosta even assisted on the lone goal in a match against Tampa Bay Rowdies. Reportedly, United agreed to a trade of a conditional draft pick to New York Red Bulls, who had gained discovery claim priority on Acosta, after United had relinquished its own. As preseason continued, the team released Conor Doyle {{to make way for a}} trialist from USL side Pittsburgh Riverhounds, winger Rob Vincent. United took to the pitch for the first time in 2016, with a 2015-16 CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinal series against Queretaro FC. In a match in the Mexican mountain city, D.C. United mostly held its own. But, missed chances by the visitors opened the door for the home team, which scored twice in the final 20 minutes, to take a daunting 2-0 lead in the series.|$|E

25|$|Oxygen {{consumption}} (VO2) {{during exercise}} is best {{described by the}} Fick Equation: VO2=Q x (a-vO2diff), which states {{that the amount of}} oxygen consumed is equal to cardiac output (Q) multiplied by the difference between arterial and venous oxygen concentrations. More simply put, oxygen consumption is dictated by the quantity of blood distributed by the heart as well as the working muscle's ability to take up the oxygen within that blood; however, this is <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> oversimplification. Although cardiac output is thought to be the limiting factor of this relationship in healthy individuals, {{it is not the only}} determinant of VO2 max. That is, factors such as the ability of the lung to oxygenate the blood must also be considered. Various pathologies and anomalies cause conditions such as diffusion limitation, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and pulmonary shunts that can limit oxygenation of the blood and therefore oxygen distribution. In addition, the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood is also an important determinant of the equation. Oxygen carrying capacity is often the target of exercise (ergogenic aids) aids used in endurance sports to increase the volume percentage of red blood cells (hematocrit), such as through blood doping or the use of erythropoietin (EPO). Furthermore, peripheral oxygen uptake is reliant on a rerouting of blood flow from relatively inactive viscera to the working skeletal muscles, and within the skeletal muscle, capillary to muscle fiber ratio influences oxygen extraction.|$|E
