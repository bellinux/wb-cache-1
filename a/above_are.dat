5|$|Classically, {{algebraic}} {{functions are}} defined by an algebraic equation, and transcendental functions (including those discussed <b>above)</b> <b>are</b> defined by some property that holds for them, such as a differential equation. For example, the exponential function is the function which is equal to its own derivative everywhere, and assumes the value 1 at the origin. However, one may equally well define an analytic function by its Taylor series.|$|E

5|$|The solar heavy-element abundances {{described}} <b>above</b> <b>are</b> typically measured both using spectroscopy of the Sun's photosphere and {{by measuring}} abundances in meteorites {{that have never}} been heated to melting temperatures. These meteorites are thought to retain the composition of the protostellar Sun and are thus not affected by settling of heavy elements. The two methods generally agree well.|$|E

The Highlands are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including Loch Lomond and Loch Ness. Some parts of the coastline consist of machair, a low lying dune pasture land.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the hall}} {{is a second}} hall, forming part of the Duchess' suite of rooms. An oratory in the south wall, {{overlooking}} the courtyard, contains a piscina and credence niche. The oratory gives access to mural passages leading to the walkway along the curtain wall. The timber ceiling of the Duchess' hall, and the timber floors and roof <b>above,</b> <b>are</b> of the 1880s. The upper parts of the stonework are among the repairs dating from 1580.|$|E
5|$|In {{physical}} terms the function is {{represented as a}} superposition of sine waves and the coefficients give information about the function's frequency spectrum. A complex-number form of Fourier series is also commonly used. The concrete formulae <b>above</b> <b>are</b> consequences of a more general mathematical duality called Pontryagin duality. Applied to the group R, it yields the classical Fourier transform; an application in physics are reciprocal lattices, where the underlying group is a finite-dimensional real vector space endowed with the additional datum of a lattice encoding positions of atoms in crystals.|$|E

5|$|Protactinium {{occurs in}} {{uraninite}} (pitchblende) at concentrations of about 0.3-3 parts 231Pa per million parts (ppm) of ore. Whereas the usual content {{is closer to}} 0.3 ppm (e.g. in Jáchymov, Czech Republic), some ores from the Democratic Republic of the Congo have about 3 ppm. Protactinium is homogeneously dispersed in most natural materials and in water, but at much lower concentrations {{on the order of}} one part per trillion, that corresponds to the radioactivity of 0.1 picocuries (pCi)/g. There is about 500 times more protactinium in sandy soil particles than in water, even the water present in the same sample of soil. Much higher ratios of 2,000 and <b>above</b> <b>are</b> measured in loam soils and clays, such as bentonite.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the verdict}} of juries, no player that throws a ball game; no player that {{undertakes}} or promises to throw a ball game; no player that sits in a conference {{with a bunch of}} crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing ball games are planned and discussed and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball. Of course, I don't know that any of these men will apply for reinstatement, but if they do, the <b>above</b> <b>are</b> at least a few of the rules that will be enforced. Just keep in mind that, regardless {{of the verdict}} of juries, baseball is competent to protect itself against crooks, {{both inside and outside the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{came to a}} head on New Year's Eve of 1958, when Atlas {{ordered an}} all-out attack on Ryan. The battle left many dead, and the few sane {{survivors}} barricaded themselves away. What once was a beautiful utopia had fallen into a crumbling dystopia. Some of the events described <b>above</b> <b>are</b> revisited and expanded upon in the downloadable expansion , which takes place in Rapture during the latter months of 1958 and leads up to Atlas' assault on Ryan's forces.|$|E

5|$|The Borneo shark is slim-bodied, with a long, pointed snout and oblique, slit-like {{nostrils}} {{preceded by}} narrow, nipple-shaped flaps of skin. The eyes are rather large and circular, and equipped with nictitating membranes. The {{corners of the}} sizable mouth bear short, indistinct furrows, and immediately <b>above</b> <b>are</b> a series of enlarged pores that are unique within the genus. There are 25–26 upper and 23–25 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth have a single, narrow, oblique cusp with strongly serrated edges, and large cusplets on the trailing side. The lower teeth are similar, but {{tend to be more}} slender and finely serrated. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E

5|$|The hurst {{of trees}} with a {{representation}} of the Pole Star <b>above</b> <b>are</b> a play on the name Northwood. The mitre and fleurs-de-lys refer to the Abbey of Bec Herlewin in Normandy, to whom the Lordship of Ruislip was granted, where there was a cell of the Order. The Manor was later seized by Henry V and granted as part of the endowment of King's College, Cambridge. The Abbey and the College were dedicated to St. Mary, one of whose symbols is a fleur-de-lis. The 'rye slips' are a play on the name Ruislip. The wild boar shows that the Lordship was an ancient one, granted when the land was forest roamed by wild boars.|$|E
