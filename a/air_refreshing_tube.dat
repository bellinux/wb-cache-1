50|$|In 1819 Strutt {{designed}} and built the Derby Infirmary, which he worked on with his friend Charles Sylvester. Sylvester documented the new ways of heating hospitals that {{were included in the}} design and the healthier features such as self-cleaning and <b>air</b> <b>refreshing</b> toilets. Strutt incorporated many new features into the infirmary including his fire-proof construction and novel heating that allowed the patients to breathe fresh heated air whilst old air was channelled up to a glass and iron dome at the centre. Strutt's infirmary culminated in a giant statue of Aesculapius designed by William John Coffee. Sylvester described the advances that Strutt had made and this was successful in three ways. Sylvester was able to take the new ideas for heating and apply them in numerous other building projects. The Derby Infirmary was seen as a leader in European architecture and architects and visiting Royalty were brought to see its features.|$|R

60|$|He {{reached his}} house. The Bird was out. He gave orders for himself {{not to be}} disturbed, {{and he went to}} bed; but in vain he tried to sleep. What rack exceeds the torture of an excited brain and an {{exhausted}} body? His hands and feet were like ice, his brow like fire; his ears rung with supernatural roaring; a nausea had seized upon him, and death he would have welcomed. In vain, in vain he courted repose; in vain, in vain he had recourse to every expedient to wile himself to slumber. Each minute he started from his pillow with some phrase which reminded him of his late fearful society. Hour after hour moved on with its leaden pace; each hour he heard strike, and each hour seemed an age. Each hour was only a signal to cast off some covering, or shift his position. It was, at length, morning. With a feeling that he should go mad if he remained any longer in bed, he rose, and paced his chamber. The <b>air</b> <b>refreshed</b> him.

60|$|I add that--while England {{is among}} the {{greatest}} of lands in political freedom, or the idea of it, and in stalwart personal character, &c.--the spirit of English literature is not great, at least is not greatest--and its products are no models for us. With the exception of Shakspere, there is no first-class genius in that literature--which, with a truly vast amount of value, and of artificial beauty, (largely from the classics,) is almost always material, sensual, not spiritual--almost always congests, makes plethoric, not frees, expands, dilates--is cold, anti-democratic, loves to be sluggish and stately, and shows much of that characteristic of vulgar persons, the dread of saying or doing something not at all improper in itself, but unconventional, {{and that may be}} laugh'd at. In its best, the sombre pervades it; it is moody, melancholy, and, to give it its due, expresses, in characters and plots, those qualities, in an unrival'd manner.

60|$|But they {{considered}} the lama's presence a perfect safeguard against all consequences, and impenitently brought Kim of their best--even to a drink of chang--the barley-beer that comes from Ladakh-way. Then they thawed out in the sun, and sat with their legs hanging over infinite abysses, chattering, laughing, and smoking. They judged India and its Government solely from their experience of wandering Sahibs who had employed them or their friends as shikarris. Kim heard tales of shots missed upon ibex, serow, or markhor, by Sahibs twenty years in their graves--every detail lighted from behind like twigs on tree-tops seen against lightning. They told him of their little diseases, and, more important, the diseases of their tiny, sure-footed cattle; of trips as far as Kotgarh, where the strange missionaries live, and beyond even to marvellous Simla, where the streets are paved with silver, and anyone, look you, can get service with the Sahibs, who ride about in two-wheeled carts and spend money with a spade. Presently, grave and aloof, walking very heavily, the lama joined himself to the chatter under the eaves, and they gave him great room.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a character generator which was buict for a <b>refreshed</b> cathode-ray <b>tube</b> (CRT) display and demonstrates {{the feasibility of}} displayin 9 high quality dot-matrix characters using the low-band width sinusoidal scan. The CRT used was a low-cost entertainment-quality television tube, and hence had a very poor deflection band width. Settling time for the CRT system was about 10 microseconds. A technique was developed and made operational which displayed a whole dot-matrix character in a time which was less than one settling time of the display system. It is an application of the existing technique called sinusoidal scan to the display of dot-matrix characters. A data compression technique was also invented and implemented. It allows up to a 75 percent reduction {{in the size of}} the stored character tables which are normally associated with dot-matrix displays. The technique involves a digital algorithm which fills in dots between given dots in a matrix. This technique proved quite effective in producing good quality characters, and is economicaHy attractive. (Author/RM) LI 001 64...|$|R

40|$|Kotmale {{underground}} hydro {{electric power}} generating station {{is the first}} ever built underground structure (hydro electric power station) in Sri Lanka, which was commissioned in 1988. This hydro power station is situated about 25 km south west of the central hill country main city Kandy, which has a tropical climate ambient temperature ranging from 20 Celsius to 30 Celsius during the dry season. Location of the hydro power station Cavern where the three 70 MW generators, turbines and other accessories are located is 250 m below the ground level. The power station cavern is accessed through a 500 m long tunnel to the underground. In a structure of this nature, {{it is important to}} keep the temperature and the air quantity in an acceptable range for the well being of the occupants. The ventilation to the power station cavern is provided through a forced air ventilation system which pumps air through a 250 m long tunnel from the top. The power station cavern itself consists of three floors, where ventilation air is distributed through a duct system which runs through the floors. But, according to the past experience, it has been noticed that the rate of ventilation or the <b>air</b> <b>refreshing</b> rate is insufficient for the thermal comfort and to maintain the air quality inside of this structure. Traditional methods of evaluating thermal comfort are not capable of analyzing the air flow path of a complex built structure of this nature. Hence, this paper discusses the application of a 3 D CFD model to analyze and simulate the ventilation air flow path, in order to analyze the thermal comfort of this underground built environment to find out the issues related to thermal comfort and air quality of the system that affects to its occupants i. e. operators and maintenance staff.
