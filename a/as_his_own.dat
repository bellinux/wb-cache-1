As the background to Bond's childhood, Higson used Bond's obituary in You Only Live Twice as well <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> and Fleming's childhoods. In forming the early Bond character, Higson created the origins of some of Bond's character traits, including his love of cars and fine wine.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, as Berkman {{finished}} {{the fifth year}} of his sentence, he applied to the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons. Having served <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> attorney, Berkman had failed to object to the trial judge's rulings and thus had no legal basis for an appeal; a pardon was his only hope for early release.

Working through the committee, he brought Jefferson's plan to the Senate floor with its essentials intact. Because the plan provided for the taxation of Louisiana residents without giving them representation in Congress, Federalists and some Democratic-Republicans opposed it. Nevertheless, it passed by a vote of 26–6.|$|E

5|$|Darwin {{summarised}} his speculation in {{his essay}} on the Elevation of Patagonia. Though tentative, it challenged Lyell's ideas. Darwin drew on measurements by the Beagles officers as well <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> measurements to propose that the plains had been raised in successive stages by forces acting over a wide area, rather than smaller scale actions in a continuous movement. However, he supported Lyell in finding evidence to dismiss a sudden deluge when normal processes were suddenly speeded.

Although he was defeated in 841 in battle with Niall Caille of the Cenél nEógain, the High King according to some, Feidlimid's achievements were exceptional. Not since Congal Cáech of the Dál nAraidi, King of Ulaid in the early 7th century, had any king but an Uí Néill one been reckoned King of Tara in any account.|$|E
