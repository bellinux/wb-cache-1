40|$|Empirical legal {{research}} in the UK and in the Netherlands has provided data {{on the extent to}} which the transaction avoidance rules (avoidance powers, <b>actio</b> <b>Pauliana)</b> generate practical problems. This article’s goal is to explore the similarities and differences of the data. To achieve this, existing empirical data found in the Dutch and the UK research are compared. From the comparison, it follows that the UK and The Netherlands share similar problems, i. e. there are no proceeds in a substantial number of cases in which the office-holder (or liquidator) encounters a suspect transaction, the majority of the disputes are conducted in the shadow of the law, proceeds are obtained more often from settlements than from proceedings, insufficient funds and evidence problems are experienced as major obstacles for successfully invoking the transaction avoidance rules, and a presumption or shift of burden of proof influences the outcome significantly...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the history of}} Latin maxims and expressions in English, Estonian and Polish legal languages {{and the influence of}} Latin on contemporary legal language and its translation. A number of maxims and expressions were examined by comparing their present meanings in those three legal systems. A selection of fifteen of them is presented in the article, namely: ab intestato, corpus iuris civilis, error iuris, fraus est celerem fraudem, ignorantia iuris neminem excusat, impossibilium nulla est obligatio, inter arma silent leges, ipso iure, lex non scripta, pacta sunt servanda, qui tacet – consentire videtur, restitutio in integrum,m sub iudice, and summum ius summa iniuria.

The first part of the paper discusses the problem of challenging the legal actions decreasing the conjugal joint property taken by the spouse who is not the debtor. Generally, each spouse is free to manage the joint property of spouses (Article 36 para. 2 of the Family and Guardianship Code), whereas <b>actio</b> <b>pauliana</b> is a protection measure against the debtor’s acts made with the intent to avoid satisfying the creditor. Specific problems arise therefore, when the fraudulent conveyance decreasing the joint property of spouses is made by the spouse who is not the debtor. The author analyses the measures available to the creditor in situations when the non-debtor’s fraudulent conveyance requires the other spouse’s (debtor’s) mandatory consent (Article 37 of the Family and Guardianship Code), as well as cases, when the non-debtor’s fraudulent conveyance does not require such a consent. The second part of the paper consists of the analysis of the protection of obligations that can be satisfy only from specific items of the joint property of spouses (Article 41 para. 2 - 3 of the Family and Guardianship Code) in cases when the subject of the fraudulent transfer was an item of joint property of spouses, which the creditor may not demand satisfaction from.

40|$|This article {{questions}} {{the adequacy of}} rescission {{as a response to}} breaches of trust under Korean trusts law. When trustees dispose of trust assets in breach of trust, the beneficiary is entitled to rescind the disposition concluded by him (though the right to rescind is barred when someone who purchases the assets for value without notice of the breach). The argument here will be {{that it is hard to}} locate a theoretical justification for awarding rescission to the beneficiary under Korean law since he is only a holder of a personal right that only binds his obligor(i. e., his trustee). We can of course find two cases in which a personal right-holder is allowed to cancel the transaction entered into between others. The first case is <b>Actio</b> <b>Pauliana</b> in which the creditor can turn over the effect of the contract made between his obligor and third parties. The second case is parent`s right to rescind the contract made between his minor children and third parties. However, the former is only possible to be established under some stringent requirements and the latter is supported by a strong policy (i. e., protecting minors). But, as mentioned in the article, the beneficiary`s right to rescind neither requires strict conditions nor has a viable policy-based ground. Thus, the article concludes that the beneficiary`s right to rescind is an anomalous remedy. The article suggests that the deal transacted between the trustee and third party should be void. When we explore the following three cases that structurally resemble the case of breach of trust, the effect should be to make the transaction void rather than voidable. These cases are as follows: (1) when a partner disposes of partnership`s asset in breach of partnership`s constitution; (2) when a bankrupt disposes of his assets after he is declared bankrupt; (3) when a director disposes of company`s assets in breach of his powers. The article argues that the transaction concluded between the trustee and third party should also follow those cases and be treated as a void transaction. This would be a much more theoretically justified and practically plausible approach under the current law of trusts in Korea...|$|E
