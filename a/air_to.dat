5|$|Pulmonates {{are mostly}} land {{snails and slugs}} that have {{developed}} a simple lung from the mantle cavity. An externally located opening called the pneumostome allows <b>air</b> <b>to</b> be taken into the mantle cavity lung.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs when}} the opening that allows <b>air</b> <b>to</b> enter the pleural space functions as a one-way valve, allowing more <b>air</b> <b>to</b> enter with every breath but none to escape. The body compensates by increasing the respiratory rate and tidal volume (size of each breath), worsening the problem. Unless corrected, hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels) and respiratory arrest eventually follow.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of calcium {{is that of}} a typical heavy alkaline earth metal. For example, calcium spontaneously reacts with water more quickly than magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. It also reacts with the oxygen and nitrogen in the <b>air</b> <b>to</b> form a mixture of calcium oxide and calcium nitride. When finely divided, it spontaneously burns in <b>air</b> <b>to</b> produce the nitride. In bulk, calcium is less reactive: it quickly forms a hydration coating in moist air, but below 30% relative humidity it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Under similar {{conditions}} and using similar catalysts as {{are used for}} butane oxidation, the oxygen in <b>air</b> <b>to</b> produce acetic acid can oxidize acetaldehyde.|$|E
5|$|Ventilation. Where gas {{cylinders}} are carried inside a vehicle, {{in the same}} space as people, the windows should be kept open to allow <b>air</b> <b>to</b> circulate.|$|E

50|$|The series, which premiered <b>airing</b> {{concurrent}} <b>to</b> season four of Vanderpump Rules, didn't return <b>to</b> <b>air</b> concurrent <b>to</b> season 5 of the series, nor has it aired {{any further}} episodes online.|$|R
5|$|A tornado is not {{necessarily}} visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor in the <b>air</b> <b>to</b> condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. This results {{in the formation of}} a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.|$|E
5|$|Aerophones, {{which produce}} a sound with a {{vibrating}} column of air; they {{are sorted into}} free aerophones such as a bullroarer or whip, which move freely through the air; flutes, which cause the <b>air</b> <b>to</b> pass over a sharp edge; reed instruments, which use a vibrating reed; and lip-vibrated aerophones such as trumpets, for which the lips themselves function as vibrating reeds.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{supplying}} <b>air</b> <b>to</b> the engine, {{the intake}} also supplied air through the ramp bleed to the propelling nozzle. The nozzle ejector (or aerodynamic) design, with variable exit area and secondary {{flow from the}} intake, contributed to good expansion efficiency from take-off to cruise.|$|E

5|$|Beyond the {{decorative}} {{features of the}} building, the 5th Avenue Theatre also contained notable technical features when originally built. An ascending orchestra pit and independent Wurlitzer organ platform allowed the musicians to be raised up to main stage height or to orchestra pit level from the basement below. The ventilation system had thermostatic controls throughout the building, and allowed the <b>air</b> <b>to</b> be 'washed' prior to its introduction into the venue at outlets under every third seat.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} 16, Booth was {{interested}} in the theatre and in politics, and he became a delegate from Bel <b>Air</b> <b>to</b> a rally by the Know Nothing Party for Henry Winter Davis, the anti-immigrant party's candidate for Congress in the 1854 elections. Booth aspired to {{follow in the footsteps of}} his father and his actor brothers Edwin and Junius Brutus, Jr. He began practicing elocution daily in the woods around Tudor Hall and studying Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Compressor diving is a {{rudimentary}} method of surface-supplied diving {{used in some}} tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece and allows excess <b>air</b> <b>to</b> spill out between the lips.|$|E

5|$|From December 1983, 75 Jaguar GR1s and 14 T2s were updated to the GR1A and T2A {{standards}} with FIN1064 {{navigation and}} attack systems replacing the original NAVWASS. At {{about the same}} time, most were also re-engined with Adour 104 engines and were fitted {{with the ability to}} carry Sidewinder <b>air</b> <b>to</b> air missiles or AN-ALQ-101(V)-10 electronic countermeasures pods under the wings.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to add more options for {{travelers}} in Roanoke, the airport added non-stop service to Orlando in May 2006 and Tampa in December 2006 with Allegiant Air. This is largely seen {{as the product of}} an effort by local leaders to bring new and improved service to the airport through both existing and new carriers. Earlier attempts to lobby AirTran Airways and the now defunct Independence <b>Air</b> <b>to</b> serve the airport were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|In {{the hamlet}} of Darshill, {{on the road}} from Shepton Mallet to Wells, there is a silk drying shed, known locally as a handle house, three walls of which are full of holes to allow the passage of <b>air</b> <b>to</b> aid {{in the process of}} drying teasle heads, which were used to raise the nap on cloth in the textile process.|$|E

5|$|Joseph Thomas is an Australian citizen. On 23 March 2001 he left Australia and {{travelled}} by <b>air</b> <b>to</b> Pakistan, crossing into Afghanistan by land. For {{the next}} three months, he was alleged to have trained at the Al Farouq training camp {{near the city of}} Kandahar, before travelling to Kabul in July 2001. Over the next eighteen months or so, Thomas stayed in various Al Qaeda safe houses, and is alleged to have made contact with several Al Qaeda officials.|$|E
5|$|Jun Maeda, {{the main}} {{scenario}} writer of Air, commented {{that in the}} early stages of Air production, it was already decided that it was to be an adult game, and he further assumes that if it was not at least first released with adult content, that it would not have been as commercially successful. Maeda also commented that he wanted to write <b>Air</b> <b>to</b> give players the chance to experience the entire story as a whole rather than just a sum of differing parts as typical bishōjo games do, including Kanon. While attempting to do this, Maeda also tried to simultaneously make it seem similar to typical visual novels in the same genre as <b>Air</b> <b>to</b> give the game appeal to the players who often play such games. As such, while the game incorporates stories from several characters, they are all of varying lengths.|$|E
5|$|Large {{fish are}} caught with the bill-tip, then tossed {{up in the}} <b>air</b> <b>to</b> be caught and slid into the gullet head-first. A gull will {{sometimes}} stand on the pelican's head, peck it to distraction, and grab a fish from the open bill. Pelicans in their turn sometimes snatch prey from other waterbirds.|$|E
