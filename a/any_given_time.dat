5|$|The {{climate of}} a region depends {{on a number of}} factors, {{especially}} latitude. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the tropical climate at the equator to the polar climate in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the Earth's axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane. Thus, at <b>any</b> <b>given</b> <b>time</b> during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the sun. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At <b>any</b> <b>given</b> <b>time,</b> regardless of season, the northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons.|$|E

5|$|Despite the improvements, the {{in-service}} {{rates for}} the F-84E remained poor with {{less than half of}} the aircraft operational at <b>any</b> <b>given</b> <b>time.</b> This was primarily due to a severe shortage of spares for the Allison engines. The expectation was that F-84Es would fly 25 hours per month, accumulating 100 hours between engine overhauls. The actual flight hours for Korean War and NATO deployments rapidly outpaced the supply and Allison's ability to manufacture new engines. The F-84E was withdrawn from USAF service in 1956, lingering with ANG units until 1959.|$|E
