5|$|However Saudi {{judges are}} {{expected}} to consult six medieval texts from the Hanbali school of jurisprudence before reaching a decision. The Hanbali school is noted for its literalist interpretation of the Qur'an and hadith. If the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> {{not found in the}} six Hanbali texts, the judge may then consult the jurisprudence of the other three main Sunni schools or apply his independent judgment and legal reasoning, referred to as ijtihad.|$|E
5|$|After the {{contestant}} decides {{for which}} amount to play, the prize money is {{displayed on the}} gameboard. The contestant and chaser are presented with the same multiple choice question, and each locks in their answer, which cannot then be changed; the other has five seconds to answer after them, otherwise they are locked out and do not advance on the gameboard. For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves {{one step closer to}} the team bank. Similarly, the chaser moves one step closer to the contestant's prize money with each correct answer. Further questions are asked until the contestant reaches the end of the board (thus banking the prize money), or the chaser catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game. No movement is made by the contestant or the chaser if an incorrect <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> provided or if they are locked out by the time limit.|$|E

5|$|Deckard's unicorn-dream sequence, {{inserted}} into the Director's Cut and concomitant with Gaff's parting gift of an origami unicorn, is {{seen by many as}} showing that Deckard is a replicant—because Gaff could have accessed Deckard's implanted memories. The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity, or that the absence of a decisive <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> crucial to the film's main theme. The film's inherent ambiguity and uncertainty, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from multiple perspectives.|$|E
5|$|The {{format of}} the Super Quiz {{differs from that of}} the other subject areas. Added in 1969, it offers a {{culminating}} championship event. The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.|$|E
5|$|This {{work was}} {{discovered}} by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in a Greek manuscript consisting of a poem of 44 lines, in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel, Germany in 1773. It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the Herd of the Sun by solving a number of simultaneous Diophantine equations. There is a more difficult version {{of the problem in}} which some of the answers are required to be square numbers. This version of the problem was first solved by A. Amthor in 1880, and the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> a very large number, approximately 7.760271.|$|E
50|$|After {{every three}} {{questions}}, four new <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> revealed. Five packets {{of questions and}} <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> played in round one.|$|R
50|$|On a {{challenge}}, if the <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> {{not on the}} list, the challengers got 10 points {{times the}} number of answers unrevealed (ex: if four <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> not yet revealed, the challenge would be worth 40 points) for a successful challenge; but if the <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> on the list, the challenged team gets the points; they also win bonus points in addition to the challenge points if the <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> number one.|$|R
50|$|Round 2: Both of {{the contestants}} faced three glasses of water, they must {{calculate}} {{how much water}} in these glasses in grams (They had a margin of 3 grams).

5|$|Ted (Josh Radnor) is at {{the clinic}} to remove his lower-back {{butterfly}} tattoo, where he is attracted to his doctor, Stella (Sarah Chalke). They agree {{to go to a}} movie, Plan 9 from Outer Space, but Ted does not realize Stella had brought her friends along with her, and it was not a date. At the next session, Ted suggests waiting till his ten sessions are over before asking her out, but Stella tells him she will still say no. Ted still feels that over ten weeks, she will start to like him, so decides to keep trying. Even though the first five sessions go well, Stella confirms her <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> still no. Ted decides that being nice to the receptionist, Abby (Britney Spears), would {{be a good way to}} let Stella see his good side, but instead, Abby starts to show interest in him. Upset that this didn't work, Ted tries using a self-help book he saw in Stella's clinic. When he tries talking to her about this, she reveals it isn't her book, and she detests it, while Abby confirms that Ted was reading the book in the reception.|$|E
25|$|Some people's intuition is {{that the}} <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> above 100,000. Most people's intuition {{is that it is}} in the {{thousands}} or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> 23.|$|E

50|$|Knock-Off: A {{category}} was announced and 12 possible <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> shown; nine <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> correct while three were wrong. Each contestant, in turn, selected {{one of the}} answers. A correct answer turned gold and was worth cash (four $2 answers, three $5 answers, a $10 answer, and a $15 answer; Some boards had two $3 answers replacing two worth $2). An incorrect answer turned red and eliminated that contestant {{for the remainder of}} that round. Play continued until the last correct <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> found or all three players had been eliminated. In general, the less obvious an <b>answer</b> <b>was,</b> the more it was worth.|$|R
25|$|This <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> either {{correct or}} incorrect, {{depending}} on how the question is asked. The probability of being chosen each time is 25% but probability of being chosen at least once across the 4 events is higher.
