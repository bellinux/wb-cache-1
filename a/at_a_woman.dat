25|$|Despite the {{defection}} of {{some former}} supporters, many Zuma supporters continued to rally outside the courthouse, arousing criticism by anti-rape groups for regular {{attacks on the}} integrity and moral standing of Zuma's accuser, insults yelled at {{a close friend of}} the accuser, and even stones thrown <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> that members of the crowd mistook for the accuser. Zuma's defence team introduced evidence relating to the woman's sexual past, and asserted that the sex that took place was consensual. The prosecution asserted that her lack of resistance was due to a state of shock, and that {{the relationship between the two}} was like that of a 'father-daughter' pair.|$|E

Kristiansen confessed that he had sexually abused the girl several times when he was between the age of 15 and 17 and she was between the age of 6 and 8. Kristiansen also confessed to the charges of the woman, but not for the charges of the boy.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{conventional}} chart hits of the time, [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] featured {{lyrics that}} were interpreted as expressions of resentment rather than love. Author Oliver Trager characterizes the lyrics as: [...] "Dylan's sneer <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who {{has fallen from}} grace and is reduced to fending for herself in a hostile, unfamiliar world." [...] The song's subject, [...] "Miss Lonely," [...] previously opted for easy options in life—she attended the finest schools and enjoyed high-placed friends—but now that her situation has become difficult, it appears that she has no meaningful experiences to define her character.

[...] In Theology of the Body, a series of lectures given by Pope John Paul II, Jesus' statement in Matthew 5:28 is interpreted that one can commit adultery in the heart not only with another's spouse, but also with his/her own spouse if one looks at him/her lustfully or treats him/her [...] "only as an object to satisfy instinct".|$|E

500|$|Early in the tour, Vicious {{wandered off}} from his Holiday Inn in Memphis, Tennessee, looking for drugs. He {{was found in a}} {{hospital}} with the words [...] "Gimme a fix" [...] on his chest; he had written them with a marker pen. During a concert in San Antonio, Texas, Vicious called the crowd [...] "a bunch of faggots", before striking an audience member across the head with his bass guitar. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he received simulated oral sex on stage, later declaring [...] "that's the kind of girl I like". Suffering from heroin withdrawal during a show in Dallas, Texas, he spat blood <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who had climbed onstage and punched him in the face. He was admitted to hospital later that night to treat various injuries. Offstage he is said to have kicked a female photographer, attacked a security guard, and eventually challenged one of his own bodyguards to a fight—beaten up, he is reported to have exclaimed, [...] "I like you.

500|$|On January 28, 1970, a {{third and}} final Band of Gypsys {{appearance}} took place; they performed during a music festival at Madison Square Garden benefiting the anti-Vietnam War Moratorium Committee titled the [...] "Winter Festival for Peace". American blues guitarist Johnny Winter was backstage before the concert; he recalled: [...] " [...] came in with his head down, {{sat on the couch}} alone, and put his head in his hands... He didn't move until {{it was time for the}} show." [...] Minutes after taking the stage he snapped a vulgar response <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who had shouted a request for [...] "Foxy Lady". He then began playing [...] "Earth Blues" [...] before telling the audience: [...] "That's what happens when earth fucks with space". Moments later, he briefly sat down on the drum riser before leaving the stage. Both Miles and Redding later stated that Jeffery had given Hendrix LSD before the performance. Miles believed that Jeffery gave Hendrix the drugs in an effort to sabotage the current band and bring about the return of the original Experience lineup. Jeffery fired Miles after the show and Cox quit, ending the Band of Gypsys.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Right Round" [...] {{uses the}} {{recurring}} pop rap themes of Flo Rida's music; specifically, similarities were noted between {{the song and}} [...] "Low" [...] (2007), with Allmusic reviewer David Jeffries calling [...] "Right Round" [...] its [...] "heir apparent". The song is [...] "" [...] and [...] "bass-heavy", according to Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly. The lyrics discuss being in a strip club with friends and tossing money <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> performing a striptease. Additionally, the chorus line [...] "You spin my head right round, right round / When you go down, when you go down, down" [...] {{can be interpreted as}} a reference to fellatio. Bruno Mars, co-writer of the song confirmed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that the song's chorus was referring to oral sex. Philip Lawrence, also co-writer, confessed the song was [...] "almost something we had accidentally written in the car one night just hanging out." [...] It was him, Bruno Mars, and Aaron Bay-Schuck. Bay-Schuck was playing to Bruno and Philip some tracks and wanted {{to come up with something}} big for Flo Rida, and they were just throwing out 80's ideas. The song's sexual themes have been compared to those of [...] "If U Seek Amy" [...] (2009) by Britney Spears.|$|E
500|$|Following his audition, Jack (Sean Hayes) {{receives}} a call back and is informed {{that he has}} become a finalist for the Manhattan Gay Men's Chorus. At the final auditions for the chorus, Jack is informed by the choral director that he will have a solo, but before he can sing it, Owen (Matt Damon)originally intended for the solo partbarges in and sings his part. Jack sees Owen as competition and thinks of a {{way to get rid of}} him. He learns that Owen is posing as a gay man, after observing him gaze <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b> Jack strikes a plan to get Owen to confess he is straight, in which he invites him to [...] "rehearse" [...] in Will and Grace's apartment. Jack's plan fails miserably, so he enlists the help of Grace (Debra Messing) to [...] "in" [...] Owen for him. Grace begins flirting with Owen, which ultimately leads to the two making out, prompting Jack to barge in and take a picture. Owen, however, tricks him into pulling the film out of the camera, destroying the proof. At the chorus rehearsal, Jack and Owen begin bickering, which results in Jack revealing to everyone that Owen is straight, to which Owen admits. Despite the revelation, the chorus director (Patrick Kerr) tells Owen he has made it into the chorus.|$|E

2500|$|Matthew Henry {{understood}} the commandment against adultery to prohibit sexual immorality in general, and he acknowledged the difficulty people experience: “This commandment forbids all acts of uncleanness, {{with all those}} fleshly lusts which produce those acts and war against the soul.” [...] Henry supports his interpretation with Matthew 5:28, where Jesus warns that whoever looks <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.|$|E
2500|$|The {{violence}} {{seen in the}} United States {{against abortion}} providers has generally not occurred in Australia, with two exceptions. In 2001, Peter Knight forced his way into a Melbourne clinic carrying a rifle, kerosene, and equipment to lock {{the doors of the}} clinic. Three people attempted to disarm him after he pointed his rifle <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> at the clinic. He shot and killed a security guard. Afterwards, Knight, described by the prosecution as a [...] "hermit obsessed with killing abortion doctors" [...] was convicted of murder. On 6 January 2009 A firebombing using Molotov cocktails was attempted at a medical clinic in Mosman Park, Western Australia. Faulty construction of the bombs limited damage to a single external burnt area, though if successful damage would have been severe. It is believed that the individuals who made the attack were responsible for graffiti [...] "baby killers" [...] on the site, indicating an anti-abortion reason for the attack. The site turned out to in fact not be an abortion clinic, though the attackers most likely were not aware of this.|$|E
2500|$|... "Berlin", set {{later in}} the season, {{features}} Tony and Ziva departing for Germany to track down Ilan Bodnar, her father's killer. Before the episode aired, Glasberg disclosed that they would share a slow dance while there, resulting in [...] "a very personal moment of vulnerability where her guard goes down and she lets herself melt into his arms". De Pablo added, [...] "You also see [...] as a man Teddy Bear — like, a very sweet but manly man, a guy who's really {{taking care of a}} situation and really wants to make it better, a guy who's not looking for the joke or is uncomfortable staring <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> or reaching out to hold her hand." [...] This is highlighted in the closing scenes as the two of them drive home from the airport, and Ziva explains her animosity towards Orli Elbaz (Marina Sirtis), the new director of Mossad: Elbaz was the reason her parents split up. She tells Tony, [...] "If it were not for Orli, things would be different. I would be a different person." [...] Tony then takes her hand, and Ziva intertwines their fingers together. Tony replies, [...] "Then I should catch her before she leaves, you know, and thank her." [...] The episode ends with a cliffhanger when an unknown vehicle crashes into them, leaving their fates unknown.|$|E

[...] Dead or Alive 5s overseas producer Peter Garza said the game's revised aesthetic direction: [...] "Dead or Alive is known for its sexiness and high-kicking characters and certain aspects of the physics engine... Those are definitely going to be in Dead or Alive 5 - it's part of the series, it's part of its history and it's part of why people like it. But we're trying to take a bit more of a mature take on it." [...] After the release, the game's director Yohei Shimbori said they were originally [...] "getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality -- to tone down the sexiness of the game, and of the characters." [...] However, the team then changed their decision due to negative feedback from fans who were playing the alpha demo version who demanded bigger breasts. Shimbori said: [...] "That was kind of surprising. There's definitely still room for having sexualized aspects," [...] adding that he [...] "really tries" [...] to take fan feedback into account and to keep an open mind. Hayashi himself made a 180 turn from his previous position. Asked [...] "what would you say to those people who think that the bikini-clad babes in DOA5 are sexist," [...] he said their goal was to create [...] "the cutest chicks in videogames" [...] and so they made a lot of effort to develop an advanced breast physics model that works differently with various types of clothing.
