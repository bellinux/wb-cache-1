5|$|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is {{a nearly}} {{complete}} rewrite {{of the abandoned}} novel Stephen Hero. Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript in <b>a</b> <b>fit</b> of rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A Künstlerroman, Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.|$|E
5|$|According to {{generally}} accepted standards of respect, the national flag {{should never be}} dipped to any person or thing. Care {{should be taken to}} prevent the flag from touching the ground, floor or water beneath it. It should be also secured from being torn off or falling to the ground and it should not be flown outdoors during a heavy rain, blizzard or very strong wind. The flag should never be flown dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in <b>a</b> <b>fit</b> condition to be used, it should be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by cutting it in half so as to separate the colors and then, burning.|$|E

5|$|Attendances {{continued}} to increase during {{the remainder of the}} 1900s, as 121,452 saw the 1908 Scotland v England match. The two Old Firm matches played for the 1909 Scottish Cup Final attracted a total of 131,000. After the second match there was a riot because there was confusion over what would happen next when the second match also ended in a draw. The fans believed that the replay would be played to a conclusion and demanded that a period of extra time be played. The Scottish Cup trophy was withheld as Hampden was not in <b>a</b> <b>fit</b> condition to host a second replay. In response to the riot, the Scottish Football Association decided not to use Hampden as the Scottish Cup Final venue until after the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Aubame {{served as}} foreign {{minister}} under the coalition government, though in early 1963 he was {{dropped from the}} Cabinet for refusing to create a single-party Gabon. To oust Aubame from his legislative seat, M'ba appointed him President of the Supreme Court on 25 February, practically a powerless post. M'ba supporters tried {{to pass a bill}} that declared that a member of parliament could only hold a single role in government. The president claimed that Aubame had resigned from the National Assembly, citing incompatibility with the functions of the assembly. Aubame, however, unexpectedly resigned from the Supreme Court on 10 January 1964, complicating matters for M'ba. In <b>a</b> <b>fit</b> of rage, M'ba dissolved the National Assembly on 21 January 1964. The New York Times speculates that this was due to it not supporting M'ba in Aubame's removal.|$|E
5|$|Corvus is {{associated}} with the myth of Apollo and his lover Coronis the Lapith. Coronis had been unfaithful to Apollo; when he learned this information from a pure white crow, he turned its feathers black in <b>a</b> <b>fit</b> of rage. Another legend associated with Corvus is that a crow stopped on his way to fetch water for Apollo, to eat figs. Instead of telling the truth to Apollo, he lied and said that a snake, Hydra, kept him from the water, while holding a snake in his talons as proof. Apollo, realizing this was a lie, flung the crow (Corvus), cup (Crater), and snake (Hydra) into the sky. He further punished the wayward bird by ensuring it would forever be thirsty, both in real life and in the heavens, where the Cup is just out of reach.|$|E
40|$|ARfit is a {{collection}} of Matlab modules for modeling and analyzing multivariate time series with autoregressive (AR) models. ARfit contains modules for fitting AR models to given time series data, for analyzing eigenmodes of <b>a</b> <b>fitted</b> model, and for simulating AR processes. ARfit estimates the parameters of AR models from given time series data with a stepwise least squares algorithm that is computationally efficient, in particular when the data are high-dimensional. ARfit modules construct approximate confidence intervals for the estimated parameters and compute statistics with which the adequacy of <b>a</b> <b>fitted</b> model can be assessed. Dynamical characteristics of the modeled time series can be examined by means of a decomposition of <b>a</b> <b>fitted</b> AR model into eigenmodes and associated oscillation periods, damping times, and excitations. The ARfit module that performs the eigendecomposition of <b>a</b> <b>fitted</b> model also constructs approximate confidence intervals for the eigenmodes and their oscillation periods and damping times...|$|R

Afterwards, Ros returns to her hotel room, and destroys it in <b>a</b> <b>fit</b> of rage. The next morning, Harry asks Richard Dolby (Robert East) to go after Kachimov, but is refused. However, Harry decides to disobey and go after Kachimov anyway, and promotes Ros to chief of Section D, a position previously held by Adam. Harry calls Lucas North (Richard Armitage) to meet with him for information on Kachimov. Before Lucas arrives, he calls Kachimov to warn him Harry is coming after him. Later, Lucas is appointed a handler from the FSB, and is shocked to find it is his ex-wife, Elizabeta Starkova (Paloma Baeza).|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{it became}} obvious, even to Ney, that cavalry alone were {{achieving}} little.

This assault was directed along {{much the same}} route as the previous heavy cavalry attacks (between Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte). It was halted by a charge of the Household Brigade cavalry led by Uxbridge. The British cavalry were unable, however, to break the French infantry, and fell back with losses from musketry fire.|$|E

Seconds later the father arrives and confronts the mistress, departing to pursue in <b>a</b> <b>fit</b> of anger. Hal and Sue go to the parson's house to be immediately wed. The father is delayed for a short time by car trouble, but quickly arrives before the two are wed. He bursts in and sees his double and both he and Hal laugh.
