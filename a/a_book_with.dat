5|$|Lennon's former {{personal}} assistant Fred Seaman (who was earlier convicted for and admitted stealing from Lennon's personal belongings) has claimed that by this time, however, Lennon had also quietly renounced the counterculture views {{which he had}} helped promote during the 1960s and 1970s and became more aligned with conservatism and was supportive of Ronald Reagan, though whether he had actually aligned to a more conservative world view is disputed. Some commentators noted that Seaman's claims have low credibility, considering {{that he was a}} thief who had abused his position to steal from Lennon, and had also earlier released <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>with</b> dubious allegations about Lennon which had largely been ignored.|$|E
5|$|Bowerman and his athletes' {{philosophy}} and stories were documented by Kenny Moore.

He also was the screenwriter with Robert Towne for Without Limits, a movie that {{told the story of}} Prefontaine and Bowerman. In addition, he was also an actor in Personal Best, a movie with track and field as one of the central themes. Bowerman himself wrote several books on the sport of running including High Performance Training for Track and Field which details coaching instruction for high level competition. He also wrote <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>with</b> a cardiologist called Jogging, which detailed the medical benefits of jogging, to which many credited its exploding popularity.

5|$|In {{this new}} role, he invented the Shive wave machine (also {{known as the}} Shive wave {{generator}}). The wave generator illustrates wave motion using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod ensures the wave takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The motion is analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to the human eye, such as electromagnetic waves on a transmission line. The wave generator could illustrate wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection, and impedance matching. Shive made two educational films in which he demonstrated the machine, Simple Waves and Similarities in Wave Behavior, and wrote <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>with</b> the same name as the latter.|$|E

5|$|The Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year, {{originally}} {{known as}} the Diagram Group Prize for the Oddest Title at the Frankfurt Book Fair, commonly {{known as the}} Diagram Prize for short, is a humorous literary award that is given annually to <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>with</b> an unusual title.
