25|$|Good {{structural}} design {{is important in}} most building design, but particularly for skyscrapers since even a small chance of catastrophic failure is unacceptable given the high price. This presents a paradox to civil engineers: {{the only way to}} assure a lack of failure is to test for all modes of failure, in both the laboratory and the real world. But the only way to know of all modes of failure is to learn from previous failures. Thus, no engineer can be <b>absolutely</b> <b>sure</b> that a given structure will resist all loadings that could cause failure, but can only have large enough margins of safety such that a failure is acceptably unlikely. When buildings do fail, engineers question whether the failure was due to some lack of foresight or due to some unknowable factor.|$|E

Riley was introduced by James Russell Lowell before his performance, and Lowell gave Riley a glowing endorsement to the crowd. Riley's poetry brought both tears and laughter according to The New York Sun. Critic Edmund Clarence Stedman, one of the foremost literary critics of the era, was present and wrote that Riley's dialect poems were the finest he had ever heard, [...] "in which a homely dramatis [...] persona's heart is laid open by subtle indirect, <b>absolutely</b> <b>sure</b> and tender" [...] poetry.

60|$|Jung-Stilling (though {{he wrote}} before modern 'Spiritualism' came in) {{is not a}} very valid authority; there is plenty of better {{evidence}} than his, but Mr. Tylor passes it by, merely remarking that 'modern Europe has kept closely enough to the lines of early philosophy.' Modern Europe has indeed done so, if it explains the supernormal acquisition of knowledge, or the hallucinatory appearance of a distant person to his friend by a theory of wandering 'spirits.' But facts do not cease to be facts because wrong interpretations have been put upon them by savages, by Jung-Stilling, or by anyone else. The real question is, Do such events occur among lower and higher races, beyond explanation by fraud and fortuitous coincidence? We gladly grant that the belief in Animism, when it {{takes the form of a}} theory of 'wandering spirits,' is probably untenable, as it is assuredly of savage origin. But we are not <b>absolutely</b> so <b>sure</b> that in this aspect the theory is not based on actual experiences, not of a normal and ordinary kind. If so, the savage philosophy and its supposed survivals in belief will appear in a new light. And we are inclined to hold that an examination of the mass of evidence to which Mr. Tylor offers here so slight an allusion will at least make it wise to suspend our judgment, not only as to the origins of the savage theory of spirits, but as to the materialistic hypothesis of the absence of a psychical element in man.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We study Schrödinger {{operators}} on {{the real}} line whose potentials are generated by an underlying ergodic subshift over a finite alphabet and a rule that replaces symbols by compactly supported potential pieces. We first develop the standard theory that shows that the spectrum and the spectral type are almost surely constant, and that identifies the almost <b>sure</b> <b>absolutely</b> continuous spectrum with the essential closure of the set of energies with van-ishing Lyapunov exponent. Using results of Damanik-Lenz and Klassert-Lenz-Stollmann, we also show that the spectrum is a Cantor set of zero Lebesgue measure if the subhift satisfies the Boshernitzan condition and the potentials are aperiodic and irreducible. We then study {{the case of the}} Fibonacci subshift in detail and prove results for the local Hausdorff dimension of the spectrum at a given energy in terms {{of the value of the}} associated Fricke-Vogt invari-ant. These results are elucidated for some simple choices of the local potential pieces, such as piecewise constant ones and local point interactions. In the lat-ter special case, our results explain the occurrence of so-called pseudo bands, which have been pointed out in the physics literature. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} not made. Instead Hill wrote and {{directed}} a second biopic, Wild Bill (1995). This too had little critical or commercial success. Hill reflected on his career in 1995:I think every director thinks that he hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, `Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? <b>Sure.</b> <b>Absolutely.</b> But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.Hill admitted his style of films were becoming less fashionable:I admire a lot of what's going on out there, but the oversize kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films are perceived to be vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.Hill continued as one of the three original producers on Alien: Resurrection, although he has stated in several interviews since, that he has had nothing to do with the franchise since Alien 3.|$|R

2500|$|Boulez {{quickly became}} one of the {{philosophical}} leaders of the post-war modernist movement in the arts. As Alex Ross observed: [...] "at all times he seemed <b>absolutely</b> <b>sure</b> of what he was doing.

[...] Many composers of Boulez's generation taught at the International Summer Course for New Music in Darmstadt, Germany, which Boulez attended {{for the first time in}} July 1952. As well as Stockhausen, Boulez was in contact there with other composers who would become significant figures in contemporary music, including Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Bruno Maderna, and Henri Pousseur. According to Scott Burnham, the so-called Darmstadt School composers created a style that, for a time, existed as an antidote to music of nationalist fervour; an international style that could not be co-opted as propaganda in the way that the Nazis had used, for example, the music of Beethoven.|$|E
