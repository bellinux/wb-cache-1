5|$|Along {{with other}} family members, Virginia Clemm and Edgar Allan Poe lived {{together}} {{off and on}} for several years before their marriage. The couple often moved to accommodate Poe's employment, living intermittently in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. A few years after their wedding, Poe was involved in a substantial scandal involving Frances Sargent Osgood and Elizabeth F. Ellet. Rumors about amorous improprieties on her husband's part affected Virginia Poe so much that on her deathbed she claimed that Ellet had murdered her. After her death, her body was eventually placed under the same memorial marker as her husband's in Westminster Hall and Burying Ground in Baltimore, Maryland. Only one image of Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe has been authenticated: <b>a</b> <b>watercolor</b> portrait painted several hours after her death.|$|E

25|$|Very little can be {{said about}} Ba Zaw’s works in spite of his great {{influence}} on Burmese painting because, to date, only about five of his works have surfaced.

It is <b>a</b> <b>watercolor</b> landscape bearing the orange, brown and yellowish tones that one might expect of a painter influenced by J. J. Hilder.

25|$|Eight Bells was the {{outgrowth}} {{of a series}} of oil paintings that Homer made using three wooden panels he found in the cabin of his brother's sloop at Prouts Neck, Maine. On two of the panels Homer painted scenes of mackerel fleets at Prouts Neck, one at dawn and the other at sunset; on the third he painted a grisaille study of the work that inspired Eight Bells, which depicted a ship's officer standing alone, taking an observation with an octant. Several years earlier, Homer had painted <b>a</b> <b>watercolor</b> on his voyage to England that also showed a sailor performing this activity.|$|E

500|$|A notable {{turning point}} for his career came in 1963 when <b>a</b> <b>watercolor</b> (similar to Jazz Giants #1 (1962)) was {{accepted}} for the Art Institute's [...] "2nd Biennial Drawing, Watercolor and Print Exhibition." [...] The exhibit earned him prizes, media attention, {{and the opportunity to}} exhibit his work at other galleries throughout the Midwest. He moved to a large studio in the Hyde Park neighborhood and continued expanding on his work and focusing on musical and sport related themes. His pigment application became rapid, whether he was depicting a jazz musician or a jockey on his horse, allowing the image to express strong movement. Cockfight (1965) shows the evolution of Jarrell's work: intense color bands, swirls, and at times a psychedelic appearance to the bird in focus, a style that became a mainstay in his work.|$|E

It was one fight scene cliche after the other, from slow motion punching to falling into cardboard boxes to rolling down a flight of stairs. What followed was [...] "four punishing, uninterrupted minutes of Louisville Slugger bludgeonings, the gruesome torching of pasty comedian flesh, and a near-beheading by the razor-sharp blades of a pair of hockey skates".

500|$|The film {{received}} an overall positive response from critics and was particularly noted for the theme and for Mamatha Bhukya's performance. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film {{a score of}} 85% based on 26 critic reviews with an average rating of 7/10. Roger Ebert described Bhukya as [...] "a natural star, her eyes and smile illuminating a face of freshness and delight." [...] Writing about Vanaja, he added that [...] "there are the glorious colors of saris and room decorations, the dazzle of dance costumes and the dusty landscape that somehow becomes <b>a</b> <b>watercolor</b> by Edward Lear, with its hills and vistas, its oxen and elephants, its houses that seem part of the land. In this setting, Domalpalli tells his story with tender precision, and never an awkward moment." [...] Ebert listed it {{among the top five}} foreign films of 2007. According to Laura Kern from The New York Times, the film [...] "is a coming-of-age tale that is engrossing, if slightly overlong, and absolutely timeless, unfolding against an antiquated class system that sadly stands firm in rural areas of India to this day." ...|$|E

500|$|Edgar Poe {{was unable}} to {{complete}} studies at the University of Virginia due to gambling debts. He left the university in March 1827 and the already-strained relationship with his foster father, John Allan, grew worse. Poe determined to go to Boston, where he was born. When Poe's biological mother Eliza Poe died, the only object she left him was <b>a</b> <b>watercolor</b> painting of the city, {{on the back of}} which she had written, [...] "For my little son Edgar, who should ever love Boston, the place of his birth, and where his mother found her best and most sympathetic friends." [...] John Allan, a merchant in Richmond, Virginia, refused to give his foster son the $12 for the trip, though it is likely Poe got the money from his foster mother Frances Allan. John Allan was not aware of Poe's decision or whereabouts and, not concerned, wrote [...] "I'm thinking Edgar has gone to Sea to seek his own fortunes". After arriving in Boston in April 1827, Poe served briefly as clerk for a wholesale merchandise warehouse on the waterfront, then as an office clerk and reporter for an obscure newspaper, the Weekly Report. After several weeks, in desperation, he enlisted in the United States Army for a five-year term under the pseudonym [...] "Edgar A. Perry"; he gave his age as 22, though he was only 18, likely because he would have needed parental consent if under 21. He was assigned to the First Regiment of Artillery and stationed at Boston Harbor's Fort Independence.|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} to free up space for Hendrix's lead vocals, further {{reduction}} mixing was completed for [...] "Are You Experienced?" [...] during a session at Olympic on April 4, 1967. With the title track complete, the Experience shifted their focus to the January 11 rough demo of [...] "Third Stone from the Sun". Chandler decided that they should discard the original De Lane Lea tape and record {{a new version of}} the song. During the session, Kramer prepared a reduction mix of [...] "Highway Chile", which made two tracks available for Hendrix's lead guitar and vocal overdubs. Though stereo and mono mixes were completed for the song, Chandler preferred the mono version, which he paired with [...] "The Wind Cries Mary" [...] for release as the group's third UK single. A reduction mix was prepared for [...] "Love or Confusion", and Hendrix took advantage of the newly vacant tracks by adding lead guitar and vocals. A final mix was completed before the end of the session. On April 5, Chandler participated in a mastering session at Rye Muse Studios for [...] "Highway Chile" [...] and [...] "The Wind Cries Mary", during which preparations were made so that Track could begin manufacturing vinyls. On the 10th, he and the Experience returned to Olympic, spending the bulk of the session on editing dialogue segments for [...] "Third Stone from the Sun", which were then slowed down and mixed into the song. Kramer concentrated his efforts on the song's complicated mix: [...] "The song was like <b>a</b> <b>watercolor</b> painting... each track was composed of four, fairly dense composite images." ...|$|E
