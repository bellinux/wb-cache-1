It has a {{population}} of fewer than 50birds and a breeding range of just 9km2 (3.5mi2). It is declining due to egg collection, human disturbance and the loss of coastal wetlands in China. Three other species are categorised as [...] "endangered", with declining populations of less than 10,000 birds. The South Asian black-bellied tern is threatened by habitat loss, egg collecting for food, pollution and predation. In New Zealand, the black-fronted tern is facing a rapid fall in numbers due to predation by introduced mammals and Australian magpies. Disturbance by cattle and sheep and by human activities is also a factor.

2500|$|The Peruvian <b>anchoveta</b> {{fishery is}} now the biggest in the world (10.7 million tonnes in 2004), while the Alaskan pollock fishery in the Bering Sea is the largest single species fishery in the world (3 million tonnes).

[...] Some scientists think this decline in Alaska pollock could repeat the collapse experienced by Atlantic cod, which could have negative consequences for the entire Bering Sea ecosystem. Salmon, halibut, endangered Steller sea lions, fur seals, and humpback whales eat pollock and depend on healthy populations to sustain themselves.|$|E
40|$|The Salton Sea is {{the largest}} inland body of water in California. Prior to 1950 the Sea {{contained}} only four species of fishes, and two of these never exceed two inches in length. The nearest approach to a sportfishery was a snag-fishery for striped mullet which attracted {{a considerable number of}} local residents each year. However, by 1950 even this fishery had started to decline. Situated near one of the greatest centers of population in the United States and in a region of scarcity of inland water resources, the Salton Sea provided a constant challenge to those men interested in the full utilization of resources for the sportsman. Several attempts to introduce game fishes met with failure. The problem was a difficult one, for the waters of the Sea were salty, but the relative amounts of constituent salts were different from those found in the oceans. In addition, the temperature fluctuated greatly. The little that was known about the environmental variables did not provide much hope for establishing a sportfishery. In spite of the difficulties and poor prospects, the California Department of Fish and Game, with encouragement from Harvey A. Hastain (then Fish and Game Commissioner from Brawley) renewed its attempts to establish new species of fishes in 1948. Philip A. Douglas, Willis A. Evans (both in 1948), and John E. Fitch (in 1950) were assigned the tasks of locating, capturing, and transplanting desirable species. Attempts were made to secure anchovies and <b>anchovetas</b> through commercial channels but mortalities were high and there seemed little likelihood for success. Consequently, other sources of stock were investigated. The greatest chance for success seemed to lie in the Gulf of California at San Felipe, Baja California. In May 1950, several thousand fishes of a dozen species were transported to the Salton Sea from San Felipe. Because knowledge was inadequate for making selected plantings, these and subsequent operations were on a "shotgun" basis: all species not undesirable were taken with the hope that one or more might adapt to Salton Sea. By the end of 1951, some 7, 000 fishes from San Felipe had been introduced into the Salton Sea by the California Department of Fish and Game. The success of the 1950 and 1951 plants is now history. In July 1952, Jack Bechtel of the California Department of Fish and Game, took the first bairdiella, a 1 ¾-inch fish, from the Salton Sea. Douglas also reported additional collections of young-of-the-year bairdiella, and the capture of an adult corvina. Indications {{of the success of the}} introduced species gave hope that a fishery might become established. Shortly after these discoveries and after it was certain that bairdiella were reproducing at a remarkable rate, the University of California, Los Angeles, contracted with the California Department of Fish and Game to do research basic to developing a sportfishery in the Sea: Funds were supplied by the Wildlife Conservation Board, and in March 1954, work commenced under the contract W. C. B. 126. This project was continued, on an annual basis, through 1955 and 1956, and research activities were discontinued in the fall of 1957. A laboratory was set up in a rented motel cabin at Fish Springs. Later, as operations expanded, a second cabin was added. Construction and maintenance of research facilities were on a strictly "do-it-yourself" basis. The researchers thus had to double as handymen, and a significant portion of each man's time was occupied by such duties. Help was difficult to get, and more difficult to keep, because of the rigorous conditions for work. From the outset it was obvious that the kinds of information gathered and analyzed by the project would need to be highly restricted. A complete job on a lake of 340 square miles could never be done in a few years' time by a staff of only three full-time researchers. We chose to do those things which we thought would produce information most apt to be useful in future management. In making these decisions, we were ably advised by a committee representing the California Department of Fish and Game and the Wildlife Conservation Board. There were many phases of work which we wished to do but could not because of practical considerations. Sometimes seemingly essential information could be sought only in an indirect or incomplete manner, or not at all, because we lacked manpower. The researchers were forced to cover exceedingly wide areas of investigation, and therefore many of the results are incomplete. We did try, however, to carry the most essential phases to a reasonable conclusion...|$|R

Often, they are marked as [...] "Product of Morocco," [...] which are salted-matured anchovy fillets. Canned anchovetas sold in Peru and other places are extremely similar to the canned sardines widely available in the US, hence the name [...] "Peruvian sardines". Recently new ways of preparation for the anchovetas have been developed in Peru, therefore new products {{are already in the}} international market like <b>anchoveta</b> chicharrones, <b>anchoveta</b> jerky meat, <b>anchoveta</b> paste and <b>anchoveta</b> steaks.|$|E
50|$|The Humboldt current {{produces}} some of {{the most}} successful commercial fisheries in the world. The major catches include: sardines, anchovies, mackerel, hake, and squid. Three major stocks of <b>anchoveta</b> are distributed between 4’S and 42’S within the HCS.  North-Central Peru’s fishery is primarily composed of one stock of <b>anchoveta.</b> Sardines, chub mackerel, and bonito are also common catches, but not as prominent, in Peru. Southern Peru and Northern Chile host a major sardine fishery. Other common stocks include: a second <b>anchoveta</b> stock, jack mackerel, tuna, and swordfish. <b>Anchoveta,</b> jack mackerel, and sardines are the primary commercial stocks in central Chile.|$|E
50|$|Until about 2005 the <b>anchoveta</b> {{was almost}} {{exclusively}} used for making fishmeal. Peru produces {{some of the}} highest quality fishmeal in the world. Since 2005 <b>anchoveta</b> is increasingly used for direct human consumption, as fresh fish, as canned fish or as salted-matured fillets packed in oil. Peruvian canned <b>anchoveta</b> is sold as Peruvian canned sardines. The new use is sometimes called the second <b>anchoveta</b> boom, the first boom being the discovery and subsequent fishery and fishmeal production in the 1960s/70s. The second boom was kick-started by the Peruvian Fish Technology Institute CIP, assisted by FAO. A large scale promotion campaign including by the then-president of Peru Alan Garcia helped to make the <b>anchoveta</b> known to rich and poor alike. Previously it was not considered as food and hardly known among the population. It is now found in supermarkets and served in restaurants. Still, only 1 percent of anchovy catches are used for direct human consumption and 99 percent continue to be reduced to fishmeal and oil.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Anchoveta</b> are {{pelagic fish}} {{found in the}} southeastern Pacific Ocean, and are {{regularly}} caught off the coasts of Peru and Chile. They live for up to 3 years, reaching 20 cm. They first reproduce at about one year age and 10 cm length, whereas they are harvested as early as six months of age and 8 cm length. [...] It was previously thought that <b>anchoveta</b> ate mostly phytoplankton, small zooplankton, and larvae. However, recent work has shown that <b>anchoveta</b> get most of their energy from larger zooplankton, including macrozooplankton (Espinoza & Bertrand 2008, Espinoza et al. 2009). Krill and large copepods {{are the most important}} dietary components.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>anchoveta</b> {{has been}} characterised as [...] "the most heavily {{exploited}} fish in world history". The top yield was 13.1 million tonnes in 1971, but has undergone great fluctuations over time. After {{a period of}} plenty in the late 1960s, the population was greatly reduced by overfishing and the 1972 El Niño event, when warm water drifted over the cold Humboldt Current and lowered {{the depth of the}} thermocline. Nutrient rich waters were then no longer upwelled and phytoplankton production decreased, leaving the <b>anchoveta</b> with a depleted food source. A drastic reduction was also brought about by another strong El Niño in the early 1980s, but production was back up to 12.5 Mt in 1994. Along with the El Niño of 1982-1983, the 1997-1998 El Niño, the strongest on record, caused a loss in population of the <b>anchoveta,</b> negatively impacting fisheries, and, therefore, the economy. In 2008-2012, the annual catches varied between 4.2 to 8.3 million tonnes, which is consistently more than for any other fish species harvested in the wild. In October 2015, an El Niño year, of 3.38 million metric tons of <b>anchoveta</b> surveyed by The Peruvian Marine Research Institute, only 2 million metric tons were of reproductive age; 5 million metric tons are needed to open fisheries. The fishing industry claimed populations were more around 6.8 million metric tons of reproductive age <b>anchoveta,</b> so, despite discrepancies, the Ministry of Production allowed the opening of <b>anchoveta</b> fisheries the second season, but with a quota: 1.1 million metric tons, about half the quota of the first season of the year.|$|E
50|$|The Peruvian <b>anchoveta</b> (Engraulis ringens) is {{a species}} of fish of the anchovy family, Engraulidae. It has yielded greater catches {{than any other single}} wild fish species in the world, with annual harvests varying between 4.2 to 8.3 million tonnes in 2008-2012. Almost all of the {{production}} is used for the fishmeal industry. The Peruvian <b>anchoveta</b> may be the world's most abundant fish species.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>anchoveta</b> {{fishery in}} Peru was booming during the 1960s. In 1970, catches were {{reported}} to exceed 12 million tons per year. This accounted for 20% of the world’s catches. An El Niño event occurred during 1972 and caused the <b>anchoveta</b> population to collapse. However, sardine populations saw {{a dramatic increase in}} the next 15-20 years. Consequently, sardine fisheries grew in this “regime shift”.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anchoveta</b> {{are found}} in more {{recently}} upwelled waters, close to the coast. Sardines, on the other hand, are typically found farther offshore. Seasonal upwelling {{plays a major role}} in the spawning behaviors of both sardines and <b>anchoveta.</b> By spawning at the end of winter, egg and larval survival in greatly enhanced. This is due to the moderate upwelling, which causes lower turbulence, as well as a weakened Ekman drift offshore. These two species experience population shifts related to climate changes and environmental events such as El Nino. This is due to changes in the availability of each species habitat. <b>Anchoveta</b> are an important component in the diets of marine mammals, seabirds, and larger fish. Shifts in these populations ultimately cause a shift in the energy processing within the HCS.|$|E
50|$|The diet {{has been}} {{observed}} to include the Peruvian <b>anchoveta</b> (Engraulis ringens), the Atlantic saury (Scomberesox saurus), the Peruvian silverside (Odontesthes regia) and the mote sculpin (Normanichthys crockeri).|$|E
50|$|It feeds {{mainly on}} the Peruvian <b>anchoveta,</b> Engraulis ringens, and the Peruvian silverside, Odontesthes regia, which thrive in the cold Humboldt Current. The Guanay {{cormorant}} is the main producer of guano.|$|E
50|$|Jack {{mackerel}} (jurel) is {{the second}} largest fishery in the HCS. As with the <b>anchoveta</b> in Peru, this species {{is believed to be}} composed of a single stock. Jurel are a straddling species. This means the species is found both within and outside of the 200-mile economic exclusive zone. Jurel became an important fishery in the 1970s to alleviate the pressure put on the <b>anchoveta</b> stock. During the 1980s, however, the jurel decreased in population size due to poor recruitment and overfishing. Restrictions of jurel fishing were imposed in 1998 which led to regrowth of the population. Since 2002, the jurel population is now under full exploitation.|$|E
50|$|The local fishing {{industry}} along the affected coastline can suffer during long-lasting El Niño events. The world's largest fishery collapsed due to overfishing during the 1972 El Niño Peruvian <b>anchoveta</b> reduction. During the 1982-83 event, jack mackerel and <b>anchoveta</b> populations were reduced, scallops increased in warmer water, but hake followed cooler water down the continental slope, while shrimp and sardines moved southward, so some catches decreased while others increased. Horse mackerel {{have increased in}} the region during warm events. Shifting locations and types of fish due to changing conditions provide challenges for fishing industries. Peruvian sardines have moved during El Niño events to Chilean areas. Other conditions provide further complications, such as the government of Chile in 1991 creating restrictions on the fishing areas for self-employed fishermen and industrial fleets.|$|E
50|$|Normally, the Peruvian current, {{also known}} as the Humboldt Current, brings cold water and large numbers of fish. With the {{development}} of the shoals of <b>anchoveta,</b> the Ancash ports and creeks became commercial fishing centers. During the 1950s, the bay of Chimbote was the top fishing port of the world.|$|E
50|$|However, when warmer waters {{from the}} north, {{such as the}} current of El Niño, bring catastrophic rains to the coast and sea, the shoals of <b>anchoveta</b> disappear, leaving the fishing fleets plants paralyzed, and {{flooding}} rivers cause serious damage to the lands and cities. The cycles of these two sea currents that affect Peru are hard to predict.|$|E
50|$|The diet of the Peruvian booby {{consists}} {{primarily of}} anchovy, particularly Peruvian <b>anchoveta.</b> However, {{there is some}} variation in their diet based on their life stage. As well as anchovy, they are also documented to eat mackerel, depending on the relative abundance of their prey. They rely on the cold, productive waters of the Humboldt Current upwelling system for a consistent food source.|$|E
50|$|It is an {{important}} commercial and game fish, usually caught using purse seine nets, and is sold fresh, frozen, canned, dried, salted, and smoked. With reported landings of almost 2.6 million tonnes, it was {{second only to the}} Peruvian <b>anchoveta</b> as the world's most important capture fish species in 2009.Countries recording large amounts of skipjack catches include the Maldives, France, Spain, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} fishing rights varies {{from country to}} country. In some countries, fishing rights are imposed, or a {{required}} fishing license, while in others, {{they are based on}} the underlying concept of resource rent. In this respect, the definition and calculation of fishing rent enables recognition of the payment that the state should receive for the use of a renewable natural resource: in this case <b>anchoveta.</b> The <b>anchoveta</b> fishery is of particular interest, not only because it ranks among the world’s largest, but because in 2008 Peru passed the Maximum Catch Limit per Vessel Law (Ley de Límites Máximos de Captura por Embarcación), which entails the assignment of resource usage rights. Economic theory holds that the implementation of the resource rent means that it is the maximum possible compared with the open access status that previously existed. If fishery is of open access, there will be no resource rent due to the presence of {{a very large number of}} fishing boats, which leads to the extraction of the resource beyond biologically sustainable levels. Meanwhile, if a fishery falls under a regime of assigned property rights, then the rent generated will be positive and will guarantee a biologically and economically efficient level of extraction.Peruvian fishing regulations stipulate a charge for fishing rights as payment for the use of a resource belonging to the nation. Each boat owner is charged for fishing rights based on a percentage of the price of fishmeal per ton landed. Recently there has been debate as to the relevance of the quantity of fish landed and whether this genuinely reflects the resource rent, given that the implementation of LMCEs have prompted an increase in the value of the <b>anchoveta</b> resource.|$|E
50|$|The Peruvian <b>anchoveta</b> boom created {{wealth in}} the city, but it soon ended due to {{indiscriminate}} fishing that overwhelmed the bio-mass. An earthquake in 1970 damaged to the facilities of the fishing industries, causing unemployment and impoverishment. During this period, the Diocese of Chimbote created the Social Welfare Commission, to organize diverse popular dining places in conjunction with UNICEF. In 2004, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh raised funds for the Chimbote Mission through the Chimbote Foundation.|$|E
50|$|Fisheries and {{agriculture}} were particularly visible failures. PescaPeru aggressively overfished the <b>anchoveta,</b> a fish used primarily as material for fishmeal production {{and a key}} element in the Peruvian sea ecosystem, which resulted in record production {{for a couple of years}} but combined with an El Niño event in 1972 led to an absolute collapse that would take over a decade to partially recover. The badly mismanaged agrarian reform resulted in the creation of thousands of capital-poor and mostly uneducated small farmers whose production and distribution capacities fell substantially short of the pre-reform production. This, coupled with the trade restrictions, led to periodic shortages, rationing, and increased social unrest..|$|E
50|$|Lampara nets {{are used}} for {{capturing}} pelagic fish, those swimming near the water's surface. They are often used in the Mediterranean, the United States, and South Africa to catch sardines. In Argentina they {{are used for}} <b>anchoveta</b> and mackerels and in Japan for sea breams and flying fish. They are used in Australia to catch eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis). In South Florida in the US lampara nets are used to catch ballyhoo (Hemiramphus brasiliensis) and balao (H. balao), which are used as bait fish by anglers. The fishery for opalescent inshore squid (Doryteuthis opalescens) in California became successful after Italian immigrants introduced the lampara net there in 1905.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} fish canning {{industry}} declined, the industrialization of <b>anchoveta</b> fishing peaked. This attracted {{people from all}} over Peru, due to the high wages paid in the fishing industry at the time, fueling Chimbote's suburban growth. The strong migratory wave toward the city increased because of the serious crisis of the countryside in the 1960s, particularly in Ancash, Cajamarca and the northern part of La Libertad Region. The axis of development moved from the Pima cotton, sugarcane, and rice plantations to the large city. In addition, Chimbote was a natural exit channel for the exports of the Santa valley, and a starting point for the entry to the Callejón de Huaylas.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{most of the}} marlin captures in Ecuadorian waters {{today are}} blue and striped marlin, the black marlin brought {{this area of the}} {{southeast}} Pacific to fame in the 1950s, when many fish of over 1000 lb were boated by anglers fishing from Cabo Blanco, a small town in northern Peru, close to the border with Ecuador. The inshore grounds off the high white cliffs became known as 'Marlin Boulevard' for the numbers and size of the black marlin taken there. Greatest of the many granders captured here was the 1560 lb black marlin boated by Texas oilman Alfred C. Glassell, Jr., in August 1953. [...] The Cabo Blanco Fishing Club, where most fishing operations were based, closed down in the late 1960s following a period of political upheaval in Peru. Around the same time, the Peruvian sport fishery also crashed following the overfishing of the primary baitfish, <b>anchoveta.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The dusky dolphin, {{protected}} {{in much of}} its range, is listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN because; [...] "... assessment of global population status is not possible with the currently available estimates of abundance and removals. The subpopulation off Peru has probably been overexploited, but present data do not allow estimation of present decline". Dusky dolphins may fall victim to the small cetacean fisheries of Peru and Chile. The expansion of these fisheries could have started in Peru when the <b>anchoveta</b> fishery collapsed in 1972. Dolphins have also been caught in gill nets in New Zealand, but catches appear to have dropped since the 1970s and 1980s. [...] In Peru, dusky dolphins are killed in large numbers (10.000-15.000 per year) and used as shark bait or for human consumption. The dolphins are also {{thought to have been}} harpooned off South Africa, but the numbers are not considered large.|$|E
5000|$|The Peruvian <b>anchoveta</b> {{fishery is}} now the biggest in the world (10.7 million tonnes in 2004), while the Alaskan pollock fishery in the Bering Sea is the largest single species fishery in the world (3 million tonnes).

50|$|Recruitment of fish is {{regulated}} by larval fish survival. Survival {{is regulated}} by prey abundance, predation, and hydrology. Fish eggs and larvae are eaten by many marine organisms. For example, {{they may be}} fed upon by marine invertebrates, such as copepods, arrow worms, jellyfish, amphipods, marine snails and krill. Because they are so abundant, marine invertebrates inflict high overall mortality rates. Adult fish also prey on fish eggs and larvae. For example, haddock were observed satiating themselves with herring eggs back in 1922. Another study found cod in a herring spawning area with 20,000 herring eggs in their stomachs, and concluded that they could prey on half of the total egg production. Fish also cannibalise their own eggs. For example, separate studies found northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) were responsible for 28% of the mortality in their own egg population, while Peruvian <b>anchoveta</b> were responsible for 10% and South African anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) 70%.|$|E

50|$|Peru has a {{long history}} of direct human {{consumption}} of Engraulis ringens and other sardines, reaching into ancient cultures, including Chimú culture, Paracas culture, Pachacamac, and most importantly the oldest known civilization in the Americas, the Caral-Supe civilization, which was based almost completely on E. ringens consumption. Nonetheless, since the 1950s, the overwhelming destination for captured E. ringens (<b>anchoveta</b> or Peruvian sardine) has been as the principal input for reduction fishery in the production of fishmeal and fish oil, with minuscule quantities destined for direct human consumption. Due to a combination of environmental and regulatory effects, since 2000, the Peruvian catch has ranged from 9.58 million metric tons (MT) to a low of 5.35 million MT, with the reported 2009 catch concluding at 5.35 million MT. E. ringens In recent years, direct human consumption (local and for export) has reached about 110,000 MT (about 2% of catch) due to evangelical promotion of health, environmental, and economic benefits, such as Mistura 2010, coupled with government and NGO activities, e.g. www.anchoveta.info, and private-sector offers from local supermarkets.|$|E
5000|$|Fishing {{boats are}} {{generally}} small, often {{little more than}} 30 m but up to 100 m for a large tuna or whaling ship. Aboard a fish processing vessel, the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs.

One is fishing by nets, such as purse seine, beach seine, lift nets, gillnets, or entangling nets. Another is trawling, including bottom trawl. Hooks and lines are used in methods like long-line fishing and hand-line fishing. Another method is the use of fishing trap.|$|E
