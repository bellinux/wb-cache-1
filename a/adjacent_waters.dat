5|$|At peak intensity, Mitch {{maintained}} maximum sustained {{winds of}} 180mph (285km/h) while off the northern coast of Honduras. Hurricane Hunters reported a minimum barometric pressure of , {{which at the}} time was the lowest in the month of October and tied for the fourth lowest for any Atlantic hurricane. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated a turn to the north, threatening the Yucatán Peninsula. Instead, Mitch turned to the south due to a ridge that was not observed while the storm was active. Land interaction imparted weakening, and the hurricane made landfall on Honduras on October29 with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Turning westward, Mitch slowly weakened over land and maintained deep convection over <b>adjacent</b> <b>waters.</b> After moving across mountainous terrain in Central America, the surface circulation of Mitch dissipated on November1. The next day, the remnants reached the Gulf of Mexico and reorganized into a tropical storm on November3. Mitch accelerated to the northeast ahead of a cold front, moving across the Yucatán Peninsula before striking southwestern Florida on November5. Shortly thereafter, the storm became an extratropical cyclone, which was tracked by the NHC until November9.|$|E

25|$|Hainan {{island has}} rich bio-diversity of {{cetaceans}} {{and is the}} site of studying these in Chinese waters. Many whales such as North Pacific right whales, western gray whales, humpback whales, and blue whales (all of these are almost extinct in Chinese waters) were historically seen in the winter and spring to mate and calve. These gentle giants of the sea had been hunted heavily and were wiped out by Japanese whalers (established whaling stations on various sites on Chinese and Korean coasts including Hainan and Daya Bay). A few Bryde's whales and minke whales may still occur in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>waters</b> along with on Leizhou Peninsula and the Gulf of Tonkin. Smaller species of whale and dolphins, such as short-finned pilot whales and pantropical spotted dolphins, but most notably the endangered Chinese white dolphin. Declared sanctuary for the species extends along the coasts. These dolphins may appear among clearer waters such as vicinity to Sanya.|$|E
25|$|The Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province {{of northwestern}} British Columbia, {{also called the}} Stikine Volcanic Belt, is the most active {{volcanic}} region in Canada. It comprises {{a large number of}} small cinder cones and associated lava plains, and three large, compositionally diverse volcanoes, known as the Level Mountain, the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, and Hoodoo Mountain. In the south the volcanic province is somewhat narrow and crosses diagonally through the northwesterly structural trend of the Coast Mountains. Farther north it is less clearly defined, forming a large arch that swings westward through central Yukon. Volcanoes within the British Columbia portion of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province are disposed along short, northerly trending en-echelon segments which, in the British Columbia portion of the volcanic province, are unmistakably involved with north-trending rift structures including synvolcanic grabens and half-grabens similar to the East African Rift, which extends from the Afar Triple Junction southward across eastern Africa. The Northern Cordilleran rift system formed {{as a result of the}} North American continent being stretched by extensional forces as the Pacific Plate slides northward along the Queen Charlotte Fault to the west, on its way to the Aleutian Trench, which extends along the southern coastline of Alaska and the <b>adjacent</b> <b>waters</b> of northeastern Siberia off the coast of Kamchatka Peninsula. As the continental crust stretches, the near-surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults. Hot basaltic magma rises along these fractures to create passive lava eruptions. The compositions of lavas in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province are mantle-derived alkali olivine basalt, lesser hawaiite and basanite, which form the large shield volcanoes and small cinder cones throughout the volcanic province. Many of them contain inclusions of lherzolite. The large central volcanoes of the volcanic province consist largely of trachyte, pantellerite, and comendite lavas. These lava compositions were formed by fractionation of primary alkali basalt magma in crustal reservoirs. A region of continental rifting, such as the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, would support the development of high-level reservoirs of sufficient size and thermal capacity to sustain prolonged fractionation.|$|E

500|$|Various {{authors have}} {{reported}} the size at maturity as between [...] {{for males and}} [...] for females, reflecting differences between geographical areas. Off northern Canada, females give birth in {{the portion of the}} Laurentian Channel less than [...] deep. As the young grow, they migrate into the deeper parts of the Channel, and eventually a long distance northward over the Grand Banks or the Labrador Shelf, to the deep continental slope. This movement pattern has not been observed in black dogfish inhabiting <b>adjacent</b> <b>waters</b> off western Greenland. A number of anomalous hermaphroditic specimens have been documented.|$|E

From a physical perspective, the effective size of the submarine volcano is considerably large. The effects of other submarine volcanoes along the Pacific Northwest, including Cobb Seamount {{off the coast of}} Washington, can be noticed in the composition and abundance of the tiny floating organisms called plankton up to [...] away from the seamount summit. Because of its similar size, Bowie Seamount most likely has a similar effect on its <b>adjacent</b> <b>waters.</b>|$|E
