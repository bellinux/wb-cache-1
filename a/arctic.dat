5|$|On {{a longer}} timescale, animals like the <b>Arctic</b> hare, <b>Arctic</b> fox, stoat, and rock {{ptarmigan}} have snow camouflage, changing their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey {{in the summer}} to white in the winter; the <b>Arctic</b> fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, <b>Arctic</b> hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round.|$|E
5|$|Save the <b>Arctic</b> is a {{campaign}} to protect the <b>Arctic</b> and an international outcry and a renewed focus concern on oil development in the <b>Arctic,</b> attracting the support of more than five million people.

5|$|Air Greenland wholly owns Hotel <b>Arctic</b> A/S, a {{hotel and}} travel agency based in Ilulissat. Hotel <b>Arctic</b> in turn {{partially}} owns World of Greenland, an outfitter company also based in Ilulissat. The airline also owns Greenland Travel, a package-tour travel agency based in Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|Among animals, {{variable}} snow camouflage {{is a type}} {{of seasonal}} polyphenism with a distinct winter plumage or pelage. It is found in birds such as the rock ptarmigan, lagomorphs such as the <b>Arctic</b> hare, mustelids such as the stoat, and one canid, the <b>Arctic</b> fox. Since these have evolved separately, the similar appearance is due to convergent evolution. Some high <b>Arctic</b> species like the snowy owl and polar bear however remain white all year round.|$|E
5|$|An apex {{predator}} affects {{prey population}} dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). The polar bear is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly <b>Arctic</b> foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge polar bear kills. The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears {{is so close}} that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between <b>Arctic</b> and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, {{where there is no}} major surface predator, <b>Arctic</b> seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The fur of <b>Arctic</b> pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.|$|E

5|$|Hall had {{no special}} {{academic}} background or sailing experience (he was a blacksmith, engraver, then {{owner of a}} Cincinnati newspaper), {{but he was a}} voracious reader with an obsession for the <b>Arctic.</b> After John Franklin's 1845 expedition was lost, Hall's focus was directed toward the <b>Arctic.</b> He was able to launch two expeditions in search of Franklin and his crew; one in 1860–63, and a second in 1864–69. These experiences established him as a seasoned <b>Arctic</b> explorer, and gave him valuable contacts among the Inuit people. The renown he gained eventually allowed him to convince the United States government to fund his third expedition, an attempt on the North Pole.|$|E
5|$|In 1893 Nansen {{had driven}} his ship Fram into the <b>Arctic</b> pack ice off the {{northern}} Siberian coast and {{allowed it to}} drift in the ice towards Greenland, hoping that this route would cross the North Pole. In the event, the drift did not approach the pole, and an attempt by Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen to reach it on foot was likewise unsuccessful. Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own <b>Arctic</b> plans. He reasoned that if he entered the <b>Arctic</b> Ocean via the Bering Strait, well {{to the east of}} Nansen's starting point, his ship would achieve a more northerly drift and pass near or through the pole.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to humans, three primarily terrestrial mammalian species inhabit the archipelago: the <b>Arctic</b> fox, the Svalbard reindeer, and accidentally introduced southern voles, which are {{found only in}} Grumant. Attempts to introduce the <b>Arctic</b> hare and the muskox have both failed. There are fifteen to twenty types of marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, seals, walruses, and polar bears.|$|E

5|$|Operation <b>Arctic</b> Fox (German: Unternehmen Polarfuchs, Russian: Кандалакшская операция) was the codename {{given to}} a World War II {{campaign}} by German and Finnish forces against Soviet Northern Front defenses at Salla, Finland in July 1941. The operation {{was part of the}} larger Operation Silver Fox (Silberfuchs) which aimed to capture the vital port of Murmansk. <b>Arctic</b> Fox was conducted in parallel to Operation Platinum Fox (Platinfuchs) in the far north of Lappland. The principal goal of Operation <b>Arctic</b> Fox was to capture the town of Salla and then to advance in the direction of Kandalaksha (Finnish: Kantalahti) to block the railway route to Murmansk.|$|E

Atlantic puffin, <b>Arctic</b> and common tern, bonxie and <b>Arctic</b> skua, northern fulmar, common guillemot, razorbill, curlew, wheatear, ringed plover and {{great black-backed gull}} all breed on the island, and numerous migratory species have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Research on Svalbard {{centers on}} Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund, the most {{accessible}} {{areas in the}} high <b>Arctic.</b> The treaty grants permission for any nation to conduct research on Svalbard, resulting in the Polish Polar Station and the Chinese <b>Arctic</b> Yellow River Station, plus Russian facilities in Barentsburg. The University Centre in Svalbard in Longyearbyen offers undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate courses to 350 students in various <b>arctic</b> sciences, particularly biology, geology and geophysics. Courses are provided to supplement studies at the mainland universities; there are no tuition fees and courses are held in English, with Norwegian and international students equally represented.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals of}} the far north, like the showshoe and <b>Arctic</b> hares, <b>Arctic</b> fox, stoat, and rock {{ptarmigan}} change their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey summer camouflage to white in the winter; the <b>Arctic</b> fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, <b>Arctic</b> hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round. Since these animals in widely separated groups have evolved separately, the similarity of coloration is due to convergent evolution, on the presumption that natural selection favours a particular coloration in a particular environment.|$|E
5|$|The Jeannette {{expedition}} {{was followed}} by the 1893–1896 <b>Arctic</b> expedition of Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen aboard the Fram, which proved that the <b>Arctic</b> Ocean was a deep oceanic basin, uninterrupted by any significant land masses north of the Eurasian continent.|$|E
5|$|The Shenandoah {{destroyed}} {{one more}} prize in the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, then continued to the Aleutians {{and into the}} Bering Sea and <b>Arctic</b> Ocean, crossing the <b>Arctic</b> Circle on June 19. Continuing then south {{along the coast of}} Alaska the Shenandoah came upon a fleet of Union ships whaling on June 22. She opened continuous fire, destroying a major portion of the Union whaling fleet. Capt. Waddell took aim at a fleeing whaler, Sophia Thornton, and at his signal, the gunner jerked a wrist strap and fired the last two shots of the American Civil War. Shenandoah had so far captured and burned eleven ships of the American whaling fleet while in <b>Arctic</b> waters.|$|E

5|$|<b>Arctic</b> terns {{sometimes}} dip down to {{the surface}} of the water to catch prey close to the surface. They may also chase insects in the air when breeding. It is also thought that <b>Arctic</b> terns may, in spite of their small size, occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targeted—conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Arctic</b> terns usually migrate {{sufficiently}} far offshore {{that they}} are rarely seen from land outside the breeding season.|$|E

5|$|By the 1890s, Svalbard {{had become}} a {{destination}} for <b>Arctic</b> tourism, coal deposits had been found and the islands were {{being used as a}} base for <b>Arctic</b> exploration. The first mining was along Isfjorden by Norwegians in 1899; by 1904, British interests had established themselves in Adventfjorden and started the first all-year operations. Production in Longyearbyen, by American interests, started in 1908; and Store Norske established itself in 1916, as did other Norwegian interests during the war, in part by buying American interests.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change from}} {{global warming is}} leading to a {{mismatch}} between the seasonal coat coloration of <b>arctic</b> animals such as snowshoe hares with the increasingly snow-free landscape.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{scientists}} have {{hypothesized that the}} jet stream will gradually weaken {{as a result of}} global warming. Trends such as <b>Arctic</b> sea ice decline, reduced snow cover, evapotranspiration patterns, and other weather anomalies are expected to make the <b>Arctic</b> heat up faster than other parts of the globe. This in turn reduces the temperature gradient that drives jet stream winds, causing the jet stream to become weaker and more variable in its course.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1871, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant had named Hall as overall {{commander}} of the expedition, and he was being referred to as Captain. Though Hall had abundant <b>Arctic</b> experience, he had no sailing experience, and so the title was purely honorary. In selecting the officers and seamen, Hall relied heavily on whalers with experience in the <b>Arctic.</b> This was markedly different from the polar expeditions of the British Admiralty, which tended to use naval officers and highly disciplined crews.|$|E

5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is well adapted for hunting <b>Arctic</b> seals and walruses, particularly pups. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Other terrestrial predators include cougars, brown hyenas and various species of canids, which mostly target the young. Pinnipeds lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. Some species are capable of inflicting damaging wounds on their attackers with their sharp canines—an adult walrus is capable of killing polar bears. When out at sea, northern elephant seals dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas and white sharks. In the Antarctic, which lacks terrestrial predators, pinniped species spend more time on the ice than their <b>Arctic</b> counterparts. <b>Arctic</b> seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out, and rarely defecate on the ice. Ringed seals build dens underneath fast ice for protection.|$|E
