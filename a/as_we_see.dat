5|$|In the 12th century {{religious}} hermits started inhabiting {{the caves}} on Mount Carmel, {{and in the}} 13th century they formed a new Catholic monastic order, the Carmelites. Under Muslim rule, the church which they had built on Mount Carmel {{was turned into a}} mosque, later becoming a hospital. In the 19th century, it was restored as a Carmelite monastery, the Stella Maris Monastery. The altar of the church <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> it today, stands over a cave associated with Prophet Elijah.|$|E
5|$|Among Denmark's most {{successful}} contemporary photographers are Jacob Aue Sobol, who gained recognition for captivating portraits of his Greenlandic girlfriend, and Per Bak Jensen, who {{introduced a new}} perspective to modern landscape photography. Press photography has prospered too under award-winning contributors such as Jan Grarup and Claus Bjørn Larsen, who have covered wars and conflicts of global importance over the past 20 years. Photography is an interesting hobby {{for most of the}} people in the world. In 1944, I took a photo of a car from my digital camera and yesterday, I found that photo. Travelling back in time, photography wasn’t as simple as ‘smile and click’ <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> today. Back in 1820s, early cameras would take several hours to actually capture a film! Technology is great, isn’t it? The first every digital camera to be created was in December 1975. It was developed by an engineer in Kodak Company and took 23 seconds to create first photograph. The camera only recorded black and white photographs of 0.1 mega pixels. The camera weighed 8 pounds.|$|E

25|$|The “history” of Doro’s {{reproductive}} {{colonies in}} which he calls “seed villages,” embodies the rationales of Western modernity. Doro also poses these “seed villages” as alternatives to Western modernity, more specifically slavery and colonization. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>see,</b> the moment Anyanwu agrees to Doro’s continuation of his colonial project, she agrees to a patriarchal system of governance that controls not only her capacity to reproduce, but also whomever Doro chooses. This control of women’s reproduction is not dissimilar from the very same patriarchal governances of reproduction in slavery and colonization. After her agreement, Doro and Anyanwu’s relationship is described in a master-slave/, colonizer/colonized dialectic. In this instance, colonization is linked to patriarchal desires, particularly those of control over reproduction.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} at least two glacial periods {{in the history of the}} {{mountains}} and they were glaciated as little as 2,000 years ago. During the Last ice age, the Bale Mountains were one of the most extensively glaciated areas in present day Ethiopia, with a total area of ice in Bale of approximately 180km2. There was a 30km2 ice cap around the peak of Tulu Dimtu (the second highest mountain in Ethiopia) on the Sanetti Plateau and individual glaciers of considerable thickness reached down to 3,200 meters. As a consequence, the landscape <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> it today is the lava outpourings much modified by over 20 million years of erosion by water, wind and ice.|$|E
25|$|In general <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> in {{the graph}} below, {{high gas prices}} are {{typically}} associated to low storage periods. Usually when prices are high during {{the early months of}} the refill season (April–October), many users of storage adopt a wait and see attitude. They limit their gas intake in anticipation that the prices will drop before the heating season begins (November–March). However, when that decrease does not occur, they are forced to buy natural gas at high prices. This is particularly true for Local Distribution and other operators who rely on storage to meet the seasonal demand for their customers. On the other hand, other storage users, who use storage as a marketing tool (hedging or speculating) will hold off storing a lot of gas when the prices are high.|$|E

25|$|We {{believe that}} the {{political}} reform is the true and natural gateway for all other kinds of reform. We have announced our acceptance of democracy that acknowledges political pluralism, the peaceful rotation {{of power and the}} fact that the nation is the source of all powers. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> it, political reform includes the termination of the state of emergency, restoring public freedoms, including the right to establish political parties, whatever their tendencies may be, and the freedom of the press, freedom of criticism and thought, freedom of peaceful demonstrations, freedom of assembly, etc. It also includes the dismantling of all exceptional courts and the annulment of all exceptional laws, establishing the independence of the judiciary, enabling the judiciary to fully and truly supervise general elections so as to ensure that they authentically express people's will, removing all obstacles that restrict the functioning of civil society organizations, etc.|$|E
25|$|The video {{begins with}} Pink World's main character, Artemus, shown in his bedroom, {{looking out the}} window at a {{helicopter}} that follows him throughout {{the first half of the}} video. He is then shown holding a small globe that is glowing red. His mother enters and puts the globe under his bed and tucks him in. With the helicopter following him, the scene changes to a large institutional setting filled with empty beds. He appears sad and confused as his mother washes him. He sees a vision of crowds of people in the Barrier (foreshadowing the scene in the second part of the video). The first part of the video ends <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> Artemus again looking out of his bedroom window, the institution and the crowds in the Barrier apparently a vision. He climbs back into bed. The plot in the first part of the video is not linear. Scenes are interspersed with flashbacks and future visions.|$|E
25|$|We do {{not believe}} that Congress {{contemplated}} that such a taxpayer, without risking criminal prosecution, could ignore the duties imposed upon him by the Internal Revenue Code and refuse to utilize the mechanisms provided by Congress to present his claims of invalidity to the courts and to abide by their decisions. There is no doubt that Cheek, from year to year, was free to pay the tax that the law purported to require, file for a refund and, if denied, present his claims of invalidity, constitutional or otherwise, to the courts. See 26 U.S.C. 7422. Also, without paying the tax, he could have challenged claims of tax deficiencies in the Tax Court, 6213, with the right to appeal to a higher court if unsuccessful. 7482(a)(1). Cheek took neither course in some years, and, when he did, was unwilling to accept the outcome. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> it, he is in no position to claim that his good-faith belief about the validity of the Internal Revenue Code negates willfulness or provides a defense to criminal prosecution under 7201 and 7203. Of course, Cheek was free in this very case to present his claims of invalidity and have them adjudicated, but, like defendants in criminal cases in other contexts who “willfully” refuse to comply with the duties placed upon them by the law, he must take the risk of being wrong.|$|E

25|$|UNAMSIL was {{eventually}} formed and deployed in 1999, authorised under a Chapter VII mandate, {{it was meant}} to enforce the Lome agreements. However, violence would continue. From the outset the RUF was beyond uncooperative and once the ECOMOG contingent withdrew, the RUF attacked UN forces, eventually taking hundreds hostage. This led to an unexpected backlash from the international community that the RUF did not anticipate. Its leadership had expected the international community to cut and run, as it had done in Somalia and earlier when UNOMSIL fled Freetown. Instead, with British support, an aggressive campaign was waged against the RUF. UNAMSIL's mandate was expanded and its manpower enlarged. By late 2000 and early 2001 the RUF's military strength had been severely depleted. Thus the Abuja agreements were signed and UNAMSIL fulfilled its mandate in December 2005. While Sierra Leone is at peace today and the UN's mission can be deemed a success, {{the way in which the}} situation developed illustrates Shearer's point: that a consent-based approach focused on negotiation that encompasses all belligerents' interest may not necessarily lead to success. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>see,</b> fighting continued despite the presence of UNOMSIL. Indeed, even after UNOMSIL was replaced by a more robust force under a Chapter VII mandate in the form of UNAMSIL the violence continued. It was not until the British intervened militarily and substantially degraded the RUF's capability to sustain the conflict, as Executive Outcomes had done years prior, did the RUF finally come to the negotiating table and allow for the establishment of peace.|$|E
500|$|Often esoteric and conceptual, Meshuggah's lyrics explore themes such as existentialism. Allmusic {{describes}} Destroy Erase Improves lyrical {{focus as}} [...] "the integration of machines with organisms as humanity's next logical evolutionary step".

Separated, {{one thing at}} a time / The harder we stare the more complete the disintegration." [...] Haake explains that Catch Thirtythrees cover, title and lyrics deal with [...] "the paradoxes /negations /contradictions of life and death (<b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> it in our finest moments of unrestrained metaphoric interpretation)".|$|E
500|$|Chapter VI {{begins by}} saying the next three {{chapters}} will address possible objections to the theory, the first being that often no intermediate forms between closely related species are found, though the theory implies such forms must have existed. As Darwin noted, [...] "Firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? [...] Why is not all nature in confusion, instead of the species being, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> them, well defined?" [...] Darwin attributed this to the competition between different forms, combined with {{the small number of}} individuals of intermediate forms, often leading to extinction of such forms. This difficulty can be referred to as the absence or rarity of transitional varieties in habitat space.|$|E

[...] Additionally, [...] "Never Marry a Mexican" [...] is characterized by the consistent use of interior monologue.

500|$|With S.H.I.E.L.D. being {{announced}} {{as a legitimate}} organization again, after working in secret {{since the end of}} the series' first season, executive producer Jed Whedon said that the reaction to this would be mixed, as [...] "there are people who, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> with the senator, are outspoken against Inhumans and will be against any form of protection for them. There are also people who are afraid. The idea of bringing S.H.I.E.L.D. back into the light is to ease their fears. So it’s going to be mixed." [...] Elaborating on this fear of Inhumans, Whedon said, [...] "the fun part about a genre TV show is you can speak in metaphor. There is a lot of fear of the other in our world right now. We get to do that with humans and Inhumans. We get to tackle those issues head-on without ever really talking about them." ...|$|E

[...] He explains that [...] "n just a few scenes... juice up the slumping sophomore drama" [...] and her [...] "live-wire performance turned Chapter 5 into this season's strongest episode yet."

[...] However, he condemn it for only having the drama {{and a couple}} of scenes from the Twilight movie in common. Goodman described the music video as a [...] "soap opera tale of a young couple struggling through a breakup, and revisiting all their good times in the process." [...] David Greenwald of Billboard criticized the video for looking [...] "more like a denim brand's lookbook than a peek at the vampire franchise's fourth film."

500|$|An {{unusually large}} amount of in-camera effects {{were used for the}} pilot in place of {{computer}} generated imagery, including [...] "upside-down day"; shots of Haller using his abilities, where multiple takes of debris were filmed in controlled camera movements and then overlayed on shots of Stevens acting on his own; a montage that appears as a single camera movement, pulling [...] "back in slow motion <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> David Haller’s childhood progress"; and a one-shot action sequence—actually filmed in two shots that were later connected with visual effects—that saw the camera mounted on a cable and run down a hill side. Hawley admitted {{that it would be a}} challenge for the series' other directors to maintain this quality of visuals with much less time to film each episode: Hawley had 21 days to film the pilot, but the subsequent episodes were only scheduled 8 days of filming each. Some of these shoots ultimately had to be extended to 10 or 11 days filming to meet Hawley's vision, which he said were [...] "not good calls to have but what are you going to do? It’s a huge show." [...] Keller felt that each episode in the season was noticeably different from the others, calling the series a uniquely [...] "director-driven show.
