She then becomes concerned over Vicki's much older boyfriend Tommy Grant (Robert Cavanah), and exposes him as a liar. At this point, Den returns intent on securing her forgiveness. However, she does not succumb to his charm offensive, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>as</b> a demonstration of his affection he confides in her of his plans to bankrupt the Mitchell family and take control of The Queen Victoria public house, declaring that he can't do it without her. She relents, but warns if he ever cheats again she will kill him. Together, they scam the Mitchell family out of their holdings and move into the Vic on Christmas Day, 2004.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} version, the Enterprise visits Naterra and meets the planet's leader, Zxolar, who {{is concerned that}} Captain Kirk is an alien called Komether who is due to return within twenty days to destroy their world. Zxolar suddenly collapses and Doctor McCoy tries to help him but an energy surrounds the doctor's head and he runs at a wall and disappears. The landing party search for McCoy {{but to no avail}} and Zxolar is beamed to the Enterprise. Doctor Chapel attempts to help him but the energy appears around her and she passes out. Xon and Kirk discuss the energy and realize it wants Zxolar to die as it has attacked anyone who helps him. The pair beam back down the planet to investigate the palace they met Zxolar in and discover an archive which shows them {{the original}} agreement made by six philosophers, including a much younger Zxolar, and Komether a thousand years earlier. They note one of the philosophers is Zxolar and the Komether is the energy being which attacked the two doctors. As in the later version used on Star Trek: The Next Generation, the agreement was that the being would correct the pollution of the planet in return for ownership of the planet a thousand years later. Xon and Kirk decide to move Zxolan to a life support table and ask for other volunteers as it is apparent that Komether will attack them as they attempt to save him. Scotty, Sulu and Chekov all volunteer as well, and the alien disables each of them as they move Zxolar. It is only because of Xon's strength as he is being attacked that they manage to attach Zxolar to a life support machine and his life signs immediately improve. Zxolar tells Kirk about the contract, who retrieves it from the planet's surface and challenges it. Komethar appears and agrees to a trial with the Enterprises computer acting as an impartial judge. Kirk realises that Komethar was created by the six philosophers <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>as</b> the last remaining, Zxolar is in control of it. Zxolar manages to defeat the creature using his will and releases the stunned crewmen. He finds that McCoy was trapped in the wall itself and releases him too, the Enterprise departing shortly thereafter.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{canonical}} gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus Christ spent 40 days fasting in the desert, where he endured temptation by Satan. Lent originated as a mirroring of this, fasting 40 days as preparation for Easter. Every Sunday {{was seen as}} a commemoration of the Sunday of Christ's resurrection <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>as</b> a feast day on which fasting was inappropriate. Accordingly, Christians fasted from Monday to Saturday (six days) during six weeks and from Wednesday to Saturday (four days) in the preceding week, thus making up the number of 40 days. Orthodox Christians do this 40 days in a row.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposition}} badly {{wanted to}} get its story out {{to the rest of}} the world <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>as</b> soon as they acquired a territorial base in Benghazi, foreign reporters were able to join them. These reporters were, to a large extent, free to travel wherever and to talk to whomever they wished within opposition-controlled areas. This proximity and relative freedom of access to the opposition side of events, combined with reporters' natural sympathies for what they see as genuine popular rebellions against despotic regimes, undoubtedly aided the opposition and hurt the Gaddafi-government in getting their respective messages out.|$|E
25|$|On Jefferson's {{isolated}} mountaintop, sex {{took place}} {{as part of}} a hierarchy that everyone involved understood. Jefferson, and those of his class, did not share our current understanding of sexual morality. Sally Hemings was his servant, and had little power. She was dependent economically, though this does not mean her feelings were irrelevant. But it does mean that he had extraordinary power, and she very little, <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>as</b> his concubine, she had probably replicated her mother's relationship with Jefferson's father-in-law; for she was, in fact, Jefferson's late wife's half-sister, and I have described the Hemings family as a parallel, subordinate family to the all-white Jeffersons.|$|E

25|$|Barillas {{was unique}} among all liberal presidents of Guatemala between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his {{successor}} peacefully. When election time approached, he sent {{for the three}} Liberal candidates to ask them what their government plan would be. Satisfied with the response of Reyna Barrios, Barillas made sure a huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicapán Indigenous people {{came down from the}} mountains to vote for the general. The official agents did their job: Reyna was elected president <b>and,</b> <b>so</b> <b>as</b> not to offend the losing candidates, Barillas gave them checks to cover the costs of their presidential campaigns. Reyna Barrios of course received nothing, but he went on to become President on March 15, 1892.|$|E
25|$|However, on 26 February 2009, the BBC Trust, the BBC's own Editorial Watchdog, {{upheld a}} {{complaint}} from {{a member of}} the public and released a report criticising the Newsnight programme for significant failings in the conduct of this interview, stating that the interview had not upheld the BBC's guidelines on fairness and impartiality, that Senator Walker had been misquoted, that Walker's earlier comments had been edited in a way as to misrepresent what Senator Walker had said <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>as</b> to mislead the audience and that the correction had not gone far enough in remedying the unfair implications that the quotes had suggested. Frank Walker stated that he was very happy with the outcome, and that he felt vindicated for what he felt was the low-point of his political career.|$|E
25|$|There {{will also}} be {{extensive}} landscaping works around the station. The southern entrance at Station Street will form the main drop-off area for cars and taxis, allowing the existing drop-off area to be enclosed within the concourse.

25|$|In 1886, certain {{leaders of}} the Arya Samaj held {{discussion}} and debate with Ghulam Ahmad about the truthfulness of Islam {{and asked for a}} sign to prove that Islam was a living religion. In order to dedicate special prayers for this purpose <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>as</b> to seek further divine guidance, Ghulam Ahmad travelled to Hoshiarpur upon what he claimed was divine instruction. Here, he spent forty days in seclusion, a practice known as chilla-nashini. He travelled accompanied by three companions to the small two-storied house of one of his followers and was left alone in a room where his companions would bring him food and leave without speaking to him as he prayed and contemplated. He only left the house on Fridays and used an abandoned mosque for Jumu'ah (Friday prayers). It is during this period that he declared God had given him the glad tidings of an illustrious son.|$|E
25|$|Upon its {{formation}} the 1st Armoured Division was organised along British {{lines and}} was authorised six armoured regiments and an armoured car regiment. While these regiments began forming in mid-1941 {{they were not}} issued with any tanks as it was planned to equip the division and finalise its training when it deployed to the Middle East between December 1941 and March 1942. Following the outbreak {{of war in the}} Pacific {{the decision was made to}} retain the division in Australia. At this stage, there were still not enough tanks available to complete the division's equipment requirements, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>as</b> an interim solution the division's armoured regiments were equipped with Bren Carriers until sufficient tanks arrived. These were replaced by newly arrived M3 Grant medium tanks in April and May 1942, and the division completed its training in northern New South Wales, before moving to Western Australia in 1943 where it was tasked with defending against a possible Japanese invasion.|$|E
25|$|Meetings to {{organize}} the march began in early January at Rodwell's apartment in 350 Bleecker Street. At first there was difficulty getting {{some of the major}} New York City organizations like Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) to send representatives. Craig Rodwell and his partner Fred Sargeant, Ellen Broidy, Michael Brown, Marty Nixon, and Foster Gunnison of Mattachine made up the core group of the CSLD Umbrella Committee (CSLDUC). For initial funding, Gunnison served as treasurer and sought donations from the national homophile organizations and sponsors, while Sargeant solicited donations via the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop customer mailing list and Nixon worked to gain financial support from GLF in his position as treasurer for that organization. Other mainstays of the organizing committee were Judy Miller, Jack Waluska, Steve Gerrie and Brenda Howard of GLF. Believing that more people would turn out for the march on a Sunday, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>as</b> to mark the date of the start of the Stonewall uprising, the CSLDUC scheduled the date for the first march for Sunday, June 28, 1970. With Dick Leitsch's replacement as president of Mattachine NY by Michael Kotis in April 1970, opposition to the march by Mattachine ended.|$|E

25|$|Volcanoes {{can cause}} {{widespread}} destruction and consequent disaster in several ways. The effects include the volcanic eruption itself that may cause harm following {{the explosion of}} the volcano or falling rocks. Secondly, lava may be produced during the eruption of a volcano, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>as</b> it leaves the volcano the lava destroys many buildings, plants and animals due to its extreme heat. Thirdly, volcanic ash, generally meaning the cooled ash, may form a cloud, and settle thickly in nearby locations. When mixed with water this forms a concrete-like material. In sufficient quantities, ash may cause roofs to collapse under its weight but even small quantities will harm humans if inhaled. Since the ash has the consistency of ground glass it causes abrasion damage to moving parts such as engines. The main killer of humans in the immediate surroundings of a volcanic eruption is the pyroclastic flows, which consist of a cloud of hot volcanic ash which builds up in the air above the volcano and rushes down the slopes when the eruption no longer supports the lifting of the gases. It is believed that Pompeii was destroyed by a pyroclastic flow. A lahar is a volcanic mudflow or landslide. The 1953 Tangiwai disaster was caused by a lahar, as was the 1985 Armero tragedy in which the town of Armero was buried and an estimated 23,000 people were killed.|$|E
25|$|The {{speed of}} light is a {{dimensional}} quantity <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>as</b> has been emphasized in this context by João Magueijo, it cannot be measured. Measurable quantities in physics are, without exception, dimensionless, although they are often constructed as ratios of dimensional quantities. For example, when {{the height of a}} mountain is measured, what is really measured is the ratio of its height to the length of a meter stick. The conventional SI system of units is based on seven basic dimensional quantities, namely distance, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity. These units are defined to be independent and so cannot be described in terms of each other. As an alternative to using a particular system of units, one can reduce all measurements to dimensionless quantities expressed in terms of ratios between the quantities being measured and various fundamental constants such as Newton's constant, the {{speed of light}} and Planck's constant; physicists can define at least 26 dimensionless constants which can be expressed in terms of these sorts of ratios and which are currently thought to be independent of one another. By manipulating the basic dimensional constants one can also construct the Planck time, Planck length and Planck energy which make a good system of units for expressing dimensional measurements, known as Planck units.|$|E
