40|$|EU {{member states}} often use speedy (accelerated) asylum {{procedures}} to examine asylum claims that are deemed manifestly unfounded. Speedy asylum procedures should generally {{be considered to}} be {{in the interest of the}} asylum applicant and the state. Accelerated procedures have however been criticised for not being fair and resulting in inaccurate decisions. EU legislation allows the use of an <b>accelerated</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>procedure</b> in any asylum case and does not set minimum time limits for (certain stages) of asylum procedures. This does mean however that EU member states are completely free to design speedy asylum procedures. This article argues that the EU right to an effective remedy, laid down in article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter), and the principle of effectiveness limit member states' discretion to set time limits for asylum procedures. It is contended that EU law is violated if the speed of the proceedings undermines the effectiveness of the EU prohibition of refoulement and/or the right to asylum, guaranteed by articles 18 and 19 of the Charter. Furthermore, short time limits are contrary to EU law if they render the exercise of the EU right to an effective remedy, or other procedural rights guaranteed by the Asylum Procedures Directive, impossible or excessively difficult. This is based on an analysis of EU legislation, the case law of the Court of Justice, and sources of inspiration of EU fundamental rights, in particular, the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. It is shown that time limits in asylum procedures should be reasonable and proportionate in general as well as in the individual asylum case. This article explores which factors should be taken into account when assessing time limits in the light of the EU right to an effective remedy and the principle of effectiveness in a particular case. © The Author (2014).

5000|$|In the 1990s, {{following}} {{the resolution of}} the east-west conflict, there were many crises and wars throughout Europe and the world. For example, there was a war in the former Yugoslavia, and a border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea, as well as between Mali and Burkina Faso. In Burundi there was a civil war, {{as well as in the}} Republic of Congo, Senegal and Zimbabwe. By 1992, the number of refugees had risen to 440,000. As a consequence, there was a wave of arson attacks on the homes of the foreigners (in Hoyerswerda, Rostock-Lichtenhagen, Mölln and Solingen). Voters became more willing to accept extreme-right political parties. As a reaction to this crisis, asylum policy in Germany was established with the introduction into the Grundgesetz of articles tackling this problem. Clause 16a was changed: a person coming from a [...] "safe country of origin" [...] or a [...] "safe third country" [...] can no longer claim political asylum on account of feeling in danger. In 1993, the law to give benefits for asylum seekers was introduced. It stated, amongst other things, that foreigners who from the start have been dependent on government aid, were to receive a lower amount than Germans and any others of equal status. The amount fell by almost 40%, to a smaller amount than the unemployment benefit (Arbeitslosengeld II LINK). In 1997 the Dublin convention was concluded, through which the German refugee policy was secured according to the European Community Law. Since then, in Germany's neighbouring countries, more specifically known as [...] "safe third countries", the expected number of asylum seekers sank steadily, from roughly 320,000 in 1993 to 28,018 in 2008. It was decided that asylum seekers would only have the chance of a favourable decision if they arrive by air. As a part of the [...] "Asylum Compromise", transient asylum seekers, who have landed in Germany and are still within the transit area, will be subject to <b>accelerated</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>procedures.</b> According to the rules, the decision on their application must be made within 2 days; the objection period is only 3 days. This means that the number of cases is kept low, which through the directive [...] "2001/51 / EU, airlines", members of third countries (such as citizens of countries who are not members of the EU) allow entry into an EU country without a valid travel document, must pay a fine. This fine, since 2001, in Europe is as high as between 3,000 and 5,000 euros per passenger travelling illegally.|$|R

30|$|In Denmark and Greece, {{policies}} concerning housing {{are made}} centrally {{at the nation}} state level.

It contracts the Danish Red Cross or communes to manage refugee accommodation. In Greece, administrative responsibilities appear to be complicated. Particularly since 2013, it has implemented EU laws creating a stronger legal framework concerning reception and care. The Ministries of Citizen Protection, Migration Policy, and Labour, together with the Greek navy and military are responsible for the management of housing. Often one of these runs the camps directly, or contracts are given to NGOs, which are financed through the European Refugee Fund (ERF). UNHCR and the EU have also initiated an accommodation project, in support of the Greek authorities’ efforts to expand reception capacity since 2014.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Home {{narratives}} are particular sub-narratives {{found in}} stories told by African asylum seekers in Belgium, in which {{details of the}} situation in their home society, the conflict from which they fled, and their own position in that conflict are being sketched and documented. Despite the fact that they contain sometimes crucial elements for an understanding of their motives to apply for asylum, they are hardly ever taken into account in the <b>asylum</b> <b>procedure.</b> The story told by asylum seekers is molded into a text-ideology in which home narratives are seen as>noise=. In this paper, we first touch upon the issue of linguistic-communicative resources: the>broken = varieties of European languages in which asylum seekers tell their stories. Next, the structure and functions of home narratives are explored, with special emphasis on their role as contextualizing, localizing discourse. Finally, the role of such narratives in the <b>asylum</b> <b>procedure</b> is discussed, and the contrast in contextualizing directions between home narratives and text trajectories in the procedure is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{implementation}} of the <b>Asylum</b> <b>procedure</b> directive (2005 / 85 /EC) and the Asylum Qualification Directive (2004 / 83 /EC). The implementation is based on the officials examining asylum applications at the Migration Board in Malmö. Ten officials examining asylum applications have been interviewed. The aim is {{to see if there are}} any implementation problems regarding these two directives. This will in turn have an effect on the Europeanization of asylum policy. Implementation theory is used to study factors that have an effect on implementation and the theory of street- level bureaucrats is also used to study their discretion. The result is that the Asylum Qualification Directive had a larger impact on the asylum examinations than the <b>Asylum</b> <b>Procedures</b> Directive. Different forms of status categories are now granted together with residence permit. The implementation of this directive has therefore a positive impact on the Europeanization of the asylum policy in Sweden.   Key words: Implementation, Common European asylum system, EU- directives, Migration Boar...|$|R

40|$|Adequate {{and fair}} <b>asylum</b> <b>procedures</b> are a {{precondition}} for the effective exercise of rights granted to asylum applicants, in particular the right not be expelled to a country where they face {{the risk of being}} subjected to human rights violations. In 1999 the EU Member States decided to work towards a Common European Asylum System. In this context the Procedures Directive was adopted in 2005. This directive provides for important procedural guarantees for asylum applicants, but also leaves much discretion to the EU Member States to design their <b>asylum</b> <b>procedures.</b> An important result of the adoption of the Procedures Directive is that <b>asylum</b> <b>procedures</b> now fall within the reach of the Charter and general principles of EU law. This book examines the meaning of the EU right to an effective remedy for the legality and the interpretation of the Procedures Directive. For this purpose the EU Courts’ case-law on the EU right to an effective remedy is examined. The interpretation of the EU right to an effective remedy is inspired by international law. Therefore this book also extensively discusses the ECtHR’s case-law as well as the views of the UNHCR and UN Committees concerning procedural rights for asylum applicants. The result of this exercise is a set of procedural standards with regard to several key issues of asylum procedures: the right to remain on the territory of the Member State, the right to be heard, the standard and burden of proof and evidentiary assessment, judicial review of the establishment and qualification of the facts and the use of secret evidence.
