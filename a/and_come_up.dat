5|$|The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, today {{known as}} DARPA) {{was formed in}} 1958 by President Dwight Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, in {{reaction}} to Soviet rocketry advances. US efforts had suffered from massive duplication of effort between the Army, Air Force, and Navy, {{and seemed to be}} accomplishing little in comparison to the Soviets. ARPA was initially handed the mission of overseeing all of these efforts. As the problems with Zeus became clear, McElroy also asked ARPA to consider the antimissile problem <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with other solutions. The resulting Project Defender was extremely broad in scope, considering everything from minor Zeus system upgrades to far-out concepts like antigravity and the recently invented laser.|$|E

25|$|In 2002 the World Monuments Fund placed Stowe House on its List of Most Endangered Sites. The {{school had}} done {{its best to}} keep the house in good repair, {{including}} re-roofing the State Dining Room in 1990, repair of the north elevation of the West Pavilion in 1992 and the repair of the Marble Saloon's oculus skylight in 1994. On taking over ownership {{of the house in}} 1997, the Stowe House Preservation Trust commissioned a survey in order to scope the problem <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with a restoration plan. The result was a six-phase plan, starting with the most urgent work. The estimated cost in 2002 for all six phases was nearly £40 million.|$|E
25|$|Under the City of Rahway's form of government, all {{executive}} and administrative authority is vested {{in the office}} of the mayor, who appoints the Business Administrator and department directors. The Business Administrator develops an annual budget for the city, manages the city's departments and oversees its employees. This form of government gives citizens a centralized line of authority for the efficient management of the city's business. There are nine members of the Municipal Council, all elected to four-year terms of office. Six members of the council are elected from each of six wards. The other three members are elected to represent the entire city at large, <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> for election at the same time as the mayor two years after the ward seats are up for election.|$|E
25|$|The {{defensive}} buildings, {{spread out}} over a large distance, rendered access to the city increasingly difficult: the fortress became a straitjacket for its inhabitants. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the gaps in the old medieval defences were closed off. The Marie gate was buried under Bastion Marie in 1548. The Lampert, Orvis, Beckerich and Jost gates disappeared in the early 17th century under the Berlaimont, Louis, Beck and Jost bastions. The military logic behind {{the need for an}} inaccessible fortress contrasted with that in favour of a merchant city, open to the outside. The 1644 closure of the Jews' gate, the city's main access from the West which had facilitated trade with the Netherlands, was a key date in this process. Traffic was obliged to bypass the plain, and enter by the New Gate (Porte-Neuve) built from 1626 to 1636. A traveller coming from France now had to descend into the Grund <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> through the Fishmarket, passing through several gates on the way.|$|E

25|$|For an {{organization}} {{to be focused}} on a democratic leadership style, traits, functions and relationships have to be obtained. Before you can classify someone to leadership position, certain qualities have to follow. The common assumptions of leaders are: leaders are born; however, this is not the case. Leaders are developed through different types of training and experience. Through the training and experience, the leader gains different traits to help make the organization functional. Leaders need to be interpersonal, cognitive, and motivational. An interpersonal leader allows for relationships to be built and to communicate messages to their followers. Cognitive leaders are able to problem solve more effective because of their intellectual ability to process information <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with creative ideas to help eliminate the problem in the organization. Finally, having motivational leaders gets the organization excited about new tasks and this allows for positive productions to occur. Motivation has been associated with ratings of leadership potential, career achievement, and promotion. The three traits will help a leader become successful because others will look up to them, and create a positive organization to work in.|$|E

Weinstock noted that it was unusual for an actor in a film to do this. Reynolds kept one of the Deadpool costumes for himself, and appeared in it throughout the marketing campaign. Visual effects vendor Image Engine animated Deadpool's mask for these appearances, using a similar process to that used by Weta Digital for the film.|$|E

Bruce Bailey admired the film's script, stating, [...] "Terry Jones has drawn on his dry wit and bizarre imagination <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with a script that transforms these essentially familiar elements and plot structures into something that fairly throbs with new life." [...] Bailey was also impressed by the film's depth, writing, [...] "adults will have the additional advantage of appreciating the story as a coming-of-age parable." ...|$|E

She took a hiatus from music, however, after the death of her husband, Scottish saxophonist Jason Rae, in March 2008 to an accidental overdose of methadone and alcohol. For a long period of time, Rae said, [...] "I didn't really hear any songs. Normally in my everyday life, I'd be in the car <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with a little line, or I'd look at something and try to describe it ... I didn't really think in that way anymore. Nothing was coming in." [...] After months of grief and isolation, Rae revisited her work the following year and composed additional material for The Sea.|$|E

Usually how we did it was [...] he'll write one verse, Bow Wow would write one verse, his homeboy Rocka would write one, and I'd write a verse <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with the hook." [...] In a 2009 {{interview with}} HipHopDX, Bow Wow commented on how getting T.I. to ghostwrite for him on his third album didn't tarnish his credibility as a rapper, saying that he learned about the songwriting process by contributing about 85 percent to the album while T.I. wrote a full song and a couple verses to a few tracks.|$|E
500|$|Freelance writer Dan Vebber, who {{is known}} for his work on the {{animated}} series Futurama, wrote [...] "The Book Job" [...] with contributions from the staff writers on The Simpsons. Matt Selman, an executive producer and writer on The Simpsons, was the one who conceived of the idea behind the episode. He was inspired by an article in The New Yorker about the book packaging company Alloy Entertainment—the publisher of series such as Gossip Girl and Vampire Diaries—and the company's use of ghostwriters. According to Selman, the article [...] "was all about how these executives take market research <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with the ideas for these books and farms them out and slaps the name of fake writers on them and fabricates backgrounds for these authors who don’t exist. We took that trend and kind of blew it up and shoved it in the face of Lisa".|$|E

Of the awkwardness of a grown man spending so much time with a teenaged Rogen, Apatow said: [...] "I'm such a comedy fan that, even though he's16, I know I'm hanging out with one of the guys who's {{going to be one of}} the great comics." [...] Around this time, Apatow would come up with odd requests for Rogen and Goldberg, such as turn an idea of his into a movie in 10 days <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with 100 one-page ideas for films. Regarding Apatow's professional effect on Rogen, the actor said in 2009, [...] "Obviously, I can't stress how important Judd's been to my career".|$|E
