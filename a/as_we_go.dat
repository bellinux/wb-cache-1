5|$|Beginning in 1934, Holloway {{appeared}} {{in a series of}} British films, three of which featured his creation Sam Small. He started his association with the filmmakers Ealing Studios in 1934, appearing in the fifth Gracie Fields picture Sing <b>As</b> <b>We</b> <b>Go.</b> His other films from the 1930s included Squibs (1935) and The Vicar of Bray (1937). In December 1934, Holloway made his first appearance in pantomime, playing Abanazar in Aladdin. In his first season in the part, he was overshadowed by his co-star, Sir Henry Lytton, as the Emperor, but he quickly became established as a favourite in his role, playing it in successive years in Leeds, London, Edinburgh and Manchester.|$|E

25|$|So there’s no real choice this year, {{but what}} the Occupy {{movement}} has done has taken {{us back to the}} era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said ‘This is unacceptable!’ We cannot have a situation where everything is owned by the 1% {{in the same way that}} Martin Luther King said in the Riverside Church that we have a government that is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. So the memory of Martin Luther King – it’s about dreams, but it’s also about the courage to draw a line right there and say ‘We cannot go on crossing this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the world’. And there today America is on that line. And people know that what we got to – these years after Martin Luther King was murdered – is completely unacceptable, and it’s his example that will inspire us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> forward into this year.|$|E
500|$|Several {{students}} were fined ₤5 by the magistrate, Paul Taylor, at South-West London Police Court in Battersea. This triggered another protest two days later, when 1,000 medical students from UCL, King's, Guy's and the West Middlesex hospitals marched along the Strand toward King's College, waving miniature brown dogs on sticks and a life-sized effigy of the magistrate, and singing, [...] "Let's hang Paul Taylor on a sour apple tree / <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> marching on." [...] The Times {{reported that they}} tried to burn the effigy but, unable to light it, {{threw it in the}} Thames instead.|$|E

500|$|Once {{technical}} rehearsals {{began and}} cameras were added in, Ashdown {{moved from the}} studio floor to an outside broadcast truck. All cameras on set were cabled to the truck, allowing Ashdown to oversee the entire episode remotely. Ashdown approached the episode {{as though it were}} a theatrical performance, explaining: [...] "We can work on performance and blocking early on, discussing issues and discovering the text <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go.</b> Actors know to save their energy when technical rehearsals are taking place and then it's quite magical when all elements are combined close to the first performance. Of course, our theatre company will have it's [...] opening and closing night on Friday, February 19!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the film came as a {{surprise}} to many fans who were expecting Thanos, the mastermind behind the events of the first film, to be the main villain in the sequel, with Whedon saying, [...] "Thanos was never meant to be the next villain. He's always been the overlord of villainy and darkness." [...] Commenting on finding the right balance between technology- and fantasy-based heroes in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Feige said [...] "Iron Man is a very technological hero; his movies are always technologically based. The first Thor was all about introducing Asgard and Thor in that more fantastical realm into the more reality-based MCU… <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> into Ultron clearly he does come out of technology, but we're using all of our tools at our disposal that we've established so far as part of the MCU to build the storyline of Age of Ultron." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{between his}} stage roles, Holloway had a {{successful}} film career. [...] He made his silent film debut in 1921 in The Rotters {{and went on to}} star in over 60 motion pictures, with his last being in 1976. His credits covered many genres including drama, romance and comedy and he shared successful collaborations with a number of studios, including Gaumont-British Picture Corporation, Gainsborough Studios and, most notably, Ealing Studios. He started his association with Ealing in 1934, appearing in the fifth Gracie Fields picture, Sing <b>As</b> <b>We</b> <b>Go.</b> After a ten-year absence from the studios, Holloway returned to star in Champagne Charlie in 1944 alongside Tommy Trinder and went on to star in Nicholas Nickleby (1947) and Another Shore (1948). However, it was the next three Ealing Comedies, Passport to Pimlico (1949), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953), which confirmed Holloway as a mainstay of British cinema. His final film with the studio was Meet Mr. Lucifer (1953).|$|E

I have been looking at all the streets <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> past, I have been looking at all the shops <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> past, I have been looking at all the churches <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> past. At first, I felt a little dazed with the vastness of it all. I could not understand what it all meant. But now I know exactly what it all means. It means us. This whole civilization is only a dream. You and I are the realities." ...|$|R
500|$|At Electric Lady, Badu {{applied a}} {{multifaceted}} approach to recording her vocals and opted against editing them in post-production. Using her voice impressionistically, her vocals {{were characterized by}} high scales, varied frequencies, wide intervals, and time-stretched harmonies. Chavarria, who engineered the vocals with Badu, remarked on her singing, [...] "Her voice has so many frequencies, from a subharmonic of her tonic to a thin raspiness, {{and she wants to}} hear all of that." [...] Badu used a Shure SM57 dynamic microphone, finding it to have enough bottom for her voice type, and cut vocal takes while situated between two speakers in the studio's control room with the monitor mix playing. She explained this setting to be more comfortable, noting the ability to hear herself sing and hold the microphone when moving around. Badu preferred to sing in one take rather than edit different takes together: [...] "When I do vocals, I am singing with a certain volume in my voice. I am singing the double and triple harmonies at different volumes. You don't have to adjust it; I have already done it. We mix <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go,</b> so by the time we put the vocals to ½-inch tape, I know it. If you touch a damn thing, I will know it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Fraternity Hymn {{was written}} by brother Scott Jeffrey Heckstall Jr. {{when he was a}} {{prospective}} member of the Eta Gamma chapter in 1977. Heckstall had wanted to be a charter member, but was not chosen. Heckstall was encouraged to rush, and he recalled that as part of his rush process, a couple of brothers took him to a piano and told him, [...] "We know that you play [...] in church. We need a fraternity hymn. We'll give you three hours, and you sit over there {{and come up with a}} hymn. We'll come back in three hours, and we expect a hymn." [...] Heckstall recalled the hymn Someday (Beams of Heaven As I Go) by Charles Albert Tindley and changed a few words—for example, [...] "Beams of Heaven as I go through this wilderness below" [...] became [...] "K K Psi, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> through this wilderness here below." [...] The brothers of Eta Gamma were satisfied with Heckstall's hymn. Years later, the hymn was presented to the brotherhood assembled at the 1995 National Convention and accepted as the national fraternity hymn. Blue and white are the fraternity's official colors. The fraternity flower is a red carnation, so chosen because it was founder William Scroggs's favorite flower.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the words}} of former NASA Administrator, Michael D. Griffin, [...] "The goal isn't just {{scientific}} exploration.... It's also about extending the range of human habitat out from Earth into the Solar System <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> forward in time.... In the long run a single-planet species will not survive.... If we humans want to survive {{for hundreds of thousands}} or millions of years, we must ultimately populate other planets ... colonize the Solar System and one day go beyond." ...|$|E

2500|$|In concept, the {{algorithm}} is recursive, reducing the graph {{to a smaller}} graph with one less vertex, five-coloring that graph, and then using that coloring to determine a coloring for the larger graph in constant time. In practice, rather than maintain an explicit graph representation for each reduced graph, we will remove vertices from the graph <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go,</b> adding them to a stack, then color them as we pop them back off the stack at the end. We will maintain three stacks: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{series is}} a thriller, love story, and mystery with {{an element of}} science fiction. Unlike other well known series of the same genre, {{producers}} had promised timely answers to mysteries, with some answers provided {{as early as the}} upcoming episode. Executive producer Evan Katz stated that [...] "everything is designed to answer questions so you're not frustrated or feeling like we're making it up <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> along" [...] and the writers intended to keep the viewers guessing in a [...] "fair way." ...|$|E
2500|$|By our assumption, {{the matrix}} [...] {{associated}} {{to a list}} of intervals will remain essentially unchanged from one time step to the next. To exploit this, the list of intervals is actually maintained as a list of labeled endpoints. Each element of the list has the coordinate of an endpoint of an interval, as well as a unique integer identifying that interval. Then, we sort the list by coordinates, and update the matrix [...] <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go.</b> It's not so hard to believe that this algorithm will work relatively quickly if indeed the configuration of bounding boxes does not change significantly from one time step to the next.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Massimo Pigliucci on the Rationally Thinking podcast, Baggott stated that science is a human endeavor with a [...] "fuzziness around the edges". He {{went on to say}} that there are no rules and, when training to be a scientist, no one gives you an instruction book on how to do science. [...] "We kinda make it up <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> along... and it is perfectly reasonable for the scientific community to want to change those rules." [...] Science writer Philip Ball, in a review of Farewell in The Guardian, stated that Baggott was right [...] "although his target is as much the way this science is marketed as what it contains." [...] Ball cautioned Baggott about criticising scientists that speculate because [...] "conjecture injects vitality into science." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> {{from each}} pair {{to the next}} pair x increases, and so does y. This {{relationship}} is perfect, {{in the sense that}} an increase in x is always accompanied by an increase iny. This means that we have a perfect rank correlation, and both Spearman's and Kendall's correlation coefficients are 1, whereas in this example Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is 0.7544, indicating that the points are far from lying on a straight line. In the same way if y always decreases when x increases, the rank correlation coefficients will be −1, while the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient {{may or may not be}} close to −1, depending on how close the points are to a straight line. [...] Although in the extreme cases of perfect rank correlation the two coefficients are both equal (being both +1 or both −1), this is not generally the case, and so values of the two coefficients cannot meaningfully be compared. For example, for the three pairs (1,1) (2,3) (3,2) Spearman's coefficient is 1/2, while Kendall's coefficient is1/3.|$|E
2500|$|... "Take My Life, Please" [...] {{was written}} by Don Payne and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. It was the first episode of The Simpsons to air in 720p high-definition television, though {{not the first time}} The Simpsons appeared in high-definition, as The Simpsons Movie was rendered in HD. With the new broadcasting system came a new opening sequence. It was the first major permanent change to the show's introduction since the opening added in season 2; previous changes have included variations in the duration of the intro, and special one-shot introductions for the Treehouse of Horror Halloween episodes, as well as a handful of others. This new intro also includes some 3D animation when the camera pans over [...] The Simpsons creator Matt Groening told the New York Post: [...] "The clouds {{at the very beginning of}} the main title were always unsatisfying to me. My original direction to the animators was to make the clouds as realistic as possible, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> through the clouds we enter this cartoon universe of The Simpsons. Finally, after a couple of decades, they've gotten closer to what I had in my mind. Not perfect, but better." ...|$|E
