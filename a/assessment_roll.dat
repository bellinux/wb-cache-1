50|$|This village, {{with its}} small {{municipal}} area, might have arisen relatively late. It {{lay in the}} so-called Remigiusland, which belonged to the Bishopric of Reims and the Abbey of Saint-Remi in Reims. Consequently, Blaubach had its first documentary mention in the Remigiusberg Monastery’s taxation books in 1436, and it was mentioned once more in a 1480 taxation <b>assessment</b> <b>roll</b> from the Amt of Lichtenberg. As early as 1112, Count Gerlach I had, with {{the founding of the}} County of Veldenz, among other things, taken over the protection of the Remigiusland, which thenceforth belonged to the Veldenz Oberamt of Lichtenberg. In 1444, Count Palatine Stephan had founded the County Palatine of Zweibrücken, to which the whole County of Veldenz, along with the Oberamt of Lichtenberg, belonged. Listed in the 1480 document was every village in the Oberamt, including Blaubach, which then belonged to the Pfeffelbach Amt or the Diedelkopf Amt (Unteramt). The 1480 roll also gives a clue as to Blaubach’s population: it listed four families with roughly 20 people. It is likely, though, that there were others who did not appear on the roll because they paid no taxes (Hintersassen - roughly, “dependent peasants”). Thus, the population might have numbered as high as 40.|$|E

40|$|Property tax is a {{main source}} of revenue for {{financing}} municipal operations. Property tax rates can be established once council adopts the annual operating and capital budgets and the annual <b>assessment</b> <b>roll</b> is prepared. Most municipal councils will pass their property tax bylaws in April or May. There are four assessment classes: residential; non-residential (i. e. commercial, industrial, and linear); farm land; and machinery and equipment. Council may vary the municipal tax rates {{for each of the}} four assessment classes, but the rate for the machinery and equipment class must equal the rate for the non-residential class. The Municipal Government Act (MGA) does provide for sub-classes for residential, but does not provide for the splitting of tax rates within the non-residential assessment class (other than for vacant and improved property). The tax rates are set annually. A property tax rate is calculated by dividing the tax levy required by the corresponding property assessment class or subclass, or if desired, the total tax levy required by the total property assessment. For example, if a municipality needs to raise a total levy of $ 200, 000 from non-residential propertie...|$|E
40|$|In the {{administration}} of the property tax in California, achieving equity in the equalization process requires two elements. First, the taxpayer and the appeals board should have as much relevant information as possible about the value of the property and about the assessment placed on that property by the assessor. Second, all parties must receive an adequate, impartial hearing of any appeal regarding that property. For purposes of local property taxation, equalization means adjustments in the values of properties listed on the <b>assessment</b> <b>roll</b> to conform to their values within the parameters of property tax laws. By the Revenue Act of 1857, the California Legislature designated each county board of supervisors to serve as the county board of equalization. The California State Constitution, adopted in 1879, included specific provisions for county boards of supervisors to sit as the local boards of equalization. In 1880, the California Supreme Court interpreted the constitutional language by affirming that it "empowered a county board of equalization to increase or lower an individual assessment on the county roll,… " 1 The current language, set forth in section 16 of article XIII of the Constitution, provides in part...|$|E
40|$|Context: Many {{agencies}} are promoting widespread availability of automated external defibrillators (AED) {{in public places}} {{despite a lack of}} evidence for the best locations for public access defibrillation (PAD). Objective: To identify high-risk cardiac arrest locations to guide the optimal distribution of AEDs {{in a wide variety of}} communities. Design, Setting, and Patients: A prospective cohort study of adult, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of presumed cardiac etiology within the 20 communities of the Ontario Prehospital Advanced Life Support (OPALS) study from July 1, 1995 to June 30, 2000. The property <b>assessment</b> <b>roll</b> identified the specific property type for each cardiac arrest address and the total number of sites, per location type, within the study boundary. Main Outcome Measures: Measures of the potential utility of PAD for each of 26 location categories, including the number of PAD programs needed to treat one cardiac arrest, and the potential PAD use per site in years. Results: Overall, 7, 667 (99. 5 %) of 7707 cardiac arrests had valid address information. Private residences comprised 85 % of the arrest locations and the remaining 15 % were public locations. Potential PAD venues include (location-specific cardiac arrest rates per site, the number of PAD programs needed to treat one cardiac arrest during a five-year period and the potential PAD use per site in years) : casinos (14, 0. 07, 0. 4); non-acute hospitals (1, 1, 5); nursing/retirement homes (1, 1, 5); penal institutions (0. 3, 4, 18); indoor shopping malls (0. 2, 5, 26); and hotels (0. 1, 9, 46). All other remaining locations had poor utility scores. Conclusions: Most cardiac arrests occur in private residences. It appears that only a few locations may be amenable to efficient placement of PAD. All communities considering public placement of AEDs should identify high-risk sites to guide the rational deployment of these devices...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore several issues {{regarding}} the industrial geography of the North American city between 1850 and 1918, using Montreal as a case-study. The two dominant locational theories (Weberian and transactional) are critiqued and three problems are identified: their reliance on simplistic conceptions of industrial organization; their inability {{to take account of}} cycles of investment; and their neglect of the social construction of the built environment. A reformulation of urban industrial geography is presented which stresses the diversity of productive strategies open to industries; the relationship of these strategies to rhythms of changes to technology, the labour process, and the organizational structure of firms; and the actions of local growth machines in the making of industrial space. These claims are developed through an empirical examination of Montreal. Using the municipal tax <b>assessment</b> <b>rolls</b> a description of the location of Montreal's manufacturing firms in 1861 and 1890 establishes the context {{for a discussion of the}} key dynamics of the city's industrial geography through histories of selected industries (clothing, metal, cotton, and baking) and industrial districts (Saint-Ann and Saint-Henri) ...|$|R
