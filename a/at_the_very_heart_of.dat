In 1929 he wrote: "Norway became my second homeland. I worked there like mad. [ [...] . ] I learned to understand the essence of nature. The existence of animals, trees, stones.

The observations and interpretations done in this paper begin by describing the 'collective' image of Norway in pre-world-war-one Germany and continue to cover the letters written by the young author while in exile in Norway, the "Norwegisches Tagebuch" [Norwegian Diary] and the novel "Ugrino und Ingrabanien" [Ugrino and Ingrabanien] ("Ugrino" and "Norge" share many similarities). The paper then moves on to analyse the play "Armut, Reichtum, Mensch und Tier" [Poverty, Richness, Human and Animal] and the two large novels "Perrudja" and "Fluss ohne Ufer" [River with no Bank], which are both (to a great extent) located in Norway. The key task of this paper is then to analyse two selected extracts (one of the two extensive novels each) in great detail with the goal of demonstrating that "Norge" is not only a model of an archaic state (of being) from a content perspective. But it is also Jahnn's key quality as a (poetic) writer to create a huge variety of methods from a language perspective with the successful aim of creating a harsh, rugged image of the nature of Norway in the mind of the reader - a nature which is dismissive of human beings and is stronger than mankind...|$|R

Although usually separated by geography, such thinkers would meet and debate {{with one another}} at Johnson's house in London, often over dinner. This network not only brought authors into contact with each other, it also brought new writers to Johnson's business. For example, Priestley introduced John Newton to Johnson, Newton brought John Hewlett, and Hewlett invited Mary Wollstonecraft, who in turn attracted Mary Hays who brought William Godwin.

500|$|The Shakti {{panel in}} the east shrine is unusual in that {{counting}} Parvati, it features eight mothers (Asta matrikas) {{in an era when}} Sapta matrikas were more common such as at Samalaji and Jogeswari caves.

According to Sara L. Schastok, the Skanda in the east shrine of Elephanta Cave 1 is significant, just like the one found in Deogarh Hindu temple site, because he is depicted with regalia, weapons and icons similar to Shiva and because he is surrounded by gods and goddeses. By portraying Skanda with Matrikas, he is equated with the Krittikas legend and thereby Kartikeya, and by showing him so prominently centered the artists are likely communicating the unity of Skanda-Shiva, that all these divinities are in essence the same spiritual concept, [...] "all emanations of the lingam <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> Elephanta", according to Schastok.|$|E

40|$|No {{matter the}} reasons for the birth of a city, water sits <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>heart</b> {{ensuring}} a healthy working population. Johannesburg is one of the only cities in the world that has no major water source of its own and as a result has its water pumped uphill from the Vaal Dam into <b>the</b> city. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time the city faces a crisis that is based on both the supply and demand for water. In South Africa, an already water stressed country, it is predicted that precipitation will reduce over the next century, reducing runoff and the supply of fresh water together with demand eventually over taking supply. Through rethinking how the inner city of Johannesburg deals with the saving, purifying and redistribution of its available surface water, the idea of water infrastructure can become something more than a subconscious operation controlled from a far off location and pumped unsustainably back into the city, and more like a series of upgraded machines dispersed about the city within localized contexts, supplementing the existing vital operations on a very obvious and conscious level in order to protect its populations by better protecting it’s most important resource of all. Located within the Maboneng Precinct and more specifically located over a channel of water that becomes the Braamfontein Spruit, this thesis aims at designing a building that will incorporate a water treatment facility together with research laboratories to purify grey water to a standard that is usable for most needs including drinking. Water however does not exist by itself when placed within the context of any environment that has an established infrastructural system. It exists together with the many various machines and pipes hidden from our everyday lives; they are the subconscious networks of the city’s mind, constantly working in the back(under) ground to maintain a reliable flow and quality while the populations go about their conscious, daily functions. The aim is twofold; firstly to show how developing technologies can be experimented on a smaller neighbour-hood scale in order to encourage the development of new thinking and secondly, by developing a Water treatment facility and laboratory coupled with daily social functions as well as offices sited in an urban environment, I hope to show that infrastructural projects that are usually located on the outskirts of cities, away from every day activity, can enhance the civic quality of an urban space. With every system becoming more reliant on technology, water needs to be seen not only as an entity that exists within the natural cycles of the planet, but one that also exists <b>very</b> much within <b>the</b> mechanized systems of the city’s infrastructure, with its availability relying heavily on those systems that manage it as well as the daily social functions that hinge off of it...|$|R
