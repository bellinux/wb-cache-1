He managed to stab the store owner, but was shot by his wife and later died in hospital. Police ruled out the shooting as legitimate self-defense. This case is notable, because the store the man attempted to rob was a gun store, leading many to speculations that the robbery was, in fact, a suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, German tank theory was pioneered by two figures: General Oswald Lutz and {{his chief of}} staff, Lieutenant Colonel Heinz Guderian. Guderian became the more {{influential}} of the two and his ideas were widely publicized. Like his contemporary, Sir Percy Hobart, Guderian initially envisioned an armored corps (panzerkorps) composed of several types of tanks. This included a slow infantry tank, <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small-caliber cannon and several machine guns. The infantry tank, according to Guderian, was to be heavily armored to defend against enemy anti-tank guns and artillery. He also envisioned a fast breakthrough tank, similar to the British cruiser tank, {{which was to be}} armoured against enemy anti-tank weapons and have a large, 75-millimeter (2.95in) main gun. Lastly, Germany needed a heavy tank, <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 150-millimeter (5.9in) cannon to defeat enemy fortifications, and even stronger armor. Such a tank required a weight of 70 to 100tonnes and was completely impractical given the manufacturing capabilities of the day.|$|E

5|$|Most capable Soviet tank at Kursk was the T-34, the {{original}} version was <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 76.2mm gun, the gun struggled against uparmoured Panzer IVs, and the frontal armour of Tigers and Panthers was essentially impenetrable. Only SU-122 and the SU-152 {{had the power to}} destroy the Tiger at short range, but they were not equal to the Tiger's 88mm gun at long range, and there were very few SU-122 and the SU-152 at Kursk.|$|E

5|$|The Tosa-class {{ships were}} {{intended}} to be <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> main battery of ten 45-caliber 41-centimeter guns in five twin turrets, four of which were superfiring fore and aft. Numbered one through five from front to rear, the hydraulically powered turrets had an elevation range of −2 to +35 degrees. The rate of fire for the guns was around two rounds per minute. The ships were designed to carry 90 rounds per gun, although space was available for 110.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between the heavy infantry types of hastati, principes and triarii began to blur, perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment to all but the first class of troops, who alone were able to afford their own equipment.
