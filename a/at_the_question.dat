25|$|In {{cooperation}} with the literary scholar , DAS GEDICHT initiated a widely followed debate on, “Is {{there such a thing}} as a European poem?” Alongside translations from English, Spanish, or Classical Greek authors, the magazine regularly features German-language poetry from outside Germany, such as Austrian, Swiss, and Luxembourgian poetry. DAS GEDICHT has also often been the root of productive altercations among aesthetic positions and has facilitated debate among poets. Looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> – short poem or long poem – many prominent German poets engaged in critical exchange within the realm of the magazine: Durs Grünbein, , and Jürgen Becker. The critic and member of the Group 47, , dedicated a larger portion of his radio broadcast, in order to give this debate a national audience.|$|E
500|$|Angela Breitenbach, looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of {{teleology}} {{in biology}} from a Kantian perspective, argues that teleology is important as [...] "a heuristic {{in the search}} for causal explanations of nature and... an inevitable analogical perspective on living beings." [...] In her view of Kant, teleology implies something that cannot be explained by science, but only understood through analogy.|$|E
500|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata in Leipzig {{in his first}} annual cycle as Thomaskantor for the fifth Sunday after Easter, called Rogate. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle of James, [...] "doers of the word, not only listeners" [...] (...) and from the Gospel of John, from the farewell discourses of Jesus, prayers will be fulfilled (...) [...] The theme of the cantata is a quotation from the gospel at the beginning, the promise of Jesus [...] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you". An unknown poet used as movement 3 the 16th stanza of 's hymn [...] "" [...] (1530), and as the closing chorale the eleventh stanza of [...] "" [...] by Paul Speratus (1524). The poet hints <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> how the promise can be understood looking at the reality of life. In movement 2 he uses {{the image of a}} rose with thorns to illustrate two conflicting aspects. In movements 3 and 4 he confirms the promise which has to be seen in the perspective of time. Movement 5 refers to the waiting for a promise being kept, and the closing chorale assures that God knows the right time. The structure of the six movements – a gospel quotation in the beginning, chorales as movements 3 and 6, the sequence of recitative and arias – is similar to , first performed one week earlier.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998 the Austrian {{government}} {{introduced the}} Art Restitution Act, which looked again <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of art stolen by the Nazis. The government formed a restitution committee {{to report on}} which works should be returned; government archives were opened up to research into the provenance of works held by the government. Hubertus Czernin, the Austrian investigative journalist, undertook extensive research in the newly opened archives and published {{a story about the}} theft of art by the Nazis; with the subsequent refusal of the Austrian state to return the art or to acknowledge a theft had taken place, Czernin described the situation as [...] "a double crime".|$|E
2500|$|There is {{no formal}} {{definition}} of what constitutes self-experimentation. [...] A strict definition might limit it to cases {{where there is a}} single-subject experiment and the experimenter performs the procedure on himself. [...] A looser definition might include cases where the experimenters put themselves amongst the volunteers for the experiment. [...] According to S. C. Gandevia of the University of New South Wales, who was looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> from the perspective of ethics, it is only self-experiment if the would-be self-experimenter would be named as an author on any subsequent published paper. [...] That is, the person who would receive the academic credit for the experiment must also be the subject of it.|$|E

[...] During this time, Cass also looked more deeply <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of how individual saving behavior and efficient growth were related. [...] The paper on present values as efficiency prices that Cass co-authored with Yaari is easily seen to be a precursor of [...] his subsequent work at Carnegie Mellon on capital overaccumulation and efficiency {{which led to the}} famous Cass criterion for determining inefficiency. [...] Finally, Cass's work with Stiglitz on modeling investor preferences and asset returns provided a foundation for his later work on financial general equilibrium.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2009, Clinton {{embarked}} on her longest trip yet, {{to a number}} of stops in Africa. On August 10, 2009, at a public event in Kinshasa, a Congolese student asked her what her husband, [...] "Mr Clinton", thought of a Chinese trade deal with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Clinton looked irritated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> and replied, [...] "Wait, {{you want me to tell}} you what my husband thinks? My husband is not the secretary of state, I am. So you ask my opinion, I will tell you my opinion. I am not going to be channeling my husband." [...] The incident was played in newsrooms around the world. Clinton aides suggested there might have been a mistranslation, but that was not the case; however the student had later apologized to her, saying he had meant to ask what [...] "Mr Obama" [...] thought.|$|E
2500|$|Democrats on the {{committee}} grilled Alito on his past association with the conservative group Concerned Alumni of Princeton. Alito stated that he had listed an affiliation with the group on his application to Ronald Reagan's Justice Department {{in order to establish}} his conservative credentials: [...] "You have to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> that I was responding to and the form that I was filling out... I was applying for a position in the Reagan administration. And my answers were truthful statements, but what I was trying to outline were the things that were relevant to obtaining a political position." [...] During the confirmation hearings, Alito disavowed the group, whose views were criticized as racist and sexist, saying: [...] "I disavow them. I deplore them. They represent things that I have always stood against and I can't express too strongly." [...] During Alito's Senate confirmation hearings, his wife, Martha Ann Alito, broke into tears after Republicans expressed their disapproval of how Alito was being characterized by some Democrats on the panel.|$|E
