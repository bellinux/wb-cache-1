5|$|For a few centuries, Europeans had {{experimented with}} American vines and plants in their soil, and many {{varieties}} were imported from America without regulation, disregarding {{the possibility of}} pest transfer, and related problems. Jules-Emile Planchon, a French biologist, who identified the Phylloxera in the 1860s, maintained that this transfer of American vines and plants into Europe greatly increased between roughly 1858 and 1862, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> the Phylloxera was accidentally introduced to Europe around 1860, although the aphid did not enter France until around 1863. It is believed that the advent of steamships was a factor as well, as the ships were faster, and the Phylloxera were able to survive the quicker ocean voyage.|$|E
5|$|The name {{derives from}} the British Celtic, meaning 'fair, fine, brisk’. It {{is not to be}} {{confused}} with other rivers in the south west of England with the same name. The historic spelling, Froom, is still sometimes used <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> the name of the river is pronounced (as in broom). In the nineteenth and twentieth century the River Frome became known in East Bristol as the Danny. The derivation of this name is uncertain, some suggest a nickname, taken from the Blue Danube Waltz, others that it was derived from the Australian slang word dunny.|$|E
25|$|In another story, the Crow tell of a {{child who}} fell out of his travois as his family moved to new hunting grounds. The Little People adopted the boy and raised him in a cave in the Pryor Mountains. The boy absorbed part of their magic, and grew to become supernaturally strong. He began to build tall columns of stone and rocks for fun, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> Medicine Rocks was created.|$|E

Even after reclaiming his title {{as the one}} true Superman, he kept his hair long <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> he <b>was</b> depicted {{for much of his}} appearances in the 1990s comics. Before his wedding with Lois, he cut his hair.|$|R
25|$|His purported {{mission was}} to take upon himself {{the sins of the}} world, and he claimed he could {{transfer}} to his followers spiritual power and ultimately take away their sins and bad deeds.

25|$|The High Lamas used {{several ways}} in which they can {{increase}} the chances of finding a person they claim to be the reincarnation. High Lamas often visit Lhamo La-tso, a lake in central Tibet, and watch for a sign from the lake itself. <b>This</b> may <b>be</b> either a claimed 'vision' or some 'indication' of the direction in which to search, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> Tenzin Gyatso <b>was</b> determined to be the next Dalai Lama.|$|R
25|$|During {{a meeting}} with Chantrey, Ellen-Jane {{expressed}} to him {{a clear idea of}} what she wanted. She told Chantrey of how in the past she had watched as her daughters fell asleep in each other's arms <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> she wanted them represented. She had also taken inspiration from Thomas Banks’ Boothby Monument in St Oswald's Church, Ashbourne. The statue depicts the daughter of Sir Brooke Boothby who had died during childhood. Chantrey visited this monument and then returned to his home to make a model of his proposed sculpture.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds of ABC {{transporters}} {{have been}} characterized from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. ABC genes {{are essential for}} many processes in the cell, and mutations in human genes cause or contribute to several human genetic diseases. Forty eight ABC genes {{have been reported in}} humans. Among these, many have been characterized and shown to be causally related to diseases present in humans such as cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, Stargardt disease, drug-resistant tumors, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Byler’s disease, progressive familiar intrahepatic cholestasis, X-linked sideroblastic anemia, ataxia, and persistent and hyperinsulimenic hypoglycemia. ABC transporters are also involved in multiple drug resistance, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> some of them were first identified. When the ABC transport proteins are overexpressed in cancer cells, they can export anticancer drugs and render tumors resistant.|$|E
25|$|Samkhya school {{suggests}} that jnana (knowledge) is a sufficient means to moksha, Patanjali {{suggests that}} systematic techniques/practice (personal experimentation) combined with Samkhya's approach to knowledge is {{the path to}} moksha. Patanjali holds that ignorance {{is the cause of}} suffering and saṁsāra. Liberation, like many other schools, is removal of ignorance, which is achieved through discriminative discernment, knowledge and self-awareness. The Yoga Sūtras is Yoga school's treatise on how to accomplish this. Samādhi is the state where ecstatic awareness develops, state Yoga scholars, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> one starts the process of becoming aware of Purusa and true Self. It further claims that this awareness is eternal, and once this awareness is achieved, a person cannot ever cease being aware; this is moksha, the soteriological goal in Hinduism.|$|E

25|$|Only Holinshed {{contains}} {{information about}} the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, which Shakespeare used for the scenes of Cade's rebellion throughout Act 4 (for example, details such as having people killed because they could read, and promises of setting up a state with no money). The presentation of Henry's reaction to the rebellion also differs in Hall and Holinshed. In Hall, Henry pardons everyone who surrenders and lets them all return home unpunished, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> Shakespeare presents it in the play. In Holinshed, by contrast, Henry convenes a court and has several of the leaders executed (as he did in reality). Another historical parallel found in Holinshed is that Henry is presented as unstable, constantly {{on the brink of}} madness, something which is not in Hall, who presents a gentle but ineffective King (again, Shakespeare follows Hall here).|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Abin the Levite, {{the son of}} Rabbi Judah the Prince, {{taught that}} the Israelites became wealthy from the plague of blood. If an Egyptian and an Israelite were in a house {{where there was a}} barrel full of water, and the Egyptian went to fill a pitcher from the barrel, the Egyptian would find that it {{contained}} blood, while the Israelite would drink water from the same barrel. When the Egyptian asked the Israelite to give the Egyptian some water with the Israelite's own hand, it still became blood. Even if the Egyptian said to the Israelite that they should both drink from one vessel, the Israelite would drink water, but the Egyptian would drink blood. It was only when the Egyptian bought water from the Israelite for money that the Egyptian was able to drink water. <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> the Israelites became rich.|$|E
25|$|As {{discussed}} above, {{the floral}} organs of eudicotyledonous angiosperms {{are arranged in}} 4 different verticils, containing the sepals, petals, stamen and carpels. The ABC model states that the identity of these organs {{is determined by the}} homeotic genes A, A+B, B+C and C, respectively. In contrast with the sepal and petal verticils of the eudicots, the perigone of many plants of the Liliaceae family have two nearly identical external petaloid verticils (the tepals). In order to explain the floral morphology of the Liliaceae, van Tunen et al. proposed a modified ABC model in 1993. This model suggests that class B genes are not only expressed in verticils 2 and 3, but also in 1. It therefore follows that the organs of verticils 1 and 2 express class A and B genes <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> they have a petaloid structure. This theoretical model has been experimentally proven through the cloning and characterization of homologs of the Antirrhinum genes GLOBOSA and DEFICIENS in a Liliaceae, the tulip Tulipa gesneriana. These genes are expressed in verticils 1,2 and 3.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} eleven seasons of their {{existence}} in the NBA, the Suns had no official mascot, but some years later this mascot was born by accident. A messenger for Eastern Onion, a singing telegram service, came to the Coliseum during a home game dressed as a gorilla. As he left, Coliseum security suggested he do a few dances underneath the basket during a timeout and the fans loved it. So did the messenger, who kept coming to games until he was officially invited {{to be part of}} the team. <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> this mascot was accidentally born. The messenger, a quiet young man named Henry Rojas, was anything but quiet in his costume. An early attempt was made involving a sunflower costume, but it never caught on. Given a Suns warm-up jacket, Rojas shed his shyness, and turned into an entertainment beast, dancing, joking with fans and, in general, enjoying himself to the fullest. Nowadays, the Suns Gorilla is one of the most famous mascots in the NBA.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{title of the}} song was [...] "Dime Store", which originates from the line [...] "In the dime stores and bus stations..." [...] The official title [...] "Love Minus Zero/No Limit" [...] is, according to Dylan, a fraction with [...] "Love Minus Zero" [...] {{on the top and}} [...] "No" [...] on the bottom, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> the title appeared on early pressings of the Bringing It All Back Home LP. Therefore, the correct pronunciation of the song's title is [...] "Love Minus Zero over No Limit". This has been interpreted as [...] "absolutely unlimited love." [...] The title is also based on gambling terminology that would mean that all love is a risk.|$|E
500|$|The {{titles of}} a number of scenes link pairs or larger groups, even if the scenes {{themselves}} are not related. Examples include plates [...] and [...] (With or without reason and The same), [...] and [...] (The women are courageous and And they are fierce), and , [...] and [...] (They do not want to, Nor these and Or these). Other plates show scenes from the same story or incident, as in plates [...] and [...] (This is bad <b>and</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> it happened), in which a monk is murdered by French soldiers looting church treasures; a rare sympathetic image of the clergy, who are generally shown to be on the side of oppression and injustice.|$|E
50|$|He {{noted that}} the people were peeved during that period but could express their views. Since the people could also not let them those in {{authority}} account for their stewardship, they consulted the gods of the area who asked them to set aside some days {{for them to come}} out and say what was on their chest more especially about the traditional authorities at that time. During the period of “Apoo” it was agreed that one could not be held responsible for what he or she said. The people would say “Mereko po me haw” which literally meant “I am going to say what was on my chest” <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> the “Apoo” festival came into existence.|$|R
25|$|Another rivalry, with Stade Bordelais, {{took its}} place, when clubs from outside Paris were finally {{allowed to play}} in 1899. The teams were going to meet in 7 of the next 10 finals, with Bordeaux winning 5 of them. Yet the most heated one was the first Stade won in 1901. Bordeaux won the match 3–0 on a hotly debated try. Afterwards, Stade accused Bordeaux of fielding three ineligible players: earlier in the year, Stade Bordelais had merged with Bordeaux Université Club to become Stade Bordelais Université Club, but three of those new players had not been with the club {{for at least three}} months as the rules dictated. The USFSA ordered a replay, but Bordeaux claimed their honour and honesty were at stake and refused it. Stade Français were {{declared}} the winners <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> their sixth title was won.|$|R
40|$|Forty-two primary human-mouse cell hybrids, derived in two {{separate}} xperi-ments, were treated with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) : eight hybrids were found to produce human interferon <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>hown</b> in every case to be predominantly of the fibroblast ype. An extensive analysis was made in terms of karyotype and marker enzymes on all the eight hybrids producing interferon and also on five hybrids which did not produce interferon, five randomly selected hybrids and eleven subclones resistant to diphtheria toxin. The results suggest that, contrary to previous reports, a gene on chromosome 5 {{is not involved in}} production of human interferon. Its production was however correlated with the presence of chromosome 9 in the hybrids. Analyses of two sets of human-Chinese hamster hybrid subclones from two different crosses were also consistent with the assign-ment of a human interferon gene to chromosome 9...|$|R
500|$|The Claytonites {{started calling}} the new faction [...] "the Brindle Tails".

In a speech he gave in Eagle Township in Pulaski County, he said that Brooks reminded him of a [...] "brindle tailed bull" [...] he had known as a child that scared all the other cattle. The Claytonist then began mockingly referring to Joseph Brooks and his supporters as [...] "Brindle Tails", <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> they were referred to from then on. The Brindle Tails' platform included a proposal for a new constitution that would re-enfranchise ex-Confederates, which appealed to Democrats and pre-war Whigs.

2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Rutgers, Díaz worked at Rutgers University Press as an {{editorial}} assistant. At this time Diaz also first created the quasi-autobiographical character of Yunior {{in a story}} he used {{as part of his}} application for his MFA program in the early 1990s. The character would become important to much of his later work including Drown <b>and</b> <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>How</b> You Lose Her. Yunior would become central to much of Diaz's work, Diaz later explaining how [...] "My idea, ever since Drown, was to write six or seven books about him that would form one big novel". He earned his MFA from Cornell University in 1995, where he wrote most of his first collection of short stories. Currently, Díaz teaches creative writing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as the Rudge and Nancy Allen Professor of Writing and is also the fiction editor for Boston Review. He is active in the Dominican American community and is {{a founding member of the}} Voices of Our Nation Arts Foundation, which focuses on writers of color.
