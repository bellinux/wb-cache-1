40|$|Abstract: Outbreaks of diarrhoea, {{haemolytic}} uraemic {{syndrome and}} food poisoning {{have been associated}} with the consumption of (<b>apple</b> <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> ciders) <b>and</b> (<b>apple</b> <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> juices). The organisms implicated in these outbreaks have been Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 serotype and Salmonella typhi (a group D serotype), indicating the resistance of the serotypes of these organisms to acidic pH. The acid tolerance, the growth, and the survival of these organisms were investigated in both natural (unpasteurized, untreated) <b>and</b> pasteurized, treated <b>apple</b> <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> juices <b>and</b> ciders. The effects of benzoic acid, as a preservative, on the growth of the mentioned bacteria subjected to examination, in trypticase soy broth <b>and</b> <b>apple</b> <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> juices <b>and</b> ciders were also examined. It was evident that E. coli O 157 :H 7 serotype and S. typhi (a group D serotype) organisms grew well in trypticase soy broth at pH level ranging from 3. 0 to 9. 0. The growth of both mentioned serotypes were inhibited by adding 0. 05 % of benzoic acid. Similarly, E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. typhi strains grew well in both natural (unpasteurized) as well as in pasteurized <b>apple</b> <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> juices <b>and</b> ciders, and the growth was inhibited by adding 0. 1 % of benzoic acid. The possible sources of contamination of natural <b>apple</b> <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> juices <b>and</b> ciders with E. coli O 157 :H 7 serotype and S. typhi (a group D serotype) are discussed. The study declared the efficacy of acids, their salts and derivatives in controlling microbial growth in food in general.

2500|$|However, {{despite his}} paper being widely {{reported}} by the media, an undermining error, according to teams of other epidemiologists who point out Tsuda's remarks are fatally wrong, is that Tsuda did an <b>apples</b> <b>and</b> <b>oranges</b> comparison by comparing the Fukushima surveys, which uses advanced ultrasound devices that detect otherwise unnoticeable thyroid growths, with data from traditional non-advanced clinical examinations, to arrive at his [...] "20 to 50 times what would be expected" [...] conclusion. In the critical words of epidemiologist Richard Wakeford, “It is inappropriate to compare {{the data from the}} Fukushima screening program with cancer registry data from the rest of Japan where there is, in general, no such large-scale screening,”. Wakeford's criticism was one of seven other author's letters that were published criticizing Tsuda's paper. According to Takamura, another epidemiologist, who examined the results of small scale advanced ultrasound tests on Japanese children not near Fukushima, [...] "The prevalence of thyroid cancer [...] does not differ meaningfully from that in Fukushima Prefecture,”.|$|E

2500|$|George Lakoff {{explained}} the inaccuracy of metonymic models, through which people {{jump to conclusions}} without sufficient elaboration, giving rise to prototype effects, in his book Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things. First of all, we commonly consider typical examples as the better examples of a category. For instance, {{in the category of}} fruits, <b>apples</b> <b>and</b> <b>oranges</b> are typical examples. It is common practice that we engage in reasoning by making inferences from typical to non-typical examples. As a matter of fact, an enormous amount of our knowledge about categories of things is organized in terms of typical cases. We constantly draw inferences on the basis of that kind of knowledge. Second, salient examples, which are familiar and memorable, are unconsciously used in our understanding of things. For instance, if one's best friend is a vegetarian and they don't know any others well, they will tend to generalize from their best friend to other vegetarians. This is what Tversky and Kahneman referred to as the [...] "Conjunction fallacy". To understand this notion via Probability theory, think of two mutually unrelated events. The theory assumes that the likelihood of the co-occurrence of the two events is lower than that of the occurrence of either, ignoring the fact that the two events are actually unrelated to one another. To understand this with regards to Lavender linguistics, just because two individuals are both self-identified bisexual males {{does not necessarily mean that}} they must engage in the same linguistic patterns and social styles. The failure to capture this asymmetry between prototypical and non-prototypical cases results in ineffective study of Lavender linguistics. Typical and salient examples are just two kinds of metonymic models. Others include social stereotypes, ideal cases, paragons, generators, and submodels.|$|E
