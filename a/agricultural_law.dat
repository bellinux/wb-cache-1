25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the Faroes were already colonized as early as 650. The first inhabitants, who were of Celtic descent, were driven out by Norse landnamsmen in about 825. Faroese society in the Viking Age and the Middle Ages resembled the other Nordic populations in many ways. This was particularly true when it came to legislation. The most important body of law was the Gulatingslógin, an ancient Norwegian <b>agricultural</b> <b>law</b> which originated in the Gulating legislative area in Vestlandet in Norway. Originally, this law was preserved through oral tradition, but it was written down about the year 1100.|$|E

2500|$|The Board of Agriculture was {{established}} by Act of Parliament in 1889. [...] Although rationing during the First World War {{was limited to the}} end of 1917 and 1918, a change of mood arose about food security, and the Ministry of Food was created in 1916. [...] There was a national feeling that a man who had fought for his country should be entitled to retire to a smallholding on British land that would provide him with a livelihood. [...] This led to various initiatives, collectively called Homes for Heroes. [...] By 1926 <b>agricultural</b> <b>law</b> had become openly redistributive in favour of ex-servicemen. County Councils had compulsory purchase powers to requisition land they could let as smallholdings. [...] Ex-servicemen were the preferred tenants. [...] The tenant could then buy the land and could ask the Council to lend them money to fund the purchase as a mortgage. [...] The Council could not refuse without the Minister of Agriculture's permission.|$|E
2500|$|The Agriculture Act 1947 broadly revamped <b>agricultural</b> <b>law.</b> [...] It was a {{reaction}} to the privations of the Second World War, and was aimed at food security, so as {{to reduce the risk of}} a hostile foreign power being able to starve the UK into submission. [...] The Act guaranteed prices, markets and tenure, so that a farmer could be assured that his land would not be taken away and whatever he grew would be sold at a known price. [...] Yet another consolidating Agricultural Holdings Act followed it in 1948. [...] These Acts made it harder to evict tenant farmers. [...] With the new security tenants enjoyed, a system of rent reviews was necessary to take account of land price inflation. [...] There were many other changes in the law, and each of these Acts needed negotiations between the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Farmers Union (NFU) to fix the support price to be paid for each agricultural product. [...] They were enacted in a series of Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts in 1949, 1954, 1963, 1968 and 1972.|$|E
5000|$|Simply put, <b>agricultural</b> <b>law</b> is {{the study}} of the special laws and {{regulations}} that apply to the production and sale of agricultural products. [...] "Agricultural exceptionalism," [...] i.e., the use of legal exceptions to protect the agricultural industry, is pervasive, worldwide. [...] American law schools and legal scholars first recognized <b>agricultural</b> <b>law</b> as a discipline in the 1940s when law schools at Yale, Harvard, Texas, and Iowa explored and initiated <b>agricultural</b> <b>law</b> courses. These early efforts were short-lived, however, and <b>agricultural</b> <b>law</b> as a distinct discipline did not resurface for three decades. In 1979, a scholarly journal, The <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Law</b> Journal was initiated. In 1980, the American <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Law</b> Association was formed and an advanced law degree program, the LL.M. Program in <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Law</b> was founded at the University of Arkansas School of Law. In 1981, a fifteen volume <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Law</b> Treatise was published and in 1985, the first law school casebook, Agricultural Law: Cases and Materials was published by West Publishing.|$|E

[...] The Jerusalem Talmud has a greater focus on the Land of Israel and the Torah's <b>agricultural</b> <b>laws</b> pertaining to the land because it was written in the Land of Israel where the laws applied.|$|R

In 2010, the second law school textbook was published with the title, Food, Farming & Sustainability: Readings in <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Law.</b> And, in 2012, the American Association of Law Schools changed the name of its <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Law</b> section to Agricultural and Food Law.

The main conclusion reached is that despite the good intentions and public interests pursued by these <b>agricultural</b> land expropriation <b>laws,</b> they are draconian, and inconsistent with the due process, non-discrimination, and compensation conditions of expropriation.

However, Talmudic texts often deal with laws outside these apparent subject categories. As a result, Jewish law came to be categorized in other ways in the post-Talmudic period.|$|R
