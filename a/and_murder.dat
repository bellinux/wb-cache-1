40|$|In this study, we {{described}} different accidents, drowning <b>and</b> <b>murders</b> as {{the main}} cause of death among 145 composers. We included accidents (48 composers), drowning (26 composers) <b>and</b> <b>murders</b> (71 composers) which were mainly fatal, and premature. Accidents are the third leading cause of deaths today. Murders were often during the wars and revolutions (World War I, II, French, Russian revolution). We mentioned all of the etiologies of these accidents, drowning <b>and</b> <b>murders</b> according to the chronological order of their occurrence. Accidents, drowning <b>and</b> <b>murders</b> caused chiefly a sudden interruption of the composer’s creative work. Composers involved in these accidents died prematurely at the average age of 46. 7 years, whereas murdered composers died at the average age of. 44. 4 years, and drowned 44, 1 years. It is important to conclude that almost 15 % of composers died from accidents, drowning <b>and</b> <b>murders.</b> Poisonings - intoxications and suicides were elaborated in previous publications...|$|R
