40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect of an <b>antianxiety</b> <b>drug,</b> buspirone on blood glucose and plasma insulin level concerning the role of 5 -HT 1 A receptors in blood glucose regulation in healthy humans. Twelve healthy male volunteers were administered single oral doses of buspirone (10 mg) or placebo, in a randomized, crossover way, followed by oral glucose load (75 gm in 200 ml) at reported Tmax i. e. the time of peak plasma concentration of the respective administered drug. The blood samples were collected as predose, postdose and post oral glucose load at 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5 and 3. 0 hr to investigate the effect of buspirone or placebo at basal blood glucose and plasma insulin level and after oral glucose load induced (postprandial) blood glucose and plasma insulin level. Blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations were estimated by glucose hexokinase method and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method respectively. The concentration of blood glucose was significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased after oral glucose load following administration of buspirone in comparison with placebo however no significant change was observed in the fasting blood glucose and plasma insulin (fasting and oral glucose load induced) level. In conclusions, the present study findings show that buspirone produced a significant alteration in blood glucose level in healthy humans. In addition, study results also indicate that the involvement of serotonergic (5 -HT 1 receptors) mechanism of blood glucose regulation in humans is different from animals.

Both these drugs and antidepressive drugs must be used concomitantly with nondrug therapy. The antidepressive drugs are most effective for endogenous depressions, which are probably genetically transmitted and based on a disorder of central neurotransmission. Commoner types of depressions may respond to a wider variety of drugs: stimulants, antianxiety agents, or even small doses of antipsychotic drugs.

Studies were done to test whether treatment with <b>antianxiety</b> <b>drugs</b> would reduce stress and shorten the latency to find the hidden seeds. Prior to testing, the animals were fasted for 18 - 20 h. Ninety minutes after intraperitoneal injection of test drugs (fluoxetine, buspirone, chlordiazepoxide, clozapine, desipramine, yohimbine), the animals were taken from their home cage and placed into a novel holding cage for 2 min. During their absence, 6 sunflower seeds were buried under the bedding {{in one corner of}} their home cage. The animals were placed back into their home cage and timed for their latency to find the seeds in a 5 -min observation period. Treatment with anxiolytics caused a dose-dependent reduction in the latency to find the sunflower seed, while treatment with other psychotherapeutics were ineffective. Seed finding is an extremely sensitive bioassay, responding to anxiolytics given in doses as low as 1 microg/kg.

40|$|Schizophrenia, major depression, {{and anxiety}} {{disorders}} {{are the major}} psychiatric diseases. Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disorder that affects about 1 percent in the world. Symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, movement disorders, flat affect, social withdrawal, and cognitive deficits. Although the causes of this disease {{have not yet been}} determined, current treatments with antipsychotic drugs can eliminate the part of the symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Major depression is disabling and prevents a person from functioning normally. An episode of major depression may occur only once in a person's lifetime, but more often, it recurs throughout a person's life. A variety of treatments including antidepressant medications and short-term psychotherapies are proven effective for major depression. Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and social phobia (social anxiety disorder). Anxiety disorders are treated with medications (e. g., antidepressants, <b>antianxiety</b> <b>drugs,</b> �-adrenergic blockers), specific types (e. g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) of psychotherapy, or both. Alzheimer’s disease is also a serious brain disorder named for German physician Alois Alzheimer, who first described it in 1906.

In this study, we evaluated the salivary cortisol and chromogranin A (CgA) levels of patients with BMS in comparison with age-matched controls. Subjects (n = 114) included 81 BMS patients and 33 controls. Patients with BMS were further classified into a subgroup of subjects who occasionally feel a burning sensation (BMS 1), and a subgroup of subjects who always feel a burning sensation (BMS 2). Salivary cortisol and CgA levels were measured using ELISA kits. All individuals with BMS had significantly higher cortisol and CgA levels than the controls did. Furthermore, when comparing the controls with each BMS subgroup, salivary levels of cortisol were significantly higher in both subgroups than controls. In contrast, the level of CgA was significantly higher in the BMS 2 subgroup only. Multiple regression analysis revealed a significant independent association between salivary levels of cortisol and BMS even after adjustment for gender, antidepressant or <b>antianxiety</b> <b>drug</b> use and hypertension (drug-treated).

40|$|Transmembrane protein 168 (TMEM 168) {{comprises}} 697 {{amino acid}} residues, including some putative transmembrane domains. It is reported that TMEM 168 controls methamphetamine (METH) dependence in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice. Moreover, a strong link between METH dependence-induced adaptive {{changes in the}} brain and mood disorders has been evaluated. In the present study, we investigated the effects of accumbal TMEM 168 in a battery of behavioral paradigms. The adeno-associated virus (AAV) Tmem 168 vector was injected into the NAc of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice (NAc-TMEM mice). Subsequently, the accumbal TMEM 168 mRNA was increased approximately by seven-fold when compared with the NAc-Mock mice (controls). The NAc-TMEM mice reported no change in the locomotor activity, cognitive ability, social interaction, and depression-like behaviors; however, TMEM 168 overexpression enhanced anxiety in the elevated-plus maze and light/dark box test. The increased anxiety was reversed by pretreatment with the <b>antianxiety</b> <b>drug</b> diazepam (0. 3 mg/kg i. p.). Moreover, the NAc-TMEM mice exhibited decreased prepulse inhibition (PPI) in the startle response test, and the induced schizophrenia-like behavior was reversed by pretreatment with the antipsychotic drug risperidone (0. 01 mg/kg i. p.). Furthermore, accumbal TMEM 168 overexpression decreased the basal levels of extracellular GABA in the NAc and the high K+ (100 mM) -stimulated GABA elevation; however, the total contents of GABA in the NAc remained unaffected. These results suggest that the TMEM 168 -regulated GABAergic neuronal system in the NAc might become a novel target while studying the etiology of anxiety and sensorimotor gating deficits...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTakotsubo {{cardiomyopathy}} (TTC) is a cardiomyopathy {{associated with}} emotional and physiological stress {{which can be}} recurrent. We report a case of recurrent TTC (total 3 times) induced by emotional stress, which was diagnosed accurately by coronary angiography (CAG) and left ventriculography (LVG). A 77 -year-old female was referred to our institute because of stomach ache, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting. She had developed TTC associated with emotional stress twice, and she took an angiotensin receptor blocker for preventing recurrence. She was admitted for treatment of electrolyte imbalance. After the admission, she suddenly suffered from chest pain with ST segment elevation in II, III, aVF, V 3, V 4, V 5, and V 6 leads in electrocardiography. Emergency CAG showed normal coronary arteries, while LVG revealed apical akinesia and basal hyperkinesia. These findings were compatible with TTC. Follow-up ultrasonic cardiogram showed left ventricular contractile normalization in a week. She was discharged in 22 days. A few cases of repeated recurrence have been reported, {{but they were not}} diagnosed by cardiac catheterization. In the present case, 3 episodes of TTC were all diagnosed in CAG and LVG. We suggest that <b>antianxiety</b> <b>drugs</b> have potential to prevent the recurrence of TTC in a case induced by emotional stress. <Learning objective: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a cardiomyopathy associated with emotional and physiological stress which can be recurrent.

40|$|Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) {{is a serious}} and global problem, a psychiatric disorder that frequently occurs with different comorbidities, and {{is associated with a}} high suicide rate. Pathophysiologically, both PTSD and suicidal behavior are related to disturbances in the central serotonergic system. Serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) controls emotional behavior, anxiety, impulsivity and aggression, and nearly all known antidepressants and <b>antianxiety</b> <b>drugs</b> affect 5 -HT transmission. Platelet 5 -HT {{can be used as a}} limited peripheral marker of the central serotonergic synaptosomes, since it is related to particular basic psychopathological characteristics of several psychiatric disorders. Platelet 5 -HT concentration has been reported to be similar in PTSD subjects and healthy controls, but suicidal patients across different psychiatric diagnoses have reduced platelet 5 -HT concentration. This study examined platelet 5 -HT concentration by the spectrofluorimetric method in male subjects: 73 suicidal and 47 non-suicidal veterans with current and chronic combat related PTSD, 45 suicidal and 30 non-suicidal comparative non-PTSD subjects and 147 healthy men. The presence of suicidal behavior (score= 0, non-suicidal; scores >/= 1, suicidal) was assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale- 17 (HDRS). Platelet 5 -HT concentration was significantly lower in suicidal PTSD and non-PTSD patients compared to non-suicidal patients or healthy controls. Since the majority of patients scored very low on item 3 of HDRS, no significant correlation between suicidal scores and platelet 5 -HT concentration was found. These results show that reduced platelet 5 -HT concentration is related to suicidal behavior in PTSD, and suggest that platelet 5 -HT concentration might be used as a peripheral marker to predict suicidal behavior across psychiatric diagnoses...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a study to}} {{determine}} if a theatre activity should improve well-being and reduce drug utilization in inmates is described. The study was conducted at the Casa di Reclusione prison of Fossombrone (Marche, Italy), using the Italian version of the Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) Index and the consumption of psychotropic drugs as evaluative instruments. The psychological impairment of inmates is an obvious consequence of their lack of freedom. It is also well known that in prison the consumption of <b>antianxiety</b> and psychotropic <b>drugs</b> is very high with respect to the general population 1 - 4. The healthcare budget dedicated to the Italian prison system has been steadily reduced over the last twenty years, and a reversal in this trend is not foreseen. Given this dire budgetary situation, not to mention general ethical considerations, improving the health of inmates should be a priority. For these reasons, the School of Pharmacy of the University of Urbino “Carlo Bo” (Marche, Italy), the Italian Ministry of Justice and the Casa di Relusione prison in Fossombrone (March, Italy) have collaborated over the last three in a study developed to verify if the involvement of inmates characterized by a high level of psychological impairment in a 1. 5 -year theatre activity can improve their feeling of well-being together with a reduction of drug consumption...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2006 by the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. Although {{the hormone}} relaxin was {{discovered}} 80 years ago, {{only in the}} past 5 years have the receptors for relaxin and three other receptors that respond to related peptides been identified with all four receptors being G-protein-coupled receptors. In this review it is suggested that the receptors for relaxin (LGR 7) and those for the related peptides insulin-like peptide 3 (LGR 8), relaxin- 3 (GPCR 135), and insulin-like peptide 5 (LGPCR 142) be named the relaxin family peptide receptors 1 through 4 (RXFP 1 - 4). RXFP 1 and RXFP 2 are leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptors with complex binding characteristics involving both the large ectodomain and the transmembrane loops. RXFP 1 activates adenylate cyclase, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, and extracellular signaling regulated kinase (Erk 1 / 2) and also interacts with nitric oxide signaling. RXFP 2 activates adenylate cyclase in recombinant systems, but physiological responses are sensitive to pertussis toxin. RXFP 3 and RXFP 4 resemble more conventional peptide liganded receptors and both inhibit adenylate cyclase, and in addition RXFP 3 activates Erk 1 / 2 signaling. Physiological studies and examination of the phenotypes of transgenic mice have established that relaxin has roles as a reproductive hormone involved in uterine relaxation (some species), reproductive tissue growth, and collagen remodeling but also in the cardiovascular and renal systems and in the brain. The connective tissue remodeling properties of relaxin acting at RXFP 1 receptors have potential for the development of agents effective for the treatment of cardiac and renal fibrosis, asthma, and scleroderma and for orthodontic remodelling. Agents acting at RXFP 2 receptors may be useful for the treatment of cryptorchidism and infertility, whereas antagonists may be used as contraceptives. The brain distribution of RXFP 3 receptors suggests that actions at these receptors have the potential for the development of <b>antianxiety</b> and antiobesity <b>drugs.</b> Ross A.
