25|$|Merleau-Ponty {{demonstrates}} a corporeity of consciousness {{as much as}} an intentionality of the body, and so stands in contrast with the dualist ontology of mind and body in Descartes, a philosopher to whom Merleau-Ponty continually returned, despite the important differences that separate them. In the Phenomenology of Perception Merleau-Ponty wrote: “Insofar as I have hands, feet; a body, I sustain around me intentions which are not dependent on my decisions and which <b>affect</b> <b>my</b> surroundings in a way that I do not choose” (1962, p.440).|$|E
500|$|Turner {{stated that}} she was on a [...] "downhill slide" [...] for much of the 1970s, {{drinking}} heavily, not eating, missing performances, and weighing only 95 pounds. [...] "I was a sipper but I never got high or drunk," [...] Turner said in a 1982 interview. [...] "It was much more insidious. It was starting to <b>affect</b> <b>my</b> liver and my health... I was very sick." [...] She decided to stop drinking, and began eating all organic food; she would credit herbalism as helping her overcome her alcoholism. Turner claimed she was chaste for the remainder of her life, after her final divorce in 1969 and had no desire to marry again.|$|E
500|$|Sobers {{told the}} media that he had played in Rhodesia as he felt {{it would be good}} for cricket, {{particularly}} after the cancellation of the South African tour of England, and that politics had not entered his mind. He told interviewers that he had had no problems whatsoever in Rhodesia, that sport in Rhodesia appeared to him to be integrated and that he intended to accept Smith's invitation to return there in the future to play more cricket. Reporting Bacher's suggestion of playing in South Africa, Sobers said that he probably would not do so: [...] "I don't know if I would want to get involved in that," [...] he said, [...] "but it does show that South African cricketers are willing to play with and against players of any colour, race or creed." [...] Sobers said that the white South African members of the Rest of the World squad in England had functioned well as part of the multiracial team, and that he hoped for a similar Rest of the World series in the Caribbean as he believed West Indian cricket fans would enjoy seeing the South African players. He expressed confusion regarding the calls for him to be stripped of his captaincy. [...] "I am a professional cricketer and a sportsman, not a politician," [...] he said. [...] "I went to play cricket. I don't see why this should <b>affect</b> <b>my</b> position as captain of the West Indies team." ...|$|E

[...] Harman stated that while she did support the equalisation of the age of consent for gay men she had never campaigned for the age of consent to go below the age of 16 and accused the Daily Mail of trying to make her [...] "guilty by way of association".|$|E

2500|$|During {{depositions}} for the case, Trump told {{attorneys in}} December 2007, [...] "My net worth fluctuates, {{and it goes}} {{up and down with}} markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings." [...] Trump clarified, [...] "Yes, even my own feelings as to where the world is, where the world is going, and that can change rapidly from day to day. Then you have a September 11th, and you don't feel so good about yourself and you don't feel so good about the world and you don't feel so good about New York City.

5000|$|On October 10, 2012, Toyota {{announced}} a recall of 7.43 million vehicles (2.47 {{million in the}} US, 460,000 in Japan, 1.39 million in Europe, 3.11 million in other markets) worldwide. In the US the recall <b>affects</b> <b>MY</b> 2005-2010 Yaris, Corolla, Matrix, Camry, RAV4, Highlander, Tundra and Sequoia as well as Scion xB and xD. In Japan the recall <b>affects</b> <b>MY</b> 2005-2010 Vitz, Belta, Ractis, Ist and Corolla Rumion. In Europe the recall <b>affects</b> <b>MY</b> 2005-2010 Yaris, Corolla, Auris, Camry and RAV-4. Vehicles in overseas markets are also affected. The recall concerns {{a problem with the}} driver's side power window switch that [...] "sticks" [...] and could lead it to melt or catch fire. It is [...] "not something that would cause any deadly accidents like the recall of 2009" [...] and repairs include the application of a special fluorine grease to the switch.|$|R
2500|$|In other words, [...] "provoking disbelief in free will" [...] {{probably}} {{causes a}} belief in fatalism. As discussed earlier in this article, compatibilistic free will is illustrated by statements like [...] "my choices have causes, and an effect – so I <b>affect</b> <b>my</b> future", whereas fatalism is more like [...] "my choices have causes, but no effect – I am powerless". Fatalism, then, may be what threatens people's sense of self-efficacy. Lay people should not confuse fatalism with determinism, and yet even professional philosophers occasionally confuse the two. It is thus likely that the negative consequences below can {{be accounted for by}} participants developing {{a belief in}} fatalism when experiments attack belief in [...] "free will". To test the effects of belief in determinism, future studies would need to provide articles that do not simply [...] "attack free will", but instead focus on explaining determinism and compatibilism. Some studies have been conducted indicating that people react strongly {{to the way in which}} mental determinism is described, when reconciling it with moral responsibility. Eddy Nahmias has noted that when people's actions are framed with respect to their beliefs and desires (rather than their neurological underpinnings), they are more likely to dissociate determinism from moral responsibility.|$|E
2500|$|Vedder was a {{close friend}} of late Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman, Chris Cornell. Cornell {{was one of the first}} people Vedder met outside his Pearl Jam bandmates after moving to Seattle in 1990. The two were neighbors for a while and had shared vocal duties in Temple of The Dog. Soundgarden manager Susan Silver {{recalled}} in the 2009 book Grunge Is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music, that Cornell walked Vedder onstage at Pearl Jam (then named Mookie Blaylock)'s second show in Seattle, [...] "Alice in Chains filmed the show at Moore theatre in 1990 and that was the show this new band [...] opened for them. Everyone was still reeling from Andy ’s death... and they hadn’t really played out yet. The band came on and Chris carried Eddie onto the stage – he was on his shoulders. It was one of those super powerful moments, where it was all a big healing for everybody. He came out as this guy who had all the credibility in the world – in terms of people in Seattle – and Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone were loved bands. Andy was such an endearing personality. It was a hard thing to do – to show up after people die. And Chris bringing Eddie out, and pointing at him, as much to say, ‘This is your guy now’. Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready said about their friendship; [...] "Ed was from San Diego and he felt very intimidated in Seattle. Chris really welcomed him. Ed was super, super shy. Chris took him out for beers and told him stories. He was like, [...] "Hey, welcome to Seattle. I love Jeff [...] and Stone [...] I give you my blessing." [...] From then on he was more relaxed. It was one of the coolest things I saw Chris do.". In a 2009 interview with Uncut magazine, Vedder stated that Cornell is [...] "the best singer that we've got on the planet". About the impact that Cornell had in his life, Vedder told a crowd in Alpine Valley before performing [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] with him in September 2011; “I had no idea how he would <b>affect</b> <b>my</b> life and my views on music and my views on friendship and what a big impact he would have. These guys [...] know him much longer than me and his impact is profound”. The friendship between Vedder and Cornell is also featured in the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty. During his solo concert in London on June 6, 2017, Vedder talked for the first time about Cornell since his death on May 18, 2017, saying that [...] "he wasn't just a friend, he was someone I looked up to like my older brother" [...] and [...] "I will live with those memories in my heart and I will love him forever".|$|E
