5|$|Gout {{can present}} in {{multiple}} ways, although the most usual is a recurrent attack of acute inflammatory arthritis (a red, tender, hot, swollen joint). The metatarsal-phalangeal joint {{at the base}} of the big toe is affected most often, accounting for half of cases. Other joints, such as the heels, knees, wrists <b>and</b> <b>fingers,</b> may also be affected. Joint pain usually begins over 2–4hours and during the night. This is mainly due to lower body temperature. Other symptoms may rarely occur along with the joint pain, including fatigue and a high fever.|$|E

A serpent may be depicted in his matted hair, which is also adorned by the crescent moon. His forehead bears a tripundara, the Shaiva tilaka composed of three horizontal lines of sacred ash with a red dot in the middle representing the third eye. He wears a patta (ornamental head band)—sometimes adorned with a human skull motif—on his forehead. Snake ornaments adorn his body, and bronze images often depict multiple necklaces, a waist-band, armlets, elbow bands, bracelets, anklets, and rings on all his toes <b>and</b> <b>fingers.</b> A snake is also tied around his waist and a white yagnopavita (sacred thread) is worn across the chest.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls like Sclerocephalus {{are known}} from both large adult {{specimens}} and small larvae, showing an extreme change in body shape. In these species, {{the shape and}} proportions of skull bones change {{in the early stages}} of development. The ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time. Small, regularly spaced pits are the first to form, followed by larger ridges. As development continues, the external gills disappear. Small teeth that once covered the palate are lost. The postcranial skeleton does not develop at the same rate as the skull, with ossification (the replacement of cartilage by bone) happening more slowly. Vertebrae and limb bones are poorly developed, ribs <b>and</b> <b>fingers</b> are absent in the early stages, and the scapulocoracoid and ischium are entirely absent through most of development. Once maturity is reached, most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows. The bones of some temnospondyls like Dutuitosaurus show growth marks, possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons. Fossils of temnospondyls like Metoposaurus and Cheliderpeton show that individuals grew larger past maturity. The oldest individuals usually have more pitting on their skulls with deeper sulci.|$|E

This study proposes a survey of multimodal fingerprint <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> vein recognition techniques. Most of the existing work is systematically described and compared in five parts, i. e., fingerprint <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> vein image acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, feature matching and fusion. According to the available work in literatures and commercial utilization experiences, fingerprint <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> vein multimodality ensures higher performance and spoofing resistance.

40|$|Sorghum <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> millet are two {{important}} cereal crops for farmers in semi-arid areas in Eastern Africa. Both crops are traditionally cultivated for home consumption, {{but in recent}} years market demand has increased. This offers new opportunities for smallholders to commercialize production, which is seen as a pathway for prosperity in the dry lands. The HOPE project aims to support smallholder commercialization in Eastern Africa. Understanding consumption patterns for sorghum <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> millet is important for this objective. The purpose of the consumer survey in Kenya and Tanzania was to provide an overview of sorghum <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> millet consumption compared to maize and wheat, and to understand reasons for consumption and non-consumption, in order to help develop strategies to promote sorghum <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> millet consumption. In Kenya, a total of 454 consumers were interviewed. Two urban centres (Nairobi and Kisii) and two rural locations (villages nearby selected urban locations), one each in a sorghum <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> millet production <b>and</b> non-production area were selected for the survey. At each location, consumers were interviewed at three different market outlets (supermarkets, small retail shops and open-air markets). In addition, Nairobi was stratified into three different strata (low, middle and high income) to capture consumption habits of different income areas of the city. The majority of respondents in Kenya consume sorghum <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> millet on a monthly basis. However, finger millet is more widely consumed than sorghum. For both crops, the highest share of consumers is found in rural areas where the crop is grown. In the case of sorghum, rural areas in non-production zones rank second, followed by urban areas in production zones. Urban areas in non-production zones (Nairobi) have the lowest share of sorghum consumers. For finger millet, urban areas in production zones rank second, followed by rural areas in non-production zones. Nairobi again ranks last. In Nairobi, high income areas have lowest share of sorghum <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> millet consumers. Maize is consumed by almost all respondents and wheat by the vast majority and by a higher share of respondents than sorghum <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> millet. The mean amount consumed in a month is also highest for maize. This holds true in all settings. Wheat ranks second <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> millet <b>and</b> sorghum third and fourth, respectivel...|$|R
