25|$|In the Cairo museum may be {{seen the}} statue of {{a man from the}} period of the Great Pyramid of Giza, {{possibly}} 4000 B.C. The expression of the face and the realism of the carriage have never been surpassed by any Egyptian sculptor of this or any other period. The figure is carved out of a solid block of sycamore, and in accordance with the Egyptian custom the arms are joined on. The eyes are inlaid with pieces of opaque white quartz, with a line of bronze surrounding to imitate the lid; a small disk of transparent rock crystal forms the iris, while <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> of polished ebony fixed behind the crystal imparts to it a lifelike sparkle. The IV., V. and VI. dynasties cover the finest period of Egyptian sculpture. The statues found in the tombs show a freedom of treatment which was never reached in later times. They are all portraits, which the artist strove his utmost to render exactly like his model. For these are not, like mere modern statues, simply works of art, but had primarily a religious signification (Maspero). As the spirits of the deceased might inhabit, these Ka statues, the features and proportions were closely copied.|$|E
500|$|B. edulis is {{considered}} one of the safest wild mushrooms to pick for the table, as no poisonous species closely resemble it. The most similar poisonous mushroom may be the devil's bolete (Rubroboletus satanas), which has a similar shape, but has a red stem and stains blue on bruising. It is often confused with the very bitter and unpalatable Tylopilus felleus, but can be distinguished by the reticulation on the stalk; in porcini, it is a whitish, net-like pattern on a brownish stalk, whereas it is a dark pattern on white in the latter. Porcini have whitish pores while the other has pink. If in doubt, tasting <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> of flesh will yield a bitter taste. It can also resemble the [...] "bolete-like" [...] Gyroporus castaneus, which is generally smaller, and has a browner stem.|$|E

500|$|These {{were ready}} in February 1940, and Dunning, Eugene T. Booth and Aristid von Grosse then {{carried out a}} series of experiments. They {{demonstrated}} that uranium-235 was indeed primarily responsible for fission with slow neutrons, but were unable to determine precise neutron capture cross sections because their samples were not sufficiently enriched. Pegram forwarded the results to Briggs on March 11, 1940; they were subsequently published to the Physical Reviews March 15 and April 15, 1940 issues. [...] Briggs reported to Watson on April 9 that it was doubtful that a chain reaction could be initiated in uranium without uranium enrichment, and therefore urged that research be undertaken into isotope separation technology. Nier, Booth, Dunning and von Grosse's [...] results were discussed by Jesse Beams, Ross Gunn, Fermi, Nier, Merle Tuve and Harold Urey at the spring meeting of the American Physical Society in Washington, D.C., in the last week of April 1940. The New York Times reported that conferees argued [...] "the probability of some scientist blowing up a sizable portion of the earth with <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> of uranium." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1980 Donen {{made the}} science fiction film Saturn 3, {{starring}} Kirk Douglas, Farrah Fawcett and Harvey Keitel. Donen first {{read the script}} when its writer (and Movie Movies set designer) John Barry showed it to him, prompting Donen to pass it along to Lew Grade. Donen was initially hired to produce, but Grade asked him to complete the film when first-time director Barry was unable to direct. According to Donen [...] "only <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> of what Barry shot {{ended up in the}} finished film." [...] It was a critical and financial disaster and initially Donen {{did not want to be}} credited as director. In the early 1980s Donen was attached to direct an adaptation of Stephen King's The Dead Zone and worked with writer Jeffrey Boam on the script. Donen eventually dropped out of the project and David Cronenberg directed the film a few years later. Boam stated that Donen was initially attracted to making the film because he wanted to [...] "connect with contemporary youthful audiences" [...] and that the script that they worked on together was [...] "very close to the script that David wound up making." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{morning after}} the November 2015 Paris attacks, German pianist Davide Martello brought a grand piano to the street {{out in front of}} the Bataclan, where 89 concertgoers had been shot dead the night before, and {{performed}} an instrumental version to honour the victims of the attacks; video of his performance went viral. This led Katy Waldman of Slate to ponder why [...] "Imagine" [...] had become so frequently performed as a response to tragedy. In addition to its general popularity, she noted its musical simplicity, its key of C major, [...] "the plainest and least complicated key, with no sharps or flats" [...] aside from one passage with [...] "a plaintive major seventh chord that allows <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> of E minor into the tonic". That piano part, [...] "gentle as a rocking chair", underpins lyrics that, Waldman says, [...] "belongs to the tradition of hymns or spirituals that visualize a glorious afterlife without prophesizing any immediate end to suffering on earth". This understanding is also compounded by the historical context of Lennon's own violent death, [...] "remind us that the universe can run ramshod over idealistic people". Ultimately, the song [...] "captures the fragility of our hope after a violent or destructive event ... t also reveals its tenacity".|$|E

When it was handed over to Top Gear's 'tame racing driver', The Stig, it completed a lap of their circuit in 1:22.5, a time faster than a Ferrari F430 (1:22.9), and an Audi R8 (1:24.4). It was praised by Jeremy Clarkson, who called it [...] "one of those Giant Killers." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Stinky Puffs were {{an early}} 90's rock band started by then seven-year-old Simon Fair Timony, then-stepson of Jad Fair, and by Cody Linn Ranaldo, son of Sonic Youth guitarist Lee Ranaldo.

500|$|Critical {{response}} to the character has been mixed. BuddyTV staff columnist Don Williams deemed the addition of Bela a [...] "cheap ploy" [...] to attract teen male viewers, believing the character distracts viewers from the [...] "brotherly bond that made the show so special in the first place". As well, he felt her [...] "sexy cat burglar act, coupled with her flirtation with one of our heroes, is cliched and has been seen a thousand times before", and he likened her {{to a combination of}} Catwoman and [...] "the equally annoying Electro-Gwen from Angel". However, he later admitted Bela was [...] "a great comic foil". Diana Steenbergen of IGN became [...] "increasingly frustrated" [...] with the [...] "unlikable and manipulative" [...] Bela throughout her appearances. She found the character's tragic backstory to be [...] "too little, too late", but was surprised the writers were able to make her feel [...] "even <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> sorry for [...] " [...] during her death scene. Writing that [...] "Bela had a hint of vulnerability that would have been intriguing had we glimpsed it more than 30 seconds before she died", Steenbergen wished the character had been written differently"not either annoying or downright contemptible"and deemed her [...] "a wasted opportunity to give us an interesting female foil for the boys". Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune expressed similar sentiments, voicing her belief in her review of the third season finale [...] "No Rest For The Wicked" [...] that Bela [...] "got gone just as [...] getting interesting". In the same review, Peterson deemed the character to be a [...] "decent traveling [...] ". Although TV Guide's Tina Charles was annoyed that Bela continuously steals from the Winchesters and makes them [...] "look ridiculous", she [...] "really liked" [...] the character. Overall, she felt Cohan [...] "did one hell of a job".|$|E
500|$|Heigl {{believes}} that the Grey's Anatomy writers incorporate much of the actors' personalities into their roles, and that Izzie is a [...] "super moral" [...] version of herself. Episode [...] "Bring the Pain", which aired as the fifth episode of the second season, was originally intended {{to be the final}} episode of the first season. Rhimes explained that Izzie's character in this episode came [...] "full circle" [...] from her role in the pilot: [...] "Izzie, so vulnerable and underestimated when we first meet her, is the girl who removes her heart from her sleeve in [...] "Bring the Pain"." [...] Discussing Izzie's personality in a 2006 Cosmopolitan interview, Heigl assessed that she is [...] "immensely kind" [...] and patient. When Denny died in the season two episode [...] "Losing My Religion", Rhimes discussed the impact it had on Izzie, noting that Izzie is forced to abandon her idealism, which in turn leads to her letting go of medicine. In the aftermath of Denny's death, Heigl came to believe that Izzie was not cut out to be a doctor. Executive producer Betsy Beers explained, however, that Denny's death served to make Izzie more mature, and Heigl affirmed that [...] "At the beginning of the [...] season they were trying to show how lost Izzie was. She lost her optimism. She realizes now that life is difficult, but she still tries very hard to see the best in people." [...] In order to demonstrate Izzie's dislike of George's love-interest Callie, Rhimes penned a scene which she deemed one of her favorite moments on the show, in which Callie urinates in front of a stunned Izzie and Meredith. Rhimes assessed that: [...] "I love that Mer and Izzie respond with all the trauma of having viewed [...] a car crash [...] the point is Callie pees and Izzie tortures her <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> about the hand washing and that made me overjoyed because that’s the kind of thing people do." ...|$|E

5000|$|On 13 July 1923, the Waterloo County Pioneers' Memorial Association {{was formed}} with the {{patronage}} of the Waterloo Historical Society, and {{its board of}} directors included its members and descendants of the first Mennonite families to move to the area. The tower was conceived by William Henry Breithaupt, president of the association, who wanted to commemorate the Mennonites who had moved to the area (and also the first farmers of Waterloo Region), and to heal the wounds of earlier nationalism that led to the city's name change. Breithaupt, according to local historian Rych Mills, [...] "was trying to just re-jig our history <b>a</b> little <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> because of all the troubles we went through in World War One." [...] A group petitioned the council of the County of Wellington to build the tower.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> Little <b>Tiny</b> Smelly <b>Bit</b> of... The Stinky Puffs is The Stinky Puffs first release {{following}} the band's self-titled debut in 1991. It includes four songs {{recorded in the}} studio, followed by the same four songs recorded live at the Capitol Theater in Olympia, Washington {{as part of the}} Yoyo A Go Go Festival in July 1994. [...] "Pizza Break" [...] acts as an intermission between the two recordings. The album is notable for containing the first live performances of Nirvana members Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl {{following the}} death of Kurt Cobain, whom the track [...] "I'll Love You Anyway" [...] was written about. The live tracks also feature Ira Kaplan of Yo La Tengo.|$|R
50|$|The video {{begins with}} the band walking in a hallway {{in a high school}} and a clown as well {{sometimes}} holding something on his nose. Then the band starts playing in a locker room which appears to be happening at night. Jonathan Davis is seen singing and in some clips he is sitting in the locker room in the dry shower but with a few people spraying <b>a</b> little <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> of water on his hair to tease him. This represents some of his painful experiences in high school of being teased. It also features the band in a gym and clips of jocks in their football jerseys and cheerleaders seen by someone who walks in the halls. One of the cheerleaders goes into the bathroom and starts smiling in the dark room with a little light and starts brushing her hair with her hands. Clips also show the band performing in a dark room. The video ends off with the cheerleader in the bathroom taking off her shirt showing a tattoo on her back showing the band's logo. The music video most likely could be them in a school after a football game at night. The music video aired in 1996 and was directed by McG.|$|R

I guess I pointed a little bit in front, but, you know, what can we say?" [...] Schumacher said [...] "The end of the race was not planned...

2500|$|In a 2012, {{interview}} with LeftLion magazine, Alan Moore {{was asked to}} put a figure on {{how much money he}} had turned down by refusing to be associated with these film adaptations. He estimated it to be 'at least a few million dollars' and said: [...] "You can't buy that kind of empowerment. To just know that as far as you are aware, you have not got a price; that there is not an amount of money large enough to make you compromise even <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> of principle that, as it turned out, would make no practical difference anyway. I'd advise everyone to do it, otherwise you're going to end up mastered by money and that's not a thing you want ruling your life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Helmsley {{was known}} for [...] "tyrannizing her employees". According to Alan Dershowitz, while breakfasting with her {{at one of the}} Helmsley hotels, the waiter brought him a cup of tea with <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> of water spilled on the saucer. She grabbed the cup from him and smashed it on the floor, then demanded that the waiter get down {{on his hands and knees}} and beg for his job." [...] In another account of Helmsley's behavior, she had a {{barbecue}} pit constructed for her home. The work was performed by Eugene Brennan, a personal friend of Jeremiah McCarthy, the chief engineer of Helmsley-Spear. When the final bill came to $13,000, she refused to pay, citing shoddy workmanship. When McCarthy pleaded with her to honor the bill, citing the favor done on his behalf and informing her that Brennan had six children to support, Helmsley replied, [...] "Why didn't he keep his pants on? Then he wouldn't need the money".|$|E

2500|$|Oliver [...] "Ollie" [...] Reeder (Chris Addison) – Series 1-4 – Ollie is {{a special}} adviser to the Secretary of State (formerly junior policy adviser). An Oxbridge {{graduate}} from Lincolnshire, he is arrogant, inept, inexperienced, somewhat gawky, and often inadvertently the cause of departmental mistakes. However, the minister often takes up his ideas believing them to be vote-winners. During series 1 it is revealed that he once {{had a relationship with}} journalist Angela Heaney (Lucinda Raikes) [...] who makes occasional appearances through the first three series. He was seconded to the Prime Minister's Office after he slept with opposition party worker Emma Messinger (Olivia Poulet) and was told to use his relationship to gather information on opposition party policy. He is described by Terri as [...] "a little bit morally bankrupt and massively self centred and <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> dangerously unreliable". In series 4, he is an advisor to Nicola Murray in her capacity as Leader of the Opposition, but schemes with Malcolm to try and force her resignation. In the series conclusion, he takes over from Malcolm as his party's senior communications adviser.|$|E
2500|$|With {{his search}} for [...] "authenticity" [...] in subject and expression, and despite his avant-garde credentials, Bonciu is {{sometimes}} included among the younger-generation Trăirists, alongside Max Blecher, Mircea Eliade, Anton Holban or Mihail Sebastian. Crohmălniceanu, who finds an ultimate source of literary Trăirism in narratives by André Gide, describes Bonciu's novels as [...] "impressive literary documents" [...] of the Trăirist movement. Described as the more experimental voice of this subgenre, and opposed to Holban's conventional approach, Bonciu was also repeatedly compared with a secondary figure in Trăirism, the novelist Constantin Fântâneru. According to reviewer Igor Mocanu, Bonciu, Blecher and Fântâneru share between them a transgression of avant-garde aesthetics and a taste for absurdism: [...] "These three authors would create [...] {{a new way of}} making literature, which took <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> from all the currents and movements of its time. We are dealing with books where, emerging out of an evidently surreal depictions, one comes across dialogues heavily impregnated with the absurd." [...] The Bonciu–Blecher comparison is more controversial: various reviewers have noted that, while Bonciu visualizes the suffering of himself and others, Blecher records his real-life combat with Pott disease.|$|E
