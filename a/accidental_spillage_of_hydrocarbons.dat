40|$|This {{work was}} aimed at {{evaluating}} the feasibility of a remediation treatment performed {{by means of a}} supercritical carbon dioxide extraction on a sandy soil recently contaminated by light polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The soil utilized in this study was artificially contaminated by naphthalene and anthracene. The artificial contamination process was intended to simulate a recent <b>accidental</b> <b>spillage</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> fuels. Several extractions, aimed at singling out the operating parameters (pressure, temperature, supercritical fluid mass flow rate) that are able to obtain the residual required concentration (50 mg/kg dry soil) in the shortest time, were carried out on a on-purpose made system. The best extraction conditions were 120 bar and 40 ◦C for a naphthalene contaminated soil and 200 bar and 80 - 100 ◦C for an anthracene contaminated soil. The results obtained in the experimental tests made it possible to build an analytical model able to correlate, for the given soil, the extraction length to the operating parameters such as supercritical fluid density, temperature and mass flow rate. In order to evaluate the economic feasibility of the process, a unit treatment cost was evaluated for the case of an extraction carried out in a 10 m 3 reactor {{in the presence of the}} best extraction conditions that were previously determined. The extraction unit cost was therefore equal to 35 000 - 65 000 /t for a soil with a starting contaminant concentration equal to 1000 mg/kg of dry soil...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Groundwater is {{the main}} source of {{drinking}} water as well as agricultural and industrial usage. Unfortunately, groundwater quality has been degraded due to improper waste disposal practices and <b>accidental</b> <b>spillage</b> <b>of</b> hazardous chemicals. Therefore, it is critical that the groundwater contamination be prevented and the contaminated groundwater at numerous sites worldwide be remediated in order to protect public health and the environment. This chapter provides an overview of relevant regulations, general remedial approach, and most commonly used physical and chemical groundwater remediation technologies. The remediation technologies include pump-and-treat, in-situ air sparging, in-situ flushing, and permeable reactive barriers. The process description, applicability, limitations and a case study for each of these technologies are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Stable C isotope {{compositions}} of dissolved inorganic C (DIC) and carbonate sediment in a Jamaican river (Rio Cobre), {{are used}} as natural tracers <b>of</b> <b>accidental</b> <b>spillage</b> <b>of</b> bauxite processing liquor and waste water. Bauxite processing produces highly caustic (OH- and CO 2 - 3) liquor and wash waters. These hydroxide-rich waters absorb atmospheric CO 2 that is isotopically fractionated resulting in very negative carbonate d 13 C and d 18 O values. <b>Accidental</b> <b>spillage</b> <b>of</b> these liquors into rivers causes rapid precipitation of CaCO 3 as a fine-grained suspension (‘whiting’) and subsequent deposition as calcite sediment. At the time of DIC sampling ‘whiting’ was not evident; however, d 13 CDIC values at sites {{with a history of}} contamination were about 2 ‰ more negative than ambient values. The history <b>of</b> bauxite processing <b>spillages</b> is recorded in the d 13 C values of carbonate riverbed sediments. At sites known to be impacted, particulate carbonate samples have d 13 C values between - 11. 2 and - 14. 2 ‰; values that are between 1 and 4 ‰ more negative than the predicted ambient d 13 C value. Similarly, d 18 O values of carbonate sediments at impacted sites are on average 2 ‰ more negative than those from sites above and below them, supporting the interpretation that the ‘whiting events’ form precipitates with isotopically negative values. Contamination is quite localized because carbonate sediments downstream of impacted sites show no evidence of anomalous isotope values. This suggests that the particulate carbonate is either flushed or re-dissolves, and is diluted downstream. The carbonate ‘whitings’ are thus highly visual but relatively benign, although the associated pH and dissolved Al 3 + and Na+ flushes might have more serious impacts on the river environment...|$|R

25|$|Though widespread, {{systematic}} contamination by {{hydraulic fracturing}} has been heavily disputed, one {{major source of}} contamination that has the most consensus among researchers of being the most problematic is site-specific <b>accidental</b> <b>spillage</b> <b>of</b> hydraulic fracturing fluid and produced water. So far, a significant majority of groundwater contamination events are derived from surface-level anthropogenic routes rather than the subsurface flow from underlying shale formations.

40|$|A {{pulse of}} {{chromated}} copper arsenate (CCA, a timber preservative) was applied in irrigation water to an undisturbed field soil {{in a laboratory}} column. Concentrations of various elements in the leachate from the column were measured during the experiment. Also, the remnants within the soil were measured {{at the end of}} the experiment. The geochemical modelling package, PHREEQC- 2, was used to simulate the experimental data. Processes included in the CCA transport modelling were advection, dispersion, non-specific adsorption (cation exchange) and specific adsorption by clay minerals and organic matter, as well as other possible chemical reactions such as precipitation/dissolution. The modelling effort highlighted the possible complexities in CCA transport and reaction experiments. For example, the uneven dosing of CCA as well as incomplete knowledge of the soil properties resulted in simulations that gave only partial, although reasonable, agreement with the experimental data. Both the experimental data and simulations show that As and Cu are strongly adsorbed and therefore, will mostly remain at the top of the soil profile, with a small proportion appearing in leachate. On the other hand, Cr is more mobile and thus it is present in the soil column leachate. Further simulations show that both the quantity of CCA added to the soil and the pH of the irrigation water will influence CCA transport. Simulations suggest that application of larger doses of CCA to the soil will result in higher leachate concentrations, especially for Cu and As. Irrigation water with a lower pH will dramatically increase leaching of Cu. These results indicate that acidic rainfall or significant <b>accidental</b> <b>spillage</b> <b>of</b> CCA will increase the risk of groundwater pollution. <br /...|$|R
25|$|The {{advantages}} of manure treatment are {{a reduction in}} the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction. Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. Manure treatment can also reduce the risk of human health and biosecurity risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. Undiluted animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an intestinal parasite, Cryptosporidium, which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. Silage liquor (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to <b>accidental</b> <b>spillage.</b> All <b>of</b> these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.|$|R
40|$|Input of {{contaminants}} {{into the sea}} associated with offshore oil drilling and production include <b>accidental</b> <b>spillage,</b> discharge <b>of</b> cuttings and discharge of production water.

As a control sample, there is no addition of biodiesel and diesel into the sample. All samples were stored in the incubator at 35 ºC throughout the 24 days of treatment. Samples were analyzed for: soil particle size, moisture content, pH, total nitrogen (TN), orthophosphate, sulfate, total organic carbon (TOC), soxhlet extraction of PAHs and enumeration of Pseudomonas putida. The measurement of all testing parameters was carried out at interval of three days starting from Day 0 to Day 24 of bioremediation period. Results showed that the highest removal of total nitrogen (TN), orthophosphate, sulfate, total organic carbon (TOC) and PAHs were observed in the sample B 100 with up to 70. 43 %, 69. 47 %, 68. 08 %, 97. 66 % and 96. 28 % removal, respectively.

The problem lies partly in the fact that a single accidental discharge into a salmonid nursery river can kill many thousands of fish for as much as 20 kilometres downstream. If the downward trend of problems from agriculture and industry can be maintained, the greatest threat in water pollution is likely to be that of enrichment, above all the release of excessive phosphate into the environment. Two sources, fertilizer and domestic sewage, are implicated. The sewage element can be controlled by upgrading treatment plants wherever necessary.
