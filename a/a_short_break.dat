5|$|Binaural is {{the sixth}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Pearl Jam, released on May 16, 2000 through Epic Records. Following a full-scale tour {{in support of}} its previous album, Yield (1998), Pearl Jam took <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>break</b> before reconvening {{toward the end of}} 1999 to begin work on a new album. During the production of the album, the band encountered hindrances such as singer Eddie Vedder's writer's block, and guitarist Mike McCready's entrance into rehabilitation due to an addiction to prescription drugs.|$|E
5|$|In {{between his}} various duties and responsibilities, Nansen had {{continued}} to take skiing holidays when he could. In February 1930, aged 68, he took <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>break</b> in the mountains with two old friends, who noted that Nansen was slower than usual and appeared to tire easily.

On August 19 and 20, they filmed two shows at Luna Park in Buenos Aires, Argentina for a live Blu-ray release.|$|E
5|$|Kiedis {{knew that}} the band's sound would inevitably change when Navarro joined. In June 1994, the band entered The Sound Factory, a {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles, to record the album. The band completed a few basic tracks, when Kiedis began having difficulty singing. He had been through a dental procedure in which an addictive sedative, Valium, was used; this caused him to relapse, and he once again became dependent on drugs. Kiedis had slipped from five years of sobriety and began reusing narcotics he'd sworn never to use again. The band took <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>break</b> from recording to perform at Woodstock '94, {{which was the first}} show Navarro played with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.|$|E

5|$|The Legion took <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>break</b> {{from active}} duty to receive new aircraft, {{including}} Bf 109Es, He 111Es and Js, and Hs 126As, bringing its strength to 96 aircraft, around {{a fifth of}} the Nationalist's force as a whole. Von Richthofen returned to Spain in overall command, with Hans Seidemann as chief of staff. This reinforcement may have been the single most important intervention by a foreign side in the war, enabling a counterattack after the Battle of the Ebro. It mainly took part in operations against the remaining Republican air force during January–February 1939, with considerable success. It was rapidly dissolved. The men returned on 26 May; the best aircraft were returned to Germany {{and the rest of the}} equipment bought by the new Spanish regime.|$|E
5|$|The trails {{through the}} park, {{including}} one for mountain biking, run almost parallel along the ridge. There is a natural pond with fishes and turtles in the north-west of the park. A 280-metre long canopy walk was completed {{in the eastern part}} of the park in October 2003, linking Kent Ridge Park to the war museum, Reflections at Bukit Chandu, enhancing the park's and museum's accessibility to the public. Along the walk, there are information boards providing educational information on the flora and fauna in the park. At the half-way point, there is a shelter for visitors to take <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>break</b> or to enjoy a scenic view of Normanton Park and the National Parks Board's plant nursery.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the federation, Welensky moved to Salisbury, Rhodesia (renamed from Southern Rhodesia after Northern Rhodesia gained independence as Zambia). After <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>break,</b> he was invited to lead the UFP in Rhodesia, which had recently renamed itself the Rhodesia Party. With the Rhodesian Front pushing for independence for the territory and a new constitution, the Rhodesia Party advocated the same, but with a focus on stemming white emigration and rebuilding the economy (all three territories had slipped into recession {{with the end of the}} federation).|$|E

5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>break,</b> the {{division}} was allocated to a {{sector of the}} Margarethe Line, a series of fixed defensive works south of Lake Balaton which held up the Soviet advance. After several Red Army assaults were repulsed, static trench warfare developed between December 1944 and January 1945. In early March 1945, a few units took part in Operation Frühlingserwachen (Spring Awakening), {{which was to be}} Germany's last major offensive. Meanwhile, from December 1944 to March 1945, the rest of {{the division}} remained at Barcs rebuilding. In February, they had been joined by the divisional pioneer battalion, which had finally managed to withdraw from Bosnia. On 16 March, the Soviets launched the Vienna Offensive, bypassing the Barcs area. That night, the division attacked the flanks of the Soviet drive at Heresznye, where it undertook its last offensive operation of the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{witnesses}} took {{ten hours}} to testify, {{during which time}} the court sat continuously. After <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>break,</b> the judge began his summing up, taking two hours to charge the jury. The judge urged the jury to put their prejudice at hearing that Thornton had sex with Ashford out of their heads; they were here to determine if Thornton was guilty of the offence charged. He pointed out to the jury the lack of concealment exhibited by Thornton, his admission of the sexual act and of being with Ashford until 4a.m. The judge told them {{it was not possible}} for Thornton to have committed the acts alleged by the prosecution and still have made it to the Holden farm {{by the time he was}} seen by Heydon, and stressed that Thornton did not act like a man who ran. The judge concluded by reminding the jury that it was better a murderer go free than an innocent man be convicted.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Simpson trained {{throughout}} his winter break into 1957. In May, he rode {{in the national}} 25-mile championships; although he was the favourite, he lost to Sheil in the final. In a points race at an international event at Fallowfield a week later Simpson crashed badly, almost breaking his leg; he stopped working {{for a month and}} struggled to regain his form. At the national pursuit championships, he was beaten in the quarter-finals. After this defeat Simpson returned to road racing, winning the BLRC national hill climb championship in October before taking <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>break</b> from racing. In spring 1958 he traveled to Sofia with Sheil for two weeks' racing. On his return he won the national individual pursuit championship at Herne Hill Velodrome. In July, Simpson won a silver medal for England in the individual pursuit at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, losing to Sheil by one-hundredth of a second in the final. A medical exam taken with the Royal Air Force (RAF) revealed Simpson to be colour blind.|$|E

5|$|Football {{games last}} {{for a total of}} 60 minutes in {{professional}} and college play and are divided into two-halves of 30 minutes and four-quarters of 15 minutes. High school football games are 48 minutes in length with two-halves of 24 minutes and four-quarters of 12 minutes. The two-halves are separated by a halftime period, and the first and third quarters are also followed by <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>break.</b> Prior {{to the start of the}} game, the referee and team captains for each team meet at midfield for a coin toss. The visiting team is allowed to call 'heads' or 'tails'; the winner of the toss is allowed to decide between choosing whether to receive or kick off the ball or choosing which goal they want to defend, but they can also defer their choice until the second half. The losing team, unless the winning team decides to defer, is allowed to choose the option the winning team did not select, and receives the option to receive, kick, or select a goal to defend to begin the second half. Most teams choose to receive or defer, because choosing to kick the ball to start the game would allow the other team to choose which goal to defend. Teams switch goals following the first and third quarters. If a down is in progress when a quarter ends, play continues until the down is completed.|$|E

40|$|Geological {{prospection}} of partly accessible constructional pit for the {{hydroelectric power}} plant (HPP) Brežice was performed. Paleontological content and sediment-petrographic characteristics of rocks were investigated. Neogene part of the succession consists of carbonate silt and siltstone with intercalations of carbonate and silicate sandstone, and polymict sandstone to conglomerate. Based on foraminifera, ostracods, molluscs and marine mammals, the Upper Badenian and Lower Sarmatian age of beds and boundary between them have been determined. The transition is characterized by <b>a</b> <b>shorter</b> <b>break</b> in sedimentation and environmental change. Fossil fids indicate that salinity and depth of sedimentary basin were oscilating in Sarmatian, but in general decreasing. Quaternary cover beds consist of gravelly, sandy and silty deposits of the Sava River...|$|R
50|$|Unwana City {{is located}} in the {{equatorial}} climate belt of Nigeria. It has high temperature of between 27' and 38' with low annual range of temperature.

40|$|The role of {{abscisic acid}} (ABA) in seed {{germination}} of two cultivars of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.; light-sensitive Ritsa and light-insensitive Strada) was investigated. The inhibition of Ritsa seed germination by exogenous ABA {{was higher than}} that of Strada seeds, the extent of inhibition of both cultivars being reduced by <b>a</b> <b>short</b> light <b>break.</b> At 25 °C the sensitivity of both cultivars to exogenous ABA was higher than at 15 °C. The endogenous level of ABA was similar in dry seeds of both cultivars, increasing temporarily in Ritsa seeds during the first 4 h of imbibition in darkness but not in Strada seeds, nor in Ritsa seeds exposed to <b>a</b> <b>short</b> light <b>break.</b> The transitory increase of ABA content in Ritsa seeds imbibed in darkness was accompanied by increased expression of the gene responsive to ABA (Rab) under these conditions. Zorial (Norflurazone), an ABA-biosynthesis inhibitor, decreased ABA content and allowed dark germination of the light-requiring Ritsa seeds. <b>A</b> <b>short</b> light <b>break</b> induced germination of Ritsa seeds when applied at 24 and 48 h after imbibition onset, i. e. after the transitory increase of ABA. GA 3, on the other hand was effective when applied at the beginning of imbibition. It seems that light induces germination of the photoblastic Ritsa seeds by both inhibiting ABA synthesis and decreasing seed sensitivity to ABA and inhibitory processes induced by it...|$|R
