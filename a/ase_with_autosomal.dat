40|$|Autosomal {{recessive}} Stargardt {{disease is}} caused by mutations in the ABCA 4 gene. Mutations in ABCA 4 are also found in two-thirds of cases <b>with</b> <b>autosomal</b> recessive cone-rod dystrophy, and {{a small fraction of}} patients <b>with</b> <b>autosomal</b> recessive retinitis pigmentosa. Patients <b>with</b> <b>autosomal</b> recessive retinitis pigmentosa, the most severe of these three phenotypes, invariably carry ABCA 4 inactivating mutations; patients <b>with</b> <b>autosomal</b> recessive cone-rod dystrophy and Stargardt disease carry combinations of mutations that do not completely inactivate the retina specific 'ATP-binding cassette transporter' (ABCR) protein. DNA diagnostics is complicated by the high allelic heterogeneity and the uncertainty as to whether some ABCA 4 variants are pathological. Nevertheless, ABCA 4 mutation analysis is particularly important for patients with cone-rod dystrophy to confirm the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance...|$|R

40|$|Background and {{objectives}} Plasma copeptin, {{a marker of}} arginine vasopressin, is elevated in patients <b>with</b> <b>autosomal</b> dominant polycystic kidney disease and predicts disease progression. It is unknown whether elevated copeptin levels result from decreased kidney clearance or as compensation for impaired concentrating capacity. Data from patients <b>with</b> <b>autosomal</b> dominant polycystic kidney disease and healthy kidney donors before and after donation were used, because after donation, overall GFR decreases with a functionally normal kidney. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Data were obtained between October of 2008 and January of 2012 from healthy kidney donors who visited the institution for routine measurements predonation and postdonation and patients <b>with</b> <b>autosomal</b> dominant polycystic kidney disease who visited the institution for kidney function measurement. Plasma copeptin levels were measured using a sandwich immunoassay, GFR was measured as I- 125 -iothalamate clearance, and urine concentrating capacity was measured as urine-to-plasma ratio of urea. In patients <b>with</b> <b>autosomal</b> dominant polycystic kidney disease, total kidney volume was measured with magnetic resonance imaging. Results Patients <b>with</b> <b>autosomal</b> dominant polycystic kidney disease (n= 122, age= 40 years, men= 56 %) had significantly higher copeptin levels (median= 6. 8 pmol/L; interquartile range= 3. 4 - 15. 7 pmol/L) compared with donors (n= 134, age= 52 years, men= 49 %) both predonation and postdonation (median= 3. 8 pmol/L; interquartile range= 2. 8 - 6. 3 pmol/L; P Conclusions On {{the basis of the}} finding in donors that kidney clearance is not a main determinant of plasma copeptin levels, it was hypothesized that, in patients <b>with</b> <b>autosomal</b> dominant polycystic kidney disease, kidney damage and associated impaired urine concentration capacity determine copeptin levels...|$|R

40|$|A new {{neural network}} {{approach}} is described {{for the task}} of pole-balancing, considered a benchmark learning control problem. This approach combines Barto, Sutton, and Anderson's [1] Associative Search Element (<b>ASE)</b> <b>with</b> a Neuro-Resistive Grid (NRG) [2] acting as Adaptive Critic Element (ACE). The novel feature in NRG is that it provides evaluation of a state based on propagation of the failure information to the neighbours in the grid. NRG is updated only on a failure and provides <b>ASE</b> <b>with</b> a continuous internal reinforcement signal by comparing {{the value of the}} present state to the previous state. The resulting system learns more rapidly and with fewer computations than that of Barto et al [1]. To establish a uniform basis of comparison of algorithms for pole balancing, both the systems are simulated using benchmark parameters and tests specified in [3].
