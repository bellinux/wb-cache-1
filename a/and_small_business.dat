5|$|A {{third major}} {{criticism}} of the Act {{is that it was}} poorly administered. The Act purposefully brought together competing interests (labor and business, big business <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>business,</b> etc.) in a coalition to support passage of the legislation, but these competing interests soon fought one another over the Act's implementation. As a consequence, NRA collapsed due to failure of leadership and confusion about its goals. By the end of 1934, NRA leaders had practically abandoned the progressive interventionist policy which motivated the Act's passage, and were supporting free-market philosophies—contributing to the collapse of almost all industry codes.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the Western Australia state government allocated relief funds to offset the cost of recovery and clean-up in several of the affected towns. Individuals and families became eligible to apply for personal grants <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>business</b> owners would be considered for special interest rates on new loans. Local government entities listed under the proclamation were the shires of Ashburton, Broome, East Pilbara, Meekatharra, and the Town of Port Hedland. Disaster assistance money in these jurisdictions would be used to restore public assets and infrastructure impaired by the storm.

5|$|Paul was {{assigned}} {{to be on the}} Energy and Natural Resources, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Homeland Security and Government Affairs, <b>and</b> <b>Small</b> <b>Business</b> committees. Paul also formed the Senate Tea Party Caucus with Jim DeMint and Mike Lee as its inaugural members. His first legislative proposal was to cut $500billion from federal spending in one year. This proposal included cutting the Department of Education by 83percent and the United States Department of Homeland Security by 43percent, as well as folding the Department of Energy into the Department of Defense and eliminating the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Seven independent agencies would be eliminated and food stamps would be cut by 30percent. Under Paul's proposal, defense spending would be reduced by 6.5percent and international aid would be eliminated. He later proposed a five-year budget plan intended to balance the budget.|$|E
5|$|At Langport, the Great Bow Bridge, {{which now}} carries the A378, is a three-arched bridge, {{constructed}} {{under the terms}} of the Parrett Navigation Act of 1836. Completed in 1841 at a cost of £3,749, it replaced the previous medieval bridge, with its nine tiny arches, all too small to allow navigation. A bridge at this site was first mentioned in 1220. The medieval bridge consisted of a total of 31 arches, of which nine crossed the river, and 19 of the original arches were located by ground-penetrating radar in 1987, buried beneath the road which runs from Great Bow Bridge to Little Bow Bridge. The Warehouse in Langport was built in the late 18th century of English bond red brick, with Flemish bond extensions. It has clay plain tile roofs with hipped ends. It was built by the Parrett Navigation Company, a trading company owned by Vincent Stuckey and Walter Bagehot, on the banks of the River. When the river became unnavigable, the building was no longer needed, and it was eventually abandoned. The Somerset Trust for Sustainable Development, which became the Ecos Trust, purchased the site, designated as a brown field site, in February 2003, and worked with Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust, English Heritage and local councils to redevelop it into a craft, heritage learning <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>business</b> centre, with the surrounding land being used for an eco-friendly housing development. It is a grade II listed building.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to {{evaluate}} the role that entrepreneurs <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> play in economic development.  How important are entrepreneurs <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> in creating jobs, and are these the types of jobs that should be encouraged?  How important are entrepreneurs <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> {{in the development of}} new products and new markets? Does promoting entrepreneurship <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> make sense as an economic development strategy?  The answer is yes, but with some qualifications.   <b>Small</b> <b>businesses</b> are potent job creators, but so are large businesses.   The attribution of the bulk of net job creation to <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> arises largely from relatively large job losses in large firms, not to especially robust job creation by small firms.   More importantly, data show that large businesses offer better jobs than <b>small</b> <b>businesses,</b> on average, in terms of both compensation and stability.   Further, there is little convincing evidence to suggest that <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> have an edge over larger businesses in innovation.   However, research and experience show that pursuing large businesses {{is likely to be a}} poor economic development strategy, which suggests that promoting entrepreneurship <b>and</b> fostering <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> may offer a more viable alternative.   But more research is needed to evaluate the case, and indeed, to determine whether or not public engagement in economic development itself is a cost-effective <b>and</b> worthwhile pursuit. <b>Small</b> business; Economic development...|$|R
