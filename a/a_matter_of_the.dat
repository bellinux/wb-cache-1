25|$|Scrapple is {{typically}} made of hog offal, {{such as the}} head, heart, liver, and other trimmings, which are boiled with any bones attached (often the entire head), to make a broth. Once cooked, bones and fat are removed, the meat is reserved, and (dry) cornmeal is boiled in the broth to make a mush. The meat, finely minced, is returned to the pot and seasonings, typically sage, thyme, savory, black pepper, and others are added. The mush is formed into loaves and allowed to cool thoroughly until set. The proportions and seasoning are very much <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region and the cook's taste.|$|E
25|$|Trap setters – {{are used}} to set pots or traps for {{catching}} fish, crabs, lobsters, crayfish and other similar species. Trap setters {{range in size from}} open boats operating inshore to larger decked vessels, 20 to 50 metres long, operating out {{to the edge of the}} continental shelf. Small decked trap setters have the wheelhouse either forward or aft with the fish hold amidships. They use hydraulic or mechanical pot haulers. Larger vessels have the wheelhouse forward, and are equipped with derricks, davits or cranes for hauling pots aboard. Locating fish is often more <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fishermen's knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than the use of special detection equipment. Decked vessels are usually equipped with an echosounder, and large vessels may also have a Loran or GPS.|$|E

25|$|Gillnetters – On {{inland waters}} and inshore, {{gillnets}} can be operated from open boats and canoes. In coastal waters, they are operated by small decked vessels which {{can have their}} wheelhouse either aft or forward. In coastal waters, gillnetting is often used as a second fishing method by trawlers or beam trawlers, depending on fishing seasons and targeted species. For offshore fishing, or fishing on the high seas, medium-sized vessels using drifting gillnets are called drifters, and the bridge is usually located aft. The nets are set and hauled by hand on small open boats. Larger boats use hydraulic or occasionally mechanical net haulers, or net drums. These vessels can be equipped with an echosounder, although locating fish is more <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fishermen's personal knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than depending on special detection equipment.|$|E
25|$|The {{classification}} {{of all the}} species and genera of the Rhinoceros family {{below the level of}} Rhinoceratidae has changed more rapidly {{in the first decade of}} the 21st century due to first the continued discovery of fossils representing new species and genera from China and Mongolia and second the number of points of morphology to be compared in computerised phylogenetic analysis. Two branches are generally recognised, that leading to the smaller Rhinoceroses and the Pliocene/Pleistocene branch of the larger elasmotheres. Both began from small species in the steppes of the Far East, but those in turn are comparable to North American species. Whether the branch point is considered to be at the subfamily level (Elasmotheriinae versus Rhinocerotinae) or at the tribe level (Elasmotheriini versus Rhinocerotini, the currently accepted version) or whether the elasmotheres existed at the subtribe level (Elasmotheriina, a discontinued taxon) is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> status quo in publications, fossils and software programs.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} European standards, {{compliance}} by the member {{countries of the}} European Union is purely voluntary, and to be determined {{at the level of}} the member country, usually by means of legislation, or by its own standards organization. To illustrate, this standard, which has been accepted by the United Kingdom, is known locally as BS EN 1789:2007, with the 'BS' referring to British Standards. As a result, the adoption of this standard has varied considerably from one country to another. Most countries, for example, have adopted the sections dealing with vehicle design and performance, while only a few (the UK, Ireland, and Sweden at this writing), have fully adopted the colour, warning system, and livery schemes for such vehicles. To further complicate matters, some countries have adopted some portion of the visual identity standards, but not all. In the Netherlands, Belgium, and some parts of Germany, the conversion to the basic identifying colour (yellow) is occurring, but the balance of visual identity provisions are not. In addition, some countries which are not currently members of the European Union, such as Norway are adopting some portions of the standards, primarily because few other good standards exist for this purpose, particularly those that reflect European realities. The rate and degree of compliance with the standard is a conscious choice by individual countries, while in others, compliance is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> priorities for the changing of older, country specific, legislation. As previously stated, compliance with the standard is purely voluntary. There are no untoward financial implications to compliance, since only ambulances purchased after ratification of the standard by each country are required to be compliant. There is no mandatory provision for the retrofitting of existing ambulances.|$|E

500|$|Some {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that a learned ability to interpret blurred images may account for perceived improvements in eyesight. Ophthalmologist Walter B.

[...] Lancaster faulted ophthalmologists in general for neglecting the role of the brain in the process of seeing, [...] "leaving to irregular, half-trained workers the cultivation of that field".|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} work as [...] "entertaining, {{thoughtful}} and eminently readable", although some thought it was too mournful in places. Separating Shelley's travel memoir from the new guidebooks and handbooks, reviews such as that from the Atlas, praised her [...] "rich fancy, her intense love of nature, and her sensitive apprehension {{of all that is}} good, and beautiful and free". They praised its independence of thought, wit, and feeling. Shelley's commentary on the social and political life of Italy, which was generally thought superior to the German sections, caused one reviewer to call the book the work of [...] "a woman who thinks for herself on all subjects, and who dares to say what she thinks", a woman with a [...] "masculine and original mind". Not all reviewers celebrated her independence of mind. The Observer wrote: [...] "With her, as with all women, politics is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart, and not as with the more robust nature of man, of the head... It is an idle and unprofitable theme for a woman." [...] Most of the reviews responded positively to Shelley's political aims; those that were unsympathetic to her political position generally disputed her specific claims. For example, one reviewer claimed that Italy had been improved by Austrian rule.|$|E
500|$|Terry Farrell {{was happy}} with the story line, saying that it made sense for Dax to have this issue because the {{symbiont}} had been in {{both male and female}} hosts, adding that [...] "Gender wasn't the issue.

A similar story had been approached during the first appearance of the Trill in The Next Generation episode [...] "". In this story, however, when the symbiont is transferred from a male to a female host, the Trill is rejected by the character who was the Trill's female partner, Beverly Crusher. The subplot featuring Kahn's artificial wormhole was described as a [...] "macguffin" [...] by Moore, and simply a way to get the character into [...] "Rejoined". This was not the first subplot to be considered for the episode, with the main plot from [...] "" [...] originally thought of as being suitable to appear in either [...] "Rejoined" [...] or [...] "". Instead, the plot, which involved Rom forming a trade union, was expanded into the main plot of its own episode.|$|E
