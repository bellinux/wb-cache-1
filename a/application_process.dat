Of those tickets, approximately 21,000 were reserved for each finalist club, with a further 10,500 available for purchase {{by the general public}} via the UEFA website. Recipients of those tickets were determined by a random ballot following an online <b>application</b> <b>process</b> that ran from 28 February to 19 March 2008. Tickets were available in three categories, priced at €80, €140 and €200 depending on their location in the stadium.

40|$|LiPS 1 is {{a system}} for {{distributed}} computing using idle-cycles in heterogeneous networks of workstations. Especially data- and compute-intensive applications {{in the field of}} cryptography and computer algebra have used the system. The system provides its user with the tuple space based generative communication paradigm of parallel computing as known from the coordination language Linda 2. In LiPS, failures (fail stop failures) like crashed machines are handled transparently for the application. Dynamic Load Adaption, meaning removing <b>application</b> <b>processes</b> from machines not being idle any longer and migrating those processes to idle machines is based on the detection of crashed <b>application</b> <b>processes</b> and the (re) start of <b>application</b> <b>processes</b> on an idle machine.

For a size-k cache shared by P <b>application</b> <b>processes</b> that always make good cache replacement decisions, we develop an online application-controlled paging algorithm with a competitive ratio of 2 H P Γ 1 + 2. Typically, P is much smaller than k, perhaps by several orders of magnitude. Our competitive ratio improves upon the 2 P + 2 competitive ratio achieved by [CFL 94 a].

In preparation for the enrollment period, Burwell hired additional staff to coordinate operations. The first open-enrollment period, which had occurred during Secretary Sebelius' tenure, was marred by technical difficulties with the Healthcare.gov website. In preparation for the second enrollment period, the HealthCare.gov website underwent various testing actions.

5|$|The {{requirements}} for admission differ between students from Ontario, other provinces in Canada, and international students {{due to the lack}} of uniformity in marking schemes. In 2016, 44 percent of applications to full-time, first-year studies were accepted. In 2013, the secondary school average for full-time first-year students at Queen's was 89% overall, with the Commerce, Education and Engineering faculties having the highest entrance averages at 91.7%, 90.8%, and 90.6% respectively. The <b>application</b> <b>process</b> emphasizes the mandatory Personal Statement of Experience (PSE). The statement expresses how the applicant's personal experiences may contribute to the university. It focuses on qualifications and involvement outside of academics and is an important factor in determining admission. Several faculties require applicants to submit a supplementary essay.|$|E

On September 14, the IOC recognized seven cities—Baku, Chicago, Doha, Madrid, Prague, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo—which had been put forward by their respective NOCs to bid. On October 1, 2007, the Rio de Janeiro bid committee paid the required fee of USD 150,000 to the IOC and signed the Candidature Acceptance Procedure. Soon after, from October 15 to 19, Rio officials attended the 2016 Applicant cities' Seminar organized by the IOC at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, where they learnt more about technical areas that would be analyzed throughout the <b>application</b> <b>process.</b> On January 14, 2008, the seven Applicant cities returned documents, known as the Application Files, containing the answers and guarantees requested by the 2016 Candidature Acceptance Procedure, which provided to the IOC an overview of each city's project. The responses were studied by the IOC Working Group for months and served as the basis to the shortlist of Chicago, Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro and Madrid on June 4, 2008, becoming Candidate cities during a meeting of the IOC Executive Board at the 2008 SportAccord Convention in Athens, Greece.|$|E
