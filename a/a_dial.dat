5|$|A {{clock is}} {{documented}} in this tower since 1405, {{when a new}} bell was installed. The city accounts of 1438 mention the repair of the clockworks. The first mention of <b>a</b> <b>dial</b> is in 1443, and the first known image of the, much smaller first astrolabium dial (in the diary a cobbler journeyman from Ulm) is dated 1534. The jacquemart (bellstriker) is also documented in the same 1534 source.|$|E
5|$|At Vauxhall, Sir Samuel Morland built a fine room, anno 1667, {{the inside}} all of looking-glass, and fountains very {{pleasant}} to behold, {{which is much}} visited by strangers: it {{stands in the middle}} of the garden, covered with Cornish slate, on the point of which he placed a punchinello, very well carved, which held <b>a</b> <b>dial,</b> but the winds have demolished it.|$|E
5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years immediately preceding World War I {{and the development of}} the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided gun data to the turrets via a pointer on <b>a</b> <b>dial,</b> which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. Lion received her system in early 1915 while undergoing repairs after the Battle of Dogger Bank and Princess Royal got hers in early 1916. A second director was added to each ship in 1918.|$|E

5|$|Neptune was {{the first}} British {{dreadnought}} to be built with a gunnery director, albeit an experimental prototype designed by Vice-Admiral Sir Percy Scott. This was mounted on the foremast, underneath the spotting top and electrically provided data to the turrets via pointer on <b>a</b> <b>dial,</b> which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised {{the effects of the}} roll on the dispersion of the shells. The ship's director was later replaced as a new one was ordered in 1913 and installed by May 1916.|$|E
5|$|Another set of officials, {{the chain}} crew, are {{responsible}} for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people – {{two members of the}} chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with <b>a</b> <b>dial</b> on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down, and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.|$|E
5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years between the St Vincents' commissioning {{and the start of}} World War I and the most important development was the director firing system. Mounted high in the ship, a fire-control director electrically provided data to the turrets via a pointer on <b>a</b> <b>dial,</b> which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. While the exact dates of installation are unknown, St Vincent was equipped with a director by December 1915 and the others by May 1916. The ships were fitted with Mark I Dreyer Fire-control Tables in the transmission stations by early 1916, which combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock.|$|E

5|$|Magnavox {{designed}} {{the exterior of}} the machine, and re-engineered some the internals with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from <b>a</b> <b>dial</b> to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of the machine prior to the planned production start date. Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, {{to go along with the}} plastic overlays for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.|$|E

25|$|Automatic exchanges, or dial service, {{came into}} {{existence}} in the early 20th century. Their purpose was to {{eliminate the need for}} human switchboard operators who completed the connections required for a telephone call. Automation replaced human operators with electromechanical systems and telephones were equipped with <b>a</b> <b>dial</b> by which a caller transmitted the destination telephone number to the automatic switching system.|$|E
25|$|In 1840 Wheatstone had {{patented}} an alphabetical telegraph, or, 'Wheatstone A B C instrument,' which {{moved with}} a step-by-step motion, {{and showed the}} letters of the message upon <b>a</b> <b>dial.</b> The same principle was used in his type-printing telegraph, patented in 1841. This was the first apparatus which printed a telegram in type. It was worked by two circuits, and as the type revolved a hammer, actuated by the current, pressed the required letter on the paper.|$|E

50|$|The Carrera chronograph, {{designed}} by Jack Heuer, {{was introduced in}} 1963. The Carrera had a very simple design, with only the registers and applied markers on the dial. The fixed inner bezel is divided into 1/5 second increments. The 1960s Carreras were available with <b>a</b> variety of <b>dials,</b> including all-white, all-black, white registers on <b>a</b> black <b>dial,</b> and black registers on <b>a</b> black <b>dial.</b> <b>A</b> three-register, triple calendar version of the Carrera was introduced around 1968.|$|R

25|$|More {{accurate}} {{methods for}} determining the preload rely on defining or measuring the screw extension from the nut. Alternatively, measurement of the angular rotation of the nut can {{serve as the basis}} for defining screw extension based on the fastener's thread pitch. Measuring the screw extension directly allows the clamping force to be very accurately calculated. This can be achieved using <b>a</b> <b>dial</b> test indicator, reading deflection at the fastener tail, using a strain gauge, or ultrasonic length measurement.|$|E
25|$|When a {{subscriber}} {{dialed the}} number of a manual station, an operator at the destination office answered the call after seeing the number on an indicator, and connected the call by plugging a cord into the outgoing circuit and ringing the destination station. For example, if <b>a</b> <b>dial</b> customer calling from TAylor 4725 dialed a number served by a manual exchange, e.g., ADams 1383-W, the call was completed, from the subscriber’s perspective, exactly as a call to LEnnox 5813, in an automated exchange. The party line letters W, R, J, and M were only used in manual exchanges with jack-per-line party lines.|$|E
25|$|The first Panel-type exchanges {{were placed}} in service in Newark, New Jersey, on January 16, 1915 at the Mulberry central office, and on June 12 in the Waverly central office. These system were semi-mechanical systems using {{telephones}} at customer stations without <b>a</b> <b>dial.</b> Operators answered calls and keyed the station number into the panel switch. The first fully machine-switching Panel systems using common control principles {{were placed in}} service in Omaha, Nebraska in December 1921, followed by the PEnnsylvania exchange in New York City in October 1922. Most Panel installations were replaced by modern systems during the 1970s and the last Panel switch was decommissioned in the Bigelow central office in Newark by 1983.|$|E

The NAD {{is often referred to}} as <b>a</b> <b>dialler,</b> predictive dialler or least cost routing dialler.|$|R
25|$|The biggest {{achievement}} of the invention of clepsydrae during this time, however, was by Ctesibius with his incorporation of gears and <b>a</b> <b>dial</b> indicator to automatically show the time as the lengths of the days changed throughout the year, because of the temporal timekeeping used during his day. Also, a Greek astronomer, Andronicus of Cyrrhus, supervised the construction of his Horologion, known today as the Tower of the Winds, in the Athens marketplace (or agora) {{in the first half}} of the 1st century BCE. This octagonal clocktower showed scholars and shoppers both sundials and mechanical hour indicators. It featured a 24-hour mechanized clepsydra and indicators for the eight winds from which the tower got its name, and it displayed the seasons of the year and astrological dates and periods.|$|E
25|$|At McCook Field in 1923, Hegenberger (who {{had also}} become a Robins protégé) worked closely with {{engineer}} Bradley Jones, a leading authority on air navigation, to test and adapt for military purposes an earth inductor compass developed by the Pioneer Instrument Company {{in conjunction with the}} National Bureau of Standards. Hegenberger designed an instrument panel incorporating the earth inductor compass, a driftmeter, and a magnetic compass for a navigation station at which sextant readings could also be taken; and a cockpit panel with <b>a</b> <b>dial</b> connected to the navigation station that indicated to the pilot if he was steering to the right or left of the course set by the inductor compass. On September 6, 1923, Hegenberger and Jones successfully tested the equipment by navigating from Dayton to Boston, Massachusetts in a DH-4, above unbroken clouds that completely prevented them from seeing any landmarks on the ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{first player}} moves {{the number of}} spaces along the track {{according}} to <b>a</b> <b>dial</b> spin. If the player lands on a pink star, his turn ends. If he lands on a yellow star, he draws a card and follows its instruction. If he draws a picture card, he retains it face down at his place. If a player spins a six, he is given the choice of moving six spaces or taking a magic wand. He may play the wand {{at any time during}} the game and in doing so draws two cards, following their instructions. A player must hold three different picture cards before entering the Path of Happiness. If he does not hold three picture cards, he continues around the Deep Sleep circle until he acquires the required three picture cards. Should a player land on a purple Maleficent space, that player returns one of his picture cards to the deck.|$|E
