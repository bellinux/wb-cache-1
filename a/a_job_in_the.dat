He played cricket as often as he could in the summer; when unable to play for Middlesex, he played weekend club cricket—including for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)—and country house cricket.|$|E
5|$|Most {{schools were}} {{residential}} whereby {{both teachers and}} students resided as a rule. The teachers appointed were jurists, theologians, and traditionalists who received their salary from endowments to the institutions they taught in. Each student was offered a lodging where he would resort, a teacher to instruct him in whatever art he requested, and regular grants to cover all his needs. Madrasas were considered prestigious institutions in society. Under the Ayyubids, {{it was not possible}} to obtain <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> government without receiving an education from a madrasa.|$|E

Reggie arrived {{during the summer of}} 1945, and found <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Features Department of the BBC. He was {{identified}} as a Communist spy by MI5 in 1947, and placed under surveillance. According to his file, Reggie had been working to increase Soviet influence in Romania and the Middle East throughout the war. Manning did not share her husband's political beliefs, but was quite aware that their phone was being tapped and feared that his open support for Communism would lead to him being sacked from the BBC. Reggie was soon transferred away from Features to the less politically sensitive Drama department. The surveillance stopped when he resigned from the Communist Party after the Russian invasion of Hungary in 1956.|$|E
5|$|By early 1944 Treloar was overworked {{and unhappy}} {{to be in}} Melbourne instead of at the Memorial. He was also uncomfortable with {{the way in which}} Bean and the AWM's acting {{director}} Arthur Bazley were running the Memorial in his absence, and sought to intervene in its management. This degree of intervention frustrated Bazley, and led to increasing conflict between the two men who had worked together since 1917. Their relationship worsened in 1945, and the Memorial's board was eventually forced to make a ruling on what Bazley and Treloar's responsibilities were. In 1946, Bazley left the Memorial to take <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Department of Immigration due to continuing tensions with Treloar.|$|E

Meanwhile, Hayes returns to his apartment complex where walls are covered with crime scene photos related to the death of Luke Doggett. Eventually, Doggett asks Hayes for help solving the case about his son's death.

Orr's father, Doug Orr, had once been a hockey {{prospect}} and was invited to join the Atlantic City Seagulls in 1942 but turned down the offer. Doug Orr instead joined the Royal Canadian Navy, serving during the Second World War. He returned after the war to Parry Sound and Arva Steele, whom he had married before he left for war, and to <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CIL dynamite factory. Doug and Arva had five children together: Patricia, Ronnie, Bobby, Penny and Doug Jr. Bobby was born on March 20, 1948 at St. Joseph's Hospital, where his grandmother Elsie Orr was a nurse.

5|$|Parseghian, who was 51 at the time, said {{he planned}} to take at least a year off from {{coaching}} before considering a run at <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> professional ranks. Rumors circulated throughout 1975 that he might return to Notre Dame, but both he and Devine denied them. He finally decided that December that he would not coach in 1976 despite reportedly being pursued by the New York Jets of the NFL, but would instead host a television show beginning the following fall. His last coaching appearance was with the college players in the annual Chicago College All-Star Game against the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers on July 23, 1976 at Chicago's Soldier Field. The game was halted in the second half when a torrential thunderstorm broke out. Fans rushed onto the field, and play was never resumed. It was the last such game ever played.|$|E

5|$|After his {{graduation}} Hayden {{moved to}} Detroit {{to work for}} Dodge but returned to Kentucky after the first summer because of homesickness. During the 1922-23 basketball season he coached at Kentucky Wesleyan College which was in Winchester at the time. In his one season at Kentucky Wesleyan he went 8-1. He then taught and coached at George Rogers Clark High School while taking <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> insurance business in Richmond, Kentucky. In 1926 he was called to replace Ray Eklund as the head basketball coach at the University of Kentucky but was given only one week {{to prepare for the}} task with a team made up of unskilled members. The squad consisted primarily of football players, many of whom lacked the incentive to fully participate. The team finished with a 3–13 record, winning once against the University of Florida and twice against Centre College. When Harry Gamage was named the new head coach of the university's football squad, he had Hayden replaced with John Mauer. The team would not have another losing season until 1988–89 under Eddie Sutton.|$|E
5|$|After the 2004 season, four Trojan {{assistant}} coaches were offered and took jobs elsewhere.

Also leaving, were defensive line coach Ed Orgeron, who took the head coaching position at Ole Miss, quarterbacks coach Carl Smith, who became the offensive coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars, and offensive line coach Tim Davis who {{was hired by the}} Miami Dolphins. Carroll rebuilt his staff by elevating Ken Norton, Jr. from graduate assistant to full-time assistant coaching the linebackers, and hiring Steve Sarkisian, who was with the Oakland Raiders in 2004 and was formerly with the Trojans, as quarterbacks coach. Pat Ruel, who was with the New York Giants in 2004, to coach the offensive line, and Jethro Franklin, who spent 2004 with the Green Bay Packers, as defensive line coach, Sarkisian would additionally be named as assistant head coach and Lane Kiffin, wide receivers coach, would add recruiting and offensive coordinating to his duties.|$|E

Angie becomes concerned {{on whether or not}} their family will be taken care of after Tracy dies. Jack offers Angie <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entertainment business, and takes the opportunity to get even with Liz by assigning Angie as Liz's intern. Liz realizes that Angie's new job is Jack's way of messing with her, and explains to Angie that as her intern she is not getting paid and fires her. Angie gets upset with Jack and Liz but Jack offers her a reality show during TGSs time slot unless Liz signs the divorce papers. Liz, however, still refuses—even admitting she likes the concept of a reality show starring Angie and would watch it. To get back at Jack, Liz holds a press conference and announces that she and Jack have decided to donate $5million to The Jack and Elizabeth Donaghy High School for Teen Drama, The Arts, and Feelings. The next day, Jack and Liz have a sit down meeting with NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane) to discuss their marriage as NBC has strict anti-nepotism guidelines. During the meeting, the two realize that they have had the longest and most meaningful relationship either of them has ever had, and apologize to each other with Liz agreeing to sign the divorce papers and Jack promising to restore TGSs budget.|$|E
