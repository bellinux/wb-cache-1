5|$|<b>Annealing</b> is {{the process}} of heating the steel to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature to relieve local internal stresses. It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material. <b>Annealing</b> goes through three phases: recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth. The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends on the type of <b>annealing</b> to be achieved and the alloying constituents.|$|E
5|$|<b>Annealing</b> {{involves}} the heating {{of a piece}} of steel to 700–800°C for several hours and then gradual cooling. It makes the steel softer and more workable.|$|E
5|$|Holliday's {{original}} model {{assumed that}} heteroduplex DNA would be present on both chromosomes, but experimental data on yeast refuted this. An updated model by Matt Meselson and Charley Radding in 1975 introduced {{the idea of}} branch migration. Further observations in the 1980s led to the proposal of alternate mechanisms for recombination such as the double-strand break model (by Jack Szostak, Frank Stahl, and others) and the single-strand <b>annealing</b> model. A third, the synthesis-dependent strand <b>annealing</b> model, did not involve Holliday junctions.|$|E
40|$|Deep {{defects in}} <b>annealed</b> InP have been {{investigated}} by deep level transient capacitance spectroscopy (DLTS), photo induced current transient spectroscopy (PICTS) and thermally stimulated current spectroscopy (TSC). Both DLTS results of <b>annealed</b> semiconducting InP and PICTS and TSC results of <b>annealed</b> semi-insulating InP indicate that InP <b>annealed</b> in phosphorus ambient has five defects, while lid? <b>annealed</b> in iron phospbide ambient has two defects. Such a defect formation phenomenon is {{explained in terms of}} defect suppression by the iron atom diffusion process. The correlation of the defects {{and the nature of the}} defects in <b>annealed</b> InP are discussed based on the results...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{demonstration}} of metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors with Eu 2 O 3 dielectric for analog and DRAM applications. The influence of different <b>anneal</b> {{conditions on the}} electrical characteristics of the fabricated MIM capacitors is studied. FG <b>anneal</b> results in high capacitance density (7 fF/mu m(2)), whereas oxygen <b>anneal</b> results in low quadratic voltage coefficient of capacitance (VCC) (194 ppm/V- 2 at 100 kHz), and argon <b>anneal</b> results in low leakage current density (3. 2 x 10 (- 8) A/cm(2) at - 1 V). We correlate these electrical results with the surface chemical states of the films through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. In particular, FG <b>anneal</b> and argon <b>anneal</b> result in sub-oxides, which modulate the electrical properties...|$|R
5|$|Quenching {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, {{which is just a}} specialized type of <b>annealing,</b> to reduce brittleness. In this application the <b>annealing</b> (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} types of heat {{treating}} processes available to steel. The most common are <b>annealing,</b> quenching, and tempering. Heat treatment is effective on compositions above the eutectoid composition (hypereutectoid) of 0.8% carbon. Hypoeutectoid steel does not benefit from heat treatment.|$|E

After the {{aragonite}} {{nacreous layer}} and {{cross section of}} Periglypta Magnifica mollusk shell were <b>annealed,</b> the influences, including crystallization temperatures, crystallization time and concentrations of calcium chloride aqueous solution on the crystal morphology of <b>annealed</b> shell was studied.

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Fig.  6 a, the ED EPR signal is broader in the SiO 2 :C sample <b>annealed</b> at 700  °C than that for the <b>annealed</b> at 800  °C. This can be {{explained}} by the shorter spin-lattice relaxation time for CRD in the SiO 2 :C sample <b>annealed</b> at 700  °C. Different relaxation times indicate that unpaired spins of CRD in SiO 2 :C sample <b>annealed</b> at 700 and 800  °C are in a different structural environment. The longer spin-lattice relaxation time for the CRD observed in SiO 2 :C sample <b>annealed</b> at 800  °C indicates that the local field dynamics in this sample is strongly suppressed.|$|R
5|$|Unlike the nitrate, the oxide {{is similar}} to the {{corresponding}} samarium salt and not the neodymium salt. As-synthesized, e.g. by heating the oxalate, it is a white or lavender-colored powder with disordered structure. This powder crystallizes in a cubic lattice upon heating to 600°C. Further <b>annealing</b> at 800°C and then at 1750°C irreversibly transforms it to a monoclinic and hexagonal phases, respectively, and the last two phases can be interconverted by adjusting the <b>annealing</b> time and temperature.|$|E

5|$|Because of self-irradiation, {{a sample}} of {{plutonium}} fatigues throughout its crystal structure, meaning the ordered arrangement of its atoms becomes disrupted by radiation with time.

40|$|AbstractRoom {{temperature}} ferromagnetism {{was found}} in hydrogenated N-Doped amorphous carbon films (a-CNx:H) prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The magnetization of the films changes depending on N content, deposition temperature and <b>annealed</b> temperature. Compared {{with that of the}} as-deposited sample, the magnetic moment of the <b>annealed</b> sample had a significant decrease. Among the <b>annealed</b> samples, the film <b>annealed</b> at 450 °C possessed the highest magnetization. Higher or lower <b>annealed</b> temperature made the magnetization of the film decrease. Any ferromagnetic impurities didn’t be detected. The ferromagnetism of a-CNx:H film is intrinsic. We believe that N adatoms on the surfaces of the films have localized magnetic moments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Al and Sb codoped ZnO {{thin films}} were {{prepared}} through a sol-gel spin coating method on glass substrates and <b>annealed</b> in different atmospheres.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum shows that the emission peaks of the films are mostly at 390 and 460 nm, and the film <b>annealed</b> in hydrogen has the strongest intensity of peak at 390 nm and the film <b>annealed</b> in air has the strongest intensity of peak at 460 nm.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the initial hydrogen content of a titanium alloy on subsequent resistance to hot salt stress corrosion embrittlement and cracking was investigated. A Ti- 8 Al- 1 Mo- 1 V alloy was tested in four conditions: mill <b>annealed</b> (70 ppm H), duplex <b>annealed</b> (70 ppm H), vacuum <b>annealed</b> to an intermediate (36 ppm H) and a low (9 ppm H) hydrogen level. Material <b>annealed</b> at 650 C (duplex condition) exhibited resistance to hot salt stress corrosion superior to that exhibited by material in the mill <b>annealed</b> condition. Reduction of the alloy hydrogen content from 70 to as low as 9 ppm did not influence resistance to hot salt stress corrosion embrittlement or cracking...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of hydrogen gas <b>anneals</b> on the electrical properties of nominally undoped, oxygen-deficient SrTiO 3 −x single crystals was investigated. Titanium getter layers and vacuum <b>anneals</b> {{were used to}} obtain oxygen-deficient SrTiO 3 −x with a low electrical resistivity. These crystals showed an optical absorption peak at 2. 92 eV and strong midinfrared absorption. Subsequent <b>anneals</b> at 800 °C in forming gas, which contained 10 % hydrogen, returned the crystals into the insulating, transparent state. The mechanisms by which hydrogen <b>anneals</b> can compensate {{for the effects of}} oxygen vacancies in SrTiO 3 −x are discussed.

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{integrated}} transfer operators for positively weighted independent identically distributed smooth expanding systems give rise to <b>annealed</b> equilibrium states for a new variational principle. The unique <b>annealed</b> equilibrium state coincides with the unique <b>annealed</b> Gibbs state. Using work of Ruelle [1990] and Fried [1995] on generalised Fredholm determinants for transfer operators, we prove that the discrete spectrum of the transfer operators coincides with the correlation spectrum of these invariant measures (yielding exponential decay of correlations), and with the poles of an <b>annealed</b> zeta function, defined also for complex weights. A modified integrated transfer operator is introduced, which describes the (relativised) quenched states studied e. g. by Kifer [1992], and conditions (including SRB) ensuring coincidence of quenched and <b>annealed</b> states are given. For small random perturbations we obtain stability results on the quenched and <b>annealed</b> measures and spectra by applying perturbative results of Young and the author [1993]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Tensile {{properties}} of rolled and <b>annealed</b> copper thin foils were investigated {{based on the}} grain size and thickness. Yield strength was higher in the thinner foil than in the thicker foil at as-rolled state. Difference of yield strength between the thinner foil and the thicker foil becomes small at <b>annealed</b> state. Tensile strength was higher in the thinner foil than in the thicker foil at as-rolled state, but it was reversed at <b>annealed</b> state. Strain to fracture or elongation increased with increasing thickness in the <b>annealed</b> state. A knife edge type of fracture was characterized in both the as-rolled state and the <b>annealed</b> state. A higher tensile strength and strain to fracture of the <b>annealed</b> thicker foil was attributed to the higher number of grains per thickness. From this work, {{it was concluded that}} mechanical {{properties of}} thin foils were dependent upon the number of grains per thickness...|$|R
40|$|We study <b>annealed</b> {{theories}} of learning boolean functions using a concept class of finite cardinality. The naive <b>annealed</b> theory {{can be used}} to derive a universal learning curve bound for zero temperature learning, similar to the inverse square root bound from the Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory. Tighter, nonuniversal learning curve bounds are also derived. A more refined <b>annealed</b> theory leads to still tighter bounds, which in some cases are very similar to results previously obtained using one-step replica symmetry breaking. 1. Introduction The <b>annealed</b> approximation 1 has proven to be an invaluable tool for studying the statistical mechanics of learning from examples.

25|$|For {{any given}} finite problem, the {{probability}} that the simulated <b>annealing</b> algorithm terminates with a global optimal solution approaches 1 as the <b>annealing</b> schedule is extended.

25|$|It is {{critical}} to determine a proper temperature for the <b>annealing</b> step because efficiency and specificity are strongly affected by the <b>annealing</b> temperature. This temperature must be low enough to allow for hybridization of the primer to the strand, but high enough for the hybridization to be specific, i.e., the primer should bind only to a perfectly complementary part of the strand, and nowhere else. If the temperature is too low, the primer may bind imperfectly. If it is too high, the primer may not bind at all. A typical <b>annealing</b> temperature is about 3–5°C below the Tm of the primers used. Stable hydrogen bonds between complementary bases are formed only when the primer sequence very closely matches the template sequence. During this step, the polymerase binds to the primer-template hybrid and begins DNA formation.|$|E
