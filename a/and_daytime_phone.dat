2500|$|The release sparked {{controversy}} immediately due to {{the fact}} that Universal removed the credit [...] "Moustapha Akkad Presents" [...] and replaced it with [...] "Universal, An MCA Company, Presents" ... in a font that did not match the rest of the opening credits. Akkad's son, Malek, called the stunt [...] "disgusting. It's a disgrace obviously, bias bjectively, any horror fan would find this as an insult to the man who has done so much to the series. And to come after his tragic death, he's not even around to defend himself. It's classless. I'm talking to Universal now and they're 'looking into it." [...] However, Akkad was still credited on the packaging. Fans immediately called for a boycott of the disc and set up a Facebook page. On November 28, Universal started sending out emails announcing that the revised Blu-ray was now available and for owners of the previous disc to provide the studio with their [...] "address <b>and</b> <b>daytime</b> <b>phone</b> number".|$|E

We contrasted forgetting of {{both kinds of}} materials across a 12 -hour interval involving either nocturnal sleep or daytime wakefulness (experiment 1) and a 2 -hour interval involving either daytime napping or wakefulness (experiment 2). Beneficial effects of post-learning nocturnal sleep <b>and</b> <b>daytime</b> napping were greater for unrelated word pairs (Cohen’s d = 0. 71 and 0. 68) than for related ones (Cohen’s d = 0. 58 and 0. 15). While the size of nocturnal sleep <b>and</b> <b>daytime</b> napping effects was similar for unrelated word pairs, for related pairs, the effect of nocturnal sleep was more prominent. Together, {{these findings suggest that}} sleep preferentially facilitates offline memory processing of materials that are more susceptible to forgetting...|$|R
