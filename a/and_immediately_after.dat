Health of females was more affected by parasites than by rainfall; parasite count in females peaked prior to <b>and</b> <b>immediately</b> <b>after</b> parturition. Studies show that springbok host helminths (Haemonchus, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus), ixodid ticks (Rhipicephalus species), lice (Damalinia and Linognathus species). Eimeria species mainly affect juveniles.|$|E
5|$|Although cavalry {{was used}} {{extensively}} {{throughout the world}} during the 19th century, horses became less important to warfare after {{the beginning of the}} 20th century.

5|$|After the JNA {{completed}} its evacuation of the Zadar garrison, its force {{north of the}} city regrouped and launched a new offensive on 18 November with infantry and armoured units (supported by artillery bombardment and close air support). The attack targeted the villages of Škabrnja, Gorica, Nadin and Zemunik Donji. Škabrnja was captured on the first day after an air assault by a battalion of the JNA 63rd Parachute Brigade, and Nadin fell on 19 November. During <b>and</b> <b>immediately</b> <b>after</b> the attack on Škabrnja, the JNA and the supporting SAO Krajina TO forces killed 39 civilians and 14 ZNG soldiers in {{what became known as the}} Škabrnja massacre. Some of those killed were buried in a mass grave in the village; twenty-seven victims were exhumed in 1995, after the end of the war. Another seven civilians were killed in Nadin.|$|E

The first English Army regiments, including elements of the disbanded New Model Army, were formed between November 1660 and January 1661 and became a standing military force for Britain (financed by Parliament). The Royal Scots and Irish Armies were financed by the parliaments of Scotland and Ireland. Parliamentary control was established by the Bill of Rights 1689 and Claim of Right Act 1689, although the monarch continued to influence aspects of army administration until at least {{the end of the}} nineteenth century.|$|E

5|$|Ernest Brooks (23 February 1876 — 1957) was a British photographer, {{best known}} for his war {{photography}} from the First World War. He was the first official photographer to be appointed by the British military, and produced several thousand images between 1915 and 1918, more than a tenth of all British official photographs taken during the war. His work was often posed and formal, but several of his less conventional images are marked by a distinctive use of silhouette. Before <b>and</b> <b>immediately</b> <b>after</b> the war he worked as an official photographer to the Royal Family, but was dismissed from this appointment and stripped of his official honours in 1925.|$|E
5|$|If the {{agreements}} at Montmirail had been followed up, {{the acts of}} homage could potentially have confirmed Louis's position as king, while undermining the legitimacy of any rebellious barons within Henry's territories {{and the potential for}} an alliance between them and Louis. In practice, however, Louis perceived himself to have gained a temporary advantage, <b>and</b> <b>immediately</b> <b>after</b> the conference he began to encourage tensions between Henry's sons. Meanwhile, Henry's position in the south of France continued to improve, and by 1173 he had agreed to an alliance with Humbert, the Count of Savoy, which betrothed Henry's son John and Humbert's daughter Alicia. Henry's daughter Eleanor was married to Alfonso VIII of Castile in 1170, enlisting an additional ally in the south. In February 1173, Raymond finally gave in and publicly gave homage for Toulouse to Henry and his heirs.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 2 the US Air Force {{delivered}} a 37-minute strike against Hills 518 and 346. The artillery then laid down its concentrations on the hills, and after that the planes came over again with napalm, leaving the heights on fire. Just after 10:00, <b>and</b> <b>immediately</b> <b>after</b> the final napalm strike, the 1st Battalion, US 7th Cavalry, attacked up Hill 518. The heavy air strikes and the artillery preparations had failed to dislodge the North Koreans. From their positions they delivered mortar and machine gun fire on the climbing infantry, stopping the weak, advanced US force short of the crest. In the afternoon the US battalion withdrew from Hill 518 and attacked northeast against Hill 490, from which other North Korean troops had fired {{in support of the}} North Koreans on Hill 518.|$|E
5|$|There are urban legends that persist to {{the present}} {{concerning}} Luna diverting millions of pesos from the Republic's treasury, particularly from Ilocos and Pampanga, to the hometown of his alleged sweetheart, Ysidra Cojuangco. Ysidra was the aunt of Jose Cojuangco, father of Corazon Aquino. Luna's wealth was rumored to have been entrusted to Ysidra, resulting in the latter {{becoming one of the}} richest women in the Philippines by 1900. However, there were no recorded comments or printed insinuations of Luna's financial impropriety from anti-Luna figures of the Aguinaldo government during <b>and</b> <b>immediately</b> <b>after</b> the Philippine–American War.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{had been}} a regular member of the Australian Test team since his debut in 1934, <b>and</b> <b>immediately</b> <b>after</b> World War II, he captained Australia in the inaugural Test against New Zealand. However, he was sidelined by injury in 194647 and Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris opened in the Tests, {{averaging}} 73.83 and 71.85 respectively. Brown resumed his Test career in the following season, replacing Barnes, but he was dropped after scoring 29 runs in two Tests. Barnes then came in and made 139 runs {{in the next two}} Tests, including a 112 in the Fourth Test. Morris was then rested for the Fifth Test to allow Brown another chance to show his ability and make a case for continued national selection, and he made 99. In the Tests against India during the season, Barnes, Morris and Brown had shared the opening duties; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively. In any case, Brown had done enough to tour England with The Invincibles in 1948, his third trip there, although Barnes and Morris were the first-choice opening combination.|$|E

5|$|Cultural {{attitudes towards}} rain differ across the world. In {{temperate}} climates, {{people tend to}} be more stressed when the weather is unstable or cloudy, with its impact greater on men than women. Rain can also bring joy, as some consider it to be soothing or enjoy the aesthetic appeal of it. In dry places, such as India, or during periods of drought, rain lifts people's moods. In Botswana, the Setswana word for rain, pula, is used as the name of the national currency, in recognition of the economic importance of rain in its country, since it has a desert climate. Several cultures have developed means of dealing with rain and have developed numerous protection devices such as umbrellas and raincoats, and diversion devices such as gutters and storm drains that lead rains to sewers. Many people find the scent during <b>and</b> <b>immediately</b> <b>after</b> rain pleasant or distinctive. The source of this scent is petrichor, an oil produced by plants, then absorbed by rocks and soil, and later released into the air during rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{kicked off}} the match, but within the first two minutes they had conceded a goal. A foul on Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy by United captain Roy Keane {{resulted}} in a Liverpool penalty, which Gary McAllister subsequently scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Minutes later, Liverpool were awarded a free kick, but McAllister was unable to score, hitting Manchester United's defensive wall. United had their first chance two minutes later, but Van Nistelrooy miscued his shot in front of goal. In the 11th minute, Liverpool's lead was almost extended as United midfielder Nicky Butt almost diverted a cross from Riise into his own goal. Five minutes later, Liverpool did extend their lead; United defender Jaap Stam slipped after Liverpool striker Emile Heskey headed the ball down to Michael Owen, allowing Owen to sidestep Gary Neville and place his shot into the United goal to make the score 2–0. The frustration of the United players was beginning to show <b>and</b> <b>immediately</b> <b>after</b> the goal, Paul Scholes was shown a yellow card for a challenge on Dietmar Hamann.|$|E
