40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to provide the reader {{with the ability to}} analyze the {{effectiveness}} of incentives and to document innovative approaches to incentive contracting that can be applied to Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) contracts. While a CPAF contract is a vehicle to obtain products or services needed by the Government, it also acts as a management tool for the <b>awarding</b> <b>entity,</b> which focuses on the impact of meeting or exceeding award criteria. The need for improved procurement effectiveness necessitates the exploration of innovative arrangements. Contracting officers must take advantage of reforms and become innovative in their approach to provide best value in programs. More efficient ways of doing business are available and must be capitalized upon. Changes in the regulations have given the contracting officer the freedom to innovate. They must use this new freedom in order to meet DoD's expanding requirements with increasingly limited resources. The use of innovative incentives to contractor performance is beginning a period of renaissance. Numerous Government entities have embraced the use of innovative arrangements in the effort to get goods and services better, faster, and cheaper. The contracting officer must determine which incentives are most effective for a program based upon numerous variables. U. S. Marine Corps (U. S. M. C.) author...|$|E

40|$|Among {{the many}} {{amendments}} {{found in the}} Food and Drug Administration Amendment Act of 2007 (FDAAA) is a provision {{at the end of}} the act, Section 505 (u), which grants chiral switches five years of market exclusivity under certain circumstances. Prior to Congressional enactment of the FDAAA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to <b>award</b> new chemical <b>entity</b> (NCE) status to enantiomers of previously approved racemic mixtures. The FDA defines a new chemical entity (2 ̆ 2 NCE 2 ̆ 2) as a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other application submitted under Section 505 (b) of the FDCA. 3 According to the FDA, NCEs are by definition innovative and represent significant changes from already-approved drug products, such as a new use. Granting five years of market exclusivity to chiral switches mimics the exclusivity accorded to NCEs. This policy change may be rewarding innovation that has either gone unrecognized as patentable by the Federal Circuit or has been recognized as patentable under a unique set of qualifying standards by the Federal Circuit. From this perspective, it may appear as though Congress, by enacting Section 505 (u), has somehow done an end-run around the patent system by allowing exclusivity where none has been previously offered. This Comment, however, argues that Section 505 (u) will have a limited effect on drug development incentives and generic entrance into the marketplace because the ease with which most racemic mixtures may be resolved and the need for developing safe drugs in the first instance to gain FDA market approval points away from continued development of racemic drugs. In other words, Section 505 (u) is time-limited because drug companies today are almost exclusively pursuing single enantiomer drugs...|$|R
40|$|The Indian Self Determination Act {{was first}} {{ratified}} November 4, 1975, {{has brought about}} many social and economic changes for the Recognized Native American 2 ̆ 2 Indian 2 ̆ 2 Tribes of the United States. With this Act, the Department of the Interior, Division of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, officially recognized the right of organized 2 ̆ 2 Indian Tribes 2 ̆ 2 to be sovereign nations. This recognition created the opportunity for Native American Tribes {{to develop their own}} system of government, which included criminal and civil justice systems, social welfare programs, free practice of cultural and religious rituals, and the ability to contract with businesses in the private sector as an independent nation and a private business entity. The Self Determination Act was {{based on the premise that}} Native American Indian Tribes had, or could learn, to govern themselves under the nurturing and direction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. This Act was also intended to relieve the Bureau of Indian Affairs of direct responsibility for the social and economic welfare and overall governing of the Indian nations. With the ratification of the Indian Self Determination Act, the role of the Bureau of Indian Affairs was modified greatly. They were no longer the governing body over the individual Indian Tribes, officially at this point, they are simply the mentors in the Tribes 2 ̆ 7 process of acquiring strong business and self-governing techniques. Since the original ratification of the Indian Self Determination Act, Title I, Volume 25, Code of Federal Regulations; there have been many discrepancies over the appropriate implementation of this self-governing process. Consequently, the Self Determination Act was amended repeatedly between 1975 and 1989. Each amendment making it more clear that the Indian nations were expected to achieve self-government under the diminished influence of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The achievement of self-government gave the Indian nations the right to perform as private business entities. With the one exception of extreme cases of mismanagement, in which instance, the Bureau could reclaim control of any and all Tribal government and contracting procedures. However, in practice, Tribal governments were becoming increasingly tangled in legal battles with the Bureau of Indian Affairs over the definition and implementation of rights that had been granted to them in the Indian Self Determination Act. There have been numerous instances of Tribal government grants and contracts being officially <b>awarded</b> by private <b>entities</b> or Federal and local governments only to be withheld due to objections raised by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Consequently, the Tribes began to lean more heavily toward contracting for goods and services as independent, private businesses. With the recent enactment of the Indian Self Determination Act of 1974, the Native American Tribal Community has emerged as a force in the United States business arena. As a Tribal Administrator, the author has had the opportunity to explore, research, and experience first-hand the effects enactments of the Indian Self Determination Act are having on the freedom and ability of Native American Tribal people to become sovereign nations and to contract as independent financial entities. Most importantly, from the perspective of this study, the enactment of the Indian Self Determination Act is a doorway for introducing Native American Tribal governments as a sector of the private business arena. The focus of this study is the effects of the Indian Self Determination Act on the Native American Tribes 2 ̆ 7 potential for forming, owning, and operating as profitable business entities in the future...|$|R
40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the administration of procurement initiatives to support opportunities for Indigenous Australians. Audit objective, criteria and scope The objective of the audit was to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} administration of procurement initiatives to support opportunities for Indigenous Australians. To conclude against this objective the ANAO adopted high-level criteria which considered the effectiveness of the administration by PM&C and Finance of the IOP and IBE respectively. The criteria also considered the application of these policies by selected entities and the overall monitoring and reporting of outcomes achieved. The scope of the audit included: 	the application of the IOP since 2011 by selected Australian Government entities and its overall administration by PM&C, and formerly by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR); and 	the use of the exemption for Indigenous businesses in the CPRs by selected Australian Government entities and the administration of the exemption by Finance since 2011. The application of the IOP and the IBE was examined in the following entities: 	Department of Defence (Defence); 	Australian Taxation Office (ATO); 	Department of Human Services (DHS); 	Department of Employment (Employment); 	Department of Industry and Science (Industry); and 	Department of Education and Training. The ANAO also considered aspects of the Indigenous Procurement Policy which commenced from 1 July 2015, insofar as the experience of the IOP and IBE is relevant to its implementation. Overall conclusion Procurement Connected Policies (PCPs) to improve Indigenous economic outcomes have been used in various forms by the Australian Government since 1998. Through the Indigenous Opportunities Policy (IOP) and the Indigenous Business Exemption (IBE), a two-tiered approach was developed that sought to increase Indigenous involvement in the government supply chain, both directly as suppliers and indirectly through training and employment opportunities. Indigenous organisations have generally played a significant part in the delivery of government services funded through grant programs but the participation of Indigenous businesses in government procurement has remained very low. Overall, while the policy intent to leverage better Indigenous outcomes from Australian Government procurement activity has been clear, the frameworks developed by entities to achieve the objectives have not generally facilitated effective delivery of the outcomes sought. Key factors in this respect include the geographical limitations placed on the application of the IOP, the absence of any requirement for procuring entities to drive or monitor outcomes including those resulting from either their own or their suppliers actions, and the voluntary reporting requirements placed on entities which have hindered the ability of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) and the Department of Finance (Finance) to analyse activity and provide advice to government. A number of these issues are being addressed {{in the development of the}} new policy arrangements from 1 July 2015, although achieving the intended policy outcomes is likely to require continued efforts by government entities. In developing the IOP framework, a significant population was defined as being one where the proportion of the Indigenous population of a region was equal to or higher than the national average. This relative approach, however, had the effect of excluding areas, particularly urban areas, where there were significant Indigenous populations in absolute rather than relative terms. As a result, the geographic regions where the IOP applied until June 2015 included only 73  per cent of the total Indigenous population and did not generally include urban and some regional areas where economic activity was likely to be higher and more diverse. The geographic requirements of the IOP also provided practical challenges to its application by entities. Entities were required to determine whether contracts over certain values should have been identified as being subject to the IOP based on the physical location of the main contract activity. IOP regions were determined and publicised by PM&C, and it provided guidelines for entities and businesses. However, in cases where contracted activity occurred in multiple locations, including in both IOP and non-IOP regions, the interpretation of the requirements was not always straightforward and implementation by the entities included as part of this audit was not always consistent. More broadly, the data systems of audited entities often did not sufficiently capture the geographical locations where the main contracted activity was to take place and generally a limited record was maintained of decisions in relation to whether the IOP should be applied to particular approaches to market. In order to minimise the additional workload on procuring entities arising from the introduction of the IOP, entities were required only to take steps to ensure that a supplier has an approved IOP plan in place prior to issuing a contract. These plans were to provide details of the suppliers’ commitments in relation to Indigenous employment, training and business opportunity. Suppliers were required to implement these commitments if <b>awarded</b> a contract. <b>Entities,</b> however, were not required to include any of the supplier’s commitments under the plan into the contract nor to monitor the implementation of any of those commitments as part of managing the contracts. Instead, PM&C—and prior to that the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) —had the responsibility to monitor that entities are appropriately identifying contracts to which the IOP applied and to receive the required reports from suppliers about the implementation of their IOP plans. While PM&C, and previously DEEWR, made appropriate efforts to fulfil this responsibility, the voluntary nature of entity reporting and data limitations, where the geographical location of contracts is not recorded in the government’s procurement database (AusTender), means that relevant information upon which to assess implementation was not easily accessible. As a result PM&C was not well positioned to advise government on the extent that the IOP contributed to the desired objective of creating economic opportunities for Indigenous Australians, or on the extent that Australian Government entities were appropriately implementing the IOP. To complement the IOP and improve direct access for Indigenous business as suppliers to government, the Indigenous Business Exemption (IBE) allows entities to conduct streamlined procurement processes with Indigenous businesses within the Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs). Although the IBE has been available under the procurement framework since 2011, use of the IBE was low in the entities examined by the ANAO and there is no aggregated reporting by Finance on the use of the exemption by Australian Government entities. Based on available data, the involvement of Indigenous businesses in government purchasing is very limited. Since 2011, 120 contracts with Indigenous businesses certified through Supply Nation have been listed on AusTender. Of these, only 17 were listed as limited tender procurements over the relevant financial threshold and where the exemption may have been applied. Using the IBE requires procurement officers to consider choosing a procurement method on the basis of the indigeneity of the supplier and, at times, with limited information on the strength and distribution of the Indigenous supplier market. These decisions are required early in the procurement process and require entity staff to assess the value for money represented by an Indigenous business proposal in the absence of a competitive assessment process, requiring other information to be sought in order to make an assessment of value for money. While the IBE may shorten the timeframes of some procurements by removing the need for an open tender process to occur, the additional steps (scanning the market for suitable Indigenous supplier(s) and approaching them for a quote) and decisions (assessing the value for money offering of a supplier in the absence of an open approach to market) outside of the more commonly used procedures, may also be contributing to the low levels of application of the IBE. Some Indigenous businesses interviewed by the ANAO reported that use of the IBE was generally only considered by entity staff when support for its use was advocated by a sufficiently senior officer of the entity, and that committed leadership was a key element present in the cases when their approaches to entities resulted in the use of the IBE. However, Indigenous businesses reported that in most cases, their approaches to entities did not result in the use of the IBE being actively considered as a procurement method. From 1 July 2015, Australian Government portfolios are required to report performance against agreed targets for the level of contracting with Indigenous business, and to set aside some contracts for which Indigenous businesses will be approached, on a value for money basis, prior to any approach to the open market. Based on current performance, both in terms of the low level of entity use of Indigenous suppliers and in terms of oversight, monitoring and reporting arrangements, successful implementation of these new policy requirements will need increased promotion and support. The Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP) introduces flexibility in the way entities can approach their targets including by: setting them at portfolio levels; allowing sub-contracting opportunities to be included; applying a formula to enable the conversion of the target from number of contracts by volume to a target by contract values; and including contracts with Joint Ventures which have at least 25  per cent Indigenous equity. Nonetheless, the targets are ambitious. There are risks in seeking to move quickly to meet the new targets and entities will need to be vigilant to ensure that the requirements of the procurement framework, including achieving procurement outcomes economically and efficiently, continue to be met in addition to meeting the targets. While the IPP is the overarching framework in relation to Indigenous procurement policy, some elements of the IOP have remained, including the use of geographically-defined areas. In view of the experience of entities to date there would be merit in PM&C further reviewing the approach to determine the conditions under which the proposed minimum Indigenous participation requirements may be most effectively applied, particularly those relating to the use of Indigenous businesses by government suppliers. The ANAO has made three recommendations to assist PM&C and Finance to better implement, monitor and report on initiatives seeking to increase opportunities for Indigenous Australians through government procurement...|$|R
40|$|Although various {{pieces of}} European {{secondary}} law law use the terms "mise en concurrence" ("calling for competition" or "competitive tendering procedure") they provide no {{definition of the}} expression "obligation de mise en concurrence" ("obligation to call for competition"). At the very beginning, the author therefore defines what is meant thereby in his thesis, i. e. "a more or less formalized action which a public or a private person has to follow in order to provoke a competition or a contest between potentially interested persons that perform an economic activity, in order to grant an individual advantage to one or several of them". The {{first part of the}} work deals with the regime of competitive tendering of the public procurement directives which the Court of Justice has considered "as a whole" to be the "core" of European law on public contracts. First, this part examins the development of the public procurement directives from 1971 on. The author shows that the puzzling evolution of the personal scope of the public procurement directives is guided by the personal scope of European primary law. While considering the remedies directives, the author examines to what extent they introduce requirements beyond the principle of effective judicial protection. While some of their requirements obviously do so, the remedies directives however remain very far from standardizing the means of redress at national level. Due to the member States' judicial autonomy, the compelling force of EU primary law differs from one member State to another. The same applies within the scope of the remedies directives as they let the member States a large degree of autonomy. The author then turns to examine the contribution of the procurement directives 2004 / 17 /CE, 2004 / 18 /CE and 2009 / 81 /CE, their scope of application, as well as the concepts of public works concession and service concession. Various other questions are dealt with in the first part, {{such as the use of}} functional interpretation, the power of the European legislator to adopt regulations on public procurement and the impact of the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), the Revised GPA and other international agreements. At last the author explores the issue of electronic procurement and the Commission's proposals for replacing the public procurement directives 2004 / 17 /CE and 2004 / 18 /CE and its proposal concerning the award of concession contracts. The second part of of the thesis focuses on primary public procurement law. After having described the origin of the obligation to call for competition under EU primary law which the Court of Justice derives from articles 49 and 56 TFEU as well as from the principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality, the author strives to determine whether this obligation is well-founded. This examination brings to light that the rationale behind the requirement to call for competition under EU primary law is rather fragile. Amongst others, the author comes to the conclusion that the condition of a certain cross-border interest of each public contract individually as a condition for the application of the primary law obligation to call for competition lacks relevance The author then reviews and examines other possible bases for an obligation to call for competition under EU primary law such as the right to good administration, the freedom of enterprise and the right to property, which are protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. Finally, it seems that only article 102 TFEU (abuse of a dominant position) could to a limited extent give rise to an obligation to call for competition. However, once a situation is governed by EU secondary law, it enters the scope of European law. Hence, the principles of equal treatment and of non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality apply even if a situation involves no cross-border interest. If the Court of justice's case law were followed consistently, these principes should lead to require calls for competition in a number of purely internal situations. According to the author, deducing as precise consequences as does the Court of justice from the principal of equal treatment and other fundemental principles can hardly be justified. After that examination, the material rules of public procurement primary law stated by the Court of Justice and the General Court are successively reviewed. The pages that follow are about the exceptions to the obligation to call for competition under the public procurement directives and under primary law, as for instance articles 51 and 52 TFEU, overriding reasons of general interest and article 106, paragraph 2, TFEU. The author thereafter addresses the question whether primary law applies within the scope of secondary law. He comes to the conclusion that it does even when secondary law represents an exhaustive body of rules. Notwithstanding some ambiguous judgements of the Court of justice there is no support for the doctrine of priority of application of secondary law in the Court's case law. In what follows, the author tries to answer the question whether, in order to stay consistent with the case law developed in the wake of Telaustria, the obligation to call for competition which the case law of the Court of Justice requires for public works, service and supply contracts ought to be extended to other operations (sale or lease of real estate, design contests outside the scope of the public procurement directives, employment contracts, subsidised contracts <b>awarded</b> by private <b>entities</b> outside the scope of the public procurement directives, grants, …). The end of the second part deals with the personal scope of the primary law of public procurement which corresponds to that of EU primary law. The rules concerning State aid are addressed in detail in the third part of the thesis. The examination in that part shows that the public procurement directives, the primary law of public procurement and the EU state aid rules apply cumulatively. The EU State aid rules require efficency when awarding public contracts. Nevertheless, in order to avoid the categorization as State aid, a call for competition is never formally required. The Commission however insists on calls for competition in order to declare certain aids compatible with the internal market. Aids include by definition an advantage for their recipients. This remains true even though an aid has been authorised by the Commission pursuant to article 107, paragraphe 3, TFEU. Given the very broad scope the Court of Justice gives to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services, aid measures give generally rise to obstacles to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services. At the risk of rendering article 107, paragraph 3, TFEU unnecessary, the fact that an aid measure impedes the fundamental freedoms of the internal market should therefore not prevent the Commission to declare it compatible with the internal market. This applies in particular to aids consisting in the award of a public contract that is covered only by EU primary law. That solution seems however excluded for public contracts within the scope of the public procurement directives. The Commission has adopted a broad concept of what is an "advantage" in the sense of the State aid rules. This leads the Commission to consider certain grants for environmental protection as State aid measures even though it may be difficult to dectect any kind of advantage. The Commission claims to control these measures in accordance with the rules of State aid control. On that occasion the Commission tends to make its consent subject to a call for competition in order to identify the projects that will be subsidized. A broad approach of the concept of undertaking leads to class as State aid various public infrastructure investments insofar they do not satisfy the private investor test. The Commission tends to make its consent to these investments subject to calls for competition. Such is notably the case regarding public investments in broadband network facilities. In the fourth part, the author examines a variety of secondary legislation imposing calls for competition other than the public procurement directives. These texts cover a wide range of areas and provide for competitive awards of various form and diverse content. Sometimes a requirement for competitive tendering is overtly expressed. At other times, it is implicit, indirect or just inchoate. Some advantages are awarded without a genuine competition or without any competition at all. Directive 2012 / 34 /CE establishing a single European railway area for instance sets principles for the allocation of "infrastructure capacity" (i. e the right to use a railway network). It does not employ such terms as "calling for competition". Where the infrastructure capacity is insufficient it has to be allocated in a fair and non discriminatory manner. The fee for using the railway network cannot be used as an award criterion. In some areas, competition in terms of price is the very basis of the system. This is true for the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme. It happens that competitive assignment occurs incidentally and in a non compulsory way as in the case of the milk quota regime. In other cases, e. g. certain situations covered by the internal electricity market regime, the system excludes calls for competition whereas they should be required according to primary procurement law principles. Under still other circumstances, i. e. the award of public service contracts for public passenger transport services, competitive tendering only needs to be strictly complied with after a transitional period. This can hardly be reconciled with the principles of primary procurement law. In some cases the rules in place are such, for example when awarding the universal postal service, that it seems doubtful that a competitive bidding following objective and transparent criteria is really possible. The European greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme relies on auctions for the allocation of gaz emission authorisations. At first, it does so to a limited extent. Such authorisations, called "allowances", are freely transferable. Thus a reallocation of allowances according to market mechanismes is made possible. The author sheds light on some major inconsistencies of the greenhouse gas emission trading scheme. The late deadline for surrendering allowances gives rise for several years to a surplus of allowances over the greenhouse gas emissions considered in the scheme. On the other hand, the costs for same amounts of greenhouse gas emitted at the same time may vary. This gives rise to a problem of equality. The author comes to the conclusion that the scheme has little capacity to reach the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least cost to the economy. The designation of the universal postal service providers implies to lay down rules as to how the net cost of the universal service is to be calculated, as well as to define appropriate award criteria. These steps face considerable difficulties. A similar situation can be found in other areas such as electronic communications and electricity or natural gas transmission or distribution systems. In the latter case, the risk of a change of transmission or distribution tariffs due to decisions of national regulatory authorities leaves the competitors in the dark on a crucial point. The legislation regarding the internal electricity market and the internal gaz market puts the transmission and distribution system operators in a position very similar to that of service or public works concession holders. In some cases the principles which underlie these schemes exclude competitive tendering as required by primary procurement law. The networks being freely transferable, ownership of networks and hence, in principle, their operators are determined by private market mechanismes mainly through the level of the proposed sales price. This is not consistent with the principles of primary procurement law stated by the Court of Justice (advertising requirements, award criteria linked to the subject matter of the contract, [...] .). Neither does it seem compatible with these principles that the development of the networks belongs automatically to the transmission and distribution system operators. The assessment of conformity of secondary legislation with primary law is less strict than the conformity assessment of national law. The Court of Justice has allowed the European legislator a wide margin of discretion when establishing the internal market and seems to have tacitely acknowledged a form of conformity presumption of secondary law. Save in exceptional cases, it seems unlikely that the Court will put into question secondary law regimes differing from primary law procurement rules. Thus, the European legislator may adopt such solutions without incurring major legal risks...|$|R
