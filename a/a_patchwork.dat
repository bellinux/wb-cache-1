5|$|A strain {{known as}} Patch Hounds was {{developed}} by Willet Randall and his family from 1896 specifically for their rabbit hunting ability. They trace their bloodline back to Field Champion Patch, but do not necessarily have <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> marking.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Barnes & Noble called the writing style fluid and Children's Literature praised {{the story for}} being richly detailed. Kirkus Reviews {{compared}} the story to <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> of fantasy elements and characters, then concluded that it, despite being derivative, was exciting and held together well.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} eleven seasons of Doctor Who, often the {{surviving}} materials {{are in a}} very different format or condition from their original broadcast masters. Surviving 1960s material is recorded on film stock of varying quality, while early 1970s material is available in <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> of professional and consumer formats. To present the material in a form approximating its original broadcast masters requires extensive technical work, and a certain amount of invention.|$|E

5|$|Ireland {{continued}} as <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> of rival kingdoms but, {{beginning in the}} 7th century, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through {{the concept of a}} High King of Ireland. Medieval Irish literature portrays an almost unbroken sequence of High Kings stretching back thousands of years but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} of Nicholas Altomanović's lands created friction between Tvrtko and George of Zeta, since the latter seized coastal župas which Tvrtko {{had expected to}} annex. In early 1377, Tvrtko successfully plotted with the Travunians the takeover of Trebinje, Konavli, and Dračevica, making his final conquests of the Serbian lands. By that time, Serbia {{had been reduced to}} <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> of independent lordships.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the century, {{the many}} repairs {{undertaken}} since the memorial's construction had left <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> of materials and colours, and a disconcerting pattern of damage from water intrusion at the joints. In May 2001, the Government of Canada announced the Canadian Battlefield Memorials Restoration Project, a major C$30million restoration project to restore Canada's memorial sites in France and Belgium, in order to maintain and present them in a respectful and dignified manner. In 2005, the Vimy memorial closed for major restoration work. Veterans Affairs Canada directed the restoration of the memorial in cooperation with other Canadian departments, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, consultants and specialists in military history.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} for approximately 11,000 years, based on Clovis points discovered in the area. The first inhabitants were most likely the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede tribes of Native Americans, descendants of the first humans who traveled across the Bering land bridge from Siberia. They fished for salmon, trout, and lamprey, and hunted for deer and elk. They also often set fires to clear brush from prairies and oak savannas, and to promote the growth of certain crops. The fires were limited by the Native Americans, creating <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> of burned and unburned land, thus increasing the biodiversity of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|From 1925, Bayern {{shared the}} Grünwalder Stadion with 1860 Munich. Until World War II, the stadium {{was owned by}} 1860 Munich, and is still colloquially known as Sechz'ger ("Sixties") Stadium. It was {{destroyed}} during the war, and efforts to rebuild it resulted in <b>a</b> <b>patchwork.</b> Bayern's record crowd at the Grünwalder Stadion is reported as more than 50,000 in the home game against 1. FC Nürnberg in the 1961–62 season. In the Bundesliga era the stadium had a maximum capacity of 44,000 which was reached on several occasions, but the capacity has since been reduced to 21,272. As was the case at most of this period's stadiums, {{the vast majority of}} the stadium was given over to terracing. Today the second teams of both clubs play in the stadium.|$|E
5|$|Some Denver streets have bicycle lanes, leaving <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> of disjointed routes {{throughout}} the city. There are over 850 miles of paved, off-road, bike paths in Denver parks and along bodies of water, like Cherry Creek and the South Platte. This {{allows for a}} significant portion of Denver's population to be bicycle commuters and has led to Denver being known as a bicycle-friendly city. Some local residents are very opposed to bike lanes, which have caused some plans to be watered down or nixed. The review process for one bike line on Broadway will last over a year before city council members will make a decision. In addition to the many bike paths, Denver launched B-Cycle– a citywide bicycle sharing program– in late April 2010. The B-Cycle network was the largest in the United States {{at the time of its}} launch, boasting 400 bicycles.|$|E

5|$|While the proem and {{invocation}} of Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi {{are composed of}} several original lines of Latin in addition to lines borrowed from or alluding to the Roman poet Virgil, the Silver Age poet Lucan, and the fourth-century poet Juvencus, {{the rest of the}} work is entirely a Virgilian cento, which is <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> poem of verses extracted from the works of Virgil. Proba's choice to rework Virgil seems to have been made for two reasons: First, Virgil was an influential poet who was commissioned by Caesar Augustus, the first Roman emperor, to write the epic Aeneid. The poet's influence was felt well into late antiquity, and he was imitated by Juvencus and Prudentius. The respect given to Virgil eventually manifested in centos, which reached their peak in the fourth century AD. Second, Virgil was often appropriated by Christian authors due to a popular interpretation of his fourth Eclogue, which many believed to be a prophecy of the birth of Jesus.|$|E
