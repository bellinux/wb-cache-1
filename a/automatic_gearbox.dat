50|$|In 1977 the Alfetta 2000, a two-litre {{upmarket}} Alfetta version, {{replaced the}} 2000 Berlina. The 2000 Berlina {{was produced in}} 89,840 examples, of which 2.200 units fitted with <b>automatic</b> <b>gearboxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Manual {{gearboxes}} {{dominated the}} early models, but <b>automatic</b> Tiptronic-style <b>gearboxes</b> (Jatco JF506E) became increasingly popular and were standard on the V6. The <b>Automatic</b> Tiptronic <b>gearbox</b> was also available {{as an option}} on the Td4.|$|R
25|$|The ET model range stuck true to the wasp/aero design principles. It was lighter, more aerodynamic, had an <b>automatic</b> <b>gearbox</b> {{and could}} take a series of engines from a 50cc in either {{two-stroke}} or four-stroke, up to a 150cc four stroke.|$|E
25|$|Particular {{versions}} {{of the first generation}} Punto were the Punto 6Speed, a 1.1 FIRE Punto 55 with a six speed gearbox, the Punto Selecta with a CVT type <b>automatic</b> <b>gearbox,</b> and the Punto ED (Economical Drive), a 1.1 Punto whose five speed gearbox was designed for high fuel efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Rover's {{plans to}} use its then fairly new 2.2L four-cylinder engine were soon {{abandoned}} as BL management ruled that substantially redesigned versions of Triumph's six-cylinder engine were to power the car instead. The Rover V8 engine was fitted in the engine bay. The three-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>gearbox</b> was the BorgWarner 65 model.|$|E
5000|$|It was outsold by the {{conventional}} manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>gearboxes</b> {{in both the}} Aska and Gemini and subsequently dropped {{in the next generation}} Gemini. (Isuzu stopped manufacturing the Aska in-house after the first generation.) ...|$|R

25|$|The V8 {{engine was}} offered in larger 3.5 and 4.2-litre sizes {{as well as}} a {{supercharged}} 4.2-litre. The car's lighter weight meant the 3.0-litre V6 was also offered, although with the later introduction of the 2.7-litre V6 diesel the V6 petrol version was discontinued (neither V6 petrol nor diesel were available in US markets). A new six-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>gearbox</b> was fitted which was lighter and offered better economy with lock-up on all gears and a larger spread of ratios.|$|E
25|$|The car's 3-phase AC {{induction}} {{electric motor}} produced 137 brake horsepower (102kW) at 7000 rpm. Like electric trains and all vehicles {{with an electric}} motor (and unlike a car powered by an internal combustion engine), the EV1 could deliver its full torque capacity throughout its power band, producing 110 pound-feet (149 newton-meters) of torque anywhere between 0 and 7000 rpm, allowing the omission of a manual or <b>automatic</b> <b>gearbox.</b> Power was delivered to the front wheels through a single-speed reduction integrated transmission.|$|E
25|$|The V70 XC, also {{referred}} to as V70 AWD Cross Country, was introduced in September 1997 on the Frankfurt Auto Show for the 1998 model year as a crossover version of the V70. It featured standard all-wheel drive and was available with only two engine and gearbox choices. In the US only the 2.4L turbo engine together with an <b>automatic</b> <b>gearbox</b> was available. A 2.0L version of the V70 XC was available only for markets with high taxes on cars with more than 2000cc engine capacity. Standard ride height was increased by 2.6cm over the regular AWD model.|$|E

50|$|The TecnoTren is {{available}} in 1, 2 and 3 carriage configurations, {{all of which have}} disc brakes, <b>automatic</b> <b>gearboxes</b> and a maximum range of 700 km. All components of the railbus are disc brakes made in Argentina, {{with the exception of the}} engine which is no longer in production.|$|R
50|$|Fuzzy logic {{controllers}} {{have been}} developed for <b>automatic</b> <b>gearboxes</b> in automobiles (the 2006 Audi TT, VW Touareg and VW Caravell feature the DSP transmission which utilizes fuzzy logic, a number of Škoda variants (Škoda Fabia) also currently include a fuzzy logic-based controller). Camera sensors widely utilize fuzzy logic to enable focus.|$|R
25|$|It was an {{innovative}} design and used lightweight aluminium along with techniques developed in aircraft production during World War II. As {{well as a}} novel, weight-saving integral design, it also introduced {{for the first time}} on a bus independent front suspension, power steering, a fully <b>automatic</b> <b>gearbox</b> and power-hydraulic braking. This surprised some early drivers, who found the chassis unexpectedly light and nimble compared with older designs, especially as depicted on film on tests at the Chiswick Works skid pan. Footage of RM200 undergoing the skid test at Chiswick was included in the 1971 film On the Buses.|$|E
25|$|Rover took a {{controlling}} interest in Alvis in 1965 and a Rover-designed mid-engined V8 coupé prototype named the P6BS was rumoured {{to be the}} new Alvis model but with the takeover by British Leyland this too was shelved. By the time the TF 21 was launched in 1966, (available, like its predecessors in both saloon and drophead form and with either manual or <b>automatic</b> <b>gearbox),</b> the model was beginning to show its age despite a top speed of 127mph – the fastest Alvis ever produced. With only 109 sold and with political troubles aplenty in the UK car manufacturing business at that time, production finally ceased in 1967.|$|E
25|$|The Indian {{version of}} the Corolla known as the 'Corolla Altis' is {{assembled}} in Bidadi near Bangalore. The pre-facelift version (2008–2010) had a 1.8-litre ZZ engine with 132bhp mated to a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>gearbox.</b> A 1.4-litre 1ND-TV diesel engine unique to India and Spain with 88bhp mated to a 6-speed manual gearbox debuted in 2010. In 2011, the Altis was face-lifted and the older ZZ engine {{was replaced by a}} Modern 1.8 ZR engine producing 140bhp and was mated to a 6-speed manual like the diesel while a 7-speed CVT gearbox replaced the outdated 4-speed automatic. The diesel was left untouched mechanically and had a different grill to differentiate it from the petrol.|$|E

50|$|Meccano {{remains a}} very {{versatile}} constructional medium. Almost any mechanical device {{can be built}} with it, from structures, to complex working cranes, <b>automatic</b> <b>gearboxes</b> or clocks. Meccano is frequently used to prototype new ideas and inventions. Model realisation using Meccano is limited mainly by the imagination and ingenuity of the builder.|$|R
25|$|In April 2013 the Series II Cruze {{received}} an update and price drops. The update included rear-parking sensors, a 7-inch touch-screen, suspension adjustments and improved <b>automatic</b> <b>gearboxes</b> across the range {{along with many}} other new extras such as a larger 1.6-liter turbocharged engine as standard on the SRi and SRi-V, replacing the 1.4-liter turbo.|$|R
25|$|The North American cars {{also had}} {{different}} equipment levels (depending on the version: Milano Silver, Milano Gold or Milano Platinum). L/h and r/h electrically adjustable outside mirrors, electrically reclining seats and cruise control were usually optional in Europe. The car was also available with a 3-speed ZF <b>automatic</b> <b>gearbox</b> {{option for the}} 2.5 V6. Other, more common options such as electrically operated rear windows and an A/C system were standard in the USA. The USA-cars also had different upholstery styles and of course different dashboard panels also indicating speed in mph, oil pressure in psi and coolant temperature in degrees F, and as a final touch the AR control was different, including a seat belt warning light.|$|E
25|$|In 2001/02, {{under new}} Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, Transport for London {{purchased}} 50 RMs {{from a variety}} of sources, including Reading Mainline and two from Italy. Of these, 43 were refurbished by Marshall Bus between May 2001 and August 2002, receiving Cummins engines coupled to an Allison <b>automatic</b> <b>gearbox.</b> They also received a full body overhaul including new hopper windows. The first 22 were leased to London Sovereign for use on route 13 with ten going to Arriva London for use on route 38 and others to First London, London Central and London United. After Marshall Bus went into administration, Arriva London completed a further six, albeit without the heavy body overhauls and retaining the quarter-drop windows.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the Logan branded as Renault Tondar 90 {{began to}} be marketed in Iran by Renault-Pars, {{manufactured}} by Pars Khodro and Iran Khodro. In {{the first month of}} production more than 100,000 Tondar 90 had been ordered. Renault Pars is a joint venture, 51 percent of which belongs to Renault of France. Forty-nine percent of Renault Pars' shares is jointly held by Iran's Industrial Development and Renovation Organization, IKCO and Saipa Group. The company was established in 2003. In 2010, Pars Khodro started to produce CNG Tondar 90s which can run on both petrol and CNG. Pars Khodro stopped producing CNG models in 2012. In 2013 IKCO started to produce Tondar 90s with <b>automatic</b> <b>gearbox.</b> The price tag is about 3,400 dollars. IKCO also made the Tondar 90 comply with Euro IV standards.|$|E
50|$|Technical adaptations {{enabled the}} {{production}} of this engine in many displacements in single and dual carburettor forms, later with fuel injection, with or without turbo. The Cléon-Fonte was coupled initially to four-speed manual transmissions, and then later five speed and <b>automatic</b> <b>gearboxes</b> according to its applications and the natural progress of the automotive industry.|$|R
