On the other hand, arguments based on the anonymity of electronic <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> suggest that adverse selection may be a more severe problem and that, therefore, bid-ask spreads may be higher. The present paper addresses the issue of transaction costs in floor and computerized <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> empirically. In Germany, floor and screen trading for the same stocks exist in parallel. Both markets are liquid and operate simultaneously for several hours each day. An analysis of the bid-ask spreads reveals that the electronic <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> is relatively less attractive for less liquid stocks. The market shares of the competing systems reveal a similar pattern. The market share of the electronic <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> is negatively related to the total trading volume of the stock, is positively related to the difference between spreads on the floor and in the screen <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> and is at least partially negatively related to return volatility. We further document that spreads in the electronic <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> respond more heavily to changes in return volatility and that the adverse selection component of the spread is larger.
