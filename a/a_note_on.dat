5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>on</b> torsion, Thompson {{mentions}} Charles Darwin's {{treatment of}} climbing plants which often spiral around a support, noting that Darwin also {{observed that the}} spiralling stems were themselves twisted. Thompson disagrees with Darwin's teleological explanation, that the twisting makes the stems stiffer {{in the same way}} as the twisting of a rope; Thompson's view is that the mechanical adhesion of the climbing stem to the support sets up a system of forces which act as a 'couple' offset from the centre of the stem, making it twist.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} modern editions of Sherman's memoirs. The edition most useful for {{research}} purposes is the 1990 Library of America version, edited by Charles Royster.

5|$|In 2002, P. Mausfeld and D. Vrcibradic {{published}} <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>on</b> the nomenclature of the Noronha skink {{informed by}} a re-examination of Gray's original type specimens; despite extensive attempts to correctly name the species, they were apparently {{the first to}} do so since Boulenger in 1887. Based on differences {{in the number of}} scales, subdigital lamellae (lamellae on the lower sides of the digits), and keels (longitudinal ridges) on the dorsal scales (located on the upperparts), as well as the separation of the parietal scales (on the head behind the eyes) in maculata, they concluded that the two were not, after all, identical, and that Schmidt's name Mabuya atlantica should therefore be used. Mausfeld and Vrcibradic considered Mabouya punctatissima to represent a different species on the basis of morphological differences, but were unable to resolve the status of Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May 2012, Chelsea {{released}} <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>on</b> {{their official}} website announcing that Drogba {{would leave the}} club when his contract expired {{at the end of}} June 2012.

It was reported that he signed a two-and-a-half-year deal where he will earn £200,000 a week. On 22 July, Drogba made his debut for Shanghai Shenhua in a 1–1 away draw against Guangzhou R, coming on as a substitute for Brazilian defender Moisés in the second half. He assisted Cao Yunding's equaliser in the 67th minute. On 4 August, he scored his first two goals in a 5–1 win against Hangzhou Greentown. He scored two more goals on 25 August, both set up by Anelka, as Shenhua drew 3–3 with Shandong Luneng.|$|E
