2500|$|In most non-U.S. casinos, a 'no hole card' game is played, {{meaning that}} the dealer does not draw nor consult his or her second card until after all players have {{finished}} making decisions. With no hole card, it is almost never correct basic strategy to double or split against <b>a</b> <b>dealer</b> ten or ace, since <b>a</b> <b>dealer</b> blackjack {{will result in the}} loss of the split and double bets; the only exception is with a pair of <b>A's</b> against <b>a</b> <b>dealer</b> 10, where it is still correct to split. In all other cases, a stand, hit or surrender is called for. For instance, holding 11 against <b>a</b> <b>dealer</b> 10, the correct strategy is to double in a hole card game (where the player knows the dealer's second card is not an ace), but to hit in a no hole card game. [...] The no hole card rule adds approximately 0.11% to the house edge.|$|R
