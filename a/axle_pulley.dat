5000|$|Ed Leedskalnin and his megalithic creation, Rock Gate, {{better known}} as Coral Castle, {{became a part of}} the American popular culture due to the {{magnitude}} of a single man's effort, perseverance, and determination. With the advent of the Internet, Leedskalnin's fame spread far beyond Florida. Along with the recognition came speculations about his seemingly superhuman powers: either it was his purported access to alien technology or esoteric ancient knowledge, or his assumed ability to levitate blocks of stone and move them with the aid of the Earth's magnetic energy. Other currently available explanations center on Leedskalnin's stonemason and logging experiences that presumably allowed him to apply his work skills creatively to a tedious process of moving large blocks of stone using levers, wheels, <b>axles,</b> <b>pulleys,</b> ramps, and wedges without any power equipment.|$|R

40|$|The pace in {{swimming}} {{is very important}} because it allows swimmers to allocate their forces accordingly, and therefore a distance to travel as quickly as possible. The training pace at different swimmingspeeds and combinations thereof, {{is an important part}} of training before the competitions. The definition and maintenance of the stable and swimmer specific speed is difficult to achieve and requires considerable effort and experience. To determine the desired rate of accuracy by the researchers and their coaches used till now, various audio and visual media. However, some of these institutions did not very accurately measure the rate and not all styles of swimming, while other aspects affect the proper swimming. In this construction, a key objective is to solve the problems occurring in the previous constructions, the modern technological development of them and the adaption of the specificities of different swimming styles. This device consists of an electro 3 / 8 of the horse, a flange, a single inverter from 3 / 8 to ½ of the horse, pulleys with taper Bush, flange <b>axle,</b> <b>pulleys,</b> platforms and a 52 meters cable. The assembly and operation is as follows: At the edge of the pool next to the platform is placed the base of pulleys, the electro setis connected to the inverter and the axle flange. Precisely opposite is positioned the other base. Along the pool «moves» the cable that connects the two bases, located 150 cm above the water. A fixed point on the cable is marked with paint in order to be visible to the swimmer during backstroke swimming while for other styles we adapt a lamination at the cable vertically inthe pool, above the surface a sheet of 15 cm which is painted with strong color that is visible from the athlete and will precede him. Setting the speed with inverter it starts from one end of the tank leading to the other, doing a circular motion. The swimmer is required to follow the marked point of the cable in the backstroke or lamination in other styles. Practical applications of the use of speed regulator: 1) Determination of constant speed (rate) of the athlete, without movement problems 2) Growth rate of change in perception of the athlete. 3) Verification ofproper technique 4) Training in the change of pace, planning and competition tactic...|$|R
50|$|Cobb showed and {{introduced}} {{the field of}} photovoltaics to a car show that had over 2,000,000 visitors. At the time all automobiles were run by gasoline engines. Cobb's Sunmobile model had 12 selenium photoelectric cells {{on top of a}} balsa wood body. These solar cells were connected in series-parallel and converted the sun light directly into electricity, which in turn ran a small low-inertia electric motor. The motor rotated at 2000 r.p.m. and ran on 1.5 volts. The motor's energy in turn was transferred to the model car's drive shaft, which then in turn transferred the energy through its rear <b>axle</b> by a <b>pulley</b> to the car's wheels which moved the car forward.|$|R

Hammer mill is to use high-speed rotation of the hammer and the principle of material impact to crush material,which has advantage of crushing efficiency, organization simple, crushing ratio, low cost processing, operation stability and adapting {{to a wide range}} of materials, etc[1] Hammer mill is now widely used in various types of ores, building materials, cement, abrasives, glass raw materials, artificial materials and a variety of metallurgical slag gravel crushing and rough grinding operations, Large hammer crusher, especially on medium hard, especially hard, and abrasion of material is more advantages than the other type of grinder crusher[2]. However, hammer mill hammer impact machine is easy to wear is a major factor in the normal work, so we make their feasibility studies of laser coating with hammer. 1 Hammer Mill’s Overall Structure The hammer mill is usually carried out mainly by the rotor, sieve section, flywheel, <b>axle,</b> bearings, <b>pulleys,</b> and adjust the devices to combat board composition (see Fig 1) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{computed}} {{the experimental}} average {{coefficient of friction}} between a <b>pulley</b> <b>axle</b> and a <b>pulley</b> sheave {{in a system of}} three pulleys and four suspended weights in static equilibrium. The pulleys were suspended from the ceiling in a triangular arrangement, with the cords running over the pulleys attached in a knot with a constant suspended weight, while we altered the weights hanging from the other ends of the cords. After allowing the system to settle into an initial equilibrium state, we then manually found the equilibrium from above the equilibrium point and from below. We measured the location of the knot and the pulleys in three-space, as the difference in the location of the central knot changed due to the friction of the pulleys. Our calculated averages for the coefficients of friction of pulleys 1, 2, and 3 were. 03515 ±. 2,. 01582 ±. 2, and. 0469 ±. 2, respectively. Purpose: We will measure the coefficient of static friction between the axle and the sheave of a pulley by analyzing a three-dimensional system of forces. Theory: Pulleys are often assumed ideal, or massless and frictionless, in order to simplify analysis of pulley systems. However, in real applications, pulleys have both mass and friction. While in the system analyzed in this laboratory the mass is insignificant, the friction between the axle and the sheave does affect our analysis. The friction in a pulley comes from the natural roughness of the materials used and any flaws in the surfaces of the axle or sheave. The friction then yields a force that opposes motion. By repeating many trials (i. e., many different suspended weights), we calculate the average coefficient of static friction, which reduces our uncertainty. Taking measurements from above and below the equilibrium point also aids in increasing the accuracy of our findings. This model of the pulley, with friction included, results in the following free body diagram...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{agricultural}} operations now {{demand the}} utilisation {{of a wide}} variety of equipment and specialist machinery systems, with many having rotary elements such as <b>axles,</b> gears, <b>pulleys</b> etc. With these agricultural machinery systems which have rotary elements, uncontrolled vibrations may become an important problem to consider. When the initial ‘switch-on’ frequency meets with the natural frequency of a machine element in the system, undesired noise, high levels of vibration and mechanical failures may occur during operation. In this regard, it is important to predict natural frequency modes of the elements under loading as a result of these vibrations. Computing capability and design software tools are able to assist design and analysis engineers to predict and evaluate natural and forced frequency modes of these elements. These computer aided applications in the engineering domain are typically referred to as Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) and have been used with success in industry for a long time. Hence, it can be shown that the use of CAE applications in the design and analysis processes of agricultural machinery systems could be beneficial. In this study, a finite element modal analysis on the larger pulley of a fodder crushing machine which was manufactured by a commercial company in Turkey, is presented. The torque and cycle of the pulley shaft measurements of the machine were conducted and the data used in the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to simulate resonance frequency modes. As a conclusion of the study, resonance frequency simulations were conducted and the results have been presented. Additionally, suggestions for reducing the undesired effect of vibration for the agricultural machinery systems are given...|$|R

It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE The apparatus and procedure for obtaining coefficient of friction values of bituminous and portland cement concrete pavements and bridge decks using a portable skid tester are described in this test method. B. APPARATUS 1. Skid testing unit A 2 -ply tire (200 mm rim height, 95 mm rim width, 425 mm tire height and a maximum overall tire width from 100 to 120 mm) with 170 ± 15 kPa air pressure manufactured with a smooth tread, together with rim, <b>axle,</b> and driving <b>pulley,</b> is mounted to a rigid frame. The tire is brought to the required test speed by a motor. A carriage moves on two parallel guides. Friction is reduced to a low uniform value with three roller bearings fitted at 120 ˚ points to bear against the guide rod at each corner of the carriage. Two guide rods are rigidly connected to the end frame bars. The front end of the guide bar frame assembly is firmly fastened to a bumper hitch to restrain forward movement. The bumper hitch provides for swinging the skid tester to the right or left after positioning the vehicle. The rear end of the frame assembly is raised by an adjustable knob to hold the tire 6 mm above the surface to be tested. This device is constructed so that the tire may be dropped instantaneously to the test surface by tripping the release arm. A tachometer indicates the speed of the tire in kilometers per hour. The springs are calibrated by procedures outlined i...|$|R
