25|$|Monty Cranfield was a right-arm leg {{break and}} off break bowler and a {{right-handed}} lower-order batsman who played fairly regularly for Gloucestershire {{both before and}} after the Second World War without ever really being certain of his place in the team. As a spin bowler, he coincided for much of his career with off-spinner Tom Goddard and then later with the slow left-arm spin bowler Sam Cook, both Test players and inevitable first-choice bowlers. As a result, he never achieved 50 wickets in a single English season, and nor did he ever bowl as many as 500 overs in a single season. As a batsman, though he often made useful runs, he had only one season, when he was 37 years old, when he was <b>anywhere</b> <b>close</b> to a front-line batsman.|$|E
25|$|I {{know that}} some people are getting very {{defensive}} about Black Swan and my role in it, but back-stabbing is not my purpose when people ask me about the legitimacy of the dance shots in the movie. I only care to speak the truth. The truth is that no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come <b>anywhere</b> <b>close</b> {{to the level of a}} professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that they deserve.|$|E

30|$|Suppose the {{objective}} of the sampling process is to obtain a simple random sample containing n individuals. The sampling is done using sample plots, each of area a, with their centres positioned at randomly chosen locations across the forest area. For geometric ease, it is most practical to use square, rectangular or circular plots although other plot shapes could be used. Plot centres are allowed to be located within an area slightly larger than the forest area, an area that is then considered to constitute the entire forest population being sampled. This area may be defined as a rectangle completely surrounding the forest area (Iles 2003, Fig. 5.02, p. 166). For circular plots, no side of the outer rectangle should be, <b>anywhere,</b> <b>closer</b> to the forest edge than the plot radius and for square or rectangular plots, no closer than half the length of the plot diagonal. Suppose the total area defined by the forest and its surrounding rectangle is then A. Locating plot centres at random within such a rectangle allows sampling near the forest edge to be done without use of the edge overlap methods mentioned earlier; any part of a sample plot that falls beyond the forest edge is then simply part of the total population being sampled as defined by the area A.|$|R

DuVernay estimated that she re-wrote 90 percent of Webb's original script. Those revisions included rewriting King's speeches, because, in 2009, King's estate licensed them to DreamWorks and Warner Bros. for an untitled project to be produced by Steven Spielberg. Subsequent negotiations between those companies and Selmas producers did not lead to an agreement. DuVernay drafted alternative speeches that evoke the historic ones without violating the copyright. She recalled spending hours listening to King's words while hiking the canyons of Los Angeles. While she did not think she would [...] "get <b>anywhere</b> <b>close</b> to just the beauty and that nuance of his speech patterns", she did identify some of King's basic structure, such as a tendency to speak in triplets (saying one thing in three different ways).

The staff of the Salt Tax Palace were thrown into panic as Puyi ordered all of his treasures to be boxed up and shipped out; in the meantime Puyi observed from his window that soldiers of the Manchukuo army were taking off their uniforms and deserting. To test the reaction of his Japanese masters, Puyi put on his uniform of Commander-in-Chief of the Manchukuo Army and announced [...] "We must support the holy war of our Parental Country with all our strength, and must resist the Soviet armies to the end, to the very end". With that, Yoshioka fled the room, which showed Puyi that the war was lost. At one point, a group of Japanese soldiers arrived at the Salt Tax Palace, and Puyi believed they had come to kill him, but they merely went away after seeing him stand at top of the staircase. Most of the servants and all of the cooks at the Salt Tax Palace fled, forcing Puyi to eat biscuits as his remaining servants hastily packed up all of the Qing treasures at the Salt Tax Palace. Puyi found that his phone calls to the Kwantung Army HQ went unanswered as most of the officers had already left for Korea, his minder Amakasu committed suicide by swallowing a cyanide pill and the people of Changchun booed him when his car with its imperial standards flying took him to the railroad station.|$|E

40|$|The sapwood fibers {{in green}} {{softwood}} are normally filled - or nearly filled - with free water. This water forms a continuous phase {{through the narrow}} bordered pits between fiber lumens. In a drying process water evaporates from the menisci formed at these narrow throats and initially located {{close to the surface}} of the wood. As the amount of free water decreases in this way, a retraction of the meniscus will happen in the widest throat, which can be located <b>anywhere,</b> not necessarily <b>close</b> to the surface. As the individual size of these narrow throats is a stochastic variable, this process will produce complicated water phase structures that gradually fragmentize. If this drying behavior is viewed as such an invasion percolation process it is obvious that the result differs from normal diffusion, which however most often is used as the basis for wood drying modeling. A computer based simulation model that utilizes the above principle has been developed. This model has been used for the simulation of a few situations of practical and theoretical importance. It has been found that this invasion percolation approach can reproduce some previously unexplained features seen in softwood drying processes.
