25|$|Scholar Andrew Whitehead {{states that}} Kashmiris view Kashmir {{as having been}} ruled by their own in 1586.

Whitehead states that this is only partly true: the Mughals lavished much affection and resources on Kashmir, the Dogras made Srinagar their capital next only to their native Jammu city, and {{through much of the}} post-independence India, Kashmiri Muslims headed the state government. Yet Kashmiris bear an 'acute sense of grievance' that they were not in control of their own fate for centurues.|$|E

All these plot theorists argue for the continuing influence of the Illuminati as Carr suggested it in his two main works.|$|E
25|$|It {{is an old}} {{trick of}} the Indian Office to blacken the {{character}} of any Indian that happens, notwithstanding the retardation caused by the Indian Bureau, to rise a little above the ranks. So as soon as an educated Indian begins to deplore the conditions of his brother Indians, the Indian Office dubs such a one a disturber, an agitator, <b>and</b> <b>lately</b> he {{is placed in the}} Bolshevik class. The whole Indian Bureau system of managing Indian business {{to the detriment of the}} Indian but for the benefit of a few greedy and voracious whites, is the most dramatic autocracy in existence the world over. Gradually through assistance of the American press, the generous hearted and justice loving American people are learning something of this present day Indian government humbuggery and deceit practiced by the Indian Office forces.|$|E

25|$|Underwater {{archaeology}} is archaeology practiced underwater. As {{with all}} other branches of archaeology, it evolved from its roots in pre-history and in the classical era to include sites from the historical and industrial eras. Its acceptance has been a relatively late development due to the difficulties of accessing and working underwater sites, and because the application of archaeology to underwater sites initially emerged from the skills and tools developed by shipwreck salvagers. As a result, underwater archaeology initially struggled to establish itself as bona fide archaeological research. The situation changed when universities began teaching the subject and when a theoretical and practical base for the sub-discipline was firmly established. Underwater archaeology now {{has a number of}} branches including, after it became broadly accepted in the late 1980s, maritime archaeology: the scientifically based study of past human life, behaviours and cultures and their activities in, on, around <b>and</b> (<b>lately)</b> under the sea, estuaries and rivers. This is most often effected using the physical remains found in, around or under salt or fresh water or buried beneath water-logged sediment. In recent years, the study of submerged WWII sites and of submerged aircraft in the form of underwater aviation archaeology have also emerged as bona fide activity.|$|E

Though KBK project was announced in the 1990s by central Government specially for undivided Kalahandi, Balangir and Koraput districts primarily keeping poverty, backwardness and starvation death in mind, undivided Kalahandi district continued to remain politically ignored for various reasons. Indira Gandhi visited Kalahandi in the early 1980s; Rajiv Gandhi visited in 1984; Sonia Gandhi visited in 2004, and Rahul Gandhi visited in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Since 1980, the Indian National Congress has been ruling for 20 years at the Centre; but the visits of the said VVIPs have contributed nothing {{to the development of}} Kalahandi. Despite late prime ministers Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, P.V.Narasimha Rao, and present leaders Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi etc. tall claims for developing Kalahandi, little was done for long term sustainable development in higher education, national highway, railway and industry during those leadership at Delhi. Few initiatives taken in post-independence of India for developing Kalahandi were only during non-congress rule in India such as Upper Indiravati Irrigation Project (during Moraji Desai as Prime Minister of India), Lanjigarh road - Jungarh (during Chandrasekhar as Prime Minister of India), National Highway 201 & 217 passing through Kalahandi (during Atal Bihari Vajpayee as Prime Minister of India), all these projects are not yet fully accomplished.|$|E
