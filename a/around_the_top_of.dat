5|$|Somerset {{became more}} stable in the {{aftermath}} of the post-invasion period and the unsuccessful 1068 rebellion against Norman rule. It was common in the period for the Normans to build religious houses to accompany major castles, and accordingly William de Mohun endowed a Benedictine priory at Dunster in 1090, along with its parent abbey at Bath. The River Avill was important for trade; the region around Dunster was rich with fisheries and vineyards, and Dunster Castle prospered. Stone fortifications were built on the site during the early 12th century, probably forming a shell keep <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the motte.|$|E
5|$|The Sounds {{rejoined the}} Cincinnati Reds farm system in 1987, {{this time as}} their Triple-A affiliate. As a result, a number of minor leaguers played in the Reds {{organization}} at two different levels with Nashville. Spending {{the beginning of the}} 1987 season <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the standings, the team hit a slump after losing a few key players midseason. The result was a 64–76 record under skipper Jack Lind and a last place finish. One player lost due to injuries was third baseman Chris Sabo. Sabo was promoted to Cincinnati in 1988 and was named the National League Rookie of the Year, a first for any former Sounds player.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on Friday 8November, the divisional surgeon had {{pronounced}} Sandra Rivett dead and forensic officers and photographers {{had been called}} to the property. Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, {{there was no sign}} of a forced entry. A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom. The area <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained. A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At the foot of the stairs, two cups and saucers lay in a pool of blood. Rivett's arm protruded from the canvas sack, which lay in a slowly expanding pool of blood. The light fitting at the bottom of the stairs was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves in the adjoining rear garden.|$|E

5|$|One {{factor was}} the {{introduction}} of stone into castle building. The earliest stone castles had emerged in the 10th century, with stone keeps being built on mottes along the Catalonia frontier and several, including Château de Langeais, in Angers. Although wood was a more powerful defensive material than was once thought, stone became increasingly popular for military and symbolic reasons. Some existing motte-and-bailey castles were converted to stone, with the keep and the gatehouse usually the first parts to be upgraded. Shell keeps were built on many mottes, circular stone shells running <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the motte, sometime protected by a further chemise, or low protective wall, around the base. By the 14th century, a number of motte and bailey castles had been converted into powerful stone fortresses.|$|E

25|$|Locally sourced {{iron ore}} has been {{processed}} on the North York Moors from medieval times. In the 19th century {{it became a}} boom industry. Dozens of ironstone mines and several short-lived blast furnaces were constructed. Between 1856 and 1926 high-grade magnetic ironstone was mined in Rosedale. A railway was built <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the dale to serve the mines, and kilns were built to process the ore. In two decades {{the population of the}} valley rose from 558 to nearly 3000. Poor-quality coal was mined in many places on the moors from the 18th century to the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The Duveen Gallery, sited to {{the west}} of the Egyptian, Greek & Assyrian {{sculpture}} galleries, was designed to house the Elgin Marbles by the American Beaux-Arts architect John Russell Pope. Although completed in 1938, it was hit by a bomb in 1940 and remained semi-derelict for 22 years, before reopening in 1962. Other areas damaged during World War II bombing included: in September 1940 two unexploded bombs hit the Edward VII galleries, the King's Library received a direct hit from a high explosive bomb, incendiaries fell on the dome of the Round Reading Room but did little damage; on the night of 10 to 11 May 1941 several incendiaries fell on the south west corner of the Museum, destroying the book stack and 150,000 books in the courtyard and the galleries <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the Great Staircase – this damage was not fully repaired until the early 1960s.|$|E

25|$|The crest {{was changed}} in 1970 to a minimalist version {{designed}} by a local art student, and this logo {{was used by the}} club, with variations, until 1995, when it was replaced by a similar design to the original crest. It again featured a traditionally drawn owl perched on a branch although the design of both had changed. The sheaves were replaced by a stylised SWFC logo that had been in use on club merchandise for several years prior to the introduction of the new crest. The Yorkshire Rose was moved to above the owl's head {{to make way for the}} words Sheffield Wednesday. The word Hillsborough was also curved <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the design.

25|$|On 6 December 2011, Kuznetsov and escorting ships {{departed}} its Northern Fleet homebase for the Mediterranean deployment {{to exercise}} with ships from the Russian Baltic and Black Sea Fleets. On 12 December 2011 Kuznetsov and its escorts, were spotted northeast of Orkney {{off the coast}} of northern Scotland, the first such time she had deployed near the UK. HMS York shadowed the group for a week; due to severe weather, the group took shelter in international waters in the Moray Firth, some 30 miles from the UK coast. The Kuznetsov then sailed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> Scotland and into the Atlantic past western Ireland, where it conducted flight operations with her Sukhoi Su-33 Flanker jets and Kamov Ka-27 helicopters in international airspace. On 8 January 2012, Kuznetsov anchored near shore outside Tartus while other ships in its escort entered the port to use the leased Russian naval support facility to replenish their supplies, after which all ships continued their deployment on 9 January. On 17 February 2012, Kuznetsov returned to its homebase of Severomorsk.|$|E
25|$|On 22 January, Japanese {{artillery}} began {{firing on}} the 2/12th's position, {{but it was}} unable {{to prevent them from}} taking Prothero II. Meanwhile, a small patrol from the 2/2nd Pioneers began exploiting the area to the north-east of Prothero II and subsequently managed to install itself in a position on the eastern extremity of Kankiryo Saddle. To the south, the 2/9th carried out reconnaissance around the area in front of their position around Green Sniper's Pimple, and located several Japanese bunkers. Deciding on an indirect approach, an Australian patrol was sent to the flanks and under the cover of heavy artillery, they scaled the steep sides of McCaughey's Knoll to take the position with the element of surprise. Earlier, the 2/10th had taken several attempts to secure Cam's Hill, including an unsuccessful assault on the Japanese rear with a flanking move through the Faria River. Throughout the night, the Japanese launched several unsuccessful counter-attack attempts, but these were repelled and on 24 January, the 2/9th and 2/12th Infantry Battalions continued to converge, squeezing the Japanese defenders between them. As a result, the Japanese were forced to abandon positions <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the Faria River and the Kankiryo Saddle and they began to withdraw to Crater Hill. The following day, patrols from the 2/10th and 2/12th Infantry Battalions determined that the Japanese were digging in on that position, and throughout the day the 2/9th attempted to outflank the position, attacking from behind while the 2/10th and 2/12th assaulted frontally from the south. These proved unsuccessful and during 26 January, the 2/9th sent two companies across Kankiryo Saddle, securing the 4100 feature before coming under heavy fire from the Japanese on Crater Hill, where they had dug-in strong defences along several sharp ridges.|$|E

25|$|Before {{her next}} voyage, a {{virtually}} new crew had been signed on - {{of the crew}} of 47, only eight men {{had been on the}} previous voyage. This eight included Captain Grimstone and his three deck officers, the mate John Elliot, William Hickson the gun layer, two other gunners and the ship steward. On Friday 24 October, in the early afternoon the English Trader left the Thames for what would be her last voyage. By late afternoon she had reached Southend on Sea. Here the Thames estuary was wide enough for convoys to form up in relative safety. Convoy EC90 was made up of 20 ocean-going freighters, two or three coastal steamers and two Royal Navy destroyers, one of which was the ageing HMS Vesper. Convoy EC90 set off on its voyage in single file to start with, proceeding at a steady eight knots. For the English Trader this was close to her maximum speed with a crew who knew how to get the best from her, which the new crew did not. The convoy's route took it up the east coast of England and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> Scotland and down into the Atlantic Ocean. The English Channel was far too hazardous for shipping convoys {{at this stage of the}} war. By 3 pm, the English Trader's troubles had begun. She had been running sluggishly, which had been noticed by the crew members from previous voyages. She was now a least a half a mile behind the bulk of the convoy and HMS Vesper was enquiring for the reasons for the poor speed of the ship. The speculation from the more experienced crew members was that the English Traders coal-fired boilers, which were forced draught fed, required the booster fans to be precisely set. It was agreed that the ill-experienced new crew and the new chief engineer were unable to accomplish this. The captain was told by the commodore aboard the Vesper that if she could not regain her position in the convoy by nightfall she should make for harbour at one of the east coast ports.|$|E

Each sponson, one above the gun ports and one on each side of the turret, mounted a light gun, probably a [...] Engstrem gun, for defense against torpedo boats. A fourth gun was mounted on a platform aft of the funnel when a hurricane deck was built between the funnel and the turret, also probably during the 1870s.|$|E
40|$|Examination of radar records {{shows that}} snow trails {{frequently}} occur <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> showers. Evidence {{has been sought}} that showers can be initiated by snow trails. Cumulus clouds with <b>tops</b> above <b>the</b> freezing level often fail to precipitate. Theoretical studies show that snow trails could act as seeding agents for cumulus clouds, entrainment providing the mechanism whereby snow enters a cloud. Certain observed radar patterns suggest strongly that showers were produced in this manner. As a check, polar diagrams {{can be used to}} organize observations made on different bearings. Those constructed show showers occurring in regions of snow trails more frequently than elsewhere. This is further evidence that snow can act as a seeding agent in cumulus clouds...|$|R
