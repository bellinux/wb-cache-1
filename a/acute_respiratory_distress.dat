5|$|Icos {{developed}} several drugs {{whose purpose}} was to disrupt the process of inflammation in the body. The research program focused on {{the underlying causes of}} inflammation rather than specific disorders. The compounds developed by Icos were tested in clinical trials in the areas of sepsis, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, heart attack, pancreatitis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial cystitis, psoriasis, hemorrhagic shock, sexual dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>distress</b> syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{has several}} serious complications. Among {{these is the}} {{development}} of respiratory distress, which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe P.falciparum malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis, noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, concomitant pneumonia, and severe anaemia. Although rare in young children with severe malaria, <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>distress</b> syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women. Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality. Renal failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{strains of}} influenza, H1N1 does not disproportionately infect adults older than 60years; {{this was an}} unusual and {{characteristic}} feature of the H1N1 pandemic. Even {{in the case of}} previously very healthy people, a small percentage will develop pneumonia or <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>distress</b> syndrome (ARDS). This manifests itself as increased breathing difficulty and typically occurs 3–6 days after initial onset of flu symptoms. The pneumonia caused by flu can be either direct viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia. In fact, a November 2009 New England Journal of Medicine article recommends that flu patients whose chest X-ray indicates pneumonia receive both antivirals and antibiotics.|$|E

40|$|Sixty infants (median {{gestational age}} 29 weeks) with acute and 60 infants (median gestational age 25 weeks) with chronic <b>respiratory</b> <b>distress</b> were {{randomised}} to be extubated either {{directly into a}} headbox or onto 3 cm H 2 O nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Our aim was {{to test the hypothesis}} that extubation onto nasal CPAP rather than directly into a headbox was more likely to be associated with successful extubation in infants with acute rather than chronic <b>respiratory</b> <b>distress.</b> Overall the failure rate of extubation was approximately 33 %, with {{no significant difference between the}} infants with <b>acute</b> and chronic <b>respiratory</b> <b>distress.</b> There was no significant difference in the failure rate of extubation among infants randomised to receive nasal CPAP or headbox oxygen in either the <b>acute</b> or chronic <b>respiratory</b> <b>distress</b> groups...|$|R
5|$|Intubation may be {{necessary}} for a patient with decreased oxygen content and oxygen saturation of the blood caused when their breathing is inadequate (hypoventilation), suspended (apnea), or when the lungs are unable to sufficiently transfer gasses to the blood. Such patients, who may be awake and alert, are typically critically ill with a multisystem disease or multiple severe injuries. Examples of such conditions include cervical spine injury, multiple rib fractures, severe pneumonia, <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>distress</b> syndrome (ARDS), or near-drowning. Specifically, intubation is considered if the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is less than 60millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) while breathing an inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) of 50% or greater. In patients with elevated arterial carbon dioxide, an arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) greater than 45mm Hg {{in the setting of}} acidemia would prompt intubation, especially if a series of measurements demonstrate a worsening respiratory acidosis. Regardless of the laboratory values, these guidelines are always interpreted in the clinical context.|$|E
5|$|Pafase, {{also known}} as rPAF-AH, was {{developed}} to treat severe sepsis. Pafase is the recombinant form of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH, {{also known as}} lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2), an enzyme made naturally by macrophages and found in human blood. PAF-AH inactivates platelet-activating factor, a phospholipid that {{plays a role in}} the inflammation seen in sepsis. The enzyme was discovered in the mid-1980s by graduate student Diana Stafforini and researchers Steve Prescott, Guy Zimmerman, and Tom McIntyre at the University of Utah. The gene that codes for Pafase was discovered by Icos. Early trials for sepsis showed that the drug reduced the death rate after 28days and patients were less likely to develop severe respiratory problems. Icos also tested Pafase for <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>distress</b> syndrome (ARDS). In phaseII trials for ARDS, Pafase reduced the death rate after 28days and reduced the chance that the lungs of the patient would fail. However, Icos halted development in December2002 when interim data from phaseIII trials for sepsis showed that the drug did not help patients survive. Scientists at Northwestern University later studied Pafase for necrotizing enterocolitis, and there is ongoing research on the enzyme for atherosclerosis at the University of Utah.|$|E

25|$|Barotrauma is a {{recognised}} {{complication of}} mechanical ventilation {{that can occur}} in any patient receiving mechanical ventilation, but is most commonly associated with <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>distress</b> syndrome. It {{used to be the}} most common complication of mechanical ventilation but can usually be avoided by limiting tidal volume and plateau pressure to less than 30 to 50cm water column (30 to 50mb). As an indicator of transalveolar pressure, which predicts alveolar distention, plateau pressure or peak airway pressure (PAP) may be the most effective predictor of risk, but there is no generally accepted safe pressure at which there is no risk. Risk also appears to be increased by aspiration of stomach contents and pre-existing disease such as necrotising pneumonia and chronic lung disease. Status asthmaticus is a particular problem as it requires relatively high pressures to overcome bronchial obstruction.|$|E
25|$|Clinically, {{the most}} serious and {{immediate}} complication is <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>distress</b> syndrome (ARDS), which usually occurs within 24 h. Those with significant lower airway involvement may develop bacterial infection. Importantly, victims suffering body surface burn and smoke inhalation are the most susceptible. Thermal injury combined with inhalation injury compromises pulmonary function, producing microvascular hyperpermeability {{that leads to a}} significant increase in lung lymph flow and pulmonary edema. The terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 left many people with impaired lung function. A study of firefighters and EMS workers enrolled in the FDNY WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program, whose lung function was tested prior to 9/11, documented a steep decline in lung function in the first year after 9/11. A new study that includes a thousand additional workers shows that the declines have persisted over time. Prior to 9/11, 3% of firefighters had below-normal lung function, one year after 9/11 nearly 19% did, and six years later it stabilized at 13%. Ten to 14 days after acute exposure to some agents (e.g. ammonia, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury), some patients develop bronchiolitis obliterans progressing to ARDS. Bronchiolitis obliterans with organized pneumonia can ensue when granulation tissue accumulates in the terminal airways and alveolar ducts during the body's reparative process. A minority of these patients develop late pulmonary fibrosis. Also at enhanced risk are persons with co-morbidities. Several studies report that both aged persons and smokers are especially vulnerable to the adverse effects of inhalation injury.|$|E

40|$|The {{selection}} {{of patients with}} <b>acute</b> lung injury/acute <b>respiratory</b> <b>distress</b> syndrome (ALI/ARDS) to receive noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is challenging, partly because there are few reliable selection criteria. The study by Rana and colleagues in the previous issue of Critical Care identifies metabolic acidosis and a lower oxygenation index as predictors of NIV failure, although it is unable to identify threshold values. It also demonstrates that treating patients with NIV for ALI/ARDS and shock {{is an exercise in}} futility. Future studies need to focus on criteria that will enable {{selection of}} patients for whom NIV will have a high likelihood of success. Although noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has been used to treat <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> failure for well over a decade, our knowledge on how best to apply it continues to evolve. Relatively little debate surrounds its use for <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> failure due to exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [1], cardiogenic pulmonary edema [2] or in immunocompromised hosts [3]. However, its appropriate use to treat hypoxemic respiratory failure, particularly patients with <b>acute</b> lung injury/acute <b>respiratory</b> <b>distress</b> syndrome (ALI/ARDS), remains unclear. In the previous issue of Critical Care, Rana and colleagues [4] examine this application of NIV and identify risk factors for failure. Rana and colleagues [4] evaluated the outcomes of an observational cohort of patients with ALI treated with NIV as the initial mode of therapy. Of a total of 358 patients started on NIV at one hospital over a 6 month period, 79 were identified as having ALI as defined by bilateral chest infiltrates,...|$|R
