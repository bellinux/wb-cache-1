5|$|Soft tissue {{injuries}} {{are one of}} the most common types of injuries found within aikido, as well as joint strain and stubbed fingers <b>and</b> <b>toes.</b> Several deaths from head-and-neck injuries, caused by aggressive shihōnage in a senpai/kōhai hazing context, have been reported.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} birdlice are {{present on the}} birds and in their nests, and mites of the genus Knemidocoptes {{have been known to}} infest populations, {{resulting}} in lesions on the legs <b>and</b> <b>toes.</b> Parasitisation of nestlings by Protocalliphora blow-fly larvae is a significant factor in nestling mortality. Egg size does not influence nestling mortality, but chicks from large eggs grow faster.|$|E
5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{a disorder}} {{that results in}} pain in the heel {{and bottom of the}} foot. The pain is usually most severe with the first steps of the day or following a period of rest. Pain is also frequently brought on by bending the foot <b>and</b> <b>toes</b> up towards the shin and may be worsened by a tight Achilles tendon. The condition typically comes on slowly. In about a third of people both legs are affected.|$|E
50|$|The {{longitudinal}} {{location of}} the cross beam controls important parameters of the suspension's behaviour, such as the roll steer curve <b>and</b> <b>toe</b> <b>and</b> camber compliance. The closer the cross beam to the axle stubs the more the camber <b>and</b> <b>toe</b> changes under deflection. A key difference between the camber <b>and</b> <b>toe</b> changes of a twist beam vs independent suspension is the change in camber <b>and</b> <b>toe</b> {{is dependent on the}} position of the other wheel, not the car's chassis. In a traditional independent suspension the camber <b>and</b> <b>toe</b> are based on the position of the wheel relative to the body. If both wheels compress together their camber <b>and</b> <b>toe</b> will not change. Thus if both wheels started perpendicular to the road and car compressed together they will stay perpendicular to the road. The camber <b>and</b> <b>toe</b> changes are the result of one wheel being compressed relative to the other.|$|R

5|$|Their feet {{have four}} long toes and an opposable big toe. Orangutans can grasp things with both {{their hands and}} their feet. Their fingers <b>and</b> <b>toes</b> are curved, {{allowing}} them {{to get a better}} grip on branches. Since their hip joints have the same flexibility as their shoulder and arm joints, orangutans have less restriction in the movements of their legs than humans have. Unlike gorillas and chimpanzees, orangutans are not true knuckle-walkers, and are instead fist-walkers.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study by}} Dr. Nguyen Viet Nhan, {{children}} in the areas where Agent Orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems, including cleft palate, mental disabilities, hernias, and extra fingers <b>and</b> <b>toes.</b> In the 1970s, high levels of dioxin were found in the breast milk of South Vietnamese women, and in the blood of U.S. military personnel who had served in Vietnam. The most affected zones are the mountainous area along Truong Son (Long Mountains) and the border between Vietnam and Cambodia. The affected residents are living in substandard conditions with many genetic diseases.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{it appears}} that Iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier; {{juvenile}} I. bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults (60% of hindlimb length versus 70% for adults). When walking as a quadruped, the animal's hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other, as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus's arms and hands. The three toed pes (foot) of Iguanodon was relatively long, and when walking, both the hand and the foot would {{have been used in}} a digitigrade fashion (walking on the fingers <b>and</b> <b>toes).</b> The maximum speed of Iguanodon has been estimated at , which would have been as a biped; {{it would not have been}} able to gallop as a quadruped.|$|E

5|$|Several {{anomalies}} {{affecting the}} digits (fingers <b>and</b> <b>toes)</b> {{have been observed}} with the syndrome. A broadening of the thumbs and big toes (halluces) was reported in two brothers. The broadening was apparent in all distal phalanges of the fingers, although the pinkies were unaffected yet appeared to be clinodactylic (warped, or bent toward the other fingers). Additional eports described this broadness of the thumbs and big toes, with brachydactyly (shortness) in the distal phalanges of the other digits except the pinkies in affected individuals. On X-rays of a two-year-old boy with the disorder, the brachydactyly was shown {{to be caused by}} shortening of epiphyses (joint-ends) of the distal phalanges. The broadness and brachydactyly of the big toes in particular may give them a stunted, rounded and stub-like appearance.|$|E
5|$|When {{warfarin}} (or another 4-hydroxycoumarin derivative) {{is given}} {{during the first}} trimester—particularly between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancy—a constellation of birth defects known variously as fetal warfarin syndrome (FWS), warfarin embryopathy, or coumarin embryopathy can occur. FWS is characterized mainly by skeletal abnormalities, which include nasal hypoplasia, a depressed or narrowed nasal bridge, scoliosis, and calcifications in the vertebral column, femur, and heel bone, which show a peculiar stippled appearance on X-rays. Limb abnormalities, such as brachydactyly (unusually short fingers <b>and</b> <b>toes)</b> or underdeveloped extremities, can also occur. Common nonskeletal features of FWS include low birth weight and developmental disabilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} hunts by flying slowly, {{quartering}} {{the ground and}} hovering over spots that may conceal prey. It may also use branches, fence posts or other lookouts to scan its surroundings, {{and this is the}} main means of prey location in the oil palm plantations of Malaysia. The bird has long, broad wings, enabling it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly. Its legs <b>and</b> <b>toes</b> are long and slender which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath the snow and gives it a wide spread of talons when attacking prey. Studies have shown that an individual barn owl may eat one or more voles (or their equivalent) per night, equivalent to about twenty-three percent of the bird's bodyweight. Excess food is often cached at roosting sites and can be used when food is scarce.|$|E

5|$|The small, rounded {{ears are}} covered with dense golden hairs on the outer and with reddish brown hairs on the inner surface. The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers on the upper lip) are long, usually {{extending}} a little beyond the ears when laid back against the head, but the superciliary vibrissae (whiskers above the eyes) are short and do not extend beyond the ears. The upper surface on the forefeet is covered with brown fur, and there is white or silvery fur on the digits. Ungual tufts (fur around the bases of the claws) are present on the second through fourth digits. On the short, fairly broad hindfeet, the upper side is covered densely with silvery to white hairs near {{the tips of the}} feet <b>and</b> <b>toes,</b> and with brown fur otherwise. No other oryzomyine has such brown fur on its hindfeet. The second through fourth digits have long silvery-white ungual tufts, but those on the first digit are short. On the sole, the pads are very large. Among oryzomyines, only Oecomys and the extinct Megalomys have similarly large pads between their digits. There is a dense cover of short brown hairs on both the upper and lower sides of the tail. Unlike in Eremoryzomys, the tail is the same color above and below. The tail ends in a tuft, an unusual feature among oryzomyines.|$|E
25|$|Children often face medical issues very {{different}} from the experiences of an adult patient. Many birth defects or syndromes present at birth are best treated in childhood, and pediatric plastic surgeons specialize in treating these conditions in children. Conditions commonly treated by pediatric plastic surgeons include craniofacial anomalies, Syndactyly (webbing of the fingers <b>and</b> <b>toes),</b> Polydactyly (excess fingers <b>and</b> <b>toes</b> at birth), cleft lip and palate, and congenital hand deformities.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} {{safe to use}} lidocaine with vasoconstrictor such as epinephrine including in regions such as the nose, ears, fingers <b>and</b> <b>toes.</b> While concerns of tissue death if used in these areas have been raised evidence does not support these concerns.|$|E
