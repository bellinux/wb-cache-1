5|$|The SCN {{projects}} {{to a set}} of areas in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep-wake cycles. <b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system is the reticular formation, a group of neuron-clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain. Reticular neurons send signals to the thalamus, which in turn sends activity-level-controlling signals to every part of the cortex. Damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma.|$|E

5|$|The {{vestibulocochlear nerve}} (VIII) splits into the {{vestibular}} and cochlear nerve. The vestibular part {{is responsible for}} innervating the vestibules and semicircular canal of the inner ear; this structure transmits information about balance, and is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vestibuloocular reflex, which keeps the head stable and allows the eyes to track moving objects. The cochlear nerve transmits information from the cochlea, allowing sound to be heard.|$|E
5|$|In C++ {{computer}} programming, allocators are <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C++ Standard Library. The standard library provides several data structures, such as {{list and}} set, {{commonly referred to}} as containers. A common trait among these containers is their ability to change size during the execution of the program. To achieve this, some form of dynamic memory allocation is usually required. Allocators handle all the requests for allocation and deallocation of memory for a given container. The C++ Standard Library provides general-purpose allocators that are used by default, however, custom allocators may also be supplied by the programmer.|$|E
5|$|In music, {{noise is}} {{variously}} described as unpitched, indeterminate, uncontrolled, loud, unmusical, or unwanted sound. Noise is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{sound of the}} human voice and all musical instruments, particularly in unpitched percussion instruments and electric guitars (using distortion). Electronic instruments create various colours of noise. Traditional uses of noise are unrestricted, using all the frequencies associated with pitch and timbre, such as the white noise component of a drum roll on a snare drum, or the transients present in the prefix of the sounds of some organ pipes.|$|E

5|$|The common {{element to}} both church and palazzi {{interior}} design was the stucco work. Stucco is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baroque design and philosophy, as it seamlessly combines architecture, sculpture, and painting in three-dimensional form. Its combination with trompe l'oeil ceilings and walls in Baroque illusionistic painting confuses reality and art. While in churches the stucco could represent angels and putti linked by swags of flowers, {{in a private}} house it might represent the owner's favourite foods or musical instruments.|$|E
5|$|Valued for its meat, the finetooth shark forms <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{commercial}} gillnet shark fishery operating off {{the southeastern}} United States. Population assessments {{suggest that this}} fishery does not currently {{pose a threat to}} U.S. populations of the species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has therefore listed the finetooth shark under Least Concern, though no fishery data are available for this species off South America. This shark is not known to pose a danger to humans, though it snaps vigorously when captured and should be handled with caution.|$|E
5|$|Boston's harbor {{activity}} was significantly curtailed by the Embargo Act of 1807 (adopted during the Napoleonic Wars) and the War of 1812. Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital {{investments in the}} interim. Manufacturing became <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's economy, and the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century. Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers until the early 20th century, and was notable for its garment production and leather-goods industries. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods {{and led to a}} proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce.|$|E

5|$|As America's {{involvement}} in World War II intensified, Motley joined the U.S. Navy in 1944 {{and was sent}} to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. There he played for the Great Lakes Navy Bluejackets, a military team coached by Paul Brown, who was serving in the Navy during an extended leave from his job as head coach of The Ohio State University's football team. Motley played fullback and linebacker at Great Lakes, and was <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team's offense and defense. The highlight of his time at Great Lakes was a 39–7 victory over Notre Dame in 1945. Motley was eligible for discharge before the game – it was the final match of the season and the last military game of World War II – but he stayed on to play. Motley put up an impressive performance, thanks in part to Brown's experimentation with a new play: a delayed handoff later called the draw play.|$|E
5|$|The major British {{assault of}} the first day was {{directly}} east of Arras, with the 12th Division attacking Observation Ridge, north of the Arras—Cambrai road. After reaching this objective, they were to push on towards Feuchy, as well as the second and third lines of German trenches. At the same time, elements of the 3rd Division began an assault south of the road, with the taking of Devil's Wood, Tilloy-lès-Mofflaines and the Bois des Boeufs as their initial objectives. The ultimate objective of these assaults was the Monchyriegel, a trench running between Wancourt and Feuchy and <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German defences. Most of these objectives, including Feuchy village, had been achieved by the evening of 10 April though the Germans were still in control of large sections of the trenches between Wancourt and Feuchy, particularly {{in the area of the}} heavily fortified village of Neuville-Vitasse. The following day, troops from the 56th Division were able to force the Germans out of the village, although the Monchyriegel was not fully in British hands until a few days later. The British were able to consolidate these gains and push forward towards Monchy-le-Preux, although they suffered heavy casualties in fighting near the village.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bretton Woods {{agreements}} was {{the creation}} of two new international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and technical assistance to members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. Members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product, from which emergency loans could be issued. Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages. While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects. The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone {{in the evolution of the}} international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following World War II. Since the establishment of the International Development Association (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the World Bank. While the IBRD lends to middle-income developing countries, the IDA extends the Bank's lending program by offering concessional loans and grants to the world's poorest nations.|$|E

5|$|The {{collection}} of shellfish, especially oysters, is another traditional activity which still {{takes place in}} Casamance, {{which is one of}} three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with Petite Côte and Sine-Saloum. Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Oysters are <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family diet. Rich in dietary minerals and vitamin C, they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. Oysters are readily associated with rice, the staple food, and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce. Those destined for sale or preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market. Oysters are also a source of income, and Carabane is located {{in the center of the}} collection zone, which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by hawkers.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversial}} 1905 {{partition of}} Bengal had a widespread political impact. Acting as a stimulus for radical nationalist opinion in India and abroad, {{it became a}} focal issue for Indian revolutionaries. Revolutionary organisations like Jugantar and Anushilan Samiti had emerged in the 20th century. Several significant events took place. These included assassinations and attempted assassinations of civil servants, prominent public figures and Indian informants, including one in 1907 aiming to kill the Bengal Lieutenant-Governor Sir Andrew Fraser. Matters {{came to a head}} when the 1912 Delhi–Lahore Conspiracy, led by erstwhile Jugantar member Rash Behari Bose, attempted to assassinate the then Viceroy of India, Charles Hardinge. In the aftermath of this event, the British Indian police made concentrated police and intelligence efforts to destroy the Bengali and Punjabi revolutionary underground. Though the movement came under intense pressure for some time, Rash Behari successfully evaded capture for nearly three years. By the time World War I had begun in Europe in 1914, the revolutionary movement had revived in Punjab and Bengal. In Bengal the movement, with a safe haven in the French base of Chandernagore, had sufficient strength to all but paralyse the state administration. The earliest mention of a conspiracy for armed revolution in India appears in Nixon's Report on Revolutionary Organisation, which reported that Jatin Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin) and Naren Bhattacharya had met the Crown Prince of Germany during the latter's visit to Calcutta in 1912, and obtained an assurance that they would receive supplies of arms and ammunition. At the same time an increasingly strong pan-Islamic movement started developing, mainly in the north and north-west regions of India. With the onset of the war in 1914, the members of this movement formed <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|The nectar of B.sessilis is <b>an</b> <b>{{important}}</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diet of {{a number}} of species of honeyeater. In one study, B.sessilis was found to be the main source of nectar for all six species studied, namely the tawny-crowned honeyeater (Gliciphila melanops), white-cheeked honeyeater (Phylidonyris niger), western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus), brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta), brown-headed honeyeater (Melithreptus brevirostris), and black honeyeater (Certhionyx niger). Moreover, B.sessilis {{played an important role in}} their distributions, with species that feed only on nectar occurring only where B.sessilis occurs, and remaining for longest at sites where B.sessilis is most abundant. Other honeyeaters that have been recorded feeding on B.sessilis include the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), western wattlebird (A.lunulata), and New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae). Furthermore, a study of bird species diversity in wandoo woodland around Bakers Hill found that honeyeater species and numbers were much reduced in forest that lacked a Banksia sessilis understory; the plant is a key source of nectar and insects during the winter months. A field study in jarrah forest 9km south of Jarrahdale, where B. sessilis grows in scattered clumps, found that western wattlebirds and New Holland honeyeaters sought out groups of plants with the greatest numbers of new inflorescences, particularly those one or two days after anthesis, where nectar yield was highest. The birds likely recognises these by visual clues.|$|E

5|$|To {{bring these}} areas to life, the level {{designers}} produced game mechanic elements using simple room layouts and shapes, while concept artists worked in tandem to create artwork for each location, following the art direction. Environment artists would then build 3D layouts {{based on those}} designs. Finding an appropriate color palette for the game world was difficult; browns and monochromatic colors could depict the desired dark and moody atmosphere, but the developers wanted the aesthetic to resemble the vibrant color schemes of a comic book. To this end, they used saturated colors for in-game lighting. Lighting was <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, being used to highlight points of interest and to draw the player onward in otherwise boring corridors. To maintain the intended level of detail and allow the game's console versions {{to fit into the}} devices' memory, each area had to be streamed in and out of memory seamlessly to free up memory for textures and geometry. All of the cutscenes were storyboarded by Rocksteady artists, being visualized in the game engine before the character performances were motion-captured. The design team decided that cutscenes should be used to advance character relationships, and that after each cutscene the player should have had their goal changed or the importance of their actions modified. Priority was given to keeping action scenes under the player's control rather than showing them in cutscenes.|$|E
