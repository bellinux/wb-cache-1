5|$|Individuals with {{breathing}} difficulties due to asthma or allergies may experience additional barriers to quality sleep {{that can be}} <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> specific variations of sleep hygiene recommendations. Difficulty with breathing can cause disruptions to sleep, reducing the ability to stay asleep and to achieve restful sleep. For individuals with allergies or asthma, additional considerations {{must be given to}} potential triggers in the bedroom environment. Medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair sleep in other ways, so there must be careful management of decongestants, asthma controllers, and antihistamines.|$|E
5|$|Kamadhenu {{is often}} <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> the proper name Surabhi or Shurbhi, {{which is also}} used as a synonym for an {{ordinary}} cow. Professor Jacobi considers the name Surabhi—"the fragrant one"—to have originated from the peculiar smell of cows. According to the Monier Williams Sanskrit–English Dictionary (1899), Surabhi means fragrant, charming, pleasing, as well as cow and earth. It can specifically refer to the divine cow Kamadhenu, the mother of cattle who is also sometimes described as a Matrika ("mother") goddess. Other proper names attributed to Kamadhenu are Sabala ("the spotted one") and Kapila ("the red one").|$|E

5|$|Shallow penetration, another {{detriment}} to weld strength, can be <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> decreasing welding speed, {{increasing the}} current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects {{can make the}} weld prone to cracking, but other factors are involved as well. High carbon, alloy or sulfur content in the base material can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, the workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools and contracts.|$|E
