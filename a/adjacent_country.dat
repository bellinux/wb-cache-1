5|$|Steep {{contacts}} between the thick basal breccia of Mount Silverthrone and older crystalline rocks of adjacent peaks {{suggest that the}} breccia {{is part of a}} caldera-fill succession. The presence of irregular subvolcanic intrusions and a profusion of dikes within the breccia—but not in <b>adjacent</b> <b>country</b> rock—provide further evidence of the Silverthrone Caldera. Potassium-argon dates of 750,000 and 400,000 years on rhyolitic lava domes above the basal breccia are consistent with the high rates of uplift and erosion recorded elsewhere in the Coast Mountains.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1644, the Parliamentarians, having met with so many reverses in {{trying to take the}} place by storm, set {{themselves}} to the task of starving the garrison out, and for this purpose strong bodies of their troops were quartered at Farnham, Odiham, Greywell, and Basingstoke, who patrolled the <b>adjacent</b> <b>country</b> to prevent the taking in of provisions.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan's {{foreign office}} {{spokesman}} had confirmed {{that there was}} a heavy influx of foreigners aiding the Taliban and that weapons were coming from the <b>adjacent</b> <b>country</b> of Afghanistan. Many Pakistani defence analysts and experts had publicly accused India and Afghanistan of aiding the Taliban to destabilize Pakistan. On May 19, 2009, the Pakistan Army captured three foreign fighters from Mingora District. According to the Pakistani Army, all these foreign fighters were Libyan nationals. The Pakistani Army also captured five Saudi nationals during the search operation.|$|E

500|$|Pettigrew had {{the head}} {{examined}} by a phrenologist. Examination was considered {{difficult because of}} the large fracture across {{the back of the head}} caused by the gunshot.

60|$|To be {{nearer to}} San Domingo, and obtain more correct information, he {{proceeded}} to Bonao, which was now beginning to assume {{the appearance of a}} settlement, several Spaniards having erected houses there, and cultivated the <b>adjacent</b> <b>country.</b> He had scarcely reached the place, when an alcalde, bearing a staff of office, arrived there from San Domingo, proclaiming the appointment of Bobadilla to the government, and bearing copies of his letters patent. There was no especial letter or message sent to the admiral, nor were any of the common forms of courtesy and ceremony observed in superseding him in the command; all the proceedings of Bobadilla towards him were abrupt and insulting.|$|E

Their sudden liking to each other seemed strange, considering the great difference in their dispositions; but about the fact there was no mistake, they were constantly absent together on long drives and walks, exploring the <b>adjacent</b> <b>country,</b> lunching at distant rural villages, and coming home to dinner glowing with health and happy as young lovers.|$|E

60|$|At {{last the}} guns and the thunder dropped off; the sun shone on the wet meadows; the air was scented with the breath of rejoicing trees and grass; and the river kept unweariedly {{carrying}} us on at its best pace. There was a manufacturing district about Chauny, and after that the banks grew so high that they hid the <b>adjacent</b> <b>country,</b> and we could see nothing but clay sides, and one willow after another. Only, here and there, we passed by a village or a ferry, and some wondering child upon the bank would stare after us until we turned the corner.
