5|$|On 9June 2004, the day <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> a 21st-century pair of Venus transits {{occurred}} as predicted by Horrocks, a commemorative street nameplate {{in memory of}} William Crabtree was unveiled at the junction of Lower Broughton Road and Priory Grove, which marks the northern boundary of Crabtree Croft. In December 2005, a commemorative plaque was unveiled {{a few yards away}} near Ivy Cottage on Lower Broughton Road, which is thought to have been the home of Crabtree and his family {{at the time he was}} collaborating with Horrocks. The second transit of the pair occurred on 5 and 6June 2012, and was marked by a celebration held in the church at Much Hoole, which was streamed live worldwide on the NASA website. A celebration was also held at Crabtree's former home in Broughton when NASA broadcast a re-creation of the observation at Ivy Cottage, inspired by the Ford Madox Brown mural, to millions of viewers, and projected a live video stream of the transit from Hawaii onto the side of the house.|$|E
5|$|StarCraft begins {{just days}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> these attacks, where the {{predominant}} Terran government, the Confederacy of Man, {{falls into a}} state of panic as it comes under attack by both the Zerg and the Protoss, in addition to increasing rebel activity led by Arcturus Mengsk against its rule. The Confederacy eventually succumbs to Mengsk's rebels when they use Confederate technology to lure the Zerg into attacking the Confederate capital, Tarsonis. In the consequent power vacuum, Mengsk crowns himself emperor of a new Terran Dominion. During the assault on Tarsonis, Mengsk allows the Zerg to capture and infest his psychic second-in-command, Sarah Kerrigan. This betrayal prompts Mengsk's other commander, Jim Raynor, to desert him with a small army. Having retreated with Kerrigan to their primary hive clusters, the Zerg are assaulted by Protoss forces commanded by Tassadar and the dark templar Zeratul. Through assassinating a Zerg cerebrate, Zeratul inadvertently allows the Overmind to learn the location of the Protoss homeworld, Aiur. The Overmind quickly launches an invasion to assimilate the Protoss and gain genetic perfection. Pursued by his own people as a heretic for siding with the dark templar, Tassadar returns with Zeratul to Aiur and with the assistance of Raynor and the templar Fenix, Tassadar launches an attack on the Overmind and ultimately sacrifices himself to kill the creature.|$|E

He {{then went on to}} burn the settlement and the restant structures of an earlier one on Sainte-Croix (now in Maine) and the occupied site of Port Royal (now in Nova Scotia). One of his principle French captives later wrote in praise of Argall's character and conduct. Argall was also the first Englishman to visit Manhattan where he landed and warned the Dutch of their encroachment upon English territory.|$|E

25|$|By 23 April, some of Chuikov's rifle units {{had crossed}} the Spree and Dahme rivers south of Köpenick and by 24 April were {{advancing}} towards Britz and Neukölln. Accompanying them were the leading tanks of Colonel-General Mikhail Katukov's 1st Guards Tank Army. Sometime after midnight, a corps of Colonel-General Nikolai Berzarin's 5th Shock Army crossed the Spree close to Treptow Park. At dawn on 24 April the LVI Panzer Corps still under Weidling's direct command, counterattacked, but were severely mauled by the 5th Shock Army, which was able to continue its advance around mid-day. Meanwhile, the first large Soviet probe into the city was put into operation. Katukov's 1st Guards Tank Army attacked across the Teltow Canal. At 06:20 a bombardment by 3,000 guns and heavy mortars began (a staggering 650 pieces of artillery per kilometer of front). At 07:00 hours the first Soviet battalions were across, {{to be followed by}} tanks around 12:00, shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> the pontoon bridges were completed. By the evening Treptow Park was in Soviet hands and they had also reached the S-Bahn.|$|E
25|$|Also In the North, the 10th Special Forces Group (10th SFG) and CIA {{paramilitary}} {{officers from}} their Special Activities Division had {{the mission of}} aiding the Kurdish parties, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party, de facto rulers of Iraqi Kurdistan since 1991, and employing them against the 13 Iraqi Divisions located near Kirkuk and Mosul. Turkey had officially prohibited any Coalition troops from using their bases or airspace, so lead elements of the 10th SFG {{had to make a}} detour infiltration; their flight was supposed to take four hours but instead took ten. On 22 March 2003, the majority of 2nd and 3rd battalion 10th SFG from Task Force Viking flew from their forward staging area in Constanta, Romania to a location near Irbil aboard six MC-130H Combat Talons, several were engaged by Iraqi air defences on the flight into northern Iraq (one was sufficiently damaged enough that it was forced to make an emergency landing at Incirlik Air Base). The initial lift had deployed a total of 19 Green Beret ODAs and four ODBs into Northern Iraq. Hours <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> such flights, Turkey did allow the use of its air space {{and the rest of the}} 10th SFG infiltrated in. The preliminary mission was to destroy the base of the Kurdish terrorist group Ansar al-Islam, believed to be linked to al-Qaeda. Concurrent and follow-on missions involved attacking and fixing Iraqi forces in the north, thus preventing their deployment to the southern front and the main effort of the invasion. Eventually Task Force Viking would number 51 ODAs and ODBs alongside some 60,000 Kurdish Peshmerga militia of the PUK (Patriotic Union of Kurdistan).|$|E
500|$|The Kuiper belt can {{be roughly}} divided into the [...] "classical" [...] belt and the {{resonance}}s. Resonances are orbits linked {{to that of}} Neptune (e.g. twice for every three Neptune orbits, or once for every two). The first resonance begins within the orbit of Neptune itself. The classical belt consists of objects having no resonance with Neptune, and extends from roughly 39.4AU to 47.7AU. Members of the classical Kuiper belt are classified as cubewanos, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> their kind to be discovered, , and are still in near primordial, low-eccentricity orbits.|$|E

500|$|According to {{one version}} of the story, while {{traversing}} the countryside, Radama and his men came across a wild zebu so exceptionally fat that the king {{decided to make a}} burnt offering of it. As the zebu flesh cooked, the enticing smell led Ralambo to taste the meat. He declared zebu meat to be fit for human consumption. In honor of the discovery, he decided to establish a holiday called fandroana that would be distinguished by the consumption of well-fattened zebu meat. [...] The holiday was to be celebrated on the day of his birth, which coincided with {{the first day of the}} year. To this end, the holiday symbolically represented a community-wide renewal that would take place over a period of several days before and <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> the year.|$|E
500|$|Once {{classified}} a hurricane, Igor underwent explosive intensification {{over the}} following 24hours. During this time, satellite observations indicated that the storm's winds increased from 75mph (120km/h) to 150mph (240km/h) and its barometric pressure decreased by 52mbar (hPa; 1.53inHg). Near {{the end of this}} phase, forecasters at the NHC predicted that Igor would attain Category5 status, the highest classification on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. With a symmetrical 17mi (27km) wide eye, deep convection and spiral banding, Igor maintained Category4 intensity for nearly five days. Minor fluctuations took place during this period as multiple eyewall replacement cycles occurred. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> these cycles, the hurricane is estimated to have reached its peak strength around 0000UTC on September15, with sustained winds of 155mph (250km/h) and an estimated minimum pressure of 924mbar (hPa; 27.29inHg). By this time, Igor began a northwestward track as it executed a prolonged [...] "C-shaped" [...] curve over the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
500|$|The Jones-produced {{sessions}} {{started in}} April 1969 at EMI Studios. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> these sessions, Barrett brought in friends to help out: Humble Pie drummer Jerry Shirley, and Jokers Wild (Gilmour's old band) drummer Willie Wilson. For the sessions, Gilmour played bass. Talking to Barrett wasn't easy, said Jones: [...] "It {{was a case}} of following him, not playing with him. They were seeing and then playing so they were always a note behind". A few tracks on the album feature overdubs by members of the band Soft Machine. During this time, Barrett also played guitar on the sessions for Soft Machine founder Kevin Ayers' debut LP Joy of a Toy, although his performance on [...] "Religious Experience" [...] (later titled [...] "Singing a Song in the Morning") was not released until the album was reissued in 2003. One time, Barrett had told his flatmate that he was going off [...] "for an afternoon drive". However, he followed Pink Floyd to Ibiza (according to legend, he skipped check-ins and customs, ran onto the runway and attempted to flag down a jet). One of his friends, J. Ryan Eaves, bass player for the short-lived but influential Manchester band [...] "York's Ensemble", later spotted him on a beach wearing messed-up clothes and with a carrier bag full of money. By this point, during the trip, Barrett had asked Gilmour for his help in the recording sessions.|$|E
