40|$|Abstract The {{disinfectants}} TriGene, bleach, ethanol {{and liquid}} <b>hand</b> <b>soap,</b> {{and water and}} temperature were tested {{for their ability to}} kill bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei, epimastigotes of Trypanosoma rangeli and promastigotes of Leishmania major. A 5 -min exposure to 0. 2 % TriGene, 0. 1 % liquid <b>hand</b> <b>soap</b> and 0. 05 % bleach (0. 05 % NaOCl) killed all three trypanosomatids. Ethanol and water destroyed the parasites within 5 min at concentrations of 15 – 17. 5 % and 80 – 90 %, respectively. All three organisms were also killed when treated for 5 min at 50 °C. The results indicate that the disinfectants, water and temperature treatment (i. e. autoclaving) are suitable laboratory hygiene measures against trypanosomatid parasites. </p...|$|R
40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] Urine samples that tested positive for two drugs of abuse, namely cannabis and methaqualone, were reassayed in {{the presence or absence}} of common household chemicals: Jik (sodium hypochlorite), Dettol (chloroxylenol), G-cide Plus (glutaraldehyde), Perle <b>Hand</b> <b>Soap,</b> ethanol, isopropanol and peroxide (20 volumes). These chemicals are frequently used for the adulteration of urine samples. Setting. Department of Pharmacology, University of Stellenbosch. Methods. Household chemicals, at three different concentrations, were added to urine samples that tested positive for methaqualone and cannabis. Samples were re-analysed on an ETS Plus Analyser (Syva company, San Jose, Ca.) using Emit drugs-of-abuse urine test reagents. Results. Most of the chemicals tested influenced the outcome of positive toxicological screening results for these drugs. G-cide (glutaraldehyde) and Perle <b>Hand</b> <b>Soap</b> had the largest effect (false-negative) on the methaqualone test. Dettol (chloroxylenol) and Perle <b>Hand</b> <b>Soap</b> had the largest effect on the cannabis test. Higher concentrations of the adulterant were not always an indication of the extent of modification of the test result. The addition of certain chemicals (ethanol, isopropanol and peroxide) to the urine samples tested for methaqualone interfered with the test to such an extent that it gave invalid test results.
