5|$|In spring 333 BC, Alexander {{crossed the}} Taurus into Cilicia. After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> due to illness, he marched on towards Syria. Though outmanoeuvered by Darius' {{significantly}} larger army, he marched back to Cilicia, where he defeated Darius at Issus. Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse, and left behind his wife, his two daughters, his mother Sisygambis, and a fabulous treasure. He offered {{a peace treaty}} that included the lands he had already lost, and a ransom of 10,000 talents for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.|$|E

25|$|After the Khmer advance was checked, Anawrahta {{turned his}} {{attention}} toward Nanzhao. Anawrahta led a campaign against the kingdom in the northeast. (According to a mid-17th century source, he began the march on 16 December 1757.) He advanced to Dali, the capital of Nanzhao Kingdom, ostensibly to seek a Buddha's tooth relic. As {{in the case of}} the request for the scriptures from Thaton, it was really a demand for tribute. The ruler of Nanzhao shut the gates, and would not give up the relic. After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> two kings exchanged presents and conversed amicably. The Nanzhao ruler gave Anawrahta a jade image which had come into contact with the tooth.|$|E
500|$|After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> of eruptions at the vent, the eruptions {{abruptly}} {{stopped there}} {{and returned to}} the Showa crater, on April 4, 2016, some 8–9 days preceding major 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes on the Median Tectonic Line near Kumamoto, Japan. Then, three months later, on July 26, it spewed volcanic ash [...] into the air.|$|E
500|$|Blender asked Bowie in 2002 {{whether he}} still {{believed}} his public declaration was his biggest mistake. After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> he said, [...] "I don't {{think it was}} a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people." [...] Bowie said {{he wanted to be a}} songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality, and in [...] "puritanical" [...] America, [...] "I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do".|$|E

500|$|In {{the centre}} of the attack, a company from each {{battalion}} advanced behind the barrage, to an observation line several hundred yards down the east slope of the ridge, at [...] assisted by eight tanks and patrols of cavalry. Most German troops encountered surrendered quickly, except at Leg Copse and Oosttaverne Wood where they offered slight resistance. British aircraft added to German difficulties, with low-level machine-gun attacks. The second objective (the observation line) from Bethleem Farm to south of Messines, Despagne Farm and Oosttaverne Wood, was reached with few casualties. Ground markers were put out for the three divisions due to attack in the afternoon and the area consolidated. The defensive frontages of the British units on the ridge had been based on an assumption that casualties in the advance to the first intermediate objective (blue line) would be [...] and in the advance to the ridge (black line) would be [...] There were far fewer British casualties than anticipated, which caused congestion on the ridge, where the attacking troops suffered considerable casualties from German long-range machine-gun and artillery fire. The British planners expected that the two German [...] divisions behind the ridge would begin organised counter-attacks at about , and arranged for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> in the advance down the eastern slope, thereby enabling an attack from consolidated defensive positions, rather than an encounter in the open while the British were still advancing. The masked batteries of the three reserve divisions were used to add to the protective barrage in front of the infantry but no Germans could be seen.|$|E
2500|$|... "Colored {{people lived}} in three neighborhoods that were clearly demarcated, as if by ropes or turnstiles," [...] wrote Harvard {{professor}} Henry Louis Gates, Jr. {{about growing up in}} segregated West Virginia in the 1960s. [...] "Welcome to the Colored Zone, a large stretched banner could have said.... Of course, the colored world was not so much a neighborhood as a condition of existence." [...] "For most of my childhood, we couldn't eat in restaurants or sleep in hotels, we couldn't use certain bathrooms or try on clothes in stores," [...] recalls Gates. His mother retaliated by not buying clothes that she was not allowed to try on. He remembered hearing a white man deliberately calling his father by the wrong name: [...] "'He knows my name, boy,' my father said after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause.</b> 'He calls all colored people George.'" [...] When Gates's cousin became the first black cheerleader at the local high school, she was not allowed to sit with the team and drink Coke from a glass but had to stand at the counter drinking from a paper cup. Professor Gates also wrote about his experiences in his 1995 book, Colored People: A Memoir.|$|E
2500|$|After {{over forty}} {{years on the}} air {{one of the most}} {{important}} aspects of the show is its huge stock of running gags which, if not always funny in themselves, can elicit huge anticipatory laughter from the studio audience. The mere mention of Lionel Blair will often bring roars of laughter in anticipation of an outrageous double-entendre based on his supposed homosexuality (he is not gay). In the [...] "Film Club" [...] round any reference by Graeme Garden to Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia is sure to cause a similar response. The game [...] "Wobbling Bunnies" [...] was introduced several times by Humph, often with eager anticipation by the panel and audience, but time pressures always meant the game was never actually played. Graeme Garden and Barry Cryer frequently play the characters of two Scots, Hamish and Dougal, whose skits usually begin with the phrase [...] "You'll have had your tea, then, Dougal?", as a stereotypical Scots miser when receiving a guest never offers any food or drink. The characters were [...] developed into their own Radio 4 show, Hamish and Dougal. Another long-running gag involves one of the panellists putting forward a challenge of [...] "hesitation" [...] when another panellist leaves <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> in the middle of speaking, a reference to Radio 4's other long-running panel show Just a Minute. (Likewise, occasionally on Just a Minute, a panellist will make a challenge of [...] "Mornington Crescent".) ...|$|E

2500|$|Sometime {{in the mid}} 200s, Gongsun Du {{gathered}} all {{his subordinates}} and asked them, [...] "I heard that Lord Cao is away on a campaign. Ye (around present-day Handan, Hebei) is unguarded. If I lead 30,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry to attack Ye, can anyone stop me?" [...] All of them agreed that Gongsun Du would succeed if he did so. After Gongsun Du sought his opinion, Liang Mao replied, [...] "The Han Empire {{is in a state}} of chaos and on the brink of collapse. General, you command thousands of troops, yet you sit here and watch others attack and destroy each other. As a subject of the Han Empire, is this what you should be doing? Lord Cao is concerned about the Han Empire's future and the people's welfare, which is why he leads an army of righteousness to eliminate tyrants and villains. He has made immense contributions and his virtues are well-known. There is none other like him in the Han Empire. As peace and stability has just recently been restored, it is only a matter of time before everyone starts pointing fingers at you, General, for not doing anything to save the Han Empire. Now, General, you want to lead your forces west to attack Ye? All it takes is one morning to find out the result of this test of survival and destruction. General, I hope you know what is good for you." [...] Gongsun Du's subordinates were shocked when they heard what Liang Mao said. After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> Gongsun Du said, [...] "What Administrator Liang said is correct." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hughes {{had made}} {{numerous}} business partnerships through industrialist and producer, David Charnay. Their friendship and many partnerships began with The Conqueror film, which was first {{released to the}} public in 1956. The film caused many controversies due to the film's radioactive location in St. George, Utah that eventually led to Hughes buying up nearly every copy of the film he could, only to watch the film at home repeatedly for many nights in a row. Charnay later bought the Four Star film and television production company that produced The Conqueror. Hughes and Charnay’s most published dealings were with a contested AirWest LBO. Charnay led the LBO buyout group that involved Howard Hughes and their partners acquiring Air West. Hughes, Charnay, as well as three others were indicted. The complexity of this LBO was the first of its kind. The indictment, made by U.S. Attorney DeVoe Heaton, accused the group of conspiring to drive down the stock price of Air West in order to pressure company directors to sell to Hughes. The charges were dismissed after a judge had determined that the indictment had failed to allege an illegal action on the part of Hughes, Charnay, and all the other accused in the indictment. Thompson, the federal judge that made the decision to dismiss the charges called the indictment one of the worst claims that he had ever seen. The charges were filed again, a second time, by U.S. Attorney DeVoe Heaton's assistant, Dean Vernon. The Federal Judge ruled on November 13, 1974 and elaborated to say that the case suggested a [...] "reprehensible misuse of the power of great wealth" [...] and in his judicial opinion, [...] "no crime had been committed." [...] The aftermath of the Air West deal was later settled with the SEC by paying former stockholders for alleged losses from the sale of their investment in Air West stock. As noted above, Air West was subsequently renamed Hughes Airwest. During <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> between the years of the dismissed charges against Hughes, Charnay, and their partners, Howard Hughes had mysteriously passed away mid-flight while on the way to Houston from Acapulco. No further attempts were made to file any indictments after Hughes had passed away.|$|E
