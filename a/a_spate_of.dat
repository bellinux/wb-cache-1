5|$|After the Act of Union of 1707, growing {{prosperity}} in Scotland led to <b>a</b> <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> new building, {{both public and}} private. The threat of Jacobite insurrection or invasion meant that Scotland saw more military building than England in this period. Military structures relied {{on the strength of}} inclined and angled engineered masonry and earthen toppings to deflect and absorb artillery fire. This spate of military building culminated in the construction of Fort George near Inverness (1748–69), with its projecting bastions and redoubts.|$|E
5|$|Anarchist writer Bob Black, {{a former}} member, has criticized the Church, {{alleging that the}} group {{has come to be}} {{characterized}} by conformism and submission to authority.

New international regulations have since been introduced to improve ship design and inspection, and to streamline the process of abandoning ship.|$|E

5|$|Anniyan was {{declared}} a blockbuster {{at the close}} of the year and, together with Chandramukhi, earned an estimated gross of 1.1 billion worldwide. The film also collected a distributor's share of 20 million. In Andhra Pradesh, Aparichitudu was named the biggest hit of 2005. The film did better business than straight Telugu films. It was the highest grosser among all Telugu films released that year. The film's success earned Vikram a big fan-following in Andhra. It also prompted producers in the Telugu film industry, which had hit a rough patch following <b>a</b> <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> box-office duds, to acquire the dubbing rights to Vikram's previous Tamil films and release them in Telugu.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1730s public taste for Italian opera was {{beginning}} to fade. The popular success of John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch's The Beggar's Opera (first performed in 1728) had heralded <b>a</b> <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> English-language ballad-operas that mocked the pretensions of Italian opera. With box-office receipts falling, Handel's productions were increasingly reliant on private subsidies from the nobility. Such funding became harder to obtain after the launch in 1730 of the Opera of the Nobility, a rival company to his own. Handel overcame this challenge, but he spent large sums {{of his own money}} in doing so.|$|E
5|$|Cotillo was {{member of}} the Joint Legislative Committee on Housing, {{also known as the}} Lockwood Committee because it was headed by Charles C. Lockwood. The {{committee}} investigated renting and building conditions in the City of New York and ended <b>a</b> <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> rent-raising {{as a result of the}} housing shortage after World War I. The group found that the housing conditions at the time constituted a serious menace to public health in New York since some 400,000 persons were directly affected by the scarcity of affordable dwellings and the poor quality of the existing ones. Later he was the chairman of New York state commission to investigate child welfare, and a {{member of the}} Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate Exploitation of Immigrants (1923–24).|$|E

50|$|The sultan died in late May {{or early}} June 1735. He had admonished {{his eldest son}} to respect the ex-sultan Jamal ul-Alam Badr ul-Munir. However, Jamal ul-Alam's {{political}} interference after his death led to <b>a</b> new <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> political infighting in Aceh.|$|R
5|$|Dukovac did {{not meet}} further success until 25 May, when he claimed two Supermarine Spitfire V fighters {{southeast}} of Temryuk. Two days later, he and two other pilots surprised eight LaGG-3s west of Trarehof, all of them claiming one, although Dukovac's claim was not witnessed. On 30 May, he was on another He 111 escort mission when he accounted for another LaGG-3. At this juncture there were <b>a</b> <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> defections from 15./JG 52, with pilots flying to Soviet airfields. The remaining pilots were questioned by the Luftwaffe, the Staffel was withdrawn from the front, and {{the commander of the}} HZL was replaced. This {{was the end of the}} second tour of 15./JG 52 on the Eastern Front, during which Dukovac had claimed 14 confirmed and six unconfirmed kills, five of which were later confirmed.|$|E
5|$|During Gladbach's opening {{match of}} the 2013–14 season against Bayern Munich, Domínguez conceded a penalty when he handled {{the ball in}} the box. Thomas Müller's {{resultant}} penalty was saved by goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen but Domínguez handled again from the rebound, giving away a second penalty which was duly converted by David Alaba. Gladbach ultimately lost the match 3–1. It was an injury-disrupted season for Domínguez, though, as early in October he suffered a broken collarbone and dislocated shoulder. He managed just 22 appearances for the campaign, and 34 in the next before <b>a</b> <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> back injuries severely curtailed his playing time in the seasons that followed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, opium dens {{used to be}} common in the Sungei Road area. The drugs were popular with workers looking for a cheap way to ease the {{hardship}} of the day's toil. The opium addicts were mainly poor, elderly people from working-class groups. In early 1991, <b>a</b> <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> fires destroyed more than 20 shophouses along Sungei Road. Most of the century-old shophouses, crumbling with age, had become potential fire hazards for its residents. The first fire incident left two people injured and 61 homeless. As a result, many of its buildings were torn down for safety reason and its inhabitants relocated in later years.|$|E

Betty becomes famous in Weatherfield for her hotpots, which come under scrutiny in the early 1990s when it is believed that they are contaminated. She is cleared of all wrongdoing when it is discovered that beer, not food, is responsible for <b>a</b> <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> stomach upsets. Betty acts as lady mayoress alongside mayor Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley) when his wife Audrey (Sue Nicholls) has no interest in fulfilling her civic duties. This includes accompanying him to receive his OBE from the Queen, much to Audrey's chagrin.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before his}} {{election}} as the Yang-Di Pertuan Agong in 1983, <b>a</b> <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> reports alleging Sultan Iskandar's intention {{to launch a}} coup d'état by launching {{a state of emergency}} to overthrow the government circulated within political circles, which reached Mahathir himself. The Sultan was reportedly having fostered close relations with several key military personnel, including the Army chief himself. The government subsequently took action to curb constitutional loopholes within the constitution and took to task of reducing the power of royal veto in passing legislation, culminating to a constitutional crisis in late 1983. Nevertheless, during his inaugural speech as the Agong in 1984, about a month after the constitutional amendments were passed in parliament, Sultan Iskandar voiced public support for the revised constitution and pledged to act in accordance to the Prime Minister's advise.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Newfoundland pony arrived in Newfoundland from the British Isles, brought there by settlers between 1611 and the mid-1900s. Dartmoor ponies formed the initial shipment, imported by John Guy, the first Proprietary Governor of Newfoundland. Lord Falkland imported additional animals soon after, and these were followed by <b>a</b> <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> pony shipments from England, Ireland and Scotland. Additional breeds found in the shipments included the now-extinct Galloway pony, as well as Connemara, Dartmoor, Exmoor, Fell, Highland and New Forest ponies. Beginning with the first imports, the breeds crossbred, eventually forming the modern Newfoundland pony.|$|E
