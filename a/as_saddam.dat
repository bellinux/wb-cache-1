25|$|Some, such as Laurie Mylroie, {{suggest that}} {{democracy}} and Islamic tradition are incompatible, and illiberal Islamists may {{be worse than}} the current authoritarian regimes (although she suggests {{it may be useful}} for the United States to promote human rights and democracy in certain parts of the Middle East to oppose dictators such <b>as</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein). Others stress the compatibility of democracy and the Islamic notion of shura, or consultation, and say that Western and international donors should not hesitate to promote democracy as a means of encouraging Arab democrats and responsible governance practices.|$|E
25|$|Dinkha {{established}} headquarters—along {{with four}} other houses of worship—in Chicago, Illinois, United States, {{in part due to}} the instability of the Iran–Iraq War. This conflict as well <b>as</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's policy of Arabization in Iraq, the Gulf War and subsequent sanctions against Iraq intensified the Assyrian diaspora from the region. Meanwhile, the Islamic Revolution and Shi'a emphasis in Iran created a tense situation for Assyrians in the Middle East. During the reign of Shimun XXIII and Dinkha IV, American membership in the Church of the East rose from 3,200 in the 1950s to approximately 100,000 in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, he {{went for}} a period of Islamic study at a Shiite seminary in Najaf, Iraq. Nasrallah was forced to return to Lebanon in 1979, by that time having {{completed}} the first part of his study, <b>as</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein was expelling many Shia's, including Khomeini and Abbas Musawi a year earlier. Back in Lebanon, he studied and taught at the school of Amal’s leader Abbas al-Musawi, later being selected as Amal's political delegate in Beqaa, and making him a member of the central political office. Around the same time, in 1980, Saddam Hussein had Sadr executed.|$|E

The assassination was accused upon Samir Geagea in coordination with the Lebanese army, but would not be proven. President Gemayel's term of office expired in September 1988. Before stepping down, he appointed another Maronite Christian, Lebanese Armed Forces Commanding General Michel Aoun, as acting Prime Minister, contravening the National Pact. Conflict in this period was also exacerbated by increasing Iraqi involvement, <b>as</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein searched for proxy battlefields for the Iran–Iraq War. To counter Iran's influence through Amal and Hezbollah, Iraq backed Maronite groups; Saddam Hussein helped Aoun and the Lebanese Forces led by Samir Geagea between 1988 and 1990.|$|E
500|$|The BBC Foreign Affairs Editor John Simpson {{encountered}} similar difficulties on {{the issue}} of censorship while reporting from Iraq during the Gulf War in 1990–91.

Adnan questions Uday's abilities as Iraq's future leader, but is not supported by Hussein Kamel, who continues to gain Saddam's trust. Not long after, Adnan is killed in a suspicious helicopter explosion. Sajida confronts Saddam about her brother's death, but he dismisses her with claims that it was merely an accident.|$|R

50|$|Al-Naqib {{sought to}} provide the MOI with {{effective}} Iraqi constabulary forces after the poor performance of the police in battles against Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr’s Mahdi Army. Al-Naqib created “commando units” of former soldiers from elite units such <b>as</b> <b>Saddam’s</b> Republican Guard.These units, commanded by al-Naqib’s uncle, Adnan Thabit, a former army general, were personally loyal to the minister. The commandos were raised initially without U.S. involvement, were under MOI control, and were outside the U.S. Civilian Police Assistance Training Team (CPATT) assistance program. The U.S. military provided arms and logistical support to these units, which proved effective under Minister al-Naqib’s stewardship in fighting alongside U.S. forces against Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias.|$|R

500|$|During the insurgency's Ramadan Offensive, a {{military}} Chinook transport helicopter carrying 32 soldiers {{was shot down}} with an SA-7 missile near Fallujah on 2 November. Thirteen were killed and the rest wounded. Following the shootdown, Fallujah {{was quiet for a}} few months. On 5 November, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced that the Marines would return to Iraq early the next year and would take over Anbar Province. As the Marines prepared to move in, there was a growing consensus that the 82nd had lost control of the area, although the only real problem was Fallujah. Some Marine commanders, like Major General James Mattis and Lieutenant Colonel Carl Mundy, criticized the Army's tactics as [...] "hard-nosed" [...] and [...] "humiliating the Sunni population", promising that the Marines would act differently. Late that November, Operators from A Squadron SAS launched a heliborne assault on a remote farm in Al Anbar province, after they came under fire from insurgents inside, air support was called in and hit the farm, after it was cleared; seven dead insurgents were found whom American intelligence believed were foreign fighters. [...] Riots in Fallujah and Ramadi followed the December capture of Saddam Hussein. The capture of Saddam created significant problems in Anbar: instead of weakening the insurgency, many Anbaris were outraged over what they saw as the degrading treatment of Saddam. Saddam's removal allowed the insurgency to recruit fighters who had previously opposed the Americans but had remained passive out of hatred for Saddam. <b>As</b> <b>Saddam</b> loyalists were killed or captured, leadership positions went to AQI-affiliated hardliners such as Abdullah Abu Azzam al-Iraqi, who was directly responsible for murdering government officials in 2004. While the Ba'ath Party continued {{to play a major role}} in the insurgency, the balance of power had shifted to various religious leaders who were advocating a jihad against American forces.|$|E

At the end of the trip, Saddam invited the scientist to his office and told him: [...] "You have done enough for your country; don't go back. Stay here and take over our nuclear programme. I will pay you whatever you want." [...] Ramanna was shocked and scared by the Iraqi proposal. He reportedly could not sleep that night, worried that he might never see his homeland again.

5000|$|The tribe rose to {{prominence}} in the 1960s, when one of its members, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, seized power in Iraq. Bakr's successor, Saddam Hussein, was {{also a member of}} the Al-Bu Nasir and the tribe became a crucial element of his hold in power from 1979 to 2003. Saddam drew heavily on the tribe to fill the upper echelons of his government and in particular to manage his security apparatus, notably the Intelligence Service and the Special Republican Guard. Most of the key posts in the Iraqi government were held by members of the Beijat clan group and Majid extended family to which Saddam belonged; some elements of the regime's security apparatus, such <b>as</b> <b>Saddam's</b> bodyguards, were recruited exclusively from the al-Bu Nasir ...|$|R

2500|$|In the 1974 Arab League summit held in Morocco on 26October, a Fatah plot {{to assassinate}} Hussein upon his arrival was {{uncovered}} by the Moroccan authorities. The plot did not deter Hussein from joining the summit, {{but at the}} end Jordan had to join all the Arab countries in recognizing the PLO as [...] "the sole representative of the Palestinian people", a diplomatic defeat for Hussein. The relationship between Jordan and the United States deteriorated when Jordan refused to join the Camp David Accords. The Accords formed the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, and allowed the withdrawal of Israel from the Sinai. In 1978 Hussein went to Baghdad {{for the first time since}} 1958; there, he met Iraqi politician Saddam Hussein. When Saddam became president of Iraq in 1979, Hussein supported Saddam's Iran–Iraq War that stretched from 1980 to 1988.

According to Jalopnik website, Uday's vast car collections were burned by his father, Saddam, after the Kamel Hana Gegeo incident. Before an assemblage of horrified guests, an intoxicated Uday bludgeoned Gegeo and repeatedly stabbed him with an electric carving knife. Gegeo had recently introduced Saddam to a younger woman, Samira Shahbandar, who later became Saddam's second wife. Uday considered his father's relationship with Shahbandar an insult to his mother. He also may have feared losing succession to Gegeo, whose loyalty and fidelity to Saddam Hussein was unquestioned..|$|R
