5|$|On microscopy, {{the tumor}} cells are {{typically}} described as small, round and blue, and rosette patterns (Homer Wright rosettes) may be seen. Homer Wright rosettes are tumor cells around the neuropil, {{not to be}} confused with pseudorosettes, which are tumor cells around <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> vessel. They are also distinct from the pseudorosettes of an ependymoma which consist of tumor cells with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)–positive processes tapering off toward <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> vessel (thus a combination of the two). A variety of immunohistochemical stains are used by pathologists to distinguish neuroblastomas from histological mimics, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, lymphoma and Wilms' tumor.|$|E

5|$|A {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} test on <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> sample from affected animals will confirm a suspected case by identifying the viral DNA, though it is now common to start famciclovir treatment at the earliest possible moment rather than waiting for confirmation of the case.

5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> clot that becomes {{lodged in the}} pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E

5|$|Aegaeon– Featured in Ascension, Aegaeon the Hecatonchires had pledged <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> oath to Zeus, {{but later}} betrayed the god. The first {{victim of the}} Furies, they {{captured}} and tortured the multi-armed creature. Instead of killing him, the Furies turned him to stone, making him the giant Prison of the Damned and becoming a symbol to all who may think of breaking <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> oath to a god. As Kratos attempted to escape the prison, Megaera used her parasitic insects to bring Aegaeon to life and control him as his many arms mutated into monstrous forms and began to attack the Spartan. Fending off two of its parasite-controlled arms, Megaera then infected Aegaeon's head, which attacked Kratos, but the Spartan outsmarted and killed Megaera; this also caused Aegaeon to die, freeing him from his suffering.|$|E

On September 9, 2008, Angle was cleared of all charges.|$|E
5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones {{can be measured in}} the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E

This is the first song recorded with Maxwell.

5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (<b>a</b> <b>blood</b> clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs {{on one side of the}} body, and seizures. The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E
5|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}}, or deep {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is the formation of <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, {{is caused by the}} detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E

5|$|During their investigation, Pembleton and Bayliss learn Kaja {{has been}} in a Haitian prison for four months, {{eliminating}} him as a lead. Gee announces the Baltimore Sun is running a story that Kaja has been cleared as a suspect, leaked from the police. Pembleton accuses Ballard and Gharty of leaking the story, while Gharty accuses Pembleton of going easy on Felix Wilson because he is a successful black man. The discussion prompts a heated argument with accusations of racism from both sides. Pembleton agrees to interview Felix Wilson alone because he believes it will clear him. When Pembleton tells Wilson he needs <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> test from him and his son, Wilson admits that he had consensual sex with Brierre the night of the murder, but said he does not kill her. Later, a devastated Pembleton and Gee still insist he should not necessarily be treated as a suspect, much to the disbelief of Ballard and Gharty. The detectives are interrupted by Wilson's attorney, who says the family will not submit to <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> and hair test without a court order.|$|E

5|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) is {{the development}} of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant. HIT predisposes to thrombosis (the abnormal formation of blood clots inside <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> vessel) because platelets release microparticles that activate thrombin, thereby leading to thrombosis. When thrombosis is identified the condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal antibodies that activate platelets. If someone receiving heparin develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the platelet count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.|$|E
