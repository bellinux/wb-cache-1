40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{approach}} {{will be made}} to a general view on tolerances in mechanical engineering, especially on tolerancing and optimising tolerance specifications by five major strategies. To improve the quality of a product the tolerancing problem may not be seen isolated, also <b>adjoining</b> <b>subjects</b> have to be considered, as the stiffness and elastic deformation of machine parts, the construction structure, manufacturing processes, the assembly of components and the use of a product (multi-criterial optimisation). One of the possibilities is the use of tolerance controlled constraints. These consequences of the product tolerancing will have to be investigated by the designer during the design process. Therefore, computer supported tools, which are integrated into an Engineering Workbench (overall architecture) to support the activities of the designer in each stage of the product development process, help to solve design conflicts...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. This paper {{considers}} {{the nature of}} information science as a discipline and profession. Method. It is based on conceptual analysis of the information science literature, and consideration of philosophical perspectives, particularly those of Kuhn and Peirce. Results. It is argued that information science may {{be understood as a}} field of study, with human recorded information as its concern, focusing on the components of the information chain, studied through the perspective of domain analysis, in specific or general contexts. A particular aspect of interest is those aspects of information organization, and of human information-related behaviour, which are invariant to changes in technology. Information science can also be seen as a science of evaluation of information, understood as semantic content with respect to qualitative growth of knowledge and change in knowledge structures in domains. Conclusions. This study contributes {{to the understanding of the}} unique 'academic territory' of information science, a discipline with an identity distinct from <b>adjoining</b> <b>subjects...</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} the mixed mode response of concrete interfaces is reported. Large simulated rock/concrete bimaterial specimens {{are subjected to}} the complex stress field that exists along a dam/foundation interface. Based on the observed crack trajectory, and on the recorded loads and displacements, important qualitative conclusions are drawn. It was observed that a crack which initiates at the interface is likely to kink into the <b>adjoining</b> rock when <b>subjected</b> to mixed mode loading as in a dam, and that the overall interface strength is only slightly affected by the curvilinear crack...|$|R
50|$|Ownership of the {{submerged}} lands {{was resolved}} by Congress passing the Submerged Lands Act, which confirmed state {{title to the}} beds of all tidal and navigable bodies of water.

Waters <b>subject</b> to {{the ebb and flow of}} the tides, even if non-navigable, also passed to the states, but the continued ownership and public use of these tidal/marsh lands are based on state laws.|$|R
60|$|It also deserves notice, as {{indirectly}} {{bearing on}} our subject, that {{the eye and}} <b>adjoining</b> parts are <b>subject</b> to an extraordinary number of reflex and associated movements, sensations, and actions, besides those relating to the lacrymal glands. When a bright light strikes the retina of one eye alone, the iris contracts, but the iris of the other eye moves after a measurable interval of time. The iris likewise moves in accommodation to near or distant vision, and when the two eyes are made to converge.[23] Every one knows how irresistibly the eyebrows are drawn down under an intensely bright light. The eyelids also involuntarily wink when an object is moved near the eyes, or a sound is suddenly heard. The well-known case of a bright light causing some persons to sneeze is even more curious; for nerve-force here radiates from certain nerve-cells {{in connection with the}} retina, to the sensory nerve-cells of the nose, causing it to tickle; and from these, to the cells which command the various respiratory muscles (the orbiculars included) which expel the air in so peculiar a manner that it rushes through the nostrils alone.|$|R
40|$|Freedom of {{contract}} or contractualism {{is the idea}} that individuals should be free to bargain among themselves the terms of their own contracts, without government interference. Anything more than minimal regulations and taxes may be seen as infringements. It is the underpinning of the theory of laissez-faire economics. In the sphere of the private law, the agreement constitutes the traditional mean which generates relations among different categories of <b>subjects.</b> <b>Adjoining</b> to all these, the public law uses the institutions stipulated by a contract as special means in achieving the purposes of public interest. Freedom of public contracts is limited today by the competition law. Today competition law pervades every aspect of doing business in Europe. As a consequence, each business that is active in Europe is continually faced with the challenge of conforming its commercial objectives and practices to the EC competition rules. Abuse of a dominant position is prohibited by Article 82 EC Treaty. The frequent adoption of narrow market definitions and low thresholds for establishing dominance in Europe makes compliance with Article 82 a concern for many companies that would not qualify as traditional “monopolists”. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports an {{experimental}} program aiming to {{shed some light}} on the response of non-seismic RC beam-column joints to excitations of different frequencies. The RC connections tested were designed only for gravity loads, thus rendering the joint cores weaker than the <b>adjoining</b> members when <b>subjected</b> to a lateral load. Altogether, six tests were conducted on full-scale specimens, which were subjected to reversed cyclic displacements applied at different speeds varying from slow quasi-static loading to high-speed dynamic loading as fast as 20 Hz. Although all specimens expectedly suffered joint shear failure, the maximum joint shear stresses observed in the tested specimens, despite lacking transverse hoops inside the joint cores, were more than the horizontal shear stresses allowed in ductile RC joints with the same grade of concrete according to the existing seismic design codes. The damage patterns and failures of the specimens showed a better correlation with the residual storey shear stiffness rather than with the loss of storey shear strength during the repeated cycles. By analysing the test results, this paper also discusses how an inadvertent inertial force develops during high-speed displacement reversals...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the principles and parameters approach to linguistic theory, this study explores consequences of the requirement that movement be shortest (the Shortest Movement Condition or SMC). It is demonstrated that the SMC, in combination with other independently necessary assumptions, derives the effects of barriers and head government, making them superfluous and thus eliminable. ^ The theory of adjunction {{plays an important role in}} elimination of barriers. This study proposes that adjunction not be permitted to a member of a group that respects uniformity, such as a nontrivial chain and a coordination. From this uniformity condition it follows that adjunction is disallowed to subjects in languages where they are obligatorily raised out of VP, and to adjuncts given that adjuncts involve coordination. These results receive empirical support from a number of languages. ^ The SMC, in conjunction with the uniformity condition on adjunction, has an effect of prohibiting extraction out of subjects and adjuncts: Such extraction must pass over positions <b>adjoined</b> to <b>subjects</b> and adjuncts and thus necessarily fails to make the shortest movement. Since this explains the effects of the Subject Condition and the Adjunct Condition without recourse to barriers, it makes barriers superfluous. ^ The SMC has a further consequence of deriving the complementizer-trace effect, if combined with the independently motivated assumption that adjunction to IP is impermissible from the specifier of IP: Movement from the specifier of IP must skip the position adjoined to IP, so that such movement cannot be shortest. The absence of the complementizer-trace effect in cases where the complementizer is null is predicted if those cases involve movement of Infl to Comp, which makes the specifier of Comp and the IP-adjoined position equidistant from the specifier of IP so that the IP-adjoined position may be skipped. This approach receives empirical support from various languages, and is shown to be superior to a previous analysis based on the notion of head government. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of feral cats (Felis catus) were assessed at Shark Bay at two <b>adjoining</b> sites <b>subject</b> to differing intensities of predator control. The Heirisson Prong conservation reserve (12 km 2) was fenced to exclude predators and {{was subject to}} intensive control actions, while {{a portion of the}} adjoining Carrarang pastoral lease (60 km 2) was subject to a lesser level of control. Foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were largely absent at both sites owing to effective control. Densities of cats were highly variable over time, showing strong annual fluctuations over 14 years of records Three independent estimates of peak density were made, varying between 1. 5 and 2. 8 km 2. Rate of increase was assessed as 0. 98 on the pastoral lease and 0. 99 on the conservation reserve (to give an approximate doubling of the population every 8. 5 months). A logistic model, with K = 1. 5 km- 2 and r of 0. 98, gave a maximum sustained yield of 0. 37 cats km- 2 year- 1 and a harvest rate of > 0. 6 cats km- 2 year- 1 for their elimination in 5 years or less (for K = 2. 8 km- 2, these values increase to 0. 69 and > 1. 05 km- 2 year- 1 respectively). Harvest outcomes at both sites were consistent with these models. However, the effort required to maintain a given offtake rate increased 6 -fold at low cat densities and offtake by trapping as a function of cat density took the form of a Type 3 functional response. The functional response for cat trapping (the offtake with constant effort per unit time) overlaid against the curve of cat productivity suggested a stable equilibrium point at low cat densities (0. 07 - 0. 13 cats km- 2). Hence, trapping effort needed to be greatly intensified at low cat densities and/or augmented by other methods of control to eradicate cats from the closed system of the reserve. The strongly male-biased sex ratio of captures at the barrier fence suggested high levels of reinvasion from beyond the harvested area of the pastoral lease and this made effective control in this open system difficult...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a brief argument from {{the interaction of}} weak crossover (WCO), antecedent-contained deletion (ACD), and other facts of VP-ellipsis that subjects are base-generated in a predicate-internal position but move through an intermediate A-position {{on their way to}} their final landing site (the specifier of TP) and can take scope in this intermediate position. The following example, from Evans 1988 (14), is a puzzle for standard accounts of VP-ellipsis and weak crossover: (1) Someone who shouldn’t have kissed each man. As Evans points out, this sentence is ambiguous, having among its possi-ble readings the one given in (2), which will be of interest here. (2) ∀x(man(x) → ∃y[person(y) ∧ kissed(y, x) ∧ shouldn′t-have-kissed(y, x) ]) The important thing to note in characterizing this reading is that the deleted VP in the relative clause <b>adjoined</b> to the <b>subject</b> DP contains a variable bound by the object quantifier. It is parallel, thus, to more familiar and often discussed examples like (3 a), which has a reading like that of (3 b) (see Sag 1976, Dalrymple et al. 1991, Hardt 1999, among many others) : (3) a. John greeted each arriving guest after Mary did. b. John greeted [each arriving guest] 1 after Mary greeted him 1. 1 In one influential strand of analyses of VP-ellipsis (Sag 1976, Fiengo and May 1994, Fox 2000 etc.), the reading in (2) would be generated by giving (1) the structure in (4 a) (see Merchant 2001 for extensive justification that A′-traces can license the deletion of pronouns, in line with Fiengo and May 1994 and pace Safir 1998). At LF, after QR has applied to the object each man, the pronoun is bound and gives rise to the attested reading: (4) a. Someone who shouldn’t have kissed each man 2. b. [each man] 2 [someone who shouldn’t have kissed t 2] The puzzle arises because the movement of each man in (4 b) is expected to give rise to a WCO violation, assuming that WCO effects derive from the constraint like the one in (5) or more refined versions with an equivalen...|$|R
