Clive Hart argues that [...] "hatever our conclusions about the identity of the dreamer, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> many varied caricatures of him we may find projected into the dream, it is clear that he must always be considered as essentially external to the book, and should be left there. Speculation about the 'real person' behind the guises of the dream-surrogates or about the function of the dream in relation to the unresolved stresses of this hypothetical mind is fruitless, for the tensions and psychological problems in Finnegans Wake concern the dream-figures living within the book itself." ...|$|E

Early this week he hit upon the successful plan, and now the many visitors who attend his classes are spectators of thrilling love scenes.

[...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's the one you think of when you think of a Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are really stupid and self-serving, but if you give them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E

2500|$|Haldane (1957 [...] ) drew {{attention}} to the fact that in the process of the evolutionary substitution of one allele for another, at any intensity of selection <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> slight the importance of the locus, a substantial number of individuals would usually be lost because they did not already possess the new allele. Kimura (1960, 1961) has referred to this loss as the substitutional (or evolutional) load, but because it necessarily involves either a completely new mutation or (more usually) previous change in the environment or the genome, I like to think of it as a dilemma for the population: for most organisms, rapid turnover in a few genes precludes rapid turnover in the others. A corollary of this is that, if an environmental change occurs that necessitates the rather rapid replacement of several genes if a population is to survive, the population becomes extinct.|$|E

2500|$|Dearth's {{works from}} the 1890s to the early 1900s show {{him to be the}} {{landscape}} painter of considerable delicacy, refinement, and imaginative feeling. Paintings such as Springtme Montigny (1899) and Montigny (1898) exemplify his conscientious regard for the facts of nature, combined with a notable faculty for their poetic interpretation in artistic terms. His pictures are full of light and atmosphere, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> brilliant his color schemes, the result is a subtle depth of tone instead of hardness. When Boulogne Harbor was exchanged for Cornelia in Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Times critic commented that [...] "the two pictures seen together would have formed an extraordinary commentary on the completeness and rapidity of a style change possible to an impressionable painter". [...] In the works dating from 1912 and beyond, he freely used pure color spots and splashes in order to render what he saw so that the paintings display great harmony and are pervaded with a rich, unctuous feeling.|$|E
2500|$|Compared with Laid, {{which was}} {{referred}} to as the [...] "song" [...] album of the pair, Wah Wah was known as the [...] "experimental" [...] or [...] "jamming" [...] album, and contains 23 highly experimental tracks.

[...] The album shares Laids general focus towards an [...] "evocative, restrained attractiveness and moody melancholy," [...] but Wah Wah features more immediate numbers with full lyrics from Booth sung in his [...] "fine voice" [...] mixed with more open-ended instrumental or wordless vocal jams. [...] Some songs are by default much more fragmentary than others, lyrics [...] "just dreamed up of the top of Booth's head," [...] the rest of the band working around a rhythm loop or quietly rolling rhythm. Almost Cool said that [...] "amid the backwash of soundscapes, it's still James, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> much sounds there are, Tim Booths vocals are still present, whether it's as a nearly unrecognizable cut-up wash of sound, or straight-up on fairly normal-sounding (for the group) tracks." [...] The Harvard Crimson described Wah Wah as the [...] "dark side" [...] of Laid, and commented that [...] "the 23 tracks reflect two general moods: one, a dreamy, new-age rain-foresty wash of sound over which an cerie voice intones barely audible lyrics; the other, an abrasive, Achtung Baby industrial-esque sound with distorted, staticky vocals," [...] whilst The A.V. Club said Wah Wah was [...] "a diverse, patchwork-sounding record that touched on abstract electronic experiments and noisy rock tangles." ...|$|E
