60|$|Socialism is <b>against</b> Human <b>Nature.</b> This {{objection}} I {{have left}} until last because, firstly, {{it is absolutely}} true, and secondly, it leads naturally to the newer ideas that have already peeped out once or twice in my earlier chapters and which will now ride up to a predominance in what follows, and particularly the idea that an educational process and a moral discipline are not only a necessary part, but the most fundamental part of any complete Socialist scheme. Socialism is <b>against</b> Human <b>Nature.</b> That is true, and it is equally true of everything else; capitalism is <b>against</b> human <b>nature,</b> competition is <b>against</b> human <b>nature,</b> cruelty, kindness, religion and doubt, monogamy, polygamy, celibacy, decency, indecency, piety and sin are all <b>against</b> human <b>nature.</b> The present system in particular is <b>against</b> human <b>nature,</b> or what is the policeman for, the soldier, the debt-collector, the judge, the hangman? What means the glass along my neighbour's wall? Human <b>nature</b> is <b>against</b> human <b>nature.</b> For human nature is in a perpetual conflict; it is the Ishmael of the universe, against everything, and with everything against it; and within, no more and no less than a perpetual battleground of passion, desire, cowardice, indolence and good will. So that our initial proposition as it stands {{at the head of}} this section, is, as an argument against Socialism, just worth nothing at all.|$|R

25|$|Homosexual {{behavior}} is a ground for divorce, {{an act of}} sexual misconduct punishable as a crime in Alabama, a crime <b>against</b> <b>nature,</b> an inherent evil, and an act so heinous that it defies one's ability to describe it. That is enough under the law to allow a court to consider such activity harmful to a child. To declare that homosexuality is harmful {{is not to make}} new law but to reaffirm the old; {{to say that it is}} not harmful is to experiment with people's lives, particularly the lives of children.|$|E

40|$|Cyberporn {{case has}} become a {{challenge}} for the Judge in East Java jurisdiction to fulfill legal provisions and uphold law in the society. The problem appears on the meaning of <b>nature</b> <b>against</b> material law itself under judge’s consideration and the measurement used to determine that a judge has imposed <b>nature</b> <b>against</b> material law. In order to decrease the problem, research method of socio-legal is used to analyze the basic law of imposition of <b>nature</b> <b>against</b> material law {{associated with the use of}} <b>nature</b> <b>against</b> material law by judge in examining and deciding a case. The result of research shows that judge considers <b>nature</b> <b>against</b> material law in giving verdict for cyberporn case. Judge’s consideration on norms of morality is based on religious aspect, culture and the development of people’s condition. Judge’s verdict also includes socio-juridical which is automatically accepted by the society. Keywords: <b>nature</b> <b>against</b> material law, judge, cyberpor...|$|R

The characters in Light in Augustwho are mostly from the lower classes, with the exception of Reverend Hightower and Joanna Burdenare united by poverty and Puritanical values that cause them to regard an unwed mother like Lena Grove with disdain. Faulkner shows the restrictiveness and aggression of their Puritanical zeal, which has caused them to become [...] "deformed" [...] in their struggle <b>against</b> <b>nature.</b>|$|E

500|$|Rothbard was {{a strong}} critic of egalitarianism. The title essay of Rothbard's 1974 book Egalitarianism as a Revolt <b>Against</b> <b>Nature</b> and Other Essays held, [...] "Equality {{is not in the}} natural order of things, and the crusade to make {{everyone}} equal in every respect (except before the law) is certain to have disastrous consequences." [...] In it, Rothbard wrote, [...] "At the heart of the egalitarian left is the pathological belief that there is no structure of reality; that all the world is a tabula rasa that can be changed at any moment in any desired direction by the mere exercise of human will." ...|$|E
500|$|After On the Origin of Species was published, Darwin became {{involved}} in producing revised editions as well as working on Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication as {{the first part of}} his planned [...] "Big Book". By the spring of 1860 he had tired of the grind of writing, and needed something fresh and interesting to study. During a family visit to relatives at Hartfield, he was searching for orchids when he noticed a sundew. He collected it and tried to feed it insects, thus beginning a long-term study of insectivorous plants. He investigated other botanical questions raised by his ideas of natural selection, including the advantages of sexual dimorphism in primulas, and the adaptive mechanisms that ensure cross-pollination in orchids. As an enthusiastic practical scientist, such investigations gave him a strong sense of personal enjoyment. He relished pitting his wits <b>against</b> <b>nature,</b> and following lucky hunches. His theory was a {{way of looking at the}} world, enabling him to find creative solutions to problems that traditional approaches could not solve. He later wrote, [...] "I am like a gambler, & love a wild experiment." ...|$|E

40|$|Using a {{new data}} set on annual deaths from {{disasters}} in 57 nations from 1980 to 2002, this paper tests several hypotheses concerning natural disaster mitigation. While richer nations do not experience fewer natural disaster events than poorer nations, richer nations do suffer less death from disaster. Economic development provides implicit insurance <b>against</b> <b>nature’s</b> shocks. Democracies and nations with higher quality institutions suffer less death from natural disaster. The results are relevant for judging {{the incidence of}} a Global Warming induced increase in the count of natural disaster shocks...|$|R
