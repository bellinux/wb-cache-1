5|$|The Queen {{is one of}} the Overtakers, villains of The Kingdom Keepers novel series. She was {{introduced}} in 2011 in the fourth book of the saga, Power Play, alongside Cruella De Vil. Like Maleficent, she is very powerful and is able to cast almost any spell with <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> her finger; she can also transform herself and other characters. In Power Play, when Maleficent and Chernabog are captured by the Keepers, the Queen becomes the new leader of the Overtakers.|$|E
5|$|With an {{unconventional}} front-on bowling action, Meckiff progressed through the district cricket ranks at South Melbourne Cricket Club, making his first-class debut for Victoria in 1956–57. After a productive first season, Meckiff was named in a new-look Australian {{team for the}} 1957–58 tour of South Africa. This {{was the result of}} a generational change in the Australian Test team after a decline in performances in the 1950s. The shift saw Meckiff open the bowling in his debut Test, where he performed strongly to take eight wickets. Generating his pace from an unusual bent-arm action which involved <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrist, Meckiff reached his peak in the Second Test of the 1958–59 season against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He took 6/38 in the second innings as England were dismissed for 87, setting up an Australian victory. His achievement was engulfed by controversy, as English media and former players accused him of throwing Australia to victory.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched New Guinea {{crocodiles}} feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, {{so does the}} size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout sideways and snapping at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth with <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey {{to the back of the}} mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe into the mud at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|E
50|$|The male species produce's a {{monotonous}} call of piercing shrillness, and {{the introductory}} notes have a distinctive throbbing sound. The females respond by clicking, produced by <b>a</b> <b>flicking</b> <b>of</b> the wings. Distant notes that Guy Marshall collected specimens from the Machabel tree (Brachystegia boehmii Taub.).|$|R
5000|$|Return boomerangs have a flat {{convex surface}} {{that must be}} thrown upright with <b>a</b> sharp <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrist, but {{throwing}} sticks are thrown horizontally.|$|R
5000|$|Many modern {{cars have}} a [...] "one-touch" [...] feature on their stalks. This is {{primarily}} based on (motorway) lane-switching, where <b>a</b> single <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the indicator will {{cause it to}} flash between two and six times.|$|R
25|$|Aquatic species rarely display any {{particular}} specializations for jumping. Those {{that are good}} jumpers usually are primarily adapted for speed, and execute moving jumps by simply swimming to the surface at a high velocity. A few primarily aquatic species that can jump while on land, such as mud skippers, do so via <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the tail.|$|E
25|$|If the tubing label {{has been}} lost, a {{high-quality}} (chromoly or manganese) steel frame can {{be recognized by}} tapping it sharply with <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the fingernail. A high-quality frame will produce a bell-like ring where a regular-quality steel frame will produce a dull thunk. They can also be recognized by their weight (around 2.5kg for frame and forks) {{and the type of}} lugs and fork ends used.|$|E
25|$|Mendis, {{although}} {{classified as}} slow-medium, bowls {{a mixture of}} deliveries, including googlies, off-breaks, top-spinners, flippers and leg-breaks, {{as well as the}} carrom ball, released with <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> his middle finger. For Sri Lanka Army in 2007–08 he averaged a mere 10.56 and took 46 wickets in six games, his strike rate a startling 31. This gained him a call-up to the full Sri Lanka squad for the Caribbean tour in April 2008.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} a crop is {{designed}} to allow enough leverage {{for it to be}} accelerated rapidly with <b>a</b> controlled <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrist without causing the rider balancing problems. Thus, a true crop is relatively short.|$|R
60|$|A {{squirrel}} {{ran up and}} sat {{begging for}} a nut. Betty searched in the grass {{in the hope of}} finding one, but came upon nothing but shells. The squirrel bounded away, with <b>a</b> disdainful <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the tail.|$|R
5000|$|While running, {{push the}} ball firmly {{to the ground}} around 1.5-2m in front of them, angling the ball {{slightly}} with <b>a</b> quick <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrist, so that it strikes the ground towards the end furthest from the player's body, tilted slightly downward.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} one cord (called the {{retention}} cord) a finger-loop is formed. At the end of the other cord (the release cord,) it is a common practice to form a knot or a tab. The release cord will be held between finger and thumb to be released at just the right moment, and may have a complex braid to add bulk to the end. This makes the knot easier to hold, and the extra weight allows the loose end of a discharged sling to be recovered with <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrist.|$|E
25|$|The {{pivoting}} {{part that}} supports the cylinder is called the crane; it is the weak point of swing-out cylinder designs. Using the method often portrayed in movies and television of flipping the cylinder open and closed with <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrist can in fact cause the crane to bend over time, throwing the cylinder out of alignment with the barrel. Lack of alignment between chamber and barrel is a dangerous condition, as it can impede the bullet's transition from chamber to barrel. This gives rise to higher pressures in the chamber, bullet damage, {{and the potential for}} an explosion if the bullet becomes stuck.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} some {{specialised}} passes {{that can be used}} during a rugby game. The 'dive-pass' is a pass which is sometimes used by the scrum-half if they are unable to get into the correct position for a long pass. The player dives as they release the ball, resulting in a quick pass. A 'flick-pass' is similar to a standard pass except the ball is passed with <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrists, making it a faster pass but with less distance. The 'pop-pass' is a short pass where the ball is simply popped up in a small loop to a player. The 'gut-pass' is a pass straight into the stomach area of a player and is mostly used by the forwards when moving the ball back through a maul.|$|E
50|$|The {{mourning}} collared dove's {{flight is}} quick, with the regular beats and <b>an</b> occasional sharp <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wings which {{are characteristic of}} pigeons in general.|$|R
60|$|She {{submitted}} prettily. Then, when {{he let her}} go, {{she began}} to skip, with <b>a</b> curious <b>flicking</b> up <b>of</b> one leg behind her.|$|R
50|$|Soukou is {{the leader}} of the Taiten- Gyoudou. He is {{extremely}} gentle, but extremely strong as well. He sends Taisou flying with <b>a</b> single <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> his finger. It is later revealed that his eyes have the power of the stars as well. Taisou follows this man rather blindly.|$|R
500|$|Graham {{became the}} Browns' uncontested leader, {{but he was}} also [...] "just one of the guys", tackle Mike McCormack said in 1999. [...] "He was not aloof, which {{you see a lot of}} times today." [...] He was good at {{spinning}} and moving in the pocket, skills he learned playing basketball. In his autobiography, Paul Brown praised Graham's ability to anticipate his receivers' route-running by watching their shoulders. [...] "I remember his tremendous peripheral vision and his great athletic skill, as well as his ability to throw a football far and accurately with just <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> his arm", Brown said. His short passes were hard and accurate, teammates later said, and his long balls were soft. [...] "I used to catch a lot of them one-handed", Lavelli said. [...] "He had great touch in his hands." [...] He was nicknamed [...] "Automatic Otto" [...] for his consistency and toughness.|$|E
500|$|... "I sneaked {{up there}} a few times. And under the bright, unforgiving lights of television, I was able to {{encounter}} the real Michelangelo. I {{was so close to}} him I could see the bristles from his brushes caught in the paint; and the mucky thumbprints he'd left along his margins. The first thing that impressed me was his speed. Michelangelo worked at Schumacher pace. Adam's famous little penis was captured with a single brushstroke: <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrist, and the first man had his manhood. I also enjoyed his sense of humour, which, from close up, turned out to be refreshingly puerile. If you look closely at the angels who attend the scary prophetess on the Sistine ceiling known as the Cumaean Sibyl, you will see that one of them has stuck his thumb between his fingers in that mysteriously obscene gesture that visiting fans are still treated to today at Italian football matches." ...|$|E
500|$|Traditional {{means of}} capture varied across the birds' range and nets and rods {{were used in}} various ingenious ways. A typical device used in the Faroes was a [...] "fleyg". This was a long pole with a net on the end laid flat on the ground. A few dead puffins were strewn around to entice {{incoming}} birds to land, and the net was flicked upwards to scoop a bird from the air as it slowed before alighting. Most of the birds caught were sub-adults, and a skilled hunter could gather two or three hundred in a day. Another method of capture, used in St Kilda, involved {{the use of a}} flexible pole with a noose on the end. This was pushed along the ground towards the intended target, which advanced to inspect the noose as its curiosity overcame its caution. <b>A</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrist would flip the noose over the victim's head and it was promptly killed, before its struggles could alarm other birds nearby.|$|E
50|$|The {{flight of}} the pigeon is fast and direct, with the regular beats and <b>an</b> {{occasional}} sharp <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general.|$|R
50|$|He {{scored a}} {{goal in the}} final of the 2013 Donegal Senior Football Championship {{following}} <b>a</b> deft <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the heel from Michael Murphy. That was Bonner's second Donegal Senior Football Championship. Bonner's team progressed to {{the final of the}} Ulster Senior Club Football Championship, which they lost to Ballinderry.|$|R
5000|$|The Zune Pad, {{which is}} a squircle, is the primary control [...] for Zune 4, 8, 16, 80 and 120. The pad lets users of this device scroll through {{a long list of}} songs with <b>a</b> few <b>flicks</b> <b>of</b> the finger, then press the button to select tracks or change the volume.|$|R
500|$|The {{common toad}} usually moves by walking rather slowly or in short {{shuffling}} jumps involving all four legs. It spends the day concealed in a lair {{that it has}} hollowed out under foliage or beneath a root or a stone where its colouring makes it inconspicuous. It emerges at dusk and may travel some distance in the dark while hunting. It is most active in wet weather. By morning it has returned to its base and may occupy the same place for several months. It is voracious and eats woodlice, slugs, beetles, caterpillars, flies, earthworms and even small mice. Small, fast moving prey may be caught by <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the tongue while larger items are grabbed with the jaws. Having no teeth, it swallows food whole {{in a series of}} gulps. It does not recognise its prey as such but will try to consume any small, dark coloured, moving object it encounters at night. A research study showed that it would snap at a moving [...] piece of black paper as if it were prey but would disregard a larger moving piece. Toads seem to use visual cues for feeding and can see their prey at very low light intensities where humans are unable to discern anything. Periodically, the common toad sheds its skin. This comes away in tattered pieces and is then consumed.|$|E
2500|$|Van Halen {{has used}} a Steinberger GL-2T guitar with TransTrem on several songs, {{including}} [...] "Get Up" [...] and [...] "Summer Nights" [...] (from 5150). It was custom painted with the [...] "Frankenstrat" [...] graphics. He has also used Kramer and Peavey model guitars fitted with the Steinberger TransTrem unit. The Steinbeger {{is able to}} change the tuning of a guitar with <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> a switch {{and be able to}} lock it there.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "The Eleventh Hour", the {{malfunctioning}} sonic screwdriver {{is destroyed}} when the Doctor tries {{to signal the}} Atraxi ships. The Doctor later receives a new one, which emerges from the newly regenerated TARDIS console. The Eleventh Doctor's sonic screwdriver is larger than its predecessor; it has a green light and metal claws that extend with <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrist. It is shown to have been created by the TARDIS {{as part of its}} automatic regeneration.|$|E
50|$|Adult Agrias live in {{the forest}} canopy, {{occasionally}} visiting the forest floor to feed on decomposing fruit. The butterflies always feed and rest with their wings closed, but if disturbed they may give <b>a</b> rapid <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wings, displaying the vivid colours of the upperside. Males establish territories and perch on tree trunks, branches, and even the ground.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where {{you went}} wrong there," [...] said George, [...] "was {{that you made}} the stroke a sudden heave instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smooth, snappy <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrists. Pressing is always bad, but with the mashie----" ...|$|R
50|$|In a few jurisdictions, such as Colorado and New York City, {{courts have}} {{periodically}} attempted to classify ordinary lock-blade folding knives with a blade {{that may be}} opened by centrifugal force (normally, using <b>a</b> <b>flicking</b> motion <b>of</b> the wrist) as a gravity knife, thus making the knife's owner {{subject to the same}} criminal penalties imposed for illegal possession of a gravity knife.|$|R
2500|$|Never have I been {{so deeply}} touched on a cricket ground {{as in this}} heavenly summer, when I went to Lord's to see a pale-faced crowd, {{existing}} on rations, the rocket-bomb still in the ears of most, and see the strain of anxiety and affliction passed from all hearts and shoulders {{at the sight of}} Compton in full sail ... each stroke <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> delight, a propulsion of happy, sane, healthy life. There were no rations in an innings by Compton.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2011, Stephen Fry's 100 Greatest Gadgets {{was shown}} on Channel 4 {{as one of}} the 100 Greatest strand. His choice for the {{greatest}} gadget was the cigarette lighter, which he described as [...] "fire with <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the fingers". In the same month, the nature documentary series Ocean Giants, narrated by Fry, premiered. In September 2011, Fry's Planet Word, a five-part documentary about language, aired on BBC HD and BBC Two. In November 2011, an episode of Living The Life featured Fry in an intimate conversation discussing his life and career with Rolling Stones bass player Bill Wyman.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few days}} before his death, in a final statement, he {{declared}} that nobody among either his associates or the general public had understood {{what had happened to}} him (as the conduit of the teaching). He added that the [...] "supreme intelligence" [...] operating in his body would be gone with his death, again implying the impossibility of successors. However, [...] he stated that people could perhaps get into touch with that somewhat [...] "if they live the teachings". In prior discussions, he had compared himself with Thomas Edison, implying that he did the hard work, and now all that was needed by others was <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the switch.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{very popular}} {{activity}} called Shagaa is the [...] "flicking" [...] of sheep ankle bones at a target several feet away, using <b>a</b> <b>flicking</b> motion <b>of</b> the finger {{to send the}} small bone flying at targets and trying to knock the target bones off the platform. At Naadam, this contest is very popular and develops a serious audience among older Mongolians.|$|R
50|$|Research {{indicates}} a fluctuation in point-of-sale demand of +/- five percent will be interpreted by supply chain participants as {{a change in}} demand of up to +/- forty percent. Much like cracking a whip, <b>a</b> small <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrist (<b>a</b> shift in point of sale demand) can cause a large motion {{at the end of}} the whip (manufacturer's response).|$|R
50|$|This species {{builds a}} stick nest {{in a tree}} and lays two white eggs. Its flight is quick, with the regular beats and <b>an</b> {{occasional}} sharp <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general.|$|R
