Ted Strong of the Intertribal Fish Commission told one historian, [...] "If {{you are an}} Indian person <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>you</b> can still see all the characteristics of that waterfall.

60|$|Let us have it down {{in black}} and white at the first go off, so that there may be no unpleasantness or wrangling afterwards. And this is looked over by a friend of mine, a ticket writer, that is up to literature. I am a young man in the Art line--in the Fine-Art line. You have seen my works over and over again, and you have been curious about me, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have seen me.

I am old enough to speak for myself, and I am my own master.

When I want all the {{strength}} I can get to lean on: something iron, something stony, I don't care how cruel it is, you go all mushy and want to slobber over me. I'm not angry; I'm not unfriendly; but for God's sake do pull yourself together; and don't think that because you're on velvet and always have been, women who are in hell can take it as easily as you.|$|E

It has a last dip and slide in its character, has Calais, to be especially commanded to the infernal gods.

6000|$|He easily {{found it}} {{for himself in}} the place which is called the Herder Platz after it. He went into the Peter and Paul Church there; where Herder used to preach sermons, {{sometimes}} not at all liked by the nobility and gentry for their revolutionary tendency; the sovereign was shielded from the worst effects of his doctrine by worshipping apart from other sinners in a glazed gallery. Herder is buried in the church, and when you ask where, the sacristan lifts a wooden trap-door in the pavement, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are going down into the crypt, but you are only to see Herder's monumental stone, which is kept covered so to save it from passing feet. Here also is the greatest picture of that great soul Luke Kranach, who had sincerity enough in his paining to atone for all the swelling German sculptures in the world. It is a crucifixion, and the cross is of a white birch log, such as might have been {{cut out of the}} Weimar woods, shaved smooth on the sides, with the bark showing at the edges. Kranach has put himself among the spectators, and a stream of blood {{from the side of the}} Savior falls in baptism upon the painter's head. He is in the company of John the Baptist and Martin Luther; Luther stands with his Bible open, and his finger on the line, [...] "The blood of Jesus cleanseth us." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{yet this}} man has his romance, his high poetic feeling, and above all his manly dignity. Visit him, {{and you will find}} him without coat or waistcoat, unshorn, in ragged blue trowsers and old flannel shirt, too often bearing on his lantern jaws the signs of ague and sickness; but he will stand upright before you and speak to you with all the ease of a {{lettered}} gentleman in his own library. All the odious incivility of the republican servant has been banished. He is his own master, standing on his own threshold, and finds no need to assert his equality by rudeness. He is delighted to see you, and bids you sit down on his battered bench without dreaming of any such apology as an English cottier offers to a Lady Bountiful when she calls. He has worked out his independence, and shows it in every easy movement of his body. He tells you of it unconsciously in every tone of his voice. You will always find in his cabin some newspaper, some book, some token of advance in education. When he questions you about the old country he astonishes you by the extent of his knowledge. I defy you not to feel that he is superior to the race from whence he has sprung in England or in Ireland. To me I confess that the manliness of such a man is very charming. He is dirty, and, perhaps, squalid. His children are sick and he is without comforts. His wife is pale, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> see shortness of life written in the faces of all the family. But over and above it all there is an independence which sits gracefully on their shoulders, and teaches you at the first glance that the man has a right to assume himself to be your equal. It is for this position that the laborer works, bearing hard words and the indignity of tyranny; suffering also too often the dishonest ill usage which his superior power enables the master to inflict.|$|E
