40|$|The Internet {{presents}} {{unique and}} growing opportunities for conducting HIV/ STD research. This article {{reports on the}} first 171 participants enrolled in an ongoing study examining use of the Internet to recruit Hispanic {{men who have sex}} with men (HMSM) living in an AIDS epicenter to participate in community-based studies. First, it describes initial success with chatroom recruitment. Second, it compares the demographic, psychosocial, and sexual risk practices among HMSM recruited through the Internet who had used club drugs in the last 6 months and those who had not. In 2 months, 211 hours were spent recruiting in chatrooms; 735 chatroom users were engaged. Researchers used a scripted dialogue to describe the study and to invite chatroom users to visit the study’s community sites for screening and enrollment. One hundred and seventy-six men came to the community sites; 172 (98 %) were eligible and completed an audio-computer assisted self-interview. In the last 6 months, 48. 5 % of the sample had used club drugs [defined as cocaine, crystal methamphetamines (crystal), <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrites</b> (poppers), Ecstasy, gammahydroxybutyrate (GHB), ketamine (Special K), and Viagra]. The proportion of men reporting use of each drug was: cocaine (15. 8 %), crystal (11. 7 %), poppers (31. 6 %), Ecstasy (14 %), GHB (3. 5 %), Special K (3. 5 %), and Viagra (19. 3 %). In multivariate analyses, having higher number of sex partners, having higher social isolation scores, and having engaged in unprotected receptive anal intercourse were significantly associated with club-drug use. These initial findings suggest that high-risk HMSM can be successfully recruited through chatroom dialogues to participate in community-based HIV studies. The alarmingly high rates of club-drug use and risky sexual practices among HMSM underscore the need for effective HIV preventive interventions for this population...|$|E

40|$|Inhalants are {{a diverse}} group of {{volatile}} substances whose chemical vapors can be inhaled to produce psychoactive (mind-altering) effects. While other abused substances can be inhaled, the term “inhalants ” is used to describe substances that are rarely, if ever, taken by any other route of administration. A variety of products common in the home and workplace contain substances that can be inhaled to get high; however, people do not typically think of these products (e. g., spray paints, glues, and cleaning fluids) as drugs because they were never intended to induce intoxicating effects. Yet young children and adolescents can easily obtain these extremely toxic substances, and are among those most likely to abuse them. In fact, more 8 th graders have tried inhalants than any other illicit drug. 1 What Types of Products are Abused as Inhalants? Inhalants generally fall into the following categories: Volatile solvents—liquids that vaporize at room temperature Industrial or household products, including paint thinners or removers, degreasers, dry-cleaning fluids, gasoline, lighter fluid Art or office supply solvents, including correction fluids, felt-tip marker fluid, electronic contact cleaners, glue Aerosols—sprays that contain propellants and solvents Household aerosol propellants in items such as spray paints, hair or deodorant sprays, fabric protector sprays, aerosol computer cleaning products, and vegetable oil sprays Gases—found in household or commercial products and used as medical anesthetics Household or commercial products, including butane lighters and propane tanks, whipped cream aerosols or dispensers (whippets), and refrigerant gases Medical anesthetics, such as ether, chloroform, halothane, and nitrous oxide (“laughing gas”) Nitrites—a special class of inhalants that are used primarily as sexual enhancers Organic nitrites are volatiles that include cyclohexyl, butyl, and <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrites,</b> commonly known as “poppers. ” Amyl nitrite is still used in certain diagnostic medical procedures.

40|$|Definition: Although other abused {{drugs can}} be inhaled, the term inhalants is {{reserved}} for {{the wide variety of}} substances—including solvents, aerosols, gases, and nitrites—that are rarely, if ever, taken via any other route of administration. (See below for a list of examples.) Many products readily found in the home or workplace—such as spray paints, markers, glues, and cleaning fluids—contain volatile substances that have psychoactive (mind-altering) properties when inhaled. People do not typically think of these products as drugs because they were never intended for that purpose. However, these products are sometimes abused in that way. They are especially (but not exclusively) abused by young children and adolescents, and are the only class of substance abused more by younger than by older teens. How Are Inhalants Abused? Abusers of inhalants breathe them in through the nose or mouth {{in a variety of ways}} (known as “huffing”). They may sniff or snort fumes from a container or dispenser (such as a glue bottle or a marking pen), spray aerosols (such as computer cleaning dusters) directly into their nose or mouth, or place a chemical-soaked rag in their mouth. Abusers may also inhale fumes from a balloon or a plastic or paper bag. Although the high produced by inhalants usually lasts just a few minutes, abusers often try to prolong it by continuing to inhale repeatedly over several hours. People tend to abuse different inhalant products at different ages. New users ages 12 – 15 most commonly abuse glue, shoe polish, spray paints, gasoline, and lighter fluid. New users ages 16 – 17 most commonly abuse nitrous oxide or “whippets. ” Adults most commonly abuse a class of inhalants known as nitrites (such as <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrites</b> or “poppers”). How Do Inhalants Affect the Brain? Most abused inhalants other than nitrites depress the central nervous system in a manner not unlike alcohol. The effects are similar—including slurred speech, lack of coordination, euphoria, and dizziness. Inhalant abusers may also experience light-headedness, hallucinations, and delu-sions. With repeated inhalations, many users feel less inhibited and less in control. Some may feel drowsy for several hours and experience a lingering headache. Unlike other types of inhalants, nitrites enhance sexual pleasure by dilating and relaxing blood vessels. Although it is not very common, addiction to inhalants can occur with repeated abuse What Are the Other Health Effects of Inhalants Chemicals found in different types of inhaled products may produce a vari-ety of other short-term effects, such as nausea or vomiting, as well as more serious long-term consequences. These may include liver and kidney damage, hearing loss, or bone marrow damage. Effects may also include loss of coordination and limb spasms due to damage to myelin—a protective sheathing around nerve fibers that helps nerves transmit messages in the brain and peripheral nervous system. Inhalants can also cause brain damage by cutting off oxygen flow to the brain. Inhalants can even be lethal. Sniffing highly concentrated amounts of the chemicals in solvents or aerosol sprays can directly cause heart failure within minutes. This syndrome, known as “sudden sniffing death,” can result from a single session of inhalant use by an otherwise healthy young person. High concentrations of inhal-ants may also cause death from suffocation, especially when inhaled from a paper or plastic bag or in a closed area. Even when using aerosols or volatile products for their legitimate purposes like painting or cleaning, it is wise to do so in a well-ventilated room or outdoors. Nitrites are a special class of inhalants that are abused to enhance sexual pleasure and performance. They can be associated with unsafe sexual practices that increase the risk of contracting and spreading infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 03 Background: In Peru, the HIV {{epidemic}} is concentrated among {{men who have}} sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) in whom HIV incidence rates are as high as 4. 2 per 100 person-years with HIV prevalence reported to be as high as 22 % in MSM and up to 30 % in TGW. This dissertation seeks to add to the knowledge of the structure of sexual networks, namely the level and predictors of sexual concurrency among MSM and TGW in Peru (Aim 1), and the understanding of risk factors for HIV acquisition in MSM and TGW with high levels of substance use in Lima (Aim 2). Methods: Data are from the 2011 Peruvian Biobehavioral Surveillance survey (Aim 1) and the Sabes cohort study conducted in Lima from 2013 - 2016 (Aim 2). Data were collected with the computer assisted self-interview (CASI) (Aim 1 & 2); HIV testing was performed with Determine 1 / 2 rapid antibody tests (Aim 1 & 2), pooled nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), and Western Blot to determine Fiebig Stage at HIV diagnosis. Statistical methods used include Poisson regression and generalized estimating equations (GEE) (Aim 1), and Pearson’s Chi-square, Poisson regression estimated with GEE, and stratified Cox proportional hazards survival analysis with time-varying covariates (Aim 2). Results: Concurrency is a common practice among MSM and TGW in Peru with a 3 -month cumulative prevalence of over 23 %. There was evidence of negotiated safety—those with a stable partner were less likely to have condomless anal intercourse (CLAI) with a concurrent non-stable partner. In the Sabes cohort, HIV incidence was 11. 7 per 100 person-years of follow-up. Those with alcohol use disorders (AUD) were significantly more likely to attend a venue that served alcohol, binge drink, and use marijuana or <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrites.</b> AUD modified the association between the time-varying behavioral factors and HIV; behavioral risk factors (binge drinking, marijuana use, sex with a casual partner, client, or one-time partner) were most strongly associated with HIV acquisition amongst those with dependent drinking patterns. Conclusion: This study suggests that AUD is linked to HIV risk in two important ways: first, through CLAI with non-stable partners and second, through amplifying the impact of other HIV risk behaviors. These studies suggest that harm reduction approaches, such as negotiated safety with concurrent partners, and treatment of AUDs to decrease alcohol intake could decrease the HIV risk associated with these behaviors...|$|E

Four patients with holosystolic mitral valve prolapse on echocardiogram had smaller resting end-diastolic volumes than the remaining 17 patients with late systolic echocardiographic prolapse (P < 0. 01). Thirteen of the 17 patients with late systolic prolapse had phonocardiographically recorded auscultatory phenomena. The initial vibrations of the auscultatory phenomena occurred after the onset of echocardiographic prolapse, but prior to maximal echocardiographic mitral valve prolapse. <b>Amyl</b> <b>nitrite</b> was administered to all patients. Three of the 17 patients with late systolic prolapse developed holosystolic prolapse, while the remaining 14 retained the late systolic prolapse pattern during <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrite</b> inhalation.
