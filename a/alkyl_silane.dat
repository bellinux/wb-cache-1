40|$|The {{spatial control}} of {{cellular}} adhesion {{is fundamental to}} the development of studies of cell interaction, cellular microarrays, and cell based biosensors. The ability to pattern cell adhesion on flat substrates and in microfluidic channels is important for locating cell near microdetectors in cell based biosensor devices. Cell adhesion can be controlled by patterning a material 2 ̆ 7 s wettability, as cells are able to adhere to hydrophilic surface and will generally avoid hydrophobic materials. This thesis focuses on patterning the surface wettability of poly(dimethylsilox-ane) (PDMS) in order to spatially control cell adhesion. The polymer is selectively modifed by the deposition of aluminum through a stencil mask in a magnetron sputtering system. After etching away the aluminum layer, a hydrophilic oxygen rich silica-like layer is exposed. This technique permits the creation of hydrophilic dots which are surrounded by the hydrophobic native PDMS. A second technique involving the use of photolithography results in a surface that can undergo hydrophobic recovery. By contrast, the selected areas covered by aluminum are protected against hydrophobic recovery. Finally, photolithography is used to selectively react a methyl terminated <b>alkyl</b> <b>silane</b> with the modified surface. Each surface modification was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectros-copy, atomic force microscopy, contact angle measurements, force distance curves, cell attachment and viability tests; the effectiveness of the techniques to pattern wettability and cell adhesion was assessed. The relative adsorption of fibronectin and fibrinogen was visualized on the patterned surface. Further, the relative availability of the cell binding sites were also visualized on the surface through immunofluorescent labeling. While all patterning methods were effective at controlling surface wettability, cells did not show any selectivity on the surfaces patterned for hydrophobic recovery. The use of an <b>alkyl</b> <b>silane</b> proved more effective, as cell attachment did show some selectivity. However, cells were able to adhere and grow on the hydrophobic silanized regions. The stencil mask patterned surfaces showed cell selectivity, with cells almost completely avoiding the native hydrophobic PDMS background. Overall, the stencil mask patterning technique proved to be the most effective at controlling cell adhesion. Thus this surface patterning technique was integrated into reversibly and irreversible sealed microfluidic channels...|$|E

Improved knowledge on the material {{composition of}} paint layers on heritage items will allow {{a better understanding of}} the painting technique used by the authors, will contribute to the characterization assignment and authentication of artworks, and sustainable conservation of the heritage objects. This thesis presents a research related to the characterization and physical chemical properties of organic materials used in paint layers both from natural and synthetic origin. Organic materials can be used in painted surfaces for different purposes: as adhesives, when joining together two surfaces; as binging media, if applied in order to assure cohesion in a paint layer; as consolidant if used to return the lost coherence a paint layer; as varnish or protective layer or coatings of the painted surfaces. In this thesis we focus our attention on proteinaceous materials used as binders in tempera paint layers, their interaction with coloured pigments and their ageing behavior, and on alkyd resins used in modern and contemporary art; in particular synthetic resin produced by the Winsor & Newton, Series Griffin – fast drying oil colour were considered. Two formulations of siloxanes produced by Caparol (Disboxan 450) and Phase Restauro (Hydrophase) to be used as protective coatings were studied as well. Analysis were performed by using several techniques with a particular focus on thermoanalytical ones. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), thermogravimetric and evolved gas analysis coupled with Fourier infrared spectroscopy (TG-EGA-FTIR), and Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) on the solid samples enabled the characterization of the chemical physical behavior of the paint layer components. The first chapter of the thesis introduces the different organic materials studied, natural and synthetic, in particular proteins, proteinaceous materials and alkyd resins. The second chapter presents the technical aspects of sampling giving an overview of the methods used for binding media and resins analysis (TGA, TG-FTIR, FTIR and DSC) revealing advantages and limits for each of them. Beginning from the third chapter the thesis presents the analysis of the material studied. The pure pigments (natural or synthetic) used in proteinaceous and alkyd binders, and filler are characterized by TGA and FTIR. The fourth chapter studies the proteinaceous binder (ovalbumin, casein and rabbit glue), their interaction with five different inorganic pigments (azurite, red ochre, calcium carbonate, cinnabar and minium) and the effect of artificial UV-ageing. The fifth chapter studies the alkyd resins produced by the Winsor & Newton- series Griffin- Fast drying oil colour and their interaction with ten different pigments, organic (arylamide yellow, phthalocyanine, naphtol carbamide) and inorganic (cadmium-zinc sulphide, chromium oxide and sulphoselenide, aluminium-silicate of sodium, titanium dioxide and bone black), the effect of natural ageing of 8 months and of artificial ageing with acetic acid. The sixth chapter studies the silane/siloxane coatings, in particular <b>alkyl</b> <b>silane</b> and alkyl-alkoxy siloxane, their characterization, their ageing after two years of natural outdoor ageing and their interactions with acrylic colour. These two formulations of coatings are produced by Caparol (Disboxan 450) and Phase Restauro (Hydrophase) and the selected product will be applied on the wall painting “Tuttomondo” of Keith Haring on the Church of Sant’ Antonio in Pisa...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{studies have}} focused on the {{development}} of new materials for the control, treatment, and long term storage of hazardous metals. The process involves the introduction of hazardous cations into the matrix of clays through aqueous ion-exchange methods. These cations are subsequently encapsulated within the clay by treating the material with a variety of organic silanes. This treatment results in the formation of organic coatings which are chemically bonded {{to the surface of the}} clay. The coatings are hydrophobic in nature, and may restrict the diffusion of water into and out of the pores contained within the clay. The goal of this process is to reduce the undesirable migration of hazardous metals from the ion-exchanged clays into the environment. A smectic type clay, bentonite, has been the primary inorganic matrix for this study. Bentonite, which is a form of montmorillonite, consists of two-dimensional sheets of aluminosilicates. Like other smectite clays, these sheets are separated by an interlayer which contains cations and water. The reactive groups within the <b>alkyl</b> <b>silanes</b> react with hydroxyl groups on the clay surface, as well as water contained on and within the clay. The authors results show that there is little difference in the metal content of the coated and noncoated clays. The cations are not removed from the clay by exposure to the silane. The clays also maintain their general structure and cystallinity upon surface modification. The organic coatings are stable to 500 {degrees}C when heated under nitrogen. The ability of these systems to encapsulate the cations and prevent their migration into the environment is currently being evaluated...|$|R
30|$|Electroplating [29], {{electrodeposition}} [32] {{and chemical}} etching [33] {{methods have been}} used to construct microscale or nanoscale rough structures, but to reduce surface energy, these methods require modifying reagents such as fluorine-containing <b>silanes,</b> <b>alkyl</b> mercaptans and lauric acid, which are harmful to the environment; the modified filter membranes may cause secondary pollution to water. Therefore, chemical surface modification is advantageous as it provides low surface energy following environmentally friendly procedures.|$|R
40|$|The {{protective}} {{performances of}} different coatings for AZ 31 Mg alloy {{have been evaluated}} in 0. 1 N NaCl and Na 2 SO 4 solutions by recording the polarization curves and by EIS measurements. These coatings were formed in permanganate-phosphate or stannate baths {{as well as in}} hydroalcoholic solutions of silanes with a long alkyl-chain (e. g. octyl and octadecyl-trimethoxy-silane). The influence of different parameters (solution pH, treatment time) were examined and the possibility to increase the permanganate coating performance with a subsequent treatment in water-soluble silanes was also evaluated. All the treatments with inorganic compounds showed protective characteristics similar or better than those of chromate treatment. Furthermore, silanes may enhance the efficiency of permanganate bath. However, the best results were obtained with the 18 carbon atom long <b>alkyl</b> chain <b>silane</b> (hydrolyzed at pH 5). In this case no corrosion attack was observed in 1000 h immersion in the aggressive solutions...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} of {{applying}} hydrophobic coatings to cement-based materials based on {{exposure to the}} treatment vapour is proposed. The method is demonstrated {{for the application of}} monomeric <b>alkyl</b> (isobutyl) alkoxy <b>silane</b> to cement paste and mortar samples manufactured and cured under a variety of conditions. The efficacy of the treatment is compared to conventional flood coating using magnetic resonance imaging (specifically SPRITE) to monitor the time dependent uptake of water into treated samples. It is concluded that the method as proposed is of significant benefit for some of the samples...|$|R
