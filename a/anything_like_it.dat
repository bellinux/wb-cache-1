They were cheered by approximately 1 million supporters, with an estimated 300,000 fans located around St George's Hall – the final destination of the parade. Business experts estimated that one in five workers took time off following the victory. It was also estimated that Liverpudlians drank around 10,000 bottles of champagne after the match, with supermarket chain Sainsbury's stating: [...] "We've never seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> We would usually expect to sell this much champagne at Christmas".|$|E

500|$|In 1980, Ronald Reagan {{was elected}} President, {{with a plan}} to rebuild the US {{military}} as a counter to the increasing military power of the Soviet Union as one of his benchmark commitments. At the time, the Soviet Navy {{was in the process of}} commissioning a class of missile cruiser the like of which had not been seen for decades [...] the Kirov class was the largest type of surface warship (other than aircraft carriers or amphibious assault vessels) built since World War II, and the US had not envisioned building <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> As a consequence, as part of Reagan's 600-ship Navy policy and to act as a counter to the Kirov class, the US Navy began the process of reactivating the four Iowa-class units and modernizing them for service in the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, John Calvert {{stated that}} [...] "timing" [...] {{is the reason}} why a grunge revival did not happen; he says that the {{cultural}} mood of the late 1980s and early 1990s, which inspired the movement, were no longer present. Seattle songwriter Jeff Stetson states that people from the 2010s who are listening to grunge should learn about the [...] "...context and history of how it all came to be" [...] and [...] "...respect for what a truly amazing thing it was that happened here [...] because you probably won't see <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> again."

No one had heard <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> before. In the twenty years since then, people have got more desensitized. What was over the top then might not be now." [...] Drummer Paul Bostaph who was a Slayer member from 1992 to 2001 (and 2013–present) first heard the record {{when he was a}} member of Forbidden. During a party Bostaph walked towards music he heard from another room, and approached Forbidden guitarist Craig Locicero. When asked what music was playing, Locicero shouted [...] "the new Slayer record". After listening closely to the record, he looked at Locicero, and concluded that his band was [...] "fucked".|$|E

500|$|The next day, King Charles and {{his brother}} Henry {{took part in a}} tournament, leading teams dressed as British and Irish knights. The theme of the tournament, [...] "virtue and love", was {{represented}} by two chariots, one containing ladies dressed as the five virtues, the other carrying Venus and Cupid and many mini-cupids. In the tournament itself, little balls of fire were lobbed among the horses as they crossed. The royal grandstand was hung with gold-and-silk tapestries illustrating the triumph of Scipio, which Giulio Romano had designed for Francis I. Brantôme recalled in his memoirs that [...] "the Spanish lords and ladies greatly admired it, never having seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> in the possession of their king".

500|$|Grimm connects Eddic {{references}} to Sif's golden hair (gold {{is referred to}} as Sifjar haddr; Sif's hair) with the herb name haddr Sifjar (polytrichum aureum). Grimm says that [...] "expositors see in this the [...] golden fruits of the Earth burnt up by fire and growing again, they liken Sif to Ceres", and Grimm says that [...] "with it agrees the fact that O. Slav. Siva is a gloss on 'Ceres dea frumenti'" [...] but cites etymological problems between the potential cognate. Grimm says that Thor's mother was the earth, and not his wife, yet [...] "we do find the simple Sif standing for earth." [...] Grimm adds that he is inconclusive regarding Sif and that, [...] "we ought to have fuller details about Sif, and these are wholly wanting in our mythology. Nowhere amongst us is the mystic relation of the seed-corn of Demeter, whose poignant grief for her daughter threatens to bring famine on mankind (Hymn to Cer. 305–306), nor <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> recorded." ...|$|E

[...] "She was a cute, curly-haired young woman wearing a shift and sandals. I remember she had this satchel, a backpack— I'd never seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> Or her", Lyon remembered. At her first meeting of the Daughters of Bilitis in someone's living room, Gittings brought up the obscurity of the name, which she thought was impractical, difficult to pronounce and spell, and referenced a fictional bisexual character, not even homosexual. [...] "Even then I was pretty assertive...What were they doing with a name like that? It wasn't very nice of me, but they seemed to take it with reasonably good spirits." ...|$|E

500|$|Though {{the group}} have {{generally}} been commercially unsuccessful outside of early 1970s Italy, they have inspired several notable musicians, including Rush, John Lydon, Marc Almond, Graham Coxon, Luca Prodan, Mark E. Smith, John Frusciante, Bruce Dickinson and Julian Cope. Dickinson, {{who has been a}} fan of the band since he saw them at Oundle School aged 13, said that Hammill was one of his childhood heroes. Coxon is particularly fond of [...] "House with No Door" [...] from H to He (1970), saying the track is [...] "extremely beautiful, with Jackson's truly lovely sax-and-flute instrumental section." [...] Almond recalled hearing [...] "Killer" [...] for the first time saying, [...] "I'd never heard <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> before. It wasn't just Peter's snarling operatic vocal, it was the mix of instruments... I became an instant fan." [...] Mentioning their reputation as something of an acquired taste, Lydon said, [...] "There's a few Van Der Graaf things I like, but I'm not going to recommend anything to anyone. It might not be for them. Music doesn't come with a set of guidelines." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Crosby {{insisted upon}} the {{inclusion}} of the contentious track [...] "Mind Gardens", which was disliked by the other band members and derided by McGuinn as having no [...] "rhythm, meter, or rhyme". [...] In conversation with Byrds biographer Johnny Rogan in 1980, Crosby defended the song by stating [...] "it was unusual and not everybody could understand it because they'd never heard <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> before. At that time everything was supposed to have rhyme and have rhythm. And it neither rhymed nor had rhythm, so it was outside of their experience. It was just a little story and what it said was true ... if you build walls around your mind to keep out the abuse and harshness of life and the pain, then you also shut out the joy and the love." [...] Although [...] "Mind Gardens" [...] is often dismissed by critics and fans for being self-indulgent, Rogan has noted that its raga rock ambiance, symbolic lyrics and attractive backwards guitar effects capture the Byrds at their most creatively ambitious.|$|E
500|$|Dunn {{trained and}} rode his first World Grand Championship {{on the bay}} {{stallion}} Dark Spirit's Rebel. In 1991, the horse placed third in the competition. In 1992, the horse and rider pair won at most of the shows they had entered, including the World Grand Championship at that year's Celebration. Dunn had been training for 42 years at the time, and was 74 years old, making him the oldest trainer ever to win the class. The competition was held {{in front of a}} record crowd of 28,000. [...] "Rebel" [...] was the favorite horse going into the competition, out of a field of 13, and the team of Dunn and the stallion was described by the Florence TimesDaily as the [...] "most popular team in Celebration history". Dunn said after the win, [...] "I've been coming to the Celebration since 1950 and I've never seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> That made it twice as good. It's nice to know that I've got that many friends and supporters." [...] The following year, Dark Spirit's Rebel was retired from competition in a formal ceremony at the Celebration.

500|$|In the United Kingdom, it {{is legal}} to possess a bat'leth on private property; however, they may be seized if they are {{considered}} to be [...] "potential evidence of a criminal lifestyle." [...] They are classed as weapons, which makes it illegal to carry one in a public place. A replica bat'leth was surrendered to Gloucestershire Constabulary as part of the 2006 knife amnesty in the UK. In 2008, a miniature bat'leth was seized in Oxford after a 17-year-old was caught trying to smuggle it into a College. Police described the weapon as [...] "most horrendous". The person was arrested and sentenced to six months in a young offenders' institution. In 2009, a man from Billingham, County Durham, was arrested for possession of a miniature bat'leth in a public street. In the court documents, it was referred to as a [...] "multi-bladed sword", and the judge said [...] "I've never seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> in my life before." [...] The accused pleaded guilty at Teesside Crown Court, and he was later sentenced to thirteen weeks in prison. The court ordered that the bat'leth was to be forfeited and destroyed. A custom-made bat'leth was seized in 2009 in Accrington, Lancashire.|$|E
500|$|The Orb's {{members have}} drawn from an {{assortment}} of influences in their music. The Orb's central figure, Alex Paterson, had early musical tastes and influences which included King Tubby, Alice Cooper, Prince, Kraftwerk, and T.Rex. Among these, Paterson cites Kraftwerk {{as one of the}} most important, claiming they created the foundation from which all modern dance music has been built. While in Brixton with Martin Glover as a teenager, Paterson was also exposed to a large amount of reggae music, such as The Mighty Diamonds, The Abyssinians, and Bob Marley. The reggae influence on Paterson and the Orb can readily be heard in tracks such as the single [...] "Perpetual Dawn" [...] and U.F.Orbs [...] "Towers of Dub". The earliest ambient influences of the Orb came in 1979 during Paterson's roadie days with Killing Joke. While with the band in Neuss, Paterson listened to Brian Eno's Music for Films while on LSD and watched [...] "the Ruhr steel works explode in the distance", noting that [...] "he scene seemed to be taking place in the music as well". The same night, Paterson was also inspired while listening to Cluster's Grosses Wasser and found that the steel works' [...] "huge metal arms were crushing molten rocks in time to the music", which was something he'd [...] "never seen, or heard, <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> before". Along with Cluster and Kraftwerk, Paterson was also influenced by other German experimental music from Can and composer Karlheinz Stockhausen. Modulations calls Paterson's music a [...] "maximal" [...] version of Brian Eno's [...] "minimal" [...] ambience, though according to Paterson, Eno resents Paterson's use of his music as an influence.|$|E
500|$|Chandler {{had been}} {{dissatisfied}} with the sound quality at De Lane Lea, so he took the advice of Kit Lambert and booked time at CBS Studios. On December 13, 1966, after taking a five-week break from recording while they performed in Europe, the Experience reconvened at CBS. Assisted by engineer Mike Ross, the band were especially productive during the session, recording instrumentation and vocals for [...] "Foxy Lady" [...] and basic instrumental tracks for [...] "Love or Confusion", [...] "Can You See Me", and [...] "Third Stone from the Sun". Ross recalled the impact of Hendrix's Marshall stacks: [...] "It was so loud you couldn't stand in the studio... I'd never heard <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> in my life." [...] When Ross asked Hendrix where he would like the microphone placed Hendrix replied: [...] "Oh, man, just put a mic about twelve feet away {{on the other side}} of the studio. It'll sound great." [...] Ross agreed, and with a Neumann U87 tube mic he recorded Hendrix's guitar playing in a large room that, according to Ross, [...] "was absolutely vital to the uniquely powerful Experience sound." [...] Ross noted that input from Mitchell and Redding was minimized, and he asserted that Chandler was clearly [...] "the one in charge" [...] of the sessions. The band played together live at CBS; the lead and backup vocals were overdubbed. Despite his dwindling finances, Chandler encouraged the Experience to record numerous takes of a song, affording them the luxury of repeated attempts at a satisfactory recording. With a live instrument track as the foundation of the recordings, they eschewed the common practice of piecing together parts of several takes to make one continuous piece. After the December 13 recording session, the band made their television debut, on Britain's Ready Steady Go! ...|$|E

500|$|Despite Hammond's best attempts, McCabe {{was able}} to gain the strike and runs came quickly. McCabe reached his century in 140 minutes and England {{declined}} to take the new ball while he was batting. By lunch, he and Barnett had added 67 in only 50 minutes, although the latter had made only 20 of these; the total was 6/261, with McCabe on 105. Having reached his century, McCabe lifted his scoring rate, scoring his last 132 runs in 95 minutes. Boundaries came much more readily and he took 44 runs from a three over spell by leg spinner Doug Wright. As {{he ran out of}} partners, he became more aggressive; in the last ten overs of his innings, he took 80% of the strike and hit 16 boundaries. He was the last man out, attempting to loft the spin of Verity, after a final wicket partnership with Leslie Fleetwood-Smith of 77 in 28 minutes, of which he scored 72. He finished with 232 from 235 minutes with 34 boundaries and one six, an innings in which Bradman summoned his players not to miss a ball, as [...] "they would never see <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> again." [...] Bradman later said that McCabe [...] "held us all spellbound", and it was reported that the Australian captain trembled while watching the innings. While McCabe was at the crease, his partners contributed a total of only 58 runs, meaning that he had outscored them by a ratio of 4:1. Upon his return to the pavilion Bradman greeted him with the words: [...] "If I could play an innings like that, I'd be a proud man, Stan". This has also been reported as Bradman saying [...] " [...] I wish I could bat like that". Bradman later wrote that [...] "Towards the end [...] I could scarcely watch the play. My eyes filled as I drank in the glory of his shots". It was regarded by English captains Arthur Gilligan and Bob Wyatt to be the best innings that they had ever witnessed, as did former England bowler Sydney Barnesregarded {{as one of the best}} of all timewho said that he would not have been able to stop McCabe. [...] Neville Cardus said that the innings was one of the greatest in Test history. Wisden reported that McCabe played [...] "an innings the equal of which has probably never been seen in the history of Test cricket; for the best part of four hours he maintained a merciless punishment of the bowling". McCabe’s biographer Jack McHarg said that the innings “was a sort of encyclopedia of attacking batsmanship, a triumph of character, technique and judgement”. Cardus said ...|$|E
