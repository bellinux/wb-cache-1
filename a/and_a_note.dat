25|$|Paradise Lost is an epic poem in blank verse by the 17th-century English poet John Milton (1608–1674). The first version, {{published}} in 1667, consisted of ten books with over ten thousand lines of verse. A second edition followed in 1674, arranged into twelve books (in {{the manner of}} Virgil's Aeneid) with minor revisions throughout <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> on the versification. It is considered by critics to be Milton's major work, and it helped solidify his {{reputation as one of}} the greatest English poets of his time.|$|E
25|$|If two {{notes are}} {{simultaneously}} played, with frequency ratios that are simple fractions (e.g. 2/1, 3/2 or 5/4), the composite wave is still periodic, {{with a short}} period—and the combination sounds consonant. For instance, a note vibrating at 200Hz <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> vibrating at 300Hz (a perfect fifth, or 3/2 ratio, above 200Hz) add {{together to make a}} wave that repeats at 100Hz: every 1/100 of a second, the 300Hz wave repeats three times and the 200Hz wave repeats twice. Note that the total wave repeats at 100Hz, but there is no actual 100Hz sinusoidal component.|$|E

25|$|Judge Crater met Stella Mance Wheeler in 1917 when {{he served}} as her divorce lawyer, and they married seven days after her divorce was finalized.

Without Crater's income, Mrs. Crater was unable to maintain the couple's fashionable Fifth Avenue apartment and was evicted.

25|$|When Hastings tells Poirot {{that he saw}} Norton {{return to}} his room the night before, Poirot says it is flimsy evidence, not having seen the face: the dressing-gown, the hair, the limp, can all be imitated. Yet, there is no man in the house who could {{impersonate}} Norton, who was not tall. Poirot dies {{of a heart attack}} within hours. He leaves Hastings three clues: a copy of Othello, a copy of John Ferguson (a 1915 play by St. John Greer Ervine), <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> to speak to his longtime valet, Georges. After Poirot is buried at Styles, Hastings learns that Judith has all along been in love with Dr Franklin. She will marry him, and leave to do research in Africa. When Hastings speaks to Georges, he learns that Poirot wore a wig, and that Poirot's reasons for employing Curtiss were vague.|$|E

In return, the Nizam sent one horse, a piece of jewelery <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> warning the British that they had no right to mint their own currency, to which they complied.|$|E

25|$|No {{official}} {{announcement of}} the actor's death was made, only a brief obituary appeared in the Moscow newspaper Vechernyaya Moskva, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> informing of Vysotsky's death and cancellation of the Hamlet performance was put out {{at the entrance to}} the Taganka Theatre (the story goes that not a single ticket holder took advantage of the refund offer). Despite this, by the end of the day millions had learned of Vysotsky's death. On 28 July, he lay in state at the Taganka Theatre. After a mourning ceremony involving an unauthorized mass gathering of unprecedented scale, Vysotsky was buried at the Vagankovskoye Cemetery in Moscow. The attendance at the Olympic events dropped noticeably on that day, as scores of spectators left to attend the funeral. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of his coffin.|$|E
25|$|On 19 August 2012, at {{approximately}} 12:30pm. PDT, Scott died by suicide by jumping off the Vincent Thomas Bridge in the San Pedro port district of Los Angeles.

His body was recovered from the water by the Los Angeles Port Police. On 22 August, Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Ed Winters said the two notes Scott left behind made no mention of any health problems, but neither the police nor the family disclosed the content of those notes.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with the}} new {{management}} team, the sell-off would continue into 2006. On January 27, Six Flags announced the sale of Frontier City and White Water Bay after the 2006 operating season. At the same time, Six Flags announced it would close corporate offices in Oklahoma City, moving its headquarters to New York City. Six Flags CEO Mark Shapiro said he expected the parks to continue operation after the sale, a lesson the company learned after its public relations debacle with the closure of AstroWorld. In June, Six Flags announced it was considering closing or selling up to six of its parks, including Elitch Gardens, Darien Lake, WaterWorld in (Concord, California), Wild Waves and Enchanted Village in Federal Way, Washington, Splashtown in Houston, Texas and, most notably, Six Flags Magic Mountain. In addition, Six Flags announced the sale of Wyandot Lake in Powell, Ohio to the neighboring Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. Ultimately, Six Flags Magic Mountain was spared, with the remaining six parks sold on January 11, 2007 to CNL Lifestyle Properties for $312million: $275million cash <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> for $37million.|$|E
