5|$|After {{a four-month}} hiatus, Triple H {{returned}} on the WWE Homecoming episode of Raw on October 3. He {{took part in}} a match, teaming up with Ric Flair, who was wrestling as <b>a</b> <b>face,</b> <b>to</b> take on Chris Masters and Carlito. The duo defeated Masters and Carlito; after the match, Triple H turned on Flair and hit him with a sledgehammer. This led to an angle between Triple H and Flair. At Taboo Tuesday, Triple H and Flair met in a Steel cage match, a stipulation chosen by the fans, for the Intercontinental Championship. The match saw Flair retain the Intercontinental Championship, after escaping through the cage door.|$|E
5|$|After Victory Road, Cage befriended the {{new number}} one {{contender}} Sting on the July 27, 2006 episode of Impact!, by asking for forgiveness for doubting Sting's agenda by coming to TNA in January of that year. He {{went on to}} say that he had asked Jim Cornette the week before if he could be in Sting's corner in his match with Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event, but had told him he needed Sting's approval. Sting accepted Cage's offer, with interviewer and occasional ring announcer Jeremy Borash announcing Sting's decision in a backstage segment on the August 3, 2006 episode of Impact!. On August 13, 2006, Cage was in Sting's corner at Hard Justice as he faced Jarrett, with Scott Steiner in his corner, for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. During the contest, Cage interfered to help Sting win numerous times, as did Steiner for Jarrett, until Cage turned on Sting by taking Jarrett's signature guitar and bashing it over his head—changing his character from <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> a heel. He then allowed Jarrett to pin Sting and retain the title.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the September 11 attacks Rundgren created the score for the film <b>A</b> <b>Face</b> <b>to</b> a Name, directed by Douglas Sloan. The film depicted the many photographs of NY's missing, that were displayed on Bellevue Hospital's 'wall of prayers' following the attacks. The film was part of a special screening at the Woodstock Film Festival in 2002.|$|E
25|$|At {{the height}} of his success, there was talk and {{promotion}} of a fight between him and the former boxing Undisputed Heavyweight Champion Mike Tyson. The two had <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> face confrontation immediately after Sapp's victory in Las Vegas over Kimo. K-1 signed Tyson to a contract and the fight looked to be on. However, Tyson's status as a convicted felon made him unable to get a visa to fight in Japan where the fight would have been most profitable. Other locations for the proposed fight were made, but the fight ultimately never happened.|$|E
25|$|Stephanie Zimbalist, an {{established}} actress with roles in several television movies, was approached {{for the role}} of Laura Holt. At first she turned the series down, not wishing to be tied down to one show, but had a late-night change of heart. Pierce Brosnan (best known then for his role in The Manions of America) auditioned {{for the role of}} Remington Steele, but was initially refused by NBC executives who were concerned that Brosnan was a relative unknown in America. MTM's Stu Erwin stood firm in <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> face meeting with NBC executive Brandon Tartikoff and Tartikoff relented.|$|E

25|$|What {{emerged in}} Western Europe {{was a common}} form of Latin which, though mostly Latin in {{vocabulary}} (with many Germanic words introduced), was heavily influenced by Germanic grammar and represented a radical shift away from the original Roman language. For a few centuries this language remained relatively common across most of Western Europe (hence the fact that Italian, Spanish, French, etc. are far more similar to each other than to Classical Latin), though regional dialects were already developing. As early as 722, in <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> face meeting between Pope Gregory II, {{born and raised in}} Rome, and Saint Boniface, an Anglo-Saxon, Boniface complained that he found Pope Gregory's Latin speech difficult to understand, a clear sign of the transformation of Vulgar Latin in two regions of western Europe.|$|E
25|$|I turned <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> him of such {{joy that}} no-one in that great crowd {{could have had}} one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} several months, Sting feuded with Goldberg, Rick Steiner, Vicious, and Savage. Sting teamed with WCW World Heavyweight Champion Nash at the Bash at the Beach in July to take on Vicious and Savage of Team Madness. Savage pinned Nash and won the World title as a result. Hogan {{returned}} from injury on July 12 as <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Sting defeated Flair on the July 19 edition of Nitro to become the on-screen president of WCW. Later that night, Nash turned heel by attacking Hogan during a title defense against Vicious. Sting remained president for just one week and used his power to book a main event pitting Hogan and himself against Nash and Vicious. Sting vacated the presidency the following week because he only wanted Flair out of the position rather than wanting the power for himself. Along with Goldberg, Sting and Hogan feuded with Nash, Vicious and Rick Steiner for the next month.|$|E

500|$|Waugh {{confirmed}} the autobiographical {{basis for the}} novel on several occasions; at the book's launch on 19 July 1957, to Robert Henriques in a letter of 15 August 1957 ("Mr Pinfold's experiences were almost exactly my own."), and to John Freeman in <b>a</b> <b>Face</b> <b>to</b> Face television interview in 1960. As well as the congruence with real life of specific incidents in the book, Pinfold's age and his domestic and professional circumstances as revealed in the first chapter closely mirror Waugh's. The fictional counterpart shares Waugh's aversions to modern life; he hates [...] "plastic, Picasso, sunbathing and jazz—everything, in fact, that had happened in his own lifetime". [...] Pinfold expresses the same attitude towards his books—"objects that he had made, things quite external to himself"—that Waugh had demonstrated in the second of his 1953 radio interviews.|$|E
500|$|In the {{original}} storyboard, the Lich's lair was not {{specifically designed to}} be a subway. This was added later by the background designers. The undead skeletons that attack Finn and Jake were originally supposed to be [...] "specific undead from [...] ". However, Ward changed his mind and tasked Andy Ristaino, a character designer for the series, with stylizing the corpses. Ristaino designed them to resemble [...] "east coast commuters [...] bundled up for winter." [...] He strove to make them look like people you might see on a subway, such as a bike messenger, a couple, man in a [...] "goofy hat", and a man wearing a suit. Originally, when the Lich set off his bomb, the storyboard featured a simple mushroom cloud. Ian Jones-Quartey, one of the series' storyboard revisionists, however, added <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> the blast. Ristaino then added skulls to the smoke. The series' staff liked this version so much that they later included it on the title card.|$|E
500|$|In mid-September, Nixon's {{running mate}} Spiro Agnew {{went on the}} {{offensive}} against Humphrey; {{he referred to the}} Vice President as being [...] "soft on Communism," [...] along with softness on inflation, and [...] "law and order," [...] comparing him to former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. At this time, Nixon sent his adviser, former Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania, on a fact finding trip to Europe to gather intelligence on Western alliance and Soviet issues. In response to Humphrey's calls for <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> face debate, Nixon remarked: [...] "Before we can have a debate between Nixon and Humphrey, Humphrey's got to settle his debate with himself." [...] Nixon campaigned in San Francisco, in front of 10,000 supporters amidst an array of protests. The candidate took on the protesters first hand, and delivered his [...] "forgotten American" [...] speech, declaring that election day would be [...] "a day of protest for the forgotten American," [...] a group which included those that [...] "obey the law, pay their taxes, go to church, send their children to school, love their country and demand new leadership." [...] By month's end, many in the Nixon campaign believed his election was guaranteed, beginning to prepare for the transition period, despite Nixon's warning that [...] "the one thing that can beat us now is overconfidence." [...] Gallup showed Nixon leading Humphrey 43% to 28% at the end of September.|$|E

2500|$|In her January 31, 2002 {{appearance}} on the sitcom Will & Grace, she played a lesbian mom.

[...] "I don't know why people make such a big deal about the gay thing. ... People are confused, they're shocked like this is a big revelation to somebody." [...] The announcement came two months {{before the end of the}} hosting of her talk show. Although she also cited the need to put <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> gays and lesbians, her primary reason was to bring attention to the gay adoption issue. O'Donnell is a foster and adoptive mother. She protested against adoption agencies, particularly in Florida, that refused adoptive rights to gay and lesbian parents.|$|E
