5|$|Much {{is written}} about the {{different}} factors that threaten the painted turtle, but they are unquantified, with only inferences of relative importance. A primary threat category is habitat loss in various forms. Related to water habitat, there is drying of wetlands, clearing of aquatic logs or rocks (basking sites), <b>and</b> <b>clearing</b> of shoreline vegetation, which allows more predator access or increased human foot traffic. Related to nesting habitat, urbanization or planting can remove needed sunny soils.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the regiment's time, when not on expeditions, was spent in fatigue duty building fortifications around Suffolk.

This was exacerbated by antagonistic feelings between the civilians of occupied Suffolk and the enlisted men of the 6th Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|An {{entry level}} diver must learn the {{techniques}} of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering it if dislodged from the mouth, <b>and</b> <b>clearing</b> the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is at {{a high risk of}} drowning. A related skill is sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as the donor and the recipient. This is usually done with a secondary demand valve carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also learn how to use a backup gas supply carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency gas supply or bailout cylinder.|$|E

5|$|On 15 December, {{this plan}} was {{worked out with}} the help of the Luftwaffe′s Jagd-Geschwaderkommodore, among them Gotthard Handrick (Jagdabschnittsführer Mittelrhein; Fighter Sector Leader Middle Rhein), Walter Grabmann and Karl Hentschel, commanders of 3. and 5. Jagddivision respectively. It was {{originally}} scheduled to support the Battle of the Bulge, the German Army′s offensive, which began 16 December 1944. However, the same bad weather that prevented the RAF and USAAF from supporting their own ground forces also prevented the Luftwaffe from carrying out the operation. It was therefore not launched until 1 January 1945. By this time, the German Army had lost momentum owing to Allied resistance <b>and</b> <b>clearing</b> weather, which allowed Allied Air Forces to operate. The German Army attempted to restart the attack by launching Operation Northwind (Unternehmen Nordwind). The Luftwaffe was to support this offensive through Bodenplatte.|$|E
5|$|The Western Australia State Emergency Service (SES) was {{responsible}} for responses relating to the damage from Rosita. SES workers worked to help the community recover, tarping damaged roofs <b>and</b> <b>clearing</b> debris from roads and around houses where it limited access from residents. Most work involved clearing vegetation from power lines to enable Western Power to begin repairs. Volunteers from other Western Australian cities and towns such as Perth, Bunbury, Karratha, Derby and Tom Price had arrived to assist with requests for help. During the recovery period, the SES earned huge public respect, and residents were pleased with the quick response of the SES.|$|E
5|$|The walrus has {{a diverse}} and {{opportunistic}} diet, feeding {{on more than}} 60 genera of marine organisms, including shrimp, crabs, tube worms, soft corals, tunicates, sea cucumbers, various mollusks, and even parts of other pinnipeds. However, it prefers benthic bivalve mollusks, especially clams, for which it forages by grazing along the sea bottom, searching and identifying prey with its sensitive vibrissae <b>and</b> <b>clearing</b> the murky bottoms with jets of water and active flipper movements. The walrus sucks the meat out by sealing its powerful lips to the organism and withdrawing its piston-like tongue rapidly into its mouth, creating a vacuum. The walrus palate is uniquely vaulted, enabling effective suction.|$|E
