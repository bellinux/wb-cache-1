25|$|Claims from {{scientific}} research on {{sex differences in}} intelligence, quite independently of their scientific validity, can have self-fulfilling effects and therefore sustain the very sex differences they seek to explain. Psychologist Barry Schwartz extended the concept of idea technology to convey {{the point that the}} ideas and concepts produced by science and technology, just like the tangible products, can <b>affect</b> <b>our</b> lives. This notion is also described as looping effects or feedback effects in cognition and culture, whereby the causal understanding of a particular social group changes the very character of the group, leading to further change in the phenomenon under investigation.|$|E
25|$|First Jackson {{argued that}} qualia are epiphenomenal: not causally efficacious {{with respect to}} the {{physical}} world. Jackson does not give a positive justification for this claim—rather, he seems to assert it simply because it defends qualia against the classic problem of dualism. Our natural assumption would be that qualia must be causally efficacious in the physical world, but some would ask how we could argue for their existence if they did not <b>affect</b> <b>our</b> brains. If qualia are to be non-physical properties (which they must be in order to constitute an argument against physicalism), some argue that {{it is almost impossible to}} imagine how they could have a causal effect on the physical world. By redefining qualia as epiphenomenal, Jackson attempts to protect them from the demand of playing a causal role.|$|E

500|$|While {{reviewing}} 52nd Street Stephen Thomas Erlewine of {{the website}} AllMusic noted that [...] "Honesty" [...] {{was one of}} Joel's best songs. Timothy White of Billboard magazine called the song a pensive pop hit. A writer of Rolling Stone felt that [...] "The sweet music of 'Honesty' is sabotaged by trite lyrics". The Phoenixs Michael Lawson noted that the song was [...] "well suited for middle-of-the-road tastes". According to Ken Bielen, [...] "'Honesty' is a plea for truth, not only in romantic relationships {{but also from the}} politicians who <b>affect</b> <b>our</b> lives." [...] Adam Graham of MTV News described the song as a [...] "big ballad". The song was nominated in the category for Song of the Year at the 22nd Grammy Awards held on February 27, 1980.|$|E
500|$|In November 1997, {{the band}} found itself {{the target of}} congressional hearings, led by Senator Joseph Lieberman and Representative Sam Brownback, to {{determine}} the effects, if any, of violent lyrics on young listeners.

[...] Lieberman {{would go on to}} refer to the band as [...] "perhaps the sickest group ever promoted by a mainstream record company."

[...] Joss Whedon did state that the show would be autonomous from The Avengers, saying [...] "It's gotta be a show that works for people who haven't seen the Marvel movies. It will please Marvel fans, I think." [...] He reiterated that sentiment in an interview at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, explaining [...] "It's new characters. It needs to be its own thing. It needs to be adjacent ... What does S.H.I.E.L.D. have that the other superheroes don't? And that, to me, is that they're not superheroes, but they live in that universe. Even though they're a big organization, that [...] makes them underdogs, and that's interesting to me." ...|$|E

500|$|According to the Hindustan Times, Kaminey [...] "is {{the first}} attempt to deal with reality in a mature, matter of fact manner." [...] Unlike other Hindi films, in which the female lead is Sita, the protagonist is Rama and the {{antagonist}} is Ravana, the characters in Kaminey are nuanced humans in [...] "layered and complex" [...] situations. Namrata Joshi from Outlook wrote that Kaminey reflects Bhardwaj's [...] "enduring fascination for underdogs, characters {{on the margins of}} society and the morally compromised". Bhardwaj told Rediff.com that the film deals with [...] "themes that <b>affect</b> <b>our</b> lives directly", and [...] "is a reminder that we all have a dark side, and often we are not fully aware of that side". Rakesh Bedi from The Economic Times wrote, [...] "Bhardwaj presents the two warring brothers with speech defects. In today's world of logorrhea, communication is fraught with many dangers: misunderstandings, paranoias, recriminations, conflicts. Everyone speaks but no one understands. Bhardwaj gave the twins verbal impediments to show that the world has now been so hardwired to convoluted and calamitous communication that it needs silence or a speech defect to hash things out." [...] He continued, [...] "ith some glitches, Bhardwaj has almost re-birthed the Hindi film". The film also explores sex and sexuality, which according to Bedi were explored in a [...] "radically different and refreshing" [...] way, and the director [...] "daringly takes it a step further". When Sweety becomes pregnant, the couple [...] "decide to carry the pregnancy to term after a bit of hesitation. So she literally pushes her man into marriage. (Had Bhardwaj abjured marriage, {{it would have been a}} complete break but the nuptials were essential to the drama of the film.)" [...] The Daily Beast said that [...] "for aficionados of the Hindi-language genre, Kaminey is a revolutionary manifesto. It takes classic Bollywood tropes—estranged brothers, a case of mistaken identity, high drama approaching slapstick comedy—and presents them with Hollywood-style realism instead of Bollywood's wink-nudge mix of melodrama and posturing.|$|E
