5|$|All {{of these}} units {{including}} the 4–319th FAR are <b>airborne</b> qualified, making the 173rd <b>Airborne</b> Brigade Combat Team the only separate <b>airborne</b> brigade in the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|Between August 1943 and February 1945, the 13th <b>Airborne</b> Division {{remained}} in the United States and did not serve overseas or participate in any <b>airborne</b> operations, as it began training to become a combat-ready formation. In comparison, the 82nd and 101st <b>Airborne</b> Divisions had been assigned as active combat formations to serve overseas in Europe, the 11th <b>Airborne</b> Division {{was scheduled to be}} deployed to the Pacific Theater of Operations, and the 17th <b>Airborne</b> Division had been assigned as the United States strategic reserve formation. During this period, the activities of the division primarily involved <b>airborne</b> training, as well as taking part in several training exercises. However, while <b>airborne</b> training for the first four American <b>airborne</b> divisions was conducted during 1943, the 13th encountered considerable difficulties when it came to its turn for training. By the last few months of 1943 the 82nd and 101st <b>Airborne</b> Divisions had conducted <b>airborne</b> exercises and finished their training, and had then been transferred to Europe; to ensure the divisions could conduct <b>airborne</b> operations, a majority of the transport aircraft available in the United States had been sent with them, and even more were transferred to Europe as replacements after the American <b>airborne</b> landings in Normandy in June 1944. Consequently, very few transport aircraft were available for use by the 13th, and the original training exercise for the division that had been scheduled for June 1944 had to be postponed until 17 September, and then once again until 24 September.|$|E
5|$|In February 1948 the 2nd Parachute Brigade {{left the}} 6th <b>Airborne</b> Division {{and moved to}} Germany, {{becoming}} part of the British Army of the Rhine. The 6th <b>Airborne</b> Division was disbanded soon afterwards, leaving the 2nd Parachute Brigade as the only brigade-sized <b>airborne</b> formation in the British Army.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the seaborne landings, there were also <b>airborne</b> landings during the invasion. The U.S. 82nd <b>Airborne</b> Division, under Major General Matthew Ridgway, would land {{in support of the}} Seventh Army, while the British 1st <b>Airborne</b> Division, under Major General George Hopkinson, conducted brigade-sized landings along the eastern coast to support the Eighth Army.|$|E
5|$|On {{formation}} {{the brigade}} {{was assigned to}} the 1st <b>Airborne</b> Division, and as such had to supply reinforcements to make the 1st Parachute Brigade up to strength before they left to take part in Operation Torch. When the 1st <b>Airborne</b> Division left England for operations in the Mediterranean, the 3rd Parachute Brigade remained behind, and was assigned as the first unit of the newly raised 6th <b>Airborne</b> Division. The brigade would remain part of the 6th <b>Airborne</b> Division until 1947, when it was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Once in Britain the {{division}} {{was attached to}} U.S. XVIII <b>Airborne</b> Corps, under Major General Matthew Ridgway, which commanded all American <b>airborne</b> formations, and which in turn {{became part of the}} First Allied <b>Airborne</b> Army when it was formed on 21 August, under the command of Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brereton. Although attached to XVIII <b>Airborne</b> Corps, {{the division}} was not chosen to participate in Operation Market Garden, a large-scale <b>airborne</b> operation intended to seize several bridges through the Netherlands to allow the Allied armies to bypass the Rhine river and enter Germany. The 17th was passed over in favour of the 82nd and 101st <b>Airborne</b> Divisions because it had only recently arrived in the European Theater and was considered to be unprepared logistically as it was still collecting its combat equipment. The division, now with Colonel Edson Raff's 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment under commanda veteran unit which had fought in Normandy under command of the 82nd <b>Airborne</b> Divisionremained in England as a theater reserve during Market Garden and its aftermath, as the Allied armies continued their advance towards Germany.|$|E
5|$|Several modern {{historians have}} also praised the {{operation}} and the improvements that were made for Varsity. G. G. Norton argued that the operation benefited from the lessons learned from previous operations, and Brian Jewell agrees, arguing that the lessons of Market Garden had been learned as the <b>airborne</b> forces were concentrated and quickly dropped, giving the defenders little time to recover. Norton also argues that improvements were made for supporting the <b>airborne</b> troops; he notes {{that a large number}} of artillery pieces were available to cover the landings and that observers were dropped with the <b>airborne</b> forces, thus augmenting the firepower and flexibility of the <b>airborne</b> troops. He also highlights the development of a technique that allowed entire brigades to be landed in tactical groups, giving them greater flexibility. Dropping the <b>airborne</b> forces after the ground forces had breached the Rhine also ensured that the <b>airborne</b> troops would not have to fight for long before being relieved, a major improvement on the manner in which the previous large-scale <b>airborne</b> operation, Market Garden, had been conducted.|$|E
5|$|The 13th <b>Airborne</b> Division was {{the fifth}} <b>airborne</b> {{division}} to be formed in the United States during World War II, and was officially activated on Friday the 13th of August 1943 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, {{under the command of}} Major General George W. Griner, Jr. Only {{a few months after the}} activation of the division, however, Major General Griner was ordered to take command of the 98th Infantry Division, and was replaced by Major General Elbridge Chapman, who would go on to command the division for the rest of the conflict. Chapman was one of the early pioneers of the American <b>airborne</b> concept, commanding the experimental 88th <b>Airborne</b> Infantry Battalion in late 1941 when he was a lieutenant colonel, before going on to take command of the 13th <b>Airborne</b> Division. The 88th <b>Airborne</b> Infantry Battalion would be renamed as the 88th <b>Airborne</b> Infantry Regiment, and then finally become the 88th Glider Infantry Regiment on 21 September 1942, forming the core of the 13th <b>Airborne</b> Division. When it was activated, the 13th <b>Airborne</b> Division was initially composed of the 515th Parachute Infantry Regiment, the 88th Glider Infantry Regiment and the 326th Glider Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|The 173rd <b>Airborne</b> Brigade Combat Team ("Sky Soldiers") is an <b>airborne</b> {{infantry}} brigade combat {{team of the}} United States Army {{based in}} Vicenza, Italy. It is the United States European Command's conventional <b>airborne</b> strategic response force for Europe.|$|E
5|$|The 17th <b>Airborne</b> Division was an <b>airborne</b> {{infantry}} {{division of the}} United States Army during World War II, commanded by Major General William M. Miley.|$|E
5|$|The 1st <b>Airborne</b> Division was an <b>airborne</b> {{infantry}} {{division of the}} British Army during the Second World War. The division was formed in late 1941 during World War II, after the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, demanded an <b>airborne</b> force, and was initially under command of Major-General Frederick A. M. Browning. The division {{was one of two}} <b>airborne</b> divisions raised by the British Army during the war, with the other being the 6th <b>Airborne</b> Division, created in May 1943, using former units of the 1st <b>Airborne</b> Division.|$|E
5|$|The 20th Engineer Brigade is {{a combat}} {{engineer}} brigade {{assigned to the}} XVIII <b>Airborne</b> Corps of the United States Army stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Although the brigade was identified as an <b>airborne</b> unit, not all of its subordinate units were <b>airborne</b> qualified—despite the <b>airborne</b> tab {{as part of the}} unit patch. Soldiers of the 20th Engineer Brigade provide various supportive duties to other Army units, including construction, engineering, and mechanical work on other Army projects.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Parachute Brigade was an <b>airborne</b> forces brigade {{raised by}} the British Army during the Second World War. The brigade was {{initially}} part of the 1st <b>Airborne</b> Division, but remained in Britain when that division was sent overseas, and {{became part of the}} 6th <b>Airborne</b> Division, alongside 5th Parachute Brigade and 6th Airlanding Brigade.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Airlanding Brigade {{had always}} been an {{integral}} part of the 6th <b>Airborne</b> Division, but when the 1st <b>Airborne</b> Division was disbanded, and its 1st Parachute Brigade was assigned to the 6th <b>Airborne</b> Division, the 6th Airlanding Brigade became surplus to the division's requirements. On 15April1946, the brigade ceased being part of the British Army's <b>airborne</b> forces, and was renumbered the 31st Independent Infantry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|The German {{military}} had pioneered using <b>airborne</b> formations, conducting several successful <b>airborne</b> operations during the Battle of France in 1940, including the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael. Impressed {{by the success}} of German <b>airborne</b> operations, the Allied governments decided to form their own <b>airborne</b> formations. This decision would eventually lead to the creation of two British <b>airborne</b> divisions, {{as well as a number}} of smaller units. The British <b>airborne</b> establishment began development on 22 June 1940, when the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office in a memorandum to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops. When the equipment to be used by the <b>airborne</b> forces was under development, War Office officials decided that gliders would be an integral component, to transport troops and heavy equipment.|$|E
5|$|The M22 Locust, officially Light Tank (<b>Airborne),</b> M22, was an American-designed <b>airborne</b> light tank {{which was}} {{produced}} during World War II. The Locust began development in 1941 after the British War Office {{requested that the}} American government design a purpose-built <b>airborne</b> light tank which could be transported by glider into battle to support British <b>airborne</b> forces. The War Office had originally selected the Light Tank Mark VII Tetrarch light tank {{for use by the}} <b>airborne</b> forces, but it had not been designed with that exact purpose in mind so the War Office believed that a purpose-built tank would be required to replace it. The United States Ordnance Department was asked to produce this replacement, which in turn selected Marmon-Herrington to design and build a prototype <b>airborne</b> tank in May 1941. The prototype was designated the Light Tank T9 (<b>Airborne),</b> and was designed so that it could be transported underneath a Douglas C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft, although its dimensions also allowed it to fit inside a General Aircraft Hamilcar glider.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} Allied <b>airborne</b> {{divisions}} were three American units. However, the 11th <b>Airborne</b> Division was {{fighting in the}} Pacific War, while the 13th and 17th <b>Airborne</b> Divisions {{were back in the}} United States training.|$|E
5|$|The {{troops for}} the Ranger company {{were to be}} <b>Airborne</b> qualified, so the Ranger Training Center heavily {{recruited}} troops from the 82nd <b>Airborne</b> Division and 11th <b>Airborne</b> Division who had already completed United States Army <b>Airborne</b> School. In spite of this, only one Ranger operation in the conflict ever required an <b>airborne</b> landing. At the first <b>Airborne</b> Ranger graduation in November 1950, each Ranger was given a black and gold Ranger Tab as a shoulder sleeve insignia. A few days later, each Ranger was issued a blue and white tab and instructed to sew it above the Ranger Tab. The <b>Airborne</b> Ranger Companies then in Korea were deactivated on August 1, 1951. They were merged into the 187th <b>Airborne</b> Regimental Combat Team {{to bring them back}} up to strength with airborne-qualified combat-experienced replacements. The 187th had been moved to Kyushu, Japan’s southern island to take on a (then Top Secret) mission to save the UN negotiators at Kaesong, North Korea.|$|E

5|$|To {{ensure that}} the {{operation}} was a success, Montgomery insisted that an <b>airborne</b> component be inserted into {{the plans for the}} operation, to support the amphibious assaults that would take place; this was code-named Operation Varsity. Three <b>airborne</b> divisions were initially chosen to participate in the operation, these being the British 6th <b>Airborne</b> Division, the U.S. 13th <b>Airborne</b> Division and the U.S. 17th <b>Airborne</b> Division, all of which were assigned to U.S. XVIII <b>Airborne</b> Corps, commanded by Major General Matthew B. Ridgway. One of these <b>airborne</b> formations, the British 6th <b>Airborne</b> Division, commanded by Major-General Eric Bols, was a veteran division; it had taken part in Operation Overlord, the assault on Normandy in June the previous year. However, the U.S. 17th <b>Airborne</b> Division, under Major General William Miley, had been activated only in April 1943 and had arrived in Britain in August 1944, too late to participate in Operation Overlord. The division did not participate in Operation Market Garden. It did, however, participate in the Ardennes campaign but had yet {{to take part in a}} combat drop. The U.S. 13th <b>Airborne</b> Division, under Major General Eldridge Chapman, had been activated in August 1943 and was transferred to France in 1945; the formation itself had never seen action, although one of its regiments, the 517th Parachute Infantry, had fought briefly in Italy, and later in Southern France and the Ardennes campaign.|$|E
5|$|Whereas {{all other}} Allied <b>airborne</b> {{landings}} {{had been a}} surprise for the Germans, the Rhine crossing was expected and their defences were reinforced in anticipation. The <b>airborne</b> operation was preceded by a two-day round-the-clock bombing mission by the Allied air forces. Then on 23March 3,500 artillery guns targeted the German positions. At dusk Operation Plunder, an assault river crossing of the Rhine by the 21st Army Group, began. For their part in Operation Varsity, the 6th <b>Airborne</b> Division {{was assigned to the}} American XVIII <b>Airborne</b> Corps alongside the US 17th <b>Airborne</b> Division.|$|E

5|$|After {{participating}} in the Battle of the Bulge, the division was moved behind the front-lines as a reserve formation and theater reserve, whilst the Allies continued their advance towards the German interior. However, even as the division received replacements and trained, {{it had already been}} selected {{to take part in a}} highly ambitious <b>airborne</b> operation code-named Operation Eclipse. This operation, which got to such an advanced stage that plans had been created and divisional commanders briefed, called for the 17th and 82nd <b>Airborne</b> divisions, along with a brigade from the British 6th <b>Airborne</b> Division, to be dropped in daylight in and around Berlin to capture the city. The operation received the support of General Henry H. Arnold, the Chief of the United States Army Air Corps, but planning ended on 28 March, when General Eisenhower sent a message to Joseph Stalin indicating that the Allied armies would not attempt to capture Berlin, thereby making Eclipse obsolete. Eclipse and several other similarly ambitious <b>airborne</b> operations came to nothing, but in February the division finally received word that it would be involved in an Allied <b>airborne</b> operation to cross the River Rhine in support of the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group that would take place during March.|$|E
5|$|After {{the capture}} of Bréville, the Germans never seriously {{attempted}} {{to break through the}} <b>airborne</b> division's lines again. The British division only being subjected to sporadic artillery and mortar fire. This lasted until 17August, when the Germans started to withdraw and the 6th <b>Airborne</b> Division advanced to the River Seine.|$|E
5|$|AirSpace also houses <b>Airborne</b> Assault, {{the museum}} of the British Army's Parachute Regiment and <b>airborne</b> forces. Previously located at Browning Barracks near Aldershot, the museum opened at Duxford on 8 December 2008. The opening {{ceremony}} was led by Prince Charles, the Parachute Regiment's Colonel-in-Chief. The museum chronicles the history of British <b>airborne</b> forces from the Second World War to current operations in Afghanistan and cost £3 million.|$|E

5|$|<b>Airborne</b> radar for {{detecting}} ships at sea {{came to be}} known as Air-to-Surface-Vessel (ASV) radar. Its successes led to continued demands for additional tests. Growing interest and increased efforts in ASV contributed to delays in <b>airborne</b> intercept sets; the team spent a considerable time in 1937 and 1938 working on the ASV problem.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decision}} to disband the Ranger units, the 2nd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 while it was still in Korea. Like many of the other Ranger units, most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an <b>airborne</b> unit, it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th, their <b>airborne</b> skills could be used. Nevertheless, in the end it turned out that Operation Tomahawk was the last <b>airborne</b> jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers did not get a chance to exercise these skills again.|$|E
5|$|As the {{organization}} of the Army changed following Vietnam, the 20th Engineer Brigade was again reactivated at Fort Bragg, North Carolina as an <b>airborne</b> brigade on 21 June 1974. Assigned as a subordinate command of the XVIII <b>Airborne</b> Corps, which comprised one <b>airborne</b> combat engineer battalion, a heavy construction battalion and four separate companies. Additionally, the 283rd Engineer Detachment (Terrain Analysis) provided terrain intelligence needs of the brigade's mission. Since that time the brigade and its subordinate units supported the XVIII <b>Airborne</b> Corps, fulfilling critical combat engineer, construction, topographic, and bridging missions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} May 1945, the {{division}} was pulled out of Germany and returned to England. It was initially intended {{to send them to}} India to form an <b>airborne</b> corps with the 44th Indian <b>Airborne</b> Division. The division’s advance party, formed around the 5th Parachute Brigade, had already arrived in India. Following the Japanese surrender, all these plans changed. The post-war British Army only needed one <b>airborne</b> division, and the 6th <b>Airborne</b> was chosen to remain on strength. Reinforced by the 2nd Parachute Brigade, {{the division}} was sent to the Middle East as the Imperial Strategic Reserve.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war in Europe, it {{had been}} planned to send the {{division}} to Burma to form an <b>airborne</b> corps with the 44th Indian <b>Airborne</b> Division. However, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Japanese surrender, ended the war and changed British plans. The 6th <b>Airborne</b> Division was nominated to be the Imperial Strategic Reserve. Together with a Royal Air Force troop-carrier formation, they were to be located in the Middle East as a quick reaction peace keeping force for the British Empire. Initially No. 283 Wing RAF had two squadrons of transport aircraft, 620 and 644, available to provide troop transport.|$|E
5|$|Background: The {{distinctive}} unit insignia {{was originally}} approved for the 173d <b>Airborne</b> Brigade on 10 August 1967. The insignia was redesignated for the 173d <b>Airborne</b> Brigade Combat Team with the description updated on 11 October 2006.|$|E
5|$|Browning {{supervised}} {{the newly formed}} division as it underwent a prolonged period of expansion and intensive training, with new brigades raised and assigned to the division, and new equipment tested. Though not considered an <b>airborne</b> warfare visionary, he proved adept at dealing with an apathetic War Office and an obstructionist Air Ministry, and demonstrated a knack for overcoming bureaucratic obstacles. As the <b>airborne</b> forces expanded in size, the major difficulty in getting the 1st <b>Airborne</b> Division ready for operations was a shortage of aircraft. The Royal Air Force had neglected air transport before the war, and the only available aircraft for <b>airborne</b> troops were conversions of obsolete bombers like the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris in particular felt that the 1st <b>Airborne</b> Division was not worth the drain on Bomber Command's resources.|$|E
5|$|Browning's {{dealings}} with the British Army were no smoother. His successor as commander of the 1st <b>Airborne</b> Division, Major-General Hopkinson, had sold the British Eighth Army commander, General Sir Bernard Montgomery, on Operation Ladbroke, a glider landing to seize the Ponte Grande road bridge south of Syracuse. Browning's objections to the operation were ignored, and attempts to discuss <b>airborne</b> operations with the corps commanders elicited a directive from Montgomery that all such discussion {{had to go through}} him. Browning concluded that to be effective, the <b>airborne</b> advisor had to have equal rank with the army commanders.|$|E
