5|$|In {{the early}} days of his administration, Leggett took the lead on a number of {{controversial}} issues. To help alleviate transportation funding difficulties and move County transit projects forward, he proposed a statewide gas tax increase, a position he first articulated in his race for County Executive. This proposal, which happened {{in the midst of a}} state budget crunch <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> high levels of traffic congestion in the county, was supported by the County Council but largely ignored by incoming Governor Martin O'Malley. Leggett continued to advocate for the increase throughout his term.|$|E
50|$|Ion {{channels}} can {{be classified}} by how they respond to their environment. For example, the ion channels involved in the action potential are voltage-sensitive channels; they open <b>and</b> close <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the voltage across the membrane. Ligand-gated channels form another important class; these ion channels open <b>and</b> close <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the binding of a ligand molecule, such as a neurotransmitter. Other ion channels open and close with mechanical forces. Still other ion channels—such as those of sensory neurons—open <b>and</b> close <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> other stimuli, such as light, temperature or pressure.|$|R

5|$|On 2 June, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> a {{question}} from Fianna Fáil's James Browne about government spending on mental health, McEntee told the Dáil the government was committed to an annual increase in funding; Browne had noted that in 2014, €20 million had been allocated to mental health services rather than the promised €35 million, but McEntee said that €35 million had been ringfenced for 2016 and 2017. Along with Minister for Health Simon Harris, McEntee argued {{for the restoration of}} €12 million originally ringfenced for mental health spending that had been diverted to other areas. On 8 June, and as part of a €480m bailout package for health, the government announced that the mental health funding would be restored. Welcoming the decision, McEntee said the money would be used for staff recruitment and to improve services for homeless people, as well as developing perinatal mental health services.|$|E

Native son Pickett journeyed from Oregon to serve his state. Arriving after the First Battle of Bull Run, he resigned his commission in the U.S. Army on June 25, 1861; he had been holding a commission as a major in the Confederate States Army Artillery since March 16. Within a month he was appointed colonel {{in command of the}} Rappahannock Line of the Department of Fredericksburg, under the command of Major General Theophilus H. Holmes. Holmes's influence obtained a commission for Pickett as a brigadier general, dated January 14, 1862.|$|E

5|$|To {{increase}} the toll on Allied bombers further, intruder operations restarted briefly in August 1943 and took place intermittently {{or on the}} initiative of single crews, since no organised Fernnachtjagd existed after October 1941. Success was still possible. On 22 April 1944 the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) 1st Bombardment Division and 3rd Bombardment Division were returning to England in darkening skies after a daylight raid over Germany. They were attacked by an element of Messerschmitt Me 410 bomber destroyers of Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51—Bomber Wing 51) over their bases. Over the next twenty minutes, 10 aircraft, nine of them B-24 Liberators, were shot down and 61 men killed {{for the loss of}} only two Me 410s and four airmen. The attack coincided with Operation Steinbock, a bombing and intruder offensive against Greater London <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the British offensive against German industrial cities, but the operation was aimed at the British capital rather than British bomber bases.|$|E
