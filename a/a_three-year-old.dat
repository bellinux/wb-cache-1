5000|$|One of Bouncer's {{most famous}} storylines had him dreaming {{that he was}} getting married to Rosie, Clarrie McLachlan's (Frederick Parslow) Border Collie, who lived next door. During an interview, Anne Charleston (who played Madge Bishop) said [...] "The whole cast was mortified about that! It reduced it to <b>a</b> <b>three-year-old's</b> programme. It was very strange." ...|$|R
50|$|When {{exposed to}} <b>a</b> threat, <b>three-year-old</b> {{children}} were observed to exhibit a similar tendency to overestimate elapsed time.|$|R
5|$|Before Ladas ran as <b>a</b> <b>three-year-old,</b> Mat Dawson, who {{had been}} {{training}} horses, including more than twenty classic winners since the 1850s, {{was reported to have}} called Ladas the best he had ever trained. Later that season he ranked him second, slightly behind St. Simon. Henry Chaplin, the owner of Hermit, called Ladas the finest horse he had seen.|$|E
5|$|Joe Daniels (1869–1896) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse and {{stallion}} who won {{the sixth}} Belmont Stakes in 1872.

5|$|Sherwood also adopted {{neglected}} or orphaned {{children from}} the camp. In 1807 she adopted Annie Child, <b>a</b> <b>three-year-old</b> who had been given too much medicinal gin and in 1808 a malnourished two-year-old Sally Pownal. She found homes for those she could not adopt and founded an orphanage. In 1816, {{on the advice of}} doctors, she and her family returned to Britain; in her autobiography Sherwood relates that she was continually ill in India and it was believed at the time that neither she nor any of her children could survive in a tropical climate.|$|E
5|$|While still <b>a</b> <b>three-year-old,</b> he was {{exported}} to England {{where he was}} registered in the General Stud Book. He was imported by Richard Croker, {{at a cost of}} about 8000 guineas. Americus' importation to England occurred before the imposition of the Jersey Act, which allowed him and his offspring to be registered in the General Stud Book, something that would not have happened had he been imported into England after 1913, due to the Jersey Act's prohibition on registering horses tracing to Lexington in the General Stud Book.|$|E
5|$|Young Wizard (1814) – {{owned by}} the 3rd Baron Foley and later the 2nd Marquess of Exeter. As <b>a</b> <b>three-year-old</b> in 1817 he won the Riddlesworth Stakes at Newmarket and a Produce Sweepstakes at Doncaster.

50|$|Sea The Stars {{completed}} <b>a</b> perfect <b>three-year-old</b> campaign, winning six Group I {{races in}} six months, including two English Classic races and one French Classic race. His three-year-old record {{is described by}} many as the best of modern thoroughbred racing.|$|R
5|$|Blacklock (1814 – 24 February 1831) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse who won {{seventeen}} of his twenty-three races. As {{a two-year-old}} in 1816 he was undefeated in three starts. In his first race as <b>a</b> <b>three-year-old</b> he {{finished second in}} the St. Leger, a neck behind Ebor. He then won four races in two weeks, including the Gascoigne Stakes and Dundas Stakes. In 1818 he recorded several wins including two of the Great Subscription Purses at York. He won a third Great Subscription Purse in 1819, along with the York Gold Cup. After retiring from racing, Blacklock became a successful stallion and was champion sire of Great Britain in 1829, the year his son Voltaire won the Doncaster Cup. He was owned by Thomas Kirby as a two-year-old, before being purchased by Richard Watt, who owned him for the remainder of his racing career. Blacklock was trained by Tommy Sykes.|$|E
5|$|Coyote {{attacks on}} humans are {{uncommon}} and rarely cause serious injuries, {{due to the}} relatively small size of the coyote, but have been increasingly frequent, especially in California. There have been two confirmed fatal attacks: one on <b>a</b> <b>three-year-old</b> named Kelly Keen in Glendale, California and another on a nineteen-year-old named Taylor Mitchell in Nova Scotia, Canada. In the 30 {{years leading up to}} March 2006, at least 160 attacks occurred in the United States, mostly in the Los Angeles County area. Data from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife Services, the California Department of Fish and Game, and other sources show that while 41 attacks occurred during the period of 1988–1997, 48 attacks were verified from 1998 through 2003. The majority of these incidents occurred in Southern California near the suburban-wildland interface.|$|E
5|$|In autumn Lord Hastings, {{the owner}} of the 1885 Derby winner Melton issued a {{challenge}} to Jack Hammond for a £1,000 match race between his horse and St. Gatien, with Melton to receive nine pounds. The challenge was declined, as St. Gatien had already been heavily backed for the Cambridgeshire Handicap, a race in which he had been assigned 136 pounds and Hammond did not want to disrupt the horse's preparation. St. Gatien returned to the racecourse after a break of four months in Her Majesty's Plate over two miles at Newmarket on October 12. The race proved meaningless as a contest, his only opponent being <b>a</b> <b>three-year-old</b> filly called Jane who had finished runner-up in the 1000 Guineas. St. Gatien started at odds of 1/33 and won with predictable ease by twenty lengths.|$|E
50|$|Earlier in 2013, Tonda, <b>a</b> 4.3-metre, <b>three-year-old</b> adult male, {{was moved}} from Paignton Zoo to Chessington Zoo, both in England.

50|$|He {{was first}} sent to race in France. There, racing on grass, Criminal Type was a winner at age two, but after <b>a</b> poor <b>three-year-old</b> season {{he was brought}} back to the United States and turned over to trainer D. Wayne Lukas.|$|R
50|$|Leica Guv (foaled 22 August 1998) is a {{thoroughbred}} racehorse who in <b>a</b> brilliant <b>three-year-old</b> season won the New Zealand Derby in 2001. Unfortunately he {{was never}} able to match the ability he showed in 2001 in the remainder of his career.|$|R
5|$|Orme (1889 – 17 September 1915) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. He {{was trained}} at Kingsclere by John Porter for the 1st Duke of Westminster. As a two-year-old {{he won the}} Middle Park and Dewhurst Stakes. As <b>a</b> <b>three-year-old</b> he was not well enough {{to take part in}} the 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby, but came back to win the Eclipse Stakes. Orme stayed in {{training}} as a four-year-old and won another Eclipse Stakes, becoming the first horse to win the race twice, a feat that has only been repeated four times since. After he had retired from racing, he became a successful sire and was Champion sire of Great Britain in 1899. His son Flying Fox won the Triple Crown and the Eclipse Stakes. Orme also sired Epsom Derby winner Orby and 1000 Guineas winner Witch Elm. His regular jockeys were George Barrett and Morny Cannon.|$|E
5|$|Portrayed by Tom Welling, Clark Kent is {{an alien}} being with superhuman abilities, which {{he uses to}} help others in danger. Clark is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent in the series pilot, when he crash lands to Earth as <b>a</b> <b>three-year-old</b> child. Twelve years later, he tries to find his place in life after being told he is an alien by his adoptive father. For most of the series, Clark spends his time running from his Kryptonian heritage, going as far as leaving Smallville, abandoning a quest his {{biological}} father Jor-El sends him on in search of three Kryptonian stones of knowledge, continuing his training at the Fortress of Solitude, and unwittingly unleashing a Kryptonian criminal from the Phantom Zone when he refuses to kill Lex.|$|E
5|$|The Provincial Assembly of Rio Grande do Sul {{was closed}} in 1837, and no {{elections}} were held {{because of the}} Ragamuffin rebellion. In 1845, Marques de Sousa ran and was elected as provincial deputy in the legislature that met in 1846, though he had no party affiliation. He married Maria Balbina Álvares da Gama, daughter of José Gama Lobo de Eça (later Baron of Saicã), on 28 November 1846. The couple's only child, Maria Manuela da Gama Marques, was born {{less than a year}} and a half later. Marques de Sousa was made brevet brigadier on 14 March 1847, and the 2nd Cavalry Brigade was placed under his command (until April 1848). He was later confirmed in the rank of brigadier on 14 August 1850. On 11 June 1851, his wife died in childbirth (aged 29), leaving him with <b>a</b> <b>three-year-old</b> daughter.|$|E
50|$|Prospectors Delite was <b>a</b> leading <b>three-year-old</b> {{female and}} won {{many of the}} U.S.'s most notable filly stakes, some of which include the G1 Acorn Stakes and the G1 Ashland Stakes. She also {{finished}} third in the Kentucky Oaks and became a successful broodmare.|$|R

5|$|The red-billed tropicbird usually nests on {{isolated}} cliff faces, {{in loose}} colonies. It uses a simple scrape nest, {{located in a}} place it can easily take off from. The age of first breeding is usually five years, although this age is variable; <b>a</b> <b>three-year-old</b> tropicbird was once seen breeding. In some locations, breeding happens year-round, while in others, breeding occurs seasonally. For example, for islands in the California Current, breeding starts in November or December, while it occurs year-round in the Galapagos. Breeding {{is influenced by the}} availability of food, with an increase in food generally causing an increase in breeding. Individually, this bird only breeds every nine to twelve months. A breeding bird usually returns to its partner and nest location from the previous breeding cycle.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{domestic animal}} {{could also be}} regarded as a zduhać, such as a shepherd dog, ox, bellwether, horse, or billy goat. If an animal habitually made vocal sounds in sleep, it was assumed to be a zduhać. Such an animal was cherished, and was not for sale. The spirit of the animal zduhać would leave its body in sleep and fight against the enemy zduhaći, to protect its own flock or herd. Only the fertility of the livestock depended on the outcome of the battles fought by the animal zduhaći; they had no bearing on the crop yield. In the region of Užice, western Serbia, it was believed that storms and hail clouds were led by zduhaći who flew above them in the form of big birds. A black ox and <b>a</b> <b>three-year-old</b> rooster defended their village from them—especially the rooster, for which reason he was not killed for food, but kept as a home guardian. In folk spells for repelling hail clouds in Serbia, these clouds were called white cattle. This could be compared with the idea of the black ox as a defender from hail.|$|E
5|$|Blacklock, still unnamed, had {{his first}} race as <b>a</b> <b>three-year-old</b> in the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster on Monday 22 September. He did not arrive at Doncaster until the Saturday before, and after reports that he was amiss his odds had {{lengthened}} {{to as much as}} 10/1 in the betting. After arriving, he had a gallop in the afternoon and soon shortened in the betting. After another of the pre-race favourites, Stainborough, was withdrawn due to illness Blacklock was sent off as the short-priced favourite at about evens. Blacklock appeared {{like he was going to}} win easily and Jackson eased him up in the final furlong (200 metres) of the race. However, Ebor and Restless began to quickly close down his lead. By the time Jackson realised, Blacklock could not accelerate quick enough and Ebor came out on top, beating Blacklock by a neck. Restless finished in third place and was the only other runner that could be placed by the judge. Blacklock had a crack in one of his hind heels, which was thought to have affected him in the race.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s {{the track}} {{underwent}} a major renovation. The grandstand of the Del Mar Fairgrounds was demolished and replaced. In 1991 the track ran its richest race to date, the $1,000,000 Grade I Pacific Classic Stakes. The first Classic was won by <b>an</b> impressive <b>three-year-old</b> named Best Pal.|$|R
50|$|After <b>an</b> {{outstanding}} <b>three-year-old</b> {{campaign in}} which Honeymoon won seven important California stakes races she was sold for $135,000 in February 1947 {{as part of}} Mayer's dispersal sale. Her new owner was W-L Ranch Co., a racing partnership of two other high profile Hollywood individuals, Harry Warner and Mervyn Le Roy.|$|R
50|$|Omar Khayyam {{was out of}} {{the mare}} Lisma, {{daughter}} of the champion sire Persimmon; his success on the track included wins in the Epsom Derby, St. Leger Stakes and Ascot Gold Cup.
