When I look out at all of the City Year corps members who have been giving so much of themselves for a cause that is so much larger than themselves, I think I have <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question.” ...|$|E
60|$|Under this girl's calm quizzical glance, Courtier endeavoured to find <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question.|$|E
60|$|The bishop's mind went {{hunting for}} <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> indictment. And {{came back and}} came back to the image of Diogenes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There's but <b>ae</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> Henry Bertram,' {{said the}} sibyl. 'I swore my tongue should never tell, but I never said my finger should never show. Go on and meet your fortune, or turn back and lose it: that's a' I hae to say.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I must refer you,' {{returned}} Mr Barnacle, {{ringing the}} bell, 'to the Department itself for <b>a</b> formal <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> inquiry.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you feel}} sure of getting <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> prayer, Flo?" [...] asked McLeod, gazing at his {{daughter}} with a perplexed expression.|$|E
60|$|All Sir Patrick's ingenuity, and all Sir Patrick's experience, {{failed to}} find {{so much as the}} shadow of <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried hard}} to find <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> I even {{embarked}} on an answer without quite knowing where my own words might lead me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is there {{anything}} {{between you and}} Mr Maguire?" [...] said Mrs Stumfold again. [...] "I particularly wish <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> plain <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not possible," [...] {{replied the}} missionary, laughing, [...] "to give <b>a</b> direct <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question, inasmuch as {{the speed of}} the {{locomotive}} varies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is most engrossing," [...] Sabatini murmured. [...] "A signet {{ring with}} a blood-red stone! Wasn't there <b>a</b> ring <b>answering</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> {{description}} upon the finger {{of the man}} who stabbed Rosario?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question," [...] affirmed Mr. Sympson, {{assuming}} vast courage and consequence {{on the strength}} of this symptom of confusion.|$|E
60|$|Apparently {{neither man}} nor dog could return <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question, for they both {{sat for a}} very long time in {{profound}} silence, staring at the sea.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If I might entreat,' said Cousin Feenix, 'that {{you would}} not press for <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question, I would venture to take the liberty of making the request.' ...|$|E
60|$|But Rooney {{never got}} <b>a</b> {{satisfactory}} <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question, and Kajo continued {{to drink and}} smoke until, happily for himself, he had to quit the settlements and proceed to the lands of thick-ribbed ice, where nothing stronger than train oil and lamp-smoke were procurable.|$|R
50|$|This case {{is part of}} a line {{of cases}} {{interpreting}} if and how the Sixth Amendment is applied against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment for the purposes of incorporation doctrine, although the division of opinions prevented <b>a</b> clear-cut <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question in this case.|$|R
30|$|From {{the above}} proposition, we can derive some {{interesting}} results. The first result concerns <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the question <b>that</b> {{has been put}} in the above section.|$|R
6000|$|... "You fancy, then, {{that you}} love that reprobate?" [...] Linda was silent. [...] "Is it so? Tell me. I {{have a right to}} demand <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Schwirtz cheerfully {{took out}} a cigar, smelled it, bit it, luxuriously removed the band, {{requested}} permission to smoke, lighted the cigar without waiting for <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> request, sighed happily, and dived again: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come now;--be honest; is our Mr. Barry a gentleman?" [...] Then {{there was}} a pause, during which she waited for a reply. [...] "I will have an answer.

5000|$|Secret CategoryThis was the show's {{very first}} red category, which first {{appeared}} in the lower right hand corner at the start, then later appeared in the bottom center at the start.

60|$|On the {{following}} morning when Commandant Frank Muller--having heard that his enemy John Niel {{was on his way}} up with the Cape cart and four grey horses--ascertained <b>that</b> <b>a</b> vehicle <b>answering</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> description had been allowed to pass through Heidelberg in the dead of night, his state of mind may better be imagined than described.|$|R
60|$|She shuddered as {{she said}} the words. Something was plainly {{associated}} with her visit to Geoffrey, the bare remembrance of which shook her nerves. What was it? Sir Patrick resolved to obtain <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question, before he ventured on proceeding further with the main object of the interview.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told him}} that he should have the money; and one would have thought that that would have been enough for him. Well: I suppose Augusta likes him. I suppose she wishes the match; otherwise, I would give him such <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> letter as would startle him a little." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question, I {{shall be}} obliged to refer you to the worthy Pete himself. At all events, the only harm he could do us would be to let Newcombe know when we leave here--in case he don't want to wait--and that is just what I fancy Pete himself won't know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm no' saying I canna {{remember}} ye, miss. Whar's the {{man would}} mak' sic <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> as <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bonny young leddy like you?" ...|$|R
60|$|He had no leisure in his {{thoughts}} to ask us whence we came, whither we were going, or who we were; {{but would have}} it always as <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> himself, <b>that</b> <b>to</b> be sure, wherever we were a-going, we came from Heaven, and were sent on purpose to save him from the most wretched condition that ever man was reduced to.|$|R

"Yonder is <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question, which settles it for us," [...] said Glumm quietly, {{pointing}} to a ridge {{on the right of}} the bridle path, which rose high above the tree tops.

60|$|Valencia went out. Certain {{as she was}} of her sister's innocence, {{there was}} one terrible {{question}} in her heart which must be answered, or her belief in all truth, goodness, religion, would reel and rock to its very foundations. And till she had <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> she could not sit still by Lucia.|$|E
6000|$|Deeming myself {{justified}} then in {{what has}} been said,--I will continue to lay open (and, in some degree, to account for) those privations in the materials of judgment, and those delusions of opinion, and infirmities of mind, to which practical Statesmen, and particularly such as are high in office, are more than other men subject;--as containing <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question, so interesting at this juncture,--How far is it in our power to make amends for the harm done? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you a poet?" [...] she demanded. He {{felt that}} her {{question}} had an unexplained weight of meaning behind it, {{as if she}} sought <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> question <b>that</b> she did not ask.|$|R
5000|$|Calculating <b>an</b> exact <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> {{question}} before computers {{was too much}} work. The easy approximation (used in Zeuner's and Realeaux's diagrams) is <b>to</b> pretend <b>that</b> both the valve and the piston have a sine-wave motion (as they would, if the main rod were infinitely long). Then, for instance, to calculate the percent of the piston's stroke at which steam admission is cut off: ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor Polish groups {{acting on}} Polish spaces, E. Effros gave a {{condition}} under which 14 {{properties of the}} orbits or the orbit space of an anti-ergodic character are equivalent.
