2500|$|The Complex was {{available}} for sale on Amazon.com's United Kingdom branch, Amazon.co.uk, as of October 23, 2008. The Sunday Tribune reported in mid-November that Amazon.co.uk, removed The Complex from its website after the Church of Scientology sent a legal letter to the retailer. In the letter, the Church of Scientology claimed that the book contained libelous statements about {{a member of the}} organization. Merlin Publishing has stated that it stands by Duignan and the book. The publishing company [...] "emphatically denied" [...] the allegations made by the Church of Scientology, and Merlin Publishing editorial director Aoife Barrett called Scientology's claim about the book [...] "vexatious". A source at Merlin Publishing told The Sunday Mirror: [...] "It's crazy. These are bully-boy tactics. Their case is weak, {{and we are going to}} fight them." [...] Chenile Keogh, a representative for Merlin Publishing, stated in TribuneNews: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> the book and the author. The book is on sale in Ireland and there is no problem with us publishing in Ireland".|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Fleming reflectively, [...] "there are {{maybe two}} or three. For one thing, I'm {{thinking}} it's a hint {{that the boys}} ashore <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> you. There's a note they sent off in your room." ...|$|E

60|$|Trouble. Accident to naval {{flotilla}} {{en route}} to Piccolo Domingo. The new battleship the Woodrow has broken down. Fault in structure. Tried to go with both ends first. Appeared impossible. Went sideways a little and is sinking. Wireless from the barges the Wilson, the Thinker and others. They <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>by.</b> They wire that {{they will continue to}} stand by. Why on earth do they do that? Shall cable them to act.|$|E
60|$|FAITH. God's work in {{the soul}} showeth itself either to him that hath it or to standers by. To him that has it, it is shown by making him see and feel his own sins. To others who <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> it is shown by his life, a life of doing right {{in the sight of}} God. And now, sir, as to this brief account of the work of grace, and also the showing of it, if you have aught to object, object; if not, then give me leave to ask you a second question.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. If the Westons {{think it}} worth while {{to be at}} all this trouble {{for a few hours}} of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.--Oh! yes, I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins's week's account; much rather, I confess.--Pleasure in seeing dancing!--not I, indeed--I never look at it--I do not know who does.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward. Those who <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> are usually {{thinking}} of something very different." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "More {{than once}} the {{fishermen}} and sailors {{have tried to}} rescue prisoners {{on their way to}} execution. The commissioners of the republic have been hooted in the streets and, if they had had arms in their hands, our men would have turned the tables; but the town is full of troops now and, worse than all, they have enrolled this corps of volunteers, who are the terror of the place. They have spies everywhere, and no one dares whisper a word against the commissioners or the executions for, if but two or three men <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>by,</b> the chances are that {{one of them is a}} spy." ...|$|E
60|$|A night soon comes, {{when the}} mail, with echoing horn and blazing lamps, {{stops at the}} lodge-gate of Fairoaks, and Pen's trunks and his uncle's are placed {{on the roof of}} the carriage, into which the pair {{presently}} afterwards enter. Helen and Laura <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> the evergreens of the shrubbery, their figures lighted up by the coach lamps; the guard cries all right: in another instant the carriage whirls onward; the lights disappear, and Helen's heart and prayers go with them. Her sainted benedictions follow the departing boy. He has left the home-nest in which he has been chafing, and whither, after his very first flight, he returned bleeding and wounded; he is eager to go forth again, and try his restless wings.|$|E
60|$|Ah! here is {{a family}} just come in who {{recognise}} the flaxen-headed young gentleman; and the flaxen-headed young gentleman recognises them too, only he doesn't care to show it just now. Very well done indeed! He talks louder to the little group of military young gentlemen who <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> him, and coughs to induce some ladies in the next box but one to look round, in order that their faces may undergo the same ordeal of criticism {{to which they have}} subjected, in not a wholly inaudible tone, the majority of the female portion of the audience. Oh! a gentleman in the same box looks round as if he were disposed to resent this as an impertinence; and the flaxen-headed young gentleman sees his friends at once, and hurries away to them with the most charming cordiality.|$|E

60|$|We marched {{back to the}} Nile. The whole {{force had}} halted to drink, to eat, and to rest at Khor Shambat. The scene was striking. Imagine a six hundred yards stretch of the Suez Canal. Both banks are crowded with brown- or chocolate-clad figures. The {{northern}} side is completely covered with the swarming infantry of the British division. Thousands of animals--the horses of the cavalry, the artillery mules, the transport camels--fill the spaces and the foreground. Multitudes of khaki-clad men are sitting in rows on the slopes. Hundreds <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> the brim or actually in the red muddy water. All are drinking deeply. Two or three carcasses, lying in the shallows, show that the soldiers are thirsty rather than particular. On all sides water-bottles are being filled from the welcome Nile, which has come into the desert to refresh the weary animals and men.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the last}} scene, when Gerda and Hans <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> Vejle Fjord, {{mountains}} {{are present in}} the background. Denmark has no mountains. The scenes were shot at the Mount Mannen in Norway and at the Isle of Sheppey in England. This historical inaccuracy was a conscious choice by the director, who later apologized to Danish people for his mistake.|$|E
