As a goddess of poverty, frustration, and despair, Daniélou associates Dhumavati with Nirriti, the goddess of disease <b>and</b> <b>misery,</b> and Alakshmi, the goddess of misfortune and poverty. Kinsley adds another goddess to the list: Jyestha.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, the Settlement {{movement}} was founded, with settlements such as Toynbee Hall and Oxford House, to encourage university students {{to live and}} work in the slums, experience the conditions and try to alleviate some of the poverty <b>and</b> <b>misery</b> in the East End. Notable residents of Toynbee Hall included R. H. Tawney, Clement Attlee, Guglielmo Marconi, and William Beveridge. The Hall continues to exert considerable influence, with the Workers Educational Association (1903), Citizens Advice Bureau (1949) and Child Poverty Action Group (1965) all being founded or influenced by it. In 1888, the matchgirls of Bryant and May in Bow went on strike for better working conditions. This, combined with the many dock strikes in the same era, made the East End a key element in the foundation of modern socialist and trade union organisations, as well as the Suffragette movement.|$|E

5|$|Jack is {{contacted}} by Atlas via radio, and is guided to safety from the Splicers and {{the perils of}} the run down city. Atlas requests Jack's help in stopping Ryan, directing him to a docked bathysphere where he claims Ryan has trapped his family. When Jack encounters a wandering Little Sister and its fallen Big Daddy, Atlas urges Jack to kill the Little Sister to harvest her ADAM for himself; Dr. Tenenbaum overhears this and intercepts Jack before he harms the Little Sister, urging him to spare the child and any other Little Sisters he encounters, providing him with a plasmid that would force the sea slug out of her body. Jack eventually works {{his way to the}} bathysphere, but Ryan destroys it before Jack can reach it. Enraged, Atlas directs Jack towards Ryan's mansion through Ryan's army of Splicers and Big Daddies. At times, Jack is forced to travel through areas controlled by Ryan's allies that have now become deranged, such as Sander Cohen, a former musician that now takes enjoyment in watching the death <b>and</b> <b>misery</b> of others.|$|E
5|$|Ned {{invites the}} Simpson family to a {{barbecue}} party and announces {{his plans to}} open a store for left-handed people; The Leftorium. During the pulling of a wishbone, Homer, who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, wishes for The Leftorium to be a failure and go out of business. Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt <b>and</b> <b>misery.</b> Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts to regret what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the family living in their car. Homer wrestles with the guilt his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open the store for one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel to the store and buy things. The increase in customers helps Ned keep the store open and get his house back.|$|E

25|$|For most of {{his adult}} life Russell {{maintained}} that religion is little more than superstition and, despite any positive effects that religion might have, it is largely harmful to people. He believed religion and the religious outlook (he considered communism and other systematic ideologies to be forms of religion) serve to impede knowledge, foster fear and dependency, and are responsible for much of the war, oppression, <b>and</b> <b>misery</b> that have beset the world.|$|E
25|$|Another early {{example of}} a cryptic {{depiction}} is in Bertolt Brecht's 1941 play, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, in which Hitler, in the persona of the principal character Arturo Ui, a Chicago racketeer in the cauliflower trade, is ruthlessly satirised. Brecht, who was German but left when the Nazis came to power, also expressed {{his opposition to the}} National Socialist and Fascist movements in other plays such as Mother Courage and Fear <b>and</b> <b>Misery</b> of the Third Reich.|$|E

25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the Cold War, {{capitalism}} {{created a}} military horror: the neutron bomb, a weapon that destroys life while leaving buildings intact.

Breton insisted that Surrealism was an ongoing revolt against the reduction of humanity to market relationships, religious gestures <b>and</b> <b>misery</b> and to espouse the importance of liberating the human mind.|$|E

25|$|Many {{scholars}} {{think these}} numbers are exaggerated (records are inadequate, they are much larger than those from similar societies, soldiers were paid {{by the number of}} enemies they killed and the Han dynasty had an interest in exaggerating the bloodiness of the age before China was unified).

25|$|Two chance events helped spark Johnson's {{interest}} {{in politics and}} social questions, and convert him from a conventional business tycoon to a radical reformer. The first was reading, on {{the suggestion of a}} train conductor, Henry George's Social Problems, in which the political philosopher expounded his belief that poverty <b>and</b> <b>misery</b> were a result of society's newly created wealth becoming locked up in increasing land values, and advocating a Single Tax on land in place of wastefully taxing the productive activity of capital and labor.|$|E
25|$|Appayya Dikshita, a Shaiva theologian and {{proponent of}} Shiva Advaita, states that Shiva only awards {{happiness}} <b>and</b> <b>misery</b> {{in accordance with}} the law of karma. Thus persons themselves perform good or evil actions according to their own inclinations as acquired in past creations, and in accordance with those deeds, a new creation is made for the fulfilment of the law of karma. Shaivas believe that there are cycles of creations in which souls gravitate to specific bodies in accordance with karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of Siva alone.|$|E
