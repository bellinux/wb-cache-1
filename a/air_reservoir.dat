5|$|Many early {{suggestions}} {{focused on}} adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle, following {{the hypothesis that}} hadrosaurids were amphibious, a common line of thought until the 1960s. Thus, Alfred Sherwood Romer proposed it served as a snorkel, Martin Wilfarth {{that it was an}} attachment for a mobile proboscis used as a breathing tube or for food gathering, Charles M. Sternberg that it served as an airtrap to keep water out of the lungs, and Ned Colbert that it served as an <b>air</b> <b>reservoir</b> for prolonged stays underwater.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} {{hypotheses}} have been discredited or rejected. For example, {{there is no}} hole {{at the end of}} the crest for a snorkeling function. There are no muscle scars for a proboscis and it is dubious that an animal with a beak would need one. As a proposed airlock, it would not have kept out water. The proposed <b>air</b> <b>reservoir</b> would have been insufficient for an animal the size of Parasaurolophus. Other hadrosaurids had large heads without needing large hollow crests to serve as attachment points for supporting ligaments. Also, none of the proposals explain why the crest has such a shape, why other lambeosaurines should have crests that look much different but perform a similar function, how crestless or solid-crested hadrosaurids got along without such capabilities, or why some hadrosaurids had solid crests. These considerations particularly impact hypotheses based on increasing the capabilities of systems already present in the animal, such as the salt gland and olfaction hypotheses, and indicate that these were not primary functions of the crest. Additionally, work on the nasal cavity of lambeosaurines shows that olfactory nerves and corresponding sensory tissue were largely outside the portion of the nasal passages in the crest, so the expansion of the crest had little to do with the sense of smell.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} design a system without the {{shortcomings}} of the straight air system, Westinghouse invented a system wherein each piece of railroad rolling stock was equipped with an <b>air</b> <b>reservoir</b> and a triple valve, {{also known as a}} control valve.|$|E
5000|$|The Westinghouse {{air brake}} system. In this system, <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are {{provided}} on every vehicle and the locomotive charges the train pipe {{with a positive}} air pressure, which releases the vehicle brakes and charges the <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> on the vehicles. If the driver applies the brakes, his brake valve releases air from the train pipe, and triple valves at each vehicle detect the pressure loss and admit air from the <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> to brake cylinders, applying the brakes. The Westinghouse system uses smaller <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> and brake cylinders than the corresponding vacuum equipment, because a moderately high air pressure can be used. However, an air compressor is required to generate the compressed air and in the earlier days of railways, this required a large reciprocating steam air compressor, and this was regarded by many engineers as highly undesirable.|$|R

50|$|The Westinghouse {{system uses}} air {{pressure}} to charge <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> (tanks) on each car. Full air pressure signals each car {{to release the}} brakes. A reduction or loss of air pressure signals each car to apply its brakes, using the compressed <b>air</b> in its <b>reservoirs.</b>|$|R
25|$|An early diving dress using a {{compressed}} <b>air</b> <b>reservoir</b> {{was designed}} and built in 1771 by Sieur Fréminet of Paris who conceived an autonomous breathing machine equipped with a reservoir, dragged behind the diver or mounted on his back. Fréminet called his invention machine hydrostatergatique and used it successfully {{for more than ten}} years in the harbors of Le Havre and Brest, as stated in the explanatory text of a 1784 painting.|$|E
25|$|In 1860 {{a mining}} {{engineer}} from Espalion (France), Benoît Rouquayrol, invented a demand valve {{with an iron}} <b>air</b> <b>reservoir</b> to let miners breathe in flooded mines. He called his invention régulateur ('regulator'). In 1864 Rouquayol met the French Imperial Navy officer Auguste Denayrouze and they worked together to adapt Rouquayrol's regulator to diving. The Rouquayrol-Denayrouze apparatus was mass-produced with some interruptions from 1864 to 1965. As of 1865 it was acquired as a standard by the French Imperial Navy, but never was entirely accepted by the French divers {{because of a lack}} of safety and autonomy.|$|E
500|$|After the race, No. 460 {{went back}} to its normal duties until March 1937, when it was loaned to the Long Island Rail Road. In January 1939, No. 460 was {{returned}} to the Pennsylvania, but was still occasionally used on Long Island as a [...] "short term 'loaner'". Starting in 1942, it hauled trains between Camden and Bay Head, New Jersey. [...] In 1951, parts were taken of other E6s locomotives {{that were going to}} be scrapped: the drivers on the engineer's (right) side are from PRR 1565, the <b>air</b> <b>reservoir</b> on the fireman's (left) side was from PRR 690 and the reservoir on the engineer's side was from PRR 782. 460's tender was replaced in 1952 with one from 1565; the original tender had been transferred to maintenance-of-way service. 460 was leased to the PennsylvaniaReading Seashore Lines in 1953 before being retired in 1955 and added to the Pennsylvania's collection of historic locomotives in Northumberland, Pennsylvania.|$|E

2500|$|The train air-braking system, {{controlled}} by the driver, was fed from an <b>air</b> <b>reservoir</b> on the locomotive and, as the original locomotives were unable to generate their own compressed air, the reservoirs were recharged at Stockwell Station from an air line maintained at [...] Later, locomotives were fitted with compressors.|$|E
2500|$|Air guns {{have also}} been {{modified}} to convert them to firearms. The Brocock Air Cartridge System, for example, uses a self-contained [...] "cartridge" [...] {{roughly the size of}} a [...]38 Special cartridge, which contains an <b>air</b> <b>reservoir,</b> valve, and a [...]22 caliber (5.5mm) pellet. Examples of BACS airguns converted to firearms, either by drilling the barrel out to fire a [...]38 Special cartridge or by altering the cylinder to accept [...]22 caliber cartridges, have been used in a number of crimes. Blank-firing guns can also be converted by adding a barrel, although the low-quality alloys used for cheaper blank-firing guns may break with the pressures and stresses of a real bullet being fired.|$|E

With a full <b>air</b> <b>reservoir,</b> the Girardoni {{air rifle}} {{had the capacity to}} shoot 30 shots at useful pressure. These balls were effective to approximately 125 yd on a full <b>air</b> <b>reservoir.</b> The power declined as the <b>air</b> <b>reservoir</b> was emptied.|$|E
50|$|The {{air pump}} for the compressed-air brake was {{positioned}} {{at the front}} right, next to the smokebox, the <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> were {{on the right and}} left of the boiler and the silencer was fixed to the chimney.|$|R

5|$|In {{the initial}} design the battery box and <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> were located {{forward of the}} fuel tank; in {{locomotives}} manufactured after 1977 these were relocated behind the tank. The battery box returned to its original location in the F40PH-2. The F40PH-2s delivered to Caltrain incorporated Southern Pacific Railroad-style headlights.|$|R
50|$|The Westinghouse {{system uses}} <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> on each vehicle and {{compressed}} air is released from these reservoirs to the brake cylinders as {{the pressure in}} the train pipe is reduced by the driver operating the brake valve. This process causes a mechanical linkage to press the brake blocks against the wheels.|$|R
50|$|In EP operation, a distributor, {{performing}} functions {{similar to}} those of the triple valve, is operated directly and instantly by electrical control from the driver’s brake valve. The Westinghouse brake cylinders and <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> and pumps are used, so that only the means of transmitting the driver’s command is changed.|$|R

50|$|The Meillerwagen was {{equipped}} with two compressed <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> filled from the towing vehicle. These allowed the Meillerwagen to use its pneumatic brakes when it was unhitched from the tractor. In the unhitched mode, the Meillerwagen brakes were operated from the control valve handle, to provide braking ability during winching and hand-manoeuvring around the launch site.|$|R
2500|$|There was {{a crew of}} six at first: driver, driver's {{assistant}}, {{guard and}} three gatemen; the driver's assistant was subsequently eliminated. The trains used Westinghouse brakes, and the <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> were charged from static compressors at Waterloo. They were charged to , running down to [...] before needing to be recharged. Lighting was run off the power circuit, with four lamps in series from the [...] nominal.|$|R
50|$|One {{enhancement}} of the automatic air brake {{is to have}} a second air hose (the main reservoir or main line) along the train to recharge the <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> on each wagon. This air pressure {{can also be used to}} operate loading and unloading doors on wheat wagons and coal and ballast wagons. On passenger coaches, the main reservoir pipe is also used to supply air to operate doors and air suspension.|$|R
50|$|Regenerative braking is {{achieved}} by connecting an <b>air</b> <b>reservoir</b> to the crossover passage. During braking, energy is stored {{in the form of}} compressed air for later use.|$|E
5000|$|The Melodeon (not to be {{confused}} with the Diatonic button accordion of the same name) is a reed instrument with an <b>air</b> <b>reservoir</b> and a foot operated bellows. It was popular in the US in the mid-19th century.|$|E
5000|$|In its {{simplest}} form, {{a modern}} positive pressure ventilator {{consists of a}} compressible <b>air</b> <b>reservoir</b> or turbine, air and oxygen supplies, a set of valves and tubes, and a disposable or reusable [...] "patient circuit". The <b>air</b> <b>reservoir</b> is pneumatically compressed several times a minute to deliver room-air, or in most cases, an air/oxygen mixture to the patient. If a turbine is used, the turbine pushes air through the ventilator, with a flow valve adjusting pressure to meet patient-specific parameters. When over pressure is released, the patient will exhale passively due to the lungs' elasticity, the exhaled air being released usually through a one-way valve within the patient circuit called the patient manifold.|$|E

50|$|Since huge {{voltage drops}} are often {{encountered}} between electric sub-stations, the locomotive {{was designed to}} be able to operate on a supply varying between 55 and 25 kV AC. The battery boxes and the main <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are mounted between the bogies beneath the frame, where a compartment houses a small motor scooter for use by the crew for lineside inspections of the train, which can be up to nearly 4 km long.|$|R
