25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing {{progression of the}} disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death. Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol) have {{a large body of}} evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of angina. Calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (Adalat) and amlodipine), isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina. A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: Ivabradine provides pure heart rate reduction leading to major anti-ischemic and <b>antianginal</b> efficacy. ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque. Low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable angina, and was part of standard treatment. However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.|$|E

40|$|The {{composition}} and condition of membrane lipids, the morphology of erythrocytes, and hemoglobin distribution were explored {{with the help}} of laser interference microscopy (LIM) and Raman spectroscopy.

Furthermore, the microviscosity of the membranes and morphology of the erythrocytes are altered causing disordered oxygen transport by hemoglobin. Basic therapy carried out with the use of antiaggregants, statins, <b>antianginals,</b> beta-blockers, and calcium antagonists does not help to recover the morphofunctional properties of erythrocytes. Based on the results the authors assume that, for the relief of the ischemic crisis and further therapeutic treatment, it is necessary to include, in addition to cardiovascular disease medicines, medication that increases the ability of erythrocytes’ hemoglobin to transport oxygen to the tissues.

40|$|Abstract: Angina in {{the absence}} of obstructive {{coronary}} artery disease, sometimes referred to as cardiac syndrome X (CSX), is a debilitating condition that disproportionately affects women. More than 50 % of women evaluated for angina have non-obstructive disease by cardiac catheterization, although the total numbers of women affected by CSX are unknown. Varying clinical definitions and the lack of large scale epidemiologic studies focusing on this illness have resulted in limited knowledge about its risk factors, although there appears to be an association with black race, estrogen deficiency, and insulin resistance. Contrary to prior beliefs about the benign nature of this entity, these women suffer considerable morbidity with costly economic implications that approach the lifetime costs of healthcare utilization for those with obstructive coronary disease. Two prevailing hypotheses have emerged to explain CSX: the ischemic hypothesis detailing abnormal coronary microvascular function and the non-ischemic hypothesis describing altered pain perception and myocardial hypersensitivity. Treatment strategies have focused on both of these pathways with the main goal of improving symptoms. Beta blockers provide the most convincing evidence for benefit, with other <b>antianginals</b> having secondary roles. Other promising pharmacologic therapies include xanthine derivatives, estrogen replacement therapy, ACE inhibitors, and statin medications, among other emerging treatment options. Neurostimulation and lifestyle factors including exercise can also be beneficial in reducing symptoms. However, managing patients with CSX can be frustrating for both patients and physicians, as {{there is a lack of}} data regarding an optimal treatment algorithm including few large-scale randomized controlled trials to clarify effective therapies...|$|R
40|$|Phospholipidosis, a {{phospholipid}} storage disorder, defines {{an excessive}} accumulation of intracellular phospholipids. Phospholipids are structural components of mammalian cytoskeleton and cell membranes. The metabolism of this essential cell component is {{regulated by the}} individual cell and may be altered by drugs that interact with phospholipids or the enzymes that affect their metabolism. Xenobiotics or their metabolites that induce phospholipidosis include {{a wide variety of}} pharmacologic agents, including antibacterials, antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, <b>antianginals,</b> antimalarials, anorexic agents, cholesterol-lowering agents, and others. Each of these drugs shares several common physiochemical properties: hydrophobic ring structure on the molecule and a hydrophilic side chain with a charged cationic amine group, hence the class term cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs). This paper reviews the phospholipid metabolism, physiochemical characteristics of CADs, specificity of phospholipidosis in animals and humans, functional effects of phospholipidosis, interaction of CADs with biologic membranes and lysosome metabolism, influence of CADs on phos-pholipases and phospholipid synthesis, and a proposed mechanism for induction of phospholipidosis in the lung. In human risk assessment, investigators should consider the many factors in evaluating a drug that induces phospholipidosis in animals. These include: the therapeutic class of drug, presence of active metabolites, tissue or organ selectivity in animals and humans, influence of concurrently administered drugs, reversibility of effect, and other factors that increase or decrease the induction of phospholipidosis. Generalities regarding the etiology, incidence, and effect of the drug on a specific host may not be made. Each drug must be evaluated separately to identify the risk when administered for therapeutic effect in humans. Keywords.

EXPOSURES Stable CAD. Importance: In the era of widespread revascularization and effective <b>antianginals,</b> the prevalence and prognostic effect of anginal symptoms andmyocardial ischemia among patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) are unknown. Objective: To describe the current clinical patterns among patients with stable CAD and the association of anginal symptoms ormyocardial ischemia with clinical outcomes. Main outcome and Measure: The composite of cardiovascular (CV) -related death or nonfatalmyocardial infarction. Results: Overall, 4056 patients (20. 0 %) had anginal symptoms and 5242 (25. 8 %) had evidence of myocardial ischemia on results of noninvasive testing. Of 469 CV-related deaths ormyocardial infarctions, 58. 2 %occurred in patients without angina or ischemia, 12. 4 %in patients with ischemia alone, 12. 2 %in patients with angina alone, and 17. 3 %in patients with both. The hazard ratios for the primary outcome relative to patients without angina or ischemia and adjusted for age, sex, geographic region, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia were 0. 90 (95 %CI, 0. 68 - 1. 20; P =. 47) for ischemia alone, 1. 45 (95 %CI, 1. 08 - 1. 95; P =. 01) for angina alone, and 1. 75 (95 %CI, 1. 34 - 2. 29; P <. 001) for both.

40|$|Anti-ischemic therapy, in {{particular}} beta-blockers, {{is the most}} commonly employed drug for the control of myocardial ischemia in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Its widespread use also in patients with suspected coronary artery disease has important practical, clinical diagnostic and prognostic implications because diagnostic tests are heavily influenced by its effects. In the present review, the pathophysiological mechanisms of ischemia protection by <b>antianginal</b> therapy are described.
