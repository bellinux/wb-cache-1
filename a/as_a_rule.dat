5|$|Epilepsy is a {{group of}} {{neurological}} disorders characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rule,</b> have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition.|$|E

5000|$|The {{deduction}} <b>rule</b> is <b>an</b> important {{property of}} Hilbert-style systems because {{the use of}} this metatheorem leads to much shorter proofs than would be possible without it. Although the deduction theorem could be taken <b>as</b> <b>a</b> primitive <b>rule</b> of inference in such systems, this approach is not generally followed; instead, the deduction theorem is obtained <b>as</b> <b>an</b> admissible <b>rule</b> using the other logical axioms and modus ponens. In other formal proof systems, the deduction theorem is sometimes taken <b>as</b> <b>a</b> primitive <b>rule</b> of inference. For example, in natural deduction, the deduction theorem is recast <b>as</b> <b>an</b> introduction <b>rule</b> for [...] "→".|$|R

It was able to overcome these difficulties to some extent and to field {{tens of thousands of}} armed soldiers. Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the Warsaw Uprising, such as the Kubuś armored car). Even these light-infantry units were <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Rule 90 is an {{elementary}} cellular automaton. That {{means that it}} consists of a one-dimensional array of cells, each of which holds a single binary value, either 0 or 1. An assignment of values {{to all of the}} cells is called a configuration. The automaton is given an initial configuration, and then progresses through other configurations in a sequence of discrete time steps. At each step, all cells are updated simultaneously. A pre-specified rule determines the new value of each cell as a function of its previous value and of the values in its two neighboring cells. All cells obey the same rule, which may be given either as a formula or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> table that specifies the new value for each possible combination of neighboring values.|$|E

5|$|Several {{methods are}} known for {{defining}} cellular automata rules that are reversible; these include the block cellular automaton method, in which each update partitions the cells into blocks and applies an invertible function separately to each block, and the second-order cellular automaton method, in which the update rule combines states from two previous steps of the automaton. When an automaton is not defined by one of these methods, but is instead given <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> table, the problem of testing whether it is reversible is solvable for block cellular automata and for one-dimensional cellular automata, but is undecidable for other types of cellular automata.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Justice {{was headed}} by a Minister who was elected by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet between seasons, and {{authenticated}} by a Supreme Soviet convocation. Deputy Ministers were elected by the Council of Ministers; allocation of the deputies was decided by the Ministry of Justice. Each deputy usually headed {{his or her own}} department. The minister, the deputies, and other senior officials formed the leadership circle, known as the Board of the Ministry of Justice. The members of this board were approved by the Council of Ministers. The Board of the Ministry held meetings regularly to discuss legal matters nationwide. Decisions made by the board were <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> implemented nationwide. If the board disagreed they sought the assistance of the Council of Ministers to solve the problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{flexibility}} of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers {{to choose the}} fuel depending on current market prices. As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> of thumb, Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.|$|E

5|$|Fighting {{techniques}} differ {{amongst the}} bovid families and also {{depend on their}} build. While the hartebeest fight on knees, others usually fight on all fours. Gazelles of various sizes use different methods of combat. Gazelles usually box, and in serious fights may clash and fence, consisting of hard blows from short range. Ibex, goat and sheep males stand upright and clash into each other downwards. Wildebeest use powerful head butting in aggressive clashes. If horns become entangled, the opponents move in a circular manner to unlock them. Muskoxen will ram into each other at high speeds. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>rule,</b> only two bovids of equal build and level of defence engage in a fight, which is intended to determine the superior of the two. Individuals that are evidently inferior to others would rather flee than fight; for example, immature males do not fight with the mature bulls. Generally, bovids direct their attacks on the opponent's head rather than its body. The S-shaped horns, such as those on the impala, have various sections that help in ramming, holding, and stabbing. Serious fights leading to injury are rare.|$|E
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|E
5|$|Temples {{built in}} and around the Kalyani region (in the Bidar district) were quite {{different}} from those built in other regions. Without exception, the articulation was nagara, and the temple plan <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> was either stepped-diamond or stellate. The elevations corresponding to these two plans were similar because star shapes were produced by rotating the corner projections of a standard stepped plan in increments of 11.25 degrees, resulting in a 32-pointed interrupted plan in which three star points are skipped in the centre of each side of the shrine. Examples of stepped-diamond plans surviving in Karnataka are the Dattatreya Temple at Chattarki, the Someshvara Temple in Kadlewad, and the Mallikarjuna and Siddhesvara at Kalgi in the Gulbarga district. The nagara shrine at Chattarki is a stepped diamond of projecting corners with five projections per side. Because of the stepped-diamond plan, the wall pillars have two fully exposed sides, with a high base block decorated with a mirrored stalk motif and two large wall images above. The shapes and decorations {{on the rest of the}} wall pillar have a striking resemblance to the actual pillars supporting the ceiling.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between Link and Zelda {{was quite different}} from earlier incarnations, in particular the fact that Zelda was {{not a member of}} royalty. According to Aonuma, a recurring difficulty was how contrived the necessity for Link to rescue Zelda became with each passing installment, as their contact may only have been fleeting beforehand. In response to this, the team considered how to make the player care about Zelda and want to rescue her. Having the two characters as childhood friends both served this purpose and cut down on extraneous plot elements. They continued to encourage the player by having Link only just miss her on her early travels across the Surface. Mischievous elements were also added to Zelda's personality by her pushing Link over an ledge: initially intended <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> of three-style gag, it was cut down to two during development. The figure of Hylia was a new addition to the world's lore, although her existence was linked to Zelda, with the two being essentially the same character known under different names in subsequent ages. Groose, who acted as Link's rival, was introduced to make the story more interesting within the school setting. Groose's maturation {{during the course of the}} story was intended to help convey Link's parallel growth as a character as he was otherwise mute and static.|$|E
