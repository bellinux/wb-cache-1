40|$|Abstract—Averaging {{is widely}} used for {{approximating}} the dynamics of switched systems. The validity of <b>an</b> <b>averaged</b> model typically depends on the switching frequency and on some technicalities regarding the switched system structure. For homogeneous linear switched differential algebraic equations {{it is known that}} <b>an</b> <b>averaged</b> model can be obtained. In this paper <b>an</b> <b>averaging</b> result for non-homogeneous switched systems is presented. A switched electrical circuit illustrates the practical interest of the result. I...|$|R

40|$|A module {{endomorphism}} f on an algebra A {{is called}} <b>an</b> <b>averaging</b> operator if it satisfies f(xf(y)) = f(x) f(y) for any x, y∈ A.
