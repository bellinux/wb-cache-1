5|$|As Lincoln's {{election}} became evident, secessionists {{made clear}} their intent {{to leave the}} Union before he took office the next March. On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed. Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the Confederate States of America. The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, <b>and</b> <b>Arkansas)</b> listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal. The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional President on February 9, 1861.|$|E
5|$|As Southern {{states were}} subdued, {{critical}} decisions {{had to be}} made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee <b>and</b> <b>Arkansas,</b> where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being located}} in remote Scapa Flow, Battleship Division Nine {{was unable to}} avoid a global killer that struck just as World War I was coming to a close. Spanish Influenza—which killed {{millions}} worldwide in 1918–1919—did not spare the Grand Fleet. By late fall, an average of seven men per day were dying of the virus throughout the Fleet, and some ships were so badly affected that they were practically unmanageable. Though they were not as badly hit {{as some of the}} British vessels, the American battleships were not immune. By early November, only Florida was not in quarantine, <b>and</b> <b>Arkansas</b> had 259 cases, with 11 deaths.|$|E

5|$|In Mexico, Paine {{produced}} rainfall along {{much of the}} coastline, with maxima in inland Oaxaca, Jalisco, and Sonora {{where it}} moved ashore. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the remnants of Paine in the United States, there was an extended period of heavy rainfall, which caused at least 10deaths, forced thousands of people from their homes, and resulted in heavy flooding damage. The moisture from Paine produced the highest daily rainfall for any station in Oklahoma. Severe river flooding occurred along the Osage <b>and</b> <b>Arkansas</b> Rivers. The overall flooding event caused $350 million in damage, of which half came from crop losses.|$|E

In the fourth, Toledo scored 12 unanswered points for the win. Damon Nelson scored on a four-yard touchdown run and Hanna connected on field goals of 33 and 41 yards in the 43–28 win. The nine wins were the most won by a Toledo squad since the 1983 season.|$|E
5|$|Initially, oil {{production}} {{was conducted by}} many small producers. The early exploration and production frenzy produced an unstable supply of oil, which often resulted in overproduction. In the early years, a few major finds led to easy availability and major drops in prices, but were followed by limited exploration and a sudden spike in prices as production dwindled. The situation led exploration to spread into the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, <b>and</b> <b>Arkansas,</b> who competed with Texas for dominance in {{oil production}}. The strike at Glenn Pool near Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. oil production center until the 1930s. Though Texas soon lagged behind Oklahoma and California, {{it was still a}} major producer.|$|E
