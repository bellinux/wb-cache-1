5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{aviation}} design teams worldwide started {{developing a}} new generation of <b>all-metal,</b> low-wing fighter aircraft. The French Dewoitine D.520 and Germany's Messerschmitt Bf 109, for example, were designed to take advantage of new techniques of monocoque construction and the availability of new high-powered, liquid-cooled, in-line aero engines. They also featured refinements such as retractable undercarriages, fully enclosed cockpits, low drag and <b>all-metal</b> wings (all introduced on civil airliners years before but slow to be adopted by the military, who favoured the biplane's simplicity and manoeuvrability).|$|E
5|$|North American Aviation's first twin-engined {{military}} aircraft, the NA-21 prototype {{was constructed}} at North American's factory in Inglewood, California, where {{work on the}} aircraft began in early 1936. The NA-21 was a mid-wing monoplane of <b>all-metal</b> construction, powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-2180-A Twin Hornet radial engines, which were fitted with turbosuperchargers for increased high-altitude performance.|$|E
5|$|Several small {{manufacturers}} have produced replica Spitfires, either as complete aircraft, or as kits for self-building. These range in scale from ¾ full scale to full-size, although most use wooden construction, {{rather than the}} original <b>all-metal</b> monocoque design.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{clearly defined}} {{end to the}} ironclad, besides the {{transition}} from wood hulls to <b>all-metal.</b> Ironclads continued {{to be used in}} World War I. Towards the end of the 19th century, the descriptions 'battleship' and 'armored cruiser' came to replace the term 'ironclad'.|$|E
5|$|A mid-wing, <b>all-metal,</b> {{cantilever}} monoplane {{with two}} Pratt & Whitney Double Wasp radial engines mounted in streamlined nacelles under the wing, the XTSF-1 {{was intended to}} carry two crew members in tandem seats, and featured an internal bomb bay and a SCR-720 radar set, the radar later being replaced in the design by an AN/APS-3 or AN/APS-4 set. A second seat was added for the radar operator.|$|E
5|$|The Ju 87 was a single-engined <b>all-metal</b> {{cantilever}} monoplane. It had a fixed undercarriage {{and could}} carry a two-person crew. The main construction material was duralumin, and the external coverings {{were made of}} Duralumin sheeting. Parts that were required to be of strong construction, such as the wing flaps, were made of Pantal (a German aluminum alloy containing titanium as a hardening element) and its components made of Elektron. Bolts and parts that were required to take heavy stress were made of steel.|$|E
5|$|The Comet was an <b>all-metal</b> low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane {{powered by}} four jet engines; {{it had a}} four-place cockpit occupied by two pilots, a flight engineer, and a navigator. The clean, low-drag design of the aircraft featured many design elements that were fairly uncommon at the time, including a swept-wing leading edge, integral wing fuel tanks, and four-wheel bogie main undercarriage units designed by de Havilland. Two pairs of turbojet engines (on the Comet 1s, Halford H.2 Ghosts, subsequently known as de Havilland Ghost 50 Mk1s) were buried into the wings.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} swept wing <b>all-metal</b> monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, <b>all-metal,</b> two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had mid-mounted straight laminar flow wings and the engine nacelles were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the wing spars continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and high-strength steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically actuated air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E
5|$|To {{prove the}} {{soundness}} of the IAe 33 design, two gliders built under contract by another expatriate, Reimar Horten, were constructed {{and used for}} aerodynamics testing in 1948–1949, including flights by Tank himself. These tests revealed significant problems with lateral stability, resulting in modifications to the tail {{to address this problem}} before construction began on two prototype airframes. Due to the lack of modern machinery, the <b>all-metal</b> fabrication relied heavily on handcrafting, and fabricating the prototypes was a labor-intensive procedure. President Perón envisioned that a benefit of setting up an aviation factory in Argentina would be to introduce production standards comparable to world-class manufacturing facilities. However, Tank realized that production tools and jigs were not feasible at this stage and relied instead on essentially hand-built examples. The first airframe (No. 01) reserved for static testing, was subsequently destroyed during the tests.|$|E
25|$|The Zeppelin-Staaken E-4/20 was {{a revolutionary}} four-engine <b>all-metal</b> {{passenger}} monoplane designed in 1917 by Adolf Rohrbach and completed in 1919 at the Zeppelin-Staaken works outside Berlin, Germany. The E-4/20 {{was the first}} four-engine, <b>all-metal</b> stressed skin heavier-than-air airliner built.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, {{fears about the}} safety of wooden {{aircraft}} structures drove the US aviation industry to develop <b>all-metal</b> airliners. United Airlines had exclusive right to the all metal twin-engine Boeing 247; rival TWA issued a specification for an <b>all-metal</b> trimotor.|$|E
25|$|XO-6: Five <b>all-metal</b> O-2s, {{built in}} the mid-1920s by Thomas-Morse.|$|E
25|$|<b>All-metal</b> low-wing land {{monoplane}} {{with four}} wing-mounted low-bypass turbofan engines.|$|E
25|$|The Junkers G 31 was an {{advanced}} tri-motor airliner produced in small numbers in Germany in the 1920s. Like other Junkers types, {{it was an}} <b>all-metal,</b> low-wing cantilever monoplane. Compared to modern aircraft, only the corrugated duralumin metal skin, so typical for Junkers aircraft, seems unusual. However, in the mid-1920s <b>all-metal</b> construction and an aerodynamically 'clean' configuration were remarkable.|$|E
