40|$|For {{the large}} <b>Arcto-Norwegian</b> stock of <b>cod</b> (Gadus morhua L.) in the Barents Sea, year-to-year {{variability}} in growth is well documented. Here three hypotheses for the observed inverse relation between abundance {{and the mean}} length-at-age of juveniles (ages 1 – 4) are suggested and evaluated. Based on comprehensive data, we conclude that year-to-year differences in length-at-age are mainly determined by density-independent mechanisms during the pelagic first half year of the fishes’ life. Enhanced inflow from the southwest leads to an abundant cohort at the 0 - group stage being distributed farther east into colder water masses, causing lower postsettlement growth rates. We can not reject density-dependent growth effects related to variability in food rations, but our data do not suggest {{this to be the}} main mechanism. Another hypothesis suggests that lower growth rates during periods of high abundance are a result of density-dependent mechanisms causing the geographic range of juveniles to extend eastwards into colder water masses. This is rejected mainly because year-to-year differences in mean length are established by age 2, which is too early for movements over large distances...|$|R
40|$|Atlantic Cod (Gadus morhua) {{is one of}} {{the commercially}} most {{important}} fish species in the North Atlantic and plays a central role in several ecosystems. Fishing pressure has been heavy over a prolonged period and the recent decades have shown dramatic decline in abundance of many stocks. The <b>Arcto-norwegian</b> (northeast Arctic) <b>cod</b> stock in the Barents Sea is now the largest. We show that the age composition of the spawning stock has changed distinctly during the last 60 years, the average age of spawners has decreased from between 10 and 11 in the late 1940 s to 7 - 8 now. Although less clear, there is also a tendency towards reduced age diversity in the spawning stock, fewer age classes now contributing. The trend towards a younger, less diverse spawning stock is worrying, in particular since earlier work by other authors has thoroughly documented that older Barents Sea cod produce disproportionately more and higher quality eggs than first-time spawners. There is evidence for fluctuations in climate, particularly sea temperature, being a main cause for the pronounced recruitment variability of this stock, higher temperatures being favourable for survival throughout the critical early life stages. We document, through studies of time series, that the climate-cod recruitment link has strengthened during the last decades. Our results suggest that this is a result of cod now being less resilient to adverse climate conditions due to the reduction in spawning stock age and age diversity...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Radiocarbon {{measured}} in seawater {{dissolved inorganic carbon}} (DIC) {{can be used to}} investigate ocean circu-lation, atmosphere/ocean carbon flux, and provide powerful constraints for the fine-tuning of general circulation models (GCMs). Time series of 14 C in seawater are derived most frequently from annual bands of hermatypic corals. However, this proxy is unavailable in temperate and polar oceans. Fish otoliths, calcium carbonate auditory, and gravity receptors in the membranous labyrinths of teleost fishes, can act as proxies for 14 C in most oceans and at most depths. <b>Arcto-Norwegian</b> <b>cod</b> otoliths are suited to this application due to the well-defined distribution of this species in the Barents Sea, the ability to deter-mine ages of individual <b>Arcto-Norwegian</b> <b>cod</b> {{with a high level of}} accuracy, and the availability of archived otoliths collected for fisheries research over the past 60 years.

40|$|The <b>Arcto-Norwegian</b> <b>cod</b> is {{spawning}} in {{the temperature}} stable Atlantic water, and the eggs ascend {{into the more}} temperature variable coastal water. Changes in time of peak spawning, up to 10 days within the last 60 years, are caused by changes in the cod´s age composition, peak spawning of first-time spawners being somewhat delayed. In contrast, the peak spawning in the coastal water of Calanus finmarchicus, whose nauplii are the almost exclusively food organism for the first feeding cod larvae, vary with more than 40 days due to temperature variations. It is a clear tendency {{for the majority of}} nauplii abundance peaks to be situated ahead of the peak first feeding cod larvae, especially during warm years. The temperature covariate in the spawning areas in the Norwegian coastal waters and the feeding areas of cod in the Barents Sea. High temperatures during the egg and larval stages favour the feeding condition of the larvae hatched first, since the concentration of nauplii is higher {{in the first part of}} the larval period. These larvae from the larger, high fecund cod females, are the largest and probably the most viable larvae produced during the season. During periods of decreasing temperatures in the feeding areas and the spawning sites, the production of viable larvae is more variable. High temperatures also improve and extend the feeding areas tn the Barents Sea, giving support for larger year-classes. In both temperature regimes the age compostition of the spawning population of <b>Arcto-Norwegian</b> <b>cod</b> will effect the degree of match between the production cycle of nauplii and first feeding cod larvae.

40|$|The year class {{strength}} of <b>Arcto-Norwegian</b> <b>cod</b> (Gadus morhua L.) in the Barents Sea is extremely variable.

Thus it is conjectured that when there is a strong flow of Atlantic water from the Norwegian Sea into the Barents Sea it not only warms the water but transports large quantities of zooplankton and hence provides better survival conditions for cod. Survey data from the Barents Sea for the years 1977 through 1984 are examined to determine the relation between zooplankton abundance and the spatial distribution of juvenile cod and to investigate if zooplankton abundance is associated with the flow of Atlantic water. For all years, more zooplankton on average were found in areas with cod than in those without cod.

40|$|The year class {{strength}} of the <b>Arcto-Norwegian</b> <b>cod</b> is mainly determined during the early life stages.

The fatty acid composition of lipids in marine animals reflects both the diets and bio-synthetic activities of the animals. The fatty acid composition of the most important prey items can be used as an indicator of the dietary lipids intake of the cod larvae. The fatty acids of total lipid were analysed from phytoplankton, eggs and nauplii of Calanus finmarchicus and cod eggs and larvae from Lofoten waters.

This was not found in 1992 when egg groups from cod females in all stages of spawning were used. The maternal effect of cod female size was compared to the effect of stage of spawning. This comparison revealed the following tentative conclusions: 1) The egg diameter is less affected by the length of the cod female than by its stage of spawning. 2) The fertilization percentage and larval activity are correlated with the stage of spawning of the cod female, but not to its length. The present results indicate that the maternal effect of individual changes in egg characteristics during spawning is larger than the maternal effect of cod female size.

From 6 February to 30 March 1974 during the spawning migration of <b>Arcto-Norwegian</b> <b>cod,</b> a fishing {{experiment with}} gill nets made of continuous multifilament nylon, nylon monofilament and nylon monotwine {{was carried out}} in Lofoten. The different types of nets were combined to make upone gill net setting consisting of 40 to 92 single nets, half of which were multifilament nylon nets and one quarter each monofilament and monotwine nets. The sequence of the single nets was varied during the experiment. The result for the total experiment was that the monofilament nets caught 26 % (in numbers) more cod than the multifilament nylon nets and 38 % more than the monotwine nets. For saithe the monotwine nets were apparently the most and the multifilament nylon nets the least efficient. The average length of the captured fish was slightly higher for the multifilament nylon than for the monofilament nets whereas the fish caught by the monotwine nets were somewhat smaller. Taking the length frequency of cod caught by purse seine in the same area during the experiment as representative for the cod available to the gill nets, a log-normal distribution selection curve was fitted {{for each of the three}} types of gill nets. The mesh size used in the experiment (186 mm) was clearly too small to obtain maximum catches of the available cod. Assuming proportionality between mesh size and mean selection length gave optimum mesh sizes of 224 mm for nylon, 222 mm for monofilament and 234 mm for monotwine. The ratios between the theoretical maximum catches thus obtained were: Monofilament: Nylon = 1. 46; Monotwine: Nylon = 1. 48; Monotwine: Monofilament = 1. 02. Assuming that all length groups are equally numerous among the cod available to the nets, ratios between the catch efficiency of the three nets, which should represent a more general situation, were calculated, giving: Monofilament: Nylon = 1. 23; Monotwine: Nylon = 1. 15; Monofilament: Monotwine = 1. 07.

Unlike in Munro (1979), where conflicts in the management strategies of agents arise from differences in the perceptions of the discount factor, fishing effort costs, and consumer preferences, here conflicts arise mainly from the differences in fishing gear and grounds, and the age group of cod targeted by the two agents. Using a game theoretic framework, we show that given available data, the optimum optimorum is obtained under cooperation with side payments and no predetermined harvest shares, in which case the coastal fishery buys out the trawl fishery. However, sensitivity analysis shows that if the price premium assumed for mature cod is taken away, the trawl fishery takes over as the producer of the optimum optimorum.

40|$|<b>Arcto-Norwegian</b> <b>cod</b> tend {{to produce}} strong year classes in warm years and poor year classes in cold years. This work shows that {{spawning}} intensity at various spawning sites along 1500 km of Norwegian coast is {{also influenced by}} climate variations. However, while the recruitment response to temperature is immediate and on an interannual time-scale, the response to changes in spawning site is slower, on a multidecadal time-scale. There have been two cold and two warm periods during the 20 th century, cold from 1900 to 1920, warm from 1930 to 1950, cold from 1960 to 1970, and warm since the mid- 1980 s. A time-series for 1900 – 1976 on cod roe indices along the coast shows that the southernmost spawning areas are more important during cold periods, and the northernmost ones in warm periods, and coincide with high population fecundity. After 1976, qualitative observations show {{that there have been}} poor spawning fisheries in the southernmost spawning areas during the present warm period. From 2003, spawning has been observed along the coast of East Finnmark where it did not transpire during the previous 40 years...|$|E
40|$|Specific {{growth rates}} and {{survival}} {{were not significantly}} different among the pelagic juveniles of three electrophoretically distinguishable stocks of Norwegian cod (Gadus morhua), co-reared in four replicate 5. 2 m 3 mesocosms, from hatch to day 38 or day 43 post-hatch. <b>Arcto-Norwegian</b> <b>cod</b> (AC, the main commercial cod stock which spawn in Lofoten and are distributed in the Barents Sea, mostly north of 70 N), were compared with a nearby coastal stock (Balsfjord cod, BC – from a fjord near Tromsø at 6930 N), and a more southern coastal cod stock (CC, from near Bergen at 60 N). The increment width series of the lapillus – otolith growth history – and the relative daily growth rate {{were not significantly different}} among stocks within any mesocosm. Although AC larvae were larger, being derived from larger brood stock, they did not exhibit consistently greater otolith growth during the experiment. Larger size at harvest was correlated with growth during the latter part of rearing (>fourth week), which is when most differences in size at age are generated. Decreases in daily increment widths occurred in all stocks within 1 – 2 days, when the zooplankton food supply was changed from nauplii and copepodites to adult copepods, and when th...|$|E
40|$|A high {{growth rate}} for <b>Arcto-Norwegian</b> <b>cod</b> (Gadus morhua L.) in the Barents Sea and {{adjacent}} areas from the larval stage to the 0 -group stage enhances survival and ultimately recruitment to the fishery. However, {{it appears that}} relatively high growth rates for a cohort through the 0 -group stage are not continued as the cohort ages. Based on survey data, there is a negative, though not significant, correlation between a cohort’s average length at the 0 -group stage and its average length as 1 year olds and a significant negative correlation between the average length at the 0 -group stage and its average length at ages 2 through 9. It appears {{that the reason for}} this slowing of growth is that a strong inflow of warm, prey-rich Atlantic water into the Barents Sea from the Norwegian Sea provides favorable conditions for growth a”nl’d hence survival of the cod larvae and juveniles. But this same strong inflow cakes a proportion of the cohort farther to the east in the Barents Sea, where the bottom water is colder than in the west. Thus the young settled cod experience colder conditions, which slows their growth, than those cohorts that have a more westerly settlement, and this slow growth before age 2 appears to be the reason for the cohort’s relatively smaller mean length at older ages...|$|E
40|$|The year-class {{strength}} of the <b>Arcto-Norwegian</b> <b>cod</b> stock varies {{on an annual basis}} by a factor of about 20 : 1 and is determined at the 0 -group stage (about 1 / 2 year old cod). Since the number of eggs spawned far exceeds the number of 0 -group cod, there must be an enormous mortality during the first half year. The aim of the present project is to test Hjort's hypothesis and to increase out knowledge about the growth and survival of cod larvae. The main area of investigation is Vestfjorden in northwestern Norway. Several aspects of the larvae were examined, such as standard length, functional jaw, yolk sac stages, development of swim-bladder, gut content, etc. The results of bioassay experiments showed that first feeding cod larvae were able to capture nauplii even at very low prey densities. However, feeding incidence never exceeded 80 % at the highest prey densities (50 - 60 nauplii/l) even in the most developed larvae. The size range of nauplii eaten by cod larvae is seemingly uncorrelated to larval length at first-feeding. The larvae seemed to avoid the smallest sized particles and were possibly unable to eat the largest particles. First-feeding cod larvae seem to select nauplii within the size of 120 - 130 mu m (carapax length). The majority of first-feeding cod larvae in Lofoten were distributed in the upper 20 m...|$|E
40|$|We sampled 0 -group {{juvenile}} Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L. within fjords {{and offshore}} in northern Norway from 1994 to 2008 using different gears for the 3 sampling depths: shore seine (0 − 3 m), pelagic trawl (various depths), and bottom trawl (> 80 m). Frequencies of alleles at the Pan I locus (4218 fish analysed) showed highly {{significant differences among}} samples collected in the different habitats. The Pan IA allele showed a mean frequency of ~ 80 % in the shore seine samples, 12 % in the bottom trawl samples, and between 5 and 57 % in the pelagic samples. These differences are thought to reflect the co-occurrence of different populations of cod in the area with different settling regimes. Shallow-water settlers are thought to represent the stationary Norwegian coastal cod (NCC), the deep-water settlers represent the migratory <b>Arcto-Norwegian</b> <b>cod</b> (ANC), and the non-settled individuals represent a variable mixture of the 2 populations. For designated samples, we analyzed 16 microsatellites (non-neutral and neutral) that supported a genetic divergence between shallow-water and deep-water settlers. Correlations between length and Pan I genotypes within selected samples showed that the Pan IBB homozygotes (typical of ANC) were significantly longer than the Pan IAA homozygotes (typical of NCC). This could reflect differences in spawning time and growth conditions between ANC and NCC, {{just as well as}} one genotype being superior to the others in terms of growth performance. Finally, we argue that the Pan I difference between 0 -group NCC and ANC is not caused by contemporary selection but reflects adaptation on an ecological post-glacial time scale...|$|E
