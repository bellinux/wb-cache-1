In replying to the headmaster’s speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926, the King said: The headmaster is right in assuming that I am already well acquainted with Mr Ferens’s benefactions {{in other parts of}} the country; this is not the first time I have been associated with him in this manner, <b>and</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> know the last thing that he would want would be a public expression of thanks on my part, I would like to be allowed to share in the debt of gratitude which the Kingswood School owes him today.|$|E
25|$|In {{two days}} after the {{execution}} of Robespierre, the whole commune of Paris, consisting of about sixty persons, were guillotined in less than one hour and a half, in the Place de la Revolution; <b>and</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was standing above a hundred paces from the place of execution, the blood of the victims streamed under my feet.|$|E
25|$|After {{this had}} the king a large meeting, and very deep {{consultation}} with his council, about this land; {{how it was}} occupied, and by what sort of men. Then sent he his men over all England into each shire; commissioning them to find out 'How many hundreds of hides were in the shire, what land the king himself had, and what stock upon the land; or, what dues {{he ought to have}} by the year from the shire.' Also he commissioned them to record in writing, 'How much land his archbishops had, and his diocesan bishops, and his abbots, and his earls;' <b>and</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> may be prolix and tedious, 'What, or how much, each man had, who was an occupier of land in England, either in land or in stock, and how much money it were worth.' So very narrowly, indeed, did he commission them to trace it out, that there was not one single hide, nor a yard of land, nay, moreover (it is shameful to tell, though he thought it no shame to do it), not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine was there left, that was not set down in his writ. And all the recorded particulars were afterwards brought to him.|$|E

500|$|Two {{weeks before}} the March 12 primary, an {{internal}} poll showed Romney losing to Nixon by a six-to-one margin in New Hampshire. [...] Rockefeller, seeing the poll result as well, publicly maintained his support for Romney but {{said he would be}} available for a draft; the statement made national headlines and embittered Romney (who would later claim it was Rockefeller's entry, and not the [...] "brainwashing" [...] remark, that doomed him). [...] Seeing his cause was hopeless, Romney announced his withdrawal as a presidential candidate on February 28, 1968. [...] Romney wrote his son Mitt, still away on missionary work: [...] "Your mother and I are not personally distressed. As a matter of fact, we are relieved. ... I aspired, <b>and</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> achieved not, I am satisfied." ...|$|E
500|$|They {{reached the}} edge of a wood, close to the Temple de l'Amour, and came across a man seated beside a garden kiosk, wearing a cloak and large shady hat. According to Moberly, his {{appearance}} was [...] "most repulsive... its expression odious. His complexion was dark and rough." [...] Jourdain noted [...] "The man slowly turned his face, which was marked by smallpox; his complexion was very dark. The expression was evil and yet unseeing, <b>and</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> did not feel that he was looking particularly at us, I felt a repugnance to going past him. A man later described as [...] "tall... with large dark eyes, and crisp curling black hair under a large sombrero hat" [...] came up to them, and showed them the way to the Petit Trianon.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{opinion was}} split about Lazenby; {{he has been}} {{considered}} {{to have been the}} worst Bond, and has variously been described as [...] "laconic and humourless", [...] "a little stiff" [...] and [...] "annoying and smug". Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he [...] "is not a good actor <b>and</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, there are moments when one yearns for a little of his louche panache". The New York Times critic AH Weiler also weighed in against Lazenby, saying that [...] "Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement". Pauline Kael called Lazenby [...] "quite a dull fellow" [...] in her otherwise positive review in The New Yorker. However, Peter R. Hunt, director of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, stated that Lazenby should have undertaken more films in the role, saying [...] "he would have made a very credible Bond and been very good indeed".|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of reviews were critical {{of either the}} film, Lazenby, or both, {{while most of the}} contemporary reviews in the British press referred to George Lazenby at some point as [...] "The Big Fry", a reference to his previous acting in [...] Fry's Chocolate [...] advertisements. Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he [...] "is not a good actor <b>and</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, there are moments when one yearns for a little of his louche panache." [...] For all the criticism of Lazenby, however, Malcolm says that the film was [...] "quite a jolly frolic in the familiar money-spinning fashion". Tom Milne, writing in The Observer was even more scathing, saying that [...] "I... fervently trust (OHMSS) will be the last of the James Bond films. All the pleasing oddities and eccentricities and gadgets of the earlier films have somehow been lost, leaving a routine trail through which the new James Bond strides without noticeable signs of animation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nabucco is {{the opera}} which is {{considered}} to have permanently established Verdi's reputation as a composer.

2500|$|In the {{following}} years {{the role of the}} Angel was more often taken by the leading English contralto Louise Kirkby Lunn, also a celebrated Wagnerian singer (Ortrud, Kundry, Brangane and Fricka), Amneris and Dalilah, and in many ways a successor to Marie Brema, though without her range for a compelling Brünnhilde. In 1903, writing to Brema of her original performance, Elgar wrote 'I have, of course, in memory your fine and intellectual creation of the part; <b>and</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> never thought the 'tessitura' suited you well, as the magnificent artist you are, you made it go very finely.' ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Borlaug, [...] "Africa, {{the former}} Soviet republics, and the cerrado {{are the last}} frontiers. After they are in use, the world will have no {{additional}} sizable blocks of arable land left to put into production, unless {{you are willing to}} level whole forests, which you should not do. So, future food-production increases will have to come from higher yields. <b>And</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> have no doubt yields will keep going up, whether they can go up enough to feed the population monster is another matter. Unless progress with agricultural yields remains very strong, the next century will experience sheer human misery that, on a numerical scale, will exceed the worst of everything that has come before".|$|E
2500|$|..... {{one of the}} Methodist preachers ... treated my {{communication}} ... {{with great}} contempt, saying it was all of the devil, {{that there were no}} such things as visions or revelations in these days; that all such things had ceased with the apostles, and that there would never be any more of them. I soon found, however, that my telling the story had excited a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion, and was the cause of great persecution, which continued to increase; <b>and</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was an obscure boy, only between fourteen and fifteen years of age, and my circumstances in life such as to make a boy of no consequence in the world, yet men of high standing would take notice sufficient to excite the public mind against me, and create a bitter persecution; and this was common among all the sects—all united to persecute me.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 December, Robert Barton was {{questioned}} by Kevin O'Higgins about his notes on Lloyd George's statement about signing the agreement or facing {{a renewal of}} war: [...] "Did Mr Lloyd George single Mr Barton out as the left wing of the delegation and did he say, 'The man who is against peace may bear now and forever the responsibility for terrible and immediate war?'" [...] Barton replied: [...] "What he did say was that the signature and the recommendation of {{every member of the}} delegation was necessary, or war would follow immediately and that the responsibility for that war must rest directly upon those who refused to sign the Treaty". This was seized upon by opponents of the treaty as a convenient proof that the Irish delegates had been subjected to duress at the last minute, and [...] "terrible and immediate war" [...] became a catch-phrase in the debates that followed. The next day, de Valera took up this point: [...] "... therefore what happened was that over there a threat of immediate force upon our people was made. I believe that that document was signed under duress <b>and,</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> have a moral feeling that any agreement entered into ought to be faithfully carried out, I have no hesitation in saying that I would not regard it as binding on the Irish nation." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{think it}} was the first summer I was at Harvard as a student, and I {{discovered}} a wonderful bookstore there where I could get modern poetry – which I'd never been able to lay my hands on very much until then – and they had the original edition of The Darkening Ecliptic with the Sidney Nolan cover. [...] I always had a taste for sort of wild experimental poetry – of which there really wasn't very much in English in America at the time – and this poet suited me very well. [...] I am obliged to give a final examination in my poetry writing course , which I'm always rather hard put to do, since we haven't really studied anything. The students have been writing poems of varying degrees of merit, <b>and</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> give them reading lists they tend to ignore them, after first demanding them. And the way the course is set up {{there is no way of}} examining them on their reading. And anyway they shouldn't have to pass an examination because they're poets who are writing poetry, and I don't like the idea of grading poems. So in order to pass the examination time I had to think of various subterfuges, and one of them is to use one of Malley's poems and another forbiddingly modern poem – frequently one of Geoffrey Hill's 'Mercian Hymns'. And asking them if they can guess which one is the real poem by a respected contemporary poet, and which one is a put-on intended to ridicule modern poetry, and what are their reasons. And I think they are right about fifty per cent of the time, identifying the fraud... fraudulent poem.|$|E
