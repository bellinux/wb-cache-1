5|$|The worst mining {{disaster}} in the town occurred at Yew Tree Colliery on 11 December 1858 when <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> firedamp caused by a safety lamp cost 25 lives, the youngest victim was 11, and the oldest, 35 years of age. Some of the victims are buried in the churchyard at St George's Church. Another explosion on 6 March 1877 at Great Boys Colliery cost eight lives and on 2 October 1883, six men died when the cage rope broke at Nelson Colliery in Shakerley. On 1 October 1895 five men including the colliery manager and undermanager died at Shakerley Colliery after <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> firedamp.|$|E
5|$|Before 1840, {{women and}} {{children}} were employed in coal mines and there were frequent accidents. The worst disaster occurred in 1825 at the Gosforth Pit, named after the Brandling's Durham estate, where <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> firedamp caused 24 deaths; the oldest a collier aged 48 and the youngest a child of seven.|$|E

5|$|Hubble's law has two {{possible}} explanations. Either {{we are at}} the center of <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> galaxies—which is untenable given the Copernican principle—or the universe is uniformly expanding everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922 and Georges Lemaître in 1927, well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker.|$|E
5|$|Media {{attention}} {{centred on}} sabotage, while other speculation ranged from clear-air turbulence to <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> vapour {{in an empty}} fuel tank. The Abell Committee focused on six potential aerodynamic and mechanical causes: control flutter (which had led {{to the loss of}} DH 108 prototypes), structural failure due to high loads or metal fatigue of the wing structure, failure of the powered flight controls, failure of the window panels leading to explosive decompression, or fire and other engine problems. The committee concluded that fire was the most likely cause of the problem, and a number of changes were made to the aircraft to protect the engines and wings from damage that might lead to another fire.|$|E
5|$|Paris was {{the centre}} of <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> philosophic and {{scientific}} activity known as the Age of Enlightenment. Diderot and d'Alembert published their Encyclopédie in 1751–52, and the Montgolfier Brothers launched the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 November 1783, from the gardens of the Château de la Muette. Paris was the financial capital of continental Europe, the primary European centre of book publishing, fashion and the manufacture of fine furniture and luxury goods.|$|E

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) {{conducted}} {{joint research}} to evaluate explosion blast effects on typical U. S. mine ventilation stoppings in the NIOSH Pittsburgh Research Laboratory 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s (PRL) Lake Lynn Experimental Mine (LLEM). An innovative Australian-designed brattice stop-ping was also evaluated. After mine explosion accidents, MSHA conducts investigations {{to determine the}} cause(s) {{as a means to}} prevent future occurrences. As part of these postexplosion investigations, the condition of underground stoppings, including the debris from damaged stoppings, is documented as evidence of the approximate strength and the direction <b>of</b> the <b>explosion</b> forces. The LLEM data showed that a typical dry-stacked and coated solid-concrete-block stopping survived <b>a</b> total <b>explosion</b> pressure <b>of</b> 6. 7 psi (46 kPa) and was destroyed at <b>a</b> total <b>explosion</b> pressure <b>of</b> 7. 6 psi (52 kPa). In comparison, a typical dry-stacked and coated hollow-core concrete block stopping survived <b>a</b> total <b>explosion</b> pressure <b>of</b> 3. 4 - 4. 3 psi (23 - 30 kPa) and was destroyed at <b>a</b> total <b>explosion</b> pressure <b>of</b> 3. 6 - 5. 2 psi (25 - 36 kPa), depending on the length of the pressure pulse and the value of the pressure-time integral. A typical steel panel stopping design survived <b>a</b> total <b>explosion</b> pressure <b>of</b> 0. 8 psi (5. 5 kPa) and failed at <b>a</b> total <b>explosion</b> pressure <b>of</b> 1. 3 psi (9 kPa). The LLEM data also showed that an obstacle blocking the path of a pressure wave resulted in a higher reflected pressure at the obstacle. An 8 -in (20 -cm) thick wet-laid solid-concrete-block stopping coated on one side survived <b>a</b> total <b>explosion</b> pressure <b>of</b> 26 psi (180 kPa); this stopping was not tested to failure. A 6 -in (15 -cm) thick wet-laid solid-concrete-block stopping coated on one side survived <b>a</b> total <b>explosion</b> pressure <b>of</b> 14 psi (97 kPa) and was destroyed at <b>a</b> total <b>explosion</b> pressure <b>of</b> 25 psi (172 kPa). An innovative Australian woven cloth stopping survived <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> pressure <b>of</b> 4. 0 psi (27 kPa) and was destroyed at <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> pressure <b>of</b> 6. 1 psi (42 kPa). These results will help investigators determine the approximate explosion forces that destroy or damage stoppings during actual coal mine explosions...|$|R
5|$|The Big Bang is not <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> matter moving outward to fill {{an empty}} universe. Instead, space itself expands with time {{everywhere}} {{and increases the}} physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, the Big Bang is not an explosion in space, but rather an expansion of space. Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, {{there was}} <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> new lemur {{descriptions}} and names, which later took decades to sort out. During this time, professional collectors gathered specimens for museums, menageries, and cabinets. Some {{of the major}} collectors were Johann Maria Hildebrandt and Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major. From these collections, as well as increasing observations of lemurs in their natural habitats, museum systematists including Albert Günther and John Edward Gray continued to contribute new names for new lemur species. However, the most notable contributions from this century includes the work of Alfred Grandidier, a naturalist and explorer who devoted himself {{to the study of}} Madagascar's natural history and local people. With the help of Alphonse Milne-Edwards, most of the diurnal lemurs were illustrated at this time. However, lemur taxonomic nomenclature took its modern form in the 1920s and 1930s, being standardized by Ernst Schwarz in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary, {{along with}} the other Jutland wrecks, has been {{declared}} a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 to discourage further damage to the resting place of 1,266 officers and men. Surveys of this site conducted by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney in 2001–03 have shown the wreck is in three sections, with the two forward sections being heavily damaged and in pieces. Her aft end is upside down and relatively complete except for her propellers, which have been salvaged. Examination of the damage to the ship has suggested that the initial explosion was not in the magazine of 'A' or 'B' forward main turrets, but instead in the magazine of the forward 4-inch battery. <b>An</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> the quantity of cordite in the main magazine would have been sufficient to also ignite 'Q' magazine, destroying much more of the ship. The explosion in the smaller magazine would have been sufficient to break the ship in two, the blast then spreading to the forward magazine and ripping apart the forward section.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Navy {{conducted}} two inquiries {{into the}} reasons for the ship's quick demise. The first, held soon after the ship's loss, concluded that Hoods aft magazine had exploded after one of Bismarcks shells penetrated the ship's armour. A second inquiry was held after complaints that the first board had failed to consider alternative explanations, such as <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> the ship's torpedoes. It was more thorough than the first board and concurred with the first board's conclusion. Despite the official explanation, some historians continued to believe that the torpedoes caused the ship's loss, while others proposed an accidental explosion inside one of the ship's gun turrets that reached down into the magazine. Other historians have concentrated on the cause of the magazine explosion. The discovery of the ship's wreck in 2001 confirmed the conclusion of both boards, although the exact reason the magazines detonated is likely to remain unknown since that area of the ship was destroyed in the explosion.|$|E
5|$|The video shifts {{again to}} Björk {{buried in the}} sand under the rain of ashes. The two pieces of rock appear again, this time each one with a Björk-shaped strata. The strata also sing parts of the song, and two arms come out from the {{floating}} rocks and their hands barely brush against each other. The rocks unite once again as the chorus begins for the second time. During {{this part of the}} video, images of Björk singing in a smoky setting alternate with more rocks uniting to the main two, while their Björk-shaped strata secrete a substance similar to lava from their mouth. All the rocks are now united, forming a big volcano, whose crater is shaped like two opposite Björk-shaped rocks. The volcano finally erupts in <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> magma, while a thunderstorm occurs in the background. The video ends as the volcano fades out and all that remains visible is ash and smoke.|$|E
5|$|With the {{conversion}} of much of England in the 6th and 7th centuries, there was <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> local church building. English monasteries formed the main basis for the church, however, and were often sponsored by local rulers, taking various forms, including mixed communities headed by abbesses, bishop-led communities of monks, and others formed around married priests and their families. Cathedrals were constructed, staffed either with secular canons in the European tradition or, uniquely to England, chapters of monks. These institutions were badly affected in the 9th century by Viking raids and predatory annexations by the nobility. By {{the start of the}} 10th century, monastic lands, financial resources and the quality of monasteries' religious work had been much diminished. Reforms followed under the kings of Wessex who promoted the Benedictine rule then popular on the Continent. A reformed network of around 40 monastic institutions across the south and east of England, under the protection of the king, helped re-establish royal control over the reconquered Danelaw.|$|E

5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react vigorously or explosively with cold water, {{producing}} an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas. This reaction becomes more vigorous {{going down the}} group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces <b>an</b> <b>explosion,</b> <b>of</b> which there are two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds {{in the water and}} producing hydrogen gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by {{the first part of the}} reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.|$|E
5|$|Sparked by low-mintage {{issues which}} {{appreciated}} in value, {{the market for}} United States commemorative coins spiked in 1936. Until 1954, the entire mintage of such issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market, and in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits {{to be made by}} purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the coin collecting hobby, where they sought to purchase the new issues. Among the pieces which had recently been struck and had appreciated in value was the 1935 Old Spanish Trail half dollar. This piece had been issued at the behest of L. W. Hoffecker, a Texas entrepreneur and coin dealer, who put aside a fifth of the 10,000 mintage for himself and sold them well into the 1940s, by which time he had {{served as president of the}} American Numismatic Association (ANA). Congress authorized <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> commemorative coins in 1936; no fewer than fifteen were issued for the first time. At the request of the groups authorized to purchase them, several coins minted in prior years were produced again, dated 1936, senior among them the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar, first struck in 1926.|$|E
