40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of an innovative methodology for the direct measurement of the main kinematic variables in multi-body hydraulic actuation systems. The analysis investigates how the motion capture technique has been applied to the experimental determination of position, velocity and acceleration of hydraulically controlled actuation systems for off-highway machineries. A number of earth-moving machines has been taken into account, in particular a mini-excavator articulated harm has been equipped with both a standard mechanical system for position and acceleration measurement (including different accelerometers, linear and <b>angular</b> <b>transducers),</b> and a set of IR markers for motion capture application. First, the hydraulically controlled boom-arm-bucket system has been operated using a control routine reproducing a reference operating condition, in order to define the accuracy of the motion capture system in detecting the kinematic quantities’ variations. At the same time, the hydraulic variables have been also acquired to monitor the behavior during the machine working routine. Thus, the results obtained by the different experimental techniques have been compared, in order to state the reliability of the motion capture technique to predict the fast dynamics of pressure variations through the accurate measurement of mechanical devices’ oscillation. Finally, the paper reports the main results obtained using the data from the motion capture characterization of the dynamic performance of the mini-excavator, with particular attention devoted to the dynamic analysis through lumped and distributed parameter numerical co-simulation...|$|R

40|$|Deepwater rice (Oryza sativa L.) {{responds}} to partial submergence by rapid elongation of the internodes. The elongation of intact plants was measured during 7 days of submergence using <b>angular</b> <b>transducers.</b> Growth rates began to increase within 3 to 4 h upon submergence and peak-ed after 3 days; they were {{higher in the}} light than in the dark. The composition of the gas phase in the internodal air spaces was analyzed at different times after partial submergence. In the light, the O 2 concentrations in internal gas compartments of intact plants dropped initially, but recovered largely within 90 min. During longer periods of submergence, the internal O 2 concen-tration followed a diurnal pattern with O 2 levels being lower during the night than during the day. An O 2 gradient was found from the apical parts of the plant near the water surface to the basal parts of the shoot. Concentrations of CO 2 changed with a pattern inverse to that of the O 2 concentrations. The level of ethylene in the internodal lacunae increased upon submergence and reached 1 ^/l-liter" 1 after 72 h. It was higher {{at the end of the}} dark period than during the day.

40|$|We {{report on}} three {{different}} methods of gait event detection (toe-off and heel strike) using miniature linear accelerometers and <b>angular</b> velocity <b>transducers</b> {{in comparison to}} using standard pressure-sensitive foot switches. Detection was performed with normal and spinal-cord injured subjects. The detection of end contact (EC), normally toe-off, and initial contact (IC) normally, heel strike was based on either foot linear accelerations or foot sagittal angular velocity or shank sagittal angular velocity. The results showed that all three methods were as accurate as foot switches in estimating times of IC and EC for normal gait patterns. In spinal-cord injured subjects, shank angular velocity was significantly less accurate (p < 0. 02). We conclude that detection based on foot linear accelerations or foot angular velocity can correctly identify the timing of IC and EC events in both normal and spinal-cord injured subjects...|$|R

A phase locked loop, using pairs of the electrodes, causes the cylinder to vibrate {{in one of its}} two fundamental, degenerate modes. In the presence of rotation, some of the vibration is coupled into the outer mode. This can be detected, or suppressed with a closed-up technique and provides a measure of rotation rate.

40|$|An <b>angular</b> position-sensing <b>transducer</b> {{was used}} to make {{continuous}} measurements of acid-induced elongation of Avena sativa coleoptile segments. Elongation rates at pH 4. 5 (5 mm succinate buffer) were about 5 -fold greater than those at pH 6. 0. Buffered 0. 1 mm abscisic acid produced a partial decrease of the growth rate. Pretreatments with abscisic acid buffered at pH 6. 0 usually caused a further reduction of the elongation response when the coleoptile segments were subsequently placed in buffer at pH 4. 5 containing abscisic acid. Abscisic acid did not completely prevent the pH effect {{in any of these}} experiments, and the brief latent period of the pH response was not affected by abscisic acid treatments. At pH 4. 5, where the inhibitory effect of ABA was maximum, low pH-induced elongation was also inhibited by KCN and HgCl 2. These results suggest that pH-(4. 5) induced elongation in this system may be dependent on some metabolic processes and that abscisic acid-induced inhibition of this elongation may involve an interaction with these processes...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop a}} reliable, {{objective}} and sensitive measure of axial trunk rotations in PD, {{which can be}} applied in an ambulatory setting. METHODS: To quantify turning motion, two <b>angular</b> velocity <b>transducers</b> attached to the lower back measured angular velocity of the trunk in the yaw plane (i. e., around the longitudinal axis) and the roll plane (i. e., medio-lateral movements) in freely moving subjects who were instructed to walk and make various types of turning movements. RESULTS: Turn duration was longer in PD patients compared to controls. Peak yaw and peak roll angular velocities were lower in PD patients compared to controls during all turning tasks. CONCLUSIONS: This new approach to measure trunk sway during a simple turning task might serve as an instrument to objectively quantify turning while walking in PD. SIGNIFICANCE: It proves difficult to objectively assess turning performance based upon history taking or clinical examination alone. Objective and easy measurement of axial turning in PD might be used for clinical evaluation, but also in a domestic setting as outcome measure in intervention studies.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patients with {{autosomal}} recessive myotonia congenita display myotonia and transient paresis that diminish with repetitive muscle contractions (warm-up phenomenon). A new approach {{is presented to}} quantify this warm-up phenomenon under clinically relevant gait and balance tasks. METHODS: Ten patients with DNA proven {{autosomal recessive}} myotonia congenita and 14 age-matched controls participated. Subjects performed six everyday gait and balance tasks. Balance control during these tasks was monitored using two <b>angular</b> velocity <b>transducers</b> that measured trunk movements in anterior-posterior (pitch) and medio-lateral (roll) directions {{at the level of}} the lumbar vertebral column. Tasks were performed under two conditions in randomised order: after a 10 -minute seated rest period ("rested") and after having consecutively repeated the task five times ("warm-up"). Controls were also tested twice. RESULTS: "Rested" patients showed the greatest abnormalities (increased sway in pitch and roll) for tandem walking and walking stairs. Balance impairment was also evident for all other tasks. After "warm-up," balance was markedly improved in patients, as reflected by decreased trunk sway (especially during tandem walking) and reduced task duration for all tasks. These results were not only evident at the group level but also clearly present in individual patients. CONCLUSION: The results show that trunk sway analysis detects postural instability in myotonia congenita patients during everyday gait and balance tasks. Moreover, this technique provides a useful tool to quantify the warm-up phenomenon, suggesting a potential use as clinical endpoint in future clinical trials...|$|R

It {{was found that the}} rate of growth and circumnutation reached a high level in the dark stage; in the light stage, however, only the growth rate reached the same high level, whereas the circumnutations were weak. These results showed that in the light stage the stem circumnutation was downregulated more strongly than the growth. Short-term stem responses to darkening and illumination were a further display of the relation between growth and circumnutations. Switching off the light caused an increase in the growth and circumnutation rate. In some cases it was accompanied by changes in the rotation direction. On the other hand, switching the light on caused an immediate transient (several-minute long) decrease in the growth rate resulting in stem contraction, and this was accompanied by an almost complete pause of circumnutation. Additionally, under light, there occurred a subsequent decrease in the magnitude, disturbance of circumnutation trajectory and, in some cases, changes in the direction of rotation. The observed stem contraction and disturbance of circumnutation imply the occurrence of turgor changes in sunflower stem, which may be caused by a non-wounding, darkening or illumination stimulus. Our experiments indicate that the disturbances of the growth rate are accompanied by changes in circumnutation parameters but we have also seen that there is no simple quantitative relation between growth rate and circumnutation rate...|$|R

The involvement of gibberellin in this process was tested by screening a number of gibberellin synthesis and gibberellin response mutants of Pisum sativum L. for the kinetic response of stem growth inhibition by red light. Gibberellin deficient dwarfs, produced by mutant alleles at the Le, Na, and Ls loci, and gibberellin response mutants produced by mutant alleles at the La and Cry 2, Lka, and Lkb loci were tested. Extension growth of expanding third internodes of dark-grown seedlings was recorded with high resolution using <b>angular</b> position <b>transducers.</b> Seedlings were treated with red light at a fluence rate of 4 micromoles per square meter per second either continuously or for 75 seconds, and the response was measured over 9 hours. With certain small exceptions, the response to the red light treatments was similar in all the mutants and wild types examined. The lag time for the response was approximately 1 hour and a minimum in growth rate was reached by 3 to 4 hours after the onset of the light treatment. Growth rate depression at this point was about 80 %. Seedlings treated with 75 seconds red light recovered growth to a certain extent. Red/far-red treatments indicated that the response was mediated largely by phytochrome. The similar responses to red light among these wild-type and mutant genotypes suggest that the short-term (i. e. 9 hour) response to red light is not mediated by either {{a reduction in}} the level of gibberellin or {{a reduction in the}} level or affinity of a gibberellin receptor...|$|R

The measuring instruments deflect upon the application of loads. These deflections must be cancelled to minimize loading interactions. The older calibration stands, integrated with AC induction motors, or DC motors, have provisions for manually releveling the loading point after each load. A newer stand, with integrated DC stepper motors, relevels automatically under software control. It was proposed to extend automation to the old stands. An algorithm to control the unwieldy induction motors to relevel a calibration stand, to within two arcseconds of horizontal direction automatically, was developed. The system developed uses coasting prediction and load adaptation in a general type robust stability control configuration with noncoincidental feedback.

40|$|In photoacoustic imaging, upon short {{laser pulse}} irradiation, {{absorbers}} generate N-shaped pulses {{which can be}} detected by ultrasound transducers. Radio frequency signals from different spatial locations are then reconstructed {{taking into account the}} ultrasound <b>transducer</b> <b>angular</b> response. Usually, the directivity is part of the "a priori" characterization of the transducer and it is assumed to be constant in the reconstruction algorithm. This approach is valid in both transmission and reflection ultrasound imaging, where any echo resembles the transducer frequency response. Center frequency and bandwidth of any echo are almost the same, and the ultrasound transducer collect signals with the same "fixed" acceptance angle. In photoacoustics, instead, absorbers generate echoes whose time duration is proportional to the absorber size. Large absorbers generate low frequency echoes, whereas small absorber echoes are centered at higher frequencies. Thus for different absorber sizes, different pulse frequencies are obtained and different directivities need to be applied. For this purpose once a radio-frequency signal is aquired, it is pre-processed with a sliding window: every segment is Fourier transformed to extract the central frequency. Then, a proper directivity can be estimated for each segment. Finally signals can be reconstructed via a backprojection algorithm, according to the system's geometry. Echoes are backprojected over spheres with the angular extension being adapted to the frequency content of the photoacoustic sources. Simulation and experimental validation of this approach are discussed showing promising results in terms of image contrast and resolution...|$|R
40|$|Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) {{techniques}} {{have achieved a}} great development during the last decades as a valuable tool for material characterization, manufacturing control and structural integrity tests. Among these tools, the guided wave technology has been rapidly extended because it reduces inspection time and costs compared to the ordinary point by point testing in large structures, as well as because {{of the possibility of}} inspecting under insulation and coating conditions. This fast development has motivated the creation of several inspection and material characterization systems including different technologies which can be combined with this technique. Different measurements systems based on laser {{techniques have}} been presented in order to inspect pipes, plates and diverse structures. Many of them are experimental systems of high cost and complexity which combine the employment of a laser for generation of waves in the structure and an interferometer for detection. Some of them employ air-coupled ultrasound generation transducers, with high losses in air and which demand high energy for exciting waves in materials of high stiffness. The combined employment of a commercial vibrometer system for Lamb wave sensing in plates has been successfully shown in the literature. In this paper we present a measurement system based on the combined employment of a piezoelectric wedge transducer and a laser vibrometer to sense guided acoustic waves in carbon steel pipes. The measurement system here presented is mainly compounded of an <b>angular</b> wedge <b>transducer,</b> employed to generate the guided wave and a commercial laser vibrometer used in the detection process. The wedge transducer is excited by means of a signal function generator whose output signal has been amplified with a power signal amplifier. A high precision positioning system is employed to place the laser beam at different points through the pipe surface. The signal detected by the laser vibrometer system is amplified with a signal amplifier and then it is displayed in a digital storage oscilloscope. This set-up offers the possibility of analyzing in a simpler way the wave propagation and the material evaluation in pipes of certain wall thickness. The material characterization considering distinct wave propagation modes can be easily achieved, changing the different incident angles of the wedge piezoelectric probe and their combined employment with several driving signals. Moreover, this experimental sensing system offers other possibilities of inspecting and analyzing the wave propagation in some features (bends, flange joints, welds, [...] .) of the pipe surface which cause very large reflections and mode conversions and which in practice limits the inspection range when are inspected with conventional receiving transducer arrangements.

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{this thesis is about}} the {{balancing}} of large flexible rotors which exhibit mixed modal characteristics. The objective of the research was to develop a balancing procedure to determine correction masses without trial runs. This required the determination of(a) the modal vibration vectors for each resonance, (b) the modal damping ratios,(c) the mode shapes and(d) the equivalent mass of the rotor for each mode. It was made clear from the beginning that trial runs are unavoidable either, when the mode shapes cannot be determined using an analytical or numerical method, or when there is dual vibration at normal operating speed, produced by the influence of higher unbalanced modes, is too high to allow continuous operation of the machine. Therefore, the scope of the project was limited to the possible determination of correction masses without trial runs for the vibration modes included within the normal operating range. Some studies about the minimisation or complete elimination of trial runs have been published by several authors, but a literature search revealed no reports of systematic application of these procedures to field balancing of large turbo generators. This suggested that some practical difficulties had still to be overcome, opening the possibility for further research on this area. Analysis of the rotor response demonstrated the necessity of considering the angular position of the transducers when registering the rotor vibration. It was shown that measuring in a direction other than those of the principal axes of stiffness introduces errors when determining the magnitude and phase of the correction masses. That is to say, failing to consider the effects of the <b>transducer</b> <b>angular</b> position eliminates the possibility of balancing the rotor without trial runs. This {{is the first time that}} this problem has been recognised. The procedure developed was verified using an experimental rotor rig. The successful application of the procedure to the balancing of this rotor demonstrates that balancing withouttrialrunsisnotonlyatheoreticalbutalsoapracticalpossibility. The dynamic characteristics of the rotor rig, however, were some what limited and did not cover all the possibilities considered during the project. Therefore, a more complete numerical example was also successfully solved using the computer model of a rotor with characteristics similar to those of a real turbine, and whose unbalanced distribution was not initially known by this author...|$|R
