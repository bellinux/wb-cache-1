Lishman scored his second of the match in the 80th minute, which sealed a seventh Charity Shield honour for Arsenal.|$|E

So much so, in fact, that in the 2011 off-season, the team parted ways with their long-time starting defensive tackle Kelly Gregg. Cody spent the entire 2011 season as a full-time starter, registering 34 tackles and helping lead the Ravens defense to be ranked 2nd in the league <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>run,</b> ranked 3rd overall. In 2011, Cody eventually started all 16 games as the 3-4 type defensive tackle and finished the year with 39 tackles and 1 pass defended.|$|E
5|$|A {{key to this}} matchup was for Ball State {{to force}} Arkansas State quarterback Adam Kennedy to be one-dimensional, {{limiting}} his ability to run the football, and thus forcing him to pass, attacking the Cardinals' defensive strong point, their secondary. For Arkansas State, establishing a rushing attack early and utilizing it often was paramount, as Ball State did not defend <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>run</b> particularly well during the regular season, however at the same time, Arkansas State needed to limit turnovers as they had all season (13 lost all season – seventh nationally); creating them was a strength for Ball State (30 created all season (including 10 in previous 4 games) – seventh nationally).|$|E

5|$|In the teams' {{first meeting}} since 2010, Penn State visited TCF Bank Stadium {{to face a}} Minnesota team looking for their fourth {{consecutive}} Big Ten victory, and their eighth win of the season, {{which would have been}} their first time since the 2003 season. There was consensus among both Penn State's and Minnesota's SB Nation sites, as well as independent picks, that Minnesota would win a relatively close game. Minnesota's offense was one of the better rushing teams in the conference (20th in the nation), but Penn State's defense was also pretty good <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>run,</b> making it a good matchup. Freshman quarterback Christian Hackenberg in tandem with a running game that, in theory, was led by Bill Belton and supplemented by Zach Zwinak, and receivers Allen Robinson had potential to score a lot of points. Keys to the game included avoiding turnovers and running the football. Minnesota head coach Jerry Kill, recovering from seizures stemming from epilepsy, coached from the press box.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland offense faced first-year {{defensive}} coordinator Nigel Burton's Nevada defense. It ranked {{third in the}} nation <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>run,</b> allowing 74.5rushing yards per game, but was last (120th) {{in the nation in}} passing defense, allowing an average of 321.1passing yards per game. Nevada was ranked eighth in the number of quarterback sacks with 35. Kevin Basped, ranked tenth in the nation in sacks, and Dontay Moch, ranked fifteenth, accumulated more than nine each. Maryland quarterback Turner was sacked 11times in the Terrapins' last two games against Florida State and Boston College. Nevada was also ranked sixth nationally in tackles for loss, with an average of 8.0per game.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{replaced}} midfielder Jiří Jarošík with striker Eiður Guðjohnsen at {{the start}} of the second half, and started the second half in the same manner that they finished the first, with Liverpool withholding the pressure on their penalty area. Cole passed the ball over the Liverpool defence to Drogba in the 54th minute, but defender Jamie Carragher was able to get back and clear the ball. The ball was played back into the penalty area and met by Guðjohnsen, whose header was saved by Dudek, the ball fell to Gallas and Dudek again saved the subsequent shot. Midfielder Antonio Núñez replaced Harry Kewell in the 56th minute. <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>run</b> of play, Liverpool had an attack in the 64th minute. A counter-attack results in a Dietmar Hamann shot, but it was saved by Čech. Liverpool made another substitution following the attack as Igor Bišćan replaced an injured Djimi Traoré. Chelsea continued to push forward and were close to a goal in the 71st minute, but Riise cleared a Gallas after the ball was played to him by Makélélé. Both teams made substitutions in the following minutes. Striker Milan Baroš replaced Morientes for Liverpool while Chelsea substituted Gallas for striker Mateja Kežman.|$|E

5|$|Following their {{championship}} win, Palace {{started their}} second {{season as a}} club in the Southern League First Division, placing 19th {{at the end of}} the season but enjoying better form in the FA Cup. Beating Rotherham County in a qualifying tie, Palace were then drawn away to Newcastle United in the First Round proper. Newcastle had played in the previous two FA Cup Finals, were league champions in 1905 and were on their way to another championship. In what still stands as one of the club's greatest ever wins, Crystal Palace scored through Horace Astley <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>run</b> of play and then held off Newcastle to come away with a shock 1–0 win. The second and third rounds saw Palace dispose of Fulham and Brentford respectively, the latter after a replay, and the quarter-finals saw Palace drawn at home to First Division club Everton, currently flying high in second place. In front of a record crowd of 35,000, Palace took the lead, but their opponents equalised taking the tie to a replay, where Everton proved too strong, running out 4–0 winners.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee's {{defense was}} prized for its success against opponents' passing game. In 2009, the Volunteers were 10th nationally against the pass, {{permitting}} {{an average of}} 165.92 yards per game. <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>run,</b> they were 58th. When both facets were combined, the defense was 16th, permitting an average of 308.83 yards per game. Much {{of the reason for}} Tennessee's success against the pass was star safety Eric Berry, only the second player in Tennessee history to be named a unanimous All-American twice. He won the Jim Thorpe Award, given each year to the best defensive back in the nation. Joining Berry in the defensive secondary was Janzen Jackson, who returned to the field following three missed games caused by his alleged involvement in an armed robbery. Countering Jackson's return, Tennessee lost defensive back Brent Vinson, who was dismissed from the team for reasons unrevealed at the time. Two months after the Chick-fil-A Bowl, Vinson was charged with tampering with evidence related to a murder investigation. Tennessee defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin, interviewed 10 days before the game, said Virginia Tech's offensive strength presented problems for Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|The Vikings' {{defense was}} the league's best <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>run</b> in 2007, {{allowing}} only 74.1 rushing yards per game. However, the Vikings pass defense surrendered 4,225 passing yards, {{the most in}} the NFL in 2007.|$|E

Both {{defenses}} were excelling: Missouri, ranked fifth nationally <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>run</b> in allowing 43.8yards per game and had limited its opponents to 1.59yards per carry; Colorado was ranked 16th, as opponents had averaged 75.3yards per game and just 2.26yards per attempt.|$|E

25|$|Atwater {{was drafted}} {{out of the}} University of Arkansas by the Broncos with the 20th pick {{in the first round}} of the 1989 NFL Draft.
