50|$|Traditionally, {{goods are}} moved around a {{distribution}} centre using a conveyor system or by human operated machines (such as forklifts). In Kiva’s approach, items are stored on portable storage units. When an order is {{entered into the}} Kiva database system, the software locates the closest <b>automated</b> <b>guided</b> <b>vehicle</b> (bot) to the item and directs it to retrieve it. The mobile robots navigate around the warehouse by following a series of computerized barcode stickers on the floor. Each drive unit has a sensor that prevents it from colliding with others. When the drive unit reaches the target location, it slides underneath the pod and lifts it off the ground through a corkscrew action. The robot then carries the pod to the specified human operator to pick the items.|$|E

Results showed that the approach performs significantly better than the dispatching rules and proved that it is really effective for AGVsS...|$|R

The ride vehicles utilized a [...] "traveling theatre"-style <b>automated</b> <b>guided</b> <b>vehicle</b> ride system similar to the former Universe of Energy attraction at Epcot. However, here the ride vehicles were much smaller in size, were grouped together in pairs of two, and featured an open cab in the first row of the front vehicle for a live tour guide to stand, provide narration, and operate the ride vehicle. Earlier and later in the day, only the second pair of ride vehicles (#2B) were used as the first pair of ride vehicles (#1A) were only used during the busier times of day.|$|E

40|$|<b>Automated</b> <b>guided</b> <b>vehicles</b> (AGVs) are {{increasingly}} becoming the popular mode of container transport in seaport terminals. These unmanned vehicles {{are used to}} transfer containers between ships and storage locations on land. The efficiency of a container terminal {{is directly related to}} the amount of time each vessel spends in the port. Hence to maintain competitive advantage and increase the efficiency of the container terminal it is necessary to determine the appropriate number of AGVs to deploy, and formulate good dispatching strategies for these AGVs. Existing techniques available in the literature use a variety of heuristic methods for dispatching the <b>automated</b> <b>guided</b> <b>vehicles.</b> These methods have been primarily developed to work in a manufacturing context where the network structure is simple and only a small number of such vehicles are required. The situation in seaport terminals however entails a greater network complexity and also a large fleet of 80 or more <b>automated</b> <b>guided</b> <b>vehicles.</b> There is little experimental evidence on how these techniques perform in a container terminal environment. Furthermore, for the handful of papers on AGV dispatching in a terminal environment, to the best of our knowledge, none of the proposed methods have explicitly considered the effects o...|$|R
50|$|Work-in-Process {{movement}} {{is one of}} the first applications where <b>automated</b> <b>guided</b> <b>vehicles</b> were used, and includes the repetitive movement of materials throughout the manufacturing process.

40|$|Today {{state-of-the-art}} {{movement of}} <b>automated</b> <b>guided</b> <b>vehicles</b> is mostly unidirectional which needs more space in curves and decreases the flexibility and mutability of such systems in warehouse or facilities. With this focus a new omnidirectional drive concept for <b>Automated</b> <b>Guided</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (AGV) was {{developed at the}} Fraunhofer IML. The concept of the Voith-Schneider ship drive is {{the control of the}} velocity and the position of an AGV. Mechanical parameters {{have a major impact on}} the directional stability. Because of these reasons a close loop control is a strong condition for precise velocity and position control. The rotional and translational velocity closed-loop control is exemplarily realized by 6 degrees of freedom MEMS IMU. Further focus of research was the optimization of maneuverability and energy consumption...|$|R
