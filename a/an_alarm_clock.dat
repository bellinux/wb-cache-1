5|$|Classes {{began at}} 8:30 that morning. Kehoe had set <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clock</b> in the {{basement}} of the north wing of the school, and remotely detonated the dynamite and pyrotol which he had hidden there at about 8:45a.m.|$|E
5|$|The bombing had {{destroyed}} the north {{wing of the}} school. During the search, rescuers found an additional 500pounds (230kg) of dynamite which had failed to detonate in the south wing. The search was halted to allow the Michigan State Police to disarm the devices, and they found <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clock</b> timed to go off at 8:45a.m. Investigators speculated that the initial explosion may have caused a short circuit in {{the second set of}} bombs, preventing them from detonating. They searched the building and then returned to the recovery work.|$|E

He was to accompany and introduce Mahendra Pratap and {{was responsible for the}} German diplomatic representations to the Emir. To fund the mission, 100,000 pounds sterling in gold was deposited in an account at the Deutsche Bank in Constantinople. The expedition was also provided with gold and other gifts for the Emir, including jewelled watches, gold fountain pens, ornamental rifles, binoculars, cameras, cinema projectors, and <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clock.</b>|$|E

25|$|Today, many humans {{wake up with}} <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clock.</b> (Some people, however, can {{reliably}} wake {{themselves up}} at a specific time with no need for an alarm.) Many sleep quite differently on workdays versus days off, a pattern {{which can lead to}} chronic circadian desynchronization. Many people regularly look at television and other screens before going to bed, a factor which may exacerbate this mass circadian disruption. Scientific studies on sleep have shown that sleep stage at awakening {{is an important factor in}} amplifying sleep inertia.|$|E
500|$|In October 1990, {{after he}} had ceased running the [...] "Wake up!"

500|$|Milo {{begins with}} Expectations, a {{pleasant}} {{place where he}} starts on Wisdom's road. In Expectations, he seeks directions from the Whether Man, who is full of endless talk. As Milo drives on, he daydreams and soon is paying no attention at all, and gets lost in the Doldrums, a colorless place where nothing ever happens. Milo is soon joining the inhabitants, the Lethargarians, in killing time there, a pastime angrily interrupted {{by the arrival of}} Tock, a talking oversize dog with <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clock</b> on each side (a [...] "watchdog"), who tells Milo that only by thinking can he get out of the Doldrums. Head abuzz with unaccustomed thoughts, Milo is soon back on his road, and the watchdog joins him on his journey through Wisdom.|$|E
500|$|Louise was {{determined}} to be seen as an ordinary person and not {{as a member of the}} court. When travelling abroad, she often used the alias [...] "Mrs Campbell". Louise was known for her charity towards servants. On one occasion, the butler approached her and requested permission to dismiss the second footman, who was late getting out of bed. When she advised that the footman be given <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clock,</b> the butler informed her that he already had one. She then went so far as to suggest a bed that would throw him out at a specified time, but she was told this was not feasible. Finally, she suggested that he might be ill, and when checked, he was found to be suffering from tuberculosis. The footman was therefore sent to New Zealand to recover.|$|E

500|$|As a {{link between}} {{the end of the second}} verse, where Lennon sings [...] "I'd love to turn you on", and the start of McCartney's middle-eight, the band {{included}} a 24-bar bridge. At first, the Beatles were not sure how to fill this link section. At the conclusion of the session on 19 January, the transition consisted of a simple repeated piano chord and the voice of assistant Mal Evans counting out the bars. Evans' voice was treated with gradually increasing amounts of echo. The 24-bar bridge ended with the sound of <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clock</b> triggered by Evans. Although the original intent was to edit out the ringing alarm clock when the section was filled in, it complemented McCartney's piece – which begins with the line [...] "Woke up, fell out of bed" [...] – so the decision was made to keep the sound.|$|E
500|$|Cardus's lack of {{deference}} sometimes led to friction, as with Hamilton Harty, chief {{conductor of the}} Hallé Orchestra from 1920. In his reviews of the Hallé concerts until Harty's departure in 1933, Cardus frequently criticised the conductor's choices and interpretations. On one occasion he observed that Harty's rendering of the adagio in Beethoven's Ninth had broken the world record for slowness, and quoted minutes and seconds. Responding to Harty's outraged protests, Cardus threatened to bring <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clock</b> to the next performance, [...] "less for critical purposes than for those of personal convenience". When Harty left, he was not replaced as chief conductor; the Hallé employed distinguished visiting conductors such as Beecham, Malcolm Sargent, Pierre Monteux, Adrian Boult and Ernest Ansermet. Cardus considered {{that a lack of}} central direction was adversely affecting the orchestra, and his biting criticisms of some performances led to temporarily strained relations.|$|E
500|$|The album {{begins with}} a melodic cover of [...] "Strawberry Swing" [...] by English {{alternative}} rock band Coldplay. Connor O'Neill of The Miscellany News writes that the cover begins the album with [...] "so much atmosphere you almost melt into it" [...] and then [...] "spreads you over an apocalyptic swan song". The song ends abruptly with the rude sound of <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clock,</b> followed by the [...] "nightmarish" [...] song [...] "Novacane". It {{has been called a}} love song of sorts, with influence taken from alternative hip hop group The Pharcyde. Lyrically the track explores a narrative in which the singer meets a girl attempting to pay her way through dental school by working in porn. Ocean meets the girl at Coachella, a musical festival which takes place in Indio, California. Ocean serves as the protagonist in the song, in love with a girl [...] "so gone on drugs that Ocean, wanting to be close to her, {{has no choice but to}} get gone on those same drugs". The pair get high using dental local anesthetics. Ocean serves as an unreliable narrator.|$|E

500|$|The video commences with Cyrus, in pajamas, {{turning off}} a nightlight and falling asleep. When she wakes up, Cyrus finds {{herself on her}} bed, in a skate ramp; {{she is wearing a}} white T-shirt, a black vest, red pants and black boots. Meanwhile, skaters are using the ramp, Cyrus stands and {{performs}} the song in a confused manner. She then enters a school bus, occupied by businessmen and businesswomen, which she exits through the back emergency door. Throughout the rest of the video Cyrus is seen exploring a [...] "carnival-like" [...] setting, while dancing. Several random figures make appearances, such as astronauts, scuba divers, middle school teachers, and cowboys. A large star pattern falls and reveals a concert stage where Cyrus performs the song along with a band. In the conclusion of the video, Cyrus is woken up by <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clock</b> and a printer prints stills from what occurred throughout the music video. The music video to [...] "Start All Over" [...] was first seen on the Disney Channel on December 19, 2007. It became digitally available, via iTunes Store, on January 29, 2008. In 2008, the video received a MuchMusic Video nomination for Best International Artist Video, but lost to Rihanna's video for [...] "Don't Stop the Music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Grace {{was very}} curious as a child; {{this was a}} lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided to {{determine}} how <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clock</b> worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized {{what she was doing}} (she was then limited to one clock). For her preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey. Hopper was initially rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (her test scores in Latin were too low), but she was admitted the following year. [...] She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master's degree at Yale University in 1930.|$|E
2500|$|Samberg then exits a {{movie theater}} when the {{discovery}} of a missed cellphone call from the girl he met at the club causes him to prematurely ejaculate. In another scene, Taccone is seen driving a Mercedes-Benz while listening to the radio, when a song begins to play that reminds him of the check-out girl, causing him to [...] "jizz" [...] in his pants yet again. Samberg and Taccone then sing about how easily they [...] "jizz in [...] pants" [...] from stimuli such as <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clock,</b> opening a window, the twist ending of The Sixth Sense, and simply eating a grape. They explain that merely being adjacent to women causes them to ejaculate, which, they lament, necessitates the constant wearing of condoms under their boxer shorts.

2500|$|Wingate {{was known}} for various eccentricities. For instance, he often wore <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clock</b> around his wrist, which would go off at times, and had raw onions and garlic on a string around his neck, which he would {{occasionally}} bite into as a snack (the reason he used to give for this was to ward off mosquitoes). He often went about without clothing. In Palestine, recruits were used to having him {{come out of the}} shower to give them orders, wearing nothing but a shower cap, and continuing to scrub himself with a shower brush. Lord Moran, Winston Churchill's personal physician, wrote in his diaries that [...] " [...] seemed to me hardly sane—in medical jargon a borderline case". Likewise, referring to Churchill's meeting with Wingate in Quebec, Max Hastings wrote that, [...] "Wingate proved a short-lived protegé: closer acquaintance caused Churchill to realise that he was too mad for high command".|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, Ellis {{characterized}} {{his mother}} as a self-absorbed {{woman with a}} bipolar disorder. At times, according to Ellis, she was a [...] "bustling chatterbox who never listened." [...] She would expound on her strong opinions on most subjects, but rarely provided a factual basis for these views. Like his father, Ellis' mother was emotionally distant from her children. Ellis recounted that she was often sleeping when he left for school and usually not home when he returned. Instead of reporting feeling bitter, he took on the responsibility of caring for his siblings. He purchased <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clock</b> with his own money and woke and dressed his younger brother and sister. When the Great Depression struck, all three children sought work to assist the family. Ellis was sickly {{as a child and}} suffered numerous health problems through his youth. At the age of five he was hospitalized with a kidney disease. He was also hospitalized with tonsillitis, which led to a severe streptococcal infection requiring emergency surgery. He reported that he had eight hospitalizations between the ages of five and seven, one of which lasted nearly a year. His parents provided little emotional support for him during these years, rarely visiting or consoling him. Ellis stated that he learned to confront his adversities as he had [...] "developed a growing indifference to that dereliction". Illness was to follow Ellis throughout his life; at age 40 he developed diabetes.|$|E
2500|$|Germans {{tended to}} be shown as being either weak or barbaric, but also stupid, and obsessed with Nazism and Nazi imagery. [...] This {{could be seen in}} comic books such as Captain America No. 1, who cover {{features}} the superhero punching out Hitler, while a number of menacing and feral looking officers shoot at Captain America. [...] This existed in cartoons as well. [...] The Popeye cartoon, Seein' Red, White, 'N' Blue (aired on February 19, 1943), ends with a distinctly American Uncle Sam fist punching a sickly looking Hitler. [...] Perhaps nowhere is this unattractive portrayal of Germans better known than in the somewhat controversial Donald Duck cartoon, Der Fuehrer's Face (aired on January 1, 1943). [...] Best known for portraying Donald Duck as a Nazi living in Germany, the cartoon also features caricatures of Benito Mussolini, Joseph Goebbels, Heinrich Himmler, and Herman Göring performing in an oompa-band marching past swastika clouds, bushes, windmills, fire hydrants, and telephone lines, among other things. [...] Donald Duck, living in a house with a striking resemblance to Hitler, is shown to a swastika fence surrounding it, and swastika wallpaper, <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clock</b> that gives the Nazi salute and with each number replaced by a swastika, a cuckoo clock with the same number pattern, and a Hitler cuckoo, and numerous pictures of Hitler and the other Axis leaders decorating the walls. [...] Donald Duck then is forced to his job at a munitions factory (appropriately decorated with even more swastikas) where he must [...] "work 48 hours a day for the Führer" [...] under heavy guard. [...] While screwing in shells on a conveyor belt, pictures of Hitler occasionally pass him which he must salute, all while a loudspeaker extols the glory of Hitler: [...] "Is this not wonderful? [...] Is not the Führer glorious?" ...|$|E
