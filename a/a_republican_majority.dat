5|$|In response, Gingrich {{stated that}} he had not quit the race for the Republican nomination, and pointed to his {{experience}} running for 5 years to win his seat in Congress, spending 16 years helping to build <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in the house and working for decades to build <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in Georgia. Some commentators noted Gingrich's resilience throughout his career, in particular with regards to his presidential campaign.|$|E
5|$|Flanders's {{voting record}} in the Senate was more {{conservative}} than his senior colleague, George Aiken, and reflected Flanders's business orientation. In his second term, <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> allowed Flanders to obtain seats on the Joint Economic Committee—this committee acted in an investigatory and advisory capacity to both Houses of the Congress—the Finance Committee and the Committee on Armed Services. These assignments reflected his interests as a senator.|$|E
5|$|The Indiana House of Representatives {{consists}} of 100 members elected to two-year terms. The Speaker of the House for the 2015–2016 term is Representative Brian C. Bosma. In 2015, the House of Representatives has <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> of 70 seats, while the Democrats have 30 seats.

5|$|Allie Young, {{chairman}} of the state Democratic Party, called a caucus of the Democratic members of the General Assembly to be held on January 1, 1900. As {{a result of the}} caucus, J. C. S. Blackburn was nominated for a seat in the U. S. Senate, Goebel was nominated as president pro tem of the Kentucky Senate, and South Trimble was nominated as speaker of the House. When the General Assembly convened, each Democratic nominee was elected, the party possessing heavy majorities in both houses. Lieutenant Governor Marshall presented a list of committees to the Senate, but that body voted 19–17 to set aside this list and approve a list provided by Goebel instead. Similarly, in the House, the list of committees presented by Speaker Trimble and approved by that body enumerated forty committees, none of them with <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the electoral}} college, {{the vote was}} more decisive. As expected, Hancock carried the South and border states, but Garfield swept {{all but one of}} the Northern states (the {{exception}} was New Jersey, which he lost by just two thousand votes). Both candidates carried nineteen states, but Garfield’s triumphs in the more populous North translated into a 214–155 electoral college victory. The sectional divide of the vote more deeply enforced the Republicans' retreat from the South after Reconstruction, and demonstrated that they could win without competing there. Weaver's resistance to fusion had no effect on the result; the combined Democratic and Greenback vote would have carried Indiana, but not any other of the states Garfield won, and the result would still have been <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in the electoral college. Hancock was convinced that the Republicans won New York by fraud. Lacking evidence, and mindful of the turmoil caused by the disputed election four years earlier, the Democrats did not pursue the matter.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{took office}} on March 4, 1861. Among his first acts was to {{nominate}} Senator Salmon P. Chase of Ohio to be Secretary of the Treasury. Chase resigned his Senate seat on March 7, and {{after two weeks}} of indecisive balloting, the Ohio Legislature elected Sherman to the vacant seat. He took his seat on March 23, 1861, as the Senate had been called into special session to deal with the secession crisis. The Senate that convened {{at the start of the}} 37th Congress had <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> for the first time, a majority that grew as more Southern members resigned or were expelled. In April, Sherman's brother William visited Washington to rejoin the army, and the brothers went together to the White House to meet Lincoln. Lincoln soon called for 75,000 men to enlist for three months to put down the rebellion, which William Sherman thought too few and too short a duration. William's thoughts on the war greatly influenced his brother, and John Sherman returned home to Ohio to encourage enlistment, briefly serving as an unpaid colonel of Ohio Volunteers.|$|E

25|$|Newt Gingrich, in a {{campaign}} in the 1980s and 1990s to produce <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in the United States House of Representatives, relied heavily on words and phrases that cast Democrats in a negative light.

25|$|DeLay {{maintained}} public {{silence on}} Houston's 2003 METRORail light rail initiative, {{though in the}} past, he had opposed expanding light rail to Houston. Public filings later showed that DeLay had his Americans for <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Majority</b> Political Action Committee (ARMPAC) and his congressional campaign committee sent money to Texans for True Mobility, an organization that advocated against the initiative. The proposal passed by a slim margin. Despite his earlier opposition, following {{the passage of the}} initiative, DeLay helped to obtain funding for the light rail program.|$|E

25|$|The {{ascendancy}} of the Republican Party in Georgia {{and in the}} South in general resulted in Georgia U.S. House of Representatives member Newt Gingrich being elected as Speaker of the House following the election of <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in the House in 1994. Gingrich served as Speaker until 1999, when he resigned {{in the aftermath of}} the loss of House seats held by members of the GOP.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the 2010 elections, each party {{controls}} one house of the Iowa General Assembly: the House has <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority,</b> while the Senate has a Democratic majority. Since the defeat of incumbent Democrat Chet Culver in 2010, Iowa's governor has been Republican Terry Branstad, who served as governor from 1983 to 1999. On December 14, 2015, Branstad became the longest serving governor in US history, serving (at that time) 20 years, 11 months, and 3 days; eclipsing George Clinton (vice president), who served 21 years until 1804.|$|E
25|$|Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, {{during the}} 114th Congress, which had <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in the Senate. In March 2016, Obama {{nominated}} Chief Judge Merrick Garland of the D.C. Circuit to fill Scalia's seat. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, and other Senate Republicans argued that Supreme Court nominations {{should not be}} made during a presidential election year, and that {{the winner of the}} 2016 presidential election should instead appoint Scalia's replacement. Garland's nomination remained before the Senate for longer than any other Supreme Court nomination in history, and the nomination expired {{with the end of the}} 114th Congress. President Donald Trump later nominated Neil Gorsuch to Scalia's former seat on the Supreme Court, and Gorsuch was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{theories}} proposed include FBI incompetence, that Syria or Iraq {{directed the}} attacks, or that similar to some 9/11 conspiracy theories the U.S. government knew {{in advance that}} the attacks would occur. Senator Patrick Leahy who is Senate Judiciary Committee chairman and who had received an anthrax-tainted letter, said the FBI has not produced convincing evidence in the case. The Washington Post called for an independent investigation in the case saying that reporters and scientists were poking holes in the case. Had both attacks on the senators succeeded in killing their targets, the result would have been <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in the Senate, {{in the immediate future}} because of the loss of two Democrats, and in the long term, as the governors of the targets' states would have been likely to name Republican replacements. This suggests that right-wing extremists had an incentive to carry out the attacks.|$|E

25|$|Reagan won 53% of {{the vote}} in {{reliably}} Democratic South Boston. His electoral college victory of 489 electoral votes (90.9% of the electoral vote) was the most lopsided electoral college victory for a first-time President-elect. Although Reagan was to win an even greater Electoral College majority in 1984, the 1980 election nonetheless stands as the last time some currently very strong Democratic counties gave <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> or plurality. Notable examples are Jefferson County in Washington State, Lane County, Oregon, Marin and Santa Cruz Counties in California, McKinley County, New Mexico, Polk County, Iowa and Rock Island County, Illinois. Conversely, this was the last time that the Democrats won Georgia and Maryland until 1992. This election is the last time a Republican won the presidency without winning Georgia. This is the first time Massachusetts voted for the Republican candidate since 1956. 1980 is one of only two occurrences of a pair of consecutive elections seeing the incumbent President defeated, the other one happening in 1892. This is the only time in the 20th century a party was voted out after a single four-year term.|$|E
500|$|Discussing {{the impact}} of the {{government}} shutdown on the Republican Party, Gingrich later commented that, [...] "Everybody in Washington thinks that was a big mistake. They're exactly wrong. There had been no reelected Republican majority since 1928. Part of the reason we got reelected... is our base thought we were serious. And they thought we were serious because when it came to a show-down, we didn't flinch." [...] In a 2011 op-ed in The Washington Post, Gingrich said that the government shutdown led to the balanced-budget deal in 1997 and the first four consecutive balanced budgets since the 1920s, as well as the first re-election of <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> since 1928.|$|E

[...] Bayard dissented, questioning the veracity of the witnesses' testimony and stating that there were few incidents of lawlessness and that the South was generally at peace. [...] The majority disagreed, and their findings were {{the basis for the}} Third Enforcement Act later that year.|$|E
25|$|Until the Affordable Healthcare for America Act, a {{combination}} of factors kept health care {{off the top of the}} agenda.
