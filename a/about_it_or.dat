5|$|Toby {{had been}} {{discussing}} {{the details of}} the Scranton Strangler case with Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) for some time. Having grown weary of the subject, she snaps at him that he should do something <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> stop talking. Toby accordingly goes to the local prison to talk to the person convicted of being the notorious local murderer and tell him he believes he is innocent. Offscreen, the convict begins strangling Toby for his part in the conviction. However, Toby does have his spirits lifted after Nellie gives him a lift from the hospital and commends him for his bravery.|$|E
25|$|Certainly, {{there are}} a number of stories {{sloshing}} around the news now that have raised discussions of Israel and of the posture of American Jews to an acrid level. The purveyor of anthrax may have been a former government scientist, Jewish, with a record of baiting a colleague of Arab origins, and with the intent to blame the anthrax on Muslim terrorists. Rocketing around the web and spilling into the press are many stories about Israeli spies in America at the time of 9/11. On various accounts, they were trailing Mohamed Atta and his associates, knew what was going to happen but did nothing <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> were simply spying on US facilities.|$|E
500|$|Upon his death, Harding {{was deeply}} mourned. He {{was called a}} man of peace in many European newspapers; American journalists praised him lavishly, with some {{describing}} him as having given his life for his country. His associates were stunned by his demise; Daugherty wrote, [...] "I can hardly write <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> allow myself {{to think about it}} yet." [...] Hughes stated, [...] "I cannot realize that our beloved Chief is no longer with us." ...|$|E

Between that and my four children, I don't have the time or the energy for anything else. For example, I do appreciate that lots of people worked long and hard putting together things like the DVD of the Sticky & Sweet Tour that we just released, and I have seen the finished product, but I have got no idea how people are going to find out <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> how it's going to be sold." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] {{includes}} {{references to}} numerology in the lyrics [...] "If man is five/then the Devil is six/and God is seven". Francis later expanded on {{the significance of}} the lyrics in an interview to Alternative Press, saying [...] "It's a reference from what I understand to be Hebrew numerology, and I don't know a lot <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> any of it really. I just remember someone telling me of the supposed fact that in the Hebrew language, especially in the Bible, you can find lots of references to man in the 5th and Satan in the 6th and God in the 7th. [...] I didn't go to the library and figure it out". The song's numerology is alluded to on the single's cover, which features figures of five, six and seven, and also a monkey with a halo.|$|E
500|$|It was in {{this climate}} that Weizsäcker {{addressed}} parliament on 8 May 1985. Here, he articulated the historic responsibility of Germany and Germans for the crimes of Nazism. In contrast {{to the way the}} end of the war was still perceived by a majority of people in Germany at the time, he defined 8 May as a [...] "day of liberation". Weizsäcker pointed out the inseparable link between the Nazi takeover of Germany and the tragedies caused by the Second World War. In a passage of striking boldness, he took issue with one of the most cherished defenses of older Germans. [...] "When the unspeakable truth of the Holocaust became known at {{the end of the war}}," [...] he said, [...] "all too many of us claimed they had not known anything <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> even suspected anything." ...|$|E

500|$|The New York Times {{credited}} {{the series}} for its bold premise {{and noted that}} the show provided some insight into eating disorders while offering [...] "a few flashes of clever dialogue and satire." [...] Ultimately, however, the Times found that [...] "Starved relies too heavily on sight gags and gross-out farce." [...] The Los Angeles Times found the show [...] "vexing" [...] for being [...] "at once assured and shallow, accomplished and unconvincing, well-acted and empty." [...] The review singles out Schaeffer's character Sam as [...] "especially unappealing" [...] and points to Schaeffer's roles as creator, producer, writer and director as [...] "an object lesson in the wisdom {{of a system of}} checks and balances." [...] Perhaps most damningly, in noting Schaeffer's experiences with addiction, the reviewer writes that [...] "just because you’ve had an experience doesn’t mean you have anything interesting to say <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> are able to articulate whatever interesting thing you have to say." ...|$|E
500|$|NASCAR {{officials}} reviewed video {{evidence of}} Smith's pass of Stewart {{on the final}} lap with Smith and Dale Earnhardt, Inc. president Max Siegel in attendance, and declared the manoeuvre illegal; Smith was issued a pass-through penalty which dropped him from second to 18th. Smith argued that he was forced down below the yellow line: [...] "I was always told that the rule is if you get forced down there, then you are {{the winner of the}} race, and on the last lap, anything goes. That’s what I was going with. I had a nose inside of him and I could have piled up the whole field." [...] Ninth-place finisher Johnson said there were rumors that drivers were allowed to go below the yellow line on the last lap of the previous day's Craftsman Truck Series race which were circulated {{on the day of the}} AMP Energy 500: [...] "I didn’t know what to really think <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> understood it, or had seen it. It’s ironic how it played out today.” ...|$|E
500|$|... "Witch Doctor" [...] {{is based}} on a true story where Tinie met a girl at a show who he took with him on the tour bus and showed what it's like to live his life. [...] "It's OK" [...] and [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] are two songs that feature vocals and {{production}} from Labrinth. [...] "It's OK" [...] is a contrast from the [...] "intro and fun, random bouncy things" [...] according to Okogwu. He added [...] "it's very unorthodox in the sense that people wouldn't have heard or even expect us to make a song like this because it's very slow and ballad-y. It's very reminiscent to me of the Fugees or something because it just sounds different and very soulful as well." [...] He wrote the song in Jamaica and wanted it to feel rustic and urban. Tinie wanted to [...] "push the envelope" [...] with what you're used to hearing from him and Labrinth. [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] is a feel-good, radio-friendly song that incorporates hip hop and electronic music, along with rap rock, and is about good vibes and [...] "doing your thing". [...] "I'm a lover, not a fighter. I've just come to do my thing and enjoy myself so don't try and get on to me <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> try and make me feel bad about everything that's going on in my life", said Tinie to SB.TV.|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} The Office website {{included three}} cut scenes from [...] "Golden Ticket". One 72-second clip includes Michael eavesdropping from the men's bathroom on Angela, Oscar, Kelly and Meredith, who discuss how unfair Michael is treating Dwight in making him take the fall over the failed golden ticket promotion. Kelly {{also makes the}} remark, [...] "I hope Dwight gets fired and they get a hot new guy to replace him," [...] to which Oscar replies, [...] "Seriously." [...] In another 52-second scene, Michael asks Dwight {{to go on a}} stroll, but Dwight suggests turning it into a [...] "power stroll", which he prepares Michael for by applying sunscreen to his face. And in a follow-up to the scene where workers discuss that Michael should be fired, a visibly angry and upset Michael confronts the office. When he says [...] "Can any of you imagine this office without me?" [...] everyone gleefully raises their hands, but Michael then asks them if they've thought about what kind of terrible person they could get to replace him; he then pointedly says that they could get someone who knows they don't actually need three accountants (Oscar, Kevin, and Angela look visibly ashamed that Michael knew this going back to Season 2's Halloween episode but has never taken any action <b>about</b> <b>it)</b> <b>or</b> someone who doesn't approve of romantic relationships and would transfer one or both people having one to separate branches (Jim and Pam in turn get this message and look thoughtful), and tells the office that they should mind what they're saying about him [...] "when I'm hiding in the bathroom pretending to be pooping." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2003, Gravel gave {{a speech}} on direct {{democracy}} at a conference hosted by the American Free Press. The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I could tell from the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left. I never saw the agenda for the day or listened to any of the other presentations." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1986, Ablett {{became a}} born-again Christian {{and has been}} said to be {{slightly}} aggrieved at constantly being referred to as [...] "God" [...] by fans, a nickname based on his supreme football abilities. Ablett's faith was often highlighted in several tribunal appearances, in one case confessing and pleading guilty to striking Garry Lyon in a 1989 incident, declaring he [...] "wasn't prepared to lie <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> compromise the truth in [...] relationship with God". Ablett's public acknowledgement of his faith, in particular the influence of God in his life, during his acceptance speech for the Norm Smith Medal in the 1989 Grand Final, was also much publicised.|$|E

When Denver {{ended his}} {{business}} relationship because of Weintraub's focus on other projects, Weintraub threw Denver {{out of his}} office and accused him of Nazism. Denver would later tell Arthur Tobier when the latter transcribed his autobiography, [...] "I'd bend my principles to support something he wanted of me.

2500|$|Broadly speaking, existentialists {{hold that}} there are certain {{fundamental}} questions that every human being must come to terms with if they are to take their subjective existences seriously and with intrinsic value. Questions such as life, death, the meaning of human existence and the place of (or lack of) God in that existence are among them. By and large, the theories of existentialism assert that conscious reality is very complex and without an [...] "objective" [...] or universally known value: the individual must create value by affirming it and living it, not by simply talking <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> philosophising it in the mind.

2500|$|Hema {{found that}} the {{arguments}} of the CBI counsel {{were based on the}} stories appearing in the media rather than on the case diary. Counsel responded that the arguments had been accepted by the earlier courts. Based on the case diary, Hema {{found that the}} CBI investigation was [...] "only a chase for the shadow rather the object in this case. This chase is only a futile exercise. Investigation means to carefully examine the facts of a situation, an event, a crime, etc., to find out the truth <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> how it happened.
