[...] As part of the special programming event, Nickelodeon held [...] "The Friend or Foe-Down", a convergent contest where two teams of children meet a series of challenges before the episode's premiere. Team Krabs and Team Plankton each consisted of three children led by team captains and hosts Alexandra Gizela and Jordan Carlos. Each team was infiltrated by a [...] "foe" [...] who is secretly working for the other team, as they partake in a series of [...] "funny and messy" [...] physical group challenges refereed by Tom Kenny as Patchy the Pirate.|$|E
500|$|Stanton {{wanted the}} Axioms {{interior}} to resemble Shanghai and Dubai. Eggleston studied 1960s NASA paintings {{and the original}} concept art for Tomorrowland for the Axiom, to reflect that era's sense of optimism. Stanton remarked [...] "We are all probably very similar in our backgrounds here [...] in that we all miss the Tomorrowland that was promised us from the heyday of Disneyland," [...] and wanted a [...] "jet pack" [...] feel. Pixar also studied the Disney Cruise Line and visited Las Vegas, which was helpful in understanding artificial lighting. Eggleston based his Axiom designs on the futuristic architecture of Santiago Calatrava. Eggleston divided {{the inside of the}} ship into three sections; the rear's economy class has a basic gray concrete texture with graphics keeping to the red, blue, and white of the BnL logo. The coach class with living/shopping spaces has [...] "S" [...] shapes as people <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> for [...] "what's around the corner". Stanton intended to have many colorful signs, but he realized this would overwhelm the audience and went with Eggleston's original idea of a small number of larger signs. The premier class is a large Zen-like spa with colors limited to turquoise, cream, and tan, and leads on to the captain's warm carpeted and wooded quarters and the sleek dark bridge. In keeping with the artificial Axiom, camera movements were modeled after those of the steadicam.|$|E

[...] Collinet continued, translating from his interview in French with Bopol for the program, [...] "Bopol says, if there were good studios in Zaire I would prefer to work there, because there I have lots of inspiration -- you can see what people are doing. [...] We compose our songs by observing people around us. [...] In Europe it's very difficult; you have a different life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before Slumdog Millionaire was released, Patel {{auditioned for}} the role of Zuko by {{submitting}} a tape to the studio. Shyamalan called Patel personally to inform him that he got the part. Training for the film was intense, as he had to learn Wushu and different martial arts. Patel recalls fighting, punching, and throwing and said the experience was [...] "truly amazing." [...] While he was filming Slumdog in India, he would finish a take and turn one of the channels over to the animated series. Even though it is based on a cartoon, he wanted to bring as much of himself as possible to the character he was portraying. Shaun Toub, who was cast as Iroh, describes his character in the first film as [...] "loose" [...] and [...] "free". He compares Zuko's [...] "obsession" [...] to his childhood memories and how kids <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> for their parents' approval, saying that Zuko just wants his father's. [...] "He isn't necessarily bad, he just {{has a great deal of}} built up anger and forgets to consider others. I think people will understand that he's not bad, he's just angry and hurting because he really wants his father to love him, but his father is too busy with other things." [...] He says that Patel is an [...] "18 year old with all this energy," [...] and that Patel was able to influence him into appreciating the business of filmmaking more. While comparing the animated series to the film, he says the film is much more serious. He attributed this change to the director trying to relate to every age group, rather than just kids.|$|E
2500|$|Blache was {{introduced}} to the idea of painting Leah Chase by his art representative at the time Eugene C. Daymude in the summer of 2009. The 20 small oil paintings that comprised the series detailed the day-to-day activities 92-year-old Chef Leah Chase encounters from early morning prep work to greeting guests in the dining room. [...] Blache was heralded for his depiction of the culinary icon for his accuracy and delicate handling of paint, color, and texture. [...] “Asked whether she thought the rendering was accurate, Chase, 89, said the young artist had gotten it right. [...] “I told him, ‘You could have made me look like Halle Berry or Lena Horne, but you made it look like me,’” she said. [...] The painting Cutting Squash was acquired for its permanent collection by the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in 2011. [...] “We <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> for portraits of nationally prominent figures,” National Portrait Gallery chief curator Brandon Fortune said. [...] “It is a very interesting image of a woman at work, doing a very simple task, cutting squash,” [...] [...] [...] “But in some ways it transcends the everyday and becomes something of national significance.” [...] This series reinforces Blache's commitment to documenting everyday labor and showcasing these intimate processes to the public. [...] Another one of the Smithsonian Institution Museums, National Museum of African History and Culture, came calling for another painting of Chase from the Blache series in 2013 and acquired Leah Red Coat Stirring (Sketch) in 2013, making it the third painting from Blache {{to be included in the}} permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
