25|$|On October 5, 2010, Quebecor {{announced}} that it was withdrawing its mandatory <b>access</b> <b>request</b> and applied for a normal Category 2 status without any special exceptions or carriage conditions. The move was widely considered an easier avenue for Sun News' licence approval (Category 2 licences are routinely granted by the CRTC unless it is for a format considered a protected genre, of which national news channels are not included). The CRTC granted Quebecor a five-year Category 2 licence for Sun News on November 26, 2010; the network's status was changed to a Category C service on September 1, 2011, as part of an overall restructuring of broadcasting regulations during Canada's transition to digital television broadcasting.|$|E
2500|$|Before Quebecor withdrew its {{mandatory}} <b>access</b> <b>request</b> for Sun News (see above), {{the public}} interest group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting issued a briefing to the CRTC recommending that Sun News' application be rejected, believing that Sun's mandatory <b>access</b> <b>request</b> was [...] "highly unfair" [...] to other licence applicants. However, Friends recommended that if Sun News did win licence approval, Quebecor {{should be required to}} commit revenue to Canadian programming (equal to that of CTV News Channel and CBC News Network) as well as adhere to the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Code of Ethics for balanced news coverage and programming. The CRTC's November 26 approval specifically included requirements that Sun News would adhere to the RTNDA Code of Journalistic Ethics and the Journalistic Independence Code {{as a member of the}} Canadian Broadcast Standards Council. Sun News was regarded to be a possible benefactor of a proposal by the CRTC to give licensed broadcast stations more leeway to broadcast false and misleading news (the CRTC dropped the proposal in February 2011).|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} logic for specifying {{policies}} where <b>access</b> <b>requests</b> can have {{effects on the}} authorization state. The logic is semantically defined by a mapping to Transaction Logic. Using this approach, updates to the state are factored out of the resource guard, thus enhancing maintainability and facilitating more expressive policies that take the history of <b>access</b> <b>requests</b> into account.

50|$|Access {{control in}} {{computer}} systems and networks rely on access policies. The access control {{process can be}} divided into the following phases: policy definition phase where access is authorized, and policy enforcement phase where <b>access</b> <b>requests</b> are approved or disapproved. Authorization is the function of the policy definition phase which precedes the policy enforcement phase where <b>access</b> <b>requests</b> are approved or disapproved based on the previously defined authorizations.|$|R

50|$|The {{process of}} {{communicating}} with a network begins with an access attempt, in which one or more users interact with a communications system to enable initiation of user information transfer.

50|$|Viewdata is a Videotex implementation. It {{is a type}} of {{information}} retrieval service in which a subscriber can access a remote database via a common carrier channel, request data and receive requested data on a video display over a separate channel. Samuel Fedida was credited as inventor of the system. Fedida had the idea for Viewdata in 1968. The first prototype became operational in 1974. The <b>access,</b> <b>request</b> and reception are usually via common carrier broadcast channels. This is in contrast with teletext.|$|E
5000|$|Random Access. The {{mobile station}} sends a burst on the RACH. This burst encodes an 8-bit {{transaction}} tag and the BSIC of the serving BTS. A variable number of most-significant bits in the tag encode {{the reason for}} the <b>access</b> <b>request,</b> with the remaining bits chosen randomly. In L3, this tag is presented as the RR Channel Request message (GSM 04.08 9.1.8). The mobile also records the TDMA clock state at the time the RACH burst is transmitted. In cases where the transaction is initiated by the MS, this is first step.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} security, general {{access control}} includes authorization, authentication, access approval, and audit. A more narrow definition of access control would cover only access approval, whereby the system {{makes a decision}} to grant or reject an <b>access</b> <b>request</b> from an already authenticated subject, {{based on what the}} subject is authorized to access. Authentication and access control are often combined into a single operation, so that access is approved based on successful authentication, or based on an anonymous access token. Authentication methods and tokens include passwords, biometric scans, physical keys, electronic keys and devices, hidden paths, social barriers, and monitoring by humans and automated systems.|$|E

50|$|A {{firewall}} is {{a network}} device for controlling network security and access rules.
