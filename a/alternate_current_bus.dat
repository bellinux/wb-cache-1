A bi-directional, direct {{conversion}} switch-mode converter is proposed {{for use in}} distributed household renewable energy systems. The converter is intended as the central interface between the household energy system’s low voltage Direct <b>Current</b> <b>bus</b> and the high voltage <b>Alternating</b> <b>Current</b> <b>bus.</b> The low voltage DC bus is connected to renewable generation and storage devices, while the high voltage AC bus {{is connected to the}} user’s equipment and the mains grid. The converter overcomes the inherent reverse-duty cycle problem associated with bi-directional converters by using a combination step-up / step-down half-bridge converter on the high voltage side of a high frequency transformer. The low voltage side of the transformer is driven by a full bridge inverter that acts as a rectifier during reverse mode. In order to control the flow of power in both directions the converter implements Average Current Mode Control. A method is developed to determine the transfer functions of common switch-mode converters by inspection alone. This method is applied to the proposed converter, and both current and voltage mode control loops are designed with the frequency response method. The control system is implemented using a Digital Signal Processor. A method of simultaneously simulating both the converter hardware and software is developed using VHDL. This method greatly reduced the development effort of the converter. The operation of the proposed converter is verified through this method of simulation. A prototype converter is constructed and successfully tested, thereby proving the viability of the proposed converter topology and control methodology...|$|R
40|$|The free-piston Stirling {{convertor}} end-to-end modeling {{effort at}} the NASA Glenn Research Center {{has produced a}} software-based test bed in which free-piston Stirling convertors can be simulated and evaluated. The simulation model includes all {{the components of the}} convertor: the Stirling cycle engine, heat source, linear alternator, controller, and load. So far, it has been used in evaluating the performance of electronic controller designs. Three different controller design concepts were simulated using the model: 1) Controllers with parasitic direct current loading. 2) Controllers with parasitic <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> loading. 3) Controllers that maintain a reference current. The free-piston Stirling convertor is an electromechanical device that operates at resonance. It is the function of the electronic load controller to ensure that the electrical load seen by the machine is always great enough to keep the amplitude of the piston and alternator oscillation at the rated value. This is done by regulating the load on the output bus. The controller monitors the instantaneous voltage, regulating it by switching loads called parasitic loads onto the bus whenever the bus voltage is too high and removing them whenever the voltage is too low. In the first type of controller, the monitor-ing and switching are done on the direct-current (dc) bus. In the second type, the <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> <b>bus</b> is used. The model allows designers to test a controller concept before investing time in hardware. The simulation code used to develop the model also offers detailed models of digital and analog electronic components so that the resulting designs are realistic enough to translate directly into hardware circuits...|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) is a high-efficiency {{generator}} {{being developed}} for potential use on a Discovery 12 space mission. Lockheed Martin designed and fabricated the ASRG Engineering Unit (EU) {{under contract to}} the Department of Energy. This unit was delivered to NASA Glenn Research Center in 2008 and has been undergoing extended operation testing to generate long-term performance data for an integrated system. It has also been used for tests to characterize generator operation while varying control parameters and system inputs, both when controlled with an <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (AC) <b>bus</b> and with a digital controller. The ASRG EU currently has over 27, 000 hours of operation. This paper summarizes all of the tests that have been conducted on the ASRG EU over the past 3 years and {{provides an overview of}} the test results and what was learned...|$|R

5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct <b>current</b> (DC) or <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. <b>Alternating</b> <b>current</b> is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. <b>Alternating</b> <b>current</b> thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. <b>Alternating</b> <b>current</b> is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|R
