5000|$|Autonomation: In any {{contemporary}} setting, {{every one}} uses either machines or software {{to do any}} work. Yet, this <b>automated</b> <b>work</b> still requires specific human judgments to be done right. As a result, many machines can’t be left alone to work because they’re likely to go wrong if someone doesn’t watch them all the time. Autonomation is the practice of progressively imparting human judgement to a system so that it self-monitors and stops and calls a human when it feels it went wrong, just as a desktop computer will flag a virus alert if it feels under attack. Autonomation is essential to separate people from machines and not have humans doing machine work and vice versa. Automation teaches lean thinking by revealing new ways of designing lighter, smarter machines with less capital expenditure.|$|E
