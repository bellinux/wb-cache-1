5|$|Older Macintoshes {{dating from}} 1983 until 1998 {{utilized}} a basic bootloader; the bootloader was solely a ROM chip varying in sizes up to 4megabytes (MB), which contained both the computer code to boot {{the computer and}} to run the Mac OS operating system. This {{was known as the}} Macintosh Toolbox, or the Old World ROM, and differs greatly from design the modern Macintosh which generally use <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> of large capacity to store the operating system. This bootloader was used in all Macintosh computers until mid-1998.|$|E

While there, he overhears a {{conversation}} between Chi-Ling Cheung (a secret agent of the People's Republic of China) and Byrdoy Tolstov (a professor in applied physics and chemistry). Tolstov reveals {{that they are not}} mining for uranium, but that they are experimenting with a special compound called tri-nepheline. Tolstov's daughter Alexandria is being held hostage at Security Headquarters (HQ), and Cord rescues her with the help of Chi, who is suspected of being a spy. Afterwards, Cord plants a bug on a secure server and removes <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> containing information relating to the VFF. Cord {{goes to the}} Containment Facility to apprehend Nagarov.|$|E

5|$|On December 18, 2006, a video {{which showed}} BackupHDDVD {{being used to}} decrypt and copy the film Full Metal Jacket to <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> was {{uploaded}} to YouTube. Two days after the video was uploaded, the initial version of the utility along with its source code and documentation was uploaded to a file hosting service. A link to the file was then posted by the utility's creator on the forums of Doom9, a website devoted to DVD backup. The utility's documentation, along with the forum post, contained little information as to how necessary keys could be obtained. The author elaborated in another forum post, claiming that keys could be obtained by exploiting the necessity {{for them to be}} held in memory to allow playback in player software.|$|E
5|$|System 6's Apple menu {{cannot be}} used to launch {{application}}s. The current application icon in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar cycles between open applications; {{it is not a}} menu. System 6 supports 24bits of addressable random access memory (RAM), which allowed a maximum of 8megabytes of RAM with no provision for virtual memory. These limitations were fixed in System 7. The version of the HFS used by System 6 also has <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> capacity limit; it supports up to 2gigabytes (GBs) and 65,536 files on a drive. This limitation was not increased until System 7.5 which first increased the limit to 4GB.|$|E

25|$|External HDDs {{remained}} {{popular for}} much longer on the Apple Macintosh. Many Macintosh computers made between 1986 and 1998 featured a SCSI port on the back, making external expansion simple. Older compact Macintosh computers did not have user-accessible hard drive bays (indeed, the Macintosh 128K, Macintosh 512K, and Macintosh Plus did not feature <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> bay at all), so on those models external SCSI disks were the only reasonable option for expanding upon any internal storage.|$|E
50|$|In computing, {{an index}} mark or index track is a {{physical}} impression made on <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> disk <b>drive.</b> Its purpose is to indicate {{the starting point for}} each track on the <b>hard</b> disk <b>drive.</b> Usually, <b>an</b> index mark {{takes the form of a}} hole, gap, or magnetic strip.

25|$|A {{new release}} of Wikipedia content was {{published}} by Directmedia on 6 April 2005. This package consisted of a 2.7 GB DVD and a separate bootable CDROM (running a version of Linux with Firefox). The CDROM did not contain all the data, but was included to accommodate users without DVD-drives. The DVD used Directmedia's Digibib software and article format; everything could be installed to <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> In addition, the DVD contained an HTML tree, as well as Wikipedia articles formatted for use with PDAs (specifically, the Mobipocket and TomeRaider formats).|$|E
25|$|ReadyBoost (codenamed EMD) is a disk caching {{software}} component developed by Microsoft for Windows Vista and included in later {{versions of the}} Windows operating system. ReadyBoost enables NAND memory mass storage devices, including CompactFlash, SD cards, and USB flash drives, {{to be used as}} a write cache between <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> and random access memory in an effort to increase computing performance. ReadyBoost relies on the SuperFetch technology and, like SuperFetch, adjusts its cache based on user activity. Other features, including ReadyDrive, are implemented in a manner similar to ReadyBoost.|$|E
25|$|While {{previous}} system updates have been stored on internal memory, {{this is the}} first update to require a storage device. The update requires at least 128MB free space on either a memory card or <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> Microsoft has stated that many Core or Arcade users will not have sufficient space on their limited memory cards for the new update and thus provided them with a free 512MB memory card or a discounted 20GB hard drive for a limited time. This promotion has since ended and all new arcade units now come with 512MB of internal memory.|$|E
50|$|Historically, Macs {{were not}} {{designed}} to be taken apart. Ever since the original closed-box Macintosh in 1984, Apple has always preferred that upgrades take place outside the case. While PC users would open up their computer to install <b>a</b> second <b>hard</b> <b>drive,</b> Mac users would simply plug <b>an</b> external <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> into their computer; this adds slight cost and the external <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> performs more slowly, but is easier for the average user to perform.|$|R

The 4 and 8 GB Zune devices use flash memory and are smaller in size than the 80 GB version, which uses <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> The 30 GB Zune was not redesigned, although it received a software update that brought its interface {{in line with the}} second generation models. At the same time, the Zune 2.0 software was released for Windows PCs. This version of the software was completely re-written and featured a new user interface.|$|E
25|$|In September 2009, Apple {{discontinued}} {{the original}} 40 GB Apple TV and now continues {{to produce and}} sell the 160 GB Apple TV. On September 1, 2010, Apple released a completely redesigned Apple TV. The new device is 1/4 the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8 GB of flash memory to cache media downloaded. Like the iPad and the iPhone, Apple TV runs on an A4 processor. The memory included in the device is half {{of that in the}} iPhone 4 at 256 MB; the same as the iPad, iPhone 3GS, third and fourth-generation iPod Touch.|$|E

As of February 2017, the highest-capacity desktop HDDs stored 12TB, with plans to release a 14TB one in later 2017. As of 2016, the typical speed of <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> in an average desktop computer is 7200 RPM, whereas low-cost desktop computers may use 5900 RPM or 5400 RPM drives. For {{some time in the}} 2000s and early 2010s some desktop users would also use 10k RPM drives such as Western Digital Raptor but such drives have become much rarer as of 2016 and are not commonly used now, having been replaced by NAND flash-based SSDs.|$|E
