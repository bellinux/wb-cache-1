5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that <b>are</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> genes of the viruses.|$|E

5|$|At {{the base}} of {{classical}} mechanics {{is the notion that}} a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. The preferred inertial motions <b>are</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.|$|E
5|$|Dark Forces is a first-person shooter (FPS). The player {{controls}} Kyle Katarn from a first-person perspective, with a {{focus on}} combat against various creatures and characters from the Star Wars universe, although the game also includes environmental puzzles and hazards. Dark Forces follows a central storyline outlined in mission briefings and cutscenes. Each mission includes specific objectives which <b>are</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> story. The missions take place in a variety of environments across the Star Wars universe, including a Star Destroyer interior, Jabba the Hutt's space yacht, and the planet Coruscant, where the player must infiltrate a computer vault.|$|E
5|$|Dungeons & Dragons {{has been}} the subject of rumors {{regarding}} players having difficulty separating fantasy from reality, even leading to psychotic episodes. The most notable of these was the saga of James Dallas Egbert III, the facts of which were fictionalized in the novel Mazes and Monsters and later made into a TV movie. The game was blamed for some of the actions of Chris Pritchard, who was convicted in 1990 of murdering his stepfather.

Players take on the role of Henry, a fire lookout who is assigned to his own tower in Shoshone National Forest. Through exploration of the surrounding area, Henry uncovers clues about mysterious occurrences in the vicinity that <b>are</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ransacking of his tower while out on a routine patrol and a shadowy figure that occasionally appears watching him from afar.|$|E
5|$|Logarithms {{have many}} {{applications}} {{inside and outside}} mathematics. Some of these occurrences <b>are</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> notion of scale invariance. For example, each chamber of the shell of a nautilus is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor. This {{gives rise to a}} logarithmic spiral. Benford's law on the distribution of leading digits can also be explained by scale invariance. Logarithms are also linked to self-similarity. For example, logarithms appear in the analysis of algorithms that solve a problem by dividing it into two similar smaller problems and patching their solutions. The dimensions of self-similar geometric shapes, that is, shapes whose parts resemble the overall picture are also based on logarithms.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{features}} found in sauropods that basal sauropodomorphs lack <b>are</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> change in body size. The greatest regions affected by this are the hind limbs and pelvis. For example, an elongating of the ilium, size reduction of the lesser trochanter shelf, and semiplantigrade posture are some features that indicate the amount and positioning of leg muscles being modified. Vulcanodon possessed these features, the latter of which is seen earliest in it. However, Vulcanodon does not have reduced distal phalanges, which are seen in Shunosaurus and all more derived sauropods. This means that while the muscle positioning of its legs were changing, they had not yet reduced in the distal region of the limb.|$|E
