5|$|This {{serves to}} {{increase}} {{the diversity of the}} antibody pool and impacts the antibody's antigen-binding <b>affinity.</b> Some point mutations will result in the production of antibodies that have a weaker interaction (low <b>affinity)</b> with their antigen than the original antibody, and some mutations will generate antibodies with a stronger interaction (high <b>affinity).</b> B cells that express high <b>affinity</b> antibodies on their surface will receive a strong survival signal during interactions with other cells, whereas those with low <b>affinity</b> antibodies will not, and will die by apoptosis. Thus, B cells expressing antibodies with a higher <b>affinity</b> for the antigen will outcompete those with weaker affinities for function and survival allowing the average <b>affinity</b> of antibodies to increase over time. The process of generating antibodies with increased binding affinities is called <b>affinity</b> maturation. <b>Affinity</b> maturation occurs in mature B cells after V(D)J recombination, and is dependent on help from helper T cells.|$|E
5|$|Certain non-inhibitory serpins {{also use}} the serpin {{conformational}} change {{as part of their}} function. For example, the native (S) form of thyroxine-binding globulin has high <b>affinity</b> for thyroxine, whereas the cleaved (R) form has low <b>affinity.</b> Similarly, transcortin has higher <b>affinity</b> for cortisol when in its native (S) state, than its cleaved (R) state. Thus, in these serpins, RCL cleavage and the S to R transition has been commandeered to allow for ligand release, rather than protease inhibition.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} self-supervised {{framework}} that learns to group visual entities {{based on their}} rate of co-occurrence in space and time. To model statistical dependencies between the entities, {{we set up a}} simple binary classification problem in which the goal is to predict if two visual primitives occur in the same spatial or temporal context. We apply this framework to three domains: learning patch <b>affinities</b> from spatial adjacency in images, learning frame <b>affinities</b> from temporal adjacency in videos, and learning photo <b>affinities</b> from geospatial proximity in image collections. We demonstrate that in each case the learned <b>affinities</b> uncover meaningful semantic groupings. From patch <b>affinities</b> we generate object proposals that are competitive with state-of-the-art supervised methods. From frame <b>affinities</b> we generate movie scene segmentations that correlate well with DVD chapter structure.

5|$|Psilocybin {{is rapidly}} dephosphorylated {{in the body}} to psilocin, which is a partial agonist for several {{serotonin}} receptors, which are also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. Psilocin has a high <b>affinity</b> for the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors in the human brain, and with a slightly lower <b>affinity</b> for the 5-HT2A receptor. Psilocin binds with low <b>affinity</b> to 5-HT1 receptors, including 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D. Serotonin receptors are located in numerous parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, and {{are involved in a}} wide range of functions, including regulation of mood and motivation. The psychotomimetic (psychosis-mimicking) effects of psilocin can be blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by the 5-HT2A antagonist drug ketanserin. Various lines of evidence have shown that interactions with non-5-HT2 receptors also contribute to the subjective and behavioral effects of the drug. For example, psilocin indirectly increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the basal ganglia, and some psychotomimetic symptoms of psilocin are reduced by haloperidol, a non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist. Taken together, these suggest that there may be an indirect dopaminergic contribution to psilocin's psychotomimetic effects. Unlike LSD, which binds to D2-like dopamine receptors in addition to having strong <b>affinity</b> for several 5-HT receptors, psilocybin and psilocin have no <b>affinity</b> for the dopamine D2 receptors.|$|E
5|$|Stereochemical affinity: {{the genetic}} code {{is a result of}} a high <b>affinity</b> between each amino acid and its codon or anti-codon; the latter option implies that pre-tRNA {{molecules}} matched their corresponding amino acids by this <b>affinity.</b> Later during evolution, this matching was gradually replaced with matching by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.|$|E
5|$|The <b>affinity</b> of an {{antagonist}} for its {{binding site}} (Ki), i.e. {{its ability to}} bind to a receptor, will determine the duration of inhibition of agonist activity. The <b>affinity</b> of an antagonist can be determined experimentally using Schild regression or for competitive antagonists in radioligand binding studies using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. Schild regression {{can be used to}} determine the nature of antagonism as beginning either competitive or non-competitive and Ki determination is independent of the <b>affinity,</b> efficacy or concentration of the agonist used. However, it is important that equilibrium has been reached. The effects of receptor desensitization on reaching equilibrium must also be taken into account. The <b>affinity</b> constant of antagonists exhibiting two or more effects, such as in competitive neuromuscular-blocking agents that also block ion channels as well as antagonising agonist binding, cannot be analyzed using Schild regression. Schild regression involves comparing the change in the dose ratio, the ratio of the EC50 of an agonist alone compared to the EC50 {{in the presence of a}} competitive antagonist as determined on a dose response curve. Altering the amount of antagonist used in the assay can alter the dose ratio. In Schild regression, a plot is made of the log (dose ratio-1) versus the log concentration of antagonist for a range of antagonist concentrations. The <b>affinity</b> or Ki is where the line cuts the x-axis on the regression plot. Whereas, with Schild regression, antagonist concentration is varied in experiments used to derive Ki values from the Cheng-Prusoff equation, agonist concentrations are varied. <b>Affinity</b> for competitive agonists and antagonists is related by the Cheng-Prusoff factor used to calculate the Ki (<b>affinity</b> constant for an antagonist) from the shift in IC50 that occurs during competitive inhibition. The Cheng-Prusoff factor takes into account the effect of altering agonist concentration and agonist <b>affinity</b> for the receptor on inhibition produced by competitive antagonists.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{sodium ion}} <b>affinities</b> of the amino acids Asn, Gln, His and Arg have been {{determined}} by experimental and computational approaches (for Asn, His and Arg). Ne-bound heterodimers with amino acid and peptide ligands (Pep(1), Pep(2)) were produced by electrospray ionization. From the dissociation kinetics of these Pep(1) -Na+-Pep(2) ions to Pep(1) -Na+ and Pep(2) -Na+, determined by collisionally activated dissociation, a ladder of relative <b>affinities</b> was constructed and subsequently converted to absolute <b>affinities</b> by anchoring the relative values to known Na+ <b>affinities.</b> The Na+ <b>affinities</b> of Asn, His and Arg, were calculated at the MP 2 (full) / 6 - 311 +G(2 d, 2 p) //MP 2 / 6 - 31 G(d) level of ab initio theory.
