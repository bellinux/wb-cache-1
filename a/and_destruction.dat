5|$|A tantric {{interpretation}} sees Shiva as {{consciousness and}} Kali as power or energy. Consciousness and energy are dependent upon each other, since Shiva depends on Shakti, or energy, {{in order to}} fulfill his role in creation, preservation, <b>and</b> <b>destruction.</b> In this view, without Shakti, Shiva is a corpse — unable to act.|$|E

5|$|Chhinnamasta is {{a goddess}} of contradictions. She symbolises both aspects of Devi: a life-giver and a life-taker. She is {{considered}} both {{a symbol of}} sexual self-control and an embodiment of sexual energy, depending upon interpretation. She represents death, temporality, <b>and</b> <b>destruction</b> as well as life, immortality, and recreation. The goddess conveys spiritual self-realization and the awakening of the kundalini– spiritual energy. The legends of Chhinnamasta emphasise her self-sacrifice– sometimes coupled with a maternal element– sexual dominance, and self-destructive fury.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{classify}} Little Gidding as a poem of {{fire with}} an emphasis on purgation and the Pentecostal fire. The beginning of the poem discusses time and winter, with attention paid to the arrival of summer. The images of snow, which provoke desires for a spiritual life, transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire, earth, air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four. Following this is a discussion on death <b>and</b> <b>destruction,</b> things unaccomplished, and regret for past events.|$|E
