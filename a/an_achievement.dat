5|$|Gasking {{asserted}} {{that the creation of}} the world is the most marvellous achievement imaginable. The merit of such <b>an</b> <b>achievement</b> is the product of its quality and the creator's disability: the greater the disability of the creator, the more impressive the achievement. Non-existence, Gasking asserts, would be the greatest handicap. Therefore, if the universe is the product of an existent creator, we could conceive of a greater being—one which does not exist. A non-existent creator is greater than one which exists, so God does not exist. Gasking's proposition that the greatest disability would be non-existence is a response to Anselm's assumption that existence is a predicate and perfection. Gasking uses this logic to assume that non-existence must be a disability.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the MTA began {{automating}} the subway by Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC).

CBTC became operational in February 2009.

5|$|Cadets have a rank {{structure}} {{similar to}} the United States Air Force enlisted and officer grades, excluding those of general officers. A cadet starts as a cadet airman basic, and is promoted {{as he or she}} completes each achievement. Unlike the regular armed forces, where it is possible to enter as either directly as a commissioned following completion of some form of officer training (service academy, college ROTC, or OCS/OTS, etc.), or enlist and eventually advance to non-commissioned officer or petty officer status, a CAP cadet must be promoted through every CAP cadet enlisted grade in order to achieve the rank of CAP cadet second lieutenant. To complete <b>an</b> <b>achievement,</b> a cadet must pass a physical fitness test as well as two written tests, one for leadership and one for aerospace education. The only exceptions to this rule are the promotions to cadet airman and cadet staff sergeant, which have no aerospace test. For some achievements, an additional test of drill proficiency is required. In the new promotion system, effective as of 2010, there is a drill test for all CAP cadet enlisted grades.|$|E
5|$|Designed as {{a weapon}} with the longest reach in Soulcalibur, Ivy's sword Valentine {{consists}} of several smaller blades linked together by a chain, able to take either broadsword or chain whip forms. These forms are represented by different stances Ivy can use in the series, altering many of her attacks for each and applying different uses to either form of the weapon, with some, such as Spiral Lust, a component of an existing attack. In addition to these the sword can also have the segments be split apart, in which case they will attack the opponent in different ways before recombining on the sword's chain. Due to her variety, Ivy has been noted as being able to attack from any range, however she has also been described as difficult to properly use unless utilizing a range the opponent is weakest at. However, attacks such as Ivy Brambler allow her greater variety in range, and allow for chaining into other attacks upon a successful strike. Other attacks, such as Summoning Suffering and Calamity Symphony, involve grappling with the opponent to damage them, though utilize complex controller inputs that require them to be utilized in tandem with other moves. With the Xbox Live release of Soulcalibur, due to its complexity the former was utilized for <b>an</b> <b>achievement.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purposes}} of this study aimed to study and compare the undergraduates’ English learning techniques and English learning strategies among four skills; listening, speaking, reading and writing in <b>a</b> high <b>achievement</b> group and <b>a</b> low <b>achievement</b> group in phase one and to study the results of using the English learning techniques in <b>a</b> low <b>achievement</b> group in phase two. The research instruments employed at each phase were the English learning techniques and strategies questionnaire, the semi- structured interview form, the behavioural observation form, the self-reflection form and task evaluation form. The findings revealed that the undergraduates in <b>a</b> high <b>achievement</b> group and <b>a</b> low <b>achievement</b> group used the different English learning techniques but the similar English learning strategies. The high achievement group; however, performed better in English skills than the low achievement group because of the duration of their practices and the concentration for academic purposes. Moreover, the results of using English learning techniques in the low achievement group demonstrated that the students had better English learning behaviours and obtained a very good level from task assessment...|$|R
