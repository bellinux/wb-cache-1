40|$|<b>Area</b> <b>frame</b> <b>sampling</b> for {{agricultural}} statistics is a procedure currently {{used by the}} Statistical Reporting Service of the US Department of Agriculture {{as well as by}} agriculture departments in other countries. A primary advantage of the area frame is that it provides complete coverage of the population. In <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> <b>sampling</b> the total area is divided into segments of land that form the sampling units. These segments are delineated by the use of detailed maps and aerial photography. The reporting units, however, are not the segments but are the farms. Since there will be many cases where farms overlap the boundaries of the segments, there have to be rules for assigning data from the farms to the sample segments. Previously used procedures for making this assignment are the open segment method, where the total farm value is assigned to the segment that contains the farm headquarters, the closed segment method, where the actual value associated with the tracts of land contained within the segment is used, and the weighted segment method, where the total farm value is weighted by the proportion of the farm area that is contained in the segment. In this thesis, a general linear unbiased estimator is formulated that includes all previously used methods as special cases. These methods are compared in terms of variance and cost. The optimal estimator depends on the amount and type of overlap of farms with segment boundaries, so {{it is not possible to}} give an estimator that is always to be preferred. However, comparisons are made under some special assumptions that, while not particularly realistic, do give insight into conditions affecting the methods and show that the multiplicity rule is an important method to consider...|$|E

This technique is used widely in estimation of crop area and yield. This work is carried out utilizing the same method but tested for the tropical forest in Malaysia. The estimates have been conducted using direct expansion from sample survey and regression estimator approaches. The latter result using regression of ground data and satellite data seem more reliable when training pixels are chosen at random subset of the <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>frame.</b> The regression analyses showed all the land cover class had a very high correlation (r 2 = 0. 86 to 0. 89).

In addition to being our national symbol and having threatened status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, bald eagles serve as good indicators of environmental health. To estimate {{the number of}} bald eagles in a specific area, we recommend the implementation ofa dual frame sampling technique widely used in agricultural surveys by the U. S.

40|$|This paper summarises two {{different}} {{activities of the}} MARS project in crop area estimation: the Regional Crop Inventories, that combine high resolution satellite images and ground surveys in a classical statistical scheme based on <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> <b>sampling</b> and ground visits providing the main estimation variable.

They can also improve a posteriori the accuracy of estimations, for example through a regression estimator, or provide ground survey documents when aerial photographs cannot be obtained.

Recent changes on the price policy of some image providers and progress on image processing suggest the convenience to review the cost-efficiency assessment.

40|$|Agriculture {{has been}} {{utilizing}} digital earth resource observation satellite data since {{the launch of}} the first Landsat in 1972. There are three major applications in the U. S. agricultural statistics program. These are area sampling frame construction, crop area estimation, and crop condition assessment. In addition, we are {{in the early stages of}} research on using remote sensing in yield models. The area sampling frame construction process is the largest operational application. Area sampling frames remain as the statistical foundation of many U. S. probability based agricultural surveys, since area frames have complete frame coverage and no duplication of land areas. NASS has been utilizing <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> <b>sampling</b> since 1954 and nationwide since 1965. The land area of the country (state by state in the U.

40|$|Image classifications, {{including}} sub-pixel analysis, {{are often}} used to estimate crop acreage directly. However, this type of assessment often leads to a biased estimation, because commission and omission errors generally do not compensate for each other. Regression estimators combine remote sensing information with more accurate ground data on a field sample, and can result in more accurate and cost-effective assessments of crop acreage. In this pilot study, which aims to produce crop statistics in Guoyang County, the <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> <b>sampling</b> approach is adapted to a strip-like cropping pattern on the North China Plain. Remote sensing information {{is also used to}} perform a stratification in which non-agricultural areas are excluded from the ground survey. In order to compute crop statistics, 202 ground points in the agriculture stratum were surveyed. Image classification was included as an auxiliary variable in the subsequent analysis to obtain a regression estimator.

40|$|Crop yield {{forecasting}} {{models are}} needed to help farmers and decision makers cheaply detect crop condition early enough to assess and mitigate its impacts on grain production. A precise estimate of crop production requires an accurate measure of the total cultivated area and well-established knowledge of crop yield. The first requirement {{is no longer a}} problem as is technically solved through various techniques such as <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> <b>sampling.</b> With respect to the second, great efforts have been made to find an accurate definition of the crop yield with respect to the actual factors that shape its growth through out the season. Agrometeorological models have found a wide range of applications in agricultural research and technology and are playing an increasing role in translating information about climate variability into assessments, predictions and recommendations tailored to the needs of agricultural decision makers. However these models have generally been developed and tested for application at the scale of a homogeneous plot. They are criticized for their inability to address large-scale yield estimates at regional or even national levels in addition to their high cost of application. This is because field conditions during the period of crop establishment at the regional scale may be quite variable and poorly represented by standard parameter values of the crop model...|$|E

40|$|Patches of {{semi-natural}} vegetation, encompassing both {{woody vegetation}} and grassland, located within larger areas of agricultural land, are acknowledged {{to play an}} important role in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service supply. In spite of its relevance, semi-natural vegetation in agricultural land (SENAGRI) has never been mapped at the EU spatial extent. To recover from this information lack, the original contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it delivers the first 1 km resolution continuous map of abundance of SENAGRI features at the EU scale. Second, it provides an EU region-based assessment of the correlation between the SENAGRI map and existing maps of ecosystem service supplies. The proposed mapping system adopts a convergence-of-evidence approach, whose inputs are multi-resolution geospatial information/data sources, like the 25 m resolution satellite Image 2000 /Image 2006 mosaics, to be mapped by the fully automatic Spectral Rule-based preliminary Classifier (SRC), and several ancillary classification maps, like the 1 ha-resolution CORINE Land Cover (CLC) 2006 map and the 25 m resolution European Forest 2006 map. Validation of the SENAGRI output map with the Land Use and land Cover <b>Area</b> <b>frame</b> <b>Sampling</b> (LUCAS) 2006 reference data set reveals that the SENAGRI map accuracy is superior to those of the individual classification maps adopted as input. A region-specific analysis at the EU scale shows that: (i) correlation between SENAGRI abundance and regulating ecosystem services is significant (R 2 = 0. 67) and (ii) almost no correlation is found between SENAGRI abundance and provisioning ecosystem services. Finally, agricultural land in EU regions is parameterized by SENAGRI abundance, provisioning and regulating ecosystem services supply data. These EU region-specific values reveal that, within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), a portfolio of agro-environmental schemes is recommended to ensure agro-ecosystem sustainability, in compliance with the EU Strategy for Biodiversity to 2020 and the targets of the CAP post- 2013.

In some cases, volunteered data collection overlaps with that of mapping agencies, e. g., the citizen-based mapping of features in OpenStreetMap. LUCAS (Land Use Cover <b>Area</b> <b>frame</b> <b>Sample)</b> is one source of authoritative in-situ data that are collected every three years across EU member countries by trained personnel at a considerable cost to taxpayers. This paper presents a mobile application called FotoQuest Austria, which involves citizens in the crowdsourcing of in-situ land cover and land use data, including at locations of LUCAS sample points in Austria. The results from a campaign run during the summer of 2015 suggest that land cover and land use can be crowdsourced using a simple protocol based on LUCAS. This has implications for remote sensing as this data stream represents a new source of potentially valuable information for the training and validation of land cover maps as well as for area estimation purposes. Although the most detailed and challenging classes were more difficult for untrained citizens to recognize, the agreement between the crowdsourced data and the LUCAS data for basic high level land cover and land use classes in homogeneous areas (ca. 80 %) shows clear potential. Recommendations for how to further improve the quality of the crowdsourced data in the context of LUCAS are provided so that this source of data might one day be accurate enough for land cover mapping purposes...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) conducts {{quarterly}} surveys for {{estimation of}} some primary commodities produced on farms and ranches. The commodities often have highly skewed distributions {{with a few}} farms producing very large amounts. NASS uses dual sampling frames comprised of the list frame for efficient stratification and the area frame for estimation of the part (nonoverlap) {{of the population that}} is not included in the list frame. Because the <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> <b>sampling</b> probabilities are relatively small, a few large observations in the nonoverlap sample can greatly influence the usual direct expansion (DE) estimates for population totals. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate modifications of the usual DE estimators which could produce more efficient estimators for the NASS quarterly surveys. An empirical Bayes approach is used as a method for including estimates from previous quarterly surveys to help stabilize the estimate for the current survey. Another approach is to right-censor the very large expanded observations in the nonoverlap sample to produce a censored direct expansion (CDE) estimator. A bias adjustment, formed as the ratio of the DE and CDE sums over the repeated surveys, is applied to the CDE estimator to produce the adjusted censored direct expansion (ACDE) estimator. The empirical Bayes technique is then applied to the ACDE estimates. The empirical Bayes and censored estimates are calculated for total hogs and pigs in the nine quarterly surveys: March 1987 -March 1989 from Indiana, Iowa, and Ohio. A bootstrap method is constructed to estimate and compare the biases, standard errors, and root mean square errors (RMSE's) of the various estimators. Only a slight reduction in RMSE resulted from censoring the very large expanded observations in the nonoverlap sample. Application of the empirical Bayes technique to either the DE or the ACDE estimators reduced the average RMSE by about 10 % {{in each of the three}} states...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. In South Africa, {{there are}} no {{reliable}} statistics regarding animal numbers and distribution. The goal, therefore, {{of this research is}} to provide the framework and procedure for obtaining these statistics efficiently and accurately. Available sampling methods and sampling frames were investigated and it was decided to carry out a sample survey because the Gauteng Province consists {{of a large number of}} holdings (land parcels). In the Gauteng Province, where a complete list of farmers or land owners is not available, it was decided to use an area sampling frame. Once the choice of sample design was made, the survey objectives were defined according to the clients’ needs. The sampling frame was constructed using various land parcel layers. These land parcels were merged, using GIS software, into one continuous layer of land parcels. They were then stratified to reduce the variance of the variable (animals) under study over the entire area, using area of land parcel and land-cover. The sample size was then calculated and the land parcels were selected randomly for survey purposes. The survey was conducted between September and December 1999 and the questionnaires were input into a database for the estimation procedures. The closed estimation procedure was used because it is the only possible option if the data surveyed are referenced to the land parcel (and not to a farm that includes several land parcels). The <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> <b>sampling</b> methodology worked well for cattle, sheep, horses, pigs and dogs/cats and to a lesser extent for goats, donkeys and game. The area frame method did not work well for poultry (because of extremely high values in a few land parcels), ostriches or mules (these are rare in the province). Spatial distributions and density distributions were then interpolated from the animal counts taken in the survey and they give a general idea of the location of animals. The distributions of cattle, sheep, horses, pigs and dogs/cats are reliable. The distributions of the rest are distorted due to extreme counts in a few land parcels but a general idea of concentrations can still be inferred. Considering that no historical data exists and that the overall goal of this research was to get an idea of animal numbers and the distribution of animals in Gauteng province, it can be considered successful, in that decision- makers now have a reliable source of information from which good decisions can be made...|$|E

30|$|As {{discussed}} by Gregoire and Valentine (2008, p. 8), before a sample {{can be drawn}} from a population, it is necessary to have available a ‘sampling frame’, that is, a mechanism that identifies and locates the sampling units within the population. It may be a ‘list sampling frame’ whereby a list of each and every sampling unit has been compiled, or it may be an ‘area sampling frame’ that consists only of a map of the area containing the sampling units. If an <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> only is available, the number of sampling units within the population is unknown and {{it is impossible to know}} where to start or finish selection of those that are to be included in a sample. In many areas of human endeavour, it is common to have to deal with large populations for which no list <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> has been compiled. The items making up such populations could be as varied as households within a city, trees in a forest, pebbles on a beach, objects in a photograph, cells on a microscope slide or any other situation where a large number of items appear on a surface or within a volume.|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} two probability sampling approaches to sampling water resources. In the first approach, a complete enumeration of eligible sample units (e. g. stream segments, water bodies, drainage basins) {{is performed using}} GIS or paper maps to create a list frame. A probability random sample is then selected from this frame. In the second approach, a two-stage sample is selected. In the first stage, area segments are selected using a probability design, such as stratified sampling. Water resources contained in each segment are enumerated and labeled using field visits or aerial photographs. In a second stage, the water resource or related sampling units (e. g. stream segments, water bodies, measurement points) are selected {{in each of the}} segments. Examples of both approaches are presented, and their relative strengths and weaknesses are discussed.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the frame}} of the Land Use/Land Cover <b>Area</b> <b>Frame</b> Survey <b>sampling</b> of topsoil was carried out on around 22, 000 points in 25 EU Member States in 2009 and in {{additional}} 2 Member States in 2012. Besides other basic soil properties soil phosphorus (P) content of the samples were also measured in a single laboratory in both years. Based on the results of the LUCAS topsoil survey we performed an assessment of plant available P status of European croplands. Higher P levels can be observed in regions where higher crop yields can be expected and where high fertilizer P inputs are reported. Plant available phosphorus levels were determined using two selected fertilizer recommendation systems: one from Hungary and one from the United Kingdom. The fertilizer recommendation system of the UK does not recommend additional fertilizer use on croplands with highest P supply, which covers regions mostly in Belgium and the Netherlands. According to a Hungarian advisory system {{there is a need for}} fertilizer P input in all regions of the EU. We established a P fertilizer need map based on integrating results from the two systems. Based on data from 2009 and 2012, P input demand of croplands in the European Union was estimated to 3, 849, 873 [*]tons(P 2 O 5) /year. Meanwhile we found disparities of calculated input need and reported fertilizer statistics both on local (country) scale and EU level. The first ever uniform topsoil P survey of the EU highlights the contradictions between soil P management of different countries of the Union and the inconsistencies between reported P fertilizer consumption and advised P doses. Our analysis shows a status of a baseline period of the years 2009 and 2012, while a repeated LUCAS topsoil survey can be a useful tool to monitor future changes of nutrient levels, including P in soils of the EU...|$|R
50|$|This {{report is}} {{primarily}} based upon {{data from the}} Gallup World Poll, which is an ongoing research project carried out in more than 140 countries that together represent around 95% of the world’s adult population (around 5 billion people).In most countries surveyed, 1,000 questionnaires are completed by {{a representative sample of}} individuals living across the country. The coverage area is the entire country including rural <b>areas.</b> The <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> represents the entire civilian, non-institutionalised, aged 15 and older population of the entire country. In some large countries such as China and Russia samples of at least 2,000 are collected, while in a small number of countries, the poll covers 500 to 1,000 people but still features a representative sample. The survey is not conducted in a limited number of instances including where the safety of interviewing staff is threatened, scarcely populated islands in some countries, and areas that interviewers can reach only by foot, animal or small boat.|$|R
