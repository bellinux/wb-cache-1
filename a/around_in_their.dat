5|$|Arsenal {{defeated}} Chelsea {{at home in}} {{the first}} weekend of October. The team found themselves two goals down after 20 minutes, but a converted Dixon penalty and goals from Wright and Campbell turned the score <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> favour. Arsenal came away from Old Trafford with a point against league leaders Manchester United on 19 October 1991. After a midweek European football match, Arsenal beat Notts County by two goals, a result which moved them fourth in the table.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} the North American Union exists only as a {{proposal}} contained in one of a thousand academic and/or policy papers published each year that advocate all manner of idealistic but ultimately unrealistic approaches to social, economic and political problems. Most of these are passed <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own circles and eventually filed away and forgotten by junior staffers in congressional offices.

25|$|The most {{significant}} sensorimotor problems astronauts will face during a {{stay on the}} Moon and Mars are likely to occur when walking <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> space suits. The suits are big and bulky and change the body's center of gravity. This along with the uneven terrain and limited field of view makes locomotion challenging.|$|E
25|$|In walking, and {{for many}} animals running, the motion of legs {{on either side of}} the body {{alternate}}s, i.e. is out of phase. Other animals, such as a horse when galloping, or an inchworm, alternate between their front and back legs. An alternative to a gait that alternates between legs is hopping or saltation, where all legs move together. As a main means of locomotion, this is usually found in bipeds or semi-bipeds. Among the mammals saltation is commonly used among macropods (kangaroos and their relatives), jerboas, springhares, kangaroo rats, hopping mice, gerbils, and sportive lemurs. Certain tendons in kangaroo hind legs are very elastic, allowing kangaroos to effectively bounce along conserving energy from hop to hop, making hopping a very energy efficient way to move <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> nutrient poor environment. Saltation is also used by many small birds. Frogs and fleas also hop.|$|E
25|$|Taxation in Norway can {{be traced}} back to the petty kingdoms before the {{unification}} of Norway. The kings of the petty kingdoms were not permanent residents of one single royal estate, but were moving <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> kingdom, staying for a while at royal estates in each part of it. The peasants in the area where the king stayed, were obliged to provide payment in kind to the king and his entourage. This obligation is called veitsle. This performance of the peasants to their king, has most likely been an important and necessary source of income for the petty kingdoms and made it possible for the king and his entourage to live off the profits from the farming society. Veitsle was continued when the unified Norwegian kingdom arose. The early national kingdom had in addition other casual tax revenues like finnskatt (and possibly tax revenues from Shetland, Orkney, the Faroes and Hebrides) and trade and travel fees (landaurar).|$|E

The scenes of these giant ships duking it out, with many gnat-like fighters swarming <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> little dances of death, have led reviewers to feel a sense of epicness, comparable to reliving battles in science fiction series like Babylon 5 and Star Wars.

2500|$|Of {{his time}} as an NSA analyst, {{directing}} the work of others, Snowden recalled a moment {{when he and his}} colleagues began to have severe ethical doubts. Snowden said 18 to 22-year-old analysts were suddenly [...] "thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility, where they now have access to all your private records.

They turn <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> chair and they show a co-worker ... and sooner or later this person's whole life has been seen by all of these other people."

The Duke boys race <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> customized 1969 Dodge Charger stock car, dubbed (The) General Lee, evading crooked and corrupt county commissioner Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke) and his bumbling and corrupt Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (James Best) along with his deputy(s), and always managing to {{get caught in the}} middle of the various escapades and incidents that often occur in the area. Bo and Luke had previously been sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of moonshine; their Uncle Jesse made a plea bargain with the U.S. Government to refrain from distilling moonshine in exchange for Bo and Luke's freedom. As a result, Bo and Luke are on probation and not allowed to carry firearmsâ€” instead, they often use compound bows, sometimes with arrows tipped with dynamite â€” or to leave Hazzard County unless they get probation permission from their probation officer, Boss Hogg, although the exact details of their probation terms vary from episode to episode. Sometimes it is implied that they would be jailed for merely crossing the county line; on other occasions, it is shown that they may leave Hazzard, as long as they are back within a certain time limit. Several other technicalities of their probation also came into play at various times.|$|E

2500|$|On 21 August 1941, a French Communist Pierre Georges assassinated the German {{naval officer}} Anton Moser in the Paris Metro, {{which was the}} first time the {{resistance}} had killed a German. The German Military Governor General Otto von StÃ¼lpnagel promptly had three people shot in retaliation for Moser's assassination who had nothing to do with his killing. General StÃ¼lpnagel announced on 22 August 1941 that for every German killed, he would execute at least ten innocent French people in retaliation and that all Frenchmen in German custody were now hostages. On 30 September 1941 StÃ¼lpnagel issued the [...] "Code of Hostages" [...] ordering all district chiefs to draw lists of hostages to be executed in the event of further [...] "incidents" [...] with a special emphasis on French Jews and people known for Communist or Gaullist sympathies. On 20 October 1941, Obersleutnant Karl Friedrich Hotz, the Feldkommandant of Nantes was assassinated on the streets of Nantes while the military lawyer Dr. Hans-Gottfried Reimers was assassinated in Bordeaux on 21 October. The Wehrmacht immediately shot 50 French people who had nothing to do with Hotz's assassination in retaliation in Nantes and announced if the assassin did not turn himself in by midnight of 23 October, another 50 would be shot. The assassin did not turn himself in and so another 50 hostages were shot. One of those shot at Nantes was LÃ©on Jost, a former Socialist deputy and one legged veteran of the First World War who was already serving a three-year prison sentence for helping Jews to escape into Spain. The same day, the Feldkommandant of Bordeaux had 50 French hostages shot in that city in retaliation for Reimers's assassination. The executions of hostages in Nantes and Bordeaux started a debate about the morality of assassination that lasted until the end of the occupation with many French people arguing that since the Germans were willing to shoot so many innocent people in reprisal for killing only one German that it was not worth it and others contending that to cease assassinations would mean giving in to German terror, that it would prove that terror worked and the Germans could brutally push the French <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own country. General de Gaulle went on the BBC's French language service on 23 October to ask that PCF to call in their assassins, saying that killing one German would not change the outcome of the war one iota and that too many innocent people were being shot by Germans in reprisals. As the PCF did not recognize de Gaulle's authority, the Communist assassins continued their work under the slogan [...] "an eye for an eye", and so the Germans continued to execute anywhere between 50â€“100 French hostages for every one of their numbers slain by the Communist assassins.|$|E
