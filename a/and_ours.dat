5|$|By 1892, Imaginos {{is living}} in a mansion in Cornwall and has a nine-year-old granddaughter. Having by this time spent several decades {{studying}} mysticism and astrology, Imaginos discovers that Elizabethan England's rise as a superpower coincided with John Dee's acquisition of a magic obsidian mirror from Mexico, {{which serves as a}} bridge between Les Invisibles' alien world <b>and</b> <b>ours,</b> and the means to spread their influence on Earth. Some fans see Les Invisibles' actions in favour of England against Spain as a sort of vengeance for the extermination by the conquistadores of their worshippers in Central America, while others view their intervention as only part of the mysterious scheme carried on by the alien entities through the centuries ("In the Presence of Another World").|$|E
5|$|Humans {{exist in}} an {{alternate}} Domain, and {{are referred to}} as creatures with no natural defenses. Most believe that they are fictional creatures; but a few, including the Dewclaws, know that they exist. This was developed further in 2003 by the introduction of the character Danielle, a human who enters the animal world via the Bermuda Triangle and transforms into a rabbit. However, she later has a son, Francis, who is born human. The series features jokes on a variety of topics. Many draw satirical parallels between its world <b>and</b> <b>ours,</b> making fun and sometimes social commentary on politics, sports, society, class-snobbery, school, technology, pop culture and corporate culture, for example; in January 2008 the Predator's Union was described as going on strike, in a parody of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{five decades}} in Hollywood, Fonda {{cultivated}} a strong, appealing screen image in such classics as The Ox-Bow Incident, Mister Roberts, and 12 Angry Men. Later, Fonda moved both toward darker epics such as Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West and lighter roles in family comedies such as Yours, Mine <b>and</b> <b>Ours</b> with Lucille Ball, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 54th Academy Awards {{for the movie}} On Golden Pond, his final film role.|$|E

500|$|The {{last two}} {{segments}} were also parodies of popular culture. [...] "Dial D for Diddily" [...] featured various {{references to the}} television series, Dexter, the titular character whom Ned Flanders is supposed to represent when he goes on a killing spree. The music in the segment is the original music from the main title theme of Dexter by Rolfe Kent, although the title references Dial M for Murder. Two of the targets, Patty and Selma Bouvier, {{were killed in a}} similar fashion to the style of Wile E. Coyote. [...] "In the Na'vi" [...] was a parody of the 2009 film Avatar.

2500|$|Rickover {{believed}} that U.S. standards of education were unacceptably low.

[...] A second book, Swiss Schools <b>and</b> <b>Ours</b> (1962) was a scathing comparison of the educational systems of Switzerland and America. He argued that the higher standards of Swiss schools, including a longer school day and year, combined with an approach stressing student choice and academic specialization produced superior results.|$|E
