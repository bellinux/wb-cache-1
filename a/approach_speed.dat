5|$|Wind figures {{prominently}} in several popular sports, including recreational hang gliding, hot air ballooning, kite flying, snowkiting, kite landboarding, kite surfing, paragliding, sailing, and windsurfing. In gliding, wind gradients {{just above the}} surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed {{to deal with the}} effect of the gradient. When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher <b>approach</b> <b>speed</b> to compensate for it.|$|E

25|$|The Mirage F1 used a shoulder-mounted swept wing, {{instead of}} the Delta wing of the Mirage III, which {{resulted}} in a more than 50% reduction in required runway lengths and increased internal fuel tankage for 40% greater combat range. The <b>approach</b> <b>speed</b> prior to landing is 25% less than the preceding Mirage IIIE. According to Dassault, the negative performance impact associated with the increased thickness of the Mirage F1's wing over the Mirage III's counterpart had been offset by improvements made to the propulsion system. The wing is fitted with both double-slotted trailing edge flaps and full-span leading edge slats, the latter being automatically operated to reduce the aircraft's turn radius during combat.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{this period}} both the US and USSR {{were working on}} anti-ballistic missile systems. Developing an ABM system was largely an {{engineering}} issue, requiring radars with high resolution and targeting computers that could adjust trajectories fast enough given an <b>approach</b> <b>speed</b> in thousands of miles an hour. Even though these items would be expensive, the ABM interceptor itself was likely to cost {{about the same as}} an ICBM (or less), so any increase in the enemy's stockpile could be countered for an additional expenditure of about the same amount. This was a game the US was clearly willing to play, although it would seem the USSR was considerably less capable of doing so given the size of the two countries' respective economies.|$|E

Both the long- and short-runway landings show significant variation from straight or uniformly curved trajectories, denoting considerable 'jockeying' {{on the part of the}} pilot during approach. The long-runway <b>approach</b> <b>speeds</b> were variable and higher than recommended. Considerable float followed by touchdown at speeds well above stall were noted.

On take off, Brown reported very little [...] "swing" [...] and the aircraft was well balanced. On landing, Brown noted that <b>approach</b> <b>speed</b> should be above 145km/h (90mph) and should be held until touchdown. This was to avoid a tendency by the He 111 to drop a wing, especially on the port side.|$|E
500|$|The 35L runway at Congonhas is [...] long. Congonhas' {{counterpart}} in Rio de Janeiro, the Santos Dumont Airport, has an even shorter runway, at [...] Both airports {{receive the same}} type of traffic [...] ranging from small private planes to Boeing 737s and A320s. Many variables affect the landing distance of an aircraft, such as <b>approach</b> <b>speed,</b> weight and the presence of either a tailwind or a headwind. For an Airbus A320, a speed of just [...] higher than normal can result in as much as a 25% increase in the runway length needed to stop an aircraft. Wet weather can also significantly reduce the braking performance of aircraft, leading to an increase in the minimum runway length requirement.|$|E
500|$|The ratio between {{length and}} {{wingspan}} was practically {{the same as}} that of an Avro Lancaster bomber, which had a wingspan of [...] and a length of , in contrast to modern sport gliders which possess a particularly large wingspan to enhance gliding performance. This was the result of a decision taken by the War Office in early 1940 on how military gliders would be used; the idea was for the glider to be released at a low altitude close to the landing zone and conduct a steep descent to reduce time in the air and exposure to enemy fire. The glider also possessed large flaps which assisted in a steep and rapid descent, and through adjustments of their angle during landing a precise control over descent rate and point of landing could be achieved; they also allowed a slower touchdown speed to be attained. They were operated through a small bottle of compressed air large enough only for a single landing; a small bottle not only saved weight, but gave a smaller chance of it being hit by enemy fire, thereby exploding and damaging the glider. Standard <b>approach</b> <b>speed</b> for the Hamilcar was , although for shorter landings this could be slowed to , and stalling speeds were [...] with flaps up or [...] with flaps deployed. The Hamilcar was fitted with tailwheel landing gear, with oleo-pneumatic shock absorbers that could be deflated to bring the fuselage nose down for loading or unloading purposes. A jettisonable undercarriage was initially designed for the glider, as it was discovered that it travelled for a shorter distance when it landed only on its skids. However, this was eventually replaced with a fixed undercarriage – the same as had been designed for ferrying operations – as pilots found that they preferred to land on wheels because of the extra control it gave them and the ability to avoid other gliders and potential collisions in the landing area. The wheeled undercarriage was not fitted until after the glider had been loaded; two 15-ton jacks were used to lift the aircraft for the fitting.|$|E
50|$|The delta {{configuration}} {{offers a}} relatively high cruise speed compared to conventional aircraft of the same weight and power and {{a relatively high}} stall speed of 70 to 75 Mph. <b>Approach</b> <b>speeds</b> range from 110 to 100 mph with a flare at 70 mph.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a flight test program to determine the effects on landings of wide variations in approach path angle and approach airspeed for different kinds of piloting technique. Over 400 landings were made at <b>approach</b> <b>speeds</b> from 60 to 120 mph and approach path angles from 3 to 18 deg. Several variations of pilot technique involving different operations of the throttle/spoiler control were investigated. It is shown that very large ranges of airspeed and approach path angle can be accommodated with rather moderate penalties in landing distance and difficulty. With the spoiler-equipped aircraft, the best <b>approach</b> <b>speeds</b> are considerably higher than would be usable without spoilers, and approach path angles can be used which are far beyond those normally possible without spoilers...|$|R

2500|$|Depending on the <b>approach</b> <b>speed</b> of trains, to a {{passenger}} {{it may seem}} that flashing aspects have failed when they have not. [...] This is because the train passes the signal too quickly for a complete cycle to be observed from side-on.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} week of June 1956, a new maximum-minimum {{airspeed}} indicator was installed in a Boeing B-47 Stratojet to undergo operational suitability testing. [...] "The new instrument, resembling the standard type indicator, differs in that it will determine the stall speed of an aircraft at any specific time. It will also compute the <b>approach</b> <b>speed</b> of the aircraft to aid the pilot in attaining proper speeds for landing. In the past, with the standard type indicator, pilots have had to determine the <b>approach</b> <b>speed</b> of the aircraft through a mental process of totaling the weight of the fuel load and the operating weight of the aircraft to arrive at the gross weight. This was then applied to a chart to determine the proper <b>approach</b> <b>speed</b> of the aircraft. This method, using the standard indicator, left room for error. With the high speed aircraft of today, pilots must be accurate in determining the speed in order to prevent stalling or approaching the landing strip too fast. The new maximum-minimum air speed indicator is designed to prevent errors that might be made by mental calculations of the pilot. The testing of the new indicator is under the supervision of Major Oliver D. Taylor, 3245th Test Group (Bombardment), Air Force Operational Test Center." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hersman said: [...] "In this flight, in {{the last}} 2.5 minutes of the flight, from data on the flight data {{recorder}} we see multiple autopilot modes and multiple autothrottle modes [...] We need to understand what those modes were, if they were commanded by pilots, if they were activated inadvertently, if the pilots understood what the mode was doing."

Based on preliminary data from the flight data recorder (FDR), the NTSB said the plane's airspeed on final approach fell to 34 knots below its target <b>approach</b> <b>speed</b> of 137 knots (254km/h; 158mph). A preliminary review of FAA radar return data did not show an abnormally steep descent curve, although the crew did recognize that they began high on the final approach. At a height of , eight seconds before impact, the airspeed had dropped to [...] According to initial reports from the cockpit crew, the plane's autothrottle was set for the correct reference speed, but until the runway's precision approach path indicator (PAPI) showed them significantly below the glide path, the pilots were unaware the autothrottle was failing to maintain that speed. The instructor pilot stated that the PAPI indicated a deviation below the glide path at approximately 500 feet above ground level, and he attempted to correct it at that time. Between 500 and 200 feet, the instructor pilot also reported a lateral deviation which they attempted to correct.|$|E

2500|$|USAir {{submitted}} to the NTSB that pilots should receive training with regard to a plane's crossover speed and recovery from full rudder deflection. As a result, pilots were warned of and trained {{how to deal with}} insufficient aileron authority at an airspeed at or less than , formerly the usual <b>approach</b> <b>speed</b> for a Boeing 737. Boeing maintained that the most likely cause of the crash was that the co-pilot inadvertently deflected the rudder hard-over in the wrong direction while in a panic and for unknown reasons maintained this input until impact with the ground. According to aviation law firm Katzman, Lampert, and McClune, which represented families and victims of both US Air 427 and United 585, Boeing did not contest in open court that its 737's rudder was prone to an uncommanded rudder issue while in flight. Nonetheless, Boeing agreed to redesign the rudder control system with a redundant backup and paid for the retrofit of the entire worldwide 737 fleet. As one of the NTSB's main recommendations, airlines were required to add four additional channels of information — pilot rudder pedal commands — into flight data recorders, to which the FAA gave airlines until August 2001 to comply. In 2016, former investigator John Cox stated that time so far has proven the NTSB correct in their findings due to the absence of a rudder reversal incident since Boeing's redesign.|$|E
