5|$|Archaeologists {{have not}} been able to recover enough of Kronans sculptures for a {{detailed}} reconstruction of the ornamentation. The mascarons (architectural facemasks) and putti (images of children) that were salvaged as of 2007 show considerable artistic quality according to Soop. A large sculpture of a warrior figure was found in 1987 and is an example of high-quality workmanship, possibly even a symbolic portrait of King Charles. Since nothing is known of the surrounding ornamentation <b>and</b> <b>sculptures,</b> the conclusion remains speculative.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{has many}} uses in the {{construction}} industry; lead sheets are used as architectural metals in roofing material, cladding, flashing, gutters and gutter joints, and on roof parapets. Detailed lead moldings are used as decorative motifs to fix lead sheet. Lead is still used in statues <b>and</b> <b>sculptures,</b> including for armatures. In the past it was often used to balance the wheels of cars; for environmental reasons this use is being phased {{out in favor of}} other materials.|$|E

40|$|Every {{child is}} an artist. The problem {{is how to}} remain an artist once we grow up. " - Pablo Picasso The {{dissertation}} entitled Interdisciplinary Integration of Drawing <b>and</b> <b>Sculpture</b> focuses on exploring the association between drawing <b>and</b> <b>sculpture</b> in the second three-year cycle of the primary school. I would like to present the interdisciplinary integration in visual arts education as a successful strategy for exploring certain areas. The {{emphasis is on the}} question of how the class teacher plans artistic tasks that include integration with a particular focus on drawing <b>and</b> <b>sculpture.</b> I am also interested in the goals that teachers want to achieve in such classes and the opinion they have of their own integrating skills. I want to establish whether teachers have sufficient didactic and professional knowledge on integration of drawing <b>and</b> <b>sculpture</b> in art classes and which materials they most commonly use when planning such tasks. I am also interested in the art techniques teachers most often use when integrating drawing <b>and</b> <b>sculpture,</b> which artistic motifs pupils most often depict, and {{what is the role of}} drawing in the pupils’ planning of the sculptural structure. I will analyze three teachers’ lesson plans which will include the tasks of artistic integration of drawing <b>and</b> <b>sculpture,</b> <b>and</b> I will also present a formal analysis of the pupils’ art works. The work is an in-depth look at integration of drawing <b>and</b> <b>sculpture</b> in the second three-year cycle of primary school. It provides an insight on the professional and didactic skills of class teachers in art classes and certain artistic fields. ...|$|R
5|$|The Cummer Gardens are 1.45 {{acres of}} {{historic}} gardens {{made up of}} native Florida plants, large live oak trees, {{and a number of}} reflecting pools, fountains, ornaments <b>and</b> <b>sculptures.</b> They are split into three themed gardens and a large lawn on the St. Johns River. Many of the original trees on the property were felled in order to make room for flower beds, but those that remained grew up to 150 feet in size. Ninah Cummer adopted the lion as her personal motif, and lion details can be found all over the gardens.|$|E
5|$|The Muisca {{constructed}} ceramic pottery for cooking, {{the extraction}} of salt from brines, as decorative ritual pieces and for the consumption of their alcoholic beverage; chicha. Large ceramic jars were found around the sacred archaeoastronomical site of El Infiernito, used for massive rituals where the people celebrated their festivities drinking chicha. Also musical instruments such as ocarinas were made of ceramics. The ceramic pots <b>and</b> <b>sculptures</b> were painted with zoomorphic figures that were common in the Muisca territory; frogs, armadillos, snakes and lizards. Main ceramic production centres were located close to the abundance of clays, in Tocancipá, Gachancipá, Cogua, Guatavita, Guasca and Ráquira.|$|E

On the other hand, the chapel in San Pietro de Dom, commissioned to Gasparo Cairano in 1504 is the only documented work of the sculptor that has been completely lost.|$|E
