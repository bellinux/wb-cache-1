40|$|In {{this thesis}} three {{independent}} {{answers to the}} question ‘what is attention?’ are provided. Each answer is a description <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> given {{through one of the}} perspectives that people have on the mental phenomenon. The first answer is the common-sense answer to the question, and is an account of the folk psychology <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b> The understanding <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> put forward here is <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> as a limited, divisible resource that is used in mental acts. The second answer is the empirical answer to the question, and is an account of the metaphysics <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b> The understanding <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> put forward here is the account <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> proposed by Christopher Mole in his theory <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> as cognitive unison. The third answer is the experiential answer to the question, and is an account of the phenomenology <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b> The understanding <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> put forward here is <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> as a kind of directed mental effort. These three answers to the question are shown to be intimately related to each other, and to inform each other in important ways. They are also shown to be fundamentally different answers to each other with none being reducible to another, or more important than another. In the end, they will be found to be answers that arise from the differing perspectives that people are restricted to when considering the nature of mental phenomena, perspectives that must be recognised if an account of such phenomena is to be provided...|$|R
