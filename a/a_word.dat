5|$|The {{traditional}} long {{scale is}} used by most Continental European countries and by most other countries whose languages derive from Continental Europe (with the notable exceptions of Albania, Greece, Romania, and Brazil).

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>word</b> in the computer's memory {{could be}} read, written, or refreshed, in 360microseconds. An {{instruction}} took {{four times as}} long to execute as accessing <b>a</b> <b>word</b> from memory, giving an instruction execution rate of about 700 per second. The main store was refreshed continuously, a process which took 20milliseconds to complete, as each of the SSEM's 32words had to be read and then refreshed in sequence.|$|E
5|$|Assonance, {{where the}} use of similar vowel sounds within <b>a</b> <b>word</b> rather than similar sounds at the {{beginning}} or end of <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> was widely used in skaldic poetry, but {{goes back to the}} Homeric epic. Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry. Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the length}} of closure is {{defined in terms of}} time between the closure of the vocal tract after the {{preceding}} vowel, and the release before the following vowel, stops at the beginning or end of <b>a</b> <b>word</b> do not have a fortis-lenis contrast.

50|$|Overlapping {{semantics}} {{are difficult}} to distinguish, especially in translation. Words with multiple meanings (polysemous words) are mostly untranslatable, especially if they contain many connotations.Confusion of sense relations can also result because of semantic overlap. Confusion of sense relations in the set includes the improper use of superonym for hyponym, hyponym for superonym, <b>a</b> whole <b>word</b> for <b>a</b> partial <b>word,</b> <b>a</b> partial <b>word</b> for <b>a</b> whole <b>word,</b> antonym, confusion of co-hyponyms, and misuse of near-synonyms.|$|R

5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand <b>a</b> <b>word</b> or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E
