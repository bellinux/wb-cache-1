Lady Catherine, having heard rumors that Elizabeth intends to marry Darcy, visits Elizabeth and demands that she {{promise not to}} accept his proposal. Elizabeth makes no such promise and Lady Catherine leaves, outraged by Elizabeth's {{perceived}} insolence. Darcy, heartened by Elizabeth's refusal to promise that she wouldn't accept such a proposal, again proposes to Elizabeth and is accepted. He visits Longbourn to <b>ask</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bennet for his permission. [...] Elizabeth wants her father to understand {{that she is not}} marrying for money, and it is only after she speaks about Mr. Darcy's true worth that he is happy about the wedding.|$|E
2500|$|In 1867 Restieaux was foreman of a Guano {{excavation}} {{operation at}} McKean Island, in the Phoenix Islands (which {{is now part}} of Kiribati). Towards the end of 1867 he was a passenger on the brig Kamehameka going to Honolulu for a vacation. At this time Ben Pease was the captain of the schooner the Blossom and trading in coconut and coconut oil in the Marshall Islands. As trading was good, in late 1867 Pease sent George Bridges, his mate, to Honolulu to <b>ask</b> <b>Mr.</b> C. A. Williams, the owner of the Blossom, to supply another schooner and to engage someone to take charge of the trading station at Ponape atoll (now known as Pohnpei). Williams engaged Restieaux for the position on Ponape and sent the schooner Malolo under Captain Bridges. [...] The Malolo arrived at Mili Atoll on 1 March 1868. Instead of going to Ponape, Restieaux was put in charge of the Mili station. After nine months Williams sold his firm to Glover Dow & Co. of Shanghai. Mr. Williams wrote to Restieaux telling him he was to look to Glover Dow & Co for his pay â€“ Restieaux was never paid as the company became insolvent.|$|E

No doubt he did this sufficiently. But I don't <b>ask.</b> <b>Mr.</b> Razumov inspires confidence. It is a great gift. I only suggest that a more prolonged absence might awaken the criminal's suspicions and induce him perhaps to change his plans." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very well. But'--with suspicion--'why {{did you not}} <b>ask</b> <b>Mr</b> Philpott? Your House-master {{can give}} you leave to go to Stapleton.' ...|$|E
