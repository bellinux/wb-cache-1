5|$|Warfare in Normandy at {{the time}} was shaped by the {{defensive}} potential of castles and the increasing costs of conducting campaigns. The Norman frontiers had limited natural defences but were heavily reinforced with castles, such as Château Gaillard, at strategic points, built and maintained at considerable expense. It was difficult for a commander to advance far into fresh territory without having secured his lines of communication by capturing these fortifications, which slowed the progress of any attack. Armies of the period could be formed from either feudal or mercenary forces. Feudal levies could only be raised for a fixed length of time before they returned home, forcing an end to a campaign; mercenary forces, often called Brabançons after the Duchy of Brabant but actually recruited from across northern Europe, could operate <b>all</b> <b>year</b> <b>long</b> and provide a commander with more strategic options to pursue a campaign, but cost much more than equivalent feudal forces. As a result, commanders of the period were increasingly drawing on larger numbers of mercenaries.|$|E

25|$|Homeless shelters, which {{generally}} are night shelters, make people {{leave in the}} morning to whatever they could manage and return in the evening when the beds in the shelters opened up again for sleeping. There are some daytime shelters where people could go, instead of being stranded on the streets, and they could be helped, get counseling, avail themselves of resources, meals, and otherwise spend their day until returning to their overnight sleeping arrangements.

25|$|The {{length of}} the mite's cycle depends on species and {{environment}} but normally lasts two to 12 months. The number of cycles in a year depends on the region. For example, in a temperate region, there might only be three per year, but in tropical regions the cycle might be continuous <b>all</b> <b>year</b> <b>long.</b> Adult harvest mites overwinter in protected places such as slightly below the soil. Females become active in the spring, and once the ground temperature is regularly above , she lays eggs in vegetation, up to 15 eggs per day.
