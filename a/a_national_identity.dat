5|$|The ethnic Macedonian {{rulers of}} the Ptolemaic and Seleucid {{successor}} states accepted men {{from all over the}} Greek world as their hetairoi companions and did not foster <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> like the Antigonids. Modern scholarship has focused on how these Hellenistic successor kingdoms were influenced more by their Macedonian origins than Eastern or southern Greek traditions. While Spartan society remained mostly insular and Athens continued placing strict limitations on acquiring citizenship, the cosmopolitan Hellenistic cities of Asia and northeastern Africa bore a greater resemblance to Macedonian cities and contained a mixture of subjects including natives, Greek and Macedonian colonists, and Greek-speaking Hellenized Easterners, many of whom were the product of intermarriage between Greeks and native populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{stories were}} written when Irish {{nationalism}} {{was at its}} peak and a search for <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> and purpose was raging; at a crossroads of history and culture, Ireland was jolted by converging ideas and influences. The stories centre on Joyce's idea of an epiphany: a moment when a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many {{of the characters in}} Dubliners later appear in minor roles in Joyce's novel Ulysses. The initial stories in the collection are narrated by child protagonists. Subsequent stories deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyce's tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence and maturity.|$|E
5|$|The 5th century saw the {{withdrawal}} of Imperial Roman support from Britain, and the succeeding centuries, the Dark Ages, witnessed the emergence of <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> and of kingdoms. The area which would become the Rhondda lay within Glywysing, an area that incorporated the modern area of Glamorgan, ruled by a dynasty founded by Glywys. This dynasty was later replaced by another founded by Meurig ap Tewdrig whose descendant Morgan ap Owain would give Glamorgan its Welsh name Morgannwg. With {{the coming of the}} Norman overlords after the 1066 Battle of Hastings, south-east Wales was divided into five cantrefi. The Rhondda lay within Penychen, a narrow strip running between modern day Glyn Neath and the coast between Cardiff and Aberthaw. Each cantref was further divided into commotes, with Penychen made up of five such commotes, one being Glynrhondda.|$|E

40|$|This article {{critically}} {{examines the}} elusive search for <b>a</b> true <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> in Nigeria amid persistent ethno-religious conflicts and violent attacks in Nigeria today.

The analysis is historically anchored and foregrounds colonial policies that blocked the processes of nation building in postindependence Nigeria.
