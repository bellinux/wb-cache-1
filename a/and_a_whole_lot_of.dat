[...] Brian Lowry of Variety concluded that [...] "Lost … approaches its twists with {{what appears to be a}} greater degree of intellectual rigor than almost anything else on primetime. [...] Even when it's difficult to keep track of the myriad connections, a sense lingers that somebody knows—which is strangely reassuring." [...] Despite being more interested in the romantic aspirations of the show's characters, Jennifer Godwin of E! remarked that [...] "the Lost mythology is a miracle to behold. [...] It's grandiose, compelling, gaspworthy and, despite what the haters would have you believe, altogether satisfying". [...] Katherine Nichols of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin enjoyed the opening scene, [...] "but the rest of it didn't capture [...] as [...] hoped it would", citing high expectations due to the eight-month hiatus after the fourth season finale and a possible [...] "yearning for more character-driven stories over machinations revolving around time travel, however clever they might be."

2500|$|Lopez {{has been}} {{influenced}} by artists such as Tina Turner, James Brown, Michael Jackson, Madonna and Barbra Streisand. She credited Rita Moreno's performance in the 1961 musical film West Side Story as a major inspiration. Critics have considered Lopez's voice to be limited, and obscured by the production of her music, while remaining [...] "radio-friendly". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone observed: [...] "Instead of strained vocal pyrotechnics, Lopez sticks to the understated R murmur of a round-the-way superstar who doesn't need to belt because she knows you're already paying attention [...] She makes a little va-va <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> voom go a long way." [...] Meanwhile, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called her voice [...] "slight" [...] and wrote: [...] "Lopez was never, ever about singing; she was about style".

Invalid Channel said [...] "you can really tell that they've taken all of the footage themselves, it's not one-sided stock footage from the developing company. The hosts really play the games themselves and it shows, but you know that you're getting a real opinion from someone who played the game and know exactly how it handles and how annoying all those bugs are, not two people reading straight from some sort of rigid script." [...] He adds that [...] "being on a non-commercial network helps too" [...] as if the show was on a commercial network it may be more successful, but its credibility would be lost as [...] "once the game companies start paying sponsorship, you'd be seeing a lot of 10/10's <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> kiss-ass".|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 75, based on 36 reviews. Laura Foster of Clash called the album a [...] "confident, cohesive effort" [...] {{and found that}} [...] "he steady hand of Paul Epworth on production has helped Florence to take the winning formula of her distinctive vocals and melodies, the twinkling harps and thundering drums, and augment it with string arrangements, subtle electro touches, and gospel choirs." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Kyle Anderson praised it as a [...] "confident, unflinching tour de force" [...] and commented, [...] "If her acclaimed 2009 debut, Lungs, was a scrappy shrine to survival and empowerment, its follow-up is a baroque cathedral, bedecked with ornate tapestries made of ghostly choirs, pagan-rhythmic splendor, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> harp." [...] AllMusic critic James Christopher Monger wrote, [...] "Bigger and bolder than 2009's excellent Lungs, Ceremonials rolls in like fog over the Thames, doling out a heavy-handed mix of Brit-pop-infused neo-soul anthems and lush, movie trailer-ready ballads that fuse the bluesy, electro-despair of Adele with the ornate, gothic melodrama of Kate Bush and Floodland-era Sisters of Mercy." ...|$|E

Greenfield described this need to [...] "say things between two commercials" [...] as the media's requirement for [...] "concision". Chomsky has elaborated on this, saying that [...] "the beauty of [...] is that you can only repeat conventional thoughts. If you repeat conventional thoughts, you require zero evidence, like saying Osama Bin Laden is a bad guy, no evidence is required. However, if you say something that is true, although not a conventional truth, like the United States attacked South Vietnam, people are going to rightfully want evidence, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> it, as they should. The format of the shows do not allow this type of evidence {{which is one of the}} reasons concision is critical." [...] He's continued that if the media were better propagandists they would invite dissidents to speak more often because the time restraint would stop them from properly explaining their radical views and they [...] "would sound like they were from Neptune." [...] For this reason, Chomsky rejects many offers to appear on TV, preferring the written medium.|$|E

A writer of The Huffington Post {{described}} the video as [...] "characteristically kinetic". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound wrote that [...] "the concept may be simple, but the intricate dance numbers (take that, Fred Astaire!) and split screen action make for an energetic cinematic affair with loads of modern swag and '60s-inspired sass." [...] Joe Marvilli of the same publication wrote that the retro horns in the song, match the 1960s [...] "throwback visuals" [...] as Knowles [...] "sashes through a variety of classy outfits and energetic dance moves. It's as full of sass and swagger, as if she'd give us any less". Entertainment Weeklys Grady Smith compared Knowles with Nicki Minaj and called the video a [...] "typical Beyoncé dance-fest featuring frenetic movement, flashing colors, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> sexy outfits". Contessa Gayles of [...] The Boombox also compared Knowles look and make-up in the video with Minajs style. Lisa Potter of Marie Claire compared Knowles with Andy Warhol. Carrie Battan of Pitchfork Media called it a [...] "clean and classic, filled with blocked colors, Audrey Hepburn stylings and the occasional flashing of the baby bump". Luke Jennings of The Guardian called the video a [...] "slick, very new-retro piece of film-making, and borrowed imagery is absolutely the point of it". Stereogum wrote that the video [...] "has [...] potential to be the most electric Beyoncé video since the immortal classic 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)'". Similarly, Matt Donnelly of Los Angeles Times described the video as [...] "so fantastic it borders on annoying" [...] and added that it could be a miniature version of [...] "Single Ladies".

2500|$|Natasha Kassulke of the Wisconsin State Journal stated [...] "The concert {{captured}} {{the scope of}} Jackson's talent from songwriter to singer, producer, actress, dancer and fashion diva." [...] Similarly, Gemma Tarlach of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel observed, [...] "A tiny dynamo of constant motion, Jackson strutted, slunk and grooved her way {{from one end of}} the stage to the other... Her voice, sometimes thin and girlish on her albums, sounded fuller and more powerful than ever. Michael's baby sister? Nope, the commander of her own rhythm nation, in complete control. The show was as much a feast visually as musically." [...] Kevin Johnson of St. Louis Post-Dispatch commended the tour as [...] "one of the flashiest on the concert scene." [...] Elizabeth Aird, who reviewed Jackson's concert at GM Place, wrote [...] "If there's a show sexier and more polished than Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope extravaganza, it's only on Broadway... Saturday night's show at GM Place was two hours of thrills pumped out by Jackson, her never-say-die dancers and her powerful band." [...] James Sullivan of the San Francisco Chronicle observed her concert at the new arena [...] "offered a career retrospective, punctuated by new material, periodic video diversions and fireworks." [...] "The show was a lot like an '80s flashback, though to its credit Jackson's eight-piece band—bass, guitar, drums and percussion, two keyboardists and two backup singers—added some inventive layering to her older hits." [...] Charles Passy of the Palm Beach Post reported Jackson's show at the Coral Sky Amphitheatre emphasized style over substance, commenting her [...] "two-hour set was about half hormones—and half pyrotechnics. Without much in the way of a voice, she has sold her persona throughout her career. And as that persona has evolved from girlish teenager to sexually sophisticated woman, her albums—and tours—have provided a road map." [...] Jet Magazine reported, [...] "With wit, sass, dance <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> sex appeal, Janet turns her song and dance fest into one of the major musical events of the year.
