5|$|Until 1864, {{communications}} between Fort Greble {{and its neighbors}} had to be routed through departmental headquarters in Washington. After <b>a</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system completely failed, {{efforts were made to}} establish signaling points between the forts, and the forts themselves were connected to Washington via telegraph wire. Signal detachments were present at Fort Stanton, near Uniontown, and sometimes visited Fort Greble as part of training efforts.|$|E
5|$|A Junkers F.13 {{called at}} Lympne on 10 January 1923 {{to clear customs}} and then flew to Croydon where it was {{inspected}} by Secretary of State for Air Sir Samuel Hoare. In February, {{it was reported that}} Lympne had taken part in <b>a</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newly introduced Mayday radio signal used by aircraft to indicate that they were in distress. Georges Barbot won a prize of F.25,000 from Le Matin when he made a flight from St Inglevert to Lympne and back again on the same day, 6 May. He flew the route in a Dewoitine aircraft fitted with a Clerget engine. On landing a bracing wire in the undercarriage of the aircraft broke, but repairs were effected within half an hour. Problems starting the engine then delayed his departure slightly. On 28 October the Light Aircraft Trials were held (see below). In 1923, Air Union started a service flying newspapers to Lympne using a Farman F.60 Goliath.|$|E

5|$|In 1834, Charles Wheatstone {{developed}} {{a method of}} using a rapidly rotating mirror to study transient phenomena, and applied this method to measure the velocity of electricity in a wire and the duration of an electric spark. He communicated to François Arago the idea that his method could be adapted to {{a study of the}} speed of light. Arago expanded upon Wheatstone's concept in an 1838 publication, emphasizing the possibility that <b>a</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relative speed of light in air versus water could be used to distinguish between the particle and wave theories of light.|$|E
5|$|In February and March 2011, Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism {{sponsored}} <b>a</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> route by shipping {{roof tiles}} to Europe via the Trans-Siberian.

If successful, the ministry would use the results of the test to encourage other Japanese companies to utilize the Trans-Siberian over the sea route.|$|E
5|$|The 18th {{century was}} not a {{particularly}} prosperous time for the Inn or its members, and few notable barristers were members during this period. Some noted members include Sir Thomas Clarke, the Master of the Rolls, Sir James Eyre, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Samuel Romilly, a noted law reformer. In 1780 the Inn {{was involved in the}} case of R v the Benchers of Gray's Inn, <b>a</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role of the Inns of Court as the sole authority to call students to the Bar. The case was brought to the Court of King's Bench by William Hart, a student at the Inn, who asked the court (under Lord Mansfield) to order the Inn to call him to the Bar. Mansfield ruled that the Inns of Court were indeed the only organisations able to call students to the Bar, and refused to order the Inns to call Hart.|$|E

The logistical haul overrun and captured by the allied forces in the Base Areas was indeed impressive. 20,000 individual and 2,500 crew-served weapons; 7,000 tons of rice; 1,800 tons of munitions; 140,000 rockets and artillery shells; 435 vehicles; 29 tons of communications equipment; 55 tons of medical supplies; and 199,552 anti-aircraft rounds. The incursion was, however, limited in its scale and scope. Nixon had limited the depth of penetration by U.S. forces to 35 kilometers and placed a 30 June deadline for the withdrawal of American troops to South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Varis zos Galvus is crowned Garlean {{emperor and}} begins {{consolidating}} power, lending new urgency {{to the search}} for Ivy. The Braves discover that Ivy is Raubahn's trusted advisor Eline Roaille, who is captured at the gates of a Garlean Castrum. A new Scion, Moenbryda, arrives from Sharlayan and provides critical advice for locating Iceheart. Using her body as a vessel, Iceheart summons Shiva into herself and challenges the Warrior of Light. Though the adventurer's band defeats Shiva, Iceheart escapes, bidding the meddler to consult with Midgardsormr. Based on the player's encounters with Lahabrea and Shiva, Moenbryda hypothesizes that Ascians may be permanently destroyed by trapping their souls within white auracite and cleaving them with a blast of pure aether, much like Hydaelyn's blade of light. Lucia of the Temple Knights requests that the Warrior of Light investigate suspicious activity at the Keeper of the Lake. At its apex, the adventurer discovers that Midgardsormr lives on, slowly regenerating from his apparent death. He divulges that Nidhogg, one of his seven children, has rallied the Dravanian horde to renew their attack on Ishgard. Sensing the hero's connection to Hydaelyn, Midgardsormr invokes an ancient pact with the Mothercrystal and seals away her blessing as <b>a</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> player's worth. The Ascian Nabriales takes advantage of the opportunity to infiltrate the Scions' headquarters in pursuit of Louisoix's staff. Moenbryda sacrifices herself to create the blade of light necessary to completely destroy the Ascian.|$|E
