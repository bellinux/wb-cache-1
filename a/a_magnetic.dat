5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when <b>a</b> <b>magnetic</b> field is applied. In reverse, it produces <b>a</b> <b>magnetic</b> field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. The coil either induces <b>a</b> <b>magnetic</b> {{field in the}} transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> fossil <b>magnetic</b> field {{embedded}} in the radiative core of the Sun has been thought possible for some time now. However, such <b>a</b> fossil <b>magnetic</b> field has, <b>a</b> priori, not been considered a visible phenomenon due {{to the effects of}} turbulence in the solar convection zone. Since a well developed theory (referred to herein as magnetohydrodynamic dynamo theory) exists for describing the regeneration of magnetic fields in astrophysical objects like the Sun, it is possible to quantitatively evaluate the interaction of <b>a</b> fossil <b>magnetic</b> field with the magnetohydrodynamic dynamo operating in the solar convection zone. In this work, after {{a brief description of the}} basic dynamo equations, a spherical model calculation of the solar dynamo is introduced. First, we calculate the interaction of <b>a</b> fossil <b>magnetic</b> field with <b>a</b> dynamo in which the regeneration mechanisms of cyclonic convection and large-scale, nonuniform rotation are confined to spherical shells. It is argued that the amount of amplification or suppression of <b>a</b> fossil <b>magnetic</b> field will be smallest for a uniform distribution of cyclonic convection and nonuniform rotation, as expected in the Sun. Secondly, we calculate the interaction of <b>a</b> fossil <b>magnetic</b> field with <b>a</b> dynamo having a uniform distribution of cyclonic convection and large-scale, nonuniform rotation. We find that the dipole or quadrupole moments of <b>a</b> fossil <b>magnetic</b> field are suppressed by factors of - 0. 35 and - 0. 37, respectively. The dynamo modified fossil field, superimposed on the theoretically calculated magnetic fields of the solar magnetic cycle, are compared with the actual sunspot cycle and solar magnetic fields as observed by others, indicating that <b>a</b> fossil <b>magnetic</b> field may be responsible for asymmetries in the sunspot cycle and <b>an</b> observed solar <b>magnetic</b> quadrupole moment. Further observations and reduction of the data are required before the presence of <b>a</b> fossil <b>magnetic</b> field can be established. A discussion is given of the implications for the Sun if <b>a</b> fossil <b>magnetic</b> field is observed and identified. It is considered most likely that <b>a</b> fossil <b>magnetic</b> field would be a remnant of the possible Hayashi phase of a fully convective, protosun. Other possibilities also exist...|$|R
30|$|The {{high-resolution}} Co 2 p spectra contain {{two main}} peaks {{that correspond to}} Co 2 p 3 / 2 and 2 p 1 / 2 and two shake-up satellites at higher binding energy. This means that high-spin Co 2 + ions were surrounded by O ions. In addition, for the film oxidized without <b>an</b> applied <b>magnetic</b> field, the energy {{difference between the two}} Co 2 p peaks is 15.58  eV, which {{is similar to that of}} CoO (15.50  eV). This value is 15.29  eV for the film oxidized under <b>an</b> applied <b>magnetic</b> field of 6  T, which is lower than that of CoO and higher than that of Co metal (15.05  eV). This means that the amount of CoO in the film decreases when it is oxidized under <b>a</b> high <b>magnetic</b> field, which is consistent with the above finding that <b>a</b> high <b>magnetic</b> field inhibits oxidation of Zn. Additionally, the Co content of the film oxidized under <b>an</b> applied <b>magnetic</b> field of 6  T was higher than that of the film oxidized without <b>an</b> applied <b>magnetic</b> field, but Co substitution was not. Therefore, Co atoms may form clusters in the film oxidized under <b>a</b> high applied <b>magnetic</b> field.
