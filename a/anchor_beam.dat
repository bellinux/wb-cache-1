50|$|Dutch barn is {{the name}} given to {{markedly}} different types of barns in the United States and Canada, and in the United Kingdom. In the United States, Dutch barns (a. k. a. New World Dutch barns) represent the oldest and rarest types of barns. There are relatively few—probably fewer than 600—of these barns still intact. Common features of these barns include a core structure composed of a steep gabled roof, supported by purlin plates and <b>anchor</b> <b>beam</b> posts, the floor and stone piers below. Little of the weight {{is supported by the}} curtain wall, which could be removed without affecting the stability of the structure. Large beams of pine or oak bridge the center aisle for animals to provide room for threshing. Entry was through paired doors on the gable ends with a pent roof over them, and smaller animal doors at the corners of the same elevations. The Dutch Barn has a square profile, unlike the more rectangular English or German barns. In the United Kingdom a structure called a Dutch barn is a relatively recent agricultural development meant specifically for hay and straw storage; most examples were built from the 19th century. British Dutch barns represent a type of pole barn in common use today. Design styles range from fixed roof to adjustable roof; some Dutch barns have honeycombed brick walls, which provide ventilation and are decorative as well. Still other British Dutch barns may be found with no walls at all, much like American pole barns.|$|E

The application of external prestressing tendons for strengthening of existing bridges has been used in many countries since the 1950 s and has been found to provide an efficient and economic solution {{in a wide range of}} the bridge types and conditions. The objectives of this study are to explain the strengthening process by using external prestressing tendons, test and analyze the anchor beams of Jiamusi {{prestressed concrete}} highway bridge. Three field tests are adopted in this study. These tests are concrete compressive strength test of anchor beams, tensile test of <b>anchor</b> <b>beam</b> re-bars, and tensile test of anchor beams structure and external prestressting tendons. The results of field tests and analysis of anchor beams and external prestressing tendons show that the value of longitudinal deformation is equal to 0. 02 mm and the value of lateral strain ranges from 5 to 1 0 :g. This indicates that the anchor beams have sufficient bending stiffness and the bending capacity of <b>anchor</b> <b>beam</b> is good.

40|$|External {{post-tensioning}} {{is defined}} as a system in which the pre-stressing tendons or bars are located outside the concrete section. The pre-stressing force is transferred to the member section through the end anchorages, deviators or saddles. The objectives of this study are to strengthen Jiamusi pre-stressed concrete highway bridge by using external post-tensioning tendons, to determine the internal forces, and to design the external post-tensioning system. Two software are used in the analysis of the T-shaped cantilever structure and <b>anchor</b> <b>beam.</b> The first is Dr. Bridge software Ver. 3. 1, and the second is Ansys software Ver. 10.

The compressive stress of the upper edge of pier top box section is small, it is only 1. 91 Mpa. Therefore, there is need to strengthen the top of the bridge deck. External post-tensioning tendons are used to strengthen the bridge deck. The selection of external post-tensioning tendons depends on the ASTMA 416 - 90 A specification. The external tendons consist of high strength, low relaxation strands, and the standard tensile strength is 1860 MPa.

However, premature end peeling of CFRP laminate {{has been shown to be}} the main weakness of this method. Development of high shear and normal stresses at the end of strengthening laminate is the key reason to cause end peeling which is not preventable by conventional anchoring system. This paper presents the experimental investigations on the effects of U- and L-shaped steel end anchors on CFRP laminate flexurally strengthened r. c. beams to preclude end peeling. Analytical and numerical models are also used to compare the results. In the experimental programme, four rectangular r. c. beams were fabricated and tested. One beam was left as control and the other three beams were strengthened using CFRP laminates. From the strengthened beams, one was left un-anchored while rest two beams were end-anchored using U- and L-shaped steel plates. Results showed that all strengthened beams exhibited higher crack and ultimate loads along with less deflections and crack widths as compared to those of the control beam. The un-anchored strengthened beam failed by premature end peeling with brittle manner, whereas, U- and L-shaped end <b>anchored</b> strengthened <b>beams</b> failed by shear rather than end peeling.

The horizontal force testing installation was constructed within the steel frame 2. 00 x 2. 00 metre and forced from the side until CBP failure (maximum horizontal creep). For the applied push-in test in a rigid steel box of 1. 00 x 1. 00 metre square in plan and 0. 20 meter depth, the vertical load was increased from zero to 51 kN on the CBP sample in 0 %, 4 %, 8 % and 12 % degrees of slopes. The herringbone 45 o is the best laying pattern compared to herringbone 90 o and stretcher bond to restraint the horizontal force, which the blocks contribute as a whole to the friction of the pavement, the blocks being successively locked by their rotation following their horizontal creep. The uni-pave block shape has more restraint of horizontal creep than rectangular block shape, because uni-pave block shape has gear (four-dents), while rectangular block shape has no gear (dents). The difference in deflections observed between uni-pave shape and rectangular shape are small. The change in block thickness from 60 to 100 mm significantly reduces the elastic deflection of pavement. The optimum joint width between blocks is 3 mm. For joint widths less than the optimum, the jointing sand was unable to enter between blocks. The relationship between push-in force with block displacement on the varying loose thicknesses of 30, 50, and 70 mm bedding sand, shows that the deflections of pavement increase with increase in loose thickness of bedding sand. The higher the loose bedding sand thickness, the more the deflection will be. The effect of the degree of slope on concrete block pavements on sloping road section area is significant with friction between blocks and thrusting action between adjacent blocks at hinging points is more effective with thicker blocks. Thus, deflections are much less for thicker blocks with increasing degree of the slope. The spacing of <b>anchor</b> <b>beam</b> is increase with decreasing joint width, degree of slope and bedding sand thickness.

40|$|In {{response}} to a perturbation, the stiffness or mass of a MEMS resonator can change and previous research has utilised the resonant frequency shift to characterise the perturbation, be it strain or acceleration altering the resonator stiffness or the attachment of a biological element altering the resonator mass. More recently, {{research has focused on}} developing MEMS resonator sensors based on the mode-localisation effect, which is the name given to the effect where the mode shapes of an electrostatically coupled system are seen to 'localise' around one of the resonators when the stiffness or mass of one changes. By measuring the change in the mode shape of a coupled system, it is possible to achieve a greater sensitivity to a perturbation than by simply measuring the change in resonant frequency of a one degree-of-freedom system. Building on the previously reported work, the design, fabrication and characterisation of various designs and dimensions of coupled MEMS resonator devices has been performed, with the aim of experimentally determining the influence of the design and dimensions on the device sensitivity. A high-yield dicing-free silicon-on-insulator based process has been used to fabricate electrostatically-coupled MEMS resonator pairs with a thickness of 50 μm. For a design consisting of two 410 μm long rectangular clamped-clamped beams, the sensitivity of the amplitude ratio at the in-phase mode shape has been increased up to 12 times by increasing the beam width from 10 μm to 20 μm. A second design, featuring a larger 310 x 60 μm rectangular block at the centre of the resonator, has shown a sensitivity up to 3. 26 times greater than for the clamped-clamped beams and up to 9 times greater than the state-of-art, with reducing the <b>anchor</b> <b>beam</b> lengths down to 55 μm proving to be critical. Other devices fabricated with an alternative SOI-based process showed stiffness sensitivity up to 46 times greater than the state-of-the-art, but with the drawback that the fabrication process is of a much lower yield. Finally, through removal of up to 3. 39 ng of material with a focused ion beam, mass sensing has been demonstrated with a coupled-resonator device, with a 5. 4 times greater amplitude ratio response compared to the best value in the literature...|$|E
40|$|If {{a pair of}} MEMS {{resonators}} are electrostatically coupled together, {{the vibration}} amplitude ratios at the resonant frequencies of the resulting coupled system are sensitive to stiffness perturbation. An imbalance between the two resonators causes the confinement of vibration energy when the system is resonating, an effect known as mode-localization. The degree of localization can be determined by extracting the amplitude ratio of the resonators through capacitive transduction. In this paper, we have fabricated MEMS devices, using a dicing-free silicon-on-insulator process, consisting of pairs of closely spaced microresonators. Each resonator consists of a clamped-clamped beam with a wider section in the middle, which is {{the location of the}} electrostatic coupling, instituted through the DC biasing of the resonators. Several devices have been fabricated, with the length of the <b>anchor</b> <b>beams</b> being varied, which influences the frequency of resonance.

This paper presents a study on the effectiveness of using steel plates and bolts as end-anchors to address these problems. Four steel I-beams were tested to failure. The first specimen was not strengthened and was used as the control beam. The second beam was strengthened with a CFRP plate without any end-anchoring.

The beams were tested under four point loads and loaded incrementally while the deflection and strain readings on the critical parts of the beams were recorded. For the numerical study, full three dimensional (3 D) simulation and nonlinear static analysis was carried out using ANSYS software.

The flexurally strengthened beams were further shear strengthened using L-shaped intermediate anchors based on proposed and conventional methods.

One of the main interest in designing end anchors is to determine the minimum or optimal length of end anchors for a given thickness and height of the end anchor. This paper presents experimental and numerical studies in determining those optimum lengths for steel plate and carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminate flexurally strengthened r. c. beams. In the experimental programme, seven r. c. beams were cast. One beam was tested in the un-strengthened condition to act as the control beam. Three beams were strengthened with steel plates and another three beams were strengthened with CFRP laminates. From each group of the strengthened beams, one beam was strengthened without any end anchor, one was end anchored using the optimum anchorage length and the last one was end anchored using an arbitrarily 200 mm anchorage length. The optimum length for the end anchor used in this study was derived from analyzing the interfacial stress diagram of the strengthened beams and was found to be approximately 100 mm. The beams were also modelled using FEM (LUSAS). The results indicate that the optimized 100 mm anchorage length plates were able to prevent premature plate end debonding failure of steel plate and CFRP laminate strengthened beams satisfactorily. It could also be seen from the results that <b>beams</b> with end <b>anchors</b> had a higher failure loads and had more ductile behaviour than the un-anchored strengthened beams.

The major prime mover for MEMS {{industry in the}} past has been automobiles whereas consumer electronics (E. g. iPhones and Nintendo Wii) is the most important sector for growth now. With new focus on small scale energy harvesting from ambient vibration and air flow, MEMS have definitely entered a new generation. A significant factor propelling design and manufacturing is the need for reliable and robust computational tools. The basic skeleton of MEMS still remain suspended or <b>anchored</b> <b>beams</b> and plates actuated by electrical, electrostatic, thermal, magnetic or photonic mechanisms. This dissertation describes the simulation of coupled dynamics of thin MEMS actuated electrostatically and vibrating in a fluid medium. Although, only micro-beams are addressed here, the computational structure developed here can be directly used to address other forms of actuation or medium. A fully Lagrangian approach is developed to couple the electrostatic, fluidic and mechanical problem which is then solved using Newton's method. This approach eliminates the problems arising from remeshing and computing of derivatives of integrals over changing domain shapes. The mechanical problem is solved using finite element method (FEM) whereas the fluidic and electrostatic problems are tackled using the boundary element method (BEM). Severe numerical issues arise when dealing with very thin microstruc- tures (very high aspect ratio) for the BEM problem due to nearly singular integrals. A special BEM which addresses these problems has been developed for both the electrostatic and the fluidic problem. A singularity of mathematical nature arises at the free edge for the electrostatic BEM problem when dealing with cantilevers. This problem is solved by incorporating a singular element formulation for the electrostatic BEM. The resulting solution is compared with the case of simple extrapolation for some typical performance parameters. Finally, several possible extensions of current work like adapting the algorithm for nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), computational acceleration using the fast multipole method (FMM) and quantifying uncertainty has been explained in the concluding chapter...|$|R

From the strengthened beams, one <b>beam</b> was intermediate <b>anchored</b> in the shear span to prevent premature shear failure. The anchorage lengths provided by the end and intermediate anchors were of 200 and 40 mm, respectively. The results showed that the intermediate anchors in shear span zone prevented premature shear failure. Result also showed that the strengthened <b>beams</b> with intermediate <b>anchors</b> had significant effects on failure loads, failure modes, strain characteristics, deflections and cracking patterns over the end <b>anchored</b> strengthened <b>beam...</b>|$|R
