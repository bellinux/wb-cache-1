5|$|Leroux {{was one of}} 21 {{professional}} athletes featured in ESPN's The Body Issue in 2013. She appeared semi-nude on one of eight covers for the magazine. Of the experience she said, I {{think a lot of}} females struggle with the way they look, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's a big deal to be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E
5|$|We {{really wanted}} to do {{something}} that just shows who I am. We weren't trying to make a better version of myself. It was really more about fun and being spontaneous. All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E
25|$|This song has an {{infectious}} clap that runs throughout <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to visually reference the clapping and embellish {{it as the}} unique hook of the video.|$|E

5000|$|When the American wife finally arrives {{outside that}} cat is gone, and, {{slightly}} crestfallen, {{she returns to}} the room alone. The American wife then has a (rather one-sided) conversation with her husband about the things she wants with her life, particularly how she wants to settle down (as opposed to the transient vacation life the couple has in the story): “I want to eat {{at a table with}} my own silver <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> candles. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> it to be spring <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to brush my hair out {{in front of a mirror}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> a kitty <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> some new clothes.” [...] However, her husband, George, continues to read his books, acting dismissively of what his wife “wants.” The story ends when the maid arrives with a “big tortoise-shell cat pressed tight against her and swung down against her body,” [...] which she gives to the American wife.|$|R
25|$|I didn't {{have the}} luxury - and I {{consider}} it a luxury - of being a protester because my focus was concentrated on getting information. I knew I wasn't {{going to be in}} that position for very long. I wanted to participate in gathering whatever information I could in the time I had, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to bring it all together, really to see what would happen. I needed time to work by myself.|$|E
25|$|It wasn't easy to {{find the}} YPSL in Columbia, Missouri. But I had read about it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be one. We had a very limited number of {{activities}} in Columbia, Missouri. We had an anti-Franco rally, which was a worthy cause. You could raise a question about how relevant it {{was likely to be}} in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent quite a lot of time organizing. Eventually, I regret to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I thought that was rather discouraging.|$|E
25|$|In 1911 {{the final}} {{competition}} for the decoration of the large walls of the University of Oslo Aula (assembly hall) was held between Munch and Emanuel Vigeland. The episode {{is known as the}} Aula Controversy. In 1914 Munch was finally commissioned to decorate the Aula and the work was completed in 1916. This major work in Norwegian monumental painting includes 11 paintings covering 223 m2. The Sun, History and Alma Mater are the key works in this sequence. Munch declared: “I wanted the decorations to form a complete and independent world of ideas, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> their visual expression to be both distinctively Norwegian and universally human.” In 2014 it was suggested that the Aula paintings have a value of at least 500 million kroner.|$|E

25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E

500|$|I {{started writing}} what I felt was Bat Out of Hell part 2, {{definitely}} like The Godfather part I and part 2, that's how I saw it. I {{wanted to do}} a continuation <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do an album that went even further and that was more extreme, if possible, which a lot of people felt wasn't possible but I just wanted to see if I could make a record that was even more heroic because that's what I thought of it ... Bat Out of Hell to me was ultimately very heroic though it was funny ... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do one that to me would be even more heroic and more epic and a little more operatic and passionate.|$|E

Anarky as a character—and as a broader idea—is much more radical than Ollie." ...|$|E

500|$|After unsuccessfully {{trying to}} persuade the referee to change his {{decision}} about the penalty, Fowler took it tamely and Seaman saved. However, Seaman failed {{to hold on to}} the ball and Jason McAteer scored from the rebound. Although many people believe that he deliberately took the penalty kick poorly for reasons of fair play, Fowler said at the time: [...] "As a goalscorer it's part of my job to take it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to score it. I tried to score. I never missed on purpose. It just happened, it was a bad penalty." ...|$|E

He {{attended}} and later graduated from Canyon del Oro High School in the Tucson suburb of Oro Valley, Arizona in 1969. During his high school years, he participated in football (earning all-state honors twice), basketball, wrestling, and track. He attributes his competitive nature to having an older brother, Chip Hochuli.

And I'd read some of Ted's poems in this magazine and I was very impressed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to meet him. I went to this little celebration and that's actually where we met... Then we saw {{a great deal of}} each other. Ted came back to Cambridge and suddenly we found ourselves getting married a few months later... We kept writing poems to each other. Then it just grew out of that, I guess, a feeling that we both were writing so much and having such a fine time doing it, we decided that this should keep on.|$|E
