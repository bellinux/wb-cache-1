6000|$|The {{rest of us}} {{were grouped}} at the port <b>anchor</b> <b>davit,</b> staring with no less assiduity, but with far less hope on the obscure horizon. Islands we beheld in plenty, but they were of [...] "such stuff as dreams are made on," [...] and {{vanished}} at a wink, only to appear in other places; and by and by not only islands, but refulgent and revolving lights began to stud the darkness; light-houses of the mind or of the wearied optic nerve, solemnly shining and winking as we passed. At length the mate himself despaired, scrambled on board again from his unrestful perch, and announced that we had missed our destination. He was the only man of practice in these waters, our sole pilot, shipped for that end at Tai-o-hae. If he declared we had missed Takaroa, {{it was not for}} us to quarrel with the fact, but, if we could, to explain it. We had certainly run down our southing. Our canted wake upon the sea and our somewhat drunken-looking course upon the chart both testified with no less certainty to an impetuous westward current. We {{had no choice but to}} conclude we were again set down to leeward; and the best we could do was to bring the Casco to the wind, keep a good watch, and expect morning.|$|E
25|$|A superstructure, redoubts, barbettes, turrets {{and main}} and {{secondary}} guns were assembled using wood framing, covered with cement and metal lathing. Fittings and details, such as <b>anchors,</b> torpedo nets, <b>davits,</b> railings, and {{a multitude of}} other details, gave {{the appearance of a}} functioning warship. Within the superstructure were berthing spaces, cabins, galley, and other living spaces all constructed to emulate realistic living conditions on American battleships. As a result of the attention to detail, Illinois was a faithful reproduction of a coastal battleship.|$|R
50|$|Lady Elizabeth {{is still}} intact and {{partially}} beached in Whale Bone Cove. The ship {{has been reported}} to rock back and forth during high tides from the pounding waves. Many of the ship's accessories are still attached to Lady Elizabeth including the main crank for the <b>anchor,</b> the <b>davits</b> that would hold the two lifeboats, part of the crow's nest, part of the spiral staircase, and most of her wooden decking. However, most of the ship is suffering severe rust and the keel has started to rust away leaving large holes. During high tide, the bottom of the ship is flooded. There are still sections of paint {{on the inside of the}} ship. Some of the iron rivets have rusted away causing the starboard bulkhead to spring out. In June 1984, the owner assessed the damage of Lady Elizabeth. Using original reports from the assessment made on the damage in 1913, they found the foot-long hole in the keel and reported that this was indeed the reason the ship would not stay afloat. However, if Lady Elizabeth was towed for repairs in drydock, she could possibly sail again. Unfortunately, there was no dry dock in Port Stanley in 1984.|$|R
50|$|She {{was fitted}} out for United States Navy service at Tietjen & Lang's {{shipyard}} at Hoboken, New Jersey. Work began on 16 November 1917. Gun platforms were added for two anti-aircraft guns forward and a 5"/51 caliber gun aft. The minelaying conversion {{enabled her to}} carry mines on three decks, and included six Otis elevators individually capable of transferring two mines every 20 seconds from the storage decks to the launching deck. Stern ports were cut for launching the mines and the rudder quadrant was raised to give adequate clearance. Watertight subdivision was improved by strengthening existing bulkheads and building two new bulkheads to divide the largest compartments so the ship might stay afloat if only one compartment were flooded. Quarters were enlarged to accommodate messing and berthing arrangements for a crew of about 400. The main machinery was overhauled and auxiliary machinery was added for the elevators, for heating the berthing spaces, for refrigerated food storage, for additional fresh water distilling capacity, for magazine sprinklers and galley and washroom plumbing, and enlarged electric generators for lighting and radio communications. Existing coal bunkers on the third deck were replaced with a bunker in the hold forward of the boiler room with chutes to load coal over the mines. Larger boats and heavier <b>anchors</b> required larger <b>davits</b> and <b>anchor</b> windlass, and the mines required specialized handling machinery.|$|R
