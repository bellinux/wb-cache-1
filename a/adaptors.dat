5|$|Checkpoint Proteins can be {{separated}} into four groups: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like protein kinase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-like group, two serine/threonine(S/T) kinases and their <b>adaptors.</b> Central to all DNA damage induced checkpoints responses {{is a pair}} of large protein kinases belonging to the first group of PI3K-like protein kinases-the ATM (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (Ataxia- and Rad-related) kinases, whose sequence and functions have been well conserved in evolution. All DNA damage response requires either ATM or ATR because they have the ability to bind to the chromosomes at the site of DNA damage, together with accessory proteins that are platforms on which DNA damage response components and DNA repair complexes can be assembled.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{was transferred}} to the division with which it would {{spend the rest of the}} war; the 6th Airborne Division, raised in April 1943. The squadron continued to train as an air-portable unit and participated in a number of exercises intended to familiarize it with the duties it would perform, including reconnaissance of enemy positions and performing counter-attacks against enemy infantry and armor. In mid-July an American pilot was sent to Britain to illustrate that the tank could fit inside a Hamilcar and be landed, and then on October 25 the Light Tank Squadron received a shipment of seventeen Locusts. During November the new tanks were issued to the squadron, replacing a majority of the Tetrarchs; however a small number of Tetrarchs fitted with a 3 inch (76.2 mm) infantry support howitzer, which were designated as Tetrarch 1 CS (Close Support), were retained. Several of the Locusts also were fitted with Littlejohn <b>adaptors</b> to increase the range and penetration power of their main armament, although it is not clear how many were fitted or if they were fitted at manufacture or after they reached the squadron. The squadron was expanded into the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment in December 1943, and as late as March 1944, plans were made for the regiment to be equipped with seventeen Locusts and three Tetrarchs when it took part in Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in Normandy. However, records indicate that by April the Hamilcar gliders of the regiment were being refitted to only carry Tetrarchs, and by late March the Locusts appear to have been completely replaced. This seems to have been due to mechanical and gunnery problems with the Locusts, as well as specific problems with the design of the Locust's gearbox.|$|E

40|$|Using <b>adaptor</b> grammars to {{identify}} synergies in the unsupervised acquisition of linguistic structure <b>Adaptor</b> grammars (Johnson et al., 2007 b) are a non-parametric Bayesian extension of Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) which in effect learn the probabilities of entire subtrees. In practice, {{this means that}} an <b>adaptor</b> grammar learns the structures useful for generating the training data {{as well as their}} probabilities. We present several different <b>adaptor</b> grammars that learn to segment phonemic input into words by modeling different linguistic properties of the input. One of the advantages of a grammar-based framework is that it is easy to combine grammars, and we use this ability to compare models that capture different kinds of linguistic structure. We show that incorporating both unsupervised syllabification and collocation-finding into the <b>adaptor</b> grammar significantly improves unsupervised word-segmentation accuracy over that achieved by <b>adaptor</b> grammars that model only one of these linguistic phenomena. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} bachelor´s thesis was {{to design}} an <b>adaptor</b> for imaging the eye diagram of digital video signals in the basic zone. <b>Adaptor</b> is a device by which we can {{illustrate}} the signal distortion resulting from the passage through the transmission channel, using the XY displeying. This <b>adaptor</b> should be designed with the symbol timing recovery. This means that the <b>adaptor</b> has been divided into two parts. Part of the broadcast, which consists of a units generator timing signal, generator block and pseudorandom sequences. These blocks of me created a 127 -bit sequence with different frequencies (2 MHz, 4 MHz, 8 MHz and 16 MHz). In {{the evaluation of the}} <b>adaptor,</b> which is composed of symbol timing recovery, frequency dividers, low pass filter and all-pass network for phase synchronization and adjustment signal amplifiers, the signal is divided into two branches.

The individual blocks were designed in detail and implementation schemes were drawn up for both of the adapter. From these themes, I then proposed a DPS for each of the <b>adaptor.</b> They were blocks of broadcast <b>adaptor,</b> evaluation of the <b>adaptor,</b> the blocks of resources and subpanel for two main blocks.

25|$|Multisocket <b>adaptors</b> {{allow the}} {{connection}} {{of two or more}} plugs to a simple socket. They are manufactured in various configurations, depending on the country and the region in which they are used, with various ratings. In Europe for example, they are called double or triple <b>adaptors,</b> and transform a one socket into a multiple socket. This has the advantage of connecting more than one electrical consumer item to one single socket and is mainly used for low power devices (TV sets, table lamps, computers, etc.). They are usually rated at 6A 250V, 10A 250V, or 16A 250V, however this is the general rating of the adaptor (for example, if we have an adaptor for four sockets and it is marked 16A 250V, this means that the adaptor should not be loaded more than 16A, whether one, two, three or all sockets are used. Some people overload them, thus leading to accidents). In some countries these <b>adaptors</b> are banned and are not available in shops, as they may lead to fires due to overloading them. In the past, these <b>adaptors</b> were made from ceramic, Bakelite or other fire resistant plastics, but nowadays they are made from various available plastics that can be safely used in electrical devices (such as PA6, PVC, PP). Some low quality <b>adaptors</b> are made from plastics not approved for electrical use (such as PS or non fire resistant ABS), and these may cause fires in the case of overheating due to overloading or bad contacts.|$|E
