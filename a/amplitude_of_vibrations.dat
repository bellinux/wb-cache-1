50|$|Further {{research}} into crackling noise {{was done in}} the late 1940s by Charles Francis Richter and Beno Gutenberg who examined earthquakes analytically. Before the invention of the well-known Richter scale, the Mercalli intensity scale was used; this is a subjective measurement of how damaging an earthquake was to property, i.e. II would be small vibrations and objects moving, while XII would be wide spread destruction of all buildings. The Richter scale is a logarithmic scale which measures the energy and <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibrations</b> dissipated from the epicentre of the earthquake, i.e. a 7.0 earthquake is 10 times more powerful than a 6.0 earthquake. Together with Gutenberg, they went on to discover the Gutenberg-Richter law which is a probability distribution relationship between the magnitude of an earthquake and its probability of occurrence. It states that small earthquakes happen much more frequently and larger earthquakes occur very rarely.|$|E
50|$|Mucous {{retention}} cysts {{are most}} commonly seen in individuals that endure high vocal stress {{in their daily}} lives, while epidermoid cysts are usually congenital or second to vocal trauma (see lead section {{for more information on}} different types of cysts). The two types of vocal fold cysts can be differentiated from other vocal fold growths in several ways. Both types show decreased <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibrations</b> and reduced or absent mucosal wave. Mucous retention cysts show a translucent mass of mucous usually below the free margin of the glottis, while epidermoid cysts are yellow masses under the first epithelial layer of the vocal folds. Epidermoid cysts generally appear in the superior and medial regions of the midmusculomembranous region of the folds, as opposed to mucous cysts appearing in the inferior region. Vocal fold cysts are differentiated from other vocal fold masses in that they are unilateral and subepithelial.|$|E

The experimental analysis also seeks to take into account a variety of factors influencing the coefficient of friction such as normal load and surface roughness. An in-house pin-on-disc apparatus was constructed with a spindle speed control and applied forced-feedback to perform the tests. The response surface methodology is utilized to investigate the effects of the factors and their cross influence on the coefficient of friction for the Steel C 1020 and Aluminum 7079. The analysis of variance is done on the experimental data to evaluate the statistical significance of the model. The response equation for the coefficient of friction of Steel C 1020 and Aluminum 7079 were determined. The ranges <b>of</b> frequency and <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> were 120 – 600 Hz and 15 – 225 µm, respectively.
