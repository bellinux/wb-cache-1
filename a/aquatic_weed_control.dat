Experiments were carried out in a 3 block split plot design with 6 treatments and once untreated control at each site. In one site the reeds were growing in a terrestrial environment out of the water but along a north facing bank, at another site the reeds were growing in shallow water at the toe of the bank and up the bank, and at the third site all the treated reed were growing in shallow water approximately 30 – 40 cm deep. Control appeared to be dose dependent at the two sites with some terrestrial influence, but complete control was achieved at all dose rates when reeds were growing in water. Measurements of regrowth were made in June and October one year after treatment. The June observations showed good control, even at the lower doses, but the October measurements showed regrowth in the plots treated with low dose rates. Most regrowth was from seedling recruitment as the plants observed had no flowers.
