His body of work helps to understand [...] "the significant contributions by marginalized artists who successfully negotiated the terrain of the mainstream art world." [...] Lone Wolf died in St. Mary's hospital in Tucson, Arizona, on February 9, 1970. He was cremated, and his ashes were interred near the grave of his maternal uncle Last Rider in Montana. He was buried on June 19, 1970, in an Indian ceremony which included four willow wands topped by eagle feathers placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grave. Paul Dyke, his adopted son, lowered the urn into the earth, and Lone Wolf's widow, Naomi, cast the first spade of earth into the grave. Afterwards, Naomi gave the eagle feathers to friends as remembrances. At some point during the next year, Naomi, despondent over Lone Wolf's death, committed suicide, using Lone Wolf's old revolver. Two years after his death, his story was highlighted, along with pictures of his paintings and sculptures, in the first issue of the 1972 edition of Montana The Magazine of Western History. The article was written by Paul Dyke.|$|E
