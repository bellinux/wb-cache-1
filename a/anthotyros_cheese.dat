40|$|Anthotyros {{is a type}} of low {{fat cheese}} {{produced}} from a mixture of sheep and goat milk. <b>Anthotyros</b> <b>cheese</b> in Crete is produced from the whey of hard cheese such as kefalotyri and graviera. Anthotyros is a cheese which comes from the myzithra cheese (whey) dehydration. The dehydrated anthotyros' physicochemical properties are moisture content of 35 %, fat content in dry matter of 55 % and low concentration of salt. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify which of the three gas compositions applied; MAP(1) : 40 % CO 2, 55 % N- 2, 5 % O- 2, MAP(2) : 60 % CO 2, 40 % N- 2 and MAP(3) : 50 % CO 2, 50 % N- 2 can lead to greater shelf life prolongation of anthotyros. The control samples were packaged in air. All cheese samples were kept under refrigeration (4 +/- 0. 5 degrees C) for 55 days. The statistical analysis of organoleptic characteristics was carried out by using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by means of JMP 5. 0. 1. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
