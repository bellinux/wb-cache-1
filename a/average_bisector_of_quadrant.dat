30|$|A {{goal for}} a task {{could be the}} {{construction}} of a conjecture. That is the case in a lesson about the angle bisectors problem, which we used to inquire on teachers’ perceptions of students. The goal of the task was for students to make a conjecture about the angle <b>bisectors</b> <b>of</b> a quadrilateral: After reminding students what happens with angle <b>bisectors</b> <b>of</b> a triangle, the teacher asks ‘what can one say about the angle <b>bisectors</b> <b>of</b> a quadrilateral’. In the angle bisectors problem, operations could include the drawing of quadrilaterals and their angle bisectors and observing whether the angle <b>bisectors</b> <b>of</b> those quadrilaterals meet at a point or make some other configuration. The resources could include the diagrams, prior knowledge about the definition <b>of</b> angle <b>bisector,</b> knowledge <b>of</b> the fact that angle <b>bisectors</b> <b>of</b> a triangle meet at a point, or time to work independently on the task.|$|R

We show that <b>bisectors</b> <b>of</b> weakly linearly separable sets in E d share many properties with separating lines. Among these, the <b>bisector</b> <b>of</b> a restricted class of linearly separated sets is a homeomorphic image of the linear separator. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions {{for the existence of}} a particular continuous map from a portion of any linear separator to the bisector...|$|R
