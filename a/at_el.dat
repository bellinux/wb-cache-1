5|$|On 22 April Wiggin and his brigade headquarters, {{with one}} {{squadron}} and one troop of Worcestershire Hussars, had arrived <b>at</b> Bir <b>el</b> Hamisah from Katia. Wiggin moved there {{in response to}} an intelligence report that an Ottoman force was <b>at</b> Bir <b>el</b> Mageibra some distance to the south and, with the agreement of his commander H. A.

5|$|In May, before Cascade {{had become}} fully operational, Rommel {{defeated}} the British Army in Libya. Auchinleck rallied his forces <b>at</b> <b>El</b> Alamein and asked Clarke to draft plans for delaying the Axis advance, giving the Allies time to withdraw. Operation Sentinel {{was designed to}} convince Rommel, using camouflage, fakery and radio deception, that substantial British armour sat {{between him and the}} retreating Eighth Army. In spite of his success <b>at</b> <b>El</b> Alamein Auchinleck was replaced by Harold Alexander on , Clarke's third commander in under two years. Bernard Montgomery was handed control of the Eighth Army and instructed to push Rommel back. Montgomery knew Clarke, having taught him infantry tactics at the Staff College in 1931, and instructed him to prepare deception plans for the Second Battle of El Alamein. The plan involved major camouflage activity, Operation Bertram, radio deception, Operation Canwell and a disinformation campaign, Operation Treatment. On 9 September Clarke was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). The citation recognised his efforts in setting up A-Force, but referred to its less clandestine MI9 escape and evasion work.|$|E
5|$|Later, 18 B-17s {{from the}} 97th Bomb Group bombed Axis airfields <b>at</b> <b>El</b> Aounina. Two Me 323s, two Ju 52s and five Italian {{transports}} were destroyed. A second mission was flown to Sid Ahmed. Both raids were flown with Spitfire escorts. Only a few German fighters intercepted, without success. The bombers claimed one German fighter destroyed.|$|E
5|$|On 18 November, while Allenby {{was at the}} British XXI Corps {{headquarters}} <b>at</b> <b>El</b> Kastine, {{the decision}} was made to closely follow the Ottoman Seventh Army into the Judean Hills.

5|$|On {{arrival in}} Palestine, the 2/48th Battalion encamped <b>at</b> <b>El</b> Kantara and began {{training}} in desert warfare. For relaxation, the battalion set up athletic events, and Derrick became {{well known for}} often winning cross-country races—and for organising {{a book on the}} outcomes. In March 1941, the unit went by train and truck to Alexandria, Egypt, then along the North African coast to Cyrenaica, in Libya, to join the 9th Australian Division.|$|E
5|$|On the {{one hand}} he didn't commit war crimes {{that we know of}} and ordered a retreat <b>at</b> <b>El</b> Alamein despite Hitler's order.

5|$|The first {{shock of}} the {{earthquake}} occurred at 0:16 GMT and was followed by several strong aftershocks. The quake was most widely felt in the Chinandega and León departments of Nicaragua, though it was also felt elsewhere in Nicaragua <b>at</b> <b>El</b> Crucero, Managua and San Marcos and at San José in Costa Rica. It was the strongest seismic event to hit Nicaragua since the earthquake of 1972.|$|E
25|$|While the {{divisions}} were in reserve <b>at</b> Abasan <b>el</b> Kebir, training {{was conducted in}} musketry, tactical schemes, staff rides, practice concentrations, anti–gas methods, the handling and sending of messages by carrier pigeons, and getting quickly ready to move out on operations. Other activities carried on while <b>at</b> Abasan <b>el</b> Kebir, included cricket matches and, on 31 August, a boxing competition.

5|$|After {{helping to}} secure victory <b>at</b> <b>El</b> Alamein the 9th Division moved to Gaza in Palestine on 3 December. Since the {{previous}} October, the Australian government {{had sought to}} bring the division back to Australia {{in order to use}} it against the Japanese in the Pacific, along with the 6th and 7th Divisions which had been withdrawn the year before, and on 15 December the British prime minister, Winston Churchill, had finally agreed to provide the necessary shipping. Following a divisional parade at Gaza, the 2/48th Battalion embarked upon the troopship Nieuw Amsterdam on 24 January 1943.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, the {{captured}} German panzerarmee general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery {{that he had}} believed the Allies {{had at least one}} more armoured division than they did, and that the attack would be in the south. Rommel's stand-in, general Georg Stumme, thought the attack would not begin for several weeks. Bertram had thus succeeded in all its objectives. Announcing the victory <b>at</b> <b>El</b> Alamein in the House of Commons, Winston Churchill praised the camouflage operation.|$|E
