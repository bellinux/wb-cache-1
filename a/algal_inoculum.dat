40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2016. Major: Bioproducts/Biosystems Science Engineering and Management. Advisor: Roger Ruan. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 130 pages. Microalgae have great potential to replace current crop feedstocks for biofuel production. However, the algal biofuel industry {{is still far}} from being economically available. This dissertation {{was inspired by the}} idea of coupling algae-based biofuel generation and municipal wastewater treatment, and developing a biofuel production system that can recycle its own wastes, and thus significantly improve its environmental friendliness and economic viability. The objectives of this study are to fully utilize wastewater and by-products from biodiesel production process to grow mixotrophic algae strains for simultaneous biomass accumulation, biodiesel production and waste stream nutrient removal. The previous study has shown that Chlorella vulgaris grew well on centrate wastewater, which is the best among all municipal wastewater streams for both algae yield and wastewater nutrient removal. For the large scale algal biomass production, wastewater-borne bacteria are expected to influence the algal biomass accumulation. Therefore, different levels of initial <b>algal</b> <b>inoculums</b> were tested to determine the appropriate algae inoculation levels that would allow algae to compete favorably with the wastewater-borne bacteria and dominate the culture. The effect of algae and wastewater-borne bacteria interaction on the algal biomass accumulation and wastewater nutrients removal were studied. Raw and autoclaved centrate was used as the media for algae growth. The results showed that algae can promote bacterial growth, and the presence of bacteria had a significant influence on algal growth pattern, suggesting symbiotic relationship between algae and bacteria at the initial stage of algae cultivation. Moreover, bacteria could increase the algal growth rate and nutrients removal rate at the initial stage of the cultivation. The maximum algal biomass of 2. 01 g/L with 0. 1 g/L initial <b>algal</b> <b>inoculums</b> concentration can be obtained during algae cultivation in raw centrate medium. The bacteria community profiles tested during cultivation period showed the abundant and diverse microbial community in the samples. Ten phyla and 37 genera were identified. Phylum Bacteroidetes dominate the culture in the centrate wastewater while genus Prevotella was most abundant accounting for 87. 1 % of the total sequences. At the end of cultivation, microbial community was dominated by phylum Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. Four bacteria genus, Acinetobacter, Bacteroidales_norank, Megasphaera, and S 24 - 7 _norank, may have a strong influence on algal growth. Lipid-extracted microalgal biomass residues (LMBRs) are the leftover biomass from algae-based biodiesel production. The enzymatic hydrolysates of this waste resource, which contain mainly proteins and carbohydrates, were recycled and used as nutritional sources for microalgal cultivation and lipid production. Effect of temperature and substrate concentration on algae growth and lipid production using hydrolyzed LMBRs were studied. The results showed that C. vulgaris could grow mixotrophically {{in a wide range of}} temperatures (20 ∼ 35 °C). The optimal temperature for cell growth and lipid accumulation of the mixotrophic cultivation of C. vulgaris was between 25 and 30 °C. The neutral lipids of the algal culture at 25 °C accounted for as much as 82 % of the total lipid content in the microalga at culture Day 8. Fatty acid composition analysis showed that the increase of saturated fatty acids was proportional to the increase in cultivation temperature. The maximum biomass concentration of 4. 83 g/L and the maximum lipid productivity of 164 mg/L/day were obtained at an initial total LMBRs hydrolyzed sugar concentration of 10 g/L and an initial total concentration of LMBRs hydrolyzed amino acids of 1. 0 g/L but decreased at lower and higher substrate concentrations. Waste glycerol generated from biodiesel production using wastewater scum as oil feedstock was recycled and added into wastewater to provide carbon source, support microalgal lipid production, and nutrient removal of wastewater, and further increased the economic viability of scum-based biodiesel production. Effect of crude glycerol and pretreated glycerol concentration and initial pH on algae growth and lipid production of C. vulgaris were tested. The results showed that nutrient removal was improved and lipid production of C. vulgaris was enhanced with the addition of waste glycerol into the wastewater to improve its C/N ratio. The optimal concentration of pretreated glycerol for C. vulgaris cultivation was 10 g L- 1 to achieve the biomass concentration of 2. 92 g L- 1 and lipid productivity of 163 mg L- 1 d- 1, and the removal of 100 % ammonia and 95 % of total nitrogen. Alkaline conditions promoted cell growth and lipid accumulation of C. vulgaris and simultaneously stimulated nutrient removal...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} mechanisms enabling {{persistence of}} the introduced Asian kelp Undaria pinnatifida on the sea urchin (Heliocidaris erythrogramma) 'barrens' {{on the east coast}} of Tasmania. Development of dense stands of U. pinnatifida requires disturbance to reduce the cover of native algae. Observations of U. pinnatifida occurring abundantly on sea urchin barrens suggests that disturbance in the form of grazing by sea urchins prevents recovery of native canopy-forming species, allowing dense stands of U. pinnatifida to persist. We examined this hypothesis over a 30 mo period in a manipulative experiment in which the response of native algae and U. pinnatifida was examined in treatments comprising all possible combinations of +/- urchins, +/- U. pinnatifida and +/- enhanced native <b>algal</b> spore <b>inoculum.</b> The results demonstrated that the sea urchin H. erythrogramma can {{have a significant impact on}} U. pinnatifida abundance. The response was most dramatic in the 2001 sporophyte growth season, when sea urchins destructively grazed U. pinnatifida sporophytes in experimental plots on the urchin barren. In other years, when there was higher recruitment of U. pinnatifida sporophytes, urchins reduced sporophyte abundance but did not prevent development of a U. pinnatifida canopy. Removal of sea urchins resulted in a slow increase in cover of understorey red algae, but only limited recovery of native canopy-forming species. In treatments where both sea urchins and U. pinnatifida were removed, cover of canopy-forming species did not exceed 6...|$|R
30|$|The algal strain {{was first}} {{grown in the}} round bottom flask. To do so, the <b>algal</b> <b>inoculum</b> was {{prepared}} by transferring a loop full of algal culture aseptically from the nutrient agar plates supplied by Department of Biotechnology of Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, to the round bottom flask consisting of growth medium (sterilized at 121  °C temperature, 15 psi pressure for at least 15  min), incubated at 28  °C for 7 days in a thermostatically controlled environmental chamber (PGC– 292, plant growth chamber, Ambala, India). The pH of the growth medium was adjusted to 9.0 with 1  N HCl and 1  N NaOH before inoculation. Then, the microalgal strain was grown on a petri plates consisting of agar medium containing the nutrient components (Tables  1 and 2) and agar (12.0  g/L). The microalgae were inoculated from the plates on another fresh agar plate after the incubation of cultures at 28  °C for 7 days in agar plates and stored at 4  °C till required for further studies.|$|E
40|$|The use of microalgae as live food to a {{wide variety}} of organisms is one of the most {{important}} aspects in aquaculture. Several commercial formulations have been available in the marine aquarium market in order to prepare artificial sea water (ASW). The present study accounted microalgae Chaetoceros calcitrans performance cultured using different ASW in comparison to natural seawater(NSW). it was carried out using red Sea, Coralife and oceanic, three different ASW brands and NSW as control. nonaerated cultures were grew in 400 mL with Conwy culture medium with five replicates each under defined conditions. All cultures began with an <b>algal</b> <b>inoculum</b> of 208. 000 cells/mL. a 5 -mL aliquot was removed daily from each culture for cells counts. data obtained using polynomial regression test demonstrated that all ASW brands reached higher algal density rates than the one with NSW, though the three ASW brands were significantly heterogeneous. C. calcitrans raised with oceanic and red Sea brands showed similar growth rates and both were higher than Coralife brand. the results suggest that all three ASW brands studied can be used in the culture of this microalgae specie...|$|E

40|$|The role {{of algae}} in the persistence, transformation, and {{bioremediation}} of two endocrine disrupting chemicals, α-endosulfan (a cyclodiene insecticide) and its oxidation product endosulfan sulfate, in soil (incubated under light or in darkness) and a liquid medium was examined. Incubation of soil under light dramatically decreased {{the persistence of}} α-endosulfan and enhanced its transformation to endosulfan sulfate, over that of dark-incubated soil samples, under both nonflooded and flooded conditions. This enhanced degradation of soil-applied α-endosulfan was associated with profuse growth of indigenous phototrophic organisms such as algae in soil incubated under light. Inoculation of soil with green algae, Chlorococcum sp. or Scenedesmus sp., further enhanced the degradation of α-endosulfan. The role of algae in α-endosulfan degradation was convincingly demonstrated when these algae degraded α-endosulfan to endosulfan sulfate, the major metabolite, and endosulfan ether, a minor metabolite, in a defined liquid medium. When a high density of the <b>algal</b> <b>inoculum</b> was used, both metabolites appeared to undergo further degradation as evident from their accumulation only in small amounts {{and the appearance of}} an endosulfan-derived aldehyde. Interestingly, β-endosulfan was detected during degradation of α-endosulfan by high density algal cultures. These algae were also capable of degrading endosulfan sulfate but to a lesser extent than α-endosulfan. Evidence suggested that both α-endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate were immediately sorbed by the algae from the medium, which then effected their degradation. Biosorption, coupled with their biotransformation ability, especially at a high inoculum density, makes algae effective candidates for remediation of α-endosulfan-polluted environments. N.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{various factors}} controlling algal nitrogen fixation and nitrogen release in temperate agricultural soils. New apparatus for investigating nitrogenase activity on uniform soil grown algal crusts {{and for the}} in situ estimation of nitrogen fixation {{in the field is}} described. The effects of oxygen concentration and temperature on acetylene reduction by soil grown cultures of Nostoc ellipsosporum in the light and in the dark suggest that ATP generated by oxidative phosphorylation contributes to fixation even in the light. The oxygen concentration giving optimum nitrogenase activity depends on the intensity of illumination, largely because of the continuing contribution from dark fixation. The oxygen dependant acetylene reduction continued throughout the night in the field at 20 % of the midday rate. This proportion is dependant on daytime light intensity and day/night temperature drop. The release of nitrogenous compounds by soil and sand grown cultures of N. ellipsosporum was investigated in the laboratory. Algal cultures growing on sand released only 2 % of the total nitrogen compared with 10 % released by liquid cultures. Freezing to below - 3 °C, drying to less than 4 % moisture or pathogenic infection all cause extensive cellular lysis with a concomitant loss of nitrogenase activity, followed, after several days, by a surge in ammonia concentration. The recovery of nitrogenase activity after re-wetting was investigated in the field after a period of dry weather. All samples achieved a steady rate of nitrogenase activity after 400 minutes irrespective of the magnitude of recovery. Nitrogenase activity in the field was monitored at weekly intervals using an in situ technique over a two year period on Broadbalk, one of the Rothamsted classic plots sown to winter wheat. The seasonal fixation rates varied from 1. 4 to 28 Kg/ha depending on the fertilizer and herbicide treatment. The greatest seasonal fixation was given bynon-herbicide plots receiving 48 Kg N/ha of applied nitrogen. The effect of various species of <b>algal</b> <b>inoculum</b> was investigated on 60 plots sown to winter wheat with and without irrigation and added nitrogen. A significant increase in fixation was produced and the most effective treatment was a liquid application of N. ellipsosporum. Both the N. punctiforme and Anabaena cylindrica were more effective when applied as dried sand cultures. The most important single factor limiting algal development in field experiments was soil moisture. <p...|$|E
