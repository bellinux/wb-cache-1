The dog is shot and the upset Mistress, who knew it was not really rabid, goes home. The next day, the town constable comes by boat to the Place to execute Lad under the notion that he is now rabid. The Master argues that the other dog was not rabid and refuses to allow Lad to be shot, {{ordering}} the officer off his property. As the man is leaving, his boat overturns. Unable to swim, he is in danger of drowning until Lad jumps in and brings him back to shore. The grateful officer states that he killed the dog he came to kill and Lad only looks <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> him.|$|E

Marie-Josée Croze was the obvious choice for Mademoiselle Lise Lundi. Gatlif had envisioned Lundi as being like a [...] "Hitchcock character: fragile, mysterious and strong".|$|E

[...] On her side, Jorja Fox {{has said that}} [...] "The story of Sara and Grissom is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> a fable.

500|$|To be honest, {{one of the}} hesitations I had {{in taking}} on the movie {{is that it was}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> writing about the Beatles—that {{there are so many people}} out there who know so much about him and who revere him that I just saw a {{minefield}} of disappointment.

500|$|However, Roger Ebert {{argued the}} film was a [...] "glum, lackluster movie in which even the big effects {{sequences}} seem dutiful instead of exhilarating." [...] He also felt that [...] "Brandon Routh lacks charisma as Superman", surmising that he [...] "may have been cast because he looks <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> Reeve". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that Warner Bros. should have rebooted the series {{along the lines of}} Batman Begins. He also felt Bosworth, at 22 years old, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154-minute-long film".|$|E

500|$|Clifford was {{irritated by}} being placed within a genre by critics, stating that Seefeel [...] "weren't {{trying to fit}} into any one of their scenes and it felt <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> we were almost having {{convention}} thrust upon us when that was the very thing we were reacting against." [...] AllMusic compared the songs to ambient music by the Aphex Twin, while Exclaim! noted that [...] "Quique follows a similar path as Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient work but with structures that a more rock-based band like Chapterhouse dreamed of matching." [...] The members of Seefeel were fans of Aphex Twin and said after playing shows with him and Autechre that they felt [...] "more affinity with them {{than many of the}} bands we'd met – Robin Guthrie and the Cocteau Twins excepted!" ...|$|E
500|$|The theme song, [...] "Rain", {{was written}} and {{composed}} by Senri Oe, and was originally a popular Japanese song in 1988. Shinkai enjoyed listening to Oe's song regularly while attending university, and since {{one of the}} film's themes was rain, {{it was the first}} song that came to mind while he worked on the production. He particularly liked the song because its lyrics reflected daily life, much like the film. The song was remade for the film in 2013, and sung by Motohiro Hata. Shinkai met Hata on several occasions and noted a similarity between Hata's passion as an artisan and that of the character Takao. Shinkai also felt that Hata's voice was perfect because to him it carried an [...] "underlying loneliness" [...] and [...] "sounded <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> an anxious young man".|$|E
500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was as if someone had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> The Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster. They tell you it's a kids' book, but take my word for it, no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B, praising the cinematic {{quality of the}} first two segments while concluding that the third was the poorest. He was impressed by how the Kubrick references in the second segment used originality rather than being a [...] "perfunctory checklist", and how the director's [...] "ow" [...] at the end had [...] "comic aplomb". Writing for the New York Daily News, Don Kaplan gave the episode four stars out of five, singling the third segment out as the best, and deeming the Kubrick homage [...] "smart and silly". A more mixed review came from Alex Strachan on Postmedia News' Canada.com, who found the second segment to be the best and the other two to be average, although he admitted that the Kubrick references were [...] "occasionally a little too inside or self-indulgent for their own good". He concluded that [...] "there’s something in Treehouse of Horror XXV for everyone. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> a Halloween bag of candy".|$|E
500|$|... "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" [...] {{was written}} by Alejandro Sanz for his album El Tren de los Momentos (2006). He also handled the song's {{production}} together with Lulo Pérez. Shakira, {{a close friend of}} Sanz, was the one who approached him in order to sing on his album, asking of him to make sure that she sounds [...] "nothing like she does on her own". [...] "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" [...] marks the second time Sanz and Shakira collaborated after [...] "La Tortura", included on the latter's Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 (2005). Sanz stated, [...] "I hadn't dared ask her if she wanted to do something with me, because it was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like,</b> 'I sing with you, now sing with me'. Plus, we didn't want it to be 'La Tortura 2' because we're very considerate of each other. She's the one who came and said, 'Hey, I want to sing'." [...] He concluded the interview by saying that with the collaborations, he managed to expand his artistry by experimenting with new styles.|$|E
500|$|... "Bitch I'm Madonna" [...] has {{similarities}} to DJ Snake and Lil Jon's [...] "Turn Down for What" [...] (2013) with Madonna's vocals reminiscent of singer Miley Cyrus' autotuned rapping. The song has a tearing sound alongside the [...] "bleepy electro" [...] and [...] "churning" [...] dubstep composition. It {{begins with the}} sound of acoustic guitar reminiscent of Avicii's single [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] (2012), as Madonna coos in the background, [...] "You're gonna love this", but quickly transitions into what critic Sasha Geffen calls [...] "past stadium-filling EDM" [...] and into [...] "a genre that more commonly fills the headphones of kids surfing obscure music blogs late at night. It sounds <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> vaporwave". The track deviates from a traditional song structure and hook, instead featuring harsh cuts, synths and Madonna singing in a nasal tone. Minaj raps in the track, asking everybody to [...] "go hard or go home", while Madonna shouts lyrics like, [...] "I just wanna have fun tonight, I wanna blow up this house tonight", [...] "alternating between pitch-shifted shrieks of 'Who do you think you are??' and the sing-songy title taunt." [...] Regarding her profuse usage of the word [...] "bitch" [...] in the song (along with another song [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] from Rebel Heart), Madonna defended her decision to Billboard, saying: ...|$|E

500|$|Chris Williams of Billboard said [...] "with a vocal assist from Ne-Yo and {{a clever}} guest rap by Kanye West, it appears Hilson {{is intent on}} a {{knockout}} punch of her own." [...] Dan Nishimoto of Prefix Magazine said the song {{was one of the}} better radio-friendly tracks on the album. Melinda Newman of HitFix said that [...] "the mid-tempo track is undeniably catchy and will embed itself within your brain after only a few listens." [...] Sophie Bruce of BBC Music positively received the song, calling it the album's [...] "biggest potential hit." [...] Although Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars, complimenting production by Danja, and saying that the song sounded like a more obvious hit than [...] "Return the Favor", he complained that [...] "getting two R A-listers to appear on your track should be a real coup, but not when one's got a more distinctive voice than you and the other steals the show with some typically ballsy rapping." [...] Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters criticized the repetitive hook, stating [...] "Hook-wise, it’s <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> listening to an album of kids chanting while playing double-dutch." [...] He also said that Hilson's vocals [...] "show promise but fail to distinguish the Hilson brand from the crowd." ...|$|E
500|$|Day of the Tentacle was a {{moderate}} commercial success; according to Schafer, it sold around 80,000 copies upon release. The game was critically acclaimed. Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World wrote in September 1993, [...] "Calling Day of the Tentacle {{a sequel to}} Maniac Mansion [...] is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> calling the space shuttle a sequel to the slingshot". He enjoyed the game's humor and interface, and praised the designers for removing [...] "dead end" [...] scenarios and player character death. Ardai lauded the voice acting, writing that it [...] "would have done the late Mel Blanc proud", and compared the game's humor, animation, and camera angles to [...] "Looney Toons [...] gems from the 40's and 50's". He concluded, [...] "I expect that this game will keep entertaining people {{for quite some time}} to come". In April 1994 the magazine said of the CD version that Sanders's Bernard was among [...] "many other inspired performances", concluding that [...] "Chuck Jones would be proud". Sandy Petersen of Dragon stated that its graphics [...] "are in a stupendous cartoony style", while praising its humor and describing its sound and music as [...] "excellent". Although the reviewer considered it [...] "one of the best" [...] graphic adventure games, he noted that, like LucasArts' earlier Loom, it was extremely short; he wrote that he [...] "felt cheated somehow when I finished the game". He ended the review, [...] "Go, Lucasfilm! Do this again, but do make the next game longer!".|$|E
500|$|Burton {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that he enjoyed the plot twist, and compared it to Jason Morgan being Monica Quartermaine's (Leslie Charleson) son on General Hospital. He said that he felt a connection while working with Scott, stating: [...] "There is vulnerability there between us, and it’s not on purpose. It’s just something that is there. It was actually kind of there before it happened that we were on-screen mother and son." [...] In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: [...] "Nikki thinks she has come up with a good way of having everyone informed in the kindest way possible. If it were me, I would think, [...] "I can only go through this once. It's too emotional! Let's sit everybody down at the same time and get it over with." [...] Nikki had intended to reveal the news privately to Dylan but that opportunity never comes up." [...] Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, [...] "She feels very badly about Nick losing Avery but not bad enough that she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man — not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to be civil. She wants everyone to be happy together." [...] Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, [...] "Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know. I think Sean Carrigan could believably play my son. I think he looks <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> me, probably more like me than Steve Burton does." ...|$|E
