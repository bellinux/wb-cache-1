He began using his {{parliamentary}} position to advocate reform by introducing a Registration Bill, proposing limited changes to parliamentary election procedures. He brought forward a bill to extend the measure permitting the dissection after execution of criminals such as rapists, arsonists and thieves. The bill also advocated the reduction of sentences for women convicted of treason, <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>that</b> at the time included a husband's murder.

25|$|Asimov {{used this}} planet-hopping {{itinerary}} {{most notably in}} most of the volumes of the Foundation series from Foundation and Empire onward. Unlike the detective fiction methods of the previous Robot novels where Baley assembles the clues to <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>that</b> had been committed, in Robots and Empire, a murderous conspiracy developing against the Earth, and its discovery by the robots, keep pace with each other right up through the final confrontation with Amadiro on the Earth.

25|$|One {{significant}} change {{that resulted from}} the new laws was {{the definition of the}} term aggravated felony. Being convicted of <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>that</b> is categorized as an aggravated felony results in mandatory detention and deportation. The new definition of aggravated felony includes crimes such as shoplifting, which would be a misdemeanor in many states. The new laws have categorized a much wider range of crimes as aggravated felonies. The effect of this has been a large increase in permanent residents facing mandatory deportation from the United States without the opportunity to plea for relief. The 1996 deportation laws have received a lot of criticism for their curtailing of residents' rights.|$|E
