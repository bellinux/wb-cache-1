5|$|Bordagaray gained {{publicity}} {{through the}} press through his colorful personality and various gimmicks. He appeared in bit parts {{in movies and}} grew <b>a</b> <b>mustache</b> {{in a time when}} baseball players were expected to be clean shaven. He has been inducted into the Brooklyn Dodgers Hall of Fame, the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame, and the Ventura County Sports Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding out}} that Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) was flashed in the parking lot, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens an investigation. He orders Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to {{interview}} Phyllis and make a sketch of the flasher. However, Phyllis says she didn't {{get a good look}} at him, so Pam instead draws a picture of Dwight with <b>a</b> <b>mustache</b> and without glasses. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) assists (who also seems to notice that the sketch looks similar to Dwight) an oblivious Dwight in posting fliers with Pam's sketch on it around town.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{model for}} the iconography of Saint Jovan Vladimir is an engraving in the 1690 edition of the Greek akolouthia. It is a work by Venetian engraver Isabella Piccini. She depicted the saint with <b>a</b> <b>mustache</b> and short beard, wearing a cloak and a crown inscribed with lilies, holding a cross in his right hand, and his severed head in his left hand. A portable icon in Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, dated around 1700, shows the saint mounted on horseback.|$|E

5|$|During this time, Overton {{was known}} to sit in his bases' chapel in silence for {{extended}} periods of time, not praying, to calm his nerves. He also began to grow <b>a</b> <b>mustache,</b> though he professes not to be superstitious. Overton would continue to grow this mustache until immediately before his final flight, when he shaved it off. He also believed any number with a three in it, including the number 13, was lucky.|$|E
5|$|Robin (Cobie Smulders) {{suggests}} Ted {{give up on}} Stella {{and instead}} focus on Abby. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) agrees, as he made an appointment with Stella to check what she was like, and discovered she had a condition where she is only attracted to men with mustaches. Although Ted does not believe him, he still tries to grow <b>a</b> <b>mustache,</b> which Stella laughs at (a year earlier, Barney had made a ten-dollar bet with Ted {{that he could get}} him to grow <b>a</b> <b>mustache).</b> Upset, Ted says he gives up, but Lily (Alyson Hannigan) tells him to try again, as Stella is interested in him, though she says she has not been to see her. It is then revealed that Marshall (Jason Segel) had gone to see Stella to talk up Ted, and found out Stella had a crush on him. The book ended up belonging to Marshall. Happy that Stella is interested in him, Ted asks her out after his last session, but she says she does not have time for dating because she has a daughter.|$|E

25|$|This hadith {{does not}} specify the gender, and is {{sometimes}} {{claimed to be}} a basis for circumcision as a religious requirement for both males and females. However, Mohamed Salim Al-Awwa claims it is unclear if some or all of these religious requirements were meant for females, because cutting <b>a</b> <b>mustache</b> is an act typical to men.

25|$|Tomlin {{was one of}} {{the first}} female comedians to break out in male drag with her {{characters}} Tommy Velour and Rick. In 1982, she premiered Pervis Hawkins, a black rhythm-and-blues soul singer (patterned after Luther Vandross), with <b>a</b> <b>mustache,</b> beard, and close-cropped afro hairstyle, dressed in a three-piece suit. Tomlin used very little, if any, skin-darkening cosmetics as part of the character, instead depending on stage lighting to create the effect.|$|E
25|$|Snoopy's father, Baxter, and Snoopy's mother, Missy, {{have each}} {{appeared}} {{only once in}} the comic strip (father: June 18, 1989; Mother: July 26, 1996), but only Missy appeared on television. Missy appeared in Snoopy's Reunion in the flashback of when Snoopy and his siblings are born and being bought by people. Snoopy's father {{is said to have}} lived in Florida, and he wears glasses and has <b>a</b> <b>mustache.</b> Snoopy's mother looks like a female version of Snoopy (similar to Belle and Molly).|$|E
25|$|Neither Lupo nor Placido {{had seen}} their attacker, but two {{witnesses}} reported a tall, dark-haired {{man in a}} leisure suit fleeing from the area; one claimed to see him leave {{in a car and}} even supplied a partial license plate number. Another report described a blond man with <b>a</b> <b>mustache</b> who drove from the scene in a Chevy Nova without turning on its headlights. Police speculated that the dark-haired man was the shooter, and that the blond man had observed the crime.|$|E

25|$|It {{was banned}} {{due to the}} {{appearance}} of firearms throughout the episode, {{as well as a}} scene where Team Rocket's Meowth wears <b>a</b> <b>mustache</b> that looks too much like that of Adolf Hitler. The removal of this episode leads to continuity problems, as Ash captured 29 Tauros in this episode, and he got #30 from Brock with one of his Safari Balls. The Tauros appear in later episodes and are used in Pokémon Tournaments by Ash, and only one episode briefly alludes to where they came from.|$|E
25|$|The fee plugs {{which had}} aired {{in the middle}} of the show on the CBS version were {{featured}} during the closing credits. The ticket plugs were now shown on every episode. Each ticket plug had two people's faces merged into one image by putting a man's face on a woman's head, putting <b>a</b> <b>mustache</b> on a woman's face, or putting a pair of red lips on a man's face or simply putting two halves of the faces together. The 1990 ABC version used a similar sequence to introduce the stars.|$|E
25|$|Durova's {{youthful}} appearance {{hurt her}} chances for promotion. In {{an era when}} Russian officers were expected to grow <b>a</b> <b>mustache</b> {{she looked like a}} boy of sixteen. She transferred away from the hussars to the Lithuanian Uhlan Regiment {{in order to avoid the}} colonel's daughter who had fallen in love with her. Durova saw action again during Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812. She fought in the Battle of Smolensk. During the Battle of Borodino a cannonball wounded her in the leg, yet she continued serving full duty for several days afterward until her command ordered her away to recuperate. She retired from the army in 1816 with the rank of stabs-rotmistr, the equivalent of captain-lieutenant.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Martin Parker {{proved to}} be a man who might have been any age between thirty-five and forty-five. He had a dark face and <b>a</b> black <b>mustache.</b> <b>As</b> Pugsy had stated, in effect, he wore a morning coat, {{trousers}} with a crease which brought a smile of kindly approval to Smith's face, and patent-leather shoes of pronounced shininess.|$|R

25|$|The {{most famous}} Parthian art {{work is the}} bronze statue of a local prince found in the Iranian {{province}} of Bachtiyārī at Shami. It was found by farmers in {{the remains of a}} small shrine of Greek gods and Seleucid kings, who eventually became the cult of the gods and also of past rulers. The statue is almost perfectly preserved, with only the hands missing. It is made of two parts and consists of the body and the head, which was carried out separately and fitted later. The prince is standing in Parthian clothes with a dagger on the side. He wears medium length hair and <b>a</b> <b>mustache.</b> He wears long trousers and a tunic that leaves his chest partially exposed. The figure is aligned in front, radiating power and authority, even if the head seems disproportionately small. Daniel Schlumberger remarks that there is certainly a specific type that would have dressed thus. Here is a typical Parthian nobleman, {{as can be seen in}} the details of the costume. An inscription at the base assigns it to a specific person. The dating is uncertain, ranging somewhere from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD The prince has not yet been identified, though, is often assumed to be Surenas. The high quality of the work sparked a lively debate about the place of manufacture. Theories range from Susa to an artist from Palmyra, who created the work on site.|$|E
500|$|Bordagaray {{showed up}} at spring {{training}} in 1936 with <b>a</b> <b>mustache,</b> which he grew for a bit role in The Prisoner of Shark Island, filmed during the offseason. This was scandalous, as baseball players {{were expected to be}} clean shaven at the time; the last player believed to have worn <b>a</b> <b>mustache</b> was Wally Schang during the 1914 season. Looking for stories to write about, sportswriters for the Dodgers encouraged Bordagaray to grow out his mustache and goatee. The Brooklyn Eagle hosted a contest to determine what sort of beard Bordagaray should grow. After a few months, Dodgers manager Casey Stengel made him shave, saying [...] "If anyone's going to be a clown on this club, it's going to be me." [...] Mustaches would not be seen in MLB again until Oakland Athletics owner Charlie O. Finley paid his players to grow facial hair in the 1970s. Finley hosted a [...] "mustache day", and invited Bordagaray to serve as master of ceremonies.|$|E
500|$|The cold open {{received}} particularly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Myles McNutt called it [...] "clever" [...] {{and noted that}} even he had forgotten whether Stanley had <b>a</b> <b>mustache.</b> Lucy Teitler positively compared it to Guys and Dolls. Cindy White considered a [...] "great ensemble bit" [...] and that it showed promise for the episode, although it did not reach that promise.|$|E
