40|$|This {{study was}} done to {{evaluate}} precipitation annealing of 18 % Ni maraging steel repair welds during aluminium <b>alloy</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> and to predict the prolonged in-service tool life. The emphasis {{of this study was}} the influence of post-weld precipitation annealing heat treatment and aluminium die casting thermal cycling on metallurgical and mechanical properties. A series of specimens of 1. 2344 tool steel was prepared to which 1. 6356 maraging steel wasgas tungsten arc weld clad. Analysis of weld microstructure and hardness was made {{in order to understand the}} metallurgical processes during heat treatment at elevated temperatures and at prolonged time. The Response Surfacemodel for prediction of hardness after heat treatment was developed. The edges of immersion test specimens are gas tungsten arc weld clad with 1. 6356 maraging steel and machined to the final edge geometry. Two specimens were tested in as-welded condition and two in optimally aged condition. Testing was performed on specially developed immersion test apparatus, which enables the simulation of thermal fatigue during aluminium <b>alloy</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting.</b> After completion of a particular number of thermal fatigue cycles the weld microstructure and hardness were evaluated. A hypothetical model for prediction of precipitation annealing time during aluminium <b>alloy</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> was proposed. The results showed that tool heating lasts 30 % of molten metal injection time, preparing conditions for precipitation annealing at 10 % of injection time, and precipitation annealing at 60 % of injection time. These results, together with a finite element model for prediction of tool temperature and response surface model for prediction of hardness after precipitation annealing, enable accurate prediction of maraging steel tool hardness after any particular number of die casting cycles and consequently in-service tool life.

An innovative immersion testing apparatus is developed, at which Aluminium <b>Alloy</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> is simulated. It enables controlled thermal fatigue cycling. Special specimens with different edge geometry and specimens with maraging steel welds deposited by Gas Tungsten Arc (GTA) welding are prepared. They are subjected to cyclic heating in bath of molten Aluminium Alloy 226 and cooling in bath of water-based lubricant. The specimens are continuously internally cooled with cold water.

The samples were subjected to visual inspection after each phase of testing, before being examined for metallographic studies, surface crack measurement, and hardness characteristics. Furthermore, the samples were segmented and examined under optical and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The areas around the crack zones were additionally examined under Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS).

The crack length of Region I (spherically shaped) was about 47 to 127 µm, with a high oxygen content that was analyzed within 140 µm from the surface of the sample. At 700 °C, there is a formation of aluminum oxides, which was in contact with the surface of the H 13 sample.

50|$|Aluminium, zinc, zirconium, and thorium promote {{precipitation}} hardening: manganese improves corrosion resistance; and tin improves castability. Aluminium is {{the most}} common alloying element. The numerals correspond to the rounded-off percentage of the two main alloy elements, proceeding alphabetically as compositions become standard. Temper designation is much the same {{as in the case of}} aluminium. Using -F, -O, -H1, -T4, -T5, and -T6.Sand permanent-mold, and <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> are all well developed for magnesium <b>alloys,</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> being the most popular. Although magnesium is about twice as expensive as aluminium, its hot-chamber die-casting process is easier, more economical, and 40% to 50% faster than cold-chamber process required for aluminium. Forming behavior is poor at room temperature, but most conventional processes can be performed when the material is heated to temperatures of 450 - 700 F. As these temperatures are easily attained and generally do not require a protective atmosphere, many formed and drawn magnesium products are manufactured. The machinability of magnesium alloys is the best of any commercial metal, and in many applications, the savings in machining costs more than compensate for the increased cost of the material. It is necessary, however, to keep the tools sharp and to provide ample space for the chips. Magnesium alloys can be spot-welded nearly as easily as aluminium, but scratch brushing or chemical cleaning is necessary before the weld is formed. Fusion welding is carried out most easily by processes using an inert shielding atmosphere of argon or helium gas. Considerable misinformation exists regarding the fire hazard in processing magnesium alloys. It is true that magnesium alloys are highly combustible when in a finely divided form, such as powder or fine chips, and this hazard should never be ignored. Above 800 F, a non-combustible, oxygen-free atmosphere is required to suppress burning. Casting operations often require additional precautions because of the reactivity of magnesium with sand and water in sheet, bar, extruded or cast form; however, magnesium alloys present no real fire hazard.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{automotive}} use {{of magnesium}} is currently restricted to low-temperature structural components. Rare earth additions such as Ce, Nd, La and Pr {{are known to}} improve the creep performance. The {{aim of the research}} was to determine the effect of rare earths elements on the as-cast microstructure of magnesium alloys containing 4 wt% aluminum. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted on Mg- 4 Al- 2 RE (AE 42) and a new Mg- 4 Al- 4 RE (AE 44) alloys in the as-cast condition. The microstructure was characterized by optical microscopy (Olympus GX- 70) and a scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S 3400) equipped with an X-radiation detector EDS (VOYAGER of NORAN INSTRUMENTS). The phase identification of these alloys was identified by X-ray diffraction (JDX- 75). Findings: The microstructure of AE 42 alloy consists of α-Mg solid solution with divorced eutectic Mg 17 Al 12 + α-Mg, RE-rich phases and Mn-rich phase. The increase of RE contents from 2 wt% to 4 wt% leads to a change of microstructure of these alloys. In AE 44 alloy was observed globular, lamellar and acicular precipitations of Al 11 RE 3 and Al 3 RE phases. Moreover, there was found globular Mn-rich phase existence, but the Mg 17 Al 12 phase was not observed. Research limitations/implications: The increase of RE content to 4 wt% caused the formation of new phases in the microstructure and prevented the formation Mg 17 Al 12 phase. These factors can improve the creep resistance of the Mg-Al-RE alloys. The future research will contain creep tests and microstructural investigations of cast and die-cast alloys using TEM microscopy. Practical implications: The improvement of creep resistance of Mg-Al alloys can cause their application in automotive industry on the elevated-temperature structural components (above 150 °C).

Ca-based bulk metallic glasses have many unique properties such as low density (~ 2. 0 g/cm 3), low Youn g’s modulus (~ 20 to 30 GPa). The elastic modulus of Ca-b ased BMGs is comparable to that of hum an bone s, and Ca, Mg, and Zn are biocompatible. These features make the Ca-Mg-Zn–based alloys attractive for use in biomedical applications.

We have investigated PRPC (Porosity Reducing Post Compression) process of ADC 12 aluminum <b>alloy</b> <b>die</b> castings to reduce inside porosity. In this study, a validity of PRPC process is demonstrated {{in terms of}} the Charpy impact strength. We ensure that the porosity ratio was considerably reduced by the PRPC process by means of X-ray CT observation. We conclude that the Charpy impact strength improves since the effective cross-sectional area of the specimen concerning fracture increases after PRPC process without any harmful influence. This conclusion is exemplified by the flat fracture surface of the specimen after PRPC process...|$|R

Aluminum is readily die-cast to produce the complex squirrel cage within and around the iron laminations of the rotor. Copper is much more difficult to die-cast due to its high melting temperature which leads to premature die failure. The work reported here addresses the die life problem in <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> electrical grade copper. A number of candidate high temperature die materials were surveyed. Computer simulation of the cyclic thermal and stress gradients in dies provided insight into the “heat checking ” failure mechanism and how it could be minimized or avoided. A nickel-base <b>alloy</b> <b>die</b> system preheated to and operated at ~ 625 °C has been developed and shown to greatly extend die life compared to die steels operated conventionally. A die insert heating and insulation system was developed to make extended runs possible. Copper motor rotors were <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> over a range of machine operating parameters in joint effort with several motor manufacturers. Motor test result...|$|R
