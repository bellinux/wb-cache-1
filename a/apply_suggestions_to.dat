40|$|Different festivals {{are being}} held {{following}} {{the implementation of the}} local autonomy system. These festivals are having significant influences on the image enhancement of the regions holding the festivasl as well as the local economic stimulation. In terms of economic, social, and cultural perspectives, festivals have positive effects on the local society and are acting as resources for new opportunities in area development. In order for the festivals to be successful, preparation and efforts are needed to enhance the satisfaction of the festival spectators. This paper derived the evaluation factors which have influence on the festival satisfaction of spectators from the planning stage and constructed a study model. Then, regression analysis was <b>applied</b> for <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> be made on the evaluation of festival satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of a personal goal-based intervention on positive and negative moods among young athletes of a soccer academy. Study participants (n= 22) were randomized into either a treatment group with a personal goal management program (Bouffard, Labelle, Dubé, & Lapierre, 1999) or a control group. Participants' mood states were measured every three weeks. Results indicated a significant post-intervention group difference on the positive and negative moods states in favor of the treatment group. A significant within-group difference over time was also found for the treatment group.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a framework for assessing and quantifying "clusteredness" of a data representation. Clusteredness is a global univariate property defined as a layout diverging from equidistance of points to the closest neighbouring point set. The OPTICS algorithm encodes the global clusteredness {{as a pair of}} clusteredness-representative distances and an algorithmic ordering. We use this to construct an index for quantification of clusteredness, coined the OPTICS Cordillera, as the norm of subsequent differences over the pair. We provide lower and upper bounds and a normalization for the index. We show the index captures important aspects of clusteredness such as cluster compactness, cluster separation and number of clusters simultaneously. The index {{can be used as a}} goodness-of-clusteredness statistic, as a function over a grid or to compare different representations. For illustration, we <b>apply</b> our <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> dimensionality reduced 2 D representations of Californian counties with respect to 48 climate change related variables.

If psychology students are to capitalise on these exciting developments, visual methods teaching needs to be integrated into 'mainstream' qualitative methods training. This report offers an example of how this has been done through the use of three pedagogical practices, namely performative storytelling, modelling reflective practice, and learning through doing. It describes how these practices inform the authors' teaching of visual methods, gives an example of how these have been <b>applied,</b> and offers <b>suggestions</b> <b>to</b> the reader for other ways of developing these principles in practice...|$|R

40|$|High-quality writing {{instruction}} {{needs to}} permeate elementary students’ in- and outside-of-school experiences. The {{aim of this}} research was to explore how teaching writing to parents may support home-school literacy connections. This qualitative case study explored parents’ experiences in interactive writing sessions. The descriptive coding and constant comparative analysis of transcribed parent writing sessions, field notes, and documents revealed three themes: (1) Writing Tips and Strategies, (2) Parent-Writers, and (3) Story Connections. The parent writing sessions facilitated parents’ understanding of how to support their elementary-age children’s writing development. Parents demonstrated a desire to support their children’s writing development, and they needed strategies to understand how <b>to</b> help. Parents <b>applied</b> <b>suggestions</b> as writers <b>to</b> support their children’s writing development at home.

40|$|This paper aims {{to expand}} the scope of studies of Japanese shjo manga (girls 2 ̆ 7 comics) by {{examining}} early 1980 s and 1990 s shjo manga that were primarily targeted at the youngest band of readers, stories with early adolescent heroines in light, romantic, and fairytale-like narratives. These have been paid comparatively little scholarly attention thus far compared with texts that enact more explicit gender subversion, such as stories that feature same-sex male love and cross-dressed fighting girls. We argue, however, that the maidenesque (otomechikku) subgenres enact complex and fascinating versions of girlhood. Furthermore, we propose that these neglected manga benefit especially from an analysis that prioritises the visual dimensions of shjo manga. We <b>apply</b> these <b>suggestions</b> <b>to</b> our analysis of fashion and aesthetic in heretofore neglected maidenesque works by Takase Ry. Rather than simply maintaining conservative norms of femininity and heterosexual romance, these works explore gender issues within the safe trappings of girlishness. Examining the visual and textual dimensions of such works is vital for a more accurate picture of girlhood and gender as it is more broadly imagined in shjo manga...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{supports}} Loftin’s {{conclusion that}} first order partials as cur-rently used in linked pair tests are inappropriate. It {{points out that}} for each cross-cultural correlation there are not one but at least two control traits: namely one constructed from each substantive variable. This sug-gests that not first but second order partials are appropriate diffusion control measures. The paper <b>applies</b> this <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> Loftin’s hypothetical data and discusses the results. [Accepted for publication: February 1975. ] For a reader familiar with the methodological literature of cross-cultural research, this article may appear as yet another contribution to the steadily growing list of &dquo;solutions&dquo; to Gal-ton’s problem. However, one should not forget that {{the sheer number of}} existing solutions (for a recent summary see Wirsing n. d., Schaefer 1974, Naroll 1970) does not mean that much is known about the theoretical and methodological implications of this extremely complex problem. We are rather {{in the midst of a}} lively discussion which aims at clarifying our ideas and modifying our procedures. This article, therefore, should be understood as a critical discussion of one promising-yet still faulty-approach to Galton’s problem, and as a suggestion of how it can be modified and corrected. We are referring here to the use of first order partial corre-lations as a means of controlling for diffusion. This promising approach was first suggested by Naroll in 1964 (pp. 866 - 67) ...|$|R
40|$|Inbreeding in {{hatchery}} {{fish populations}} causes loss of genetic variability. This reduces the effective population size (Ne) for breeding programs. Seven {{ways to increase}} Ne are suggested: (1) mate each available female with a single male; (2) include both early- and late-maturing fish in matings and avoid selection for other traits; (3) import fertilized eggs from areas within the hatchery 2 ̆ 7 s drainage or from adjacent drainages; (4) import sperm from wild or adjacent hatchery populations; (5) rear about 20 independent families that can be tagged to estimate family-size variance; (6) store sperm from in-house males cryogenically for later out-crosses; and (7) ensure that progeny of all matings are represented among released fish and replacement brook stock. Practical considerations determine which of these <b>suggestions</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> particular hatchery operations, but the success of each depends on sustained commitment by management, careful monitoring, and objective evaluation...|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} {{competitive}} electricity markets {{are prone to}} the same cycles of boom and bust that appear in commodity markets and in a specialized industry like real estate. The article then demonstrates how boom and bust might appear in the western electricity system using computer simulation. A “business as usual ” simulation shows that the west might be at {{the crest of a}} building boom and {{on the verge of a}} bust in wholesale prices. Without fundamental changes in the wholesale markets, the next construction boom would come too late to prevent a decline in reserve margins and the reappearance of price spikes. If we continue with the current market structure, we run the risk of exposing the western electricity markets to another round of reliability alerts and price spikes. The article concludes with suggestions for alternative market structures in California and a discussion of whether these <b>suggestions</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> other countries engaged in electricity restructuring...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 This study's {{purpose was}} to provide data on major {{inhibitory}} factors experienced by a third of Oregon high school English teachers in areas of: attitudes, behaviors, and physical and emotional effects of theme assessment. Methods employed two analyses: (1) statistical testing of the independent variable of teaching experience (1 to 2, 3 to 5, 6 to 10, and 11 + years) applied to twelve null hypotheses by the Chi-Square test for significance; and (2) descriptive analysis of frequencies. Hypotheses were stated to measure {{no significant differences between}} years of experience and twelve assumptions about: 1) number of themes assessed per month, 2) hours spent per month on theme assessment, 3) assessment turnaround time, 4) amount of commentary given, 5) perceptions that most students do not seem <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> assessment <b>suggestions</b> <b>to</b> subsequent themes, 6) fatigue affecting judgment in assessment, 7) perceptions that assessment may adversely affect eyesight, 8) feelings of despair over students making the same errors previously pointed out, 9) perceptions that burnout is related to assessment, 1 O) perceptions that a journalism copy editing course would be unlikely to lessen assessment time, ll) the belief that composition should be taught as a separate course, 12) perceptions that a teachers' short course on assessment would have practical application to an increased theme load. Measured by Chi-Square, the first hypotheses was rejected; the other eleven were retained. Descriptive analyses supported null hypotheses results and yielded conclusions about: l) assessment loads and teachers behaviors, 2) in-service training and assistance, and 3) attitudes about a national standardized theme structure, theme writing per se, and work loads of other disciplines. Recommendations include smaller and fewer classes, a separate composition course, and further assessment training, Suggestions for further research include investigating the lack of militancy in high school English teachers, feasibility of shifting assessment training to Education Departments, applicability of copy editing training, studying teachers' physical and emotion-related ailments...|$|R
