5|$|During {{this period}} Gaudí perfected his {{personal}} style, {{inspired by the}} organic shapes of nature, putting into practise {{a whole series of}} new structural solutions originating from his deep analysis of ruled geometry. To this he added a great creative freedom and <b>an</b> <b>imaginative</b> ornamental style. His works acquired a great structural richness, with shapes and volumes devoid of rational rigidity or any classic premise.|$|E
5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} <b>an</b> <b>imaginative</b> realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} {{to reflect the}} real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E
5|$|The {{content is}} divided into five parts. The first part, Ancient Balances, {{considers}} psychological and historical aspects of debt. Atwood calls debt <b>an</b> <b>imaginative</b> human construct derived {{from a sense of}} need or greed and a sense of fairness in reciprocity and equivalent values. She cites a study by Frans de Waal that suggests a sense of fairness may be a genetic trait shared with other primates, and a study by Robert Axelrod which illustrates, given a level playing field, that the tit-for-tat strategy (or 'Do unto others as they have done onto you' strategy) was the most superior strategy in game theory. Debt and borrowing mechanisms from ancient and biblical societies are compared, including provisions from the Code of Hammurabi, Ancient Egyptians, and the Greco-Roman mythologies.|$|E

5|$|The {{entrance}} is resolved {{in a manner}} simultaneously elegant and eccentric, in an almost exuberant and free syntax. The canonical orders are absent, and the collection is conceived as <b>an</b> <b>imaginative</b> blend of quasi-archaeological redeployment. For this reason, critics do not attribute the project to Cairano, which remains a formidable invention that is highly representative of antiquarian culture of the time. Surely Cairano's, however, is the hand that produced the sculptures along with anthropomorphic figures, dolphins and fantastic creatures, the artist already experimented with these in the Loggia; and once again, the artist inserted small Caesars, both on the portal {{as well as the}} overpass, which achieve the poetic zenith of some of his portraiture of old.|$|E

25|$|Cognitive {{linguistics}} views linguistic {{structure as}} arising continuously out of usage.

25|$|Frank Kermode {{has written}} that midrash is <b>an</b> <b>imaginative</b> way of 'updating, enhancing, augmenting, explaining, and {{justifying}} the sacred text'. Because the Tanakh became {{to be seen as}} unintelligible or even offensive, midrash {{could be used as a}} means of rewriting it in a way that both makes it more acceptable to later ethical standards and renders it less obviously implausible.|$|E
25|$|The {{complexity}} of the state system demanded <b>an</b> <b>imaginative</b> policy from the emperor which required minimal {{use of force in}} such a large empire having diverse forms of economy and religions. It could not have been controlled by an army alone. A more feasible alternative was the propagation of a policy that would work at an ideological level and reach out to all sections of the society. The policy of Dharma was such an endeavour.|$|E
25|$|Scholars such as Thomas L. Thompson {{view the}} patriarchical narratives, {{including}} {{the life of}} Jacob, as late (6th and 5th centuries BCE) literary compositions that have ideological and theological purposes but are unreliable for historical reconstruction of the presettlement period of Israel’s past. In Thompson's The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives, he suggests that the patriarchal narratives arose in a response to some present situation, expressed as <b>an</b> <b>imaginative</b> picture of the past to embody present hope.|$|E

25|$|Latrobe's {{design for}} the Capitol was <b>an</b> <b>imaginative</b> {{interpretation}} of the classical orders not constrained by historical precedent, incorporating American motifs such as corncobs and tobacco leaves. This idiosyncratic approach became typical of the American attitude to Greek detailing. His overall plan for the Capitol did not survive, though many of his interiors did. He also did notable work on the Supreme Court interior (1806–07), and his masterpiece was the Basilica of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, Baltimore (1805–21).|$|E
25|$|Garbo was a shy daydreamer as a child. She hated {{school and}} {{preferred}} to play alone. Yet she was <b>an</b> <b>imaginative</b> child and a natural leader who {{became interested in}} theatre at an early age. She directed her friends in make-believe games and performances and dreamed of becoming an actress. Later, she would participate in amateur theatre with her friends and frequent the Mosebacke Theatre. At the age of 13, Garbo graduated from school, and, typical of a Swedish working class girl at that time, she did not attend high school. She would later confess she had an inferiority complex about this.|$|E
25|$|While Invasion Literature had {{provided}} <b>an</b> <b>imaginative</b> {{foundation for the}} idea of the heart of the British Empire being conquered by foreign forces, it was not until The War of the Worlds that the reading public was presented with an adversary completely superior to themselves. A significant motivating force behind the success of the British Empire was its use of sophisticated technology; the Martians, also attempting to establish an empire on Earth, have technology superior to their British adversaries. In The War of the Worlds, Wells depicted an imperial power as the victim of imperial aggression, and thus perhaps encouraging the reader to consider imperialism itself.|$|E
