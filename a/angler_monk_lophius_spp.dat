40|$|Anglerfish (<b>Lophius</b> <b>spp.)</b> is {{consumed}} worldwide {{and is an}} important economic resource though its seven species are often fraudulently interchanged due to their different commercial value, especially when sold {{in the form of}} fillets or pieces. Molecular analysis is the only possible mean to verify traceability and counteract fraud. We developed two multiplex PCRs, one end-point and one real-time with melting curve post-amplification analysis, which can even be run with the simplest two-channel thermocyclers. The two methods were tested on seventy-five reference samples. Their specificity was checked in twenty more species of those most commonly available on the market and in other species of the Lophiidae family. Both methods, the choice of which depends on the equipment and budget of the lab, provide a rapid and easy-to-read response, improving both the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of existing methods for identifying Lophius species. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|To date, {{research}} efforts on Lophius species in waters around Scotland (ICES Divisions IVa, VIa, and VIb) have focused almost exclu-sively on Lophius piscatorius. Here, the characteristics {{and distribution of}} the Lophius budegassa component of the catch are described using data collected by observers during commercial fishing trips and scientific surveys on chartered commercial fishing vessels between 1998 and 2006. At Rockall Bank (VIb), L. budegassa were rare, just 0. 1 % of the catch of <b>Lophius</b> <b>spp.,</b> whereas west of Scotland (VIa) and around the Shetland Islands (IVa), they made up 18 and 2 % of catches, respectively, with greatest prevalence towards the shelf edge. Fish length ranged from 16 to 89 cm with a modal length at 40 cm. Greater proportions of large individuals were recorded around the Shetland Islands than {{in other parts of}} the study area.

40|$|In {{response}} to a request from the Department of Communications Marine and Natural Resources and fishing industry, the conversion factors used to estimate round or live weights from gutted anglerfish were re-examined. A number of data sources was available from survey data, port sampling and observer trips. In some cases, the liver is left in place when the fish are gutted. For these landings a separate conversion factor is necessary. The conversion factors {{were found to be}} independent of fish size, however, some significant differences between the data sources were found. Significant differences between the conversion factors of the two species of anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius and L. budegassa) were also found. As commercial landings of anglerfish are not usually speciated, a generic conversion factor was estimated for <b>Lophius</b> <b>spp.</b> by combining the data for both species after weighting by the estimated proportions of the two species in the Irish landings. The resultant conversion factor for fully gutted fish is 1. 23 and 1. 17 when the liver is left in place; both estimates are lower than the current Irish factor of 1. 28.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mercury is a {{well-known}} toxic element present in seafood. Nevertheless some antioxidants, like selenium, as an integral component of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, and alpha-tocopherol having a protective role against it, are present as well. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the levels of total mercury (Hg-T), organic mercury (Hg-Org), Se and alpha-tocopherol in some adult deep-water fish species caught off Portuguese waters. RESULTS: Levels of Hg-T were above EU limits in 6 % of <b>Lophius</b> <b>spp.</b> and Aphanopus carbo, 2 % ofLepidorhombus spp. and 70 % of Helicolenus dactylopterus. Hg-Org represented the major fraction (more than 84 %) of Hg-T in all studied muscles. The selenium concentration in muscle was similar in all species (about 0. 4 mg kg(- 1) wet weight) and the highest level of alpha-tocopherol (70 mg kg(- 1) wet weight) was found in Aphanopus carbo. CONCLUSION: The muscle of all species studied is a good source of selenium, but only can give a small contribution of alpha-tocopherol. Attending to the provisional tolerable weekly intake established by the WHO/FAO for methylmercury, it appears that the species studied should be consumed sparingly.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study, a high {{percentage}} of Japanese anglerfish, Lophius litulon (Jordan, 1902), contained a microsporidian infection of the nervous tissues. Xenomas were removed and prepared for standard wax histology and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). DNA extractions were performed on parasite spores and used in PCR and sequencing reactions. Fresh spores measured 3. 4 × 1. 8 µm and were uniform in size with no dimorphism observed. TEM confirmed that only a single developmental cycle and a single spore form were present. Small subunit (SSU) rDNA sequences were> 99. 5 % similar to those of Spraguea lophii (Doflein, 1898) and Glugea americanus (Takvorian et Cali, 1986) from the European and American <b>Lophius</b> <b>spp.</b> respectively. The microsporidian from the nervous tissue of L. litulon undoubtedly belongs in the genus Spraguea Sprague et Vávra, 1976 and the authors suggest a revision to the generic description of Spraguea to include monomorphic forms and the transfer of Glugea americanus to Spraguea americana comb. n. Since no major differences in ultrastructure or SSU rDNA sequence data exist between Spraguea americana and the microsporidian from the Japanese anglerfish, they evidently belong to the same species. This report of Spraguea americana is the first report of a Spraguea species from L. litulon and indeed from the Pacific water mass. Microsporidian parasites found in the nervous tissues of anglerfish of the genus Lophius were first reported by Thélohan (1895), who described the infection of the spinal ganglia of Lophius piscatorius (Linnaeus, 1758) collected from the Atlantic coast of France with a species of Glugea, but was unable to complete his description. Doflein (1898) found the same condition in L. piscatorius sampled from Italy, and as the parasite assemblages resembled those described by Moniez (1887) for Glugea anomala, infecting the musculature of the stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus, the microsporidian from L. piscatorius was assigned to this genus an...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an observer trip on a Japanese freezer longliner {{in the international}} waters of the North East Atlantic {{in the autumn of}} 1997. The observation period was 71 days during which 7 species were recorded as catch and bycatch from 57 sets. Although bluefin tuna was the target species, with 18, 894 kg gilled and gutted weight (GWT) caught, the most frequently retained species was blue shark, Prionace glauca, followed by bluefin tuna. Three shortfin mako shark, Isurus oxyrinchus, one swordfish, Xiphias gladius and one anglerfish, <b>Lophius</b> <b>spp.,</b> were also recorded. The most frequently discarded species were lancetfish Alepisaurus ferox, and deal fish Trachipterus arcticus. Bluefin tuna ranged from 139 cm to 275 cm in fork length (FL) and from 64 kg to 347 kg in round weight (RWT) with clear modes of 190 cm and 136 kg. Recent ageing results from the North East Atlantic infer ages of 4 to 17 years old. CPUE was lower than Norwegian sponsored trials in the North East Atlantic in 1998 and similar to those computed by the Japanese longline observer programme in 2000, 2001 and 2002. There was no evidence of trend in bluefin CPUE {{over the course of the}} observation period. The modelled length weight relationship predicted higher values than established length weight relationships for bluefin tuna in the East Atlantic: ICCAT modelled RWT for East Atlantic bluefin was 87 % of the observed round weight and 90 % of the predicted RWT value for Koshin Maru # 8 tuna. Over the observation period the condition of bluefin tuna was found to decline and examination of stomachs showed that most were empty or contained low numbers of prey items. Declining condition factors and apparent scarcity of prey are discussed in the context of CPUE. Prey scarcity reflected in declining condition may increase the effectiveness of baited hooks causing abundance estimates derived from CPUE series to over-estimate the population of bluefin tuna in the North East Atlantic. Investigation of condition indices has the potential to estimate stock ratios in longline catches in the North Atlantic. All observed blue shark catch were female with lengths ranging from 140 cm to 250 cm. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|R
5000|$|In South Africa, hake is {{targeted}} by four distinct fisheries: the offshore and inshore demersal trawl fisheries, and the hake longline and hake handline sectors. The offshore demersal trawl fishery {{is by far}} the biggest of the four. Approximately 84% of the hake total allowable catch (TAC) is allocated to the offshore demersal trawl fishery. The inshore trawl and hake longline fisheries are each allocated approximately 6% of the TAC and the handline fishery presently accounts for about 3% of the allocation, although this has not been caught in recent years. [...] Trawling for hake takes place in a near continuous band on well-established grounds that extend from the Namibian border on the west coast to the extreme eastern part of the Agulhas Bank off the south-east coast. [...] Exploitation is predominantly at depths of between 300 to 800m on the west coast and less than 200m on the south coast. [...] The offshore demersal trawl fleet consists of 52 trawlers. Twenty-seven fresh fish trawlers preserve hake on ice and return it to shore for processing, while 18 freezer vessels produce frozen headed and gutted (H&G) hake. Seven more sophisticated freezer trawlers produce frozen fillets at sea [...] The gear configuration consists of “otter trawls” - gear towed along the seabed with trawl doors (or otter boards) keeping the mouth of the net open. Trawlers generally tow their nets at 3.5 knots for one to three hours, mainly in daylight when targeting hake [...] Trawling occurs mainly over sandy sediments, but areas of muddy substrate and coarser, gravely substrates are also trawled [...] A five-year (2014-2019) benthic trawl experiment is currently underway [...] The purpose of the experiment is to determine the environmental impact of demersal trawling in South African waters. It is being implemented by SADSTIA in partnership with the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry & Fisheries, the University of Cape Town, the South African Environmental Observation Network and the South African National Biodiversity Institute. The catch of the offshore demersal trawl sector amounts to approximately 130 000 tonnes per year (2013 catches) [...] although this has varied between 118 and 166 000 tonnes, and consists of approximately 90% M. paradoxus and 10% M. capensis. The main bycatch species are kingklip (Genypterus capensis) and <b>monk</b> (<b>Lophius</b> vomerinus). Trawler owners and operators produce a mix of fresh and frozen products, supplying them to retail and food-service markets both locally and internationally. The main export markets are in Europe, Australia and the United States.|$|R
40|$|The Planning Group on Commercial Catches, Discards and Biological Sampling [PGCCDBS] (Co-Chairs: Mike Armstrong, UK, and Gráinne Ní Chonchúir, Ireland) met in Belfast, Northern Ireland, 18 th February – 22 nd February 2013, in {{parallel}} with the Mediterranean Planning Group for Methodological Development (PGMed). The PGCCDBS was established in 2002 {{in response to the}} EC-ICES Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) requesting ICES to provide support for the EU Data Collection Framework (DCF). It implements the ICES Quality Assurance Framework to ensure that data sets and parameters supporting assessments and advice for the ICES area are based on i) statistically-sound sampling schemes; ii) correct and consistent inter-pretation of biological material such as otoliths and gonads; iii) technology that im-proves accuracy and cost-effectiveness of data collection; iv) comprehensive and easily sourced documentation, and v) efficient collaboration between PGCCDBS, ex-pert groups and other bodies in relation to data collection. The 2013 meeting of PGCCDBS focused on work completed since last year, and planned work for 2013 and 2014, in the following topics which formed the basis of the Terms of Reference: Stock-based biological parameters from sampling of fishery and survey catches (age, growth, maturity, fecundity, sex ratio) - Fleet/métier related variables (discards estimates and length/age composi-tions of landings and discards) and statistical design of sampling schemes - Data collection technology (hardware, and software such as WebGR and the Regional Data bases). - Implementation of the ICES Quality Assurance Framework - Addressing recommendations and requests for advice from ICES expert groups (including through PGCCDBS data contact persons), and RCMs. During 2013, the PGCCDBS was requested to address an additional Term of Refer-ence as follows: a) Identify reasons for differences between raised discards estimates provided by ICES and STECF, and make recommendations on how to resolve this problem in the short and longer term. The PGCCDBS met in plenary with PGMed to review the outcomes {{of a wide range of}} workshops and age exchanges conducted since PGCCDBS 2012 and the workplan for 2013. On the basis of this and the PGCCDBS long term planning process, further workshops and exchanges were proposed for 2014 and beyond. These include: - Age and maturity workshops: WKSABCAL, the Workshop on the Statistical Analysis of Biological Calibration Studies (which had been postponed); WKARA, workshop on age reading of anglerfish <b>Lophius</b> <b>spp</b> will be con-sidered during the 2014 meeting, and a workshop will be proposed for 2015 if any advances in the knowledge of age reading of anglerfish have been made. - Sampling design workshops: in order to take forward the work of the series of WKPICS (Workshop on the Practical Implementation of Statistical Sound catch Sampling Programmes) and SGPIDS (Study Group on Practical Implementation of Discard Sampling Plans) which finish in 2013, PGCCDBS proposes the establishment of a Working Group on Commercial Catches to provide ongoing support for the design, implementation and analysis of sampling programmes for commercial fisheries. - Large-scale age exchanges: Whiting (Merlangius merlangus); Megrim (Lepidorhombus spp); Sole(Solea solea); Sprat (Sprattus sprattus, all areas); Horse mackerel and Mediterranean horse mackerel (T. picturatus and T. mediterraneus) - PGCCDBS 2013 also updated the list of national age readers and co-ordinators, and this updated list was uploaded onto the European Age Readers Forum (EARF). Other proposals developed by PGCCDBS are: - Proposals for study contracts on i) anglerfish ageing (Lophius piscatorius); ii) Study proposal on age determination and maturity staging of species not previously subjected to biological sampling for analytical assessments. - Proposal for a training course covering the design of statistically sound catch sampling for fisheries monitoring programmes - ICES cooperative research report (CRR) on the Protocols on the ageing of dif-ferent fish species in the ICES area. PGCCDBS further developed its proposal for the CRR and and developed a work plan for this. PGCCDBS developed work plans for intersessional work related to development of Quality Assurance reports for fishery sampling, including testing a prototype QA report with selected ICES stock assessment expert groups, and circulating a ques-tionnaire to collect information on national approaches to the construction and appli-cation of age-length keys. The ToR’s for PGCCDBS 2014 were also discussed and agreed, see Annex 11, and it was also agreed that the PGCCDBS 2014 meeting will be held in Constanta, Romania, Monday the 10 th of February – Friday the 14 st of February 2014...|$|R
