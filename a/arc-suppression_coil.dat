50|$|The {{advantage}} {{of the system is}} that it does not require a neutral to eliminate the earth-fault current. Therefore, the VSS has been implemented especially in networks which were operated with isolated neutral. During an earth fault in the network, the system eliminates earth-fault current. The function is in principle similar to an <b>arc-suppression</b> <b>coil.</b> In comparison to the <b>arc-suppression</b> <b>coil,</b> VSS eliminates earth-fault current more efficiently, even in unbalanced or extremely unbalanced networks.|$|E

5000|$|Voltage Symmetrization System (VSS) was {{developed}} especially for electric power networks with great phase voltage unbalance. It is a three-phase system which enables earth-fault current and charging current elimination. Until now, the operation with earth-fault current compensation {{has been very}} complicated for the networks with a great voltage unbalance. In the past, {{it was necessary to}} operate such networks with an isolated neutral, solid grounding or with a significantly untuned <b>arc-suppression</b> <b>coil.</b> VSS can also substitute for an <b>arc-suppression</b> <b>coil</b> or it can complement it parallelly. Moreover, it contributes to a better function of earth-fault protections for high-resistance earth faults by equalizing phase-to-earth capacity unbalance. The VSS was patented.The three-phase VSS has several basic functions: ...|$|E
50|$|As VSS {{does not}} require neutral for its connection, it can be {{connected}} anywhere in the network. At the same time, {{it is possible to}} adjust its power to a certain part of the network only, which can be use in local distribution networks or in long feeders, in feeders with high value of charging current, or in feeders with high capacity unbalance. The part of the network in which VSS is installed does not increase the value of phase-to-earth capacity current in power supply network. Furthermore, the value of network’s charging current decreases by the set system power. The VSS is very beneficial in networks with island operation. In island operation, the source is not loaded by charging current of the line and the separated island area is operated with resonant grounding. Such qualities cannot be reached with a classic <b>arc-suppression</b> <b>coil.</b>|$|E

If these systems are used in high voltage power distribution networks which incorporate open-delta regulators, dangerous over-voltages can occur. Because the open-delta regulators increase the line to earth voltage in two phases only, out of balance line to earth capacitance currents flow through the <b>arc-suppression</b> <b>coil.</b> It is shown that under certain conditions the resultant system voltages can reach dangerous levels. It is recommended that a detailed analysis be carried out before arc-suppression coils and open-delta regulators are installed in the same power system...|$|E

Accurately {{measuring}} {{capacitive current}} for the automatic tuning <b>arc-suppression</b> <b>coil</b> is the premise and basis of realizing its compensating and arc-extinguishing functions. Several principles measuring capacitive current applied widely are theoretically analyzed and compared. The resonance method {{to measure the}} capacitive current has high precision, but has complex tuning. The displacement voltage method has simple tuning, but has poor accuracy of measuring capacitive current. The measurement accuracy of the impedance triangle method and the E 0 measurement method lies between the resonance method and displacement voltage method. And its tuning is also relatively simple, but its measurement and control system is more complex. At last, to choose appropriate capacitive current measurement method according to the <b>arc-suppression</b> <b>coil</b> tuning principle and the distribution network operation is pointed out...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} deal with the problem of {{single-phase}} earthing fault in resonant grounded system, a new method of fault line and segment selection was proposed using zero-sequence current increment through analyzing the line fault on substation outlet and the change of the fault component of zero-sequence current. The zero-sequence current in the line will change when the inductance of <b>arc-suppression</b> <b>coil</b> is changed. The method determines the fault location based on the characteristic of the change in the line. The effects of resistance grounding can be eliminated by converting zero-sequence currents to the same voltage. Matlab simulation experiments verify the correctness and validity of the method...|$|E

40|$|The most {{widespread}} {{system of}} an earthing neutral {{point of a}} supply transformer in a MV network is an earthing through an <b>arc-suppression</b> <b>coil.</b> In this case of a resonant-earthed power system a fault current is compensated by the suppression coil and only residual current flows through a fault point. A value of the residual current is much smaller then a value of an original capacitive current of the network and is not dependent on the fault location. According to that reasons it is really complicated to fast and accurately determine the fault point location. Since nowadays used methods for the ground fault location inside wide distribution networks {{have a lot of}} disadvantages, the thesis is focused on a proposal of a new method for the ground fault location especially inside of a compensated network. The main reasons for a consecutive installation of power quality meters into distribution transformer substations are a power quality monitoring and a global evolution of an electrical network onto the “SmartGrids”. In case that all results from the meters are properly synchronized and centralized, new possibilities of control or of an evaluation of a network are enabled. This doctoral thesis proposes the possibility for the ground fault detection with an aid of synchronized records recorded on the low-voltage side of the distribution transformers 22 / 0. 4 kV into the network equipped with automatics for short-time increasing of an active part of a faulty current. The described method uses a voltage drop evoked by connecting of the auxiliary resistor for location of the faulty section. The proposed method is tested with help of numerical model which presents a part of the distribution network Series of simulation are executed and correct function and force function of the method is reviewed. Finally the thesis describes real experiment and also a confrontation between simulation and real measuring, and also possibilities of method usage are commented...|$|E
