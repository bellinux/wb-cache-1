He learned {{to read and write}} reportedly out of curiosity after reading and hearing comic books and stories of Kalimán and Porfirio Cadena, El Ojo del Vidrio on the local radio station. In his autobiography, Moreno González said that as a child he believed he had the superhuman ability of speaking telepathically with animals like Kalimán did in the comics. He said {{he wanted to be a}} hero like the comic characters. As a child, he was <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> gunmen near his home, and played las guerritas ("war games") for fun. While playing the game, he often pretended to be dead, only to say later on that he had been wounded in the game but that he had managed to survive. At the age of twelve, he moved to Apatzingán and made a living by selling matches, peeling onions, working at a melon field, and throwing out the trash from several booths at a marketplace. As a teenager in the late 1980s, Moreno González migrated illegally to the United States, settling in California, where he eventually began selling marijuana. After some years, he moved to Texas and in 1994 was arrested for drug trafficking charges in McAllen. Nearly a decade later in 2003, the U.S. government charged him with conspiracy to distribute five tons of narcotics and issued an arrest warrant. Moreno González then fled back to Mexico.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} silver was {{eliminated}} from the half dollar, it {{had been out of}} circulation for so long that banks had eliminated the slot for the denomination from machines. The Mint anticipated a comeback for the denomination, but in July 1971, Mint Director Mary Brooks disclosed that the Treasury was holding 200million of the new base metal half dollars, as commercial banks expressed little interest in ordering them. [...] "I can't understand the population. [...] They're not using them." [...] According to Brooks, most of the over one billion Kennedy half dollars containing silver had been hoarded by the public. [...] Brooks theorized that because the silver Kennedy half dollar never circulated much and few half dollars were struck in 1970 in anticipation of the authorization to eliminate silver, the public had become <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> not <b>seeing</b> the half dollar in trade. [...] Brooks suggested, [...] "If the country knew there were plenty of them around, they'd probably start hoarding them, too." ...|$|R

The Russian wondered why such a reputable man should be fighting for the First French Republic. Sérurier retorted, [...] "My father, in giving me my sword, expressly ordered me to use it only to defend my country". Historian Ramsay Weston Phipps considered Verderio to be the biggest blunder of Sérurier's career. He suggested that the general was <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> Bonaparte save dire situations with brilliant maneuvers. When Moreau next saw the paroled general, he severely reprimanded him but later admitted to the government that Sérurier's only mistake was hewing to his orders too rigidly. This was the last time Sérurier led troops in combat.|$|E
500|$|Although {{both the}} Cubists and the Futurists {{conveyed}} movement and speed within the two dimensions of a painting, it was Pollock who brought dynamic {{movement to the}} canvas in the 1950s with his form of abstract expressionism known as gestural painting in works such as Autumn Rhythm, 1950. In Little Big Painting and subsequently even more so in Big Painting No. 6 and Yellow and Green Brushstrokes, for example, dynamic activity was a prominent feature of the series. Lichtenstein's loops and depiction of sweeping gestures all resemble Pollock's gestural painting. As {{a result of this}} series, Lichtenstein was able to present works to the viewing audience that resembled what they had become <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>seeing,</b> however, his result is completely flat without any trace of the brushstroke or the artist's hand. Meanwhile, the work references mechanical printing with the Ben-Day dots background, which enables Lichtenstein to parody his predecessors and make a [...] "powerful abstract composition". The effort to make the painting appear mechanically produced by flattening the brushstroke also gives the illusion that the brushstroke is floating freely.|$|E

We are {{in the habit of}} dividing ourselves into two or three groups in order to follow the buffalo, which in the spring go back into the west, and in autumn come down into these parts; there are herds of these buffalo, which go sometimes as far as the Missouri; we kill them with arrows; our young hunters are very skilful at this hunting. You understand, moreover, that these animals are in very great numbers, and as tame as if they were raised on a farm; consequently, we are very careful never to frighten them. When they stay on a prairie or in a forest, we camp near them in order <b>to</b> <b>accustom</b> them <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> us, and we follow all their wanderings so that they cannot get away from us.

I have six children whom I love a great deal, and with whom I want to end my days.When my warriors were rested and refreshed, I took leave of Joseph and of the Atakapas, while assuring them of my desire {{to be able to make}} some returns for their friendly welcome, and I resumed my Journey.

40|$|Just as museum {{professionals}} and visitors {{are becoming more}} <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> preparing, <b>seeing,</b> and using computers in exhibits, the possibilities for interactivity are mushrooming with the expansion of computer networks. Researchers are beginning to develop environments in which many people can be &quot;present &quot; simultaneously. The current contexts typically include meeting places and some type of game-playing, but the milieus present possibilities for serious learning as well. In this paper I describe some {{of the history of}} networked multiuser spaces, sketch aspects of a learning environment and online community, and explain how this example suggests a model for museum outreach. The model addresses a dilemma in museum education: designing for smooth traffic flow through exhibit areas works against possibilities for time-intensive involvement with materials and ideas, which leads to learning in any deep sense. The Development of Networked Multiuser Spaces Systems for simultaneous use by many users have evolved through the convergence of several pathways. Since the earliest days of the Internet, facilities such as electronic mail and the &quot;talk &quot; fimction have enabled communication between users sharing a system. Electronic mail allows sending and replying to messages according to one's own schedule and convenience; on Unix systems, users can use the &quot;finger &quot; program to find out who else is on the system {{at the same time and}} the &quot;talk &quot; program to initiate and sustain a volley of text messages with them. These facilities are normally used in the context of the workplace.

500|$|Biographer Robert Tate {{went further}} in his examination. During his {{research}} he contacted Professor Rafael Scheck, Head of History at Colby College. Scheck published Hitler's African Victims: The German Army Massacres of Black French Soldiers in 1940 {{and is an}} acknowledged expert on racial theory and in Nazi Germany. Without being familiar with Marseille, Scheck identified his friendship with Matthias was in direct contradiction to the Nazi mandate. Sheck doubted Marseille's [...] "acquisition" [...] of Matthais and his role as Marseille's [...] "batman", was done out of disrespect. Sheck said, [...] "I know of the camp commandant of the concentration camp of Mathausen, who held a black man as his personal servant. This was done out of disrespect, however. I {{do not think that}} aspect was relevant for Marseille." [...] When questioned on Marseille's behaviour, Sheck said, [...] "I do not find it odd because I am <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> many nuances among the Germans of the Third Reich. But his behaviour would probably be startling for many other researchers." [...] Tate also noted Marseille's penchant for Cuban rumba by Ernesto Lecuona, jazz and swing which he believes was another way of resisting Nazi ideals.|$|E
500|$|Mark Washburn of Knight Ridder {{wrote that}} at the time of the episode's broadcast, most Americans were <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> {{homosexual}} characters on television. He said this is why Patty's coming-out did not become as controversial as the episode's examination of the same-sex marriage issue, which was more sensitive in the country then. The controversy became so big that local news programs in certain cities aired segments about it. In response to the claims that this episode was supporting gay marriage, Al Jean replied that [...] "we don't really take any positions for or against anything, we just like to examine all sides of an issue and I think that anyone who would get their political wisdom from a cartoon might be sadly mistaken." [...] Likewise, Mark Pinsky writes in The Gospel According to The Simpsons that once the episode ended, it was hard to tell what stance on same-sex marriage the writers had and that [...] "both sides of the controversy had their say, voiced by various Simpsons characters". Jean has also cited the episode in defense to critics who say The Simpsons has lost its relevance and edginess in later years. In his book , John Ortved responded to this, commenting that despite the controversies the episode was [...] "in fact a long-winded and lame exploration of the topic." ...|$|E

It's the feeling of being part of the world." [...] A local resident said that the concert was [...] "proof that we have peace here, that everything is OK". Fans from outside the former Yugoslavia described Sarajevo as [...] "an oasis of light" [...] in the midst of destroyed and fire-damaged buildings, and deserted villages. Despite the subpar performance, the Associated Press said, [...] "For two magical hours, the rock band U2 achieved what warriors, politicians and diplomats could not: They united Bosnia." [...] Andrew Mueller of The Independent wrote, [...] "For {{the first time since the}} start of the war in 1992, people more <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> each other through the sights of a rifle were converging on the capital to listen to music together.

40|$|N. Catach : « The Written Markers of Words Throughout History » The various {{devices and}} {{auxiliary}} signs {{that can be}} added to writing, in order to make word-units (or groups of words) easier to identify, have always existed, and have always made up one of the essential components of writing systems : the paragraphemic level. In the Classical tradition, we find a wide range of signs, many more than our modernday, typographical vision has <b>accustomed</b> us <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> : i. e. not only spaces delimiting groups of letters, and signs indicating the separation of elements (points, hyphens, symbols, punctuation, etc.). The causes of our modern, limited vision of things are no doubt to be found in our over-estimation of the role played by the letters of the alphabet alone in visual activity, and in the under-estimation of the substantial and complex evolution of what constitutes, for us, « reading-units ». To take only the example of the European Middle Ages, we can find, in the writing of Latin, from one type of writing to another, a very varied range of graphic signs, both intra- and extra-Linear, all of which must be taken into account, and whose main purpose was to make the task of reading easier. All these Medieval visual devices have contributed to our present rich stock of symbols, typographical as well as electronic. It is therefore necessary to acquire a wider and unprejudiced view of the major historical role that has always been played by the different levels of writing systems in making reading easier, and in identifying and conceiving the « word » as a distinct unit.

In addition, Hogan used the Axe Bomber, a crooked arm lariat, as his finisher in Japan instead of the running leg drop that has been his standard finisher in America. Hogan still made appearances for the WWF, even unsuccessfully challenging Pedro Morales for the Intercontinental Championship on March 26, 1981. On June 2, 1983, Hogan became the first International Wrestling Grand Prix (IWGP) tournament winner (although he held the IWGP Heavyweight Championship belt, this was not the beginning of the actual championship), defeating Antonio Inoki by knockout in the finals of a ten-man tournament. Hogan and Inoki also worked as partners in Japan, winning the MSG Tag League tournament two years in a row: in 1982 and 1983. In 1984, Hogan returned to NJPW to wrestle Inoki in the finals of the IWGP League, in which he lost the title belt by countout, thanks to interference from Riki Choshu.
