5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This {{is the result of}} a drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the <b>agricultural</b> <b>system.</b> This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.|$|E
5|$|The semi-natural, unfertilized {{pastures}} {{formed by}} traditional agricultural methods in Europe were managed by grazing and mowing.

This strategy is declining in Europe today due to the intensification of agriculture. The mechanized and chemical methods used are causing biodiversity to decline.|$|E

Finally, we use a case study of a hillside production system in Ecuador to illustrate the importance of model coupling, dynamics and heterogeneity in the analysis of production systems. This example shows that feedbacks and threshold effects are most important at sites most vulnerable to tillage erosion...|$|R

40|$|Habitat {{conversion}} is {{the primary}} driver of biodiversity loss, yet {{little is known about}} how it is restructuring the tree of life by favoring some lineages over others. We combined a complete avian phylogeny with 12 years of Costa Rican bird surveys (118, 127 detections across 487 species) sampled in three land uses: forest reserves, diversified <b>agricultural</b> <b>systems,</b> and intensive monocultures. Diversified <b>agricultural</b> <b>systems</b> supported 600 million more years of evolutionary history than intensive monocultures but 300 million fewer years than forests. Compared with species with many extant relatives, evolutionary distinct species were extirpated at higher rates in both diversified and intensive <b>agricultural</b> <b>systems.</b> Forests are therefore essential for maintaining diversity across the tree of life, but diversified <b>agricultural</b> <b>systems</b> may help buffer against extreme loss of phylogenetic diversity...|$|R

25|$|In {{subtropical}} and arid environments, {{the timing}} and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring irrigation. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as agroforestry.

The largest of these were Cuernavaca and Huaxtepec (now spelled Oaxtepec).

25|$|After the Xianbei {{conquest of}} Northern China, it {{experienced}} {{an economic recovery}} under the Northern Wei that was even greater than the prosperous era of Yuanjia.

A new <b>agricultural</b> <b>system</b> was introduced; in the equal-field system, the state rented land to the peasant labourers for life, reclaiming it after the tenant's death.

Encroachment on this land led to uprisings and guerilla warfare by the Yaquis after 1887. By 1895, the federal and state governments began to violently repress the Yaquis and forcefully relocate captured Yaquis to the plantations in Mexico’s tropical south, especially the henequen plantations in the Yucatán Peninsula. The Yaqui resistance continued into the 20th century, with the expulsions reaching a peak between 1904 and 1908, by which time about one quarter of this population had been deported. Still more were forced to flee into Arizona.|$|E

As such, adaptive management {{may be the most}} appropriate method for sustainably intensifying production whilst increasing {{the quantity and quality of}} ecosystem services.

We suggest that an adaptive management perspective would support the implementation of a systematic analysis of the social, ecological and economic trade-offs occurring within such systems, particularly between ecosystem services and functions, in order to provide suitable and comparable assessments.

25|$|Changes in China's food {{production}} system are generating {{an awareness of}} food safety problems. China's <b>agricultural</b> <b>system</b> is composed mostly of small land-holding farmers and subsistence agriculture. China, however, has less arable land than other nations and farmers intensively use fertilizer and pesticides to maintain high {{food production}}. Food is sold in both open air markets and urban supermarkets, and by the late 1990s, China's farms were adapting to more specialized crop production as the local markets become more connected to the national and international markets. However, local authorities largely control food regulation enforcement unless the central government steps in. As urban consumers' incomes increase, the demand for quality food goods, safer production, and processed foods also increases, and urban residents and supermarkets attract more national and media attention to food problems.|$|E
25|$|Another post-war {{activity}} was Huxley's {{attack on the}} Soviet politico-scientist Trofim Lysenko, who had espoused a Lamarckian heredity, made unscientific pronouncements on agriculture, used his influence to destroy classical genetics in Russia and to move genuine scientists from their posts. In 1940, the leading botanical geneticist Nikolai Vavilov was arrested, and Lysenko replaced him {{as director of the}} Institute of Genetics. In 1941, Vavilov was tried, found guilty of 'sabotage' and sentenced to death. Reprieved, he died in jail of malnutrition in 1943. Lysenko's machinations were the cause of his arrest. Worse still, Lysenkoism not only denied proven genetic facts, it stopped the artificial selection of crops on Darwinian principles. This {{may have contributed to the}} regular shortage of food from the Soviet <b>agricultural</b> <b>system</b> (Soviet famines). Huxley, who had twice visited the Soviet Union, was originally not anti-communist, but the ruthless adoption of Lysenkoism by Joseph Stalin ended his tolerant attitude. Lysenko ended his days in a Soviet mental hospital, and Vavilov's reputation was posthumously restored in 1955.|$|E
