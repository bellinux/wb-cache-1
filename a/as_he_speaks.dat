25|$|Heima, {{tied up with}} rope, reveals Shihei's plot {{to seize}} power, {{describing}} each detail and he bemoans his fate, having failed in his mission to kill Kan Shōjō, and having been captured. Hearing of Shihei's treachery, Kan Shōjō becomes enraged, breaking off a branch from the plum tree and striking off Heima's head with it, {{as if it were}} a sword. He asks Shiradayū and Umeōmaru to hurry to the capital, to warn the emperor of Shihei's plans. Knowing that he cannot return to the capital himself, at least not in body, having been formally exiled, he vows to return as an angry spirit. To that end, he vows to journey to the summit of Mount Tenpai, where he will engage in austere disciplines, swear oaths to the gods, and become a ghostly lord of thunders. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>speaks,</b> a storm rises up. His retainers grasp at his sleeves and try to stop him, but he throws them off, and flies off into the sky, already beginning to transform into a thunder spirit.|$|E
25|$|At Bazarov's home, {{they are}} {{received}} enthusiastically by his parents, {{and the traditional}} moeurs of both father and mother, who adulate their son, are portrayed with a nostalgic, idealistic description of humble people and their fast-disappearing world of simple values and virtues. Bazarov's social cynicism, invariably on display with outsiders, is still quite clear as he settles back into his own family's ambiance. Interrupting his father <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> to Arkady, he proves rather abrupt and still the powerful center of attention despite being around his parents. Arkady, who has delighted Bazarov's father by assuring him that his son has a brilliant future in store, in turn reproves his friend for his brusqueness. Later, Bazarov almost comes to blows with Arkady after the latter makes a joke about fighting over Bazarov's cynicism. This once again shows the distance and changes within Arkady and Bazarov's relationship, as Arkady becomes more defiant against Bazarov's ideals. After a brief stay, much to the parents' disappointment, they decide to return to Maryino, stopping {{on the way to}} see Madame Odintsova, who receives them coolly. They leave almost immediately and return to Arkady's home.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene where}} Anniyan {{addresses}} a huge gathering {{was shot in}} a stadium in Hyderabad. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> to the audience, the lights turn on and off in the background. Speaking on how the sequence was filmed, Ravi Varman said that they decided not to light up the entire stadium as they felt it would have looked flat. As the sequence was important to the film, he juxtaposed the stadium with light and shadow {{so that it would}} look different. During the pre-climax scene, when Ambi is held custody and enquired by Prabhakar, Ambi's persona keeps switching between the characters Ambi and Anniyan. Dubbed the [...] "chameleon act" [...] in the media, Vikram claims to have completed the sequence in a single take.|$|E

500|$|Shakespeare's {{account of}} the battle was mostly based on chroniclers Edward Hall's and Raphael Holinshed's {{dramatic}} versions of history, which were sourced from Vergil's chronicle. However, Shakespeare's attitude towards Richard was shaped by scholar Thomas More, whose writings displayed extreme bias against the Yorkist king. [...] The result of these influences is a script that vilifies the king, and Shakespeare had few qualms about departing from history to incite drama. Margaret of Anjou died in 1482, but Shakespeare had her speak to Richard's mother before the battle to foreshadow Richard's fate and fulfill the prophecy she had given in Henry VI. [...] Shakespeare exaggerated the cause of Richard's restless night before the battle, imagining it as a haunting by the ghosts of those whom the king had murdered, including Buckingham. [...] Richard is portrayed as suffering a pang of conscience, but <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> he regains his confidence and asserts {{that he will be}} evil, if such needed to retain his crown.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{commercial}} breaks, a brief {{image of a}} glyph is shown. Abrams revealed {{in an interview that}} the glyphs had a hidden meaning. [...] "It's something that we're doing for people who care to figure it out and follow it, but it's not something that a viewer has to consider when they watch the show." [...] Abrams also revealed that the seemingly unrelated frogs which have the Greek letter Phi (Φ) imprinted on their back appeared in promos for the show have significance {{within the context of the}} series, saying [...] "it's part of the code of the show." [...] The glyph code was cracked by an editor at the technology site Ars Technica, who discovered it to be a simple substitution cipher used to spell out a single thematic word for each episode; for example, the pilot episode's eight glyphs spell out the word [...] "observer". Whether there is a further second-order code to be solved remains to be seen. Additionally, the glyphs are representative of some of the means by which Walter solves a case (such as the moth/butterfly from [...] "Johari Window", the seahorse strain of DNA from [...] "The Bishop Revival"). In [...] "Jacksonville", behind Walter <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> to Olivia about her treatment where the nootropic Cortexiphan was first studied as a trial, each of the glyphs is clearly visible on the daycare wall. An episode-by-episode key to the various glyphs was made available on Fringepedia.|$|E

2500|$|In {{their second}} appearance, [...] "", they capture and {{assimilate}} Captain Jean-Luc Picard into the collective by surgically altering him, creating Locutus of Borg, meaning [...] "he who has spoken" [...] or [...] "he who speaks", in Latin, fitting <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> to Federation humans for them.

2500|$|The above {{explanation}} {{of the origin of}} the term is lacking. As Russell and Norvig in their book [...] have written, referring to the above story: [...] "This cannot be strictly true, because his first paper using the term (Bellman, 1952) appeared before Wilson became Secretary of Defense in 1953.” Also, there is a comment in a speech by , where he remembers Bellman. Quoting Kushner <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> of Bellman: [...] "On the other hand, when I asked him the same question, he replied {{that he was trying to}} upstage Dantzig's linear programming by adding dynamic. Perhaps both motivations were true." ...|$|E
2500|$|Plautus {{also used}} more {{technical}} means of expression in his plays. One tool that Plautus {{used for the}} expression of his servus callidus stock character was alliteration. Alliteration is the repetition of sounds in a sentence or clause; those sounds usually come at the beginning of words. In the Miles Gloriosus, the servus callidus is Palaestrio. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> with the character, Periplectomenus, he uses a significant amount of alliteration in order to assert his cleverness and, therefore, his authority. Plautus uses phrases such as [...] "falsiloquom, falsicum, falsiiurium" [...] (MG l. 191). These words express the deep and respectable knowledge that Palaestrio has of the Latin language. Alliteration can also happen at the endings of words as well. For example, Palaestrio says, [...] "linguam, perfidiam, malitiam atque audaciam, confidentiam, ...|$|E

The mentor lays down {{the basis of our}} story as we travel through the Sun. He explains that the [...] "man in the sun is called the Core (voiced by William Shatner)" [...] and spins a story how he is good and that his children [...] "photons" [...] are sent out to chase away the darkness, and bring life, warmth, and knowledge to Earth. He adds that the only being who does not like the Core is a creature called the [...] "Void" [...] (voiced by Mark Hamill) who is an ancient, malevolent, being who existed before the Big Bang, and who sits {{at the edge of the}} solar system, scheming to stop the Core.|$|E
2500|$|An earlier 1963 {{study by}} the poet James Radcliffe Squires spoke to the {{distinction}} of Frost as a poet whose verse soars more for the difficulty and skill by which he attains his final visions, than for the philosophical purity of the visions themselves. [...] "'He has written {{at a time when}} the choice for the poet seemed to lie among the forms of despair: Science, solipsism, or the religion of the past century…Frost has refused all of these and in the refusal has long seemed less dramatically committed than others…But no, he must be seen as dramatically uncommitted to the single solution…Insofar as Frost allows to both fact and intuition a bright kingdom, he speaks for many of us. [...] Insofar <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> through an amalgam of senses and sure experience so that his poetry seems a nostalgic memory with overtones touching some conceivable future, he speaks better than most of us.
