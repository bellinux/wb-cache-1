5|$|Tony gets Meadow's boyfriend Finn De Trolio {{a summer}} job at a {{construction}} site, which is run by Aprile crew capo Vito Spatafore. Finn comes in early one morning and catches Vito performing fellatio on a security guard. Vito tries to buddy up to Finn so {{that he does not}} say anything to <b>anybody</b> <b>else.</b> He even asks Finn to a Yankees game, which Finn does not attend. Finn soon quits the job out of fear.|$|E

5|$|Physically, Britten {{was never}} robust. He walked and swam {{regularly}} and kept himself as fit as he could, but Carpenter in his 1992 biography mentions 20 illnesses, {{a few of}} them minor but most fairly serious, suffered over the years by Britten before his final heart complaint developed. Emotionally, according to some commentators, Britten never completely grew up, retaining in his outlook something of a child's view of the world. He was not always confident that he was the genius others declared him to be, and though he was hypercritical of his own works, he was acutely, even aggressively sensitive to criticism from <b>anybody</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both {{women are}} {{reported}} to have had many paranormal experiences before and after their adventure. In one of them, Moberly claimed to {{have seen in the}} Louvre in 1914 an apparition of the Roman emperor Constantine, a man of unusual height wearing a gold crown and a toga; he was not observed by <b>anybody</b> <b>else.</b> During the First World War, Jourdain, the dominant personality of the pair who had succeeded as Principal of St. Hugh's, became convinced that a German spy was hiding in the college. After developing increasingly autocratic behaviour, she died suddenly in 1924 {{in the middle of an}} academic scandal over her leadership of the college, her conduct having provoked mass resignations of academic staff. Moberly died in 1937.|$|E
5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E

50|$|Finally, {{the book}} explores the social {{dynamics}} {{of a situation}} where nobody can trust <b>anybody</b> <b>else's</b> judgement, not even their own. The eventual outcome of this is more fully detailed in the sequel, Beowulf's Children.|$|R
5|$|The Gepids were a major Germanic {{people in}} what is now eastern Hungary, western Romania, and {{northern}} Serbia. Although the details of his early life are not known, Thurisind is believed to have risen to power in about 548. After the death of Elemund, the previous king, he seized the throne in a coup d'état and forced Elemund's son Ostrogotha into exile. Ostrogotha and his followers found refuge among the Gepids' neighbours and enemies, the Lombards, another Germanic people who had just settled {{in the western part of}} the Pannonian Basin. The Gepids had inhabited parts of the basin since the 3rd century. They reached prominence in the 5th century when, under King Ardaric, they played a key role in destroying the Hunnic Empire. Ardaric and his people benefited more than <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> from this victory, gaining the former Roman province of Dacia.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Murray Hill Publishing sued 20th Century Fox for $150,000, {{claiming}} that {{the idea for the}} film was stolen from a screenplay they had purchased from high school teacher Brian Webster entitled Could This Be Christmas?. They said the script had 36 similarities with Jingle All the Way, including the plot, dialogue and character names. Murray Hill President Bob Laurel bought the script from Webster in 1993, and sent it to Fox and other studios in 1994 but received no response and claimed the idea was copied by Kornfield, who was Fox's script reader. In 2001, Fox were found guilty of stealing the idea and ordered to pay $19 million ($15 million in damages and $4 million in legal costs) to Murray Hill, with Webster to receive a portion. Laurel died {{a few months after the}} verdict, before receiving any of the money. On appeal, the damages figure was lowered to $1.5 million, before the verdict itself was quashed in 2004 after a judge decided the idea was not stolen, as Fox had bought Kornfield's screenplay before he or <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> at Fox had read Could This Be Christmas?.|$|E
5|$|In the Metamorphoses by Antoninus Liberalis, written {{somewhere in}} the 2nd or 3rd century A.D., the myth is set in Phoenicia, near Mount Lebanon. Here King Thias, son of Belus and Orithyia, had a {{daughter}} named Smyrna. Being of great beauty, she was sought by men from far and wide. She had devised many tricks in order to delay her parents and defer the day they would choose a husband for her. Smyrna had been driven mad by desire for her father {{and did not want}} <b>anybody</b> <b>else.</b> At first she hid her desires, eventually telling her nurse, Hippolyte, the secret of her true feelings. Hippolyte told the king that a girl of exalted parentage wanted to lie with him, but in secret. The affair lasted {{for an extended period of}} time, and Smyrna became pregnant. At this point, Thias desired to know who she was so he hid a light, illuminating the room and discovering Smyrna's identity when she entered. In shock, Smyrna gave birth prematurely to her child. She then raised her hands and said a prayer, which was heard by Zeus who took pity on her and turned her into a tree. Thias killed himself, and it was on the wish of Zeus that the child was brought up and named Adonis.|$|E

5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E
5|$|Several {{individuals}} have consistently scored highly and/or earned medals on the IMO: As of July 2015 Zhuo Qun Song (Canada) {{is the most}} successful participant with five gold medals (including one perfect score in 2015) and one bronze medal. Reid Barton (United States) was the first participant to win a gold medal four times (1998-2001). Barton {{is also one of}} only eight four-time Putnam Fellow (2001–04). Christian Reiher (Germany), Lisa Sauermann (Germany), Teodor von Burg (Serbia), and Nipun Pitimanaaree (Thailand) are the only other participants to have won four gold medals (2000–03, 2008–11, 2009–12, 2010–13, and 2011–14 respectively); Reiher also received a bronze medal (1999), Sauermann a silver medal (2007), von Burg a silver medal (2008) and a bronze medal (2007), and Pitimanaaree a silver medal (2009). Wolfgang Burmeister (East Germany), Martin Härterich (West Germany), Iurie Boreico (Moldova), and Lim Jeck (Singapore) are the only other participants besides Reiher, Sauermann, von Burg, and Pitimanaaree to win five medals with at least three of them gold. Ciprian Manolescu (Romania) managed to write a perfect paper (42 points) for gold medal more times than <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> {{in the history of the}} competition, doing it all three times he participated in the IMO (1995, 1996, 1997). Manolescu is also a three-time Putnam Fellow (1997, 1998, 2000). Eugenia Malinnikova (Soviet Union) is the highest-scoring female contestant in IMO history. She has 3 gold medals in IMO 1989 (41 points), IMO 1990 (42) and IMO 1991 (42), missing only 1 point in 1989 to precede Manolescu's achievement.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Lizzie querulously, [...] "I am {{very anxious}} {{to know what he}} thinks. I care more about his opinion than <b>anybody</b> <b>else's.</b> As to his name being mixed up in it,--that is all a joke." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{they both}} laughed, {{and went on}} out of hearing. It showed how unpopular old Uncle Silas had got to be now. They wouldn't 'a' let a nigger steal <b>anybody</b> <b>else's</b> corn and never done {{anything}} to him.|$|R
60|$|John. Why, brother, our {{condition}} at {{this rate}} is worse than <b>anybody</b> <b>else's,</b> for we can neither go away nor stay here. I am of the same mind with the lepers of Samaria: 'If we stay here we are sure to die', I mean especially as you and I are stated, without a dwelling-house of our own, and without lodging in <b>anybody</b> <b>else's.</b> There is no lying in the street {{at such a time}} as this; we had as good go into the dead-cart at once. Therefore I say, if we stay here we are sure to die, and if we go away we can but die; I am resolved to be gone.|$|R
25|$|Richards was a {{prolific}} scorer in county cricket {{for many years}} for Hampshire. He scored 2395 runs in his first season, 1968, more than <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> in the country. From 1970, Richards established {{one of the most}} successful opening partnerships for that county, along with West Indian batsman Gordon Greenidge.|$|E
25|$|Magic {{formulae}} usually required {{secrecy and}} could lose their power if they became known {{by other people}} than their owners. For example, a Chugach man experienced a sea otter swimming around, singing a song, a magic formula. He knew it is a help in hunting, whose efficiency will be lost for him if <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> learns it.|$|E
25|$|While {{operating}} the crank {{a piece of}} shrapnel entered Anderson's back, paralyzing his legs but he continued to lower the boat and after looking {{around to see if}} <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> needed help, the ensign slipped over the side into an oil slick. With a broken leg Anderson swam over to a wounded officer in the water and attempted to pull him to one of the life rafts but the man died of his wound first and a few moments later the Germans lowered boats and began rescuing the Americans. The Germans fired 148 shells and one torpedo while Stanvac Calcutta fired only twenty-five, hundreds of machine gun rounds were also expended by both sides.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not my poor brother {{as well as}} <b>anybody</b> <b>else's?</b> And {{her husband}} too! How was I to let it out {{in that sort of}} way? At any rate he is dead as Julius Cæsar. I saw him buried,--right away at 'Frisco." ...|$|R
5000|$|With {{her husband}} held as a {{prisoner}} of war in Germany, Mildred has developed a heavy drinking habit. As Ahmed Kasim reports to Bronowsky, [...] "She begins first, finishes last and has two drinks to <b>anybody</b> <b>else's</b> one." [...] Her behavior is erratic.|$|R
60|$|She {{would go}} round {{to the studio}} and see Kirk. After all, it was his affair as much as <b>anybody</b> <b>else's,</b> {{and she had a}} feeling that {{it would be easier to}} break the news to him than to Ruth and Mrs. Porter.|$|R
25|$|The economy {{seemed to}} be all set for long-run growth, as shown by {{sustainable}} and promising growth rates from 1994 to 1997. However, the Asian Crisis contagion which started from Thailand and Korea started affecting the Philippines. This prompted the Philippine economy to plunge into continuous devaluation and very risky ventures, resulting in property busts and a negative growth rate. The remarkable feat of the administration, however, {{was that it was}} able to withstand the contagion effect of the Asian Crisis better than <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> in the neighboring countries. Most important in the administration was that it made clear the important tenets of reform, which included economic liberalization, stronger institutional foundations for development, redistribution, and political reform.|$|E
25|$|Some days later, Bhim Chand sent {{a message}} to Anandpur, asking the Guru to lend the Prasadi {{elephant}} to him. Bhim Chand wanted the elephant to make a display of his wealth to the guests at his son's proposed wedding. The Guru suspected that Bhim Chand wanted to gain permanent possession of the elephant, and declined the Raja's demand. He stated that the devotee who had presented the elephant didn't want it to be given away to <b>anybody</b> <b>else.</b> Bhim Chand is said to have sent his emissaries thrice to the Guru, the last one being Raja Kesari Chand of Jaswal. However, the Guru didn't accept his demand, and refused to part with the elephant.|$|E
25|$|In the Upper School, ages 16 to 18, {{responsibility}} {{is available through}} a hierarchy of positions. This starts with Captains of Sports, Service and House. In the case of Captains, no peer voting takes place but rather a pupil is elected by the Head of the respective department. This way {{it is not uncommon}} for some people to be re-elected as Captain for multiple terms depending on whether or not <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> of suitable stance is available. Captains of Sport such as the Football or Rugby Captain are chosen by the Head of that sport and will help the Head organise teams for practice and preparation off the field of play as well as on it. Similarly Captains of Service will aid the Head of Service organise training sessions and be a point of contact for the rest of the members.|$|E

5000|$|.....you shall find {{spiritual life}} in every church. I {{know it is}} the notion of the bigot, that all the truly godly people belong to the {{denomination}} which he adorns. Orthodoxy is my doxy; heterodoxy is <b>anybody</b> <b>else’s</b> doxy who does not agree with me.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, {{next morning}} I set out by {{myself in the}} coach from Schlangenbad. I went forth into the world to live my own life, partly {{because it was just}} then so fashionable, but mainly because fate had denied me the chance of living <b>anybody</b> <b>else's.</b>|$|R
