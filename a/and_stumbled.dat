5|$|On {{this same}} road, closer to Yongdong, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry, which {{was trying to}} help the cutoff units of the 8th Cavalry, was itself {{attacked}} by strong North Korean units. Through some error, the US battalion's F Company advanced to the wrong hill <b>and</b> <b>stumbled</b> into a concentration of North Korean soldiers. Only 26 men from F Company returned, the rest were killed or captured in the subsequent ambush. Altogether, the 5th Cavalry Regiment suffered 275 casualties on July 25.|$|E
5|$|This brought wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans to {{the crease}} and exposed the hosts' lower-order. The {{last of the}} {{specialist}} batsmen, Compton nearly departed soon after when he leaned forward to a leg-side delivery from Johnson's off spin. He overbalanced <b>and</b> <b>stumbled</b> forwards, and Tallon removed the bails. There were no television replays to assist the umpires in those days, and although the attempted stumping appeared close to the naked eye, {{the benefit of the}} doubt was given to the batsman and the appeal rejected. Compton made use of this and attacked Toshack successfully, forcing Bradman to make a bowling change. In fading light, Compton combined with the gloveman to add 75 runs for the seventh wicket in 70 minutes, before Lindwall removed Evans—who attempted a wild slash—to leave England 216/7. Compton reached stumps on 64, accompanied by Alec Bedser, who was on four, as England ended the day at 231/7. Compton had been dropped one-handed on 50 by Tallon, before being missed on 64 by the wicket-keeper from the bowling of Johnston just before stumps.|$|E
5|$|Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat. England {{consolidated}} their innings after falling to 2/28. The hosts were content to score slowly and regroup, and Johnson’s first ten overs before lunch yielded only seven runs. However, when Johnson was bowling his second spell after lunch, Jack Crapp hit three driven boundaries in quick succession. Crapp {{was eager to}} use his feet {{to get to the}} pitch of Johnson’s deliveries, and subsequently dealt with the spin fairly comfortably, whereas many of his compatriots stood in their crease and found matters much more difficult. Crapp's counter-attack prompted Bradman to take the second new ball and remove Johnson with the score at 2/96. England then lost three quick wickets to the pacemen to be 5/119. Soon after, Yardley lofted Ernie Toshackwho was bowling leg theoryinto the on-side and Johnson caught him for 22 at forward square leg to leave England at 6/141. Soon after, Compton, the last of the specialist batsmen, nearly departed when he leaned forward to a leg-side delivery from Johnson. He overbalanced <b>and</b> <b>stumbled</b> forwards, and Tallon removed the bails. There were no television replays to assist the umpires in those days, and although the attempted stumping appeared close to the naked eye, {{the benefit of the doubt}} was given to the batsman and the appeal rejected.|$|E

25|$|Around noon On 7 January 1888, Morcom was {{crossing}} Rundle Street in Adelaide {{when he became}} giddy <b>and</b> <b>stumbled</b> between the wheels of an oncoming trolley, landing on his stomach. The trolley driver, a James Rossiter, was unaware of Morcom's situation and drove the trolley, with its five tonne payload, over Morcom, fracturing his left thigh. Morcom was taken to Royal Adelaide Hospital, where surgeons thought it unnecessary to amputate his left leg. In hospital, Morcom progressed favourably until early {{on the morning of}} 15 January, when his condition deteriorated; he died at 3.00pm that afternoon.|$|E

25|$|Now the Kandyans {{concentrated}} {{their attack}} on the middle column. After heavy fighting they were repulsed, but this took some time during which the middle column became separated from the vanguard, who were continuing their running battle. In the confusion the elephants carrying Dona Catarina and other valuables, including the ammunition reserves, left the column and wandered into the forest. Meanwhile the advance guard, now proceeding without a guide, took a wrong turn <b>and</b> <b>stumbled</b> into a marshy field. Here the Kandyans surrounded and overwhelmed them. Following them in, the second column mounted a better resistance, managing to hold out for three hours, but they were eventually annihilated after their captains Henrique Pinto and Diogo Borges were killed.|$|E
25|$|The 2013–14 season saw the Pacers jump to an {{explosive}} {{first half of}} a season, as they started the season 33-7 thanks {{to the rise of}} Paul George and Lance Stephenson.. There were talks about the Pacers becoming the next team to hit the 70 win mark, which had only been achieved by the 1995–1996 Chicago Bulls. Paul George and Roy Hibbert were selected for the All Star Game. However, after the All Star Break, the Pacers collapsed. After starting the season 40-11, the Pacers crashed <b>and</b> <b>stumbled</b> to a 16-15 finish, with rumors of fighting in the locker room being a potential cause for the meltdown. Regardless, they managed to hold onto their first seed in the East, finished the season with a 56-26 record.|$|E
25|$|Charles Straub had {{a seat in}} {{the family}} circle close to the stairway; he was in the company of his friend Joseph Kreamer. He remembered, “we could hardly run down the stairs; we were crowded down.” Though at first he saw no smoke, {{by the time he had}} been carried down to the last flight, it had grown thicker. There he tripped and people fell on top of him. By then the last flight of stairs was dark and full of smoke. Straub {{struggled}} up <b>and</b> <b>stumbled</b> forward. He estimated that about twenty-five people had gotten out ahead of him. Wondrously, though he had been pushed down three flights of stairs and thought that hundreds had fallen on top of him, only about ten or twelve people came out onto the street after him. He waited around the Washington Street entrance for three-quarters of an hour, but he never saw his friend Kreamer emerge from the stairway, nor did he ever see him again.|$|E

He subsequently had a great start to his 2007–2008 season at the Cup of China where he skated two clean and strong programs, achieving new personal best scores for both his free skate and overall score and winning the gold medal over fellow American Evan Lysacek. He then went on to Cup of Russia and took the gold medal there, as well. The two first-place finishes secured him a spot at the 2007–2008 Grand Prix Final, where Weir competed with a recurring injury in his landing foot <b>and</b> <b>stumbled</b> in both his short and long programs but still managed to place 4th overall.|$|E
25|$|A relay of German {{reconnaissance}} aircraft observed British waters during the morning, Luftwaffe aircraft flying {{as far north}} as Scotland. Over Yarmouth, a Hurricane was damaged by return fire from a Do17 and then the Dornier was shot down by Douglas Bader of 242 Squadron based at Coltishall. Squadron Leader Peter Townsend, 85 Squadron, baled out near Harwich after being hit by a Do17 belonging to II./KG 2, which returned with three wounded crew. Encouraged by the relative immunity of the Stukas in the morning attack, Hugo Sperrle ordered Luftflotte 3 to follow up the attack; Bf110s from ZG 76 would provide escort in place of the Bf109s. At 11:00 GMT, Hurricanes from 601 Squadron were scrambled to intercept a reconnaissance Do 17, missed it <b>and</b> <b>stumbled</b> into a formation of Ju87s from III./StG 2 escorted by about 40 Bf110s, that radar had failed to locate. The escorts were too high above the Ju87s to stop the first attack. Most squadrons in the Middle Wallop sector were re-fuelling but six 238 Squadron Hurricanes were scrambled, with three more from 501 and 87 Squadrons and nine from 213 Squadron near Exeter. None arrived in time to stop the attack on Portland at 11:53 GMT but little damage was done and only one vessel was damaged.|$|E

500|$|The pilot director, David Nutter, {{was looking}} through {{pictures}} of actors <b>and</b> <b>stumbled</b> on Tom Welling's image. When {{he asked about}} Welling, the casting director said Welling's manager did {{not want him to}} do the role because it could hurt his feature film career. After a conversation with Welling's manager, Nutter got Welling to read the script for the pilot, which convinced him to do the part. Welling's initial fears were quelled after reading the script, when he realized that the show was not about Clark [...] "... being a super hero ...," [...] but more about the character attempting to live a normal life as a teenager.|$|E
500|$|Josh Scherr, {{leader of}} the Drake's Fortune story {{sequence}} team, said that they created Drake as an [...] "ordinary guy" [...] with no special powers. Instead, Drake became visibly nervous at times, barely cleared objects while jumping, <b>and</b> <b>stumbled</b> while running. The characterizations were meant to show Drake as a frail character. He is not a master of hand-to-hand combat, and throws punches without style or skill. Sam Thompson, producer of Among Thieves, described Drake's martial arts abilities as [...] "fallible." [...] Sony Entertainment of America line producer Sam Thompson mused that Naughty Dog had created iconic characters before, including Crash Bandicoot. With Nathan Drake, however, the company wanted to produce a more average character, one who did not possess {{the same amount of}} confidence and who was more realistic and humble.|$|E
500|$|Although the Australian {{positions}} on the eastern track held, the position around Isurava grew untenable and the 2/14th's commanding officer, Key, requested permission to withdraw to the Isurava rest house, about [...] back along the track. This request was granted and the withdrawal was completed by early morning of 30 August. The defenders then dug in around the new location. As the Japanese brought up more artillery and began a heavy bombardment of the Isurava rest house, the 1/144th established itself around Isurava and began firing on the new Australian position. Meanwhile, the 3/144th emerged from the thick scrub <b>and</b> <b>stumbled</b> upon the Australian flank and rear. Hand-to-hand and close quarters fighting ensued. As Australian casualties mounted and ammunition ran low, the Japanese also came close to making a breakthrough on the alternative track. Horii had now deployed several companies on the flanks and near {{the rear of the}} 2/14th and 39th Battalions, threatening the Australian positions with encirclement. Consequently, late on 30 August, Potts decided that if he remained in location his command would be destroyed, and so he ordered a withdrawal south of Alola towards Eora village.|$|E

500|$|Booth {{made his}} stage debut at age 17 on August 14, 1855, in the {{supporting}} {{role of the}} Earl of Richmond in Richard III at Baltimore's Charles Street Theatre. The audience jeered at the inexperienced actor when he missed some of his lines. He also began acting at Baltimore's Holliday Street Theater, owned by John T. Ford, where the Booths had performed frequently. In 1857, Booth joined the stock company of the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he played for a full season. At his request, he was billed as [...] "J.B. Wilkes", a pseudonym meant to avoid comparison {{with other members of}} his famous thespian family. Jim Bishop wrote that Booth [...] "developed into an outrageous scene stealer, but he played his parts with such heightened enthusiasm that the audiences idolized him." [...] In February 1858, he played in Lucrezia Borgia at the Arch Street Theatre. On opening night, he experienced stage fright <b>and</b> <b>stumbled</b> over his line. Instead of introducing himself by saying, [...] "Madame, I am Petruchio Pandolfo", he stammered, [...] "Madame, I am Pondolfio Pet—Pedolfio Pat—Pantuchio Ped—dammit!

500|$|Subsequently, {{at around}} 16:00, the 603rd was {{regrouping}} outside the minefield {{when it was}} attacked by a company of tanks from Kibrit East (codenamed Putzer by the Israelis), a fortification of the Bar Lev located on the Bitter Lake. The battalion had been reinforced with a tank hunting detachment from the 7th Division, and managed to destroy two tanks and three armored vehicles before the Israelis withdrew. Afterwards, its original assignment was canceled and it was ordered to capture the Kibrit East position (Fort Putzer). It occupied the abandoned position on October 9 which the battalion—despite being cut off and coming under numerous attacks—held {{for the remainder of}} the war. As for the 602nd battalion, it began to move eastwards some time after dusk, <b>and</b> <b>stumbled</b> upon an Israeli battalion of 35 tanks along Artillery Road, some [...] from the Bitter Lake. The battalion's ten PT-76s with 76mm guns were outmatched and outnumbered by the heavier Israeli M48 Pattons with 105mm guns. The manually guided Saggers were difficult to operate at night, and Israeli tanks were employing blinding xenon floodlights. Caught in the open Sinai desert, the 602nd was defeated and lost many of its tanks and armored vehicles, along with significant casualties. The remaining troops retreated to Third Army lines. Some units may have reached their objectives, although this is disputed.Hammad, p.141, Dupuy, p.416.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Beck {{caught a}} bus to New York City {{with little more than}} eight dollars and a guitar. He spent the summer {{attempting}} to find a job and a place to live with little success. Beck eventually began to frequent Manhattan's Lower East Side <b>and</b> <b>stumbled</b> upon {{the tail end of the}} East Village's anti-folk scene's first wave. Beck became involved in a loose posse of acoustic musicians—including Cindy Lee Berryhill, Kirk Kelly, Paleface, and Lach, headed by Roger Manning—whose raggedness and eccentricity placed them well outside the acoustic mainstream. [...] "The whole mission was to destroy all the clichés and make up some new ones," [...] said Beck of his New York years. [...] "Everybody knew each other. You could go up onstage and say anything, and you wouldn't feel weird or feel any pressure." [...] Inspired by that freedom and by the local spoken-word performers, Beck began to write free-associative, surrealistic songs about pizza, MTV, and working at McDonald's, turning mundane thoughts into songs. Beck was roommates with Paleface, sleeping on his couch and attending open mic nights together. Daunted by the prospect of another homeless New York winter, Beck returned to his home of Los Angeles in early 1991. [...] "I was tired of being cold, tired of getting beat up," [...] he later remarked. [...] "It was hard to be in New York with no money, no place I kinda used up all the friends I had.
