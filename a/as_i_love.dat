Listen, the movie’s not perfect but ... I just cannot fathom it. It was a good movie, you guys." ...|$|E

'When Marion went away, {{she wrote}} me, here, {{that you had}} once left her a sacred trust to me, and that now she left you, Alfred, such a trust in my hands: praying and beseeching me, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> her, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> you, not to reject the affection she {{believed}} (she knew, she said) you would transfer to me when the new wound was healed, but to encourage and return it.' ...|$|R

500|$|I Love Bees developer, 42 Entertainment, {{was founded}} by Jordan Weisman, the former {{creative}} director for Microsoft's Xbox division. 42 Entertainment had previously created the first ARG, The Beast, which {{had been used to}} promote the movie A.I.. Other members of the I Love Bees team included Sean Stewart, a World Fantasy Award-award-winning author who served <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> Bees writer, and Jim Stewartson, I Love Bees technical lead who produced the first commercial 3D game delivered by the internet. Weisman stated that the goal of I Love Bees was to utilize every person who interacted with the game, and to use any electronic resource to do so: [...] "If we could make your toaster print something we would. Anything with an electric current running through it. A single story, a single gaming experience, with no boundaries. A game that is life itself." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "This episode will strike a chord with anyone that's ever tried {{to fit in with}} the crowd [...] Lisa gets to show the many facets of her character, and there's a superb slapstick sequence as Homer tries to dispose of a firework." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times praised the episode and said: [...] "The episode is quite simply my favourite Lisa episode regardless of season. From calm to cool and fiercely aggressive, we've rarely seen Lisa so enticing as we do here, and the episode's many elements including the side stories for the other family members culminate in one of the finest this season has to offer." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that he likes how it addresses Bart's resentment of Lisa's popularity. [...] "Granted, it makes [...] a little too mean, but it's entertaining", he added. Jacobson went on to say: [...] "Marge gets the best moment again, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> watching her non-violent approach to the bumper cars." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best parts of the episode to be the scenes that feature Milhouse, particularly his yearbook message to Lisa and the scene with the Mystery Date board game. She concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of A.|$|E
60|$|Ione. Ione, your Highness. Ah, yes; {{she was too}} kind. She never spake a cruel word, nor chid me for my many faults. Never can <b>I</b> <b>love</b> another <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> my gentle mistress.|$|R

500|$|The adult {{interest}} in the show is {{comparable to that of}} The Magic Roundabout, Tiny Toon Adventures, Rocko's Modern Life, Animaniacs, Dexters Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, SpongeBob SquarePants, Yo Gabba Gabba!, and Phineas and Ferb: older audiences appreciate jokes aimed at adult viewers and a sense of nostalgia for older cartoons and animated films. Many of the aforementioned shows had attracted college-aged fans who, when Friendship Is Magic was airing, would be raising children of their own. The show references works that older viewers would recognize, such <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> Lucy, The Benny Hill Show, X-Men, , Diamond Dogs, The Big Lebowski, The Avengers, Star Wars, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Most of these fans are surprised by their fondness for the show. Shaun Scotellaro, operator of Equestria Daily, one of the main fan websites for the show, said, [...] "Honestly, if someone were to have told me I'd be writing a pony blog seven months ago, I would have called them insane." [...] He commented that the spread among adults was accelerated by its presence in online gaming. Mike Fahey, an editor for the gaming website Kotaku, noted that the fandom was [...] "building friendships among a diverse group of people that otherwise might have just sat {{on either side of the}} Internet, flinging insults at each other". Dr. Patrick Edwards, who performed several [...] "Brony Studies" [...] to survey and analyze the fandom, observed that the brony fandom is unlike most other fandoms which [...] "aren't welcoming to people who are different", and promote the show's message of love and tolerance. [...] Further interest came from the furry community, which includes a large number of animation fans. One contributor to [...] "The Brony Study" [...] (below), Dr. Marsha Redden said that the adult fans are [...] "a reaction to the US having been engrossed in terrorism for past ten years" [...] in a manner similar to the Cold War, and are [...] "tired of being afraid, tired of angst and animosity"; the show and its fandom are outlets from those strifes. She compared the brony fandom to that of the bohemian and beatniks after World War II and of the hippies after the Vietnam War. In a similar vein, Amy Keating Rogers, one of the show's writers, believes that the fans have come to like Friendship Is Magic due to [...] "so much cynicism and negativity out there in so many [...] shows", while the show [...] "has such a positive message" [...] that counters this.|$|E

2500|$|John Adams, 2nd President of the United States, stated why he {{relied on}} the laws of Moses over Greek {{philosophy}} for establishing the United States Constitution: [...] "As much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>love,</b> esteem, and admire the Greeks, I believe the Hebrews have done more to enlighten and civilize the world. Moses did more than all their legislators and philosophers. [...] Swedish historian Hugo Valentin credited Moses as the [...] "first to proclaim the rights of man." ...|$|E

She can barely control her sadness and tears; she tells him repeatedly of her unconditional love (Violetta: Amami, Alfredo, amami quant'io t'amo – [...] "Love me, Alfredo, love me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> you"). Before rushing out and setting off for Paris, she hands the farewell letter to her servant to give to Alfredo.|$|E
2500|$|Back at the Cullen home, Alice glimpses the future, seeing Edward and Bella {{together}} with Jacob and a fully matured Renesmee also together. Edward reads Alice's mind and feels relieved that Renesmee has Jacob to protect her.

60|$|Never, never, had <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> Dora {{so deeply}} and truly, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> her that night. When we had again alighted, and were {{walking in the}} starlight along the quiet road {{that led to the}} Doctor's house, I told Agnes it was her doing.|$|R

2500|$|On {{the role}} of writing in her life, she says: [...] "I think of writing simply in terms of pleasure. It's the most {{important}} thing in my life, making things. Much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> my husband and my children, I love them only because I am the person who makes these things. I, who I am, is the person that has the project of making a thing. Well, that's putting it pompously – but constructing. I do see it in sort of three-dimensional structures. And because that person does that all the time, that person is able to love all these people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Guicciardini served three popes over {{a period}} of twenty years, and perhaps because of his experiences, he was highly {{critical}} of the papacy: [...] "I don't know anyone who dislikes the ambition, the avarice, and the sensuality of priests more than I do.... Nevertheless, the position I have enjoyed with several popes has forced me to love their greatness for my own self-interest. If it weren't for this consideration, I would have loved Martin Luther as much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> myself—not to be released from the laws taught by the Christian religion as it is normally interpreted and understood, but to see this band of ruffians reduced within their correct bounds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Less than 24 {{hours after}} the club had been relegated, Defoe made a written request for a transfer, saying, [...] "As much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> West Ham United I feel that now is {{the right time for}} me to move on in my career. This is very much a career decision. I am very ambitious and hungry to achieve {{at the highest levels of}} the game for both club and country." [...] The timing of his request, however, drew {{criticism}} from both fans and teammates and was turned down by the club. He later apologised to supporters, saying, [...] "I mishandled that move and I can only apologise. I'm young and I've learned from it. I still played my hardest for West Ham and gave them 100% and want to thank the fans for their support." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Muslim world, {{support of}} Israel is mostly met with opposition.

Schemel had expressed a desire to record with Love, Erlandson and Auf der Maur stating [...] "nothing has been discussed, but I have a feeling." [...] After the screening, the four took part in a Q session where Love stated: [...] "For me, as much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> playing with Patty – and I would play with her in five seconds again, and everyone onstage – if it's not moving forward, I don't wanna do it.
