40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to the issue of intoxication in children. <b>Acute</b> <b>accidental</b> <b>intoxication</b> appears to be especially relevant for pediatric practice. Drugs, various chemicals frequently used in everyday life and in farming, as well as animal poisons, including snake poisons, may have a toxic effect on children. Specialists of professional associations of physicians “Russian Society of Emergency Medicine” and pediatricians “Union of Pediatricians of Russia” formulated and briefly described the main causes of acute intoxication in children, clinical manifestations and the most significant laboratory indicators of toxic manifestations for various substances, as well as therapy principles and algorithms for such conditions in compliance with principles of the evidence-based medicine. The article presents pathognomonic symptoms and peculiarities of drug intoxication, provides a description of mediator symptoms of intoxication with various substances, as well as the symptoms that may indicate toxic effect. The article contains a description of principles of correction of vital body functions, measures for removing toxic substances from the body and information on the main antidotes. Special attention is given to the most frequent types of intoxication (with organic acids, lye, naphazoline, paracetamol, snake poisons [viper bite]). The article lists stage of medical care rendering to children suffering from acute intoxication and presents prognosis and further management of pediatric patients suffering from such conditions.   </div...|$|E

5000|$|On September 3, 1970, Wilson {{was found}} dead on a {{hillside}} behind bandmate Bob Hite's Topanga Canyon home; he was 27 years old. An autopsy identified his manner and cause of death as <b>accidental</b> <b>acute</b> barbiturate <b>intoxication.</b> Wilson reportedly had attempted suicide a few months earlier, attempting to drive his car off a freeway in Los Angeles. He was briefly hospitalized for significant depression, and was released after a few weeks. Although his death is sometimes reported as a suicide, this is not clearly established and he left no note. Wilson's death came just {{two weeks before the}} death of Jimi Hendrix and four weeks before the death of Janis Joplin, two artists who also died at the same age.Along with his talent and intellect, Wilson had a reputation for social awkwardness and introversion which may have contributed to his depression.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Risk {{factors for}} suicide and fatal <b>accidental</b> <b>intoxication</b> are {{extensively}} studied, while {{risk factors for}} intoxications/injuries of undetermined intent are less well known. The latter have shown an overlap with suicides, but also with fatal <b>accidental</b> <b>intoxications.</b> The objective was to analyze potential differences and similarities in the patterns of risk factors for <b>accidental</b> <b>intoxications,</b> injuries/intoxications with undetermined intent, and suicides, respectively. METHODS: A follow-up register study was conducted, using data from ASI interviews with clients {{in the criminal justice}} system in Sweden (n= 6744), followed in the National Causes of Death Register. A set of risk factors from the ASI interview were tested in bivariate analysis with the respective cause of death, yielding significant risk factors further analyzed in three Cox regression models. RESULTS: In Cox regression analyses, death from fatal <b>accidental</b> <b>intoxication</b> was associated with male gender (HR 4. 09), use of heroin (HR 2. 86), and use of cannabis (HR 1. 94), and death from intoxication/injury of undetermined intent was associated with use of heroin (HR 3. 48), binge drinking of alcohol (HR 2. 46) and previous psychiatric hospitalization (HR 2. 41), while negatively associated with depression (HR 0. 33). Death from suicide was associated with previous suicide attempts (HR 2. 78) and use of sedatives (HR 2. 17). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of criminal justice clients with reported substance use problems, fatal injuries/intoxications with undetermined intent - like fatal <b>accidental</b> <b>intoxications</b> - appear to be associated with substance use variables, and cannot readily be assumed to represent the same background factors as suicide...|$|R
40|$|The {{case history}} and {{toxicological}} {{findings of a}} fatal multi-drug overdose involving metaxalone (Skelaxin) are presented. Gas-liquid chromatography with flame-ionization detection and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry {{were used to determine}} the following drug concentrations (rag/L) in aortic blood: 19 mg/L metaxalone; 190 mg/L acetaminophen; 0. 28 mg/L hydrocodone; and < 0. 1 mg/L diazepam, nordiazepam, amilriplyline, and nortriptyline. The following concentrations of metaxalone were reported in alternate specimens: 17 mg/L in femoral blood; 44 mg/L in bile; 70 mg/kg in liver; 7 mg/L in urine; 202 mg/kg in gastric contents; and 14 mg/L in vitreous humor. These concentrations were determined using both direct extraction and the method of standard addition. The quantitative results obtained by both procedures were in good agreement. Because of the limited information published on metaxalone toxicity, the pathologist assigned the manner and cause of death as <b>accidental</b> <b>acute</b> hydrocodone <b>intoxication.</b> Four additional cases in which metaxalone was present were analyzed for comparison. Two cases were probable drug-related eaths and had rnetaxalone aorta blood concentrations of 18 and 11 mg/L.

40|$|Research of the Consumer and Safety Foundation (SCV) has {{revealed}} that approximately 1850 children, aged 0 to 5 years needed to be hospitalised each year following <b>accidental</b> <b>intoxication.</b> The National Poisons Control Centre (NVIC) of the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) receives approximately 10, 000 information requests per year concerning children aged 0 to 6 years who {{have been exposed to}} xenobiotics. In most of these intoxications medicines, household products or cosmetics were involved. Despite the introduction of guidelines on childproof packaging of medicines and household chemicals, intoxications with childproof products frequently occur. The SCV and NVIC (initiated by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport) therefore started a study to establish how the frequency of <b>accidental</b> <b>intoxications</b> in children could be diminished and what specific measures would be needed to reach this goal. The first phase of the study consisted of: a literature search on risk factors of <b>accidental</b> <b>intoxications</b> in children; interviews with parents of intoxicated children to acquire information on the circumstances of exposure, and an analysis of the NVIC database on poisonings to discover which products are most frequently involved in causing exposure in children. On the basis of the data obtained, an estimate was made of the compounds and product groups considered the most hazardous and therefore requiring further analysis into the circumstances of exposure.

40|$|Objective: <b>Acute</b> <b>accidental</b> {{poisoning}} {{in children}} {{is still an}} important public health problem. The epidemiological investigation specific for each country is necessary {{to determine the extent}} and characteristics of the problem. The aim of our study was to elucidate the current pattern of acute poisoning among children. Methods: The present retrospective study describes the epidemiology of <b>acute</b> <b>accidental</b> poisoning in children (less than 10 years old) admitted to the Emergency Department of two teaching hospitals during a period of two years. Findings: Three hundred and forty four children under 10 years old were admitted to emergency department of two teaching hospitals due to <b>acute</b> <b>accidental</b> poisoning. Drugs were the most common agents causing the poisoning (58. 1 %), followed by Hydrocarbons (13. 1 %), and opioids (9. 3 %). Common signs were neurological (42. 6 %) with lethargy being the most common (39. 1 %). 50. 6 % of cases were discharged from hospital within 6 - 12 hours, 91. 6 % of them without any complication. Conclusion: Accidental poisonings are still a significant cause of morbidity among children in developing countries. Regarding the high prevalence of pharmaceutical drug poisoning and because lethargic was the most frequent neurological sign, comprehensive toxicology screen tests should be included as part of the routine evaluation of children presenting to an ED with an apparent life-threatening event...|$|R

500|$|<b>Accidental</b> <b>intoxication</b> {{of humans}} by [...] mad honey {{has been well}} {{documented}} by several Classical authors, notably Xenophon, while the deliberate use of such honey as a medicine and intoxicant (even hallucinogen) is still practiced by the Gurung tribe of Nepal, who have a long tradition of hazardous cliff-climbing to wrest the precious commodity from the nests of Apis dorsata laboriosa, the giant Himalayan honeybee. The honey thus collected by the Gurung owes its inebriating properties to the nectar which the giant bees gather from a deep red-flowered species of Rhododendron, which, in turn, owes its toxicity to the compound grayanotoxin, widespread in the plant family Ericaceae, to which the genus Rhododendron belongs.|$|R

40|$|Background: Exposure {{to heavy}} metals leads to {{functional}} and metabolic disturbances {{and many of}} them are included in pathogenesis of common diseases (arterial hypertension, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative processes). In this context new therapeutic and prophylactic strategies are necessary. Patients diagnosed with chronic heavy metals intoxication usually require chelation to increase mobilisation of metals from tissues and elimination of them via urine. Acute poisoning with toxic metal may be difficult to diagnosis, especially in case of <b>accidental</b> <b>intoxication</b> or suicidal intention. Patients also require chelation after causative factor is identified. Objectives: To describe some problems connected with toxicity of metals poisoning and to review pharmacologic therapies that could have a role in poisoning with metals. Methods: A review of the literature was carried out and expert opinion expressed. Results/conclusion: Chelation is a common therapy in case of poisoning with toxic metals but it is satisfied only partially. A combined therapy with structurally different chelators or long-term acting chelators could become viable alternatives in the future. A combined therapy with an antioxidant plus chelator may be a good choice in patients chronically poisoned with metals. Exposure to lead should be taken into account during estimation of global cardiovascular risk...|$|R
40|$|In 1988 the National Poisons Control Centre (NVIC) of the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) {{analysed}} reported expositions to xenobiotics {{to establish}} the frequency of <b>accidental</b> <b>intoxication</b> in adolescents, adults and older persons. Adults were involved in 72 % of the approximately 20, 000 information requests on exposition to xenobiotics. In most (63 %) of the intoxication cases, medicines were ingested. Alcohol, drugs and tobacco, and household and industrial products were involved in 21 % of the cases. Exposure to pesticides, plants, mushrooms and cosmetics was limited. Some new medicines were highly frequent in intoxication cases after their introduction. Look-alike packages of some "non-food" products, of which the appearance resembles a "food product", increasingly lead to erroneous use and unintended exposure. New illicit drugs can suddenly become available and the revival of old products, like gammahydroxybutyrate, used in a different manner caused severe intoxications.

40|$|The high acute {{toxicity}} of acrylonitrile {{may be a}} result of its intrinsic biological reactivity or of its metabolite cyanide. Intravenous N-acetylcysteine has been recommended for treatment of <b>accidental</b> <b>intoxications</b> in acrylonitrile workers, but such recommendations vary internationally. Acrylonitrile is metabolized in humans and experimental animals via two competing pathways; the glutathione-dependent pathway is considered to represent an avenue of detoxication whilst the oxidative pathway leads to a genotoxic epoxide, cyanoethylene oxide, and to elimination of cyanide. Cases of acute acrylonitrile overexposure or intoxication have occurred within persons having industrial contact with acrylonitrile; the route of exposure was by inhalation and/or by skin contact. The combined observations lead to the conclusion of a much higher impact of the oxidative metabolism of acrylonitrile in humans than in rodents. This is confirmed by differences in the clinical picture of acute life-threatening intoxications in both species, as well as by differential efficacies of antidotes. A combination of N-acetylcysteine with sodium thiosulfate seems an appropriate measure for antidote therapy of acute acrylonitrile intoxications. Clinical observations also highlight the practical importance of human individual susceptibility differences. Furthermore, differential adduct monitoring, assessing protein adducts with different rates of decay, enables the development of more elaborated biological monitoring strategies for the surveillance of workers with potential acrylonitrile contact...|$|R
