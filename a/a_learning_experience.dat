The publication was shut down after it published a controversial poll of readers' most respected figures; the poll showed the Islamic prophet Muhammad at number 10, below the dangdut singer Rhoma Irama.|$|E
5|$|Lindenwood University has {{a number}} of student media outlets that serve the campus and {{surrounding}} communities of St. Charles County. The official student newspaper is The Legacy. The paper is published every Tuesday. The university hosts a student-operated educational cable station, known as LUTV. It is available on Charter Cable and on AT U-Verse throughout Greater St. Louis, as well as streaming live online. LUTV runs educational and cultural, and LU athletic programming and serves as <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> for communications students. 89.1 The Wood is an FCC-licensed college radio station broadcasting on KCLC-89.1 in the St. Louis Metro Area. The station is student-operated and offers music, news, sports, and specialty programs. The Wood broadcasts from the KCLC studio in the Spellmann Student Center.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, actress Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) auditions {{for a role}} she {{believes}} is for a college freshman on Gossip Girl. At the audition, Jenna learns that she is actually booked to audition {{for the role of}} the college freshman's mother. She panics, believing that this is a sign that she is no longer young, and in an attempt to reclaim her youth, begins acting young which causes the TGS writing staff to mock her. At the same time, movie star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) decides to add a woman to his entourage as <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> when he and his wife, Angie (Sherri Shepherd), have a daughter. He brings in the French-Dutch TGS writer Sue Laroche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway). Tracy later loses his temper with a crew member, thinking that he made a suggestive comment about Sue, causing NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) to tell Tracy that he has become paternal towards Sue. Soon after, Sue begins rebelling against him, as Tracy treats her as a child.|$|E

5|$|The 2006–07 {{season was}} <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> {{for the young}} Arsenal squad and Fàbregas. The club again failed to secure any major honours and were {{defeated}} by city rivals Chelsea in the League Cup Final. Fàbregas, however, {{emerged as one of}} the key creative players for the team, playing in every single league game. He kick-started Arsenal's 2006–07 UEFA Champions League campaign when he scored a brace in a 3–0 win over Dinamo Zagreb in a qualifier match. In the Premier League, he notched up 13 assists, which was the second-highest total in the league. He ended the season with several individual honours, including the Golden Boy award, presented by the Italian paper TuttoSport, based on a poll of leading writers across Europe. He was also named in the 2006 UEFA Team of the Year, and named FA Premier League Player of the Month for January 2007. Additionally, he was nominated for both PFA Players' Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year, although both awards went to Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo. In June 2007, he was named Arsenal's Player of the Season, taking in 60% of the votes.|$|E

25|$|This Test was {{the second}} meeting of the two sides in {{international}} cricket; Sri Lanka beat Bangladesh in an ODI during the 1997 Asia Cup. Prior to this match, Bangladesh had lost four Test matches in a row, and their coach Trevor Chappell was expecting this Test to be <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> for the side rather than an opportunity to win their first match. Following Bangladesh's batting collapse in the first match of the championship against Pakistan {{at the hands of}} leg spinner Danish Kaneria, Bangladesh was expected to perform better with the bat, especially against the in-form Muralitharan who took 23 wickets in 3 Tests against India.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{published}} research conducted in Second Life {{is associated with}} education and learning.

One such study tested the usefuleness of SL as an action learning environment in a senior course for management information systems students. Another presented a case study in which university students were tasked with building an interactive learning experience using SL as a platform. Both problem-based learning and constructionism acted as framing pedagogies for the task, with students working in teams to design and build <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> which could be possible in real life.|$|E

25|$|Several {{years prior}} to {{recording}} People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm, group member Q-Tip created much of the album's production on pause tapes {{when he was in}} the 10th grade. He would have his first studio experience while recording with Jungle Brothers on their debut album Straight out the Jungle (1988). Although this was <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experience,</b> he acquired more recording and producing knowledge being present at all of De La Soul’s 3 Feet High and Rising (1989) sessions. Recording engineer Shane Faber taught Q-Tip how to use equipment such as the E-mu SP-1200 and Akai S950 samplers, and soon-after, renowned producer Large Professor taught him how to use other equipment, for which he would expand upon on People’s Instinctive Travels.|$|E
25|$|Kwan {{looked at}} the 2005 Worlds as <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> in the ISU Judging System. She {{continued}} to train and stated that she would attempt {{to qualify for the}} 2006 Olympic Games in Turin, Italy. However, following a hip injury, she was forced to withdraw from her three planned competitions in the fall of 2005. Kwan skated her new short program ("Totentanz") at a made-for-TV event in December 2005, but her performance was well below her usual standard. On January 4, 2006, Kwan withdrew from the U.S. Figure Skating Championships with an abdominal injury incurred in December 2005. One week later, she filed a petition with the USFSA for a medical waiver to be placed on the 2006 Olympic figure skating team. On January 14, 2006, after the United States ladies' figure skating event, the USFSA's International Committee met and in a 20 to 3 vote approved Kwan's petition under the stipulation that she show her physical and competitive readiness to a five-member monitoring panel by January 27.|$|E

25|$|Serious {{games are}} games that are {{designed}} primarily to convey information or <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> to the player. Some serious games may even fail to qualify as a video game {{in the traditional sense}} of the term. Educational software does not typically fall under this category (e.g., touch typing tutors, language learning programs, etc.) and the primary distinction would appear {{to be based on the}} title's primary goal as well as target age demographics. As with the other categories, this description is more of a guideline than a rule. Serious games are games generally made for reasons beyond simple entertainment and as with the core and casual games may include works from any given genre, although some such as exercise games, educational games, or propaganda games may have a higher representation in this group due to their subject matter. These games are typically designed to be played by professionals as part of a specific job or for skill set improvement. They can also be created to convey social-political awareness on a specific subject.|$|E
