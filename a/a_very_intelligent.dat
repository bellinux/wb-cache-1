Another version of this is that Sraffa bought the bonds during the war, when they were trading at distressed prices, as he was convinced that Japan would honour its obligations (Nicholas Kaldor, pp.66–67).|$|E

Even so, most scholars did not engage in much serious discussion or analysis of the novel until the 1950s, though many in France recognized the work much earlier.

500|$|Observers {{commented that}} California Chrome {{appears to be}} <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>intelligent</b> horse, as he expresses curiosity about {{everything}} around him. His idiosyncrasies, included a fondness for one specific brand of horse cookies. [...] His tendency to perform a flehmen response for no obvious reason, particularly when being bathed, prompted the press to claim that he is [...] "smiling". He will deliberately stop and put his ears forward to [...] "pose" [...] for cameras when he hears them clicking. As Alan Sherman explained, [...] "He's a ham"; and exercise rider Willie Delgado gave him an additional nickname, [...] "Vogue". As a younger horse, notably in 2014, he would not walk forward out of horse vans designed for a forward exit; he would only back out, a quirk discovered by the press {{when he was first}} unloaded off of an airplane. At the Sherman stables, he had a green tetherball in his stall to play with, but his worst bad habit is that he sometimes bites.|$|E

500|$|In the Church's mythology, Jehovah1 had {{intended}} for Dobbs {{to lead a}} powerful conspiracy and brainwash individuals to make them work for a living. Dobbs refused to support the group; instead, he infiltrated it and organized a counter-movement. Church leaders teach that he was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>intelligent</b> child and, as he grew older, studied several religious traditions, including Sufism, Rosicrucianism, and the Fourth Way. Another key event in his life occurred when he traveled to Tibet; there he learned vital truths about topics including Yetis. The Church teaches that Yetis exist, and that SubGenius members have descended from them. The only relative of Dobbs that the Church identifies is his mother, Jane McBride Dobbs—Church leaders cite his lack of resemblance to his mother's husband {{as the reason for}} not revealing his father. Dobbs is married to a woman named Connie; SubGenius leaders identify the couple as archetypes of the genders in a belief that resembles Hindu doctrines about Shiva and Parvati. Church literature has variously described Dobbs' occupation as [...] "drilling equipment" [...] or fluoride sales, and accounts of his life generally emphasize his good fortune rather than intelligence. SubGenius leaders believe that he is capable of time travel, and that this ability results in occasional changes to doctrine, deemed the [...] "Sacred Doctrine of Erasability" [...] by the Church. Consequently, members attempt to follow Dobbs by eschewing unchangeable plans.|$|E

Lonsdale was subpoenaed by the Church of Scientology for a deposition in the fall of 2006, and the Church claimed that he belonged to an anti-Scientology group which had previously been barred from protesting in certain areas in downtown Clearwater, the Lisa McPherson Trust. Luke Lirot, the lawyer who defended Lonsdale in the matter, told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "I found him to be quite affable and truly <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>intelligent</b> man ... I certainly hope that a very thorough investigation is conducted." [...] In his deposition, Lonsdale stated he was unemployed and began to educate himself about Scientology while working on a photography project on homeless people in Clearwater. After reading more about Scientology, he decided to shed light on the organization and irritate Scientologists. Of the claims Scientology made that Lonsdale was affiliated with the Lisa McPherson Trust, Lirot commented: [...] "It was obvious to everybody {{he had nothing to do}} with the trust, and the trust had been disbanded and dissolved many years prior ... They just wanted to try to come up with a way to preclude him from exercising his right to picket in downtown Clearwater, and they were unsuccessful in doing that." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Schur {{said another}} {{goal of the}} third season was to better {{demonstrate}} the comedic abilities of Rashida Jones, whose Ann Perkins character had often been portrayed as a straight man role to the other characters. This was done by placing Jones in a romantic relationship with Rob Lowe's character Chris Traeger, who is so overly-optimistic and seemingly-perfect that Ann has trouble finding any flaws and is taken aback by him. Schur said: [...] "Rashida is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>intelligent</b> and attractive woman, and it's hard to knock someone like that off balance. And the way to knock that person off balance is to get Rob Lowe {{in a relationship with}} you." [...] Ann is further taken out of her element when it is revealed in [...] "Indianapolis" [...] that Chris broke up with her, but did so in such a positive and upbeat way that Ann did not realize it for several days. Afterward, Ann continues to move away her previous straight man role by going on a string of dates with many random men. During the final episodes of the season, Ann takes a part-time job at city hall as the health department public relations director, which Schur described as [...] "the natural full circle {{from the beginning of the}} season". This marked her process of getting over Chris and becoming a [...] "more mature person". Schur also said having Ann work at city hall would make it easier to integrate her into storylines with the other characters.|$|E
500|$|Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur said Chris' {{habit of}} {{pointing}} {{directly into the}} faces of people he meets and repeating their names {{was one of the}} first elements of his character that the writing staff conceived. Chris' desire to live 150 years was inspired by Schur's wife, J. J. Philbin, who had read an article which stated that scientists believe the first human who will live 150 years has already been born, and felt it applied to the Chris Traeger character. Lowe's first day of filming on the series was his birthday (March 17, 2010), which was the day his kiss scene with Rashida Jones in [...] "The Master Plan" [...] was shot. Lowe said he loved his character's [...] "unrelenting enthusiasm" [...] and the fact that he is not a romantic lead, but rather a [...] "big, fat nerd". Parks and Recreation star Amy Poehler said of Chris Traeger: [...] "It's a really fun character to play against because what you’ll see start to happen is Chris doesn’t want to deliver any bad news, but he’s actually like the Bad News Bear." [...] Like much of the rest of the cast, Lowe occasionally improvises lines and actions for his character that are not included in the script. The writers hoped to use Ann Perkins' breakup with Chris, and the drastic changes in her behavior afterward, as a way of tapping into more comedic potential of her character rather than having her fill the role of straight man as she had in the past. Schur said: [...] "Ann is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>intelligent</b> and attractive woman, and it's hard to knock someone like that off balance. And the way to knock that person off balance is to get Rob Lowe in a relationship with you." ...|$|E
