5|$|Hellcats follows Marti Perkins, a pre-law {{college student}} at Lancer University, {{who lost her}} {{scholarship}} and has no other choice but to join the college's cheer squad, the Hellcats, {{in order to obtain}} a new one. There she meets her new roommate and team captain Savannah Monroe, the injured flyer Alice Verdura, her new partner Lewis Flynn and the Hellcats coach Vanessa Lodge who hopes to win nationals, otherwise the cheer leading program will be cut. All the while, Marti <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> deal with her financially unstable and sometimes irresponsible mother, Wanda Perkins, whom she often has to bail out of difficult situations, and her best friend Dan Patch.|$|E
5|$|Hollis {{is a young}} Federal Bureau of Investigation {{special agent}} who becomes a protégée to {{offender}} profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) when he begins working in Virginia. She struggles to understand the criminal mind, as her sister was murdered by a man with no motive. She has an estranged half-sister, Tamra, who has become a heroin addict. Hollis <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> deal with her father's bout with an Alzheimer's-like illness, which has possibly been induced by the Millennium Group—a secretive organisation to which Black had previously belonged, and which he now believes {{to be responsible for}} bioterrorism. Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) uses Hollis' father's illness as leverage to coerce her into cooperating with the Millennium Group.|$|E
5|$|Once woven, the {{material}} {{is sent to the}} BIS laboratories for testing. After quality testing, {{the material}}, if approved, is returned to the factory. It is then separated into three lots which are dyed saffron, white and green. The Ashoka Chakra is screen printed, stencilled or suitably embroidered onto each side of the white cloth. Care <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be taken that the chakra is completely visible and synchronised on both sides. Three pieces of the required dimension, one of each colour, are then stitched together according to specifications and the final product is ironed and packed. The BIS then checks the colours and only then can the flag be sold.|$|E

60|$|Another direct question, and it <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a direct}} answer.|$|R
25|$|Malan <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{appear before}} the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.|$|R
5|$|Spider-Woman is {{a variant}} of Spider-Man and an alternate-universe version of Gwen Stacy. She resides in what Marvel dubs Earth-65, where Gwen Stacy is bitten by a {{radioactive}} spider and becomes a superheroine instead of Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man. The character <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> deal with various enemies, including Earth-65 version of Matt Murdock and Frank Castle. Gwen Stacy's Spider-Woman is depicted as harboring much of Peter's personality and conflicts along with sharing his powers and abilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{property}} <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> {{be within}} a designated or zoned {{area in a}} municipality. Foreigners can not buy in villages.|$|E
25|$|Optimization {{problems}} ask for {{the point}} at which a given function is maximized (or minimized). Often, the point <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> satisfy some constraints.|$|E
50|$|The Liberals <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{contend with}} the early 1980s recession.|$|R
50|$|Malan <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{appear before}} the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.|$|R
5000|$|Children {{attending}} Little MA <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wear [...] "Spirit Wear." ...|$|R
25|$|Equipment Class 3 which <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> {{withstand}} fire or {{flood in}} any one compartment without the system failing.Loss of position should not occur from any single failure including a completely burnt fire sub division or flooded watertight compartment.|$|E
25|$|This {{area has}} to do with logic, abstractions, reasoning, numbers and {{critical}} thinking. This <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do with having the capacity to understand the underlying principles of some kind of causal system. Logical reasoning is closely linked to fluid intelligence and to general intelligence (g factor).|$|E
25|$|The Attorney General's Office is a Constitutional body {{under the}} Constitution of Nepal (2072). For {{a person to}} be {{eligible}} for the post of Attorney General, they <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be qualified to be appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court.|$|E
50|$|Players and/or {{at least}} one of the player's parents or {{grandparents}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been born in Italy. They <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> played {{at least one}} game at VFL/AFL level.|$|R

25|$|Ruggiero {{is taken}} captive by the sorceress Alcina {{and has to}} be freed from her magic island. He <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> avoid the enchantments of his foster father, the wizard Atlante, who does not want him to fight. Finally, Ruggiero {{converts}} to Christianity and marries Bradamante.|$|E
25|$|The job of camp comic {{is given}} to the naive but kind-hearted Spike Dixon, who wants an {{introduction}} to the world of show business. Many episodes involve Ted Bovis attempting to scam the campers as well as the well-meaning Fairbrother, who <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> avoid the romantic approaches of the chief Yellowcoat and sports organiser, Gladys Pugh.|$|E
25|$|In {{an episode}} of the ninth series in 2008, Sylvester McCoy made a guest {{appearance}} where he played a retired actor named Graham Capelli who played a time traveller in a television show called The Lollipop Man where he could travel through time with his traffic lollipop stick. Graham <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> provide commentary for the DVD release of the show.|$|E
25|$|The members under {{compression}} <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{be designed}} to be safe against buckling.|$|R
25|$|The units <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be {{approved}} by the local prefecture authorities before restarting.|$|R
50|$|ADs <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be (re-)considered when modernizing a {{software}} system in software evolution.|$|R
25|$|Observers of {{the primary}} and general {{elections}} compared Obama's design choices favorably to those made by his opponents. In her campaign, Hillary Clinton used New Baskerville, a serif used by book publishers, law firms, and universities, while John McCain used Optima, the same font used for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. It <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be noticed that while the Obama campaign material still used the Perpetua typeface, the short-lived John Edwards campaign was already using Gotham Ultra.|$|E
25|$|The {{alternative}} concept, {{developed in}} {{roughly the same}} time frame was closed-circuit scuba. The body consumes and metabolises {{only a small fraction}} of inhaled oxygen—the situation is even more wasteful of oxygen when the breathing gas is compressed as it is in ambient pressure breathing systems underwater. The rebreather recycles the exhaled breathing gas, while constantly replenishing it from the supply so that the oxygen level does not get depleted. The apparatus <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> remove the exhaled carbon dioxide, as a buildup of CO2 levels would result in respiratory distress and hypercapnia.|$|E
25|$|The open {{platform}} is potentially dangerous, as passengers can board, alight, and {{stand on the}} platform at any time, even with the bus travelling at speed. The presence of a conductor to regulate access to the platform helps, but the conductor <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> collect fares throughout the bus, and even if on the platform cannot prevent all incidents. Former London mayor Ken Livingstone said in 2013 that the Routemasters were too dangerous, with around twelve people per year losing their lives after falling from them during his mayoralty.|$|E
50|$|In 1954, De Gasperi <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{give up the}} {{leadership}} of the party.|$|R
50|$|The members under {{compression}} <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{be designed}} to be safe against buckling.|$|R
50|$|During his papacy he <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{contend with}} the Saracens, who were attacking Lazio.|$|R
25|$|The {{alternative}} concept, {{developed in}} {{roughly the same}} time frame was closed-circuit scuba. The body consumes and metabolises {{only a part of}} the oxygen in the inhaled air at the surface, and an even smaller fraction when the breathing gas is compressed as it is in ambient pressure systems underwater. A rebreather recycles the used breathing gas, while constantly replenishing it from the supply so that the oxygen level does not get dangerously depleted. The apparatus <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> remove the exhaled carbon dioxide, as a buildup of CO2 levels would result in respiratory distress due to hypercapnia.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} such high incarceration rates are also shown in other ways. For example, {{a woman who has}} been {{recently}} released from prison is ineligible for welfare in most states. She is not eligible for subsidized housing, and for Section 8 she has to wait two years before she can apply. In addition to finding housing, she <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> find employment, but most likely she can not find a job because she has a criminal record so no one wants to hire her. Essentially, a woman who has been recently released from prison comes into a society that is not prepared structurally or emotionally to welcome her back.|$|E
25|$|In {{carnivorous}} plants, {{the leaf}} {{is not just}} used to photosynthesise, {{but also as a}} trap. Changing the leaf shape to make it a better trap generally makes it less efficient at photosynthesis. For example, pitchers have to be held upright, so that only their opercula directly intercept light. The plant <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> expend extra energy on non-photosynthetic structures like glands, hairs, glue and digestive enzymes. To produce such structures, the plant requires ATP and respires more of its biomass. Hence, a carnivorous plant will have both decreased photosynthesis and increased respiration, making the potential for growth small and the cost of carnivory high.|$|E
50|$|Independent suspension: The arms <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{transmit}} traction and braking loads, usually accomplished via {{a longitudinal}} link. They <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> control caster. Note that brake torques <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be reacted - either {{by a second}} longitudinal link, or by rotating the hub, which forces the lateral arms out of plane, so allowing them to react 'spin' forces, or by rigidly fixing the longitudinal link to the hub.|$|R
2500|$|The {{movement}} <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> address {{women who}} thought regulations should be reformed rather than abolished.|$|R
50|$|All {{these three}} classes <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{implement}} selection, performed either by humans or by computers.|$|R
