50|$|Malacocoris chlorizans (commonly {{known as}} {{delicate}} <b>apple</b> <b>capsid)</b> is {{a species of}} plant bugs belonging to the family Miridae, subfamily Orthotylinae.|$|R
50|$|The genus Helopeltis, {{also known}} as {{mosquito}} bugs, {{is a group of}} Heteropterans in the family Miridae (<b>capsid</b> <b>bugs).</b> They include important pests of various crops, including cacao, cashew, cotton and tea. Now in a different subgenus, a number of similar Afropeltis species are pests in Africa.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant is}} eaten by various aphids, <b>capsid</b> <b>bugs,</b> earwigs, leaf miners, nematodes, spider mites, thrips, and whiteflies. The plant can die from various {{diseases}} which include aster yellows, Botrytis, leaf spots, rust, powdery mildew, verticillium wilt, and rotting of stem and roots, and even viruses.|$|R
50|$|The mallow {{flea beetle}} (Podagrica fuscicornis) is a pest that makes tiny {{holes in the}} leaves. Cutworms, aphids, and <b>capsid</b> <b>bugs</b> use the plant as a food source in hotter and drier conditions. A number of weevils use A. rosea as their host plant, {{including}} Rhopalapion longirostre, Alocentron curvirostre, and Aspidapion validum.|$|R
25|$|Cocoa trees grow in hot, rainy {{tropical}} {{areas within}} 20° of latitude from the Equator. Cocoa harvest is {{not restricted to}} one period per year and a harvest typically occurs over several months. In fact, in many countries, cocoa can be harvested {{at any time of}} the year. Pesticides are often applied to the trees to combat <b>capsid</b> <b>bugs,</b> and fungicides to fight black pod disease.|$|R
5000|$|The Miridae are a {{large and}} diverse insect family at one time known by the taxonomic synonym Capsidae. Species in the family may be {{referred}} to as <b>capsid</b> <b>bugs</b> or [...] "mirid bugs". Common names include plant bugs, leaf bugs, and grass bugs. It is the largest family of true bugs belonging to the suborder Heteroptera; it includes over 10,000 known species, and new ones are being described constantly. Most widely known mirids are species that are notorious agricultural pests that pierce plant tissues, feed on the sap, and sometimes transmit viral plant diseases. Some species however, are predatory.|$|R
5000|$|Roridula ( [...] ; from Latin roridus [...] "dewy") is a South African genus {{of plants}} {{restricted}} to the Cape Provinces, the sole genus in the family Roridulaceae. Its distribution is threatened due to the farming of rooibos. While having many of the adaptations of a carnivorous plant, such as the possession of insect-trapping sticky hairs, it does not directly digest the animals it traps. Instead, it has a mutualistic relationship with Pameridea roridulae, a species of <b>capsid</b> <b>bug,</b> which lives on the plant and feeds on the trapped insects. The plant obtains nutrients from the droppings of this symbiotic insect. It is sometimes called protocarnivorous.|$|R
25|$|Slugs and snails {{are serious}} pests {{in some parts}} of the world, {{particularly}} in spring when new growth is emerging through the soil. Earwigs can also disfigure the blooms. The other main pests likely to be encountered are aphids (usually on young stems and immature flower buds), red spider mite (causing foliage mottling and discolouration, worse in hot and dry conditions) and <b>capsid</b> <b>bugs</b> (resulting in contortion and holes at growing tips). Diseases affecting dahlias include powdery mildew, grey mould (Botrytis cinerea), verticillium wilt, dahlia smut (Entyloma calendulae f. dahliae), phytophthora and some plant viruses. Dahlias are a source of food for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including angle shades, common swift, ghost moth and large yellow underwing.|$|R
40|$|As a {{prerequisite}} to the elucidation of the sex pheromone of the green <b>capsid</b> <b>bug</b> Lygocoris pabulinus (L.), we studied the bug's reproductive development and behaviour. When kept under long-day conditions (L 18 :D 6) at 25 °C, {{both males and females}} start to copulate 4 days after the final moult. Second matings occur in some females, even on consecutive days. The premating period is 10 min on average and copulation lasts 1 to 2 min. At long range, when males are attracted to traps baited with live females, we did not observe a specific calling position of the females. At short range, a characteristic courtship behaviour of the females was not observed either. Males showed a characteristic vibration of the abdomen, which was repeated several times before copulation. This behaviour {{can be used as a}} bioassay to test potential sex pheromone compounds...|$|R
40|$|This work aims {{to provide}} a first {{detailed}} description of the results obtained in a seasonal abundance study of arthropods in the native pristine humid forest from Terceira Island (Azores). Ten sites were sampled during four years with SLAM (Sea, Land, and Air Malaise) traps targeting several arthropod taxa with good dispersal abilities as well as epigean species crawling into the trap. Samples were taken every three months in nine sites between 2012 and 2016 and monthly in one of the sites between 2014 and 2015. A total of 147 arthropod species and morphospecies were sampled mostly belonging to Hemiptera, Araneae and Coleoptera. Four endemic species, the tree lace-hopper Cixius azoterceirae, the <b>capsid</b> <b>bug</b> Pinalitus oromii, the bristletail Trigoniophthalmus borgesi and a morphospecies of Aleyrodidae accounted for 50 % of all adult specimens. Most species peak in abundance in summer, but monthly data allowed the identification of other seasonal patterns.

40|$|Males of {{the green}} <b>capsid</b> <b>bug,</b> Lygocoris pabulinus, exhibit a {{specific}} courtship behavior, i. e., a vibration of the abdomen. When both live and dead females were offered to males, this vibration behavior was elicited {{in most of the}} males tested. When females were dissected into separate body parts, heads, wings, and legs elicited equal responses, while thorax plus abdomen elicited a much lower response. When separate body parts were extracted, the leg extracts elicited significantly stronger responses than any other extract. This suggests that female L. pabulinus legs are either the source of a close-range sex pheromone or that pheromone is accumulated on the legs due to grooming behavior. The leg extracts contained several hydrocarbons such as n-alkenes, n-alkanes, and some methylalkanes. Female extracts contained more (Z) - 9 -pentacosene and male extracts contained more (Z) - 9 -heptacosene. Substrates on which females had walked elicited similar responses as female legs, indicating that the pheromone is deposited on the substrate. This enlarges the functional range of low-volatility compounds, which are thought to function only when sexes are in close vicinity or in contact...|$|R
40|$|Many pests, {{especially}} <b>capsid</b> <b>bugs,</b> infest cocoa {{and contribute}} to low yields in producing countries. In Ghana, synthetic pesticides are recommended for controlling the insect pests, and a combination of synthetic pesticides and cultural practices for diseases and weeds. However, the farmers in Ghana are not motivated to adopt these recommendations due to {{the high cost of}} pesticides and low producer prices. There is also concern that use of synthetic pesticides on a wide scale can affect both human health and the environment. With the objective of improving cocoa yields through environmentally friendly pest control practices, evaluation of an integrated pest management (IPM) package based on aqueous neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.) seed extracts to control the insect pests and cultural practices to manage the diseases, weeds and parasitic plants was undertaken in farmers' fields with their active participation. The IPM package improved yields significantly and was found to be more profitable than the farmers' practices. However, there are two major constraints to adoption of the package by farmers: it is labour-intensive and currently, neem is not readily available to the community. The study recommends that these constraints must be tackled to motivate the farmers to adopt or adapt the IPM package...|$|R
40|$|The aim is {{to generalize}} the {{scientific}} researches on the species composition of Hemiptera within the Caucasus and possible ways of its formation. Materials and methods. As research materials we used the collections of Hemiptera of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Zoology of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan as well as own collections {{and analysis of the}} available literature data. As the basic tool, we used the method of zoogeographical and ecological analysis of <b>capsid</b> <b>bugs</b> of the Caucasus. We also studied the hemipterofauna of the Mirid bugs of the individual regions of the Caucasus. Findings. The paper presents an analysis of the representation and relation of zoogeographical complexes of Hemiptera insects of Miridae (Heteroptera) family in the vast territories of the North Caucasus and Transcaucasia. The analysis confirmed the major conventional views on the possible ways of forming a complex of Mirid bugs in the Caucasus, although so far the issue has not been studied completely. Conclusion. Based on the analysis of faunal and taxonomic studies, we studied the main features of the zoogeographic structure of the most numerous family of Hemiptera in the region. The hemipterofauna of the Western Transcaucasia is dominated by the boreal complex, and the Transcaucasia is dominated by the Mediterranean complex with {{a significant part of the}} Iran-Turan. Currently, this family consists of around 600 species. Among Mirid bugs, cosmopolitans in this region are rare. In the North Caucasus, there are almost no endemic species, while in the South Caucasus, they account for about 5 % of the total. The role of human factor in the formation of certain complexes is quite high.  </p...|$|R
