40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a pilot project}} for a database of Russian verbal aspect. All prefixed verbs in the database are linked to their base form. Independently of this, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>verbs</b> <b>are</b> classified as either perfective, imperfective or biaspectual, {{and the members of}} a perfective/imperfective opposition with the same derivational base are linked to each other. The linked members can further be classified into aspectual (perfective/imperfective) pairs. To keep the database as theory independent as possible, we establish the relation between the members of an aspectual pair for the largest part semi-automatically, {{on the basis of the}} information provided in their dictionary definitions. The databse is not meant as a model by itself, but it intended to provide empirical grounds for data generalizations which, in turn, can be used to support theoretical explanations. After the description of the database itself, we discuss a number of general claim about Russian aspect, and verify them against the database. Amongst other things, we show that not all prefixed verbs are perfective, and that there is no relation between the meaning of a prefixed за- verb and the presence or absence of a direct object...|$|E

50|$|What sort of name {{shall we}} give to verbs like 'believe' and 'wish' and so forth? I should be {{inclined}} to call them 'propositional verbs'.

Of course you might call them 'attitudes', but I should not like that because it is a psychological term, and although <b>all</b> <b>the</b> instances in our experience are psychological, {{there is no reason to}} suppose that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>verbs</b> I <b>am</b> talking of are psychological.

40|$|Abstract: Both A Practical Ndebele Dictionary (1971) by Pelling and Isichazamazwi SesiNdebele (2001) by Hadebe et al. lemmatize {{a number}} of -wa-ending verbs. Each one of <b>the</b> <b>verbs</b> <b>is</b> easily {{recognizable}} as a canonical or base form from which different word forms can be derived. Indeed they should all be seen as legitimate headwords that have been carefully selected for entry until a keener observation as presented in this article, questions {{the validity of the}} inclusion. It would be understood from both compilers that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>verbs</b> entered <b>are</b> by virtue of their being legitimate <b>verb</b> bases. Since <b>the</b> <b>verbs</b> ending with -wa are canonical forms, they should be inflected with -iw-/-w-, the passive extension morpheme, and by any other extension morphemes. When -iw-/ -w- cannot inflect directly, the usual initial inflection to causative or applicative and then to passive should then apply. When -iw-/-w- cannot apply, {{it is likely that the}} headword in question is in fact a passive form already derived from another base form. The article argues that these words cannot claim to be legitimate headwords. The article further observes that other verb endings treated can be simi-larly tested and treated accordingly. Possibly headword selection will then be more consistent and charac-terized by a more considered and reasoned approach...|$|R

The main difference {{we can see}} between these two languages is that in Spanish we speak about a system. It is not a lexical unit. It has its own fixed rules. The verbal periphrasis is a compound of an auxiliary verb and an indefinite verb (verbum infinitum) - that means of an infinite, participle or gerund. <b>The</b> auxiliary <b>verb</b> <b>is</b> totally grammaticalized (except - comenzar, empezar, principiar). In our work we study the combinations of auxiliary verbs with infinitive. It's impossible to describe <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> verbal periphrasis indeed, so we focused only on the ingressive ones. Firstly we defined {{the character of the}} verbal periphrasis. Then we tried to make a summary of <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>verbs</b> with higher frequency.

5000|$|The Yalunka {{language}} in Guinea is more order sensitive {{than many other}} languages. There is very little affixing that marks grammatical function of a word or requirements of agreement between words in the sentence. There is comparatively little morphology and only minor inflectional affixing. There are not long conjugations of <b>verb</b> tenses. Instead, <b>the</b> language relies on clause order to define the grammatical function of each word. For this reason, the linguistic concept of slots in the clause and phrase structure is effective {{in the description of}} the Yalunka language. [...] The clause structure of the Yalunka language is basically a series of slots. There is the possibility of a Conjunction and Adverb of time {{at the beginning of the}} clause. There is necessarily a subject noun phrase except in the case of imperative constructions. There is then the possibility of an internal adverb thereafter followed by an optionally appearing aspect marker. For transitive verbs, a direct object may appear after the aspect marker which <b>is</b> followed by <b>the</b> <b>verb.</b> <b>The</b> <b>verb</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> minimal utterance of the Yalunka language. e.g. /siga/ Go. <b>The</b> <b>verb</b> may optionally <b>be</b> accompanied by a suffix which does not usually co-occur with the aspect marker (except with /yi/). After <b>the</b> <b>verb</b> there <b>are</b> two different kinds of obliques, one occurring before and one after the /nɛn/ which is a particle shrouded in a respectable degree of mystery. Those obliques occurring before the /nɛn/ tend to relate closely to the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>verb</b> and modify it, while those obliques to the right of /nɛn/ are post positions of location, post positions of time, and adverbs. They come in that order. After the obliques there is another rather limber particle /nun/ and finally a whole class of colorful emphatic markers that bear a much higher tone than the previous words in <b>the</b> sentence. <b>All</b> categories except <b>the</b> <b>verb</b> <b>are</b> optional.|$|R
