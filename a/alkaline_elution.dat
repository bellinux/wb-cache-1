40|$|<b>Alkaline</b> <b>elution</b> is a {{sensitive}} and commonly used technique to detect cellular DNA {{damage in the}} form of DNA strand breaks and DNA cross-links. Conventional <b>alkaline</b> <b>elution</b> procedures have extensive equipment requirements and are tedious to perform. Our laboratory recently presented a rapid, simplified, and sensitive modification of the <b>alkaline</b> <b>elution</b> technique to detect carcinogen-induced DNA strand breaks. In the present study, we have further modified this technique to enable the rapid characterization of chemically induced DNA-interstrand and DNA-protein associated cross-links in cultured epithelial cells. Cells were exposed to three known DNA cross-linking agents, nitrogen mustard (HN 2), mitomycin C (MMC), or ultraviolet irradiation (UV). One hour exposures of HN 2 at 0. 25, 1. 0, and 4. 0 M or of MMC at 20, 40, and 60 M produced a dose-dependent induction of total DNA cross-links by these agents. Digestion with proteinase K revealed that HN 2 and MMC induced both DNA-protein cross-links and DNA-interstrand cross-links. Ultraviolet irradiation induced both DNA cross-links and DNA strand breaks, the latter of which were either protein and nonprotein associated. The results demonstrate that gravity-flow <b>alkaline</b> <b>elution</b> is {{a sensitive}} and accurate method to characterize the molecular events of DNA cross-linking. Using this procedure, elution of DNA from treated cells is completed in 1 hr, and only three fractions per sample are analyzed. This method may be useful as a rapid screening assay for genotoxicity and/or as an adjunct to other predictive assays for potential mutagenic or carcinogenic agents...|$|E

The effect of CaCrO 4 on these parameters was compared with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, an agent known to produce alkali labile sites.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the specificity of}} biological monitoring variables (excretion of phenanthrene and pyrene metabolites in urine) and the usefulness of some biomarkers of effect (<b>alkaline</b> filter <b>elution,</b> 32 P postlabelling assay, measurement of sister chromatid exchange) in workers exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). METHODS: 29 coke oven workers and a standardised control group were investigated for frequencies of DNA single strand breakage, DNA protein cross links (<b>alkaline</b> filter <b>elution</b> assay), sister chromatid exchange, and DNA adducts (32 P postlabelling assay) in lymphocytes. Phenanthrene and pyrene metabolites were measured in 24 hour urine samples. 19 different PAHs (including benzo(a) pyrene, pyrene, and phenanthrene) were measured at the workplace by personal air monitoring. The GSTT 1 activity in erythrocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations in blood was also measured. RESULTS: Concentrations of phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo(a) pyrene in air correlated well with the concentration of total PAHs in air; they {{could be used for}} comparisons of different workplaces if the emission compositions were known. The measurement of phenanthrene metabolites in urine proved to be a better biological monitoring variable than the measurement of 1 -hydroxypyrene. Significantly more DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes of coke oven workers were found (<b>alkaline</b> filter <b>elution</b> assay); the DNA adduct rate was not significantly increased in workers, but correlated with exposure to PAHs in a semiquantitative manner. The number of sister chromatid exchanges was lower in coke oven workers but this was not significant; thus counting sister chromatid exchanges was not a good variable for biomonitoring of coke oven workers. Also, indications for immunotoxic influences (changes in lymphocyte subpopulations) were found. CONCLUSIONS: The measurement of phenanthrene metabolites in urine seems to be a better biological monitoring variable for exposure to PAHs than measurement of hydroxypyrene. The <b>alkaline</b> filter <b>elution</b> assay proved to be the most sensitive biomarker for genotoxic damage, whereas the postlabelling assay was the only one with some specificity for DNA alterations caused by known compounds...|$|R

40|$|The <b>alkaline</b> filter <b>elution</b> assay {{using the}} gills of the {{freshwater}} clam species Corbicula fluminea detect genotoxic effects (breaks in single stranded DNA) at low concentrations of genotoxicants. The test {{can be applied}} for surface water samples without any artificial preparations such as pre-concentration {{because of the high}} filtration rate of the clams. In agreement with the aims of the project the sensitivity of the assay could be increased by a successful optimization with regard to an application in a routine laboratory. By comparison of data between two laboratorys a high grade of test standardization became obvious. With the objective of optimizing the test system, factors influencing the uptake of genooxic substances in relation to the filtration rate of the exposed clams were studied. The most important factors {{turned out to be the}} temperature and the volume of test water, as well as the exposure time. Differences in body size and in the amount of suspended particles in native surface water did not play a significant role. The high sensitivity of the test remained constant during the reproductive cycle when only the outer demibranches (gills) were used as targed tissue. The midgut gland proved to be a suitable targed organ, too. The sensitivity of the test depended on the test substances. For example the sensitivity thresholds for monosubstances were in the one-digit (4 -nitroquinoline- 1 -oxide NQO) or two-digit (methylnitronitrosoguanidine MNNG, dimethylnitrosamine DMN) #mu#g/L range or in the mg/L range (methylmethansufonate MMS). Acetylaminofluorene (AAF) was not detectable up to 1 mg/L. A complex mixture of 10 genotixicants which contained NQO showed at low concentrations similar effects as just the monosubstance NQO. A binary mixture of NQO and MNNG showed no additive effects, too. In native samples of surface water from the Rhine, Wahnbach dam, Elbe, Wupper and Mulde low genotoxic effects were detected in the range of the proof threshold, which were regarded as negative results, finally. Samples from stronger polluted sites (as a result of industrial effluents or mining wastes) yielded clear positive results.

40|$|Ribosome-inactivating {{proteins}} (RIPs) {{remove a}} specific adenine from 28 S rRNA leading to inactivation of ribosomes and arrest of translation. Great interest as {{to a possible}} second physiological substrate for RIPs came from the observation that in vitro RIPs remove adenine from DNA. This paper addresses the problem of nuclear lesions induced by RIPs in human endothelial cells susceptible to the bacterial RIP Shiga toxin 1 and the plant RIP ricin. With both toxins, nuclear DNA damage as evaluated by two independent techniques (alkaline-halo assay and <b>alkaline</b> filter <b>elution)</b> appears early, concomitant with (ricin) or after (Shiga toxin 1) the inhibition of protein synthesis. At this time, the annexin V binding assay, caspase 3 activity, the formation of typical ≤ 50 Kb DNA fragments, and changes in morphology associated with apoptosis were negative. Furthermore, a block of translation comparable to that induced by RIPs, but obtained with cycloheximide, did not induce nuclear damage. Such damage {{is consistent with the}} enzymatic activity (removal of adenine) of RIPs acting in vitro on RNA-free chromatin and DNA. The results unequivocally indicate that RIPs can damage nuclear DNA in whole cells by means that are not secondary to ribosome inactivation or apoptosis...|$|R

Therefore, an increase in DNA incision, not a decrease in ligation, results from the inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in alkylated cells. This is consistent with recent findings by others that suggest that repair-patch frequency is increased in alkylated cells when polyADP-ribosylation is inhibited.;Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites were measured in HeLa cells by digestion of cellular DNA with Escherichia coli endonuclease IV, an AP-specific endonuclease, prior to <b>alkaline</b> <b>elution.</b> The absence of non-specific endonuclease activity allowed endonuclease IV-sensitive AP sites to be detected with the sensitivity of conventional <b>alkaline</b> <b>elution.</b> Cells that were alkylated with dimethylsulfate, but not benzo(a) pyrene diol epoxide, contained AP sites that were repaired along with DNA single-strand breaks during a post-alkylation recovery period. In addition, alkali-labile sites (that become single-strand breaks in the presence of alkali) other than AP sites were resolved in dimethylsulfate-treated cells by comparing the rate of elution of endonuclease IV-digested DNA at pH 12. 1 and pH 12. 6. Alkali-labile sites were also observed in benzo(a) pyrene diol epoxide-treated cells. However, these alkali-labile sites were not sensitive to endonuclease IV, and hence are not AP sites.;According to the base {{excision repair}} model, the sequential action of DNA glycosylases and AP endonucleases is thought to initiate the repair of DNA base damage.

40|$|The {{chemistry}} of the mitomycin C-related drug indoloquinone EO 9 {{would suggest that}} its mechanism of action is likely to involve DNA damage after reductive activation. The ability of this agent to induce DNA damage in intact cells has been examined using <b>alkaline</b> filter <b>elution.</b> After treatment with pharmacologically relevant concentrations of EO 9, both DNA strand breaks and interstrand cross-links were detected in rat Walker tumour cells and human HT 29 colon carcinoma cells. These cell lines express relatively high levels of DT-diaphorase (NAD(P) H: quinone acceptor oxidoreductase), which {{is believed to be}} involved in EO 9 activation. The extent of DNA damage was increased by approximately 30 -fold under hypoxia in BE colon carcinoma cells that express non-functional DT-diaphorase, but this dramatic hypoxia enhancement was not seen in HT- 29 cells. These data are consistent with cytotoxicity studies that indicate that DT-diaphorase appears to be important in EO 9 activation under aerobic conditions, but other enzymes may be more relevant under hypoxia. The involvement of DT-diaphorase in DNA damage induction was further investigated using cell-free assays. DNA cross-links were detectable in plasmid DNA co-incubated with EO 9, cofactor and DT-diaphorase but not in the absence of this enzyme.

The number of DNA cross-links (CLs) induced was determined using <b>alkaline</b> step <b>elution</b> analysis. The induction and removal of total photo-adducts was followed using radioactively labelled compounds. HP showed the same photobinding capacity as 8 -MOP. As a function of UVA dose, it was less effective than 8 -MOP for the induction of CLs and genetic effects. However, {{as a function of}} CLs induced, HP was shown to be more effective for the induction of lethal effects and mitotic recombination than 8 -MOP but equally effective for the induction of mutations. The results suggest that, although CLs are recognized as genetically effective lesions, at a given number of CLs, HP induced mono-adducts efficiently contribute to the induction of lethal effects and mitotic recombination but less to the induction of mutations. Using a re-irradiation protocol, HP was brought to yield the same relative amounts of CLs at the same number of total adducts as single UVA exposures with 8 -MOP. In these conditions, mutation induction and the kinetics for the removal of photo-adducts were the same for both agents indicating that not only the removal of adducts but also mutation induction are highly dependent on the relative level of CLs induced...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} whether DNA damage increased in subjects possibly exposed to high amounts of antineoplastic agents. METHODS: The level of genetic damage was determined in peripheral mononuclear blood cells with the {{sister chromatid exchange}} test, the <b>alkaline</b> <b>elution</b> technique, and the cytokinesis block micronucleus test. RESULTS: The supposed increased exposure of the study subjects {{was caused by a}} malfunction of a safety hood resulting in leakage of air during preparation of an infusion of an antineoplastic drug. Two months after a new safety hood was installed, the frequencies of micronuclei and sister chromatid exchanges of exposed nurses (n = 10) were still significantly increased when compared with a matched control group (p < 0. 01 and p < 0. 05, one sided Wilcoxon test, respectively). In a second examination seven months later, the frequency of micronuclei had significantly decreased to control values (p < 0. 05, one sided Wilcoxon test, n = 6). Moreover, the study subjects who smoked (n = 8) had significantly increased frequencies of micronuclei and sister chromatid exchanges (p < 0. 01 and p < 0. 05, one sided U test, respectively).

DPCs were detected in both the marrow and the exfoliated lung cells. ^ The lack of significant responses in SD rats and A-strain mice below 15 ppm HCHO is explainable by host defense mechanisms. Apparently, the mucociliary apparatus and enzymatic detoxification are sufficient to reduce systemic toxicity to low level concentrations of formaldehyde. ...|$|E
40|$|Bifunctional alkylating {{agents are}} known to produce cross-links between DNA and protein and between paired DNA strands. The {{possibility}} of discriminating these two classes of cross-links in L 1210 cells treated with haloethylnitrosoureas or nitrogen mustard was explored with the <b>alkaline</b> <b>elution</b> technique. Two classes of cross-links were demonstrated, based on sensitivity to proteinase K; the proteinase-sensitive cross-links appear to be DNAprotein cross-links, and the proteinase-resistant class may include interstrand cross-links. Proteinase-sensitive cross-links form more rapidly than do proteinase-resistant cross-links in cells treated with chloroethylnitrosoureas, perhaps because these agents can chloroethylate protein sulfhydryl or amino groups followed by rapid reaction o...|$|E
40|$|Ergotamine {{has been}} used for {{therapeutic}} purposes since the 1950 s, usually to treat vascular headache. It is highly toxic and in large, repeated doses can produce all the symptoms of ergot poisoning. A selective and sensitive method, based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS 2), has been developed for quantifying ergotamine in biological fluids with use of a quick and easy sample preparation. Ergotamine and the internal standard, trideuterated lysergic acid diethylamide, were extracted from human urine, blood, and hair by means of liquid-liquid extraction at <b>alkaline</b> pH. Gradient <b>elution</b> on a cyanopropyl column was used for chromatographic separation. Positive ion electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry determination by collision-induced dissociation were performed in an ion trap mass spectrometer. The method was validated and successfully applied to a case of iatrogenic ergotism resulting from the intake of ergotamine tartrate for treating headache. For the first time, ergotamine was identified and quantified in hair. The ergotamine concentrations measured were 320 pg/mL in blood, 100 pg/mL in urine, 24 pg/mg in proximal hair, and 15 pg/mg in distal hair...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} gamma-radiation-induced DNA strand breaks have been {{investigated}} using two systems: a plasmid-based assay, and a whole nuclei-, or whole cell-based, <b>alkaline</b> filter <b>elution</b> assay. Addition of alkali metal halides to DNA irradiated under frozen aqueous conditions were observed {{to have an effect}} on the radiosensitivity of the DNA. This, effect, which was not observed with DNA irradiated under fluid aqueous conditions, would appear to be due to two components; a physical component, and a chemical component which is dependent on the anions used. Addition of alkali metal halides appears to increase the volume of the hydrating layer of water which is formed around the DNA when it is frozen. This appears to increase the target volume when it is irradiated, with an observed increase in damage caused by H 2 O-+ and non-hydrated electrons from the ionisation of the hydration water. The chemical component, which may be a protective or a sensitising effect, is dependent on the anion in the system. The scavenging of electrons produced from the direct action of gamma radiation on DNA has been demonstrated using the intercalator, mitozantrone. This was demonstrated using plasmid DNA irradiated under frozen aqueous solutions, and compared with the e. s. r. spectroscopy results obtained by my coworkers. Finally, the protection of DNA by free-thiols has been investigated. Under indirect, dilute aqueous conditions, the amount of protection to plasmid DNA was observed to increase with increasing positive charge on the thiols. Under direct, frozen aqueous conditions, the radiosensitivity of plasmid DNA by the compounds used was less clear cut. Possible reasons for this contrast are discussed. The effect of a novel aminothiol with a + 3 positive charge on the amount of damage to tissue culture cells was also investigated...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} studies in mice were {{performed}} to determine the interaction of two sulfur nucleophiles, oral n-acetylcysteine (NAC) and intravenous sodium thiosulfate (Na₂S₂O₃) with the anticancer drug mitomycin C (MMC). Neither nucleophile reduced MMC lethality or hematopoietic toxicity. Both increased the antitumor activity of MMC in mice bearing P- 388 and L- 1210 leukemias. There was no nucleophile reduction of MMC effects on normal bone marrow stem cells (CFUs) using a murine spleen colony forming assay. In contrast, the nucleophiles significantly enhanced MMC bone marrow toxicity. Three clonogenic human tumor cell lines (HEC- 1 A endometrial, 8226 myeloma, WiDr colon) were relatively resistant to MMC and the nucleophiles did not increase activity. A human breast cancer cell line (MCF- 7) was sensitive to MMC and this activity was blocked by glutathione. Oxygen free radical scavengers did not reduce MMC activity. A novel isocratic high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay (48 : 52, methanol: 0. 01 M phosphate buffer) using ultraviolet detection at 365 nm was used to characterize MMC-protein binding and murine pharmacokinetics. The k' for MMC was 7. 91 and 9. 86 for porfiromycin. Peaks were confirmed by mass spectroscopy. MMC was bound 30 % to albumin and S- 9 microsomal proteins and 60 - 70 % to calf thymus DNA. MMC uptake into mouse bone marrow was enhanced by the nucleophiles and was rapidly cleared from the plasma (half-life 0. 5 hours). In vitro MMC metabolism with rat liver S- 9 microsomes demonstrated production of a polar eluting, putative MMC metabolite (K' = 4. 486, lambda maximum 300 nm). This metabolite was inactive in the in vitro clonogenic tumor cell assay. Finally, molecular pharmacology studies using <b>alkaline</b> DNA <b>elution</b> showed that MMC causes both DNA-DNA and DNA-protein crosslinks. There was no evidence for free radical-induced DNA strand scission by MMC. There was also some evidence of moderate DNA protection with the sulfur nucleophiles...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{exposure}} of cells for 60 min to a serum free medium at ice temperature {{followed by a}} return to normal culture conditions (30 min at 37 °C) caused a dramatic decrease in NAD+ levels.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of genotoxic substances in river {{water is a}} serious problem because of their risk for both human and ecosystem health. Although numerous test methods for the genotoxicological testing of water samples are described in the literature from Germany and abroad, no sound experience has been gained as to whether the test systems hitherto used are sufficiently sensitive and suited for routine use. Therefore, a research project was designed to develop a test strategy for the detection and evaluation of genotoxic effects in surface water aquatic organisms. Indicator tests were evaluated with respect to their predictive power, sensitivity an practicability in order to determine whether they are suitable for inclusion in a battery of tests. The bioassays utilized in this study include the umu-test, <b>alkaline</b> filter <b>elution</b> (mussels, green algae), the DNA unwinding test (fish larvae, cray fish, mussels, fish cell lines), the comet assay (protozoans, green algae, mussels, primary fish hepatocytes, fish and mammalian cell lines) and the UDS-test (primary fish hepatocytes). The Ames Salmonella assay, a direct genotoxicity assay and a well-known base test in chemicals assessment, was included in the study programme for comparison. (orig.) assays. The test- and substance-specific sensitivity thresholds were determined. In a simplified interlaboratory trial 4 non-spiked and genotoxin-spiked surface water samples from the river Weisse Elster (doted genotoxin: a Gentox mixture based on 4 -NQO) were tested with the assays with the result that reproducible dose-effect relationships have been shown. In a second phase of the project the validated methods were applied to nonconcentrated samples of surface water taken on a monthly basis from the river Rhine, the Wahnbach dam, the rivers Elbe and Mulde over a period of 12 months {{as well as from the}} river Wupper and a gasworks site. This allowed temporal and spatial variations to be identified over a relatively long period of time. Chemical profile analyses were carried out on all samples to identify genotoxic contaminants, but the chemical data generated did not reflect the genotoxic effects found by the biological methods. The data obtained showed the comet assay, the umu-test and the Ames-test to be particularly sensitive and to detect genotoxic effects in complex mixtures in a low dose range. They seem to be suitable for routine testing and should therefore be used in the first stage of a graduated testing battery for detectionof gentoxicity in surfaceSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 00 B 946 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Bildung und Forschung (BMBF), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{involvement of}} ceramide-related signaling {{processes in the}} induction of apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor alpha was assessed by multiple biochemical strategies in the human leukemic cell lines HL- 60 and U 937 and the murine fibrosarcoma cell lines L 929 /LM and WEHI 164 / 13. Exposure of these cells to tumor necrosis factor alpha resulted in internucleosomal cleavage of genomic DNA, yielding laddered patterns of oligonucleosomal fragments characteristic of apoptosis when resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis; similar responses were observed after exposure to exogenous sphingomyelinase or synthetic ceramides. Quantitative spectrofluorophotometry demonstrated that these treatments promoted time- and concentration-dependent degradation of DNA, resulting {{in the formation of}} and eventual release of small DNA fragments (< or = 3. 0 kb). Corresponding damage to bulk DNA was demonstrated by enhanced-fluorescence alkaline unwinding analysis. DNA fragmentation was not induced by phospholipase C or synthetic diglyceride; in fact, the effects of sphingomyelinase and ceramide were substantially reduced by coexposure to these agents, suggesting opposing roles for diglyceride- and ceramide-mediated signals in the regulation of apoptosis. Phospholipase A 2 and arachidonic acid failed to promote DNA fragmentation, as did phospholipase D. Characterization of DNA strand breaks by <b>alkaline</b> and neutral <b>elution</b> analyses confirmed that ceramide action was restricted to breakage of mature, double-stranded DNA but not of nascent DNA. The induction of DNA damage was associated with appearance of apoptotic morphology and decreased clonogenicity. These results demonstrate that the ceramide-dependent signaling system selectively induces apoptosis and raise the possibility that ceramide-activated enzymes represent important components in a signaling cascade involved in the regulation of programmed cell death...|$|R

The AZ 364 cell line was 15 times more resistant to ADR (ID 50 = 10. 0 μg/ml) than the AZ 224 cell line (ID 50 = 0. 66 μg/ml) after 1 hr of drug exposure. Immediately after exposure, we observed a biphasic dose response for SSB in the AZ 224 cells over a concentration range of 0. 1 to 32. 0 μg/ml, while practically no DSB were found. Upon drug removal and incubation in drug-free medium, full repair of SSB was observed for an ADR concentration of 1 μg/ml. On the contrary, the DSB became significantly increased for all tested concentrations and persisted as observed after 3 hr and 7 hr in drug-free medium. The resistant cell line AZ 364 showed consistently less DNA breakage than the AZ 224 cell line. This inherent difference in sensitivity to ADR could, however, not be explained {{on the basis of the}} cellular pharmacokinetics of the drug. Verapamil induced a 3 to 4 fold potentiation of the ADR cytotoxicity in both cell lines after continuous exposure and was associated with an increase in DNA-breakage. The results of our study confirm that there is a lack of correlation between cytotoxicity of ADR and DNA strand breakage immediately after 1 hr of drug exposure. Instead, we emphasize the importance of the formation, extent and persistence of protein-associated DSB upon drug removal to the cytotoxic action of ADR in vitro.
