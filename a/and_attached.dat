5|$|From 20 October 1918, Statton {{was granted}} ten days leave to Paris. Returning to the 40th Battalion, {{he was sent}} to Amiens the {{following}} day <b>and</b> <b>attached</b> to 4th Army Guard for special duties over a three-day period. Briefly re-joining his battalion, Statton was shipped to England on 5 November for special duties. During this time, the Armistice was signed officially declaring the war's end, and Statton was granted two weeks leave in December.|$|E

Kelly that New York's law prohibiting out-of-state wineries from {{shipping}} directly to consumers in New York was constitutional even though in-state wineries were allowed to. The case, which invoked the 21st Amendment, was appealed <b>and</b> <b>attached</b> to another case. The case reached the Supreme Court later on as Swedenburg v. Kelly and was overruled in a 5–4 decision that found the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|Owing to its unusual advowson, Chesham {{historically}} had two vicarages. The Upper Parsonage, {{also known}} as Bury Hill House, {{was built in the}} 16th century <b>and</b> <b>attached</b> to Chesham Leicester, and was used as a residence by the Skottowe family following their acquisition of Chesham Leicester; it was a large mansion house immediately north of St.Mary's Church. In the early 19th century the house was bought and demolished by the Lowndes family.|$|E

5|$|Still {{struggling}} with writer's block, Irving traveled to Germany, settling in Dresden {{in the winter}} of 1822. Here he dazzled the royal family <b>and</b> <b>attached</b> himself to Mrs. Amelia Foster, an American living in Dresden with her five children. Irving was particularly attracted to Mrs. Foster's 18-year-old daughter Emily and vied in frustration for her hand. Emily finally refused his offer of marriage in the spring of 1823.|$|E
5|$|The {{hymenium}} {{is developed}} on the under (outer) {{side of the}} fruit body. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) consist of a globular part (the hypobasidia) to which inflated or elongated epibasidia are attached. In Guepinia, the hypobasidia are egg-shaped to , measuring 12–16 by 9–12 μm, <b>and</b> <b>attached</b> to fibril-like epibasidia that are 20–45 by 3–4μm. The spore deposit is white, while the spores are 9–11 by 5–6μm, hyaline (translucent), cylindrical to elongated ellipsoid in shape, and have a large oil drop.|$|E

5|$|A {{downline}} {{used for}} open ocean diving {{is much the}} same as a shotline, but does not reach {{all the way to the}} bottom. An open-ocean downline is weighted at the bottom, <b>and</b> <b>attached</b> to a substantial float at the surface, which may be tethered to the boat. It may be marked at intervals by knots or loops, and may be attached to decompression trapeze system. In some cases a sea anchor may be used to limit wind drift, particularly if attached to a boat with significant windage.|$|E

5|$|Adults of Diphyllobothrium infest fish, and the juveniles use copepod {{crustaceans}} as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids {{release their}} eggs into the water, and the eggs hatch into ciliated, swimming larvae. If a larva is swallowed by a copepod, it sheds the cilia {{and the skin}} becomes a syncitium and the larva makes {{its way into the}} copepod's hemocoel (internal cavity that is {{the main part of the}} circulatory system) <b>and</b> <b>attached</b> itself with three small hooks. If the copepod is eaten by a fish, the larva metamorphoses into a small, unsegmented tapeworm, drills through to the gut and becomes an adult.|$|E
5|$|Because the big {{gap between}} the ROK Capital and ROK 8th Divisions made it {{impossible}} for ROK I Corps at Kyongju to direct the action of the 8th Division, the ROK Army transferred that division to the control of the ROK II Corps on September 7, <b>and</b> <b>attached</b> to it the ROK 5th Regiment of the ROK 7th Division. This shift of command came just as the NK 15th Division penetrated the ROK 8th Division lines to enter Yongch'on in the Taegu-P'ohang-dong corridor. From west of An'gang-ni the ROK 3rd Regiment drove toward Yongch'on, attempting to close the gap.|$|E
5|$|By 1805, {{during the}} War of the Third Coalition, the Polish troops in Italy had been renamed the 1st Polish Legion (1e Legion Polonaise) <b>and</b> <b>attached</b> to the Kingdom of Italy. In 1806, {{all that was}} left of the old Dąbrowski and Kniaziewicz's Legions was one demi-brigade, {{consisting}} of one infantry regiment and one cavalry regiment, now {{in the service of the}} Kingdom of Naples. It fought at Castel Franco, turning the Austrian attack on 24 November 1805, but on 3 July 1806 it suffered a severe defeat at Sant'Eufemia a Maiella. Many Polish officers served in French army or allied formations.|$|E

5|$|Captain Pulteney Malcolm on Donegal {{attacked}} Brave directly, firing his starboard {{guns and}} then crossing Braves stern, inflicting severe damage with a raking broadside, before pulling alongside again and engaging from close range. Badly damaged, Brave surrendered. Malcolm then ordered Captain Richard Dunn in Acasta to take possession as Donegal moved forward to engage Jupiter. With Donegal alongside Jupiter, Captain Samuel Pym in Atlas abandoned his brief {{engagement with the}} French ship and steered for the melee surrounding the increasingly isolated Impérial. Taking advantage of his ship's superior speed, Malcolm pulled ahead of Jupiter and then rammed her bow, securing the ships together to prevent the French vessel from escaping. Recognising that further resistance was hopeless, Captain Gaspard Laignel surrendered immediately. Malcolm then sent 100 men on board as a prize crew <b>and</b> <b>attached</b> a towline to the French ship, just as the trailing Agamemnon finally reached the battle.|$|E
5|$|Father Francis Gleeson (28 May 1884 – 26 June 1959) was an Irish Roman Catholic {{priest who}} served as a British Army {{chaplain}} during Ireland's involvement in the First World War. Educated at seminaries near Dublin, Gleeson was ordained in 1910 and worked at a home for the blind before volunteering for service upon the outbreak of war. Commissioned into the Army Chaplains' Department <b>and</b> <b>attached</b> to the 2nd Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers he served with them at the First Battle of Ypres. During this battle Gleeson is said to have taken command of the battalion after all the officers were incapacitated by the enemy. He was highly regarded by his men for tending to the wounded under fire, visiting the frontline trenches, and bringing gifts.|$|E
5|$|Floyd's Confederate {{force of}} {{approximately}} 17,000 men {{consisted of three}} divisions (Army of Central Kentucky), garrison troops, <b>and</b> <b>attached</b> cavalry. The three divisions were commanded by Floyd (replaced by Colonel Gabriel C. Wharton when Floyd took command of the entire force) and Brig. Gens. Bushrod Johnson and Simon Bolivar Buckner. During the battle, Johnson, the engineering officer who briefly commanded Fort Donelson in late January, was effectively superseded by Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow (Grant's opponent at his first battle at Belmont). Pillow, who arrived at Fort Donelson on February 9, was displaced from overall command of the fort when the more-senior Floyd arrived. The garrison troops were commanded by Col. John W. Head and the cavalry by Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest.|$|E

The fin was clearly weight bearing, being attached to a massive shoulder with expanded scapular and coracoid elements <b>and</b> <b>attached</b> to the body armor, large muscular scars on the ventral surface of the humerus, and highly mobile distal joints. The bones of the forefins show large muscle facets, suggesting that the fin was both muscular and {{had the ability to}} flex like a wrist joint. These wrist-like features would have helped anchor the creature to the bottom in fast moving current.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Reich {{bought an}} {{oscillograph}} <b>and</b> <b>attached</b> it {{to friends and}} students, who volunteered to touch and kiss each other while Reich read the tracings. One of the volunteers was a young Willy Brandt, the future chancellor of Germany. At the time, {{he was married to}} Reich's secretary, Gertrude Gaasland, and was living in Norway to organize protests against the Nazis. Reich also took measurements from the patients of a psychiatric hospital near Oslo, including catatonic patients, with the permission of the hospital's director. Reich described the oscillograph experiments in 1937 in Experimentelle Ergebniße Über Die Elektrische Funktion von Sexualität und Angst (The Bioelectrical Investigation of Sexuality and Anxiety).|$|E
5|$|Kepler {{began by}} {{exploring}} regular polygons and regular solids, including the figures {{that would come}} to be known as Kepler's solids. From there, he extended his harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies—and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between orbital velocity and orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler—with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories—treated them much more precisely <b>and</b> <b>attached</b> new physical significance to them.|$|E
