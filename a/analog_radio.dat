5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Nødnett, Norway had three separate systems for telecommunications within the police, fire departments and paramedics, all based on <b>analog</b> <b>radio.</b> The old system had two main downsides: it was not encrypted, and it prevented communication between agencies. This was particularly problematic in larger disasters and accidents, and in instances where criminals listened to the police radio during police actions. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate had also instructed the agencies to encrypt their communications for reasons of privacy. This would either have to be done through an expensive upgrade to the existing systems, or through the construction of a new, digital network.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Public Safety Radio {{has been}} {{installed}} in Oslo, Østfold, Akershus and southern Buskerud. The system is uses Terrestrial Trunked Radio {{and allows for}} a common public safety network for all emergency agencies. Features include authentication, encryption and possibilities to transmit data traffic. As the system is rolled out, central parts will receive transmission speeds of 163 kbit/s. The {{rest of the country}} uses an <b>analog</b> <b>radio</b> system specific for each police district. In addition to lack of interoperability with paramedics and fire fighters, none of the systems are encrypted, forcing police officers to rely heavily on GSM-based mobile telephones for dispatch communication when transmitting sensitive information.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1950s {{the units}} were {{equipped}} with radios in the 4m frequency band, handheld units {{work in the}} 2m band. This <b>analog</b> <b>radio</b> usage is protected by law for emergency use only. Relay stations cover whole Germany. With entering the appropriate channel, every radio can reach another dispatch center or agency.|$|E

50|$|The NAC is {{a feature}} similar to CTCSS or DCS for <b>analog</b> <b>radios.</b> That is, radios can be {{programmed}} to only pass audio when receiving the correct NAC. NACs are programmed as a three-hexadecimal-digit code that is transmitted along with the digital signal being transmitted.|$|R
25|$|Since around 2010 a {{nationwide}} digital radio communication standard is implemented. This {{is based on}} the Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) standards. Main advances over the old <b>analog</b> <b>radio</b> system are availability of far more channels and communication groups, encryption possibilities, noise filtering and enhanced signal reliability. To cover whole Germany about 4500 base stations are needed. As of August 2015 already 4338 of them are installed and 4323 working, thus about 97% of Germany is covered. Migration to the new radio standard is ongoing step by step, parallel use of the analog system is planned until around 2020.|$|E
500|$|However, {{despite the}} pending switch to digital, analog {{television}} remains being transmitted in most countries. An {{exception is the}} United States that ended analog television transmission (by all but the very low-power TV stations) on 12 June 2009 after twice delaying the switchover deadline,Kenya also ended analog television transmission in December 2014 after multiple delays. For analog television, there are three standards in use for broadcasting color TV (see a map on adoption [...] ). These are known as PAL (German designed), NTSC (North American designed), and SECAM (French designed). (It {{is important to understand}} that these are the ways of sending color TV, and they do not {{have anything to do with}} the standards for black & white TV, which also vary from country to country.) For <b>analog</b> <b>radio,</b> the switch to digital radio is made more difficult by the fact that analog receivers are sold at a small fraction of the price of digital receivers. The choice of modulation for <b>analog</b> <b>radio</b> is typically between amplitude (AM) or frequency modulation (FM). To achieve stereo playback, an amplitude modulated subcarrier is used for stereo FM.|$|E

5000|$|A {{substantial}} {{problem of}} analog AM transmission {{is that it}} is subject to poor signal to noise ratio due to radio frequency noise from man made and natural sources, such as fluorescent lamps, motors, switches and lightning. Simply adding high frequency information does not produce high fidelity. HD Radio signals on AM, however, use more bandwidth signal wise and often create [...] "hash" [...] on surrounding frequencies, up to 30 kHz from the center frequency. This interference, which is audible mainly on <b>analog</b> <b>radios,</b> {{was one of the reasons}} Citadel Communications pulled night broadcasts of their AM HD station's signals.
