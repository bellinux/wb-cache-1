5|$|World War II in Europe {{began on}} Friday 1 September 1939, when German forces invaded Poland. Lützow did not {{participate}} in this campaign. He was tasked with providing fighter protection for Berlin. From the Jagdfliegerschule in Werneuchen, he detached two squadrons <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>them</b> under the command of Jagdgruppe 20 based at Strausberg. At the end of October 1939, a change in command of I. Gruppe (1st group) of Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG3—3rd Fighter Wing) was announced. The former commander Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel) Otto-Heinrich von Houwald was transferred to the Jagdfliegerschule in Werneuchen. Lützow joined I. Gruppe on 1 November 1939, officially taking over command as Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) two days later.|$|E
5|$|Dokeianos re-appears in 1050, when he {{held the}} titles of patrikios and vestarches, {{as part of an}} {{imperial}} expedition against the Pechenegs who raided Thrace. The imperial commander-in-chief, the eunuch praipositos Constantine, a militarily inexperienced court favourite of Emperor Constantine IX (r. 1042–55), listened to his advice on fortifying the army's encampment, but when the Pechenegs appeared before Adrianople, he refused to heed the opinion of the magistros Constantine Arianites to wait and attack the Pechenegs on their return journey, and instead marched to meet them in the open field of Basilike Libas, resulting in a devastating defeat: Arianites fell, while Dokeianos was taken prisoner. As he was brought before the Pecheneg leader, however, Dokeianos seized a sword from one of his guards and slashed at the leader, cutting off one of his arms, whereupon the enraged Pechenegs killed him and, according to Michael Attaleiates, opened his belly, cut off his arms and legs <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>them</b> in it.|$|E
5|$|Tapping felt {{acting on}} the new show went a little easier when filming Carter scenes with Bill Dow ("Bill Lee"), {{with whom she had}} {{previously}} worked on Stargate SG-1. She said another factor that made acting on Atlantis easier was the welcoming cast and crew of the series. Tapping's hair was longer than it was during her time on SG-1, and the military approved of the change {{as long as it was}} worn up. To save money on visual effects, the crew built set pieces to represent some of the buildings on M7R-227 <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>them</b> in front of the puddle jumper set. Another measure taken as a substitute to visual effects was to cast mime artists as the frozen Asurans.|$|E

5|$|The news of Selena's death deeply {{affected}} the Latino community; many people traveled {{thousands of miles}} to visit Selena's house, boutiques, and the crime scene. By mid-afternoon, police were asked to form a detour as a line of automobiles began backing up traffic from the Quintanillas' house. On the street where Selena had lived, gang graffiti and cacti distinguished the blue-collar community from other subdivisions across America. A chain-link fence in front of Selena's house became a shrine festooned with mementos as fans from across America left messages to Selena and the Quintanilla family. Most car drivers in Corpus Christi, and those driving cars on Interstate 37 from Mexico, turned their headlights on in her memory. Fans scribbled notes and messages, <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>them</b> {{on the door and}} doorstep of the room in which Selena had been shot.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few years}} of the end of World War II, the United States {{deactivated}} all of its remaining battleships <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>them</b> in the United States Navy reserve fleets. Most of these ships were eventually scrapped, but the four Iowa-class battleships were not, and on several occasions {{one or more of these}} four battleships were reactivated for naval gunfire support. The U.S. Navy has held onto the four Iowa-class battleships long after the upkeep and maintenance of operating and maintaining a battleship and the arrival of aircraft and precision guided munitions led other nations to scrap their big-gun fleets. Congress was largely responsible for keeping the four Iowa-class battleships in the United States Navy reserve fleets and on the Naval Vessel Register as long as they did. The lawmakers argued that the battleships' large-caliber guns had a useful destructive power that is lacking in the smaller, cheaper, and faster guns mounted by U.S. cruisers and destroyers.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to these Byzantine successes, Caliph al-Mahdi now resolved to take the field in person. On 12 March 780, Mahdi departed Baghdad and via Aleppo marched to Hadath, which he refortified. He then advanced to Arabissus, where he left the army and returned to Baghdad. His son and heir Harun—better known by his laqab, or regnal name, al-Rashid—was left in charge of {{one half of the}} army, which raided the Armeniac Theme and took the small fort of Semaluos. Thumama, who had been entrusted with the other half, penetrated deeper into Asia Minor. He marched west as far as the Thracesian Theme, but was heavily defeated there by Lachanodrakon. In June 781, as the Arab invasion force assembled at Hadath under Abd al-Kabir, a great-great-nephew of the Caliph Umar (r. 634–644), and again prepared to launch their annual raid, Empress Irene called up the thematic armies of Asia Minor <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>them</b> under the eunuch sakellarios John. The Muslims crossed into Byzantine Cappadocia over the Pass of Hadath, and were met near Caesarea by the combined Byzantine forces under Lachanodrakon. The ensuing battle resulted in a costly Arab defeat, forcing Abd al-Kabir to abandon his campaign and retreat to Syria.|$|E

He also {{was both a}} Hugh Durham Award and Jim Phelan Award finalist all three years of his career. Stevens {{has been called a}} {{coaching}} prodigy and compared to John Wooden. He is married with two young children. In July 2013, he signed a six-year, 22-million-dollar contract to become the head coach of the Boston Celtics in the NBA. In April 2015, Stevens led the Celtics to the NBA Playoffs as the 7th seed in the Eastern Conference with a 40–42 record. In April 2016, Brad Stevens led the Celtics to their second consecutive playoff appearance under his tenure as the 5th seed in the 2016 NBA Playoffs finishing the season with a 48–34 record. On June 1, 2016, Stevens received a contract extension. In the 2016–17 season, Stevens' team finished with a laudable 53–29 record. It earned them the Atlantic Division title <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>them</b> as the best overall team in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics then entered post-season play as the number one seed in their conference. Both the division title as well as the number one seeding are bests thus far for the Stevens' led Celtics' teams.|$|E
5|$|The British {{response}} to Hamelin's deployment {{was provided by}} Admiral Albemarle Bertie, who collected a squadron of ships from those available at the Cape of Good Hope <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>them</b> {{under the command of}} Commodore Josias Rowley. Bertie gave Rowley instructions to blockade the islands and prepare for invasion attempts once the required forces could be spared. During 1809 and the spring of 1810, Rowley maintained the blockade and launched a series of small raids, the largest being at Saint Paul on Île Bonaparte in September 1809. By July 1810, Rowley had developed sufficient forces at his island base on Rodriguez to successfully invade and capture Île Bonaparte, which he restored to its former name of Île Bourbon. In August, Rowley attempted to extend his blockade of Isle de France by seizing small islands off the main ports that could control the passage of shipping through the coral reefs that surround the island. The first operation was to capture Île de la Passe off Grand Port, which was successfully secured on 13 August. Shortly afterwards a French squadron forced passage into the harbour and Captain Samuel Pym ordered the four frigates of the blockade squadron to attack the ships anchored in the bay. The ensuing Battle of Grand Port was a disaster for the British, as two frigates were wrecked on the reefs and two others captured with their entire crews: only the very seriously wounded, including Captain Nesbit Willoughby, were repatriated to Île Bourbon.|$|E
