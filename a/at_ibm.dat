5|$|Samarium-doped calcium {{fluoride}} crystals {{were used as}} an active medium {{in one of the}} first solid-state lasers designed and constructed by Peter Sorokin (co-inventor of the dye laser) and Mirek Stevenson <b>at</b> <b>IBM</b> research labs in early 1961. This samarium laser emitted pulses of red light at 708.5nm. It had to be cooled by liquid helium and thus did not find practical applications.|$|E
5|$|In the 1962–63 NBA season, Eddie Gottlieb {{sold the}} Warriors {{franchise}} for $850,000 (equal to about $ today) {{to a group}} of businessmen led by Marty Simmons from San Francisco, and the team relocated to become the San Francisco Warriors under a new coach, Bob Feerick. This also meant, however, that the team broke apart, as Paul Arizin chose to retire rather than move away from his family and his job <b>at</b> <b>IBM</b> in Philadelphia, and Tom Gola was homesick, requesting a trade to the lowly New York Knicks halfway through the season. With both secondary scorers gone, Chamberlain continued his array of statistical feats, averaging 44.8 points and 24.3 rebounds per game that year. Despite his individual success, the Warriors lost 49 of their 80 games and missed the playoffs.|$|E

25|$|Copper indium gallium {{selenide}} (CIGS) is {{a direct}} band gap material. It has the highest efficiency (~20%) among all commercially significant thin film materials (see CIGS solar cell). Traditional methods of fabrication involve vacuum processes including co-evaporation and sputtering.

25|$|The Universal Product Code (UPC) is a barcode {{symbology}} that scans 12-digits numbers {{along the}} bar in order to track trade items and to encode information such as pricing to a product on a store's shelf.

25|$|Joseph Orlickly {{and others}} <b>at</b> <b>IBM</b> {{developed}} a push approach to inventory control and production planning, {{now known as}} material requirements planning (MRP), which takes as input both the master production schedule (MPS) {{and the bill of}} materials (BOM) and gives as output a schedule for the materials (components) needed in the production process. MRP therefore is a planning tool to manage purchase orders and production orders (also called jobs).|$|E
25|$|In April 1986, Georg Bednorz and Karl Müller, working <b>at</b> <b>IBM</b> in Zurich, {{discovered}} that certain semiconducting oxides became superconducting at relatively high temperature, in particular, a lanthanum barium copper oxide which becomes superconducting at 35K. This oxide was an oxygen deficient perovskite-related material that proved promising, and stimulated {{the search for}} related compounds with higher superconducting transition temperatures. In 1987, Bednorz and Müller were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.|$|E
