5|$|Stanton's {{position}} {{caused a}} significant rift {{between herself and}} many civil rights leaders, particularly Frederick Douglass, who believed that white women, already empowered by their connection to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. According to Douglass, their treatment as slaves entitled the now liberated <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>men,</b> who lacked women's indirect empowerment, to voting rights before women were granted the franchise. African American women, he believed, {{would have the same}} degree of empowerment as white women once <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>men</b> had the vote; hence, general female suffrage was, according to Douglass, of less concern than black male suffrage.|$|E
5|$|After the American Civil War, both Stanton and Anthony {{broke with}} their {{abolitionist}} backgrounds and lobbied strongly against {{ratification of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, which granted <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>men</b> the right to vote. Believing that <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>men,</b> {{by virtue of the}} Thirteenth Amendment, already had the legal protections, except for suffrage, offered to white male citizens and that so largely expanding the male franchise in the country would only increase the number of voters prepared to deny women the right to vote, both Stanton and Anthony were angry that the abolitionists, their former partners in working for both African American and women's rights, refused to demand that the language of the amendments be changed to include women.|$|E
5|$|After the American Civil War, Stanton's {{commitment}} to female suffrage caused a schism in the women's rights movement when she, together with Susan B. Anthony, declined to support {{passage of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. She opposed giving added legal protection and voting rights to <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>men</b> while women, black and white, were denied those same rights. Her position on this issue, together with her thoughts on organized Christianity and women's issues beyond voting rights, {{led to the formation}} of two separate women's rights organizations that were finally rejoined, with Stanton as president of the joint organization, about twenty years after her break from the original women's suffrage movement.|$|E

5|$|Her {{more radical}} {{positions}} included acceptance of interracial marriage. Despite her opposition to giving <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>men</b> {{the right to}} vote without enfranchising all women and the derogatory language she had resorted to in expressing this opposition, Stanton had no objection to interracial marriage and wrote a congratulatory letter to Frederick Douglass upon his marriage to Helen Pitts, a white woman, in 1884. Anthony, fearing public condemnation of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and wanting to keep the demand for female suffrage foremost, pleaded with Stanton not to make her letter to Douglass or support for his marriage publicly known.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{calls in}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and informs her that four <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>men</b> have been kidnapped in Philadelphia. One {{of them has}} been found dead exhibiting depigmentation. A {{specialist}} from the CDC believes that the men have died from a disease, and has requested Scully to investigate the case. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) joins Scully and {{has some of the}} evidence samples from Sanders' autopsy analyzed by Agent Pendrell, who finds a seed from a rare West African passionflower. Mulder takes the seed to his UN informant Marita Covarrubias and asks for her help; she provides him with information on the incident on the plane.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-five African Americans {{earned the}} Medal of Honor during the American Civil War, {{including}} seven sailors of the Union Navy, fifteen {{soldiers of the}} United States Colored Troops, and three soldiers of other Army units. Fourteen <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>men</b> earned the Medal for actions in the Battle of Chaffin's Farm, where a division of U.S. Colored Troops saw heavy action. Another four men, all sailors, earned their Medals at the Battle of Mobile Bay. William Harvey Carney was the first African American to perform an action for which a Medal of Honor was awarded, but Robert Blake {{was the first to}} actually receive the Medal (Blake's was issued in 1864, Carney did not receive his until 1900). It was common for Civil War Medals of Honor to be awarded decades after the conflict ended; in one case, Andrew Jackson Smith's Medal was not awarded until 2001, 137 years after the action in which he earned it. Smith's wait, caused by a missing battle report, is the longest delay of the award for any recipient, African American or otherwise.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{rates of}} interracial {{cohabitation}} are {{significantly higher than}} those of marriage. Although only 7% of married <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>men</b> have European American wives, 12.5% of cohabitating <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>men</b> have European American partners. 25% of married Asian American women have European spouses, but 45% of cohabitating Asian American women are with European American men—higher than the percentage cohabiting with Asian men (less than 43%). Of cohabiting Asian men, slightly over 37% of Asian men have white female partners and over 10% married to white women. These numbers suggest that the prevalence of intimate interracial contact is around double that of what is represented by marriage data.|$|E

25|$|The AERA {{essentially}} {{collapsed in}} 1869, {{partly because of}} disagreement over the proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which would enfranchise <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>men.</b> Leaders of the women's movement were dismayed {{that it would not}} also enfranchise women. Stanton and Anthony opposed its ratification unless it was accompanied by another amendment that would enfranchise women.|$|E

Several studies have estimated the prevalence of Barrett's esophagus {{in the general population}} to be 1.3% to 1.6% in two European populations (Italian and Swedish), and 3.6% in a Korean population.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, {{some states}} were more {{favorable}} to women's legal status than others; New York, for example, had been giving women full property, parental, and widow's rights since 1860, {{but not the}} right to vote. No state or territory allowed women's suffrage when the Equal Protection Clause took effect in 1868. In contrast, <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>men</b> had full voting rights in five states, at that time.|$|E

25|$|Reviews {{note the}} theme of violence. The novel {{examines}} some of the social causes for the violence depicted.

The New York Times compared the depiction of violence growing from smaller actions to the work of Richard Price. Pelecanos has described the book as an anti-detective novel because no case is solved by the private investigators and they are constantly a step behind the police.|$|E
