40|$|Multimodal supramolecular {{compounds}} that combine imaging and therapeutic capabilities {{are the focus}} of intensive research for applications in the growing field of nanomedicine. These compounds offer the prospect to increase diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic effectiveness, while minimizing side effects from treatment. Nanoparticles with a micellar or liposomal structure obtained by assembling amphiphilic compounds are promising candidates for such multifunctional therapeutic platforms. Selective target of these nanoparticles for cancer cells can be obtained by labeling supramolecular aggregates with peptides able to recognize transmembrane receptors overexpressed in many human tumors. Examples of peptide {{that can be used to}} drive selectively the nanoparticle on the cancer cells are the octreotide (analog of the somatostatin), [7 - 14] bombesin and CCK 8 peptides. To reach this result, new amphiphilic monomers were designed, synthesized and structurally characterized. Amphiphilic monomers are functionalized with polydentate chelating agent (such as DOTA, DTPA and DTPAGlu) able to coordinate radioactive or paramagnetic metals for diagnostic applications, or with bioactive molecules able to recognize the cellular target. These molecules are able to <b>auto</b> <b>assemble</b> or to aggregate in mixed micelles or liposomes in aqueous solution. All monomers were synthesized in solid-phase following an Fmoc strategy. The aggregates formulated are investigated by physical chemical methods like Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), relaxivity measurement and spectroscopy techniques (fluorescence and UV-Vis). These studies have allowed selecting the best systems for shape and size with relation to relaxivity parameters and aggregation stability. To validate the specificity and the citotoxicity of the delivery systems in vitro and in vivo studies were also performed. The monomers containing the chelating agent, (C 18) 2 DOTA, (C 18) 2 DTPA and (C 18) 2 DTPAGlu are able to <b>auto</b> <b>assemble.</b> Moreover in mixed aggregates they showed to drive the aggregation process. Aggregates fuctionalized with octreotide were investigated as promising target-selective contrast agent for MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). The high relaxivity values, associated with the supramolecular aggregates, confirm the obtainment of a more rigid contrast agent able to carry numerous gadolinium ions on target cells. In vitro binding assays on bombesin labeled liposomes allowed to select (C 18) 2 DOTA/(C 18) 2 -L 5 -bombesin as the lead compound. In these supramolecular aggregate, the peptidic monomer contains the more appropriate spacer of the length between the peptide and the hydrophobic moiety. In vivo studies confirmed the specificity towards to the receptor of the bombesin labeled liposome with respect to the liposome exposing a scrambled peptide sequence. Aggregates fuctionalized with CCK 8 peptide were investigated as target-selective drug delivery systems. The drug delivery of chemioterapeutics (i. e. doxorubicin) was studied on A 431 cells overexpressing CCK receptors. The loading and release of the drug were carried out in (C 18) 2 DOTA/(C 18) 2 -L 5 -CCK 8 liposome. The results obtained show the specificity and the efficacy of the system on cellular target, compared with control aggregate. In conclusion this research has permitted the achievement of new supramolecular systems containing a bioactive molecule and a chelating agent able to target tumor cells, as possible of diagnostic and therapeutic...|$|E

40|$|Rotaviruses are large, complex {{icosahedral}} particles {{consisting of}} three concentric capsid layers. When the innermost capsid protein VP 2 {{is expressed in}} the baculovirus-insect cell system it assembles as core-like particles. The amino terminus region of VP 2 is dispensable for assembly of virus-like particles (VLP). Coexpression of VP 2 and VP 6 produces double layered VLP. We hypothesized that the amino end of VP 2 could be extended without altering the auto assembly properties of VP 2. Using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or the DsRed protein as model inserts we {{have shown that the}} chimeric protein GFP (or DsRed) -VP 2 <b>auto</b> <b>assembles</b> perfectly well and forms fluorescent VLP (GFP-VLP 2 / 6 or DsRed-VLP 2 / 6) when coexpressed with VP 6. The presence of GFP inside the core does not prevent the assembly of the outer capsid layer proteins VP 7 and VP 4 to give VLP 2 / 6 / 7 / 4. Cryo-electron microscopy of purified GFP-VLP 2 / 6 showed that GFP molecules are located at the 5 -fold vertices of the core. It is possible to visualize a single fluorescent VLP in living cells by confocal fluorescent microscopy. In vitro VLP 2 / 6 did not enter into permissive cells or in dendritic cells. In contrast, fluorescent VLP 2 / 6 / 7 / 4 entered the cells and then the fluorescence signal disappear rapidly. Presented data indicate that fluorescent VLP are interesting tools to follow in real time the entry process of rotavirus and that chimeric VLP could be envisaged as “nanoboxes” carrying macromolecules to living cells...|$|R
