Big attention is given to anthocyanins, their characteristics, utilization in the food industry, factors that affect their stability and especially methods of determination. In conclusion, the theoretical part describes importance and methods of determination of vitamin C and antioxidant capacity. Selected nutritional parameters were determined in fifteen known and in three unknown varieties <b>of</b> <b>currants.</b> Anthocyanins were measured spectrophotometrically and determined by HPLC in color samples. By pH differential method was evaluated a content of monomeric and polymeric pigments. By HPLC method were identified individual anthocyanin pigments contained in fruits.

Based on the conidial morphology, two morphotypes (I and II) of C. gleosporioides were identified. Based on BLAST search of ITS regions and β-tubulin sequences, majority of the isolates showed 99 - 100 % similarity with Colletotrichum sp. from mango and other hosts and three isolates, 100 % similarity with C. asianum. From phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood method of combined datasets, the isolates from mango formed three clades, which corresponded to C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. asianum. Therefore, the present study showed that the isolates associated with <b>anthracnose</b> <b>of</b> mango belong to C. gleosporioides sensu lato and C. asianum...|$|R
