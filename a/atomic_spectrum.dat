30|$|In [1], the {{dictionary}} of <b>atomic</b> <b>spectra</b> was learned from audio examples. The learned dictionary comprised <b>atomic</b> <b>spectra,</b> {{which could be}} mapped back to pitches. This learned dictionary represents the basis vector, {{which could be used}} to factor out the transcribed notes.

From the learning process, a note may be represented by more than one <b>atomic</b> <b>spectra.</b> Furthermore, the mapping process between the pitches and the <b>atomic</b> <b>spectra</b> must still be done manually. In our approach, the matrix W of basis vectors is learned from each pitch from a desired instrument. This ensures that the basis vector (a.k.a. dictionary, Tone-model) represents the harmonic structure of each pitch at the expense of the basis vector matrix being applicable for that particular instrument only (e.g., the Tone-model learned from a piano will not work well with, for example, a violin). Many applications such as a performance analysis module in a guitar tutoring system, could benefit from this.|$|R

50|$|Light {{consists}} of electromagnetic radiation of different wavelengths. Therefore, when the elements or their compounds are heated either on a flame or by an electric arc they emit {{energy in the}} form of light. Analysis of this light, {{with the help of a}} spectroscope gives us a discontinuous spectrum. A spectroscope or a spectrometer is an instrument which is used for separating the components of light, which have different wavelengths. The spectrum appears in a series of lines called the line spectrum. This line spectrum is called an <b>atomic</b> <b>spectrum</b> when it originates from an atom in elemental form. Each element has a different <b>atomic</b> <b>spectrum.</b> The production of line spectra by the atoms of an element indicate that an atom can radiate only a certain amount of energy. This leads to the conclusion that bound electrons cannot have just any amount of energy but only a certain amount of energy.|$|E

40|$|In {{the late}} 1920 ’s and early 1930 ’s, {{physicists}} applied group representation theory to the quantum mechanics of <b>atomic</b> <b>spectra.</b> At the same time, physicists developed {{an alternative approach}} to theoretical <b>atomic</b> <b>spectra</b> that avoids using group theory. These two approaches exhibit nontrivial intellectual differences: the group theoretic approach provides {{a deeper understanding of}} many phenomena in <b>atomic</b> <b>spectra.</b> By focusing on derivations of selection rules for <b>atomic</b> <b>spectra,</b> I explicate one case where group theory enhances understanding. I refer to the non-group theoretic approach as the commutator approach; it serves as a benchmark for comparison. This case study motivates a deflationary account of mathematical explanations in science. According to my account, both group theoretic and commutator derivations explain selection rules for <b>atomic</b> <b>spectra.</b> I use these derivations to problematize stronger accounts of mathematical explanation that rely on a notion of relevance. Arguing that selection rules are an example of universality, I also criticize a strong interpretation of Batterman and Rice’s minimal model account of explanations of universality. After examining these accounts of explanation, I argue that explanatory criteria do not distinguish the intellectual content of the group theoretic and commutator approaches. Instead, I develop an account of scientific understanding that distinguishes these approaches based on organizational differences. Adopting terminology from Manders, I argue that these organizational differences arise from differences in the approach’s expressive means. Group theory reorganizes selection rule derivations by re-expressing physical concepts more effectively than the commutator approach. I argue that this superior organizational structure accounts for how group theory provides a heightened understanding of selection rules. ...|$|R

The speed of light has an exactly defined value in SI units, and the fine-structure constant can be determined more accurately (ur = [...] ) than the Planck constant. Thus, the uncertainty in the value of the electron rest mass is due entirely to the uncertainty in the value of the Planck constant (r2 > 0.999).|$|E
50|$|Niels Bohr {{introduced}} the first quantized {{model of the}} atom in 1913, {{in an attempt to}} overcome a major shortcoming of Rutherford's classical model. In classical electrodynamics, a charge moving in a circle should radiate electromagnetic radiation. If that charge were to be an electron orbiting a nucleus, the radiation would cause it to lose energy and spiral down into the nucleus. Bohr solved this paradox with explicit reference to Planck's work: an electron in a Bohr atom could only have certain defined energies Enwhere c0 is the speed of light in vacuum, R∞ is an experimentally determined constant (the Rydberg constant) and n is any integer (n = 1, 2, 3, …). Once the electron reached the lowest energy level (n = 1), it could not get any closer to the nucleus (lower energy). This approach also allowed Bohr to account for the Rydberg formula, an empirical description of the <b>atomic</b> <b>spectrum</b> of hydrogen, and to account for the value of the Rydberg constant R∞ in terms of other fundamental constants.|$|E
