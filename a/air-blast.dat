60|$|They went out, and as {{they did}} so a sudden glare of light sprang up. Tom, the donkey-man, had lighted the <b>air-blast</b> lamp he used when {{anything}} {{had to be done}} to pump or boiler at night, and its smoky radiance showed that Jefferson's shouts had roused the Spaniards. They were clustered, half dressed, about the head of the ladder which led to the bridge deck, with consternation in their shadowy faces, glancing at one another as though afraid to move a step further. Tom leaned against the rail, holding up the lamp, and the thing that had the shape of a man sat gibbering on a coil of hawser {{in the midst of the}} bridge deck.

60|$|Five {{minutes later}} Thurston, running across a bending plank, halted {{on the rock}} which served as {{foundation}} for the main bridge pier. Beside him Summers shouted confused orders {{to a group of}} struggling men. The moonlight beat down mistily through the haze that rose from the river, and Geoffrey could see the long wedge-headed timber framing that he had built, beside the wing on the shore-side, so that any trunk floating down would cannon off at an angle and shoot safely between the piers. But one huge fir had proved too long for the pass, and when its butt canted, the other end had driven athwart the point of the wedge, after which, because the river was black with drifting logs, other heavy trunks drove against it and jammed it fast. Panting men were hard at work with levers and pike-poles striving to wrench the massive trunk clear, and one lighted an <b>air-blast</b> flare, whose red glare flickered athwart the strip of water foaming between the piers. It showed that some of the logs forced up by the pressure were sliding out above the others, while, amid a horrible grinding, some sank. One side of the river was blocked by a mass of timber that was increasing every moment. Thurston feared that the unfinished piers could not long withstand the pressure, and he remembered that his own work would be paid for only on completion. Nevertheless, he passed several minutes in a critical survey, and then glanced towards certain groups of dark figures watching for the approaching ruin.|$|E

40|$|Longitudinal {{oscillations}} in <b>air-blasted</b> or air-assisted liquid sheets {{have been}} the subject of a large number of papers in the last 30 years. Frequency and sometimes amplitude are the main parameters used to characterize these oscillations. Attending to them, and also in dependence on the surface topology (e. g., the presence of perforations or ligaments), several oscillation modes have been described. In most works, two or at most three regimes are considered. Following these previous descriptions, this experimental work has found that some submodes can also be discerned. Based on visual observations, frequency measurements, and spray angle calculations, for some liquid and air flow rates up to six modes have been observed with defined transitions among them. The different modes are analyzed and characterized, and their presence is related to the flow conditions. © 2011 American Institute of Physics. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|This {{experimental}} study {{is devoted to}} the analysis of an <b>air-blasted</b> atomizer behavior whose air and liquid thicknesses are changed. Variation of liquid thickness is realized by modifying the injector inside; when for air thickness, wedges are introduced in the air flow duct.

Thickness of each fluid has not the same influence depending on each atomization process parameter. Breakup length is strongly correlated to liquid thickness; when frequency depend more on air thickness. But more than air thickness, for the frequency especially, the flow configuration plays the most significant role, through influence of boundary layer characteristics as wall shear stress.

After designing, the restoration is milled by the CAM module and sintered, according to a specially projected programme in accordance with the manufacturing demands. After clinical check-up, the restorations are glazed, <b>air-blasted</b> and cemented. Results: Setting up an individual protocol for working with CAD/CAM systems for restoring vital, severely devastated teeth with Zirconia indirect restorations. A research is made on 3 D digital scanning, occlusal and proximal modeling, virtual articulation, analyzing the incline of the cavity walls, the thickness of the restoration and the possibilities for restoring the anatomy of the tooth according to patient’s individual characteristics of the teeth’s arch. Conclusion: The scanning and design process should be evaluated with the same quality control as when using traditional methods. The CAD software requires excellent preparation of the tooth cavity and digital scanning.

Three disc-shaped high-alumina specimens (In-Ceram Alumina, INC) and 4 glassy-matrix ceramic specimens (Vitadur Alpha, V) (diameter: 5 mm and height: 5 mm) were manufactured. INC specimens were submitted to 3 different surface conditioning methods: INC 1 - Polishing with silicon carbide papers (SiC); INC 2 - Chairside air-borne particle abrasion (50 µm Al 2 O 3); INC 3 - Chairside silica coating (CoJet; 30 µm SiOx). Vitadur Alpha (V) specimens were subjected to 4 different surface conditioning methods: V 1 - Polishing with SiC papers; V 2 - HF acid etching; V 3 - Chairside air-borne particle abrasion (50 µm Al 2 O 3); V 4 - Chairside silica coating (30 µm SiOx). Following completion of the surface conditioning methods, the specimens were analyzed using SEM. After polishing with SiC, the surfaces of V specimens remained relatively smooth while those of INC exhibited topographic irregularities. Chairside air-abrasion with either aluminum oxide or silica particles produced retentive patterns on both INC and V specimens, with smoother patterns observed after silica coating.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical {{study has been}} performed to improve {{the understanding of the}} air/liquid interaction in an <b>air-blasted</b> breaking water sheet. This research is focused in the near field close to the exit slit, because it is in this region where instabilities develop and grow, leading to the sheet breakup. In the experiments, several relevant parameters were measured including the sheet oscillation frequency and wavelength, as well as the droplet size distribution and the amplification growth rate. The flow was also investigated using linear instability theory. In the context of existing papers on instability analysis, the numerical part of this work presents two unique features. First, the air boundary layer is taken into account, and the effects of air and liquid viscosity are revealed. Second, the equations are solved for the same parameter values as those in the experiments, enabling a direct comparison between calculations and measurements; although qualitatively the behaviour of the measured variables is properly described, quantitative agreement is not satisfactory. Limitations of the instability analysis in describing this problem are discussed. From all the collected data, it is confirmed that the oscillation frequency strongly depends on the air speed due to the near-nozzle air/water interaction. The wave propagates with accelerating interface velocity which in our study ranges between the velocity of the water and twice that value, depending on the air velocity. For a fixed water velocity, the oscillation frequency varies linearly with the air velocity. This behaviour can only be explained if the air boundary layer is considered.
