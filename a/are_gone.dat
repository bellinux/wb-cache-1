5|$|When {{returning}} to the Red Queen's chamber, Kaplan {{points out that the}} four bodies of the group's dead crew from the Glass Hallway Trap sequence <b>are</b> <b>gone.</b> This is a reference to the games, where the bodies of enemies disappear. When the survivors make their escape from the Hive with a countdown as they fight the final boss, this is a reference to the Resident Evil game which ends with a five-minute countdown, during which the boss must be defeated.|$|E
5|$|A level ends {{when all}} of the point-scoring objects <b>are</b> <b>gone</b> - either lost down the drain, cleaned by sponges/brushes, eaten by roaches, or absorbed by the bubble. At this point, if the bubble is large enough to have a {{complete}} face, the player moves on to the next level; otherwise, one life is lost and the level must be replayed. In addition, whenever the bubble has a face, the drain flashes green, giving the player a chance to enter it and skip the next level. Entering the drain while the bubble is too small costs one life.|$|E
5|$|Californium {{can enter}} the body from ingesting {{contaminated}} food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be deposited in the skeleton, 25% in the liver, and the rest in other organs, or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver <b>are</b> <b>gone</b> in 50 and 20 years, respectively. Californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone.|$|E

5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{consists of}} setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game– for example, {{where to place}} different pieces– while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These {{two parts of the}} chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play. A game of chess is normally divided into three phases: opening, typically the first 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; then middlegame; and last the endgame, when most of the pieces <b>are</b> <b>gone,</b> kings typically take a more active part in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.|$|E
5|$|Chris hates {{being in}} the Youth Scouts and wants to quit, but is afraid to tell his father Peter. Chris is finally kicked out when he runs over the troop leader during a Soap Box Derby. Peter insists on driving Chris {{and the rest of}} the family (Peter's wife Lois, their {{daughter}} Meg and their infant Stewie) to the Youth Scout headquarters, in Manhattan, to get Chris readmitted. While they <b>are</b> <b>gone,</b> their talking dog Brian is watching Nova just as the show is interrupted to show several episodes of the sitcom One Day at a Time. He tries to change the channel, but is unable to do so (nor he can turn the TV off), losing his intelligence shortly after watching a few episodes.|$|E
5|$|During the {{daylight}} hours, Jericho's powers <b>are</b> <b>gone,</b> {{so he has}} to fight as a normal human, using a wide variety of weaponry, from a Darkwatch's standard-issue 24-shot Redeemer handgun to a crossbow firing explosive arrows and a rocket launcher, as well as melee combat. In some missions, Jericho can drive a Gatling gun-equipped Coyote Steamwagon vehicle; using it or a horse changes perspective to the third-person view. During horse-riding rail shooter sequences, Jericho is granted unlimited ammunition and high attack speed, at the cost of only being able to use the Redeemer.|$|E

5|$|Ganymede is {{composed}} primarily of silicate rock and water ice, and a salt-water ocean {{is believed to}} exist nearly 200km below Ganymede's surface, sandwiched between layers of ice. The metallic core of Ganymede suggests a greater heat {{at some time in}} its past than had previously been proposed. The surface is a mix of two types of terrain—highly cratered dark regions and younger, but still ancient, regions with a large array of grooves and ridges. Ganymede has a high number of craters, but many <b>are</b> <b>gone</b> or barely visible due to its icy crust forming over them. The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone), and some atomic hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|In Alexandria, Virginia, sixteen-year-old Dara Kernof (Emily Perkins), a {{severely}} {{mentally and physically}} disabled girl confined to a wheelchair, somehow manages to leave her house {{in the middle of}} the night, soon after her baptism. Her father, Lance (Eric Keenleyside), finds her {{in the middle of the}} street, with her arms raised upward, kneeling before a Dark Figure. Suddenly, lightning flashes and the Dark Figure disappears. When Lance reaches Dara, he realizes she is dead and that her eyes <b>are</b> <b>gone,</b> as if having been burned out of their sockets.|$|E
5|$|John and Kanyenke {{return and}} drive Warwick's forces from Brunswick, but Warwick and Stuart <b>are</b> <b>gone.</b> John {{realizes that the}} Circle of Ossus has returned. Kanyenke {{believes}} that his sister, Nonahkee, could be in danger, too, and the pair leaves for New England. Kanyenke's suspicions prove correct and they confront Warwick again when he attacks Nonahkee's village hoping to extract John's location from her. After the battle it is revealed that John Black and Nonahkee are in love, but are keeping it a secret from Kanyenke until a more peaceful time, although it is seen that Kanyenke is aware of this.|$|E

5|$|Leslie asks April (Aubrey Plaza) {{to check}} on a {{budgeting}} request while they <b>are</b> <b>gone.</b> What should be a simple chore, however, has April waiting on hold at the phone for hours. When she desperately has to use the restroom, Andy agrees to wait by the phone. When she returns, the two start to bond by making up their own lyrics to the hold music, playing a non-water game of Marco Polo around the office, and seeing who can make the best spit-take. When Andy says he is jealous that his ex-girlfriend Ann (Rashida Jones) {{is going to the}} hunting trip with Mark, April offers to give him a hickey to make Ann jealous, which Andy accepts.|$|E
5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object permanence, which explains why they do not cry when their mothers <b>are</b> <b>gone</b> ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing at a place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E
5|$|What is a boy? He is {{a person}} who is going to carry on what you have started, to sit where you are sitting and, when you <b>are</b> <b>gone,</b> attend to those things you think are so important. You can adopt all the {{policies}} you please, but how they will be carried on depends on him. Even if you make leagues and treaties, he will have to manage them. He will assume control of your cities and nations. He is going to move on and take over your prisons, churches, schools, universities and corporations.|$|E

60|$|Then said Mr. Godly-Fear again, 'I {{may well}} be sad, for Emmanuel <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> from Mansoul. I say again, he <b>is</b> <b>gone,</b> and you, sir, are the man that has driven him away; yea, he <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> {{without so much as}} acquainting the nobles of Mansoul with his going; and if that is not a sign of his anger, I am not acquainted with the methods of godliness.|$|R
5|$|Wildflowers bloom {{from early}} May to late September but most <b>are</b> <b>gone</b> by late August. Moisture from snow-melt {{along with some}} {{rainfall}} in late spring kick-starts the germination of annual plants, including wildflowers. Most of these plants complete their entire life cycle in the few months each year that moisture levels are good. The onset of summer decreases the number of wildflowers and by autumn only the tiny yellow flowers of sagebrush and rabbitbrush remain. Some wildflowers that grow {{in the area are}} the arrow-leaved balsamroot, bitterroot, blazingstar, desert parsley, dwarf monkeyflower, paintbrush, scorpionweed, scabland penstemon and the wild onion.|$|E
5|$|Mulder visits Max's trailer {{again and}} looks through his mail, finding a luggage claim ticket. Scully visits Sharon, {{now in a}} mental institution, who tells Scully that she stole {{technology}} from her employer that Max believed was alien. The device was in three parts, one which she had, one that he brought {{on the plane and}} a third one. Mulder uses the claim ticket to obtain the third device at a New York airport and heads on a plane to return to Washington. Garrett, who is also aboard, sits next to him. Mulder soon realizes who Garrett is and holds him at gunpoint. Garrett does not care, telling Mulder that if he shoots him the plane will depressurize and {{he will be able to}} escape with a parachute he has with him. Mulder imprisons Garrett in the airplane bathroom but Garrett soon emerges with a zip gun and orders him to hand over the device. Suddenly the plane starts shaking and bright lights shine in through the windows. When the plane touches down and Mulder gets out both Garrett and the device <b>are</b> <b>gone</b> and Mulder is missing nine minutes, having no memory of what happened. The agents visit Sharon one last time in Max's trailer and say goodbye.|$|E
5|$|There is {{reliance}} on repetition of themes within {{the plot of}} Thalaba. Three times he attained a paradise {{that turns out to}} be false, and this is followed by the death of a woman who <b>are</b> <b>gone</b> until the very end when Thalaba is awarded entrance into a true paradise. The seeking out of mythic figures to guide him onto the next part of the tale is equally repetitive and has little result for the plot. Various instances of the sorcerers and sorceresses are added to the story to emphasise the evil of magic along with tempting Thalaba with power. However, the emphasis on magic hides the moral within Thalaba's temptations. Although Thalaba does achieve his goal through moral submission, many of the quests and actions are arbitrary and repetitive. As such, they take away from any Islamic truth that could be found within the actions.|$|E

5|$|Tony wanders in {{delirium}} {{until he}} is rescued by Mr. Todd, who rules over a small native tribe in a remote clearing in the jungle. Todd nurses Tony back to health. Although illiterate, Todd owns copies of the complete works of Charles Dickens, and asks Tony to read to him. However, when Tony's health recovers and he asks to be helped on his way, the old man repeatedly demurs. The readings continue, but the atmosphere becomes increasingly menacing as Tony realises he is being held against his will. When a search party finally reaches the settlement, Todd arranges that Tony be drugged and kept hidden; he tells the party that Tony has died, and gives them his watch to take home. When Tony awakes he learns that his hopes of rescue <b>are</b> <b>gone,</b> {{and that he is}} condemned to read Dickens to his captor indefinitely. Back in England, Tony's death is accepted; Hetton passes to his cousins, who erect a memorial to his memory, while Brenda marries Tony's friend Jock Grant-Menzies.|$|E
