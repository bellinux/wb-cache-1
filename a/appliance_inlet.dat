50|$|Selection of a coupler {{depends in}} part on the IEC {{appliance}} classes. The shape and dimensions of appliance inlets and connectors are coordinated so that a connector with lower current rating, temperature rating, or polarization cannot be inserted into an <b>appliance</b> <b>inlet</b> that requires higher ratings. (i.e. a Protection Class II connector cannot mate with a Class I inlet which requires an earth); whereas connecting a Class I to a Class II <b>appliance</b> <b>inlet</b> is possible because it creates no safety hazard.|$|E
50|$|The {{dimensions}} and tolerances for connectors and <b>appliance</b> <b>inlets</b> are given in standard sheets, which are dimensioned drawings showing the features required for safety and interchangeability.|$|R
40|$|Two-phase {{separation}} {{offers an}} increase in refrigeration system efficiency with {{the added benefit of}} using a passive component. Although, a large amount research has been established in the refrigeration field for high mass flux systems, there is still ample opportunity to expand this application and knowledge in the refrigeration home appliances sector which require lower mass flux. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the design of liquid-vapor gravity separators for low mass flux systems (1. 5 â€“ 3. 5 Â lbm/ft^ 2 hr). In the experimental method, the independent parameters varied were: Inlet Quality, Inlet Pressure, Inlet Mass Flow, Top Branch Flow Ratio and Separator Geometry. The dependent parameter was determined as, x_ 2, the Outlet Vapor Branch Quality. The two separator geometries which were designed, fabricated, and tested varied in aspect ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the height to the body diameter of the separator. The aspect ratio of the first geometry was 10, and it consisted of a tall separator height (4. 125 in) with a narrow separator body diameter (0. 423 in). The second geometry had an aspect ratio of 2, and it consisted of a short separator height (1. 75 in) with a wide separator body diameter (0. 742 in). The separator body was made of clear PVC tubing material in order visualize the flow conditions at different operating points. The results of the study showed that both geometries perform similarly. At low and high liquid Reynolds number, the flows characteristically show no significant vapor shearing and no vapor exiting through the liquid branch, as long as a liquid build-up was visually present in the separator; this indicates that vapor phase momentum is not high enough to penetrate through the high bulk viscosity of the liquid phase. Therefore, evaluating the vapor quality through the vapor branch was explicitly carried out by assuming the vapor quality through the liquid branch as 0. Thus, the results indicate that the primary factor to influence separation in this study was the balance maintained between the inlet quality and top branch flow ratio. Overall, separation was not highly sensitive to the rest of the factors in the tested ranges applicable to small scale refrigeration <b>appliances.</b> When <b>inlet</b> quality was greater than top branch flow ratio, no clear liquid-vapor interface was present and the mixture entering the separator was characteristic of misty flow, thus no liquid buildup was found within the separator. Â However when the inlet quality was less than the top branch flow ratio, the liquid-vapor interface was visible and a liquid build-up was observed within the separator vessel...|$|R
50|$|A {{removable}} {{power cord}} is similar but much shorter, {{and is designed}} to connect an appliance to a mains outlet. The female end mates with an <b>appliance</b> <b>inlet.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Each type of coupler is {{identified}} by a standard sheet number. For appliance couplers {{this consists of}} the letter [...] "C" [...] followed by a number, where the standard sheet for the male <b>appliance</b> <b>inlet</b> is 1 higher than the sheet for the corresponding female cable connector. Many types of coupler also have common names. The most common ones are IEC connector for the common C13 and C14, the figure-8 connector for C7 and C8, and cloverleaf connector or Mickey Mouse connector for the C5/C6. Kettle plug is a colloquial term used for the high-temperature C16 <b>appliance</b> <b>inlet</b> (and sometimes, wrongly, for the mating C15 female connector). [...] "Kettle plug" [...] is sometimes mistakenly {{used to refer to}} regular temperature-rated C13 and C14 connectors, which should not be used with heating appliances.|$|E
50|$|Pin {{temperature}} is measured where the pin projects from the engagement surface. The maximum permitted pin temperatures, are 70 °C, 120 °C, and 155 °C, respectively (the higher temperatures {{are not applicable}} to interconnection couplers). The pin {{temperature is}} determined by the design of the appliance, and its interior temperature, rather than by its ambient temperature. Typical applications with increased pin temperatures include appliances with heating coils such as ovens or electric grills. It is generally possible to use a connector with a higher rated temperature with a lower rated <b>appliance</b> <b>inlet,</b> but the keying feature of the inlet prevents use of a connector with a lower temperature rating.|$|E
5000|$|IEC 60320-3: Standard {{sheets and}} gauges. [...] This part {{includes}} the standard sheets for both appliance couplers and interconnection couplers. For appliance couplers the various coupler outlines are designated {{using a combination}} of letters and numbers, e.g., [...] "C14". The female part connector supplies power to the male <b>appliance</b> <b>inlet.</b> The male part is designated by the even number one greater than the number assigned to the female part, so a C1 connector mates with a C2 inlet, and a C15A mates with a C16A. Interconnection couplers have single letter designators, e.g., [...] "F". They consist of two parts: a plug connector, which is the part integral with, or intended to be attached to, the cord, and an appliance outlet, which is the part integrated or incorporated in the appliance or equipment or intended to be fixed to it, and from which the supply is obtained.|$|E
