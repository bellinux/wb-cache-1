5|$|A {{few months}} later, Olbers was again {{attempting}} to locate Ceres {{when he noticed}} another moving object in the vicinity.

When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380km in diameter.

5|$|Free cobalt (the native metal) is {{not found}} on Earth because of {{oxygen in the}} {{atmosphere}} and chlorine in the ocean.

Though the element is of medium abundance, natural compounds of cobalt are numerous. Small amounts of cobalt compounds are found in most rocks, soil, plants, and animals.|$|E

For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure.
