40|$|Routing {{overlays}} aim {{to accomplish}} {{some of the}} anticipated <b>advanced</b> <b>routing</b> <b>features</b> of the Future Internet [1]. First, {{they are expected to}} achieve higher reliability than the current Internet by bridging between different AS and providing alternative routes in case of failures [2]. Second, routing overlays can implement interdomain performance management when choosing appropriate intermediary nodes. In this way, they overcome the deficiencies of the default Internet routing. For example, they can conceal severe Triangle Inequality Violations (TIVs), which are present in up to 30 % of typical Internet paths [3]. Third, routing overlays scale well when a small set of randomly chosen intermediaries is used for the indirect routing [4]. Forth, routing overlays enable edge-based control on the transmission quality when source routing mechanisms are applied [5] and permit the easy integration multiple network into a single physical structure [6]. While most routing overlay concepts aim for single path transmissions, concurrent multipath transmissions within routing overlays can combine these advantages more efficiently. For example, re-transmissions of lost packets can be conducted immediately and can be performed on more reliable paths. Similarly, parts of information can be transmitted on paths that more appropriately engineered, e. g. MPEG’s I-frames are transmitted on more reliable paths than its P- or B-frames...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{evaluation}} of <b>advanced</b> <b>routing</b> algorithms for content-based publish/subscribe systems {{that focuses on the}} inherent characteristics of routing algorithms (routing table sizes and filter forwarding overhead) instead of system-specific parameters (CPU load etc.). The evaluation is based on a working prototype instead of simulations and compares several routing algorithms to each other. Moreover, the effects of locality among the interests of the consumers are investigated. The results offer new insights into the behavior of content-based <b>routing</b> algorithms: Firstly, <b>advanced</b> <b>routing</b> algorithms can be considered mandatory in large-scale publish/subscribe systems. Secondly, the use of advertisements considerably improves the scalability. Thirdly, <b>advanced</b> <b>routing</b> algorithms operate efficiently in more dynamic environments than was previously thought. Finally, the good behavior of the algorithms even improves if the interests of the consumers are not evenly distributed, which can be expected in practice...|$|R

It is a user-friendly software with an <b>advanced</b> <b>routing</b> and scheduling algorithm to automate and aid the operational decision making process. It considers the key operations constraints faced by the tanker owners. The <b>advanced</b> <b>routing</b> and scheduling algorithm embedded in the decision engine uses heuristics to solve industrial scale problems under actual operating conditions. Besides, TOPS can easily generate the routing, scheduling, stowage plan and the financial reports, and it can process {{a large number of}} orders online as well. In addition, TOPS can be conveniently modified for evaluation purposes or to suit the preference of the tanker owners. In essence, TOPS is an effective optimization-based decision support system to assist the parcel tanker carriers to systematically and objectively plan vessel routes and schedules with the goal of maximizing profits and fleet utilization in a structured manner. Drawing from actual data provided by a tanker company operating in the Asia Pacific, our simulation results show that TOPS can generate a cost effective routing and scheduling plan of a large scale problem to within a practically acceptable time of around 10 - 20 minutes...|$|R
