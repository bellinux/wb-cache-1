Crane had been travelling with a female companion, who {{was shot in the}} hand, but police determined that the incident was a [...] "direct attack" [...] on Crane's life, who {{was shot in the head}}, leg, chest and arm. It later emerged that Crane had been expected to testify in the murder case against Saat and a source close to Crane said that she knew too much, being able to identify and implicate a number of figures in the Saat murder case. She was the third state witness in the Saadt murder trial to be murdered; Giulio Bascelli was shot in the head in a deserted garage soon after Avassi's death in 1999 and Carlo Binne {{was shot dead}} at the Gecko Lounge, a Johannesburg nightclub, in April 2001. Prior to her death, Crane was working with a British journalist, David Kray on her memoirs. The biography, Hazel Crane: Testimony from Beyond the Grave received a posthumous release in 2004 and contained several shocking details about the socialite's colourful past. The book details Crane's own secret life of crime. She made her fortune by smuggling diamonds and emeralds, making blackmarket currency deals, owning a striptease joint and selling hard-core pornography. She also tells of how she would tuck emeralds into her beehive hairdo or pack them into her son's nappies for smuggling.
