50|$|Mesa {{experienced}} {{difficulties with}} its other two codeshares as well. Flight crew shortages and scheduling problems {{resulted in the}} cancellation of many flights. From October 1997 to January 1998, Mesa parked aircraft and canceled flights to alleviate the crew shortage problem. Part of the crew shortage problem {{was related to the}} consolidation of flight operations in Farmington, and the training associated with transitioning the <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>from</b> a Part 135 operator to a Part 121 operator as required by a FAA mandate. America West canceled its codeshare with Mesa in 1997.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the case}} of Denise McDonagh v Ryanair Ltd (C-12/11), the Third Chamber of the European Court of Justice ruled that natural {{disasters}} such as the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull and the subsequent cloud of volcanic ash in 2010, which shut down most European air traffic, do constitute [...] "extraordinary circumstances" [...] that release <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> <b>from</b> the obligation to pay compensation, but {{that there is no}} such category as [...] "super-extraordinary circumstances" [...] that would release them from the obligation to provide care. According to the court's ruling, <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> continued to have an obligation of care towards passengers under Art. 5 and 8 of the regulation during the week-long shutdown of European airspace, and this obligation does not have a temporal or monetary limit.|$|R

25|$|In February 2008, {{the carrier}} {{acquired}} two de Havilland Canada Dash DHC 8-Q311s. In December 2008, the Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA) withdrew Air Tanzania's Air Operator Certificate because the airline {{had failed to}} meet the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization. Two weeks later, the International Air Transport Association banned the <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>from</b> all aviation transactions and informed all travel agencies and other aviation companies to stop all transactions with Air Tanzania until further notice. The certificate was restored in January 2009, with both the TCAA and Air Tanzania claiming there had never been any doubt about the airworthiness of its aircraft.

50|$|In 1978, Japan allowed China Airlines {{to return}} to Tokyo International Airport at Haneda after {{relocating}} all other airlines at the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita, leaving China Airlines as the sole international operator at Haneda, {{which at the time}} was an exclusive domestic facility. The premise being that <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> <b>from</b> the PRC and Taiwan were prevented crossing paths at any Japanese airports. Thus CAL's Osaka service, due to the city's only airport at Itami, would not be reinstated until years later. The crossing of flag-carriers (Taiwan based-airlines and Mainland China PRC based-airlines) occurred almost hourly at then British-controlled Hong Kong's Kaitak International Airport. Adversely, other regional airports such as Bangkok, Singapore and Manila were entirely spared of this indignity imposed on Japan by China.|$|R
5000|$|According to the February 1, 1976 {{edition of}} the North American Official Airline Guide (OAG), Sun Valley Key Airlines was {{operating}} scheduled passenger flights as a commuter <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>from</b> Salt Lake City (SLC) {{to a number of}} destinations in California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada and Utah. [...] These flights primarily served smaller communities in the region; however, service was also flown into larger cities such as Boise, ID (BOI), Grand Junction, CO (GJT), Oakland, CA (OAK) and Reno, NV (RNO). The primary aircraft types used for these flights were small Piper Cherokee and Piper Navajo prop airplanes although larger de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and Convair 440 aircraft were also being flown at this time between Salt Lake City and Sun Valley, ID (SUN) as well as between Boise and Sun Valley.|$|R

25|$|Brussels Airlines began {{trying to}} set up a {{regional}} airline in DR Congo in 2007. DR Congo used to be Belgian Congo and has strong business and political ties with Belgium. In that year, airDC was founded as a joint venture with Hewa Bora Airways, and the launch of commercial regional flights from Kinshasa-N'djili Airport using a fleet of BAe 146-200s handed over by Brussels Airlines was planned for early 2008. Concerns about the success of the project were voiced in 2008, when the disaster of Hewa Bora Airways Flight 122 revealed serious aviation safety flaws in the DR Congo. As a consequence, Hewa Bora was banned from operating within the European Union (any <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> <b>from</b> the DR Congo had already been included in the EU blacklist since 2006 due to a lack or regulatory oversight in the country, but there had been an exception for Hewa Bora's Brussels service). The airDC project was postponed indefinitely and eventually abandoned.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to study}} and analyse the impact of oil price shock on the share prices of airline companies in East Asia, in particular international <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> <b>from</b> Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia by looking at how the companies‘ share prices respond to the news of oil shocks. The companies involved {{in this study were}} Japan Airlines ("JAL"), All Nippon Airways ("ANA"), Cathay Pacific Airways ("Cathay"), Korean Air ("KAL"), Malaysian Airlines ("MAS") and Singapore Airlines ("SIA"). The time period covered in this study was from the year 1973 to year 2004. In view that investors‘ perception of future earnings of a company and its risk level are reflected in the stock prices, a company‘s stock price will increase or decrease, depending on how investors perceive an event will affect the company‘s value (Wells, 2004). In addition to studying the reaction of airlines‘ stock prices to the news of oil shock, it is also the aim of this dissertation to examine whether the airline companies under consideration over or under-perform their respective stock markets...|$|R
5000|$|In 1971 Britt Airways {{purchased}} a small fleet of Beechcraft 99 light turboprop airliners and by late 1975 these were operated under contract as Allegheny Commuter flights {{on behalf of}} Allegheny Airlines. [...] According to the October 29, 1978 Britt Airways system timetable, commuter flights for Allegheny were operated by Britt from the airline's small hub located at Chicago O'Hare Airport (ORD) with service to Bloomington, IN, Danville, IL, Indianapolis, IN, Muncie, IN and Terre Haute, IN. [...] In 1979, Britt was continuing to serve these aforementioned destinations as an Allegheny Commuter <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>from</b> Chicago and was also flying independently operated service to Bloomington, IL/Normal, IL, Champaign, IL/Urbana, IL, Evansville, IN, Galesburg, IL, Indianapolis, IN, Moline, IL, Peoria, IL, St. Louis, MO, Springfield, IL and Sterling, IL/Rock Falls, IL with flights primarily operated from Chicago O'Hare {{as well as an}} Indianapolis-Evansville-St. Louis route and an Indianapolis-Champaign/Urbana route. [...] All Allegheny Commuter as well as independently operated services were being flown with Beechcraft 99 and Swearingen Metroliner (Metro II model) turboprops at this time. [...] By 1980, the airline had expanded its hub operation at Chicago O'Hare with new service to Decatur, IL, Mattoon, IL/Charleston, IL, and South Bend, IN, and had also expanded its fleet with the addition of larger Fairchild Hiller FH-227 turboprops.|$|R
40|$|Low Cost Carriers (LCCs) have {{dramatically}} changed the market of air transportation. Before {{the beginning of}} LCCs operation, there where only Full Service Carriers (FSCs). The LCCs have quickly expanded worldwide. In Brazil they appeared in the 1990 s in commuters flights, forcing a great competition. In 2001 the first Brazilian LCC (Gol Transporte Aéreo Ltda) begins to fly. The increase of the air transportation sector competition forced the companies to change from an operational management to a business management. In this study, we analysed the Brazilian <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> performance <b>from</b> 2001 to 2005. We used Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Fuzzy Sets to analyse the air careers efficiency.

30|$|Restrictions {{on foreign}} entry, other discriminatory measures, and {{barriers}} to competition {{are the most}} relevant policy areas in the computation of the air transport STRI. For the Swiss air industry, barriers to entry and competition are the most relevant restrictions. For instance, only companies that are majority-owned and controlled by Switzerland, member states of the European Union, or their nationals are granted an operating license (Art. 4 (f) EC Regulation No 1008 / 2008). This provision contributes crucially to the score of the category restrictions on foreign entry. Furthermore, policy measures regarding the exemption of <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> alliances <b>from</b> competition law and slot allocation systems are assessed as restrictive in the policy area barriers to competition. By law, <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> are allowed to combine air services and to enter into code share arrangements (Art. 15 EC Regulation No 1008 / 2008). In addition, they may retain already allocated slots from one season to the next (Art. 8 EC Regulation No 793 / 2004).|$|R

40|$|Our {{intended}} {{topic is}} a general discussion of {{the basic elements of}} liability related to airline accidents to which fully automated cockpits have constituted an associated contributory factor. In addition we addressed the liability of <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> arising <b>from</b> injuries or death caused to passengers traveling on international flights. For this purpose, we reviewed the Warsaw System and the different international instruments that constitute it. We also reviewed principles of common law applicable to aircraft manufacturers and the "Free Flight" {{as an example of the}} growing automation environment, which {{is a general}} benefit to commercial aviation but also a likely contributory cause for accidents in particular cases. In the last part we briefly discuss a personal view regarding the interplay between manufacturers and airlines under the 1999 Montreal Convention, which is an international treaty unifying the desegregated Warsaw System into one single instrument that is expected to enter into force in a few years...|$|R
