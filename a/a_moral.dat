5|$|Ethicist Tom Regan {{rejected}} Kant's {{assessment of}} the moral worth of animals on three main points: First, he rejected Kant's claim that animals are not self-conscious. He then challenged Kant's claim that animals have no intrinsic moral worth because they cannot make <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> judgment. Regan argued that, if a being's moral worth is determined by its ability to make <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> judgment, then we must regard humans who are incapable of moral thought as being equally undue moral consideration. Regan finally argued that Kant's assertion that animals exist merely {{as a means to}} an end is unsupported; the fact that animals have a life that can go well or badly suggests that, like humans, they have their own ends.|$|E

40|$|Are there good {{grounds for}} {{thinking}} that the moral values of action are {{to be derived from}} those of character? This ‘virtue ethical’ claim is sometimes thought of as a kind of normative ethical theory; sometimes as form of opposition to any such theory. However, the best case to be made for it supports neither of these claims. Rather, it leads us to a distinctive view in moral epistemology: the view that my warrant for <b>a</b> particular <b>moral</b> judgement derives from my warrant for believing that I am <b>a</b> good <b>moral</b> judge. This view seems to confront a regress-problem. For the belief that I am <b>a</b> good <b>moral</b> judge is itself <b>a</b> particular <b>moral</b> judgement. So it seems that, on this view, I need to derive my warrant for believing that I am <b>a</b> good <b>moral</b> judge from my warrant for believing that I am a good judge of moral judges; and so on. I show how this worry can be met, and trace the implications of the resulting view for warranted moral judgement. Garrett Cullit...|$|R

5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that animals have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them.
