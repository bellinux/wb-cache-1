5|$|Ramanujan was {{mentioned}} in the 1997 film Good Will Hunting, in <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) explains to Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) the genius of Will Hunting (Matt Damon) by comparing him to Ramanujan.|$|E

5|$|The Siege of Constantinople is {{mentioned}} in Stephenie Meyer's novel Breaking Dawn by the character Kate. In <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> the immortals share their war stories, Kate implies {{that she and}} her sisters aided in the battle and led Oleg to victory.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the general}} effects of {{invasive}} animals {{is not as}} profound as plants, they are more noticeable in many instances and {{a constant reminder of}} the many exotic species in the region. A wildlife biologist and several construction workers near Homestead Air Force Base witnessed <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> several iguanas sunning themselves in a canal were attacked by a spectacled caiman, to the surprise of all.|$|E
5|$|In Tempo magazine, Kurie Suditomo {{wrote that}} Ruma Maida {{intertwined}} several sub-plots, including {{the depiction of}} the 1928 Youth Conference, the education of street children, and <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> Sakera discusses architecture with Muchlisin; the review stated that these detracted from the film's comprehensibility. Jakarta Globe reviewer Armando Siahaan noted that several plot lines run parallel, including riots following the Japanese surrender in 1945 and those in May 1998.|$|E
50|$|The song is also {{featured}} in the 2016 films Norm of the North and Bad Moms. The usage of the former (where it was used in <b>a</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>where</b> the population of New York is dancing) {{has been criticized for}} not fitting with the scene considering the lyrics in the song.|$|R

5|$|They {{decided to}} have <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> Lisa and Bart visit Homer before his surgery and were unsure of how to do it, so they {{approached}} Brooks. Brooks made up the entire scene on the spot. Originally, the surgery {{was supposed to be}} performed by Dr. Hibbert, but it was later changed to Dr. Nick. In the original airing of the episode, Dr. Nick's phone number was the number of a real legal clinic, whose lawyers made them change it to 1-600-DOCTORB.|$|E
5|$|While Star Trek {{in general}} {{features}} few overt references to religion, {{there is a}} clear recognition that a laying aside of past hurts is necessary for peace, similar to the concept of shalom in Judaism. Shatner regretted that Kirk's angst at being outmoded was minimized in the final print. <b>A</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> Spock asks Kirk if they have grown so old and inflexible they have outlived their usefulness had two meanings: it was as much Nimoy asking Shatner as it was their characters.|$|E
5|$|After the Ashton Canal {{closed in}} the 1960s, {{it was decided to}} turn the Portland Basin {{warehouse}} into a museum. In 1985, {{the first part of the}} Heritage Centre and Museum opened on the first floor of the warehouse. The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the Ashton Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet. It has been used several times as a filming location for Coronation Street, including <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{scenes in}} Cannibal Holocaust {{have also been}} noted as being similar to scenes in Antonio Climati's Mondo film Savana violenta, {{specifically}} the scene in which Monroe bathes naked in {{the river and the}} scene of the forced abortion rite. The cinéma vérité style used heavily in Cannibal Holocaust was also used before in Climati's first Mondo film, Ultime grida dalla savana, in <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> a tourist is attacked and killed by a pride of lions. Another scene, in which a native man is captured, tortured, and murdered by mercenaries in South America, uses a similar filming style, and both scenes may have been influential on Deodato's direction.|$|E
5|$|Mentmore Towers {{was chosen}} from twenty {{different}} locations for Wayne Manor, as Nolan and Crowley liked its white floors, {{which gave the}} impression of the manor as a memorial to Wayne's parents. The building chosen to represent Arkham Asylum was the National Institute for Medical Research building in Mill Hill, northwest London, England. The St Pancras railway station and the Abbey Mills Pumping Stations were used for Arkham's interiors. University College London was used for courtrooms. Some scenes, including the Tumbler pursuit, were filmed in Chicago at locations such as Lower Wacker Drive and 35 East Wacker. Authorities agreed to raise Franklin Street Bridge for <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> access to the Narrows is closed.|$|E
5|$|Ottman {{said the}} {{challenge}} on Valkyrie {{was to create}} tension from dialogue scenes, and he often reshaped scenes to do this: moments rather than whole scenes were cut from the film. Being historically accurate meant Ottman was more restricted in reorganizing scenes, but {{he was able to}} choose what lines and close-ups he could focus on. Ottman said the scene he was most saddened to delete was <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> von Stauffenberg dances with his wife because he had been looking forward to scoring it.|$|E

5|$|Peter Hall's 1974 film Akenfield (from the 1969 book by Ronald Blythe) {{contains}} <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> {{the grandfather}} {{as a young}} man is reaping a cornfield. He weeps when he accidentally crushes a bird's egg, an image derived from Bewick's tail-piece woodcut for the partridge. The woodcut shows a reaper with a scythe, a dead bird and its nest of a dozen eggs on the ground under the scythe, which has just lifted. George Ewart Evans used the image on the title page of his 1956 book about Blaxhall (near Charsfield, on which 'Akenfield' is probably partly based).|$|E
5|$|Producer Frank Marshall {{stated in}} 2003 {{that the film}} would use {{traditional}} stunt work {{so as to be}} consistent with the previous films. CGI was used to remove the visible safety wires on the actors when they did their stunts (such as when Indy swings on a lamp with his whip). Timed explosives were used for <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> Indiana drives a truck through crates. During the take, an explosive failed to detonate and landed in the seat beside Ford. It did not go off and he was not injured.|$|E
5|$|The Agni's Philosophy tech demo {{was running}} at 60 frames per second, used 1.8 GB of texture data per frame, and pushed ten million polygons per frame, with {{approximately}} 300,000 to 400,000 polygons for each character model. The entire {{city in the}} demo was tessellated. There is <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> 100,000 illuminated firefly-like insects appear on screen, each one a full polygon mesh model with body and wings, which proceed to merge to generate a summoned monster. Production for the demo began in June 2011, and was initially produced as pre-rendered CGI animation by Visual Works before Square Enix attempted to reproduce it entirely in real-time with the Luminous Studio engine, using the same assets as the CGI version.|$|E

5|$|The Rio film unit {{captured}} aerial {{shots of}} the city including Sugarloaf Mountain, Fort Copacabana, Ipanema Beach, the Dona Marta lookout point and the Christ the Redeemer statue. Establishing {{shots of the}} heist team members were taken as each arrived in Rio. Gibson was filmed arriving in character at Galeão International Airport but, when it became publicly known that a scene was being shot at the airport, {{the cast and crew}} were mobbed. A similar situation occurred while Ludacris was shooting a scene in which his character buys a car to drive around the city. <b>A</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> the completed heist team walk down a beach was filmed in Copacabana.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Faran Tahir {{appears as}} Raza, {{the leader of}} the Ten Rings; Paul Bettany voices J.A.R.V.I.S., Stark's {{personal}} AI system; Leslie Bibb portrays Christine Everhart, a reporter for Vanity Fair; and Clark Gregg appears as Phil Coulson, an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.. Will Lyman provides the voiceover during the opening award ceremony. Director Jon Favreau plays Happy Hogan, Stark's bodyguard and chauffeur, and Samuel L. Jackson makes a cameo appearance as Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., in a post-credits scene. Jackson's face was previously used as the model for the Ultimate Marvel imprint version of Nick Fury. Other cameos in the film include Stan Lee as himself, being mistaken for Hugh Hefner by Stark at a party; Tom Morello, who provided guitar music for the film, as a terrorist guard; and Jim Cramer as himself. Ghostface Killah had a cameo in <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> Stark briefly stays in Dubai, but the scene was cut from the theatrical release for pacing reasons.|$|E
5|$|Captivated by Hedren's Nordic looks, Hitchcock becomes {{infatuated}} with her. While filming The Birds, he makes physical advances {{to her in}} the back of a limousine but she rebuffs him and escapes through the back door. In retaliation for her rejection, Hitchcock exposes Hedren to terrifying encounters with birds. A mechanical bird breaks the apparently shatterproof glass of a telephone booth during filming, scratching Hedren's face with splintering glass. After arriving on set to shoot <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> Hedren's character (Melanie Daniels) is trapped in an attic with aggressive birds, she discovers that Hitchcock has ordered the mechanical birds to be replaced with live ones. He demands the scene be repeated until he is satisfied that Hedren's reaction looks authentic. This takes a protracted several days of filming, leaving Hedren traumatised.|$|E
