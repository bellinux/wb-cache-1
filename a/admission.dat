40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{progress}} of hospital <b>admissions</b> over the time period 1995 - 2005 for the largest Greek general public hospital. Daily <b>admissions</b> data, disaggregated into elective and emergency were collected from the IT Department of the hospital. Great seasonality for hospital <b>admissions</b> was found. They reduce during weekends, the summer months and official holidays.   Emergency <b>admissions</b> are at their peak {{in the beginning of}} the week and decline afterwards. During weekends, emergency <b>admissions</b> decrease by 25 %. The majority of hospital elective <b>admissions</b> enter into the hospital from Monday to Thursday. During Friday and weekends, elective hospital <b>admissions</b> fall sharply, by 63 %. However, on Sunday, they slightly increase. The mean number of total hospital <b>admissions</b> increased by 17 % from 1995 to 2005. This increase in total <b>admissions</b> results from the significant increase of elective <b>admissions</b> (by 56 %) and not from the emergency <b>admissions</b> that fell by 17 %. </p...|$|R

5|$|UPLB admits {{more than}} 2,500 {{students}} and produces about 1,800 graduates every year. Undergraduate <b>admission</b> {{is determined by}} the University of the Philippines College <b>Admission</b> Test (UPCAT). Examinees that select UPLB as their preferred campus and garner a University Predicted Grade (UPG) within the standard cut-off are automatically eligible for <b>admission.</b> Those who do not automatically qualify may file an appeal for reconsideration if their UPG is within the actual cut-off, though the appeal process does not guarantee <b>admission.</b> The cut-off scores may be adjusted according to a variety of factors. In 2010, UPLB had a standard UPG cut-off of 2.42 while the actual cut-off was 2.8 (this actual cut-off was retained in 2011). But in 2014-2015 UPCAT, according to the Office of the University Registrar, UPLB had a standard cut off score of 2.3. Seventy percent of slots are given to incoming freshmen with the highest scores, while the remaining thirty percent are given to public high school students and members of minority groups. Before the UPCAT was used for <b>admission,</b> UPCA only admitted the top 5 percent of Philippine high school graduates.|$|E

5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from an artery.

METHODS:   Acute <b>admissions</b> with MS {{were obtained from the}} Scottish Morbidity Register between 1997 and 2009. We compared the pattern of these to <b>admissions</b> with other diagnoses. RESULTS:   We obtained data on 7098 MS and 6   243   690 non-MS acute and day-case <b>admissions.</b> We found a significant difference in acute MS <b>admissions</b> compared with <b>admissions</b> with other diagnoses (P =  0. 0015).
