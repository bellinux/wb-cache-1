5|$|Bryant and Milam were {{questioned}} by Leflore County sheriff George Smith. They <b>admitted</b> <b>they</b> {{had taken the}} boy from his great-uncle's yard but claimed they had released him the same night in front of Bryant's store. Bryant and Milam were arrested for kidnapping. Word got out that Till was missing, and soon Medgar Evers, Mississippi state field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Amzie Moore, head of the Bolivar County chapter, became involved. They disguised themselves as cotton pickers {{and went into the}} cotton fields in search of any information that might help find Till.|$|E
5|$|In the Second Round Vale drew another league {{rival in}} Southport, who battled to a 1–1 draw at Haig Avenue on 12 December, Harry Whitworth's header {{cancelling}} out Basil Hayward's opener. The Vale players later <b>admitted</b> <b>they</b> were fortunate to {{come away with}} a draw, especially seen as Colin Askey and Albert Leake {{spent much of the}} game limping. Two days later Vale recorded a 2–0 win in the replay in what was a tough game.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Day {{returned}} to moulding Sabrina to meet his requirements for the ideal woman, choosing what she would wear, and pushing his ideas of frugality upon her. Sabrina took on all the ideas willingly and Day believed he had finally created a woman who would meet all his requirements. He was so confident that he talked openly of marrying Sabrina, though she was unaware of his intentions. Eventually one of Day's friends {{let her know that}} he hoped to marry her. Sabrina confronted Day about the rumours and he <b>admitted</b> <b>they</b> were true, neglecting to mention that he had hoped to marry her since the day he met her.|$|E

25|$|One affair {{resulted}} in {{the birth of a}} son. In October 1987, while on tour in the US, Jones had a brief relationship with model Katherine Berkery, who then discovered she was pregnant. After a legal battle that included DNA testing, a United States court ruled in 1989 that Jones was the boy's father. Jones denied the court's findings, until finally, in 2008, he <b>admitted</b> <b>they</b> were true. He has shown no interest in meeting his son, Jonathan Berkery.|$|E
25|$|Although HRT <b>admitted</b> <b>they</b> {{crossed the}} line two weeks ago when they {{reported}} {{the results of the}} exit polls conducted by RTL and Nova TV, they once again 'borrowed' the results for the second round election night.

Finally, exactly nine days after the election, on 19 January, she was released of her duties as chief editor.|$|E

25|$|Despite Alpha's victory, Sir Alan was {{not happy}} with either team's performance, and in {{particular}} had heavy criticism for Helene's leadership, even questioning whether she had deliberately tried to make her team lose {{to get rid of}} Lucinda, something that Helene insisted was untrue. Lucinda repeatedly told Helene she was not prepared and asked if someone could switch, but Helene refused and accused Lucinda of being lazy, resulting in Lucinda snapping at her. The panel on You're Fired pointed out that the members of Alpha <b>admitted</b> <b>they</b> had little confidence in Lucinda's abilities, effectively undermining her contribution; it was agreed that had they lost, Helene should have been fired.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of her murder, Christine and Fred Schultz had been {{divorced}} six months. Fred Schultz initially stated he was on duty investigating a burglary with his partner, Michael Durfee, at {{the time of}} the murder, but years later he <b>admitted</b> <b>they</b> were actually drinking at a local bar. When ballistics testing revealed it was his off-duty revolver that had been the murder weapon, suspicion shifted to Laurie Bembenek, as she had been alone in the apartment she shared with Schultz and had access to both the gun and a key to Christine's house that Fred Schultz had secretly copied from his oldest son's house key. Bembenek was arrested for Christine Schultz's murder on June 24, 1981.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{police and}} other {{security}} forces in Iraq began making similar displays of suspected insurgents and other criminals. Two defendants {{were taken to}} crime scenes to recount their role in a massacre to assembled media, while alleged members of a gang of robbers were posed behind tables stacked with the goods they had supposedly stolen. In one instance that officials later <b>admitted</b> <b>they</b> lost control of, suspected terrorists were led into an auditorium where the acting Minister of the Interior attempted to detail their crimes before not only the media but an audience {{of the family members}} of the victims. He was unable to finish as members of the latter group interrupted him with calls for the defendants' execution and shoeing attempts.|$|E

25|$|Police <b>admitted</b> <b>they</b> {{had little}} {{physical}} evidence linking Yoo to the murders.

When he was forced to return two weeks later, he lunged at the three presiding judges and recanted his confession for the February 2004 Imun-dong murder. He refused to appear at the next court session on , after attempting suicide the night before. Yoo again disrupted a hearing three weeks later when he tried to attack a spectator who had cursed him, which ended with Yoo signing a statement that he would not cause further commotion.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years later}} Turner's team {{eliminated}} Blackburn Rovers, {{who at the}} time lay second in the First Division, in the fifth round of the FA Cup. They thus became the first Fourth Division side to reach the sixth round. In 1964–65, he led them to promotion from the Fourth Division, and three years later to the championship of the Third. By this time the young players who had been the mainstay of Oxford's rise through the divisions were ageing or retired. Turner had no money to strengthen the side for its Second Division campaign, and struggled with what he had. In April 1969, he became General Manager of the club, leaving the running of the team to Ron Saunders, and in February 1972 he was dismissed when the club <b>admitted</b> <b>they</b> were unable to afford to keep him in post.|$|E
25|$|Thomas {{produced}} {{a trio of}} albums for power pop group Badfinger on {{the tail end of}} their career, beginning with 1973's Ass, and 1974's Badfinger and Wish You Were Here albums. Ass was originally recorded with Badfinger producing, but the group later <b>admitted</b> <b>they</b> were incapable of producing themselves. Members Pete Ham and Tom Evans solicited Thomas' help in cleaning up existing recordings and laying down new tracks. Although the succeeding album Badfinger retained Thomas from the outset and was considered by critics to be an improvement in production, neither album was successful in the marketplace. For their third project together, Thomas held a meeting with the group and pleaded that they all concentrate on making the best record they could muster. It turned out that Wish You Were Here garnered the most positive critical response from periodicals, including Rolling Stone magazine.|$|E

25|$|However {{the city}} did not {{generally}} experience paramilitary violence directly, {{with the exception}} a period {{in the early to}} mid 1970s when it was the target of several loyalist bombings. The 1972 and 1973 Dublin bombings killed 3 people and injured 185. The worst bomb attacks, however, occurred on Talbot street in 1974. The Dublin and Monaghan Bombings on 17 May 1974 were a series of terrorist attacks on Dublin and Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland which left 33 people dead (26 of them in Dublin), and almost 300 injured, the largest number of casualties in any single day in the Troubles. Although no organisation claimed responsibility for the attacks at the time, loyalist paramilitaries from Northern Ireland (in particular the Ulster Volunteer Force) were widely blamed. In 1993 the Ulster Volunteer Force <b>admitted</b> <b>they</b> carried out the attacks. It has been widely speculated that the bombers were aided by members of the British security forces.|$|E
25|$|Noor's {{head and}} penis were never recovered, {{although}} Linda later <b>admitted</b> <b>they</b> {{had put the}} head in rubbish bins around Phoenix Park. It was also thought that they carried the head by bus to Tallaght and buried it in a field, with Linda returning later to dig it up, carry it to another field using her son's schoolbag, smash it further with a hammer and bury it again. Linda attracted further media attention when she slit her wrists and was sectioned. Charlotte also attracted media attention when a photograph of her holding a knife to a male prisoner's throat was published; that action resulted in an increased security presence in all Irish prisons and Charlotte was moved from Mountjoy to Limerick. Kathleen Mulhall voluntarily returned to Ireland in February 2008 and faced several charges. She pleaded guilty to helping clean up the crime scene to conceal evidence {{and was sentenced to}} five years in prison in May 2009.|$|E
25|$|On 7 July, Lyon {{confirmed}} {{their first}} transfer arrival to the club. After {{almost two weeks}} of negotiations with Portuguese club Porto, Lyon reached an agreement on a transfer fee for the Argentine striker Lisandro López. The transfer fee was priced at €24million, with the fee rising {{to as much as}} €28million with incentives, thereby making López the club's most expensive signing. The following week, Lyon addressed an important need after reaching an agreement with Lille for the transfer of the Brazilian left winger Michel Bastos, with the transfer fee being approximately €18million. Two days later, Lyon filled another need, signing another Porto player in left back Aly Cissokho for €15 million. An additional incentive involved in the deal is Porto will receive 20 percent of any future transfer fee Lyon receives for the player. On 29 July, Lyon, who <b>admitted</b> <b>they</b> needed at least one more striker, announced the signing of French international Bafétimbi Gomis from rivals Saint-Étienne, with the fee being approximately €13 million.|$|E
