5|$|Most of {{the islanders}} were {{fishermen}} and crofters; some also worked as maritime pilots to guide vessels through the treacherous {{waters of the}} Pentland Firth.

At least twenty four vessels are known to have been wrecked in the area. the most serious being the Dove in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives. Another notable wreck was the Florence Irving in 1877.|$|E

5|$|Investigation of shipwrecks in {{vicinity}} of Pedra Branca. Singapore had duties to investigate hazards to navigational safety and to publish information about such hazards in its capacity as <b>a</b> <b>lighthouse</b> operator, {{and under the}} United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea. Therefore, by investigating and reporting on shipwrecks and maritime hazards within Pedra Branca's territorial waters Singapore had acted in accordance with best practice and not à titre de souverain. The circumstances of the particular investigations also meant that Singapore's ability to carry them out was not based on its sovereignty over the island.|$|E

Jacqueline Bisset developed laryngitis during the film's production.
