5|$|On {{the sets}} {{of the film}} Arya, Raju offered Bhaskar a film to direct. On the sets of Bhadra, Bhaskar narrated the story to Raju and the saga began. Thus, Bommarillu became the first directorial venture for Bhaskar. In an interview, {{he said that the}} story for the film began taking shape in as early as 1997 when he wrote about <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> son's relationship. However, when the plans of making the film arose, an element of love between the protagonists was added. In the interview, he said that the script, to an extent, is autobiographical. He cites {{personal}} examples of some scenes from the film such as the choice of clothes for Siddhu by Aravind, the head-bump between the lead actors and Lakshmi singing in the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|In the manga Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Beveridge liked Sasuke's personality, {{particularly}} {{as it was}} presented during his dialogue with Naruto. Reviewing the anime adaptation, Sam Stewart from IGN was particularly impressed by the scenes between Sasuke and Sarada, most notably because of changes in Sasuke's characterization. He highlights that despite acting coldly towards his daughter, he ends up using his body as a shield {{to protect her from}} his enemy. Ken Iikura from Anime Now agreed, pointing out that Sasuke has become a loving husband and father in Boruto, despite retaining some of the dark aspects of his personality. Ikikura noted that Sasuke and Sarada's meeting in Boruto significantly developed both characters. McNulty disliked the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series, because she felt it was initially an one-sided crush on Sakura's part, but she believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden expanded on the bond between the two and their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Stewart praised Sasuke's portrayal as a flawed parent rather than an effortlessly good one, noting that his farewell to Sarada demonstrated his difficulty with being a good father. Another writer from Anime Now, Sarah Nelkin, noted that these episodes helped to develop Sasuke as both <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> husband, especially when he explains to Sarada that she creates a bond between him and Sakura that persists despite his being frequently absent {{as a result of his}} mission.|$|E
25|$|LGBT {{movements}} are opposed {{by a variety}} of individuals and organizations. Some social conservatives believe that all sexual relationships with people other than an opposite-sex spouse undermine the traditional family and that children should be reared in homes with both <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> mother. Some opponents of gay rights say that such rights may conflict with individuals' freedom of speech, religious freedoms in the workplace, the ability to run churches, charitable organizations and other religious organizations in accordance with one's religious views, and that the acceptance of homosexual relationships by religious organizations might be forced through threatening to remove the tax-exempt status of churches whose views do not align with those of the government. Some critics charge that political correctness has led to the association of sex between males and HIV being downplayed.|$|E

25|$|Throughout Genie's {{stay the}} {{scientists}} saw how frequently and effectively {{she used her}} nonverbal skills, and never determined what she did to elicit such strong reactions from other people. David Rigler vividly remembered an occasion when he and Genie passed <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> young boy carrying a toy firetruck without speaking to each other, and said the boy suddenly turned around and gave the firetruck to Genie. Curtiss also recalled one time when, while she and Genie were walking and had stopped at a busy intersection, she unexpectedly heard a purse emptying; she turned to see a woman stop at the intersection and exit her car to give Genie a plastic purse, even though Genie had not said anything. To {{take full advantage of}} her nonverbal communication abilities, in 1974 the Riglers arranged for her to learn a form of sign language.|$|E
25|$|On 22 March 2001, {{tensions}} soared {{further in}} Tetovo, when two Albanian men, <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> son, were shot dead during a routine search at a police checkpoint. The incident {{began when the}} car was stopped and a police officer saw the younger Albanian move something in his pocket. Fearing it was a grenade the officer panicked and ran. The Albanian exited the car, dropped to his knees, and threw the grenade {{in the direction of}} the running policeman. It landed at his feet but failed to explode. At the moment the grenade was thrown, a cordon of Macedonian troops, positioned behind sandbags, unleashed a volley of gunfire at the Albanian. At first he slumped against the car, then fell on the curb, dead. Moments later the father was also shot as he tried to run from the car. Witnesses later interviewed insisted the father and son died with mobile phones in their hands, claiming that the pair were victims of revenge by police.|$|E
25|$|Several JNA {{officers}} and regular soldiers intervened {{on a number}} of occasions to prevent further killings and saved a number of civilians. The security service of the 180th Motorised Brigade received reports of the killings and Major Branislav Ristić interviewed two members of the brigade's military police (MP) about these murders. The MPs described summary executions, brief interrogations of civilians and their killing. They described how they saw TO troops drag <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> daughter out of a house, shoot the man in the mouth in front of the girl and threaten to kill her as well. Finally, the MPs stepped out of their vehicle and took the girl away, threatening to shoot the soldiers if they did not desist. They reported one instance of a TO soldier hitting an elderly man on the head with a rifle butt, shooting him in the legs and then shooting him in the head. The two also recalled an incident where a child was forced into a house that was then targeted by several RPGs and set alight. Ristić also received reports that at least one elderly man from Škabrnja was executed using an RPG and that a member of the TO was seen showing off a bag of ears purportedly belonging to dead villagers.|$|E

25|$|Pownoll's {{death was}} widely mourned, Pellew writing {{in his report}} to the Admiralty that: 'The loss of Captain Pownoll will be {{severely}} felt. The ship's company have lost a father. I have lost much more, <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> friend united; and that friend my only one on earth. Never, my lord, was grief more poignant than that we all feel for an adored commander. Mine is inexpressible.' Admiral John Jervis wrote of {{him that he was}} ‘the best officer, & most excellent, kind hearted man in the Profession’, and claimed that he had ‘lost the best Partizan, if not the best officer under every line of description in the Service’. Edward Osler wrote in 1835 that 'St Vincent and Pownoll who were brought up under Boscawen, and received their Lieutenant's commission from him, contributed materially to form a Nelson or an Exmouth; each the founder of a school of officers, whose model is the character of their chief, and their example his successes.' As well as Pellew, John Borlase Warren served under Pownoll and {{went on to become a}} leading frigate captain, while Jervis remembered Pownoll's contribution to the navy in 1804, when he promoted Pownoll's grandson, John Bastard. Pellew named his eldest son Pownoll Bastard Pellew in honour of his former captain and his family.|$|E

500|$|Jonathan Cott {{noted that}} Mulberry Street {{is similar to}} [...] "Der Erlkönig", a German poem by Goethe, [...] "for {{both of them are}} about <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> son and about the exigencies and power of the imagination." [...] When Cott told Geisel about this, Geisel responded by quoting the first two lines of the poem, in German. He also noted that he was raised in a German-speaking home, minored in German in college, and had memorized the poem while in high school.|$|E

500|$|Michael Caine as John Cutter, {{the stage}} {{engineer}} (ingenieur) {{who works with}} Angier and Borden. Caine had previously collaborated with Nolan and Bale in Batman Begins. Nolan said that even though {{it felt like the}} character of Cutter was written for Caine, it was not. Nolan noted that the character was written [...] "before I'd ever met" [...] Caine. Caine describes Cutter as [...] "a teacher, <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> guide to Angier". Caine, in trying to create Cutter's nuanced portrait, altered his voice and posture. Nolan later said that [...] "Michael Caine’s character really becomes something of the heart of the film. He has a wonderful warmth and emotion to him that draws you into the story and allows you to have a point of view on these characters without judging them too harshly." ...|$|E
500|$|In Chinese literature, {{ailanthus}} {{is often}} used for two rather extreme metaphors, with a mature tree representing <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> stump being a spoiled child. This manifests itself occasionally when expressing best wishes to a friend's father and mother in a letter, where one can write [...] "wishing your ailanthus and daylily are strong and happy", with ailanthus metaphorically referring to the father and daylily to the mother. Furthermore, one can scold a child by calling him a [...] "good-for-nothing ailanthus stump sprout", meaning the child is irresponsible. This derives from the literature of Zhuangzi, a Taoist philosopher, who referred to a tree that had developed from a sprout at the stump and was thus unsuitable for carpentry due to its irregular shape. Later scholars associated this tree with ailanthus and applied the metaphor to children who, like stump sprouts of the tree, will not develop into a worthwhile human being if they don't follow rules or traditions.|$|E
500|$|Critically, {{the book}} was well-received, albeit controversial. Erika Milvy from Salon praised it as [...] "beautifully written, startling and heart wrenching". Tony Sims from Wired Magazine wrote that the book [...] "reveals the beauty and agony of a tormented nation as it {{tells the story of}} an {{improbable}} friendship between two boys from opposite ends of society, and of the troubled but enduring relationship between <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> son". Amelia Hill of The Guardian opinionated, [...] "The Kite Runner is the shattering first novel by Khaled Hosseini" [...] that [...] "is simultaneously devastating and inspiring." [...] A similarly favorable review was printed in Publishers Weekly. Marketing director Melissa Mytinger remarked, [...] "It's simply an excellent story. Much of it based in a world we don't know, a world we're barely beginning to know. Well-written, published at the 'right time' by an author who is both charming and thoughtful in his personal appearances for the book." [...] Indian-American actor Aasif Mandvi agreed that {{the book was}} [...] "amazing storytelling.... It's about human beings. It's about redemption, and redemption is a powerful theme." [...] First Lady Laura Bush commended the story as [...] "really great". Said Tayeb Jawad, the 19th Afghan ambassador to the United States, publicly endorsed The Kite Runner, saying that the book would help the American public to better understand Afghan society and culture.|$|E

500|$|Amid the {{confiscation}} of the Dudley family's possessions in July 1553, Mary {{had allowed}} Jane Dudley to retain her wardrobe and plate, carpets, and other household stuffs, {{as well as}} the use of the Duke's house in Chelsea, London. There, she died on either 15 or 22 January 1555, and was buried on 1 February at Chelsea Old Church. In her will she tried to provide for her sons financially and thanked the Queen, {{as well as the}} many Spanish nobles she had lobbied. The Duchess of Alba was to receive her green parrot; to Don Diego de Acevedo she gave [...] "the new bed of green velvet with all the furniture to it; beseeching him even as he hath in my lifetime showed himself like <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> brother to my sons, so shall [...] require him no less to do now their mother is gone". She also remembered [...] "my lord, my dear husband", and stipulated: [...] "in no wise let me be opened after I am dead. ... I have not lived to be very bold before women, much more I should be loth to come into the hands of any living man, be he Physician or Surgeon."

500|$|Frustrated by {{the limited}} career options open to respectable yet poor women—an {{impediment}} which Wollstonecraft eloquently describes {{in the chapter}} of Thoughts on the Education of Daughters entitled [...] "Unfortunate Situation of Females, Fashionably Educated, and Left Without a Fortune"—she decided, after only {{a year as a}} governess, to embark upon a career as an author. This was a radical choice, since, at the time, few women could support themselves by writing. As she wrote to her sister Everina in 1787, she was trying to become [...] "the first of a new genus". She moved to London and, assisted by the liberal publisher Joseph Johnson, found a place to live and work to support herself. She learned French and German and translated texts, most notably Of the Importance of Religious Opinions by Jacques Necker and Elements of Morality, for the Use of Children by Christian Gotthilf Salzmann. She also wrote reviews, primarily of novels, for Johnson's periodical, the Analytical Review. Wollstonecraft's intellectual universe expanded during this time, not only from the reading that she did for her reviews but also from the company she kept: she attended Johnson's famous dinners and met such luminaries as the radical pamphleteer Thomas Paine and the philosopher William Godwin. The first time Godwin and Wollstonecraft met, they were both disappointed in each other. Godwin had come to hear Paine, but Wollstonecraft assailed him all night long, disagreeing with him on nearly every subject. Johnson himself, however, became much more than a friend; she described him in her letters as <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> brother.|$|E

[...] Bruner claimed that children receiving this [...] "indoctrination" [...] will [...] "become confused about their sexuality" [...] and are [...] "told their parents are bigoted because they do not accept Islam and gay marriage." ...|$|E

2500|$|Florida State {{recently}} developed a rivalry with their Atlantic Division foe Clemson. Florida State leads the all-time series 20–10.

In addition to their in-state rivals, Florida State enjoys baseball rivalries, primarily with Georgia Tech.|$|E
2500|$|LGBT {{movements}} are opposed {{by a variety}} of individuals and organizations. They may have a personal, moral, political or religious objection to gay rights, homosexual relations or gay people. [...] Opponents say same-sex relationships are not marriages, that legalization of same-sex marriage will open the door for the legalization of polygamy, [...] that it is unnatural and that it encourages unhealthy behavior. Some social conservatives believe that all sexual relationships with people other than an opposite-sex spouse undermines the traditional family and that children should be reared in homes with both <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> mother. As society has become more accepting of homosexuality, there therefore has also been the emergence of many groups that desire to end homosexuality; during the 1990s, one of the best known groups that was established with this goal is the ex-gay movement.|$|E
