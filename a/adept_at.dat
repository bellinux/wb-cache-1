5|$|While {{with the}} White Sox, Uribe was always {{regarded}} as a talented player. He was especially <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> fielding and hitting home runs. However, Ozzie Guillén had issues with Uribe's low on-base percentage and his conditioning.|$|E
5|$|Wilson is {{primarily}} a right-back, but is also <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> playing on the right-side of midfield, and can also fill in at left-back, central midfield or the left-hand side of midfield if needed.|$|E
5|$|Davis hired Indiana University {{economics}} Ph.D. {{graduate student}} Jimmy Wales {{to analyze the}} company's pricing-model strategy; Wales left his graduate program to join the company as research director, serving in that capacity from 1994 through 1998. He was <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> determining future movements of foreign currencies and interest rates, and Davis mentored Wales in more-aggressive financial trading.|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Glinda, [...] "is the {{transformation}} of Queen Coo-ce-oh, the haughty and wicked witch who betrayed the three <b>Adepts</b> <b>at</b> Magic and treated her people like slaves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] replied Ervic, after {{a period}} of thought, [...] "that might be. If you {{transformed}} my three fish into three girls--girls who would be <b>Adepts</b> <b>at</b> Magic, you know they might please me as well as the fish do. You won't do that of course, because you can't, with all your skill. And, should you be able to do so, I fear my troubles would be more than I could bear. They would not consent to be my slaves--especially if they were <b>Adepts</b> <b>at</b> Magic--and so they would command me to obey them. No, Mistress Reera, let us not transform the fishes at all." ...|$|R
60|$|The Skeezer had put {{his case}} with {{remarkable}} cleverness. He realized that if he appeared anxious for such a transformation the Yookoohoo would not perform it, yet he had skillfully suggested that they be made <b>Adepts</b> <b>at</b> Magic.|$|R
5|$|Defensively he {{made use}} of poke checks to take the puck from his opponents and excelled at getting to loose pucks and {{clearing}} {{them out of the}} defensive zone. He was <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> keeping opposing forwards from creating offence from behind the net.|$|E
5|$|During the War of the First Coalition, he {{was active}} {{at the battle}} of Neerwinden and the {{campaign}} on the Piave River in northern Italy. During these campaigns, he proved equally <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> leading heavy or light cavalry, although some military analysts consider he was a better heavy cavalry leader. In 1793, he was promoted to general of brigade.|$|E
5|$|Metagenomics {{can provide}} {{valuable}} {{insights into the}} functional ecology of environmental communities. Metagenomic analysis of the bacterial consortia found in the defecations of Australian sea lions suggests that nutrient-rich sea lion faeces {{may be an important}} nutrient source for coastal ecosystems. This is because the bacteria that are expelled simultaneously with the defecations are <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> breaking down the nutrients in the faeces into a bioavailable form that can be taken up into the food chain.|$|E
60|$|The three <b>Adepts</b> <b>at</b> Magic, who had {{formerly}} {{ruled the}} Flatheads wisely and considerately, went with Princess Ozma and her people, for they had promised Ozma {{to stay on}} the mountain and again see that the laws were enforced.|$|R
60|$|The Skeezers quickly {{recognized}} the three <b>Adepts</b> <b>at</b> Magic, {{whom they had}} learned to respect before their wicked Queen betrayed them, and welcomed them as friends. All {{the inhabitants of the}} village had been greatly frightened by their imprisonment under water, but now realized that an attempt was to be made to rescue them.|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems," [...] {{continued}} Glinda musingly, [...] "that Coo-ee-oh derived {{most of her}} witchcraft {{from three}} <b>Adepts</b> <b>at</b> Magic, who at one time ruled the Flatheads. While the Adepts were being entertained by Coo-ee-oh at a banquet in her palace, she cruelly betrayed them and after transforming them into fishes cast them into the lake.|$|R
5|$|Shakespeare's {{use of his}} poetic {{dramatic}} structure (especially effects such as switching between {{comedy and}} tragedy to heighten tension, his expansion of minor characters, and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story) has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill. The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters, sometimes changing the form as the character develops. Romeo, for example, grows more <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> the sonnet {{over the course of}} the play.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{does not}} itself have many predators and large {{individuals}} are <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> jumping and swimming to escape attackers. Any attached juveniles benefit from this. However, the scallops are intolerant of low salinity levels, and mortality sometimes occurs {{as a result}} of a pool of relatively fresh water that sometimes forms during the summer months under the sea ice as it melts.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} de Castries {{as the local}} {{commander}} at Điện Biên Phủ was, in retrospect, a bad one. Navarre had picked de Castries, a cavalryman in the 18th-century tradition, because Navarre envisioned Điện Biên Phủ as a mobile battle. Điện Biên Phủ required someone <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> World War I-style trench warfare, something for which de Castries was not suited.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] said the Wizard {{after a brief}} silence had {{followed}} Glinda's speech, [...] "that there are three fishes in this lake {{that used to be}} <b>Adepts</b> <b>at</b> Magic and from whom Coo-ee-oh stole much of her knowledge. If we could find those fishes and return them to their former shapes, they could doubtless tell us what to do to bring the sunken island to the surface." ...|$|R
60|$|The three Adepts {{could not}} avoid {{laughing}} merrily, {{for not only}} were they amused by the queer form of the Patchwork Girl, but Trot's enthusiastic speech struck them as really funny. If the Great Sorceress and the famous Wizard and the three talented <b>Adepts</b> <b>at</b> Magic were unable as yet to solve the important problem of the sunken isle, there was little chance for a patched girl stuffed with cotton to succeed.|$|R
60|$|A loud shout of {{approval}} {{burst from the}} Danes. Although the conqueror was their enemy they appreciated so highly the virtues of coolness and courage that their applause was no less hearty than if the victor had been a countryman. Sweyn had fallen almost the instant the blow had been struck. The ring was at once broken up, and his friends ran to him. The Norsemen were <b>adepts</b> <b>at</b> the treatment of wounds, and everything had been prepared in case of emergencies.|$|R
5|$|The large {{populations of}} {{tortoises}} and marine turtles on Rodrigues {{resulted in the}} export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. At least five species of Aplonis starlings have become extinct in islands of the Pacific Ocean, and rats also contributed to their demise.|$|E
5|$|Wellesley's {{understanding}} of logistics was to prove valuable in leading an expeditionary force against the French invasion of Portugal and Spain. He was <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> planning long marches through unknown territory, understanding {{that he not}} only had thousands of men to manage efficiently, but that {{a huge amount of}} supplies were required to adequately feed and sustain his army. Secure supply lines to the Portuguese coast were of vital importance if he was to maintain his ability to fight the French.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are very}} common around picnic areas in Tasmania's {{two most popular}} National Parks, Freycinet and Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair, and are often fed by {{tourists}} there. The National Parks Authority tolerated this practice until 1995, when they found the birds were becoming a nuisance and began discouraging people from feeding wildlife. However, the agile currawongs are <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so the birds may only ultimately be discouraged by an (impractical) ban on food in National Parks. Birds also take other items such as soap or cutlery from campsites to examine.|$|E
60|$|The instant {{this sound}} reached {{the ears of}} the cattle they became {{absolutely}} silent, neither bellowing nor feeding! It was evident that they were listening with the utmost attention. Understanding this, the hunters stood quite still, without a whisper, {{but a few of}} those who were <b>adepts</b> <b>at</b> the art continued their imitation of cropping the grass. After listening for a time the animals appeared to arrive at the conclusion that it was a false alarm, for they re-commenced feeding, and the hunters continued their stealthy approach.|$|R
2500|$|Like the Kadampa, the Gelugpa eschewed the tulku system. After Gendun Drup died, however, a boy called Sangyey Pel born to Nyngma <b>adepts</b> <b>at</b> Yolkar in Tsang, {{declared}} himself at 3 to be [...] "Gendun Drup" [...] {{and asked to}} be 'taken home' to Tashilhunpo. He spoke in mystical verses, quoted classical texts {{out of the blue}} and said he was Dromtönpa, an earlier incarnation of the Dalai Lamas. When he saw monks from Tashilhunpo he greeted the disciples of the late Gendun Drup by name. The Gelugpa elders had to break with tradition and recognised him as Gendun Drup's tulku.|$|R
50|$|Ozma {{frequently}} encounters difficulties while ruling her kingdom. In The Lost Princess of Oz, for instance, the Fairy Princess is kidnapped, {{although her}} dearest friend Dorothy Gale {{comes to her}} rescue with a search party. Both Dorothy and Ozma are captured by the wicked Queen Coo-ee-oh in Glinda of Oz, while trying to stop a war between two races, but Glinda the Good Witch manages to save them {{with the help of}} the Three <b>Adepts</b> <b>at</b> Sorcery. In order to circumvent trouble, Ozma prohibits anyone other than the Wizard of Oz and Glinda from practicing magic in Oz unless they have a permit.|$|R
5|$|Born in Forbes, New South Wales, on 27February 1903, Lester Brain was {{the second}} son of an English mining {{engineer}} and manager, Austin Brain, and his Australian wife, Katie. Originally from Gloucestershire, Austin had emigrated with his parents and siblings in 1885, prospecting for gold in the United States before settling in Australia. By the age of thirteen, Lester owned his own motorcycle bought secondhand for £11; its poor condition and constant need for repair helped him become mechanically <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> an early age. He completed his education at Sydney Grammar School, where he excelled in maths, before being employed by the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney (CBC) in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Born in Preston in 1850, {{descended from}} an old Preston family that {{included}} a Preston Guild Mayor, Sudell joined the Preston Nelson sports club in August 1867, aged 17. During this period the club were recruiting many young sportsmen from the area to play new sports, in order to relieve financial pressures. Sudell proved <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> several sports including swimming, cycling, cricket and rugby. The club played its first game of association football in 1878, against Eagley, with Sudell {{a member of the}} team. However, Sudell did not go on to play on a regular basis; only two other football matches featuring him as a player are known.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev was <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> the {{politics}} within the Soviet power structure. He {{was a team}} player and never acted rashly or hastily; unlike Khrushchev, he did not make decisions without substantial consultation from his colleagues, and was always willing to hear their opinions. During the early 1970s, Brezhnev consolidated his domestic position. In 1977, he forced the retirement of Podgorny and became once again Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, making this position equivalent to that of an executive president. While Kosygin remained Premier until {{shortly before his death}} in 1980 (replaced by Nikolai Tikhonov as Premier), Brezhnev was the dominant driving force of the Soviet Union from the mid-1970s to his death in 1982.|$|E
5000|$|Like the Kadampa, the Gelugpa eschewed the tulku system. After Gendun Drup died, however, a boy called Sangyey Pel born to Nyngma <b>adepts</b> <b>at</b> Yolkar in Tsang, {{declared}} himself at 3 to be [...] "Gendun Drup" [...] {{and asked to}} be 'taken home' to Tashilhunpo.

60|$|The {{preceding}} notes {{show that}} the natives of the Gold Coast, and of West Africa generally, are <b>adepts</b> <b>at</b> procuring their gold by 'surfacing,' washing with the calabash or wooden bowl the rich alluvial formations that underlie the top-soil. This is the rudest form of machinery, preceding in California the cradle, the torn, and the sluice. Westerns made their pans of brass or copper, about sixteen inches in diameter, and nearly two inches deep in the middle where the gold gravitates. Panning in Africa is women's work, and {{the process has been}} described in the preceding pages.|$|R
50|$|A fellow officer {{observed}} that Rochefort had {{a penchant for}} solving crossword puzzles and <b>adept</b> skills <b>at</b> playing the advanced card game auction bridge and recommended him for a Navy cryptanalysis class in Washington, D.C.|$|R
5|$|During {{the course}} of the evaluation, the Tri-partite pilots {{developed}} a typical sortie routine for the Kestrel of conducting short take-offs (STO) and returning to base on vertical landings. This manner of operation (STOVL) was judged to be the optimal practice. Operating from rough airstrips was also trialled at nearby RAF Bircham Newton, where the aircraft proved <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> traversing boggy ground and taking off from a variety of temporary ground coverings. During testing one aircraft was lost when a pilot tried to do a rolling take-off with the parking brake on; the evaluations were finalised in November 1965.|$|E
5|$|Hancock was {{commissioned}} a brevet second {{lieutenant in the}} 6th U.S. Infantry regiment, and initially was stationed in Indian Territory in the Red River Valley. The region was quiet at the time, and Hancock's time there was uneventful. Upon the outbreak of war with Mexico in 1846, Hancock worked to secure himself {{a place at the}} front. Initially assigned to recruiting duties in Kentucky, he proved so <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> signing up soldiers that his superiors were reluctant to release him from his post. By July 1847, however, Hancock was permitted to join his regiment in Puebla, Mexico, where they made up a part of the army led by his namesake, General Winfield Scott.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, {{at the age}} of 14, Stanley's father {{insisted that}} he leave school and help him in his trade. Stanley worked in his father's {{unsuccessful}} building business, becoming <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> working with metal and wood, later to obtain employment as a plumber/drainage contractor and joiner in London. He joined his father in 1849 at an engineering works at Whitechapel, working as a Pattern Maker's Improver where he invented the steel wheel spider-spokes. His father discouraged him from seeking a patent for this invention. For the following five years, he was in partnership with his maternal uncle (a Mr Warren), a builder, at Buntingford.|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{one of the}} {{favorite}} pursuits of sailors during a dogwatch below at sea is cards; and though {{they do not understand}} whist, cribbage, and games of that kidney, yet they are <b>adepts</b> <b>at</b> what is called [...] "High-low- Jack-and-the-game," [...] which name, indeed, has a Jackish and nautical flavor. Their stakes are generally so many plugs of tobacco, which, like rouleaux of guineas, are piled on their chests when they play. Judge, then, the wicked zest with which the Highlander's crew now shuffled and dealt the pack; and how the interest curiously and invertedly increased, as the stakes necessarily became less and less; and finally resolved themselves into [...] "chaws." ...|$|R

50|$|Graduates of {{the program}} pursue careers in every {{function}} and industry, private and not-for-profit, around the world.
