40|$|Fault {{propagation}} {{depends on}} the applied stress and on the mechanical characteristic of the host rocks. In an isotropic system, a fault develops with substantial constant rate and dip. Natural systems, differently, are far from being uniform and anisotropies affects the development of faults. Rocks variability, fluids, and pre-existing faults are examples of anisotropies that may <b>accelerate,</b> <b>stop</b> or decelerate the propagation of the faults from depth up to the surface. Active tectonic studies on extensional systems relay on mapping of their surface traces. In many active areas, however, the extension is a young process and the related faults may be still confined at depth or poorly expressed at the surface. A commonly used tool in earthquake geology is to infer the seismic potential of a fault from its surface displacement and from empirical relationships relating magnitude with fault length. This approach cannot be applied when active faults are blind. During the blind phase, the fault propagation is hard to be detected and also the role of pre-existing faults on the upward propagation of extensional faults cannot be observed. To understand these topics, we simulated a blind extensional fault interacting with differently oriented mechanical discontinuities in analogue models. This tool can effectively describe blind faults evolution, their surface effects, and their interactions with pre-existing discontinuities. We simulated seven different settings where pre-existing discontinuities are placed above the upper tip of a 45 ° dipping master fault. We quantified the strain distribution within the models and we reconstructed {{the evolution of the}} fault-related folds at significant steps. The results indicate that during the evolution of a growing extensional fault, pre-existing discontinuities affect the ability of new faults to reach the surface, the development of secondary brittle structures related to fault-propagation folding, and the shape of the related basins together with the migration through time of the folds axes. All these elements are differently affected depending on the geometrical relationships between the main fault and the inherited discontinuities. These results can provide clues for interpreting surface evidence while analyzing areas where active faults are blind or hidden...|$|E

40|$|We {{created the}} Flexible <b>Accelerated</b> <b>STOP</b> Tetracycline Operator (tetO) -knockin (FAST) system, an {{efficient}} method for manipulating gene expression in vivo to rapidly screen animal models of disease. A single gene targeting event yields two distinct knockin mice-STOP-tetO and tetO knockin-that permit generation of multiple strains with variable expression patterns: 1) knockout, 2) Cre-mediated rescue, 3) tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activator (tTA) -mediated misexpression, 4) tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activator (tTA) -mediated overexpression, and 5) tetracycline-controlled transcriptional silencer (tTS) -mediated conditional knockout/knockdown. Using the FAST system, multiple gain-of-function and loss-of-function strains {{can therefore be}} generated on a time scale not previously achievable. These strains can then be screened for clinically relevant abnormalities. We demonstrate the flexibility and broad applicability of the FAST system by targeting several genes encoding proteins implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders: Mlc 1, neuroligin 3, the serotonin 1 A receptor, and the serotonin 1 B receptor...|$|R

40|$|Deficits in {{inhibitory}} control, {{the ability}} to suppress ongoing or planned motor or cognitive processes, contribute to many psychiatric and neurological disorders. The rehabilitation of inhibition-related disorders may therefore benefit from neuroplasticity-based training protocols aiming at normalizing inhibitory control proficiency and the underlying brain networks. Current literature on training-induced behavioral and brain plasticity in inhibitory control suggests that improvements may follow either from the development of automatic forms of inhibition or from the strengthening of top-down, controlled inhibition. Automatic inhibition develops in conditions of consistent and repeated associations between inhibition-triggering stimuli and stopping goals. Once established, the stop signals directly elicit inhibition, thereby bypassing slow, top-down executive control and <b>accelerating</b> <b>stopping</b> processes. In contrast, training regimens involving varying stimulus-response associations or frequent inhibition failures prevent the development of automatic inhibition and thus strengthen top-down inhibitory processes rather than bottom-up ones. We discuss these findings in terms of developing optimal inhibitory control training regimens for rehabilitation purposes...|$|R

40|$|Solar flares {{are known}} to {{accelerate}} electrons to high energies, resulting in the movement of these particles throughout the Sun's atmosphere. Although this has been known {{since the middle of}} the last century, it is still unknown quite how these particles are accelerated, how they are transported and where the energization takes place. This thesis is concerned with these key questions of solar physics, using a mixture of analytical and numerical modelling in conjunction with the valuable diagnostic tool of the X-rays observed by the Reuven-Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). First, imaging spectroscopy with RHESSI is shown, focussing on how to infer to the underlying electron distribution producing the X-ray photons and how this can be used to produce more realistic models. Secondly, a model where the region in which the electrons are <b>accelerated,</b> <b>stopped</b> and emit X-rays is the same is presented, driven specifically by observations of such sources by RHESSI. This admits a steady-state kappa distribution solution and it is shown that the relaxation of an originally thermal Maxwellian population of electrons to this final state proceeds as a wavefront in velocity space. Finally, a model which takes account of recent studies showing the extended nature of the acceleration region within the loops of solar flares is considered. For the first time the intrinsic spatial dependencies of acceleration and transport are explicitly studied, showing the importance of accounting for this in future modelling of solar flares...|$|R
