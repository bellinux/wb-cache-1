5|$|The {{frequency}} of a photon {{is proportional to}} its energy. As a bound electron transitions between different energy levels of an atom, it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies. For instance, when atoms are irradiated by a source with a broad spectrum, distinct absorption lines appear in the spectrum of transmitted radiation. Each element or molecule displays a characteristic set of spectral lines, such as the hydrogen spectral series. Spectroscopic measurements of the strength <b>and</b> <b>width</b> of these lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.|$|E

5|$|Afrasia {{is known}} from four {{isolated}} teeth: a first upper molar (M1), with {{a length of}} 2.13mm <b>and</b> <b>width</b> of 3.06mm; a second upper molar (M2), the holotype, of 2.27mm by 3.35mm; a second lower molar (m2) of 2.09mm by 1.41mm; and a third lower molar (m3) of 2.05mm by 1.27mm. Like other eosimiiforms, {{it was a small}} primate that weighed around , which is estimated based on the measurements of its m2 and M1, respectively. It is generally similar to other eosimiiforms in general and Afrotarsius in particular; some distinguishing features are the well-developed small cusps (conules) on the upper molars, the variable development of the lingual cingulum (a shelf on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth) of the upper molars, and the unreduced talonid (posterior portion) on the m3. Its teeth are smaller than those of the eosimiids Phenacopithecus, Bahinia, and Phileosimias.|$|E
5|$|After the ε ring, the α and β {{rings are}} the {{brightest}} of Uranus's rings. Like the ε ring, they exhibit regular variations in brightness <b>and</b> <b>width.</b> They are brightest and widest 30° from the apoapsis and dimmest and narrowest 30° from the periapsis. The α and β rings have sizable orbital eccentricity and non-negligible inclination. The widths of these rings are 4.8–10km and 6.1–11.4km, respectively. The equivalent optical depths are 3.29km and 2.14km, resulting in normal optical depths of 0.3–0.7 and 0.2–0.35, respectively. During a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the rings disappeared, {{which means they}} are geometrically thin like the ε ring and devoid of dust. However, the same event revealed a thick and optically thin dust band just outside the β ring, which was also observed earlier by Voyager 2. The masses of the α and β rings {{are estimated to be}} about 5kg (each)—half the mass of the ε ring.|$|E

He proposed that they were intended as wings of a five-part polyptych altarpiece.

5|$|At {{the south}} end of {{corridor}} lies an antechamber, which is located directly under the tip of the pyramid. The antechamber is oriented on the east–west axis and leads west to the king's burial chamber. The burial chamber has the same height <b>and</b> <b>width</b> as the antechamber, but is longer. At the western end of the burial chamber Perring discovered some fragments of an empty and undercorated black basalt sarcophagus which had been originally placed in a slight depression as well as a canopic chest. The chambers are protected from the pyramid weight by a gabled ceiling made of two large Tura limestone blocks, an architecture common to all pyramids of the 5th and 6th dynasties. The chambers are lined with the same material, while the floor pavement was lost to stone robbers.|$|E

Aspects of the design of the Norman interior are still visible in the north transept, which retains wall arcading and a broadly moulded arch leading to the sacristy, which was formerly a chapel.

5|$|When a {{continuous}} spectrum of energy is {{passed through a}} gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands in the energy output.

5|$|In 1991, bodies {{believed}} to be those of the Imperial Family and their servants were finally exhumed from a mass grave in the woods outside Yekaterinburg. The grave had been found nearly a decade earlier, but was kept hidden by its discoverers from the Communists who still ruled Russia when the grave was originally found. Once the grave was opened, the excavators realized that instead of eleven sets of remains (Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, Tsarevitch Alexei, the four Grand Duchesses, Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia; the family's doctor, Yevgeny Botkin; their valet, Alexei Trupp; their cook, Ivan Kharitonov; and Alexandra's maid, Anna Demidova) the grave held only nine. Alexei and, according to the late forensic expert Dr. William Maples, Anastasia were missing from the family's grave. Russian scientists contested this, however, and claimed it was Maria's body that was missing. The Russians identified Anastasia by using a computer program to compare photos of the youngest Grand Duchess with the skulls of the victims from the mass grave.
