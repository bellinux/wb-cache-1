5|$|Adult and {{juvenile}} finetooth sharks form large schools. This energetic, fast-moving predator feeds mainly on small bony fishes, often entering the surf zone {{during the day}} to hunt. The most important prey of this species in the northwestern Atlantic is the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> (Brevoortia tyrannus), with sharks of all ages off northwestern Florida eat almost nothing else. The menhaden are swallowed whole after the head has been removed. Other known prey species include spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), mullet (Mugil spp.), shrimp, and in one case a juvenile Atlantic sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae), {{which may have been}} scavenged from the bycatch discard of a shrimp trawler. The finetooth shark may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworm Triloculatum geeceearelensis, and unidentified species in the genera Anthobothrium, Paraorygmatobothrium, and Phoreiobothrium.|$|E
500|$|This alcid {{typically}} fed in shoaling {{waters that}} were shallower than those frequented by other alcids, although after the breeding season, {{they had been}} sighted as far as [...] from land. They {{are believed to have}} fed cooperatively in flocks. Their main food was fish, usually [...] in length and weighing , but occasionally their prey was up to half the bird's own length. Based on remains associated with great auk bones found on Funk Island and on ecological and morphological considerations, it seems that <b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> and capelin were their favoured prey. Other fish suggested as potential prey include lumpsuckers, shorthorn sculpins, cod, sand lance, as well as crustaceans. The young of the great auk are believed to have eaten plankton and, possibly, fish and crustaceans regurgitated by adults.|$|E
500|$|The {{great auk}} was [...] tall and weighed about , {{making it the}} second-largest member of the alcid family (Miomancalla was larger). It had a black back and a white belly. The black beak was heavy and hooked, with grooves on its surface. During summer, great auk plumage showed a white patch over each eye. During winter, the great auk lost these patches, instead {{developing}} a white band stretching between the eyes. The wings were only [...] long, rendering the bird flightless. Instead, the great auk was a powerful swimmer, a trait that it used in hunting. Its favourite prey were fish, including <b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> and capelin, and crustaceans. Although agile in the water, it was clumsy on land. Great auk pairs mated for life. They nested in extremely dense and social colonies, laying one egg on bare rock. The egg was white with variable brown marbling. Both parents participated in the incubation of the egg for around 6 weeks before the young hatched. The young left the nest site after 2-3 weeks, although the parents continued to care for it.|$|E
50|$|Over {{five days}} in 1972, the plant's primary cooling system killed an {{estimated}} 150 million <b>Atlantic</b> fingerling <b>menhaden.</b>|$|R
50|$|Atlantic tripletails are {{opportunistic}} eaters; {{they feed}} {{on a variety}} of foods, mostly small finfish such as gulf <b>menhaden,</b> <b>Atlantic</b> bumpers, and anchovies. They also feed on invertebrates such as blue crabs and brown shrimp, as well as other benthic crustaceans.|$|R
5000|$|Gulf {{menhaden}} {{are commonly}} 8 {{inches in length}} but can reach 12 inches. Gulf menhaden are a dull silver with a greenish back. Like their <b>Atlantic</b> counterpart, Gulf <b>menhaden</b> have a prominent black spot found behind the gill cover followed by a row of smaller spots ...|$|R
2500|$|The Chesapeake Bay {{is home to}} {{numerous}} fauna that either migrate to the Bay {{at some point during}} the year or live there year-round. [...] There are over 300 species of fish and numerous shellfish and crab species. Some of these include the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden,</b> striped bass, American eel, eastern oyster, and the blue crab.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> are preyed upon by fish such as striped bass, {{weakfish}} and bluefish, and by birds such as ospreys and eagles. [...] Humpback whales off {{the coast}} of New Jersey feed on <b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden.</b> [...] Other cetaceans, such as fin whales and dolphins also eat menhaden. [...] Dolphins can eat up to 20 pounds of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> a day.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> {{range from}} Jupiter Inlet, Florida, to Nova Scotia; <b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> {{seasonally}} migrate along the coast; in June, mature adults typically {{are in the}} northern portion of the coastline with sub-adults and juveniles located in the southern portion ...|$|E
5|$|The fish is carnivorous, {{with its}} prey {{consisting}} mainly of benthic invertebrates and fishes. Such food items include polychaetes, gastropods, bivalve mollusks, rock crabs, cancer crabs, spider crabs, lobsters, shrimps, squids, and fishes including spiny dogfish, alewife, <b>Atlantic</b> herring, <b>menhaden,</b> hakes, sculpins, cunner, tautog, sand lance, butterfish, and various flounders. Juveniles primarily subsist on benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes, copepods, amphipods, isopods, crangon shrimp, and euphausiids. Individuals {{have been found}} with the denticles on the snout worn smooth, indicating that the snout is used to dig in the mud or sand to obtain bivalve mollusks.|$|R
50|$|The {{reduction}} fishery processes whole menhaden into fish meal, fish oil, {{and fish}} solubles while the bait fishery supplies fishermen with menhaden as bait for key commercial and recreational fisheries. Both menhaden fisheries use {{a process known}} as purse seine fishing, in which two fishing boats surround a single school of fish with a large net. Purse seining {{is one of the most}} efficient methods of fishing available, with one of the lowest levels of bycatch. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization has cited the <b>Atlantic</b> and Gulf <b>menhaden</b> fisheries as having one of the lowest levels of bycatch in the world. The reduction fishery is largely based in the Chesapeake Bay and nearby Atlantic waters, and its season runs annually starting in May through the fall.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} marine {{fish in the}} Sound include porgy, butterfish, winter flounder, summer flounder, {{windowpane}} flounder, fourspot flounder, northern and striped sea robin, little skate, <b>menhaden,</b> <b>Atlantic</b> silversides, black seabass, blackfish (tautog), cunner, bluefish, and smooth dogfish. Frequently Atlantic bonito and false albacore, both members of the tuna family, enter the sound and can be caught by anglers from small boats and shore. Many species have declined rapidly since 1975 due to over fishing. Winter flounder may not be currently present except for rare, small local populations. Tautog and summer flounder are also less numerous. Anadromous fishes include striped bass, white perch, alewives, blueback herring, and American and hickory shad. Although several shark species likely infrequently wander {{in and out of}} the Sound, e.g. blue shark, mako shark, hammerhead shark & thresher shark, there are only four species of sharks which are regularly found in the area. These are the sand tiger shark, the sandbar shark, the spiny dogfish and the smooth dogfish.|$|R

50|$|Paralichthys dentatus (Linnaeus, 1766), {{also called}} a fluke, {{is a member}} of the large-tooth {{flounder}} family Paralichthyidae. There are typically 5 to 14 ocellated (eye-like) spots on the body. Like most members of the left-eye flounders, they can change the color and pattern of their dark side to match the surrounding bottom, and are also capable of rapidly burrowing into muddy or sandy bottoms. The teeth are quite sharp and well developed on both upper and lower jaws. The average summer flounder reaches sexual maturity at 2 years and weighs 1 to 3 pounds, typically 15 to 20 inches in length, though they may grow as large as 26 pounds and live up to 20 years with females making up the largest and oldest specimens. Adults are highly predatory and considered mostly piscivorous, often lying buried with only their head exposed to ambush prey which includes sand lance, <b>menhaden,</b> <b>atlantic</b> silverside, mummichog killifish, small bluefish, porgies, squid, shrimp, and crabs. While primarily considered a bottom fish, they are rapid swimmers over short distances and can become very aggressive, feeding actively at middepths, even chasing prey to the surface.|$|R
40|$|Lipid pro-oxidative {{properties}} and deoxygenation/autoxidation patterns of hemoglobins from nonmigratory white-fleshed fish (winter flounder and Atlantic pollock) and migratory dark-fleshed fish (<b>Atlantic</b> mackerel and <b>menhaden)</b> were compared during ice storage at pH 7. 2 and 6. A washed cod mince model {{system and a}} buffer model system were used for studying lipid changes and hemoglobin changes, respectively. TBARS and painty odor were followed as markers for lipid oxidation. At pH 6, all four hemoglobins were highly and equally active as pro-oxidants. At pH 7. 2, pro-oxidation by all hemoglobins except that from pollock was slowed down, and activity ranked as pollock > mackerel > menhaden > flounder. The higher catalytic activities of the hemoglobins at pH 6 than at pH 7. 2 corresponded with higher formation of deoxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin. Pollock had the most extensive formation of deoxy- and methemoglobin at both pH values, which could explain its high catalytic activity. The pro-oxidative differences among the other hemoglobins at pH 7. 2 did not correlate with deoxygenation and autoxidation reactions. This indicates involvement of other structural differences between the hemoglobins such as differences in the heme-crevice volume. It is suggested that a biological reason for the species differences was their adaptations to different depths/water temperatures...|$|R
50|$|Menhaden are flat, have soft flesh, and {{a deeply}} forked tail. They rarely exceed 15 in in length, {{and have a}} varied weight range. Gulf {{menhaden}} and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> are small oily-fleshed fish, bright silver, and characterized {{by a series of}} smaller spots behind the main, Humeral spot. They tend to have larger scales than Yellowfin menhaden and Finescale menhaden. In addition, Yellowfin menhaden tail rays are a bright yellow in contrast to those of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> are filter feeders, {{meaning that}} they collect food by {{filtering}} water through modifications of the branchial apparatus (gill arches and gill rakers). Atlantic menhaden’s diet depends {{on the size of}} their gill rakers, which change as menhaden age. When the rakers are smaller, which generally correspond to when they are under the age of 1, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> feed primarily on phytoplankton. As they age and their gill rakers grow larger, menhaden shift their diet to primarily consume zooplankton.|$|E

50|$|Commercially {{important}} {{species of}} Clupeidae include for instance the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> (Brevoortia tyrannus), the Atlantic and Baltic herrings (Clupea harengus), the Pacific herring (C. pallasii) and the European pilchard or sardine (Sardina pilchardus).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> can spawn {{year round}} in inshore waters off the Atlantic coast, {{with the highest}} {{spawning}} rates near North Carolina in the late fall. The eggs hatch in the open ocean and the larvae drift to sheltered estuaries via ocean currents. The young spend a year developing in these estuaries {{before returning to the}} open ocean. At this early stage, they are commonly known as [...] "peanut bunker". <b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> usually do not become sexually mature until the end of their second year, after which they reproduce until death. A young, sexually mature female can produce roughly 38,000 eggs, while a fully mature female can produce upwards of 362,000.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission {{declared}} that the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> was depleted due to overfishing. The decision was driven by issues with water quality in the Chesapeake Bay and failing efforts to re-introduce predator species, {{due to lack of}} menhaden on which they could feed.|$|E
50|$|Most {{forage fish}} are filter feeders. For example, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden,</b> {{a type of}} herring, lives on {{plankton}} caught in midwater. Adult menhaden can filter up to four gallons of water a minute and {{play an important role}} in clarifying ocean water. They are also a natural check to the deadly red tide.|$|E

50|$|Because the ASMFC’s 2010 {{assessment}} {{concluded that}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> was experiencing overfishing, some conservation, fishing {{and other organizations}} began urging the Commission to impose new harvest restrictions, and the ASMFC began the process of drafting new catch limits. This culminated the development of Amendment 2 to the menhaden Fishery Management Plan that established a total allowable catch (TAC) of 170,800 metric tons (376,549,544 pounds), effectively reducing the coastwide harvest by 20 percent compared to average landings from 2009-2011.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} years of the United States, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> were being {{harvested}} by thousand of ships of fishermen. The Atlantic coastline was lined with processing facilities to quickly transform the fish into a product of worth, typically oil but later fish meal became more popular. Tragedy of the commons set in and the menhaden population began to dwindle. Many of these small companies could not manage, which left only a handful of menhaden fishing companies to remain on the Atlantic coast.|$|E
50|$|Eggs are buoyant and hatch within 2 to 3 days {{depending}} on the temperature. The larvae will spend 1 to 3 months in waters over the continental shelf. The Chesapeake Bay is a popular nursery for juvenile menhaden. Larval fish will enter the Bay in late winter and early summer. The larval fish will move into lower salinity waters in estuarine tributaries while juvenile and immature fish remain in the Bay until the fall. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> can live up to 10 to 12 years.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>menhaden</b> {{are managed}} by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC), an interstate compact formed under an {{agreement}} by the 15 Atlantic coast states. Like with other species, the ASMFC manages menhaden to prevent overfishing {{and to keep the}} stock from being overfished. There is a subtle but distinct difference between the two designations. Overfishing occurs when too many fish are being taken from the population of a fish stock. A stock is considered overfished when it is not able to produce enough new fish to maintain the population.|$|E
