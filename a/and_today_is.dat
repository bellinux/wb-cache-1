5|$|Géricault {{chose to}} depict this event {{in order to}} launch his career with a {{large-scale}} uncommissioned work on a subject that had already generated great public interest. The event fascinated him, and before he began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of {{the flesh of the}} dying and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 Paris Salon, attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation, <b>and</b> <b>today</b> <b>is</b> widely seen as seminal in the early history of the Romantic movement in French painting.|$|E
5|$|Settled in 1666 by Puritans from New Haven Colony, Newark {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} European cities in the United States.

5|$|The roan colour is rare, <b>and</b> <b>today</b> <b>is</b> {{passed on}} via a single dam line that descends from the {{strawberry}} roan mare Sonja, foaled in 1936.

5|$|Work on {{the palace}} began in 1747 under Portuguese {{architect}} Mateus Vicente de Oliveira. Despite being far smaller, the palace {{is often referred}} to as the Portuguese Versailles. From 1826, the palace slowly fell from favour with the Portuguese sovereigns. In 1908, it became the property of the state.

5|$|Hampton National Historic Site, in the Hampton area {{north of}} Towson, Baltimore County, Maryland, USA, {{preserves}} {{a remnant of}} a vast 18th-century estate, including a Georgian manor house, gardens, grounds, and the original stone slave quarters. The estate was owned by the Ridgely family for seven generations, from 1745 to 1948. The Hampton Mansion was the largest private home in America when it was completed in 1790 <b>and</b> <b>today</b> <b>is</b> considered {{to be one of}} the finest examples of Georgian architecture in the U.S. Its furnishings, together with the estate's slave quarters and other preserved structures, provide insight into the life of late 18th-century and early 19th-century landowning aristocracy. In 1948, Hampton was the first site selected as a National Historical Site for its architectural significance by the U.S. National Park Service. The grounds were widely admired in the 19th century for their elaborate parterres or formal gardens, which have been restored to resemble their appearance during the 1820s. Several trees are more than 200years old. In addition to the mansion and grounds, visitors may tour the overseer's house and slave quarters.|$|E

5|$|The Manipuri pony is a {{breed of}} pony {{developed}} in India. Experts disagree on its exact origin, {{although they do}} {{agree that it is}} an ancient breed, possibly developed from either the Tibetan pony or a cross between the Mongolian Wild Horse and the Arabian. First mentioned in written chronicles in 1584, Manipuri ponies were used as cavalry horses throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they were in demand by the British for use as polo ponies. Breed numbers have dwindled, however, mainly due to exports, and today the population is very low. In 2007, a genetic study was conducted on the Manipuri and four other Indian equine breeds. The Manipuri was shown to be genetically close to three other Indian pony breeds, but genetically more distant from the Marwari, the sole Indian horse breed in the study. The Manipuri pony was originally bred for polo and military usage, <b>and</b> <b>today</b> <b>is</b> bred mainly for playing polo and racing, although it is also in demand for military transport use.|$|E
5|$|The River Kennet {{was made}} navigable to Newbury in 1723, and the River Avon to Bath in 1727. The Kennet and Avon Canal between Newbury and Bath was built between 1794 and 1810 by John Rennie, to convey {{commercial}} barges carrying {{a variety of}} cargoes. and is 57miles (92km) long. The two river navigations and the canal total 87miles (140km) in length. The section from Bristol to Bath is {{the course of the}} River Avon, which flows through a wide valley and has been made navigable by a series of locks and weirs. In the later 19th century and early 20th century the canal fell into disuse following competition from the Great Western Railway, who owned the canal. Between 1970 and 1990 the canal was restored, largely by volunteers, <b>and</b> <b>today</b> <b>is</b> a popular heritage tourism destination, for boating, canoeing, fishing, walking and cycling. It is also important for wildlife conservation.|$|E
5|$|The next era of Kīlauea's history {{began with}} the {{establishment}} of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory on the volcano's rim in 1912. The first permanent such installation in the United States, the observatory was the brainchild of Thomas Jaggar, head of geology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; after witnessing the devastation of the 1908 Messina earthquake near Mount Etna in Italy, he declared that something must be done to support systematic volcanic and seismic study, and chose Kīlauea as the site of the first such establishment. After securing initial funding from MIT and the University of Hawaii, Jaggar took directorship of the observatory and, whilst its head between 1912 and 1940, pioneered seismological and observational study and observation of active volcanoes. After initial funding ran out, the Observatory was successively funded by the National Weather Service, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the National Park Service, before settling on the USGS, under whose banner the observatory has been operating since 1947. The main building has been moved twice since establishment, <b>and</b> <b>today</b> <b>is</b> positioned on the northwest rim of Kīlauea's caldera.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} neotype, other fossils are known of Scelidosaurus. In 1888 Lydekker catalogued {{a large number}} of single bones, largely limb elements, and osteoderms, that had been {{acquired}} by the BMNH from the Norris collection. Owen in 1861 described a second, partial, skeleton of a juvenile animal, that later was added to the collection of Elizabeth Philpot <b>and</b> <b>today</b> <b>is</b> registered in the Lyme Regis Museum as specimen LYMPH 1997.37.4-10. As it was relatively large, Owen speculated, in the context of its presumed marine lifestyle, that Scelidosaurus might have been ovoviviparous. The short prepubis in this specimen convinced scientists that this process did not represent the main pubic body as some had thought, who had been unable to believe that the thin, backward-pointing, pubis with the Ornithischia was homologous to the forward-pointing much larger pubic bone in most reptilian groups. In more recent times, new discoveries have been made at Charmouth, not through commercial quarrying but by the efforts of amateur palaeontologists. In 1968 a second partial juvenile skeleton was described, specimen BMNH R6704, that had already been reported in 1959. Found by geologist James Frederick Jackson (1894-1966) of Charmouth, it is from a slightly younger layer, the Stonebarrow Marl Member dating to the early Pliensbachian, about 190 million years old. In 1985 Simon Barnsley, David Costain and Peter Langham excavated a partial skeleton including a very complete skull and skin impressions, which was sold to the Bristol Museum where it is registered as specimen BRSMG CE12785. Specimen CAMSMX.39256 is part of the collection of the Sedgwick Museum at Cambridge. Several specimens remain undescribed because they are in private collections. These include a two metres (7ft) long skeleton found by David Sole in 2000, perhaps the most complete non-avian dinosaur exemplar ever discovered in the British Isles. All elements of the skeleton are now known. The finds by Sole differ from the neotype in details of the armour and might represent a separate taxon or reflect sexual dimorphism.|$|E
