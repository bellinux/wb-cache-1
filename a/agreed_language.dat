40|$|The {{discussion}} in the sociology of science {{about the role of}} model systems in biology provides an invitation to reflect on whether and how similar devices operate in sociology. This paper shows that sociology relies on objects of study that receive a disproportionate amount of attention and implicitly come to stand in for a specific class of objects. But, unlike other disciplines, sociology has no <b>agreed</b> <b>language</b> or theory to classify the discipline-specific objects that it studies, which hinders explicit reflection on the use of model systems across sociological subfields. In contrast to other disciplines, which use model systems, physical copies of sociological model systems usually do not travel. Because of this, the relationship between specimen and epistemic object is less standardised in sociology than in other disciplines, which creates problems for the accumulation of knowledge. Sociology also encounters unique problems of access to model systems...|$|E

As today, there isnogenerally accepted standard for the conceptual modeling ofmanagement information systems, although several methods have been proposed so far. What has been largely neglected in all these approaches is the conceptual modeling of presentation and visualization. Since management information systems aim to inform managers and business users about significant facts, the visual representation of these facts is of great importance. In this paper, we develop aframework for the conceptual modeling of management information systems which takes presentation issues into account. Following this framework, we extend the meta-model ofanexisting modeling approach for the specification of management views with concepts for presentation modeling. We draw on existing taxonomies in order to construct asimple ontology for visualization {{in the domain of}} management information systems...|$|E
40|$|The International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (ICF) {{offers an}} <b>agreed</b> <b>language</b> {{on which a}} {{scientific}} model of functional outcomes can be built. The ICF defines functional outcomes as activity and activity limitations (AL) and defines both in behavioural terms. The ICF, therefore, appears to invite explanations of AL as behaviours. Studies of AL find that psychological variables, especially perceptions of control, add to biomedical variables in predicting AL. Therefore, two improved models are proposed, which integrate the ICF with two psychological theories, the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and social cognitive theory (SCT). These models have a sound evidence base as good predictors of behaviour, include perceived control constructs and are compatible with existing evidence about AL. When directly tested in studies of community and clinic-based populations, both integrated models (ICF/TPB and ICF/SCT) outperform {{each of the three}} basic models (ICF, TPB and SCT). However, when predicting activity rather than AL, the biomedical model of the ICF does not improve prediction of activity by TPB and SCT on their own. It is concluded that these models offer a better explanation of functional outcomes than the ICF alone and could form the basis for the development of improved models...|$|E

40|$|The {{past decade}} has been most {{promising}} {{for the development of}} a philosophical basis for Design Education in Brazil. The first meeting of directors of Brazilian Industrial Design high schools took place in 1984 in Rio de Janeiro. In 1986 in Brasilia a team of professional designers met, with the aim of evaluating almost 25 years of industrial design education in Brazil. In 1987 the Brazilian ministry of education and culture outlined the domains and approved the content of a new industrial design education curriculum. In 1988 representatives from all the Brazilian design schools met in Florian 6 polis to discuss, identify and determine guidelines for teaching design and in that same year the new national design curriculum was enforced in all high level Brazilian design courses. However, analyses of the documents published following these events show that design in Brazil is conceived as an educational practice relating only to the tertiary level and a professional activity restricted to the fields of Graphic and Industrial Design. The reason why Design in Brazil is often elitist, vocational, and restrictive appears to be related to design educators not realising the full potential of the Portuguese word desenho; and therefore, not conceptualising Design as an area of human experience, skill and knowledge that reflects man's concern with the appreciation and adaptation of his surroundings in the light of his material and spiritual needs. In particular, relating to the configuration, composition, meaning, value and purpose of man-made phenomena. Consequently, Brazilian design educators are decharacterising the Portuguese language when, treating matters related to Design, they use English terms and expressions unnecessarily. Thus, this dissertation examines design language in Brazil; and the importance of an <b>agreed</b> <b>language</b> to develop design education in the country. Chapter I is concerned with the denotations given to the words design, dessin, disegno, designo, diseno, deseno, and desenho in their respective languages; and the connotations which the human ability design has acquired within certain European cultural contexts. In Chapter II texts were investigated in order to examine concepts of Design in Brazil, and how Brazilian design educators have understood, discussed and disseminated ideas using written language. Chapter III is based on interviews with Brazilian design educators, and it focuses on the spoken language used by them to express and discuss problems of education in the country. The contribution of this dissertation to Brazilian design education, can be found in Chapters IV and V, where an attempt is made to: (i) reinforce the meanings and usage of the Portuguese word desenho; (ii) create a design terminology genuinely based on Portuguese words; and (iii) build a structural model for a design language, which can be used to reconstruct and evaluate the present curriculum of Brazilian design courses. ...|$|E
