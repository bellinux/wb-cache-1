5|$|According to {{quantum chromodynamics}} (QCD), quarks possess a {{property}} called color charge. There are {{three types of}} color charge, arbitrarily labeled blue, green, and red. Each of them is complemented by an anticolor – antiblue, antigreen, and antired. Every quark carries a color, while every <b>antiquark</b> carries an anticolor.|$|E
5|$|A hadron is a {{composite}} particle made of quarks held together by the strong force. Hadrons are categorized into two families: baryons (such as protons and neutrons) made of three quarks, and mesons (such as pions) made of one quark and one <b>antiquark.</b> Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern Universe.|$|E
5|$|Since baryons are {{composed}} of quarks, they participate in the strong interaction. Leptons, on the other hand, are not composed of quarks and as such {{do not participate in}} the strong interaction. The most famous baryons are the protons and neutrons that make up most of the mass of the visible matter in the universe, whereas electrons, the other major component of atoms, are leptons. Each baryon has a corresponding antiparticle known as an antibaryon in which quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks. For example, a proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark, while its corresponding antiparticle, the antiproton, is made of two up antiquarks and one down <b>antiquark.</b>|$|E

5|$|There are six {{types of}} quarks, known as flavors: up, down, strange, charm, top, and bottom. Up and down quarks {{have the lowest}} masses of all quarks. The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks {{through a process of}} {{particle}} decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Because of this, up and down quarks are generally stable and the most common in the universe, whereas strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and in particle accelerators). For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as an <b>antiquark,</b> that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.|$|E
25|$|Pentaquarks {{consist of}} four valence quarks and one valence <b>antiquark.</b>|$|E
25|$|Color {{confinement}} is {{verified by}} the failure of free quark searches (searches of fractional charges). Quarks are normally produced in pairs (quark + <b>antiquark)</b> to compensate the quantum color and flavor numbers; however at Fermilab single production of top quarks has been shown (technically this still involves a pair production, but quark and <b>antiquark</b> are of different flavor). No glueball has been demonstrated.|$|E
40|$|Based on the chiral kinetic {{approach}} using initial conditions from a multiphase transport model, {{we study}} the spin polarizations of quarks and <b>antiquarks</b> in non-central heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Because of the non-vanishing vorticity field in these collisions, quarks and <b>antiquarks</b> {{are found to}} acquire appreciable spin polarizations in the direction perpendicular to the reaction plane. Converting quarks and <b>antiquarks</b> to hadrons via the coalescence model, we further calculate the spin polarizations of Lambda and anti-Lambda hyperons and find their values comparable to those measured in experiments by the STAR Collaboration.

In the quark model they are understood to be bound states of a strange quark (or <b>antiquark)</b> and an up or down <b>antiquark</b> (or quark).|$|E
25|$|Although the {{discovery}} of the quarks led to reinterpretation of the rho meson as a vector bound state of a quark and an <b>antiquark,</b> it is sometimes still useful {{to think of it as}} the gauge boson of a hidden local symmetry.|$|E
25|$|Each baryon has a {{corresponding}} antiparticle (antibaryon) where quarks {{are replaced by}} their corresponding antiquarks.

25|$|The kind of CP {{violation}} {{discovered in}} 1964 {{was linked to}} the fact that neutral kaons can transform into their antiparticles (in which each quark is replaced with the other's <b>antiquark)</b> and vice versa, but such transformation does not occur with exactly the same probability in both directions; this is called indirect CP violation.|$|E
25|$|Mesons {{are part}} of the hadron {{particle}} family, and are defined simply as particles composed of two quarks. The other members of the hadron family are the baryons: subatomic particles composed of three quarks.

40|$|In {{the quantum}} {{statistical}} parton distributions approach proposed {{more than one}} decade ago, one imposes relations between quarks and <b>antiquarks</b> expressions, which lead to very specific properties for the <b>antiquarks.</b> These properties have been verified up to now by recent data {{and it is a}} real challenge also for forthcoming experimental results, mainly in the high $x$ region.

50|$|Antiprotons are {{routinely}} produced at Fermilab for collider physics {{operations in the}} Tevatron, where they are collided with protons. The use of antiprotons allows for a higher average energy of collisions between quarks and <b>antiquarks</b> than would be possible in proton-proton collisions. This is because the valence quarks in the proton, and the valence <b>antiquarks</b> in the antiproton, tend to carry the largest fraction of the proton or antiproton's momentum.|$|R
25|$|In quantum chromodynamics, a quark's color {{can take}} one of three values or charges, red, green, and blue. An <b>antiquark</b> can {{take one of}} three anticolors, called antired, antigreen, and antiblue (represented as cyan, magenta and yellow, respectively). Gluons are {{mixtures}} of two colors, such as red and antigreen, which constitutes their color charge. QCD considers eight gluons of the possible nine color–anticolor combinations to be unique; see eight gluon colors for an explanation.|$|E
25|$|Other exotic baryons {{have been}} proposed, such as pentaquarks—baryons made of four quarks and one <b>antiquark</b> (B=+++−=1), but their {{existence}} is not generally accepted. The particle physics {{community as a}} whole did not view their existence as likely in 2006,] and in 2008, considered evidence to be overwhelmingly against the existence of the reported pentaquarks. However, in July 2015, the LHCb experiment observed two resonances consistent with pentaquark states in the Λ → J/ψKp decay, with a combined statistical significance of 15. decays.|$|E
25|$|The model {{states that}} the colour {{electric}} flux between a quark and an <b>antiquark</b> collapses into a string, rather than spreading out into a Coulomb field as the normal electric flux does. This string also obeys a different force law. It behaves as if the string had constant tension, so that separating out the ends (quarks) would give a potential energy increasing linearly with the separation. When the energy is {{higher than that of}} a meson, the string breaks and the two new ends become a quark-antiquark pair, thus describing the creation of a meson. Thus confinement is incorporated naturally into the model.|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a new and unified scheme for describing both quark spin and orbital angular momenta in symmetry-breaking chiral quark model. The loss of quark spin in the chiral splitting processes is compensated by the gain of the orbital angular momentum carried by quarks and <b>antiquarks.</b> The sum of both spin and orbital angular momenta carried by quarks and <b>antiquarks</b> is 1 / 2. The analytic and numerical results for the spin and orbital angular momenta carried by quarks and <b>antiquarks</b> in the nucleon are given. Extension to other octet and decuplet baryons is also presented. Possible modification and application are discussed.

25|$|In the {{eventual}} Standard Model of particle physics codified in the 1970s, all mesons {{other than the}} mu meson were understood to be hadrons—that is, particles made of quarks—and thus subject to the nuclear force. In the quark model, a meson was no longer defined by mass (for some had been discovered that were very massive—more than nucleons), but instead were particles composed of exactly two quarks (a quark and <b>antiquark),</b> unlike the baryons, which are defined as particles composed of three quarks (protons and neutrons were the lightest baryons). Mu mesons, however, had shown themselves to be fundamental particles (leptons) like electrons, with no quark structure. Thus, mu mesons were not mesons at all, in the new sense {{and use of the}} term meson used with the quark model of particle structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposal}} of Kobayashi and Maskawa heavily {{relied on the}} GIM mechanism put forward by Sheldon Lee Glashow, John Iliopoulos and Luciano Maiani, which predicted {{the existence of the}} then still unobserved charm quark. When in November 1974 teams at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) simultaneously announced the discovery of the J/ψ meson, it was soon after identified as a bound state of the missing charm quark with its <b>antiquark.</b> This discovery allowed the GIM mechanism {{to become part of the}} Standard Model. With the acceptance of the GIM mechanism, Kobayashi and Maskawa's prediction also gained in credibility. Their case was further strengthened by the discovery of the tau by Martin Lewis Perl's team at SLAC between 1974 and 1978. This announced a third generation of leptons, breaking the new symmetry between leptons and quarks introduced by the GIM mechanism. Restoration of the symmetry implied the existence of a fifth and sixth quark.|$|E
500|$|The {{system of}} {{attraction}} and repulsion between quarks charged with {{different combinations of}} the three colors is called strong interaction, which is mediated by force carrying particles known as gluons; this is discussed at length below. The theory that describes strong interactions is called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). A quark, which will have a single color value, can form a bound system with an <b>antiquark</b> carrying the corresponding anticolor. The result of two attracting quarks will be color neutrality: a quark with color charge ξ plus an <b>antiquark</b> with color charge −ξ {{will result in a}} color charge of 0 (or [...] "white" [...] color) and the formation of a meson. This is analogous to the additive color model in basic optics. Similarly, the combination of three quarks, each with different color charges, or three antiquarks, each with anticolor charges, will result in the same [...] "white" [...] color charge and the formation of a baryon or antibaryon.|$|E
25|$|Now, imagine {{starting}} at the bottom left corner of the phase diagram, in the vacuum where μ=T=0. If we heat up the system without introducing any preference for quarks over <b>antiquarks,</b> this corresponds to moving vertically upwards along the T axis. At first, quarks are still confined and we create a gas of hadrons (pions, mostly). Then around T=150MeV there is a crossover to the quark gluon plasma: thermal fluctuations break up the pions, and we find a gas of quarks, <b>antiquarks,</b> and gluons, as well as lighter particles such as photons, electrons, positrons, etc. Following this path corresponds to travelling far back in time (so to say), {{to the state of}} the universe shortly after the big bang (where there was a very tiny preference for quarks over <b>antiquarks).</b>|$|R
