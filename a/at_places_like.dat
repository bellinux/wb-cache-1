5|$|Gimmick! {{initially}} garnered lackluster {{interest and}} mixed reviews from publications like Famitsu, Electronic Gaming Monthly, and Nintendomagasinet. This lack of popularity was blamed on casual players {{being unable to}} handle the difficulty, and the industry's transition to newer 16-bit consoles like the Super NES and Mega Drive. When Gimmick! was exhibited <b>at</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> the Tokyo Toy Show, Sakai recalled that he was hoping a dealer would see Gimmick! as a next-generation title developed for the original Nintendo and distribute it, only for them to lose interest once they learned it was an NES game. In retrospect, he joked that the game took 10 years for people to appreciate.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Kilburn entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, {{with a state}} scholarship, {{a county}} major scholarship, and a minor open scholarship, where he studied mathematics.

After Japanese troops stormed the city, the German dead were buried at Tsingtao and the remaining troops were transported to Japan where they were treated with respect <b>at</b> <b>places</b> <b>like</b> the Bandō Prisoner of War camp.
