Afterward, the Poles went on to invade Galicia, with some success, but the offensive quickly stalled with heavy casualties. The Austrians also won a few battles but were hampered {{by the presence of}} Russian troops whose intentions were unclear <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not allow them to advance. Eventually, the defeat of the main Austrian army at Wagram decided of the fate of the war.|$|E

500|$|In the 17th century, the {{new method}} {{of modern science}} {{rejected}} the Aristotelian approach. It sought explanations of natural phenomena in terms of physical laws that were {{the same for all}} visible things <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not require the existence of any fixed natural categories or divine cosmic order. However, this new approach was slow to take root in the biological sciences, the last bastion of the concept of fixed natural types. John Ray applied one of the previously more general terms for fixed natural types, [...] "species," [...] to plant and animal types, but he strictly identified each type of living thing as a species and proposed that each species could be defined by the features that perpetuated themselves generation after generation. The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 explicitly recognised the hierarchical nature of species relationships, but still viewed species as fixed according to a divine plan.|$|E
500|$|Lynch is an {{advocate}} {{for health care reform}} but split with his party on Obama's health care reform efforts. He voted in November 2009 to pass the Affordable Health Care for America Act (AHCAA), the House's health care reform bill. This bill was scrapped by Congressional leaders in favor of the Senate's bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Despite pressure from Obama and Democratic leaders, Lynch stated that he would oppose the PPACA until [...] "they put reform back in the health reform bill." [...] He described the Senate bill as a [...] "surrender" [...] to insurance companies, putting too little pressure on insurance companies to reduce costs, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not represent meaningful reform. He explained, [...] "There's a difference between compromise and surrender, right? And this is a complete surrender {{of all the things that}} people thought were important to health care reform." [...] When the PPACA came to a House vote in March 2010, he was the only U.S. representative from New England to vote against it.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were eight}} [...] demi-culverin drakes {{weighing}} 7.7 tons (7700kg) in the forecastle; another six weighing 5.7 tons (5700kg) on the half-deck. The quarter-deck carried two six-foot demi-culverin drake cutts – a cutt, again, being a shorter {{version of a}} gun – weighing 16 hundredweight (726kg). Then there were another two six-foot culverin cutts, weighing 1.3 tons (1,179kg), aft of the forecastle bulkhead. In all, Sovereign of the Seas carried 155.9 tons (141,430kg) of guns – <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not include {{the weight of the}} gun carriages.

2500|$|The final {{redistricting}} {{plan was}} less ambitious but still made the already heavily Democratic 8th district even more Democratic. It restored a heavily Democratic spur of eastern Montgomery County removed in the 1990 redistricting and added nine precincts in Prince George's County from Al Wynn's heavily Democratic [...] Although it forced Van Hollen and Shriver {{to run against}} each other in an expensive primary, Van Hollen defeated Morella in 2002 with 52 percent of the vote to Morella's 47 percent. Van Hollen trounced her in the Prince George's portion of the district, an area that Morella did not know <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not know her. However, Morella also lost the Montgomery portion of the district 51% to 48%. She carried only some of the precincts she had previously represented. Proving just how Democratic this district was, the Republicans have only put up nominal challengers in the 8th since Morella's defeat; none of them have cracked the 40 percent barrier.|$|E
2500|$|Holden's {{district}} was drastically reconfigured {{as a result}} of legislative redistricting done in the Pennsylvania legislature in late 2011 following the results of the 2010 Census. [...] While keeping most of Holden's hometown region, including St. Clair, the district lost Harrisburg and Lebanon, along with its shares of portions of Berks, Dauphin, Lebanon and Perry counties. [...] In their place, the legislature pushed the district well to the north and east, adding Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Pittston, and Easton, among other various towns in Luzerne County, Lackawanna County, Carbon County, Monroe County and Northampton County—territory {{that he did not know}} <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not know him. [...] As a result of these changes, the 17th is now considerably more Democratic than its predecessor, nearing 60 percent Democratic registration and leaving Holden vulnerable to a challenge to his left in the Democratic primary. [...] Also, the League of Conservation Voters put Tim Holden on their [...] "Dirty Dozen" [...] list, targeting him for supporting then-President George W. Bush's energy policy, favoring oil production, and opposing President Obama's polices including development of clean energy.|$|E
2500|$|After the vote, {{alderman}} Joni Painter discovered {{from the}} school website that Fruin {{was a member of}} the CCHS Board of Trustees, an interest not previously disclosed. Council members also learned that CCHS could renew the lease for its current practice field for up to another fifteen years. Fruin and CCHS principal Sean Foster stated they had believed the contract could not be renewed past 2015. [...] Mayor Tari Renner refused to sign-off on the approval pending an attorney general opinion on whether any conflict of interest law or ordinance was violated. Fruin stated he would defer to the attorney general <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not believe there was a conflict of interest because trustees serve only an advisory role. A Pantagraph editorial later suggested several other potential conflicts of interest: the Deneen family - who donated land for the new school building - were stakeholders in the development firm from which the land would be purchased, Fruin's real estate agency - Coldwell Banker - was to oversee the transaction though he would have no role, and CCHS football coach Mike Moews is the brother of city parks superintendent Bobby Moews.|$|E
