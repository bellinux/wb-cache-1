2500|$|Slow {{sand filters}} {{may be used}} where there is {{sufficient}} land and space, as the water must be passed very slowly through the filters. These filters rely on biological treatment processes for their action rather than physical filtration. The filters are carefully constructed using graded layers of sand, with the coarsest sand, along with some gravel, {{at the bottom and}} finest sand at the top. Drains at the base convey treated water away for disinfection. Filtration depends on the development of a thin biological layer, called the zoogleal layer or Schmutzdecke, {{on the surface of the}} filter. An effective slow sand filter may remain in service for many weeks or even months if the pretreatment is well designed and produces water with a very low <b>available</b> <b>nutrient</b> level which physical methods of treatment rarely achieve. Very low nutrient levels allow water to be safely sent through distribution systems with very low disinfectant levels, thereby reducing consumer irritation over offensive levels of chlorine and chlorine by-products. Slow sand filters are not backwashed; they are maintained by having the top layer of sand scraped off when flow is eventually obstructed by biological growth.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{enrichment}} {{media that}} have been extensively used to grow most of the algae species: Walne medium and the Guillard's F/2 medium. These commercially <b>available</b> <b>nutrient</b> solutions may reduce time for preparing all the nutrients required to grow algae. However, due to their complexity {{in the process of}} generation and high cost, they are not used for large-scale culture operations. Therefore, enrichment media used for mass production of algae contain only the most important nutrients with agriculture-grade fertilizers rather than laboratory-grade fertilizers.|$|E
40|$|Root system {{development}} in the early phases of plant ontogeny Seed germination and subsequential developement of the root system is a critical stage of life of a newly rising plant. The plant must recognise and suitably and quickly find {{an answer to the}} environmental conditions in which it finds itself. However, {{the way in which the}} root system develops and its final architecture depends not only on the environmental conditions but also on the plant itself. In addition, responses to different conditions may vary among different plant species. This work examines the developement of a root system in the first four weeks of a plant's life. It observes the dependence on the amount of <b>available</b> <b>nutrients</b> in the substrate and on the amount of <b>available</b> <b>nutrients</b> the seed is given by the mother plant. It also briefly touches on the relations between seed germination, seed size and the amount of <b>available</b> <b>nutrients.</b> No differences relating to the amount of <b>available</b> <b>nutrients</b> were found in seed germination. However, differences in germination speeds were found between plant species. Plant biomass increases with the increasing amount of <b>available</b> <b>nutrients</b> in the substrate. This increase is relatively greater for plant species with a small seed size. Plant species with a big seed size invest relatively more [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Increased {{flooding}} {{also allows}} for saltwater intrusion, changing the salinity levels and killing off species of plants that normally grew and changing <b>available</b> <b>nutrient,</b> chemical, and oxygen levels as well. An increase in salinity leads to higher sulfate concentrations and higher sulfide emissions, and higher toxicity. It also results in a reduction of sulfur availability to plant species as it precipitates with trace metals such as zinc and copper. An {{example of this is}} Ferrous sulfide (FeS), which gives wetland soils their black color and is the source of sulfur commonly found in coal deposits.|$|E
5000|$|Slow- or controlled-release {{fertilizer}}: A fertilizer {{containing a}} plant nutrient {{in a form}} which delays its availability for plant uptake and use after application, or which extends its availability to the plant significantly longer than a reference ‘rapidly <b>available</b> <b>nutrient</b> fertilizer’ such as ammonium nitrate or urea, ammonium phosphate or potassium chloride. Such delay of initial availability or extended time of continued availability may occur {{by a variety of}} mechanisms. These include controlled water solubility of the material by semi-permeable coatings, occlusion, protein materials, or other chemical forms, by slow hydrolysis of water-soluble low molecular weight compounds, or by other unknown means.|$|E
50|$|Using this method, plant breeders search seed or {{germplasm}} {{banks for}} existing varieties of crops which are naturally high in nutrients. They then crossbreed these high-nutrient varieties with high-yielding varieties of crops, {{to provide a}} seed with high yields and increased nutritional value. Crops must be bred with sufficient amounts of nutrients to have a measurable positive impact on human health. As such, they must be developed with the involvement of nutritionists who study whether the consumers of the improved crop can absorb the extra nutrients, {{and the extent to}} which storage, processing, and cooking of the crops affect their <b>available</b> <b>nutrient</b> levels. Bread wheat with high grain iron and zinc has been developed through radiation breeding.|$|E

5000|$|An {{alternative}} hypothesis is [...] "primitive food processing": {{it is possible}} that [...] "chemical reactions in the soil helped to transform the foods to more palatable products than could be made fresh"—especially given the absence of salt in bog butters—or increase <b>available</b> <b>nutrient</b> content. [...] In traditional cuisines, burial is a fairly common step in the preparation of highly perishable foods such as meat and dairy products; examples include century eggs (China), gravad lax (Scandinavia), hákarl (Iceland), the Inuit dishes igunaq and kiviaq, and Moroccan smen. Modern experiments in creating bog butter yield a product that seems to be an acquired taste, with [...] "flavor notes which were described primarily as ‘animal’ or ‘gamey’, ‘moss’, ‘funky’, ‘pungent’, and ‘salami’.

5000|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} beneficial processes performed by rhizobacteria. Nitrogen is a vital nutrient to plants and gaseous nitrogen (N2) is not available to them due to the high energy required to break the triple bonds between the two atoms. Rhizobacteria, through nitrogen fixation, are able to convert gaseous nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) making it an <b>available</b> <b>nutrient</b> to the host plant which can support and enhance plant growth. The host plant provides the bacteria with amino acids so they do not need to assimilate ammonia. The amino acids are then shuttled back to the plant with newly fixed nitrogen. Nitrogenase is an enzyme involved in nitrogen fixation and requires anaerobic conditions. Membranes within root nodules are able to provide these conditions. The rhizobacteria require oxygen to metabolize, so oxygen is provided by a hemoglobin protein called leghemoglobin which is produced within the nodules. Legumes are well-known nitrogen-fixing crops and have been used for centuries in crop rotation to maintain the health of the soil.|$|E
50|$|Growth is also {{determined}} by environmental factors, such as temperature, available water, available light, {{carbon dioxide and}} <b>available</b> <b>nutrients</b> in the soil. Any change in the availability of these external conditions will {{be reflected in the}} plant's growth.|$|R

50|$|However, in Australia and Southern Africa, {{the story}} is different. Here, runoff {{variability}} {{is much higher than}} in other continental regions of the world with similar climates. Typically temperate (Köppen climate classification C) and arid (Köppen climate classification B) climate rivers in Australia and Southern Africa have as much as three times the coefficient of variation of runoff of those in other continental regions. The reason for this is that, whereas all other continents have had their soils largely shaped by Quaternary glaciation and mountain building, soils of Australia and Southern Africa have been largely unaltered since at least the early Cretaceous and generally since the previous ice age in the Carboniferous. Consequently, <b>available</b> <b>nutrient</b> levels in Australian and Southern African soils tend to be orders of magnitude lower than those of similar climates in other continents, and native flora compensate for this through much higher rooting densities (e.g. proteoid roots) to absorb minimal phosphorus and other nutrients. Because these roots absorb so much water, runoff in typical Australian and Southern African rivers does not occur until about 300 mm (12 inches) or more of rainfall has occurred. In other continents, runoff will occur after quite light rainfall due to the low rooting densities.|$|E
50|$|The {{bacterial}} cell's {{control system}} has a hierarchical organization. The signaling {{and the control}} subsystem interfaces with the environment by means of sensory modules largely located on the cell surface. The genetic network logic responds to signals received from the environment and from internal cell status sensors to adapt the cell to current conditions. A major function of the top level control {{is to ensure that}} the operations involved in the cell cycle occur in the proper temporal order. In Caulobacter, this is accomplished by the genetic regulatory circuit composed of five master regulators and an associated phospho-signaling network. The phosphosignaling network monitors the state of progression of the cell cycle and plays an essential role in accomplishing asymmetric cell division. The cell cycle control system manages the time and place of the initiation of chromosome replication and cytokinesis as well as the development of polar organelles. Underlying all these operations are the mechanisms for production of protein and structural components and energy production. The “housekeeping” metabolic and catabolic subsystems provide the energy and the molecular raw materials for protein synthesis, cell wall construction and other operations of the cell. The housekeeping functions are coupled bidirectionally to the cell cycle control system. However, they can adapt, somewhat independently of the cell cycle control logic, to changing composition and levels of the <b>available</b> <b>nutrient</b> sources.|$|E
