5|$|The Secret River is a {{story of}} Magical realism, {{blending}} real life and fantasy. Young Calpurnia is an aspiring poet living in rural Central Florida during the Great Depression. Hard times have come to her people; the animals have disappeared, her father is unable to catch fish to sell, and everyone in the community is too weak from hunger to work. Calpurnia bravely leaves home with her little dog, Buggy-Horse, to find the secret river that her neighbor Mother Albirtha has told her about. She intends to catch fish for her father to sell in his shop. When she finds the river she politely asks it to allow her to catch some fish and uses her creativity, and the pink ribbons from her hair, to catch them. On her way home, an owl, a bear and a panther each challenge her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> give away some of her catch to get home. She also shares some fish with Mother Albirtha and takes the rest to her father, who gives them to the starving people in return for future payment. Strengthened by the fish, people begin working again. When the crisis is past Calpurnia searches for the river again, but cannot find it, as she no longer really needs it. Still, she realizes nothing is lost to us forever, and the book ends with one of her poems, expressing this sentiment:Secret River is in my mind.|$|E

Ethel is so excited that she shows Reggie a saucy nightie she has bought for the trip. When Dot, Marge Green (Pat Coombs) and Mo Butcher (Edna Doré) find out about the trip, they decide to go as well. Reggie arranges dancing partners for them and the ladies practise hard at the community centre for months before the trip. But upon arriving on holiday, Ethel grows disappointed in Reggie when he starts to show interest in another woman named Gladys. On the night of the dancing competition, Ethel finds that Reggie has run off with Gladys and she has no partner in the grand ballroom except for her 'little Willy'.

Regulars at The Queen Victoria pub raise money to buy Ethel a new dog, but she refuses to accept it, saying Willy is irreplaceable. By the mid 1990s Ethel is seen much less frequently.

After 1997 Ethel is not seen in Walford for three years, although she is mentioned often, particularly by Dot, who will often visit her off-screen in her sheltered housing.|$|E

500|$|Jim Farber of the Daily News {{said the}} pre-chorus {{was the most}} {{repetitive}} in a pop song since The Shaggs's [...] "Gimmie Dat Ding".

The song has been nominated for a Grammy Award {{in the category of}} Best Dance Recording on December 2, 2009.

500|$|Susan meets Jim at the {{hospital}} and remembers him from the work he did on Lyn Scully's (Janet Andrewartha) house. They get talking and Jim reveals he just had a melanoma removed and he is a bit [...] "bewildered" [...] by {{the hospital}} process and Susan helps him out. Jim's condition grows worse and he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Susan learns he has no family and Woodburne said she instinctively wants to look after him. The actress said Susan crosses boundaries as she starts to neglect certain areas of her life, like her marriage. She tells Karl not to be selfish and that the situation is not about him or her, it is about Jim. Woodburne explained to Channel 5 that Karl's reaction to Susan's friendship with Jim changes and he starts thinking he should not be selfish. However, when he notices his wife becoming more involved with Jim and neglecting her responsibilities, Karl gets angry as she is not thinking about anything else. Susan and Karl's eldest son, Malcolm, returns to Erinsborough to help his parents work through their issues. Woodburne thought Malcolm was initially on Susan's side because he can see she is helping someone who is ill, but as he looks more closely he understands why his father is so upset with Susan's behavior. Susan is upset when she misses Jim's last moments and blames Karl. They begin rowing, which becomes worse due to Susan's grief. Susan Hill of the Daily Star revealed Karl and Susan were to separate following a make-or-break holiday. Their decision leaves Malcolm devastated and he takes his anger out on his mother, but Karl then admits it was his decision to end the marriage. Woodburne said the Jim Dolan plot was [...] "a tremendous story which highlighted problems with Susan and Karl's marriage." [...] The actress said the storyline was challenging to play because it was emotional and she had to slap Fletcher. Of Susan's future, Woodburne said [...] "2012 will be a huge year of adjustment for Susan. She is now single and moves into an apartment of her own – <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> find her own way. She discovers things about herself that will surprise people." ...|$|E
500|$|Bell {{said that}} at first Anna was written plainer and more general. [...] "In {{the first draft of}} the script she was written more, in my opinion, prissy. She was kind of {{specific}} and very girly," [...] which Bell didn't find appealing. She admitted that she had always {{wanted to be part of}} Disney animated feature, but she [...] "wanted to be a very specific type of princess", who [...] "was way more awkward than the normal princesses", not someone with too good postures or too well-spoken. As she was offered the role of Anna, she came up with a lot of suggestions for the directors. They were responsive and allowed the actress to mould the character the way she wanted, since they wanted the film to be truthful. Bell significantly made specific changes to Anna, including the infusion and incorporation of the actress' own personality to the character, [...] embodying a relatable heroine, which received full support from the directors. She called the scene where Anna first meets Hans is a [...] "typical Disney moment", as they come too close physically and find out that they both fall in love with each other. Bell wanted Anna's words to reflect what she herself would say in real life, which included some [...] "nonsensical rambling". [...] "I think I said, [...] "This is awkward. You're not awkward. Me, I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. Wait—what?" [...] Words just spill out of her mouth too quickly <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> backtrack." [...] Bell continued. Or the whole scene where she wakes up in the beginning with saliva all over the face, Bell [...] "wanted her to also have hair in her mouth", which took inspiration from her own real life. [...] "Sometimes I wake up like that. Then you have hair in your mouth, and you start coughing. The animators totally got what I was trying to do. It's cool, and way more fun when stuff is realistic like that, instead of the perfection of waking up with mascara on." [...] Anna's snorting and tripping over also drew inspirations from Bell's real life. Bell's recording sessions were also videotaped to assist in animating the character, and animators took into considerations even subtle things like the actress' biting her lip a lot. According to director Jennifer Lee, Anna is a bit flawed.|$|E

These concerns echo elements of Jewish law and the prophetic books of the Old Testament, and recall the teachings of Jesus Christ recorded in the New Testament, such as his declaration that [...] "whatever you have done {{for one of these}} least brothers of Mine, you have done for Me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some shrines {{have taken}} so many slaves that they cannot contain them all. [...] Some slaves become unattractive or unuseful to the priest. [...] In these cases trokosia {{may be given}} what is called [...] "temporary" [...] release. [...] This is {{actually}} a misnomer, since it is a permanent condition. [...] The temporary part only gives the slave permission to live outside the shrine temporarily. [...] All the important decisions of her life are still controlled by the shrine, she is still at the beck and call of the priest, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> serve at the annual festival of the god every year, for which she is required to bring gifts that may take her all year to accumulate.|$|E
2500|$|Summary on {{justice and}} charity, and the Church's role. The Church cannot and must not take upon herself the {{political}} battle {{to bring about}} the most just society possible. She cannot and must not replace the State. Yet {{at the same time she}} cannot and must not remain on the sidelines in the fight for justice. She has to play her part through rational argument <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> reawaken the spiritual energy without which justice, which always demands sacrifice, cannot prevail and prosper. [...] A just society must be the achievement of politics, not of the Church. Yet the promotion of justice through efforts to bring about openness of mind and will to the demands of the common good is something which concerns the Church deeply... The Church's charitable organizations, on the other hand, constitute an opus proprium, a task agreeable to her, in which she does not cooperate collaterally, but acts as a subject with direct responsibility, doing what corresponds to her nature.

2500|$|Costumes for Broadchurch were {{designed}} by freelance costume designer Ray Holman. Holman worked with the actors portraying major characters {{to ensure that the}} costumes fit the character. He spent hours discussing the characters with the actors, and sometimes took the actors shopping or to costume suppliers to find the right look. Holman crafted the [...] "old and saggy" [...] look of Alec Hardy's character to reflect the fact that Hardy [...] "didn't really care what he wore." [...] Often arriving on the set at 6 a.m., Holman ensured that Tennant's suit was appropriately crumpled every day. Holman also designed Ellie Miller's [...] "unflattering grey work suit". Holman and actress Olivia Colman agreed that Ellie was a person who'd lived in a small town her entire life. Having been a uniformed police officer, she'd worked her way up in the ranks but still retained an unconscious desire to appear in uniform. The grey trouser suit was critical to that look. [...] "I did apologise to her about that, but it looked fantastic and characterised her," [...] Holman said. Beth Lattimer's red dress, seen in episode one, was also Holman's idea. There was disagreement about it, but Holman said he insisted on the red dress. [...] "I wanted the red dress because I knew it would move quite beautifully <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> run on the beach and I wanted the red against the cliffs," [...] he said.|$|E

2500|$|Director Masaru Konuma {{calls his}} own early S/M films [...] "European-type S/M," [...] and says, [...] "Later S/M {{developed}} in a very Japanese fashion. The Oniroku Dan way." [...] Konuma says that Dan described three purposes of S/M: [...] "for punishment, for confinement and {{for a sense of}} shame," [...] and that [...] "Oniroku Dan dislikes S as punishment... his novels and screenplays are centered around the 'humiliation' concept." [...] Dan confirmed Konuma's view by observing, [...] "My book editors often confuse S/M with cruelty and they want me to write some 'punishment tale' for them. This type of story is out of my realm. It just gives me the creeps. Rather, my concept of S/M is 'distorted sexual desire' or extreme disorientation. It's a male fantasy derived from love... from seeing a beauty suffer through the sense of shame. Therefore, my style contains a romantic, aesthetic, and sometimes decadent fragrance." [...] Konuma says of Dan's female characters, [...] "In his novels, he's searching for the beauty of women. He creates an ideal woman and proceeds to sell an S/M 'fantasy' to his readers." [...] According to Naomi Tani, Dan's perfect film actress must [...] "look good in a kimono; she needs to have long jet-black hair; she must have a certain amount of body fat, so that the bondage rope makes a clear impression on her skin; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be graceful under torture, with strong facial expressions." ...|$|E
