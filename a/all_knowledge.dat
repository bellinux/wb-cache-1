5|$|Lea {{took him}} {{to one side and}} {{informed}} him of the charges, but Corder denied <b>all</b> <b>knowledge</b> of both Maria and the crime. A search of the house uncovered a pair of pistols supposedly bought {{on the day of the}} murder, some letters from a Mr Gardener, which may have contained warnings about the discovery of the crime, and a passport from the French ambassador, evidence which suggested that Corder may have been preparing to flee.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Ayer wrote Language, Truth and Logic, {{in which}} he claimed that {{religious}} language is meaningless. He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that <b>all</b> <b>knowledge</b> must either come from observations of the world or be necessarily true, like mathematical statements. In doing so, he rejected metaphysics, which considers {{the reality of a}} world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless. Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God– theistic, atheistic and agnostic– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} H. S. Offler in 1951 {{felt that}} the Libellus was not a contemporary account of the trial, and instead dated from {{the second quarter of}} the 12th century and was produced at Durham. More recent scholars, including W. M. Aird, Frank Barlow, and Emma Mason have concluded that the work is indeed a contemporary record of the trial. Barlow bases his belief in the authenticity on the level of detail {{and the fact that the}} account lacks <b>all</b> <b>knowledge</b> of events outside the court, and explains that Offler's concerns can be explained by the late date for all the manuscripts, which allowed scribal errors to creep in.|$|E

5|$|The {{second book}} is largely {{devoted to the}} {{respective}} roles of faith and philosophical argument. Clement contends that while both are important, the fear of God is foremost, because through faith one receives divine wisdom. To Clement, scripture is an innately true primitive philosophy which is complemented by human reason through the Logos. Faith is voluntary, and the decision to believe is a crucial fundamental step in becoming closer to God. It is never irrational, as it is founded on {{the knowledge of the}} truth of the Logos, but <b>all</b> <b>knowledge</b> proceeds from faith, as first principles are unprovable outside a systematic structure.|$|E
5|$|After Spike recovers {{and has a}} final {{talk with}} Rashid, he and Elektra are {{captured}} by Cherious Medical, who want to suppress <b>all</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the nanomachines' existence. The two escape from Cherious Medical, grabbing the newly produced vaccine on the way. In turn, Faye escapes after Vincent goes to trigger {{an attack on the}} city that will eventually kill everyone on Mars. After the group reunites, it is determined that Vincent will spread the nanomachines by exploding the giant jack-o'-lantern balloons used in the Halloween parade: Jet has a troop of old aircraft spread the antibodies over the city while Faye heads for the weather control center and causes it to rain on the city, aiding the spread of the vaccine. Spike and Elektra separately head to confront Vincent. Spike arrives first and the two battle to a standstill, then the nanomachines are released and Spike is temporarily weakened by them. As Vincent prepares to kill him, Elektra arrives and shoots Vincent. Having wanted to die since Titan, Vincent does not defend himself and thanks Elektra for their time together before dying.|$|E

He also manipulates David's sister Sarah and gets her daughter Bethany into trouble with drugs. Callum attacks Sarah for framing him for a crime. Kylie hits Callum with a tool and kills him. She, Sarah and David bury Callum in a manhole under their home. They pretend to know nothing about Callum's disappearance and try to continue with their lives.

Kylie and David try to convince Sarah to keep up their pretence and deny <b>all</b> <b>knowledge</b> of his murder. Tony Stewart, who had recently died, is blamed for the murder and David helps manipulate the situation so that police also believe the theory. Kylie decides that she cannot bring her children up in the home she killed Callum. She convinces David to permanently move to Barbados to be with her sister, Becky.

5|$|Elizabeth Choy and her husband, Choy Khun Heng, {{were running}} their canteen at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, {{after all the}} {{patients}} and doctors had been moved from the Miyako Hospital (former Woodbridge Hospital). She had been a school teacher at St Andrew's School before the war. The couple helped the Changi prisoners-of-war (POW) by passing on cash and parcels containing such things as fresh clothing, medicine and letters during their deliveries. An informant told the Kempeitai that the Choys were involved in smuggling money into Changi Prison, and Khun Heng was arrested. After several days, Elizabeth went to the YMCA on Stamford Road, used by the Kempeitai as their headquarters, known as the Kempeitai East District Branch, to inquire about her husband. The Japanese denied <b>all</b> <b>knowledge</b> of him, but three weeks later they lured {{her back to the}} YMCA and confined her with other Chinese and Changi prisoners. There was no sign of Khun Heng. The prisoners were forbidden to speak to one another, although one of the internees, John Dunlop, secretly taught them to communicate in sign language.|$|E

Distributed knowledge might also be called the aggregate knowledge of a community, as it represents <b>all</b> the <b>knowledge</b> that a community might bring to bear to solve a problem. Other related phrasings include cumulative knowledge, collective knowledge, pooled knowledge, or the wisdom of the crowd. Distributed knowledge is the union of <b>all</b> the <b>knowledge</b> of individuals in a community.|$|R

25|$|At one time, {{scholars}} perceived Posidonius's {{influence in}} almost every subsequent writer, whether warranted or not. Today, Posidonius seems {{to be recognized as}} having had an inquiring and wide-ranging mind, not entirely original, but with a breadth of view that connected, in accordance with his underlying Stoic philosophy, all things and their causes and <b>all</b> <b>knowledge</b> into an overarching, unified world view.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the pre-modern era, Western civilization made a gradual transition from pre-modernity to modernity when scientific methods were developed which led many {{to believe that the}} use of science would lead to <b>all</b> <b>knowledge,</b> thus throwing back the shroud of myth under which pre-modern peoples lived. New information about the world was discovered via empirical observation, versus the historic use of reason and innate knowledge.|$|E

Thinkers such as Henri de Saint-Simon (1760-1825), Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827) and Auguste Comte (1798-1857) believed the scientific method, the circular dependence of theory and observation, must replace metaphysics {{in the history of}} thought. Émile Durkheim (1858-1917) reformulated sociological positivism as a foundation of social research.|$|R

25|$|The Oration {{also served}} as an {{introduction}} to Pico's 900 theses, which he believed to provide a complete and sufficient basis for the discovery of <b>all</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and hence a model for mankind's ascent of the chain of being. The 900 Theses are {{a good example of}} humanist syncretism, because Pico combined Platonism, Neoplatonism, Aristotelianism, Hermeticism and Kabbalah. They also included 72 theses describing what Pico believed to be a complete system of physics.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the mainstream views, the Hindu revivalist movements denied an external origin to Aryans.
