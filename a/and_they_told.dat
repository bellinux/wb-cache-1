Madetoja was five years her junior and a talented young composer. Their acquaintance gradually deepened into love. Their engagement was thrice announced in 1913, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> everyone that they had been married. In truth, Onerva and Madetoja were not married until 1918.

The flight progress strip for this flight {{had not yet been}} given to the local controller by the clearance delivery controller (another distraction), and the local controller mistakenly thought this Metroliner was SkyWest 5569 and thus the runway was clear of aircraft. The first officer of the USAir flight recalled hearing this conversation, but did not remember anyone being cleared to hold on the runway.|$|E

So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E

[...] My productions were a collection of haphazard observations, put together no doubt {{against the backdrop of}} what I had read. [...] Every beginning author does the same. [...] To be sure, this kind of work was to me a great mortification. [...] Then I began asking older authors, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> me that 'there are no rules, nor can there be any, for the art of novel-writing.' [...] Then , brought to desperation, I set about trying to resolve for myself the question: [...] 'Can literary art be reduced to general rules?' [...] After several years of observing and thinking, the matter began to get clearer for me, and as early as August 1886 I set down my first notes [...] and, God willing, I hope to publish a scientific theory of literary art.

The Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules and laughed at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Capt. Hurst printed a handbill describing the theft, and specifically charged Frank McLaury with assisting with hiding the mules. He also reproduced the flyer in The Tombstone Epitaph, on July 30, 1880. Frank McLaury angrily printed a response in the Cowboy-friendly Nuggett, calling Hurst [...] "unmanly", [...] "a coward, a vagabond, a rascal, and a malicious liar", and accused Hurst of stealing the mules himself. Capt. Hurst later cautioned Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan that the Cowboys had threatened their lives. Virgil reported that Frank accosted him and warned him, [...] "If you ever again follow us as close as you did, then you will have to fight anyway."

500|$|The pilot {{episode of}} Sit Down, Shut Up {{was written by}} series creator Mitchell Hurwitz and {{directed}} by Dwayne Carey-Hill. It was originally written by Hurwitz in 2000, but he [...] "kept it in a drawer for a long time" [...] and brought it out when he needed money. The idea for the series {{was based on the}} Australian situation comedy of the same name. He pitched his adaption to different networks that were interested in the concept, but they turned it down, because the characters were [...] "way too broad and way too self-centered and oblivious," [...] <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> him that he had to rewrite it. The Fox network picked it up in April 2008 under the name Class Dismissed, later changed to Sit Down, Shut Up. Hurwitz's adaption was originally planned to be live-action like its counterpart, but he decided to make it an animated series to [...] "avoid some work". He chose to use real images as backgrounds after he saw Mo Willems' Knuffle Bunny in a book store. He then contacted Willems to design the characters for Sit Down, Shut Up. The images for the school were taken at a school next door to the Rough Draft Studios, the series' animation studio. Production of the series halted in June 2008, when the writers found out that they would be {{under the jurisdiction of the}} IATSE Animation Guild, instead of Writers Guild of America (WGA). A month later, the writers and the production company, Sony Pictures, reached an agreement saying that the writers would still be covered by the IATSE, but their contract would be the same as the WGA's in certain areas. This made Sit Down, Shut Up the only primetime animated series on Fox not to be covered by the WGA. During this process, head writer Bill Oakley left the series.|$|E
500|$|Many {{viewers and}} fans of EastEnders {{expected}} Poppy's return {{to be only}} temporary, and thought that she would depart soon after her return. However, it was announced on 24 October that Kirkwood's successor Lorraine Newman decided that Bright will remain with EastEnders {{for the foreseeable future}} as a regular character. Upon this news, Digital Spy announced that Wood-Davis had been cast as Tansy Meadow, Poppy's younger sister, who appeared for one episode. Poppy is [...] "less than enthusiastic" [...] to hear about her sister's visit. In 30 October 2012 episode, Poppy, along with Fatboy (Norwood) host a Halloween ghost tour of the Square organised showing people where former residents have died. A BBC representative said, [...] "The backroom staff {{had a lot of fun}} planning this one". Newman stated in an interview in November 2012 that there is [...] "plenty more on the table" [...] for Poppy adding, [...] "We'll see Poppy become involved in a relationship very soon, which is progressing very well in the material we're working on at the moment. She'll become far more involved in the Square and the friendships within those groups". Digital Spy also revealed Poppy's new relationship, adding that [...] "viewers will have to wait and see who she falls for and how things pan out as the new plot develops". This was confirmed as Fatboy, and the two kiss in 22 November's episode. The pair [...] "grow close" [...] after Tansy's visit, where Fatboy acts as Poppy's [...] "high-flying" [...] businessman boyfriend in front of Tansy, trying to make herself look good in front of her [...] "successful sibling". Bright said of their relationship, [...] "It's really sweet. I don't think Poppy or Fatboy realised they liked each other as they've been friends for a while. She's unsure at first because she doesn't want to ruin a friendship. She's also been unlucky in love, so she's a little bit wary. But I think she can trust Fatboy". Bright expressed her delight at working with Norwood upon her return, after being disappointed she did not work with him during her first stint. In an interview with Metro she said, [...] "Before I started the show Fatboy was one of my favourite characters. I was gutted I didn’t work with him the first time round so when I came back <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> me about Poppy and Fatboy’s relationship, I was just so excited. Their characters are perfect for each other. Poppy and Fatboy are a little bit of light in a lot of gloom around the Square. It’s important to have a bit of comedy between everything else. I’m very lucky". She also expressed her wish for the two to get married, adding that their relationship [...] "looks long term".|$|E
