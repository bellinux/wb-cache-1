5|$|As Waters' debut novel, Tipping the Velvet {{was highly}} {{acclaimed}} and {{was chosen by}} The New York Times <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Library</b> Journal {{as one of the}} best books of 1998. Waters followed it with two other novels set in the Victorian era, both of which were also well received. Reviewers have offered the most praise for Tipping the Velvets use of humour, adventure, and sexual explicitness. The novel was adapted into a somewhat controversial three-part series of the same name produced and broadcast by the BBC in 2002 and a stage play in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Honoring Davis's war service, Governor Brown of Mississippi {{appointed}} {{him to the}} vacant position of United States Senator Jesse Speight, a Democrat, who had died on May 1, 1847.

5|$|In 1780, {{the society}} moved again, {{this time to}} Somerset House. The {{property}} was offered to the society by His Majesty's Government and, as soon as Sir Joseph Banks became president in November 1778, he began planning the move. Somerset House, while larger than Crane Court, was not satisfying to the fellows; the room to store the library was too small, the accommodation was insufficient {{and there was not}} enough room to store the museum at all. As a result, the museum was handed to the British Museum in 1781 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> was extended to two rooms, one of which was used for council meetings.|$|E

5|$|In 1802, George hired Reverend Thomas Frognall Dibdin as an {{official}} librarian {{to look after the}} collection <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> contains his many catalogues entitled Aedes Althorpianæ, documenting the books of the library. The collection became so enormous that the massive library became inadequate to hold the contents, and books began being stored along the long picture gallery on the first floor above it. By the time of George John's death in 1834, he had amassed one of the largest private collections in Europe of some 110,000 volumes. Alcoves were added {{to the ends of the}} library during the Holland restoration, creating extra room for the growing collection.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 Myron entered Dewey into {{a charity}} pet {{photograph}} contest {{as a way}} to promote the library; Dewey won the contest after receiving more than 80% of the votes.

An appearance in the June/July 1990 issue of Country magazine took Dewey's story national, after which eleven people claimed to have been the person who left Dewey in the book drop {{as a way to}} protect him from the cold.|$|E

Actual renovations took nine months <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> was officially reopened on 16 January 1998.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{plans for}} the British Library {{required}} demolition of {{an integral part of}} Bloomsbury – a seven-acre swathe of streets immediately in front of the Museum, so that the Library could be situated directly opposite.
