5|$|The Accounting Review is a {{bimonthly}} peer-reviewed academic journal covering accounting, and is {{the flagship}} journal of the American Accounting Association. Its current Senior Editor is Mark L. DeFond (University of Southern California). The journal's scope encompasses any accounting-related subject and any research methodology: as of 2010 the proportions of papers <b>accepted</b> <b>for</b> <b>publication</b> across subject areas and research methods was {{very similar to the}} proportion of papers received for review.|$|E
5|$|In October 1927, Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was <b>accepted</b> <b>for</b> <b>publication</b> by Century, and Marquis was {{prompted}} {{to take down}} his medical practice sign. However, this was premature, {{as it would be}} some time before royalties were forthcoming. Lack of funds drove Marquis to continue seeing patients and carrying out insurance medical examinations. He also needed to borrow money from relatives and cash in his war risk insurance policy. Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was published in April 1928 and received good reviews.|$|E
5|$|Gottesman did his {{graduate}} {{work at the}} University of Minnesota, which then patterned its clinical psychology program on the Boulder model, which emphasized research theory and clinical practice. He joined the graduate program in 1956 after three years with the Navy, supported by the Korean War G.I. Bill. He began investigating personality traits in identical and fraternal twins who had filled out the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). His Ph.D. thesis, submitted to Psychological Monographs, was rejected before a review {{on the grounds that}} the nature–nurture issue it addressed had already been settled in favor of nurture. On appeal, the thesis was reviewed and <b>accepted</b> <b>for</b> <b>publication.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} reputable medical {{publishers}} have trialed the open peer review concept. The first open peer review trial {{was conducted by}} The Medical Journal of Australia (MJA) {{in cooperation with the}} University of Sydney Library, from March 1996 to June 1997. In that study 56 research articles <b>accepted</b> <b>for</b> <b>publication</b> in the MJA were published online together with the peer reviewers' comments; readers could email their comments and the authors could amend their articles further before print publication of the article. The investigators concluded that the process had modest benefits for authors, editors and readers.|$|E
25|$|Buruli ulcer {{commonly}} affects {{poor people}} in remote rural areas with limited access to health care. The disease can affect all age groups, although {{children under the age}} of 15 years (range 2–14 years) are predominantly affected. There are no sex differences in the distribution of cases among children. Among adults, some studies have reported higher rates among women than males (Debacker et al. <b>accepted</b> <b>for</b> <b>publication).</b> No racial or socio-economic group is exempt from the disease. Most ulcers occur on the extremities; lesions on the lower extremities are almost twice as common as those on the upper extremities. Ulcers on the head and trunk accounted for less than 8% of cases in one large series.|$|E
