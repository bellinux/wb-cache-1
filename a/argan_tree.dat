5000|$|In Morocco, arganeraie forests now cover some [...] and are {{designated}} as a UNESCO biosphere reserve. Their area has shrunk by about half during the last 100 years, due to charcoal-making, grazing, and increasingly intensive cultivation. The best hope {{for the conservation of}} the trees may lie in the recent development of a thriving export market for argan oil as a high-value product. However, the wealth brought by argan oil export has also created threats to <b>argan</b> <b>trees</b> in the form of increased goat population. Locals use the newfound wealth to buy more goats and the goats stunt the growth of the <b>argan</b> <b>trees</b> by climbing up and eating their leaves and fruit.|$|R
50|$|The <b>argan</b> <b>tree</b> {{also helps}} {{landscape}} stability, helping to prevent soil erosion, providing shade for pasture grasses, {{and helping to}} replenish aquifers.|$|E
50|$|In {{some parts}} of Morocco, argan {{takes the place of}} the olive as a source of forage, oil, timber, and fuel in Berber society. Especially near Essaouira, the <b>argan</b> <b>tree</b> is {{frequently}} climbed by goats.|$|E
50|$|The {{fruit of}} the <b>argan</b> <b>tree</b> is small, and round, oval, or conical. A thick peel covers the fleshy pulp. The pulp {{surrounds}} a hard-shelled nut that represents about 25% {{of the weight of}} the fresh fruit.|$|E
50|$|Producing {{argan oil}} {{has helped to}} protect <b>argan</b> <b>trees</b> from being cut down. In addition, {{regeneration}} of the Arganeraie has also been carried out: in 2009 an operation to plant 4,300 argan plants was launched in Meskala {{in the province of}} Essaouira.|$|R
5000|$|Argania (Berber: ⴰⵔⴳⴰⵏ Argan) is a genus of {{flowering}} plants containing the sole species Argania spinosa, known as <b>argan,</b> a <b>tree</b> endemic to the calcareous semidesert Sous valley of southwestern Morocco and Algeria. Currently, {{it can be}} found only in an area of approximately [...] in the southwest of Morocco and Algeria (Souss-Massa-Drâa region). <b>Argan</b> <b>trees</b> grow to 8-10 m high and live up to 200 years. They are thorny, with gnarled trunks and wide spreading crown. The crown has a circumference of about 70 m and the branches lean towards the ground.|$|R
50|$|<b>Argan</b> <b>trees</b> are a {{major source}} of forage for sheep, goats, camels and cattle. Fruits and leaves are readily {{consumed}} by livestock. The press cake resulting from oil extraction can also be sun dried and fed to ruminants. Argan is also a good source of honey, as bees nest in the trees.|$|R
50|$|The <b>argan</b> <b>tree</b> {{provides}} food, {{shelter and}} protection from desertification. The trees' deep roots help prevent desert encroachment. The canopy of argan trees also provides shade for other agricultural products, {{and the leaves}} and fruit provide feed for animals.|$|E
50|$|Argan oil is a plant oil {{produced}} from the kernels of the <b>argan</b> <b>tree</b> (Argania spinosa L.) that is endemic to Morocco. In Morocco, argan oil {{is used to}} dip bread in at breakfast or to drizzle on couscous or pasta. It is also used for cosmetic purposes.|$|E
50|$|The {{success of}} the argan co-operatives has also {{encouraged}} other producers of agricultural products to adopt the co-operative model. The establishment of the co-operatives has been aided by support from within Morocco, notably the Fondation Mohamed VI pour la Recherche et la Sauvegarde de l’Arganier (Mohammed VI Foundation for Research and Protection of the <b>Argan</b> <b>Tree),</b> and from international organisations, including Canada's International Development Research Centre and the European Commission.|$|E
50|$|Extraction {{is key to}} the {{production}} process. To extract the kernels, workers first dry argan fruit in the open air and then remove the fleshy pulp. Some producers remove the flesh mechanically without drying the fruit. Moroccans usually use the flesh as animal feed. There is a tradition, in some areas of Morocco, of allowing goats to climb <b>argan</b> <b>trees</b> to feed freely on the fruits. The kernels are then later retrieved from the goat droppings, considerably reducing the labour involved in extraction at the expense of some potential gustatory aversion. In modern practice the peels are removed by hand.|$|R
40|$|A {{collection}} of thirty <b>argan</b> <b>trees</b> (Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels), representing the Aoulouz provenance in southwest of Morocco {{were used to}} study genetic variability and selection for three years. In this study, the genetic diversity of thirty genotypes (<b>tree</b> mothers) of <b>argan</b> (Argania spinosa) collected from Aoulouz was evaluated using agro-morphological characters. The main objective {{of the study was}} to assess and describe with multivariate analysis the genetic diversity in order to select good candidate trees for a future breeding program. The results obtained showed a large variation for all the traits examined. Analysis of variance using general linear model provided a significant variation between genotypes. Furthermore, genotypic and phenotypic variances for quantitative traits, particularly for seed length, seed width, almond length and oil content were higher. Phenotypic coefficient of variation was higher than genotypic coefficient of variation for all the characters. High heritability was recorded for oil content (97. 90 %), seed width (72. 68 %) and seed length (57. 55 %) respectively, indicating the additive gene action. In addition, a three dimensional plot based on principal coordinate analysis method was used to evaluate the performance genotypes as to the production of oil for three years. The genotypes ‘Ao- 12 R’, ‘Ao- 7 R’, ‘Ao- 4 R’, ‘Ao- 4 V’, ‘Ao- 11 R’, ‘Ao- 8 V’ and ‘Ao- 7 V’ were found to be the best for high oil content. Identification and selection with superior agronomic traits may be an effective method for genetic improvement of <b>argan</b> <b>trees,</b> and a first step for further breeding studies...|$|R
40|$|Morocco's {{argan oil}} {{is now the}} most {{expensive}} edible oil in the world. Growing high-value argan markets have sparked a bonanza of argan activity. NGOs, international and domestic development agencies, and argan oil cooperatives have promoted the win–win aim of simultaneously benefiting locals and the argan forest. We test this win–win claim by surveying households before and after rapid appreciation in argan prices. The argan boom has benefited some rural households. Those well positioned to benefit increased their goat herds more than other households, which bodes poorly for forest impacts, {{and were more likely}} to send their girls to secondary school. While locals are keeping their goats out of <b>argan</b> <b>trees</b> during the harvest, they may also be resorting to more aggressive harvesting techniques. The boom has made households vigilant guardians of fruit on their own trees, but has not incited investments in longer term tree and forest health. ...|$|R
5000|$|Michael Hübner has {{suggested}} that the fruit of the <b>Argan</b> <b>tree,</b> endemic to the Sous Valley in present-day Morocco, may be the golden apples of the Hesperides. Arguing that the location matches most closely the description given in classical texts of Atlantis and the garden of the Hesperides, he notes that the ripe fruits look like small golden apples and have an aroma like baked apples. He equates the fruit, the seeds of which produce Argan oil, with Plato's account of Atlantean fruits [...] "which afford liquid and solid food and unguents", and proposes that the trees' almost reptilian-scale like bark and thorns may have inspired the mythical guardian dragon of the golden apples, Ladon.|$|E
50|$|The Barbary ground {{squirrel}} is a colonial animal {{and lives in}} family groups in burrows in dry grassland, bushy and rocky areas including disturbed agricultural land, or in dens among rocks.

It feeds on plant material and a major part of its diet is the fruit and seeds of the <b>argan</b> <b>tree</b> (Argania spinosa). If the population builds up and food is scarce, the Barbary {{ground squirrel}} may migrate. The females give birth to litters of up to four young, twice a year.|$|E
50|$|Emberger's {{scientific}} contributions cover {{four main}} areas of research, cytology, biogeography, comparative morphology and phylogeny, and biosystematics. His cytological work focussed on the ferns, horsetails, and the lycopods. His biogeographical work {{concentrated on the}} vegetation of the Mediterranean basin {{and in particular the}} western High Atlas region of Morocco. He published work on the distribution and classification of Moroccan flora, in particular, halfah grass (Stipa tenacissima). His Moroccan work also included studies on the altitudinal zonation of the mountain regions there and the phytogeography of the desert climate, in particular the <b>argan</b> <b>tree</b> (Argania spinosa). Other work included studies of association in equatorial forests, which led to a biogeographical classification of climate, in which he drew comparisons between Australia and homologous zones of the Mediterranean. In biosystematics he developed a classification scheme for vascular plants.|$|E
40|$|The Argan Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels (Ericales: Sapotaceae) is an endemic and emblematic tree {{growing in}} the centre and the {{southwest}} of Morocco. Argan fruits are frequently infested by the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata Wied (Diptera: Tephritidae). To date, no control program has been undertaken in the Argan forest. This research is the first investigation of natural mortality factors of C. capitata larvae in the Argan forest. The study was conducted at two localities {{near the city of}} Essaouira with different climatic conditions. Observations were conducted using 260 late instar larvae which were individually deposited on the ground, under fruiting host trees, where they naturally fall to find a suitable pupation site. Overall, 42 % of the larvae died before being able to burrow into the ground, irrespectively of the location. Larval survival and their likelihood of burrowing decreased with increasing ground temperature, as 53 % of all the larvae deaths occurred at temperatures over 48 degrees C. However, at lower ground temperature, predation by ants and spiders accounted for 47 % of all mortality. Four species of ants carried out 94 % of the captures. Monomorium subopacum Mayr (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), which frequently forages under <b>Argan</b> <b>trees,</b> was by far the most efficient predator, due to a powerful sting that rapidly immobilizes the prey. Our results suggest that the burrowing performance of larvae is constrained by high thermal conditions and the presence of ant predators at lower temperatures. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
30|$|According to our knowledge, no {{research}} {{to date has}} been carried out on the production and characterization of biochar produced from argan shells wastes. In this study, argan shells were selected as the biomass source for producing biochar. Argania, a genus of flowering plants contain the only species Argania spinosa, referred to as <b>argan,</b> a <b>tree</b> that grows in the Sous Area in Morocco. It has a small, oval, round or conical fruit, whose fleshy pulp is covered by a thick peel that surrounds a hard-shelled nut. The latter represents approximately 25 % of the weight of the fresh fruit. Fruit size varies from 17 to 30  mm long and 10 – 17  mm wide. Converting of aragn hard-shelled into biochar can be an alternative way to dispose and recycle wastes.|$|R

Argan oil is traditionally well known for its cardioprotective properties and it is also used in the treatment of skin infections. This paper gives an overview of scientific literature available on nutritional and pharmacologic properties of argan oil. Owing to its unique organoleptic properties associated with its cardioprotective properties, argan oil has found, recently, its place in the highly competitive international edible oil market.

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} is to {{evaluate}} the antiproliferative effect of tocopherols obtained from alimentary virgin argan oil extracted from the endemic <b>argan</b> <b>tree</b> of Morocco and of saponins extracted from argan press cake on three human prostatic cell lines (DU 145, LNCaP, and PC 3). The results were compared to 2 -methoxyestradiol as antiproliferative drug candidates. Cytotoxicity and antiproliferative effects were investigated after cells ’ treatment with tocopherols and saponins compared to 2 -Methoxyoestradiol as the positive control. Tocopherols and saponins extracted from <b>argan</b> <b>tree</b> and 2 -methoxyestradiol exhibit a dose-response cytotoxic effect and an antiproliferative action on the tested cell lines. The best antiproliferative effect of tocopherols is obtained with DU 145 and LNCaP cell lines (28 µg/ml and 32 µg/ml, respectively, as GI 50). The saponins fraction displayed the best antiproliferative effect on the PC 3 cell line with 18 µg/ml as GI 50. Our results confirm the antiproliferative effect of 2 -methoxyestradiol and show {{for the first time}} the antiproliferative effect of tocopherols and saponins extracted from the <b>argan</b> <b>tree</b> on hormone-dependent and hormone-independent prostate cancer cell lines.

40|$|The <b>argan</b> <b>tree</b> is a {{slow growing}} tree {{exclusively}} endemic in the dry lowlands of Southwest Morocco. The argan forest constitutes a long time ignored specific biotope that has been declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1998. The argan forest is particularly fragile to climate change. Forecasts show annual precipitation levels and prolonged drought periods that could severely threaten {{the future of the}} argan forest. In some places, the argan forest is already damaged, resulting in the retreat of the <b>argan</b> <b>tree</b> and the subsequent desert encroachment. An acceleration of this trend would have devastating consequences. In response, some twenty years ago, an ambitious, unique in Northern-Africa, and government-supported program was initiated in Morocco to rescue the <b>argan</b> <b>tree</b> via the sustainable development of the argan forest. Because in the late 1980 s, sustainable development in developing countries was often considered as a utopia, the argan forest case represents a sign of progress, as it is also an interesting and unique experience in Africa. This review analyses the process followed, the measures taken, the pitfalls encountered, and the results obtained during the last two decades.

40|$|The <b>argan</b> <b>tree</b> (Argania spinosa L. skeels) is an {{endemic species}} of Morocco that plays an {{important}} socioeconomic role through {{the value of its}} oil. Despite the importance of the species, the main propagation method is still by seeds, which presents several disadvantages, including a long juvenile phase and high genetic variability between plants. The aim of this work is to study from one side the genotype and source of calcium (CaCl 2 and Ca(NO 3) 2) effects on the cutting yield, and from the other side the effect of the rootstock and the graft genotype on the grafting method’s success and finally compare between the both methods for argan massive propagation. The results exhibited an important genotype effect on the cutting; in fact, each of the four propagated genotypes reacted differently to this propagation method. The calcium treatment did not improve the cutting rooting, whereas its disinfectant effect depended on the genotype. From the other side, the grafting success depended mainly on the graft/rootstock compatibility, but little on the graft genotype and not at all on the rootstock genotype.

40|$|In {{the southwestern}} pre-Saharan arid zone of Morocco, the endemic argan forest (Argania spinosa) {{had been almost}} {{completely}} destroyed in the 1960 s due to intensive coal mining and mixed cereal-livestock farming. These activities {{turned out to be}} unviable and a massive rural exodus occurred in the 1970 s. Local populations started to develop maintenance-free prickly pear (Opuntia ficusindica) cultivation at large scale in order to keep their land ownership rights, while reducing their traditional agropastoral activity. We conducted a survey in order to characterize the relationships between the age of prickly pear orchards and <b>argan</b> <b>tree</b> regeneration. We also explored facilitating factors, such as soil organic matter and mycorrhiza. Results showed a high positive correlation (r(2) = 0. 75, p < 0. 001) between the age of prickly pear orchards and <b>argan</b> <b>tree</b> resprouts, but with differences depending on a continentality gradient. The soil organic matter content also showed highly significant differences (p < 0. 001) depending on the age of the prickly pear plantation, while spora density did not show such differences. The recent high economic value attributed to prickly pear fruits, and to both argan and prickly pear seed oil, has given farmers the opportunity to develop a lucrative agricultural activity, while promoting the recovery of native vegetation. This situation constitutes a remarkable example of speculative agricultural development in a very harsh environment, in phase with ecological priorities for combating desertification. It could represent an alternative to the externally-generated projects sustained by high levels of public funding, with ecological, economic and social impacts which are sometimes questionable...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Populations of Morocco South-western part {{traditionally}} use {{the fruits}} of Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels to prepare an edible oil whose obtention also furnishes, as side product, a cake used to feed the cattle and complements the forage furnished by the leaves of this same plant. Unfortunately, the wood of Argania spinosa is also used for fuel and deforestation is subsequently accelerated since populations are generally eager to replace argan groves by cultures of higher and immediate benefit. However, <b>argan</b> <b>tree,</b> that is particularly well adapted to grow in arid lands, has been proposed by several agencies {{to slow down the}} desert progress in northern Africa.
