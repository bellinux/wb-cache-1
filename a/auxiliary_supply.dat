50|$|A key {{difference}} between the Class 56s and the earlier designs of the 1950s and 1960s {{is the use of}} self-exciting alternators rather than direct current (DC) generators for the generation of traction current and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>supply.</b> This produces a far more robust power unit, and greatly reduces the risk of flash-overs and other earth faults. Traction supply was rectified since the type employs DC traction motors. Many auxiliary machines (such as compressors and traction motor blowers) used the unrectified 3-phase AC output of the auxiliary alternator, and therefore run at a speed proportional to engine r.p.m.|$|E

The major improvement was the use of motor alternators for the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>supplies</b> using static rectification, instead of the motor generator sets. The drivers brake valve used the more reliable poppet valve instead of rotary type face valves, and the electro-pneumatic valves used plug in connectors, speeding up replacement and reducing faults due to bad electrical connections.|$|R

50|$|Each {{motor car}} is fitted with two series DC motors, {{one on each}} of the two bogies and are {{designed}} to operate from the 630 volt traction supply. Each motor has an output of approximately 250 horsepower. The controllers and switchgear are operated from a 50 volt <b>auxiliary</b> <b>supply</b> provided by a motor-generator set. This system allows the master controller {{at one end of the}} train to simultaneously operate the switchgear on all the motor cars in a similar manner to the system developed by Sprague for the Elevated railway in Chicago, Illinois some 46 years earlier.

50|$|DDR4 chips use a 1.2 V {{supply with}} a 2.5 V <b>auxiliary</b> <b>supply</b> for wordline boost called VPP, as {{compared}} with the standard 1.5 V of DDR3 chips, with lower voltage variants at 1.05 V appearing in 2013. DDR4 is expected to be introduced at transfer rates of 2133 MT/s, estimated to rise to a potential 4266 MT/s by 2013. The minimum transfer rate of 2133 MT/s was said to be due to progress made in DDR3 speeds which, being likely to reach 2133 MT/s, left little commercial benefit to specifying DDR4 below this speed. Techgage interpreted Samsung's January 2011 engineering sample as having CAS latency of 13 clock cycles, described as being comparable to the move from DDR2 to DDR3.|$|E

However, those plans changed and instead, the ship was sent directly to Davie's yard in Quebec instead. Pending an official agreement between the shipyard and the Canadian government, the vessel should be ready by Summer 2017. The ship would be under contract with the Royal Canadian Navy until 2021 when the second of the two Queenston-class support ships would be completed.

However, unless the Mach 5 was equipped with an electric drive mechanism, which is never mentioned, the Mach 5s engine (rated at 5,000 HP) could consume this supply in a few minutes, assuming it had the ability to operate on a pure O2 supply.|$|E

The hydraulic converter includes an integrated retarder (brake). Cooling fans and the electrical generator are powered via a hydrostatic drive.

40|$|The stakeholders’ perceptual {{evaluations}} of the supply structure of destination tourism {{play an important role}} in promoting the sustainable development of regional tourism. However, the research on the structural perceptions of destination tourism supply is relatively insufficient in current research on the perceptions of tourism stakeholders. This paper analyzes the perceptual differences among inbound tourists, community residents and tourism practitioners from the core and <b>auxiliary</b> tourism <b>supply</b> dimensions. After having applied the structural equation model in this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of the tourism supply of Xi’an, a famous tourist city in China, were identified.

Furthermore, the moderately stable supply factors of Xi’an include tourist transportation, tourist catering, tourist accommodation, marketing as well as safety and security, while the natural environment is the limiting factor.
