5|$|On April1, Hudah {{continued}} intensifying while approaching eastern Madagascar, and by 0600UTC that day, the MFR upgraded {{the storm}} to very intense tropical cyclone intensity– the highest rating on the agency's cyclone classification scale. Shortly after, at 1200UTC, {{the storm was}} <b>analyzed</b> <b>to</b> have reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 225km/h (140mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 905mbar (hPa; 26.73inHg), ranking Hudah {{among some of the}} strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded in the Southwest Indian Ocean. The JTWC listed a similar intensity for the storm, with winds of 235km/h (145mph), though these winds were for 1-minute sustained winds instead of 10-minute sustained winds. This intensity was later <b>analyzed</b> <b>to</b> have been very near the theoretical maximum for tropical cyclones in the environmental conditions Hudah was in. At the time, TRMM imagery indicated that the storm featured two concentric eyewalls. Cyclone Hudah maintained peak intensity up until it made its first landfall approximately 28km (17mi) southeast of Antalaha, Madagascar at 1730UTC on April2. Hudah substantially weakened as it traversed the mountainous terrain of northern Madagascar, and was downgraded to tropical depression status by the time it entered the Mozambique Channel at 1200UTC on March3.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{hurricane}} {{can be traced to}} a compact and slow-moving low-pressure area in the open Atlantic Ocean in late August1940. As the system progressed in a west-northwest direction, its center of circulation became more organized. As a result, the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression between the Greater Antilles and Bermuda at 1200UTC on August26. Operationally, the storm was <b>analyzed</b> <b>to</b> have undergone tropical cyclogenesis on August30. However, a reanalysis of the storm conducted in 2012 found that the system was already organized prior. In its initial stages, the depression remained weak, with few ships reporting abnormally strong winds in association with the storm. Continuing in a slow west-northwest movement, the disturbance gradually intensified, and was <b>analyzed</b> <b>to</b> have attained tropical storm intensity by 1800UTC on August28. At 0600UTC on August30, the tropical storm strengthened further into the equivalent of a modern-day Category1hurricane, roughly 225mi (360km) east of the Florida peninsula. At the same time, the hurricane began to intensify and move quicker than it had previously. Later that day, a ship within the periphery of the storm reported winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a barometric pressure of 979mbar (hPa; 28.90inHg).|$|E

5|$|At 1200UTC on September1, the {{hurricane}} attained modern-day Category2intensity. Ships continued to report strong winds and low pressures {{associated with the}} storm. Early on September1, {{the hurricane}} passed 85mi (135km) of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, before recurving towards the northeast {{and away from the}} coast. That same day, two ships reported hurricane-force winds. At 0200UTC on September2, the American steamboat Franklin K. Lane reported a barometric pressure of 965mbar (hPa; 28.50inHg) while located within the hurricane's radius of maximum wind; this would be the lowest pressure measured in association with the tropical cyclone and the lowest measured in the entire North Atlantic Ocean in September1940. Based on the ship observation, the storm was <b>analyzed</b> <b>to</b> have reached peak intensity on September 2 with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 961 mbar (hPa; 28.38 inHg). However, stronger winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) were <b>analyzed</b> <b>to</b> have been present in the hurricane earlier. As it traversed though more northerly latitudes, the storm began to gradually weaken. The storm made landfall slightly northwest of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia at 2100 UTC later on September 2 as a tropical storm with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). After quickly passing over Nova Scotia, the weakening tropical storm transitioned into an extratropical storm over the Bay of Fundy at 0000 UTC on September 3. At the same time, the cyclone made a second landfall on New Brunswick as a slightly weaker storm with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). The extratropical system progressed over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence before it was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm at 1800 UTC later that day in Quebec just north of Anticosti Island.|$|E

5|$|On October 23, an open trough was {{centered}} north of Hispaniola near the Turks and Caicos islands. At 0000 UTC the following day, {{the area of}} disturbed weather became organized and was <b>analyzed</b> <b>to</b> have become a tropical storm southeast of Inagua, based on nearby vessel reports. Initially, the storm drifted northward, but later began to accelerate towards the northeast after a roughly 12-hour period. At 0600 UTC on September 25, the disturbance slightly gained in intensity to attain maximum wind speeds of 45 mph (75 km/h); these would be the strongest winds associated with the storm as a fully tropical cyclone. A reanalysis of the system indicated that {{due to a lack}} of definite tropical features, the storm may have had been a subtropical cyclone. On October 26, the system became increasingly asymmetric and had developed frontal boundaries, allowing for it to be classified as an extratropical cyclone at 0600 UTC that day. Once transitioning into an extratropical system, the storm continued to intensified as it moved northward. On October 27, the system was <b>analyzed</b> <b>to</b> have a minimum pressure of at least 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg) after passing to the southeast of Bermuda. At 1200 UTC later that day, the cyclone reached an extratropical peak intensity with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) just east of Newfoundland. Had the storm been tropical at the time, it would have been classified as a modern-day Category 1 hurricane. Subsequently, the extratropical storm curved eastward, where it persisted before dissipating by 1800 UTC on September 29.|$|E

5|$|On October 7, a large {{elongated}} extratropical cyclone extended {{across the}} Atlantic Ocean with a pressure of at most 1015 mbar (hPa; 29.98 inHg).

On October 9, the extratropical system was <b>analyzed</b> <b>to</b> {{have become a}} tropical depression. The low moved slowly to the northeast and gradually weakened before dissipating on October 10. On October 14, offshore observations indicated that a tropical depression had developed north of The Bahamas. The following day, however, the depression became less defined and degenerated into a trough of low pressure. On October 16, two ships listed in the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set reported winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) {{off the coast of}} North Carolina. However, since these reports occurred in a higher pressure gradient, the system was not included in HURDAT.|$|E
5|$|The Fujita {{scale and}} the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale was an update to the older Fujita scale, by expert elicitation, using {{engineered}} wind estimates and better damage descriptions. The EF Scale was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating, and was implemented starting in the United States in 2007. An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an EF5 tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler weather radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be <b>analyzed</b> <b>to</b> determine intensity and award a rating.|$|E
