25|$|BEA soon {{selected}} the D.H.121 {{as the basis}} for detailed negotiations, but these talks were protracted due to multiple factors, including wider policy decisions of the British government and indecision within BEA itself. During the time that the D.H.121 had emerged in the late 1950s, the British government came to view the airframe and <b>aeroengine</b> industries as too fragmented into small companies; accordingly, a policy favouring mergers into a few large groups was adopted. de Havilland was keen to retain their independence and leadership of the D.H.121, and thus approached the government with a proposal to form a consortium under which de Havilland would produce the fuselage, Bristol would manufacture the wings, and various other companies, including Hunting Aircraft and Fairey Aviation would be responsible for other elements; however, Bristol strongly opposed this arrangement and chose to work with Hawker Siddeley in competition against de Havilland.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main problem}} facing the Il-86 project {{was the lack}} of a {{suitable}} engine. It was never resolved. By the close of the 1960s, the USA and the UK had turbofans with bypass ratios of 4 or 5 to 1. The first Soviet large turbofan, the Lotarev D-18T, did not appear before the mid-1980s. The Soloviev D-30, originally intended for the Il-86, was the most advanced Soviet civil <b>aeroengine.</b> It had a bypass ratio of 2.4 to 1 and aerodynamic clamshell thrust reversers. It failed to attain the required thrust, however: [...] "only after the lapse of three years that were spent on preparing the advanced development project did it become clear that these engines would not provide the necessary take-off performance." [...] The less-advanced Kuznetsov NK-8 series engine, adopted on March 26, 1975, had a bypass ratio of 1.15 to 1 and drag-inducing grilles over its cascade thrust reversers. Both these engines had high specific fuel consumptions and were noisy. Being ultimate developments of smaller engines, they could not offer growth to future Il-86s.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAcoustic linings are {{routinely}} {{used in the}} intakes and bypass ducts of civilian <b>aeroengines</b> {{in order to reduce}} noise. They are often modelled as a complex impedance, Z(ω) = p/v, where a pressure p{ iω t} gives rise to a fluid velocity normal to the liner of v{ iω t}. This presentation will give a review of acoustic lining models, including both physical (empirically derived) models for Z(ω), and mathematical models for the boundary condition to be applied at an acoustic lining. The application of the boundary condition is complicated by the presence of a mean flow over the lining; a situation typically encountered in <b>aeroengines.</b> The controversy over the stability of flow over an acoustic lining will be explained, together with recent attempts to resolve this controversy, both experimentally and mathematically...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe hard support vector {{regression}} attracts {{little attention}} {{owing to the}} overfitting phenomenon. Recently, a fast offline method has been proposed to approximately train the hard support vector regression with the generation performance comparable to the soft support vector regression. Based on this achievement, this article advances a fast online approximation called the hard support vector regression (FOAHSVR for short). By adopting the greedy stagewise and iterative strategies, {{it is capable of}} online estimating parameters of complicated systems. In order to verify the effectiveness of the FOAHSVR, an FOAHSVR-based analytical redundancy for <b>aeroengines</b> is developed. Experiments on the sensor failure and drift evidence the viability and feasibility of the analytical redundancy for <b>aeroengines</b> together with its base—FOAHSVR. In addition, the FOAHSVR is anticipated to find applications in other scientific-technical fields...|$|R
