25|$|This {{does not}} mean that Sanders {{believes}} God’s knowledge of the future is “limited” as some critics have charged. Rather, Sanders holds that what is referred to as “the” future is not an ontological reality—it does not exist. If it is does not exist then there is literally “no thing” or actuality for God to know. Open theists <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> that there is a reality about which God is ignorant (which would be limited omniscience). The denial that God has exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingent events has been the single most controversial aspect of open theism.|$|E

Mild. As if. Discover the real Jesus." [...] In response to the controversy Reverend Peter Owens-Jones of the Church Advertising Network (CAN) who designed the ad stated [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> that Jesus was communist, {{but that he was}} revolutionary. We are exploiting the image of revolution, not the image of Che Guevara." ...|$|E
2500|$|There was a {{great deal}} of data. It suggests, firstly, that {{individuals}} who dislike America and consider the September 11 attacks to be [...] "perfectly justified" [...] form a statistically distinct group, with much more extreme views. The authors call this 7% of Muslims [...] "Politically Radicalized". They chose that title [...] "because of their radical political orientation" [...] and clarify [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> that all in this group commit acts of violence. However, those with extremist views are a potential source for recruitment or support for terrorist groups." [...] The data also indicates that poverty is not simply to blame for the comparatively radical views of this 7% of Muslims, who tend to be better educated than moderates.|$|E

2500|$|Christopher Landsea, a {{hurricane}} researcher, said of [...] "the {{part of the}} IPCC to which my expertise is relevant" [...] that [...] "I personally cannot in good faith continue {{to contribute to a}} process that I view as both being motivated by pre-conceived agendas and being scientifically unsound," [...] because of comments made at a press conference by Kevin Trenberth of which Landsea disapproved. Trenberth said [...] "Landsea's comments were not correct"; the IPCC replied [...] "individual scientists can do what they wish in their own rights, as long as they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> anything on behalf of the IPCC" [...] and offered to include Landsea in the review phase of the AR4. Roger Pielke, Jr. commented [...] "Both Landsea and Trenberth can and should feel vindicated... the IPCC accurately reported the state of scientific understandings of tropical cyclones and climate change in its recent summary for policy makers." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Orthodox Christians {{refer to}} Fallen Nature they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> that human nature has become evil in itself. Human nature is still {{formed in the}} image of God; we are still God's creation, and God has never created {{anything}} evil. But our fallen nature remains open to evil intents and actions. It is sometimes said that we are [...] "inclined to sin"; that is, we find some sinful things attractive. It is the nature of temptation to make sinful things seem the more attractive, and it is the fallen nature of humans that seeks or succumbs to the attraction. Orthodox Christians reject the Augustinian position that the descendants of Adam and Eve are actually guilty of the original sin of their ancestors. But just as any species begets its own kind, so fallen humans beget fallen humans, and from the beginning of our existence we lie open to sinning by our own choice.|$|E

But what I am saying is this: the course he is {{choosing}} to lead our nation is paving the way for the future reign of the Antichrist.|$|R

5000|$|... "The nostalgic, moist-eyed silences of Ulfat Idilbi's {{narrative}} {{could not}} be more different from the chilling, cynical silences in Zakaria Tamer's stories. The impassioned lacunae in Nizar Kabbani's proclaim exactly what it is they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> explicitly, while the poet Muhammad al-Maghut's silence is sardonic, sneering both at the authorities and at himself, at the futility and absurdity of the human situation under authoritarian rule".|$|E

Building of democratic institutions is required, but that is going to take time. The government was not prepared to tackle violence like that which took place last year.

50|$|Author Louis Menand {{argues that}} the book has been {{commonly}} misused by liberals and conservatives alike, who cited it for their own ideological agendas. Menand wrote: Lasch <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> that things <b>were</b> better in the 1950s, as conservatives offended by countercultural permissiveness probably took him to <b>be</b> <b>saying.</b> He <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> that things <b>were</b> better in the 1960s, as former activists disgusted by the 'me-ism' of the seventies {{are likely to have}} imagined. He was diagnosing a condition that he believed had originated in the nineteenth century. Lasch attempted to correct many of these misapprehensions with The Minimal Self in 1984.|$|R
