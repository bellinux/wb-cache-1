5|$|The {{so-called}} NatWest Three — Giles Darby, David Bermingham and Gary Mulgrew — were extradited to the United States in 2006 {{on charges}} relating to a transaction with Enron Corporation in 2000 {{while they were}} working for Greenwich NatWest. It {{has been argued that}} the alleged crime was committed by British citizens living in the UK against a British company based in London and therefore, any resulting criminal case falls {{under the jurisdiction of the}} English courts. However, the Serious Fraud Office decided not to prosecute due to lack of evidence. There has been criticism that the <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> not have to produce a prima facie case, or even a reasonable one, to extradite British citizens, whereas no such facility exists to extradite US citizens to the UK. On 28 November 2007 the three admitted one charge of wire fraud after a plea bargain. On 22 February 2008 they were each sentenced to 37 months in prison.|$|E

It {{has been reported}} that some Hmong Americans, like some other groups of <b>Americans,</b> <b>do</b> not fully understand American law regarding hunting. In their homeland, the Hmong had a different hunting culture, and most lands were government-owned and therefore open to subsistence hunting, as in other third world countries. Regional officials in Wisconsin and Minnesota have focused on educating Hmong hunters on private property rights to diminish the risk of future conflicts.|$|E
25|$|Today the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of the Census recognizes four races, Native American or American Indian, African American, Asian and White (European American). According to the U.S. government, Hispanic <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> not {{constitute}} a race, but rather an ethnic group. During the 2000 U.S. Census Whites made up 75.1% of the population with those being Hispanic or Latino constituting the nation's prevalent minority with 12.5% of the population. African Americans made up 12.3% of the total population, 3.6% were Asian American and 0.7% were Native American.|$|E

About 80% thought that the government should do more to curb illegal immigration.|$|E

25|$|As the eTA is {{used for}} the sole purpose of {{immigration}} screening for non-Canadian visitors entering Canada on a temporary basis, all Canadian citizens are automatically barred from applying the eTA. Hence the passport requirement is in place, because a Canadian citizen who travels on a visa-free, non-Canadian passport will be prevented from boarding the commercial flight to Canada unless he or she can present a valid Canadian passport during check-in. The only exceptions to this rule are for a Canadian citizen travelling on a U.S. passport, as <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> not need an eTA to enter Canada, or when a Canadian citizen travelling on an eTA-required passport enters Canada by sea or through one of the land ports of entry from the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Study has {{indicated}} that most non-Asian <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> not generally differentiate between Asian Americans of different ethnicities. Stereotypes of Chinese Americans and Asian Americans are nearly identical. A 2002 survey of Americans' attitudes toward Asian Americans and Chinese Americans indicated that 24% of the respondents disapprove of intermarriage with an Asian American, second only to African Americans; 23% would be uncomfortable supporting an Asian American presidential candidate, compared to 15% for an African American, 14% for a woman and 11% for a Jew; 17% would be upset if {{a substantial number of}} Asian Americans moved into their neighborhood; 25% had somewhat or very negative attitude toward Chinese Americans in general. The study did find several positive perceptions of Chinese Americans: strong family values (91%); honesty as business people (77%); high value on education (67%).|$|E
25|$|On {{the issue}} of whether most <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> not stay put in any one income bracket, Krugman quotes from 2011 CBO {{distribution}} of income study Household income measured over a multi-year period is more equally distributed than income measured over one year, although only modestly so. Given the fairly substantial movement of households across income groups over time, it might seem that income measured {{over a number of years}} should be significantly more equally distributed than income measured over one year. However, much of the movement of households involves changes in income that are large enough to push households into different income groups but not large enough to greatly affect the overall distribution of income. Multi-year income measures also show the same pattern of increasing inequality over time as is observed in annual measures.|$|E

500|$|According to scholar Robert Zecker, {{the novel}} depicts African-American poverty {{but does not}} {{illustrate}} its causes. None of the characters think about how 500,000African-Americans were placed in cramped living areas of only 25 square blocks and the bitterness and rage that stems from such conditions. The African <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> not forget the years of oppression they have endured. However, the Greek Americans, like other whites, fail {{to remember that the}} African Americans were assaulted by whites in 1943 and faced over two decades of oppression after that. Instead, Zecker noted that the characters in the novel believe that the 1967 Detroit riots are [...] "inexplicable cataclysms that came out of nowhere".|$|E
500|$|During their 2005 {{tour with}} Dylan and Nelson, Buzz McClain of The Washington Post {{believed}} that The Greencards play traditional American music {{better than some}} <b>Americans</b> <b>do,</b> because of their deep respect for bluegrass and the Americana sound. According to David McPherson in Bluegrass Unlimited magazine, the band's three-part harmonies evoke the soul sounds of gospel music. Kym Warner has said that Robert Earl Keen, Kelly Willis, and Patty Griffin were key influences musically in The Greencards's sound during their time in Austin, with the previously unreleased Griffin song [...] "What You Are" [...] being covered on their album Weather and Water. The recordings on Viridian, in particular the songs [...] "River of Sand", [...] "Waiting on the Night" [...] and [...] "When I Was in Love With You", were said to evoke the sounds of progressive folk rock {{that emerged in the}} 1960s. In Nashville Scene, Edd Hurt noted the eclectic tone of the band's overall body of recordings, and believed that their albums belonged to the tradition of singer-songwriter musicians.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} dual citizenship, which {{previously}} had been strongly {{opposed by the}} U.S. government, has become more accepted {{in the years since}} Afroyim. In 1980, the administration of President Jimmy Carter concluded that the Bancroft Treaties—a series of bilateral agreements, formulated between 1868 and 1937, which provided for automatic loss of citizenship upon foreign naturalization of a U.S. citizen—were no longer enforceable, due in part to Afroyim, and gave notice terminating these treaties. [...] In 1990, the State Department adopted new guidelines for evaluating potential loss-of-citizenship cases, under which the government now assumes in almost all situations that <b>Americans</b> <b>do</b> not in fact intend to give up their citizenship unless they explicitly indicate to U.S. officials that this is their intention. [...] As explained by Peter J. Spiro, [...] "In the long run, Afroyims vision of an absolute right to retain citizenship has been largely, if quietly, vindicated. As a matter of practice, it is now virtually impossible to lose American citizenship without formally and expressly renouncing it." ...|$|E

Guam has held non-binding straw polls for president since the 1980s {{to draw attention to}} this fact.

2500|$|Unlike most {{markets for}} {{consumer}} {{services in the}} United States, the health care market generally lacks transparent market-based pricing.
