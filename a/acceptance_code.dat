40|$|The {{governing}} {{feature in}} writing an <b>acceptance</b> <b>code</b> for any {{purpose is to}} specify conditions which will be easily duplicated in all details so that results obtained may be directly compared. These conditions, while being those most easily reproducible, are not always those with which it would be most economical to comply, especially in cases where a manufacturer is making {{a large number of}} tests during development of a process or material. In the development of arc-welding electrodes, the properties of the deposited weld metal must be controlled within the limits set out in the following specifications. [ [...] . ] In view of the above, it can be understood why a company engaged in electrode development would be interested in developing a test which could be more economically carried out, while producing the same results as the standard test. The main object of this study therefore, is to attempt to develop an alternative test that will give results that are identical with, or could be correlated to, the results obtained by the Standard method. The problem may be divided into two parts. 1) To develop a sample which will be metallurgically identical with the standard sample. This specimen should be such that it is easier and more economical to produce. 2) To develop a method of testing the specimen that will yield data concerning the elongation of the sample at fracture. This method should, if possible, be more economical to produce than the standard method...|$|E

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} a multi-year research {{effort to}} develop a leak-free duct system that can be readily installed within the thermal envelope. There are numerous efforts underway to improve duct system efficiency. Most of these involve modifications to current technology such as air sealing techniques like mastic and aeroseal, snap together duct connections, and greater levels of insulation. This project sought to make a more significant stride forward by introducing a duct system of a material that can be more readily sealed and can exhibit lower friction losses. The research focused {{on the use of}} smooth internal surface, low friction plastic ducts that could be easily installed with very low air leakage. The initial system concept that was proposed and researched in Phase I focused on the use of thermoformed plastic ducts installed in a recessed roof truss underneath the attic insulation. A bench top thermoformed system was developed and tested during Phase I of the project. In Phase II, a first generation duct system utilizing a resin impregnated fiberglass duct product was designed and specified. The system was installed and tested in an Atlanta area home. Following this installation research and correspondence with code officials was undertaken to alleviate the continued concern over the <b>code</b> <b>acceptance</b> of plastic ducts in above ground applications.

40|$|The {{constant}} {{growth of}} the scope and depth of evidence-based decision making in government throughout the 19 th and 20 th centuries has led countries to develop the concept of statistical independence of political and other vested interests. This independence {{is the most important}} condition necessary for maintaining and increasing data quality, yet the institutional position of statistical offices as part of government makes this hard to achieve. The institutions and governance of statistics in many countries, including developed ones, still leave much to be desired. In spite of this, history of the last several decades suggests there is systematic improvement in the governance of statistics within countries, with legislation and e. g. the <b>acceptance</b> of <b>codes</b> of practice ensuring this independence, etc. Recent developments have, however, introduced a relatively new danger in the rapid development of automatisms, where evidence-based decision making is being replaced by automatic decisions that virtually, or even fully, leave the responsible human decision maker out of the process. This development, which seems to be a welcome gradation of evidence-based decision making, is in fact a grave danger for the independence and quality of statistics, because it re-orients the target of lobbying from the decision makers (who are no longer in the loop) to the data sources, thus putting the quality of official statistics under new powerful pressures. In this context it is more necessary now than ever before to protect the statistical systém from these influences by ensuring full independence in the governance of statistics...|$|R

Grade 91 steel has been widely utilized in power plants over the last 20 years. Its specification worldwide has dramatically increased since the <b>acceptance</b> of <b>Code</b> Case 1943 for this material in 1983. Recent evaluation of a combination of ex-service Grade 91 steel components and virgin material has provided a unique opportunity to independently assess the performance of a combination of base metal and weldments. This approach has been grounded in the fundamental objective of linking metallurgical risk factors in Grade 91 steel to the cross-weld creep performance. Establishing critical risk factors in 9 Cr steels is regarded as a key consideration in the integration of a meaningful life management strategy for these complex steels. The potential metallurgical risk factors in Grade 91 steel have been fundamentally divided into factors which affect strength, ductility or both. In this study, two heats of ex-service Grade 91 steel which exhibit dramatic differences in strength and ductility have been evaluated in the exservice condition and re-heat treated to establish a relevant set of strength:ductility variables. This set of variables includes [strength:ductility]: low:low, medium:low, low:high and medium:high. The influence of these strength:ductility variables were investigated for feature type cross-weld creep tests to better evaluate the influence of the initial base material condition on cross-weld creep performance...|$|R

The study identifies the code provisions which are most and least complied with and examines the perceptions of different stakeholder groups relating to the barriers of good governance, the causes of non-compliance with the Code and the appropriate model of governance for Bangladesh. The study uses a questionnaire survey for the listed companies in Bangladesh and the semi-structured interview method with the stakeholder groups. The shareholder and the stakeholder theoretical perspectives are adopted to interpret the results.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in three primary schools in St. Lucia, a multilingual country situated in the Caribbean. The goal of this research was to investigate teachers’ and students’ attitudes and practices regarding the use of code switching in the academic writing of Grade 5 primary school students. For {{the purpose of this study}} code switching is defined as a phenomenon in which speakers [writers] switch back and forth between two separate languages and/or dialects (Schecter & Bayley, 1997). Code switching for bilinguals is “a way of saying that they belong to both worlds, and should not be forced to give up one for the other” (Zentella, 1997, p. 114). There are four major aims in this study. First the study aims to document the nature of code switching in students’ written texts. Second, the study focuses on examining both teacher and student views of Kwéyòl influenced code switching in students’ writing. The third aim is to identify whether <b>acceptance</b> of <b>code</b> switching in students’ written texts can be used positively to support their writing. The final aim is to evaluate the impact of teachers’ feedback on students’ written texts. A mixed-method approach was used to gather data for this research. The teachers’ interview was conducted with three Grade 5 teachers from three different primary schools. Questionnaires were also distributed to the other teachers on staff of each of the three Primary schools involved in this study. Selected students of the Grade 5 classes were part of the focus group interview. The students’ written scripts were also analysed and used during the focus group discussion, where students were able to provide reasons for certain statements in their text which reflected code switching. A thematic approach was used for the data analysis and this provided in depth knowledge of how teachers and students felt about code switching in their writing. A major finding was the teachers’ contradictory responses in terms of their attitudes and practice related to code switching. Some teachers commented that the use of the L 1 would have a negative impact on the acquisition of Standard English. The importance of students learning the ‘proper’ structures of Standard English was highlighted as a major factor in assisting students in becoming communicatively competent. Although some teachers held a negative view of code switching practices in students’ writing, others were indeed pleased that some students were able to use their L 1 to express their intended meaning. Moreover, the study found important differences in the attitudes between the individual teachers in the three different schools The responses from the teachers also indicated that code switching would be more effective in some genres of writing. This suggests that there is some kind of <b>acceptance</b> of <b>code</b> switching in students’ writing. The majority of the teachers agreed that code switching could be used positively to teach Standard English. However, teachers felt that they needed further information on the phenomenon in order to make informed decisions and assist students more effectively in their writing. There were other responses suggesting that there are positive attitudes towards code switching. What was of great interest was that some of the students’ attitudes mirrored those of their teachers, suggesting that teacher attitudes, beliefs and perhaps school ethos play a major role in changing the attitudes of the most important stakeholders, the children. The research highlighted the effective role that teachers’ attitudes and metalinguistic awareness, or lack of it, play in the language learning classroom, particularly in a multilingual society. Teachers need to be aware of the importance of metalinguistic awareness and should aim at exploring ways to promote language learning among students. This study also makes an important contribution to understanding how attitudes and practices in bilingual contexts and the use of language varieties in second language development are related. In conclusion, the study highlights the urgent need for all stakeholders to work collaboratively to finalise a draft literacy policy and plan document that might support bilingual and/or multilingual development of all students in the linguistically and culturally diverse classrooms...|$|R
