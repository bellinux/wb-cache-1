Simultaneously, {{they are intended to}} help him to exploit machines and farming vehicle closer to their full performance and improve the quality of work. Vehicles frequently have to be steered in and exact straight line and along rows in the farm land. GPS receiver fetches the information of positions (latitude and longitude) of the farm land which needs to be cultivated. With the help of GPS and microcontroller (Arm 9) we calculate the boundary of farm land, slope of straight line and angle of movement with the help of slope changes.

40|$|Since its inception, {{cybernetics}} {{was more}} or less identified as a science of self-regulating and equilibrating systems. Thermostats, physiological regulation of body temperature, <b>automatic</b> <b>steering</b> <b>devices,</b> economic and political processes were studied under a general mathematical model of deviation-counteracting feedback networks. By focusing on the deviation-counteracting aspect of the mutual causal relationships however, the cyberneticians paid less attention to the systems in which the mutual causal effects are deviation-amplifying. Such systems are ubiquitous: accumulation of capital in industry, evolution of living organisms, the rise of cultures of various types, interpersonal processes which produce menial illness, international conflicts, and the processes that are loosely termed as &quot;vicious circles &quot; and &quot;compound interests&quot;; in short, all processes of mutual causal relationships that amplify an insignificant or accidental initial kick, build up deviation and diverge from the initial condition. In contrast to the progress in the study of equilibrating systems, the deviation-amplifying systems have not been given as much investment of time and energy by the mathematical scientists on the one hand, and understanding and practical application on the part o...|$|R

This 5, 300 ha continuous cropping operation at Newdegate WA relies on advanced agronomic practices {{to assist the}} sustainability of the fragile landscape. This efficient and innovative use of machinery and labour is necessary to compete as a low cost producer of purely exported grains. <b>Automatic</b> <b>steering</b> <b>devices,</b> accurate within five centimeters, are fitted to all machinery for planting, fertilizing, spraying and harvesting operations. Machines are 9, 18 or 36 m wide and their wheel position is standardized. This system allows for the controlling of soil compaction into precise pathways; the elimination of over and under lapping of machinery passes; accurate placement of seed and fertiliser adjacent to previous furrows; greater control over residue management; and the innovative use of knockdown herbicides applied within crop using a between row application. Variations in operator skill level are eliminated whilst reducing operator fatigue. A combination of eight years of satellite derived crop biomass imagery, three years of harvest grain yield data, a digital elevation map as well as comprehensive soil analysis, are overlaid into one data set to accurately define productivity zones across the farm.

40|$|Studies {{concerning}} {{collision avoidance}} {{show that most}} drivers tend to brake, even if evasive manoeuvres were better. <b>Automatic</b> <b>steering</b> for collision avoidance would help here. Studies in the EU project interactIVe observed that drivers show a tendency to hold {{the steering wheel and}} disturb the <b>automatic</b> <b>steering</b> when kept in the control loop. A strategy of driver decoupling e. g. by means of steer-by-wire systems could improve the <b>automatic</b> <b>steering</b> performance. However, the major challenge of using steer-by-wire systems is to enable the driver to compensate false system activation, e. g. evasion into oncoming traffic. A time dependent strategy of driver decoupling using steer-by-wire combined with override recognition by counter steering above a certain threshold was implemented in a research vehicle. The interaction strategy was tested with 45 participants on a test track in two different scenarios; a collision situation with justified evasion and a false alert scenario with unjustified system activation. In a between-subject design the decoupling strategy (using steer-by-wire) was compared against <b>automatic</b> <b>steering</b> with fully coupled driver and force feedback on the steering wheel and against Manual Driving without <b>automatic</b> <b>steering.</b> When the driver was temporarily decoupled, the obstacle avoidance performance was better but the driver was less able to counteract a false avoidance manoeuvre.

40|$|Optical beam <b>steering</b> <b>devices,</b> which {{control the}} {{propagation}} direction of light, have diverse applications, including LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), optical wireless communication, optical imaging, and sensing. In all applications, {{there have been}} growing demands for smaller device size, faster scanning speed, and lower power consumption. Among various types of optical beam <b>steering</b> <b>devices,</b> phased-array InP optical beam <b>steering</b> <b>devices</b> have several advantages, such as compact size, fast steering speed above few hundred MHz, and integratability with laser diodes. On the other hand, InP/InGaAsP waveguide device in general suffers from a difficulty in extracting the light {{out of the plane}} efficiently, due to the relatively small refractive index difference between InP and InGaAsP. In this research, we aim to realize efficient and compact phased-array optical beam <b>steering</b> <b>devices</b> on InP. This work consists of two parts. We first design, fabricate, and demonstrate one-dimensional (1 D) optical beam <b>steering</b> <b>device</b> circuits on InP. Then, we develop a novel type of vertical optical coupler having a slanted mirror, which could be used to realize truly two-dimensional beam-steering. The 1 D optical beam <b>steering</b> <b>devices</b> are designed based on the concept of phased array, and its characteristics are calculated by using the beam-propagation method. The designed devices are fabricated by the standard III-V semiconductor optical device process. A far-field optical measurement setup is newly built to characterize the beam-steering function of the fabricated devices. We experimentally demonstrate large steering angle of ± 28 degree as well as low wavelength dependency over wide wavelength range from 1530 nm to 1570 nm. The vertical optical coupler, having a slanted mirror, is designed by using the eigenmode expansion method. The designed optical coupler is then fabricated by C 12 /Ar reactive-ion-etching process with the use of two newly developed Al stages. Using the fabricated structure, we demonstrate efficient vertical coupling with the fiber-to-fiber loss as low as 13. 3 dB. We expect that by integrating the demonstrated coupler structure with the above-mentioned optical beam <b>steering</b> <b>device</b> chip, we could realize wide ranges of vertically emitting beam-steering devices, including the two-dimensional (2 D) beam scanners. 報告番号:; 学位授与日: 2013 - 03 - 25; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科・電気系工学専...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWithin {{the context}} of more and more {{autonomous}} vehicles, an automatic lateral control <b>device</b> (AS: <b>Automatic</b> <b>Steering)</b> was used to steer the vehicle along the road without drivers’ intervention. The device {{was not able to}} detect and avoid obstacles. The experiment aimed to analyse unexpected obstacle avoidance manoeuvres when lateral control was delegated to automation. It was hypothesized that drivers skirting behaviours and eye movement patterns would be modified with automated steering compared with a control situation without automation. Eighteen participants took part in a driving simulator study. Steering behaviours and eye movements were analysed during obstacle avoidance episodes. Compared with driving without automation, skirting around obstacles was found to be less effective when drivers had to return from <b>automatic</b> <b>steering</b> to manual control. Eye movements were modified in the presence of <b>automatic</b> <b>steering,</b> revealing further ahead visual scanning of the driving environment. Resuming manual control is not only a problem of action performance but is also related to the reorganisation of drivers’ visual strategies linked to drivers’ disengagement from the steering task. Assistance designers should pay particular attention to potential changes in drivers’ activity when carrying out development work on highly automated vehicles...|$|R

The problem is solved using a robust P-D feedback controller feeding back the path error {{and the front}} steering angle. The design goal is to follow accurately a desired path independently from {{the presence of a}} possible disturbances (wind forces acting on the aerodynamic center of the side surface of the vehicle) and uncertainties (road, mass and velocity uncertainties). Additionally robust stability of all system variables is required. It is proven that the design requirements can always be satisfied via appropriate P-D feedback.
