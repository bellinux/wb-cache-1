In Delaware, on campus, approximately 400 students were given the oath of allegiance. The men received the regular army training and academic instruction prescribed by the Committee on Education and Special Training of the War Department.

500|$|... 808s & Heartbreak is {{a radical}} {{departure}} from West's previous hip hop albums. According to 33⅓ writer Kirk Walker Graves, 808s & Heartbreak is an avant-garde electropop album. Rolling Stone magazine called it an [...] "introspective, synthpop album," [...] while The 405 described it as West's [...] "experimental pop record." [...] According to The Independent, West abandoned his customary hip hop sound in favor of sparse, drum machine-based electropop. Pitchforks Scott Plagenhoef also categorized the album as [...] "an introspective, minimal electro-pop record", but added that it is [...] "steeped in regret, pain, and even more self-examination than a typical Kanye West album". Music writer Robert Christgau called it a [...] "slow, sad-ass and self-involved ... breakup album" [...] and analyzed that West's choice to [...] "robotize as well as pitch-correct his voice both undercuts his self-importance and adds physical reality to tales of alienated fame that might otherwise be pure pity parties". Christgau asserted that its final track [...] "Pinocchio Story" [...] is [...] "the only track here about what's really bringing [...] down: not the loss of his girlfriend but the death of his mother, during cosmetic surgery that somewhere not too deep down he's sure traces all too directly to his alienated fame." [...] Andre Grant of HipHopDX wrote that [...] "to combat this trenchant melancholia, he poured himself into an all-autotunes R album" [...] which would prove divisive in hip hop. West's singing has been characterized as [...] "flat" [...] and [...] "nearly unmelodic" [...] which [...] "underscores his own cyborgish detachment." [...] Canadian writer Stephen Marche viewed that West used [...] "the shallow musical gimmickry of Auto-Tune, <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> eliminate individuality, and produced a hauntingly personal album." ...|$|E
