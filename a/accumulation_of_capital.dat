5|$|Marx's {{thoughts}} on labour {{were related to}} the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic determinism). <b>Accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> shapes the social system. For Marx, social change was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces. This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory. In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism. Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency ratio and the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to lower rates of labour productivity.|$|E

2500|$|Dutch [...] "merchant capitalism" [...] {{was based}} on trading, {{shipping}} and finance rather than manufacturing or agriculture and marked the transition of the Dutch economy to a new stage. [...] The <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> in the enormous amounts generated in this period caused demand for productive investment opportunities beside the immediate reinvestment in the own business. It also necessitated innovative institutional arrangements to bring demand and supply of investment funds together. From this period date the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and the Amsterdamsche Wisselbank. There were also innovations in marine insurance and legal structuring of firms like the joint stock company. These innovations helped manage risk. For example, ships were financed by shares, with each of 16 merchants, say, holding a 1/16 share. This minimized risk and maximized opportunity for windfall gains.|$|E
2500|$|Alongside Freud, Nietzsche, and Durkheim, Marx thus takes a place {{amongst the}} 19th century {{philosophers}} who criticized this pre-eminence {{of the subject}} and its consciousness. Instead, Marx saw consciousness as political. According to Marx, the recognition of these individual rights {{was the result of}} the universal extension of market relations to all of society and to all of the world, first through the primitive <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> (including the first period of European colonialism) and then through the globalization of the capitalist sphere. Such individual rights were the symmetric of the [...] "right for the labourer" [...] to [...] "freely" [...] sell his labor force on the marketplace through juridical contracts, and worked in the same time as an ideological means to discompose the collective grouping of producers required by the Industrial Revolution: thus, in the same time that the Industrial Era requires masses to concentrate themselves in factories and in cities, the individualist, [...] "bourgeois" [...] ideology separated themselves as competing homo economicus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{causes of}} the Industrial Revolution were {{complicated}} and remain a topic for debate, with some historians believing the Revolution was an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought {{by the end of}} feudalism in Britain after the English Civil War in the 17th century. [...] The Enclosure movement and the British Agricultural Revolution made food production more efficient and less labour-intensive, forcing the farmers who could no longer be self-sufficient in agriculture into cottage industry, for example weaving, and in the longer term into the cities and the newly developed factories. The colonial expansion of the 17th century with the accompanying development of international trade, creation of financial markets and <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> are also cited as factors, as is the scientific revolution of the 17th century.

It revealed, among other insights, {{that there were}} significant differences between Catholics {{on the one hand and}} (white) Protestants and Jews on the other hand with respect to economics and the sciences. Lenski's data supported basic hypotheses of Weber's work The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. According to Lenski, [...] "the contribution of Protestantism to material progress have been largely unintended by-products of certain distinctive Protestant traits. This was a central point in Weber's theory." [...] Lenski noted that more than a hundred years prior to Weber, John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist church, had observed that [...] "diligence and frugality" [...] made Methodists wealthy. [...] "In an early era, Protestant asceticism and dedication to work, as noted both by Wesley and Weber, seem to have been important patterns of action contributing to economic progress.

2500|$|In {{his most}} famous work, The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen writes {{critically}} of the leisure class for its role in fostering wasteful consumption. In this first work Veblen coined the term [...] "conspicuous consumption", which he defined as spending more money on goods than they are worth. The term originated during the Second Industrial Revolution when a nouveau riche social class emerged {{as a result of}} the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> wealth. He explains that members of the leisure class, often associated with business, are those who also engage in conspicuous consumption in order to impress the rest of society through the manifestation of their social power and prestige, be it real or perceived. In other words, social status, Veblen explained, becomes earned and displayed by patterns of consumption rather than what the individual makes financially. Subsequently, people in other social classes are influenced by this behavior and, as Veblen argued, strive to emulate the leisure class. What results from this behavior, is a society characterized by the waste of time and money. Unlike other sociological works of the time, The Theory of the Leisure Class focused on consumption, rather than production.|$|E
2500|$|By placing high {{tariffs on}} imports and other protectionist, inward-looking trade policies, the {{citizens}} of any given country, using a simple supply-and-demand rationale, will substitute the less-expensive good for the more expensive. The primary industry of importance would gather its resources, such as labor from other industries in this situation; the industrial sector would use resources, capital, and labor from the agricultural sector. In time, a third-world country would look and behave similar to a first-world country, and with a new <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and an increase of TFP (total factor productivity) the nation's industry would, in principle, be capable of trading internationally and competing in the world market. Bishwanath Goldar, in his paper ‘Import Substitution, Industrial Concentration and Productivity Growth in Indian Manufacturing’ wrote: [...] "Earlier studies on productivity for the industrial sector of developing countries have indicated that increases in total factor productivity, (TFP) are {{an important source of}} industrial growth," [...] (Goldar 143). He continued: [...] "a higher growth rate in output, other things remaining the same, would enable the industry to attain a higher rate of technological progress (since more investment would be made) and create {{a situation in which the}} constituent firms could take greater advantage of scale economies;" [...] it is believed that ISI will allow this (Goldar 148).|$|E

2500|$|The {{theoretical}} {{problem that}} nevertheless remained in Marx's story, according to von Bortkiewicz and other classical Ricardian theorists, {{was how the}} input and output results of interacting sectors of industry could be modeled in aggregate, so that total product values and total production prices would exactly match up in aggregate, and the price-value divergences at the micro-level would all cancel out at the macro-level. For Bortkiewicz, this redistribution was a purely mathematical problem. The equality of total prices and total values (Bortkiewicz talks about [...] "price units" [...] and [...] "value units") could be understood to mean that they were both equal to a given quantity of gold, or a given quantity of labor hours. A perfectly consolidated result was required as a proof that product-prices represented merely and only a quantitative redistribution of product-values. In turn, that Marxian quantitative proof would, in Bortkiewicz's interpretation, confirm logically {{that there was a}} determinate relationship between product-values and product-prices, since every value quantity would map to a price quantity and, in aggregate, every positive price-value deviation would be balanced out exactly by a proportional negative price-value deviation. Marx's system of categories for describing the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> from production would be validated as logically sound, and as meeting a standard of scientific rigour.|$|E
