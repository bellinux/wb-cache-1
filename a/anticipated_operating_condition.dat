A side effect emerging from rapid widespread and uneven acceptance and fast paced new extensions of the Internet communication technology base is the varying <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> under which a distributed application {{can be expected to}} be running. For mission critical applications especially, and for maximum user satisfaction in general, effectively selecting and controlling the operating environment and behavior of these applications adaptively, without introducing significant software complexity, is a problem which ranges from difficult to impossible, depending on how much adaptivity is needed.

The aim {{of the study was to}} develop methods of recalculation of a test results of a limited number of gas temperature sensors that were received at certified airflow equipment and to get nominal dynamic characteristics of a particular type of gas temperature sensors in the <b>anticipated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> This study offers the algorithm for the identification of the nominal dynamic characteristics of gas temperature sensors that are used to measure the temperature of gases in aircraft gas turbine engines.

40|$|We {{present the}} design, simulation, and {{characterization}} of the radial opposed migration ion and aerosol classifier (ROMIAC), a compact differential electrical mobility classifier. We evaluate {{the performance of the}} ROMIAC using a combination of finite element modeling and experimental validation of two nearly identical instruments using tetra-alkyl ammonium halide mass standards and sodium chloride particles. Mobility and efficiency calibrations were performed over a wide range of particle diameters and flow rates to characterize ROMIAC performance under the range of <b>anticipated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> The ROMIAC performs as designed, though performance deviates from that predicted using simplistic models of the instrument. The underlying causes of this non-ideal behavior are found through finite element simulations that predict the performance of the ROMIAC with greater accuracy than the simplistic models. It is concluded that analytical performance models based on idealized geometries, flows, and fields should not be relied on to make accurate a priori predictions about instrumental behavior if the actual geometry or fields deviate from the ideal assumptions. However, if such deviations are accurately captured, finite element simulations have the potential to predict instrumental performance.

40|$|It is {{extremely}} unlikely that {{significant amounts of}} polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) or polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) will be emitted in the off-gas stream from the thermal desorption process, or the treated waste, particularly if the baseline design and <b>anticipated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> of the enhanced bench-scale (EBS) system are used. However, because of the acute toxicity of these compounds and {{because most of the}} data on their formation have been extrapolated from studies more related to incineration and fire conditions than thermal desorption, specific laboratory tests and specific EBS runs should be performed to monitor the rate of emission of PCDDs and PCDFs under thermal desorption conditions. In general, the following four conditions need to exist for significant amounts of PCDD or PCDF to be formed: (1) the presence of fly ash; (2) the presence of an oxidizing source; (3) a suitable temperature, and (4) the presence of a suitable precursor. Although the EBS system provides some of these conditions, it is unlikely that enough fly ash will be produced in the system to allow a significant amount of PCDD or PCDF formation. Additionally, particulate matter controls will be used to remove airborne particulates from the gas phase.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the performed research is to develop an early anomaly detection methodology so as to enhance safety, availability, and operational flexibility of Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) nuclear power plants. The technical approach relies on suppression of potential power oscillations in BWRs by detecting small anomalies {{at an early stage}} and taking appropriate prognostic actions based on an anticipated operation schedule. The research utilizes a model of coupled (two-phase) thermal-hydraulic and neutron flux dynamics, which is used as a generator of time series data for anomaly detection at an early stage. The model captures critical nonlinear features of coupled thermal-hydraulic and nuclear reactor dynamics and (slow time-scale) evolution of the anomalies as non-stationary parameters. The time series data derived from this nonlinear non-stationary model serves as the source of information for generating the symbolic dynamics for characterization of model parameter changes that quantitatively represent small anomalies. The major focus of the presented research activity was on developing and qualifying algorithms of pattern recognition for power instability based on anomaly detection from time series data, which later can be used to formulate real-time decision and control algorithms for suppression of power oscillations for a variety of <b>anticipated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> The research being performed in the framework of this project is essential to make significant improvement in the capability of thermal instability analyses for enhancing safety, availability, and operational flexibility of currently operating and next generation BWRs...|$|R
40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. Cryosurgery is a {{technique}} for destroying undesirable tissue such as cancers using a freezing process. A previous paper referenced here describes {{the development of a}} thermodynamic modeling tool for a precooled Mixed Gas Joule-Thomson (MGJT) cryoprobe used for cryosurgery. An experimental test facility has been constructed to capture the performance of a precooled MGJT cryoprobe; the experimental data will be used to tune and verify the model. The test facility is flexible relative to working fluid, charge pressure, pressure ratio, and flow rate. Therefore, the facility {{can also be used to}} demonstrate additional cooling capacity available with the optimal mixture compositions and operating parameters selected by the model. A commercially available cryoprobe system has been disassembled and installed in a vacuum insulated dewar. The system has been modified in order to integrate a suite of measurement instrumentation that can completely characterize the performance of individual components as well as the overall system. Measurements include sufficient temperature and pressure sensors to resolve thermodynamic states and flow meters to calculate heat and work transfer rates. A thermal load is applied to the cycle using an electric heater to characterize the refrigeration performance. Temperature sensors are also integrated within the recuperator in order to capture the heat transfer performance of the two-phase, multi-component mixture as it flows through the recuperator.

40|$|Biogas, {{composed}} principally of methane, {{has limited}} use in energy generation {{due to the}} presence of hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S). Biogas cannot be burned directly in an engine as H 2 S present causes corrosion in the reaction chamber. There currently exist various technologies for the removal of H 2 S from a gas stream, but most are chemically based, expensive, and are limited in use. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine a biogas purification technique suitable for a small scale farm application; including using a technology inexpensive, efficient, robust and easy to operate. As such, biofiltration was investigated for H 2 S removal from biogas. Factors considered in the design of the biofiltration system included the source and conditioning of inoculum, type of packing material, and general <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> including inlet gas flow rate and H 2 S loading rate to the biofilter. Activated sludge conditioned in A. ferrooxidans media was an effective inoculum source. This was tested for growth support compatibility with gravel packing material, to be used in the biofilter. The inoculated packing material was loaded into the biofilter initially during start-up and acclimatization. In this study, synthetic biogas (49. 9 %volCH 4, 49. 9 %volCO 2, 2000 ppmv H 2 S) mixed with air (totalling 4 %vol O 2) was added at 5 - 10 L/hr to a biofilter of 0. 4 L gravel packing inoculated with conditioned activated sludge. Baseline H 2 S removal studies in a non-inoculated biofilter were performed with <b>anticipated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions,</b> including an inlet gas stream at 7. 5 L/h (25 oC, 1 atm), resulting in 31 - 56 % H 2 S removal. A factorial test performed found that air content in the inlet gas stream was the significant factor affecting the removal of H 2 S in the non-inoculated biofilter. Operation of the biofilter with biogas was done for 61 days, including 41 days for start-up and acclimatization and 20 days of H 2 S loading tests. Start-up and acclimatization with biogas resulted in complete H 2 S removal after 2 days, with an average overall H 2 S removal of 98. 1 %± 2. 9 std deviation over 34 days. Loading tests performed on the system ranged 5 - 12. 4 L/h (25 oC, 1 atm), with a loading rate of 27. 8 to 69. 5 gH 2 S/m 3 h of filter bed. Throughout this test the average H 2 S removal rate was 98. 9 %± 2. 1 std deviation over 20 days. Although complete H 2 S breakthrough studies were not performed, these results indicate that biofiltration is a promising technology for H 2 S removal from biogas in a small scale application...|$|R
