50|$|Low-odor, isoparaffinic solvent, in {{addition}} to being lower in odor than solvents typically used in solvent-based systems, also has a higher margin of safety versus stronger solvents. The following discussion on Air Change Index (ACI) illustrates that less <b>air</b> <b>turnover</b> is needed when using low-odor, isoparaffinic solvent in comparison to other solvent-based systems such as alkyds.|$|E
50|$|The {{indoor use}} of {{solvent-based}} primer results in increased solvent exposure due to build-up of fumes in the air. One {{way to reduce}} the amount of solvent in the air is to use fans to renew the air. The Air Change Index (ACI) of a solvent is an indication of the margin of safety of a solvent. The lower the ACI, the less <b>air</b> <b>turnover</b> needed.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative and {{first attempt to}} apply the continuous equilibrium approach in modelling the geography of air passenger flows. The Hong Kong-Pearl River Delta region {{is used as a}} case study; and choices of air travellers for both international and domestic flights are modelled over space. The performances of the calibrated models are tested and proven to be in good agreement with the actual market shares of <b>air</b> passenger <b>turnovers</b> of the four major competing airports in the Hong Kong-Pearl River Delta region in 2000. As a step further, we use the model to forecast about the air traffic distribution and catchment areas of the four airports under four alternative scenarios of regional airport competition and airport co-ordination. In future applications, the modelling approach is capable of handling simultaneous changes in the spatial dynamics of a multi-airport region and of catering to the needs of policy relevant research. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

5000|$|Air Force {{opened the}} game with an {{impressive}} ground attack. Air Force quarterback Dee Dowis took his team inside the Irish 20 on the game's first offensive drive. But Pat Terrell, the defensive hero of last week's victory over Miami, stepped into the spotlight again, this time with Stan Smagala. [...] Albert Booker, an Air Force halfback, was carrying the ball on second down when Smagala hit him hard. [...] The ball popped free and Terrell recovered the fumble at the Notre Dame 16. [...] After the <b>turnover,</b> <b>Air</b> Force answered with its first field goal by Steve Yarborough from 22 yards out. [...] But Notre Dame matched that by going 71 yards to score on Mark Green's 7-yard touchdown run. [...] In the second quarter, The Irish continued to run the ball, with quarterback Tony Rice and running back Anthony Johnson both running for touchdowns. [...] Air Force answered {{before the end of}} the half with a touchdown to cut Notre Dame's lead to just seven points.|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{surfactant}} is a lipid-rich {{material that}} promotes alveolar stability {{by lowering the}} surface tension at the air-fluid interface in the peripheral <b>air</b> spaces. The <b>turnover</b> of surfactant phospholipids in the alveolar space is fast, and several lines of evidence suggest there is rapid formation and replenishment of the phospholipid surface film during normal respiration. Specific proteins may regulate these dynamic surface properties. The predominant surfactant protein is a well-characterized, lipid-associated glycoprotein, SP 28 - 36 (28 - 36 kDa). A second group of very hydrophobic proteins has recently been shown to affect the surface activity of surfactant phospholipids. We have isolated this group of hydrophobic proteins, herein called SP 5 - 18 (5 - 18 kDa), from canine surfactant and have shown by NH 2 -terminal sequence analysis {{that at least two}} proteins, SP 5 - 8 and SP 18, are present in this group. We have derived the full amino acid sequence of SP 18 from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNAs identified with oligonucleotide probes that were based on the NH 2 -terminal amino acids of SP 18. The protein isolated from extracellular surfactant appears to be a fragment of a much larger precursor protein (40 kDa). The amino acid sequence of SP 18 is markedly hydrophobic and contains two possible bilayer-spanning domains. We have shown that SP 18 and the glycoprotein SP 28 - 36 have a cooperative, calcium-dependent action in promoting the formation of phospholipid surface films...|$|R
40|$|Winter maximum daily 8 -hour average (MDA 8) ozone {{concentrations}} in the Upper Green River Basin, Wyoming (UGRBWY) and the Uintah Basin, Utah (UBUT) have frequently exceeded 100 ppb in January, February and March, {{in the past few}} years. Such levels are well above the U. S. air quality standard of 75 ppb. In these two remote basins in the Rockies, local ozone precursor emissions result from intense oil and gas extraction activities that release methane, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) to the atmosphere. These emissions become trapped beneath a stable and shallow (~ 50 – 200 m) boundary layer maintained in low wind conditions. Wintertime surface ozone formation conditions are more likely in the UBUT than in the UGRBWY as the topography of the UBUT is an enclosed basin whereas the UGRBWY is open on its southern perimeter thus allowing for more <b>air</b> <b>turnover.</b> With snow-covered ground, high ozone events regularly begin in mid-December and last into early March in the UBUT whereas they usually do not begin in earnest until about a month later in the UGRBWY and may persist until mid-March. Winters without snow cover and the accompanying cold pool meteorological conditions do not experience high ozone events in either basin. For nine years with ozone observations in the UGRBWY (2005 – 2013) and four in the UBUT (2010 – 2013), all years with adequate (≥ 6 inches) and persistent snow cover, experienced days with ozone values ≥ 75 ppb except in 2012 in the UGRBWY when persistent high wind (> 5 m/s) conditions were prevalent. Year to year differences in the occurrences of high ozone episodes appear to be driven primarily by differing meteorological conditions rather than by variations in ozone precursor levels...|$|E
40|$|The {{title of}} this law writing is titled Fulfillment of Prisoners Rights In Getting Sanitation {{facilities}} in Bantul Penitentiary. Under Law No. 12 of 1995 on Corrections. It discusses the legal writing How Fulfillment Prisoners Rights In Getting Sanitation Facilities In Prison Bantul and inhibiting factors to meet the Prisoners Rights In Getting Sanitation facilities in Bantul Penitentiary. This type of research is applied research {{that focuses on the}} normative legal norms of positive law and the study requires secondary data as the main data, while the primary data as supporting. In this study, the data obtained were analyzed using qualitative methods of analysis done by understanding and arranging or reviewing data collected systematically. Horizontally authors systematize the Penal Law by the Law on Human Rights. In this study the authors draw conclusions deductively, which begins with the proposition that was already known and ending at the conclusion of a special nature. Conclusion that efforts to meet the Prisoners Rights In Getting Sanitation Facilities In Bantul Correctional Institution is to provide a clean holding cell, decent bedding, ventilate the room for good <b>air</b> <b>turnover,</b> availability of bathing, washing and toilet are worth taking and the establishment of picket schedule inmates {{in order to make it}} easier to keep the holding cell, so the cell cleanliness of prisoners will continue to live in cleanliness and healthy living. Obstacles to meet the Prisoners Rights In Getting Sanitation facilities in prisons are over capacity Bantul in other words the number of inmates exceeds the capacity of a cell that will result in a lack of oxygen and room holding cell will be stuffy so disturbed the inmates. Then it can hamper the fulfillment of prisoners' rights, and the limiting factor is not in accordance with the applicable legislation, namely Law no. 12 of 1995 concerning correctional governing prisoners' right...|$|E
40|$|Preventing person-to-person {{transmission}} of infectious agents through air {{is an important}} part of the agenda in nosocomial infection control practice. This study utilized the traditional bacteriophage recovery technique to establish a cause-effect relation for airborne viral infection in a full-scale general hospital ward, by using benign Escherichia coli (E. coli) phage (T 1) to simulate infectious virus carried on expiratory aerosols, and its host bacterium (E. coli) as the susceptible individual. The expiratory aerosols were artificially simulated by using a tryptone broth as the spraying medium, which has similar dissolved content and mass concentration as sputum. Aerosol size distribution following the literature reported data was used in simulating actual cough events in the experiments. The spatial bacteriophage exposures were estimated by collecting air samples using an Anderson sampler with the host bacterium (E. coli) pre-inoculated on the plate in the sampler. Incorpporating with the spatial aerosol distribution measured by an aerosol spectrometer, the bacteriophage viability functions at spatial locations of the ward were estimated. By inputting the measured aerosol data together with literature reported infection dose data of influenza into a cumulative dose model, a spatial distribution of hypothetical airborne viral infection risk was estimated for the ward. The experimental results demonstrated that E. coli phage T 1 can withstand the aerosol injection mechanics, but lost about 83 % biological viability by dehydration. After a sufficient evaporation (within about 1 seconds), the variation of viability functions were minor in the 6 -minute test duration, which was the nominal <b>air</b> <b>turnover</b> rate of the ward. The viability functions obtained at various spatial locations exhibited a location independent characteristic. The ventilation flow pattern played significant roles in the expiratory aerosol transmission, leading to the different exposure distribution patterns in the ward. The measured bacteriophage exposures were in reasonable agreement with those estimated by using aerosol counting data, which reveals the possibility of numerical simulation for further study on airborne diseases transmission. The proposed methodology developed in this research may provide understandings on developing efficient ventilation strategies on the basis of nosocomial infection control practice...|$|E
40|$|Tail biting lesions have a {{negative}} effect on both the welfare of pigs and on the revenue of the pig farm. Due to the multifactorial nature of this abnormal behaviour and its sporadic onset, an epidemiological approach was adopted to identify the management and housing factors influencing the occurrence of tail biting and the frequency of bitten pigs in the weaning and fattening phases up to 170 [*]kg live weight in heavy pig production. Data were collected from a sample of 67 commercial pig farms via an on-farm visit and a questionnaire to the farmer. Data collected included general farm information, hygiene and herd health, prevention, management, climate control, feeding and production traits. In the weaning phase, the occurrence of tail biting was increased by a factor of 16. 64 for tipped vs. short-docked tails, by a factor of 68. 09 when the observer detected poor air quality, and by a factor of 14. 44 when the feeding time was variable. In fattening pigs, a high stocking density increased the risk of tail biting by a factor of 18. 00. The frequency of lesions in weaners was greater in pigs with tipped tails (0. 29 vs. 0. 03 %; P[*]=[*] 0. 034), whereas in fatteners the frequency of lesions was greater when drinkers were not present in the lying area (0. 71 vs. 0. 05 %; P[*]=[*] 0. 009) and when <b>air</b> <b>turnover</b> was not detected in the barn (0. 70 vs. 0. 07 %; P[*]=[*] 0. 005). There was also a trend for increased tail biting when the stocking density was high (1. 06 vs. 0. 33 %; P[*]=[*] 0. 057). Many of the risk factors that emerged for heavy pigs in the present study could be easily managed to reduce the risk of tail biting and the frequency of tail lesions through the systematic evaluation and control of stocking density, climate, and feed and water management...|$|E
