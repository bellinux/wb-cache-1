40|$|Abstract. Lay (non-medical) {{injection}} of silicone {{may lead to}} serious clinical consequences. Most reports of illicit cosmetic procedures have dealt with failed, lay <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> breast augmentation. Although these procedures have resulted in severe pneumonitis and alveolar hemorrhage, reports of similar complication after lay <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> buttock augmentation have been sparse. We describe one of these rare cases and review the literature on clinico-pathologic sequelae of lay <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> cosmetic procedures using commercially available silicone preparations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Systems {{designed}} for the automatic summarization of meetings have considered the propositional content of contributions by each speaker, but not the explicit techniques that speakers use to downgrade the perceived seriousness of those contributions. We analyze one such technique, namely <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> humor. We find that speech spent on <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> humorisrarebytimebutthatitcorrelates stronglywithlaughter, which is more frequent. Contextual features describing the temporal and multiparticipant distribution of manually transcribed laughter yield error rates {{for the detection of}} <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> humor which are 4 times lower than those obtained using oracle lexical information. Furthermore, we show that similar performance can be achieved by considering only the speaker’s laughter, indicating that meeting participants explicitly signal their <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> humor by laughing themselves. Finally, we present evidence which suggests that, on small time scales, the production of <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> humor and their ratification via laughter often involves only two participants, belying the allegedly multiparty nature of the interaction.

By 371 BC, Athens and Sparta were again war-weary, and in 371 BC a conference was held at Sparta to discuss another <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> a common peace.|$|E
5|$|A Wizard of Earthsea {{was first}} {{published}} in 1968 by Parnassus Press in Berkeley, a year before The Left Hand of Darkness, Le Guin's watershed work. It was a personal landmark for Le Guin, as it represented her first <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> writing for children; she had written only a handful of other novels and short stories prior to its publication. The book was also her first <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> writing fantasy, rather than science-fiction. A Wizard of Earthsea was the first of Le Guin's books to receive widespread critical attention, and has been described as her best known work, as part of the Earthsea series. The book has been released in numerous editions, including an illustrated Folio Society edition released in 2015. It was also translated into a number of other languages. An omnibus edition of all of Le Guin's Earthsea works is planned to be released on the 50th anniversary of the publication of A Wizard of Earthsea in 2018.|$|E

The treaty was an <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> regulating trade and market expansion between the two regions, but was ultimately unsuccessful.|$|E
