2500|$|At {{this point}} Burns was {{completely}} exhausted and {{quoted as saying}} “I don’t {{want to do anything}} more. I think we have done all this for women, and we have sacrificed everything we possessed for them, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>let</b> them fight for it now. I am not going to fight anymore.” [...] All of her time spent in jail and experiences as a suffragist had left her bitter towards married women and others who didn’t take action during the suffrage movement. [...] After the women of the United States gained the right to vote, Burns retired from political life and devoted herself to the Catholic Church and her orphaned niece. [...] She died on December 22, 1966 in Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
2500|$|More {{and more}} Thérèse {{realised}} {{that she felt}} no attraction to the exalted heights of [...] "great souls". She looked directly for the word of Jesus, which shed light on her prayers and on her daily life. Thérèse's retreat in October 1892 pointed out to her a [...] "downward" [...] path. If asked where she lived, she reflected, must not she {{be able to answer}} with Christ, [...] "The foxes have their lairs, the birds of heaven their nests, but I have no place to rest my head." [...] (Matthew 8:20). She wrote to Céline (letter 19 October 1892), [...] "Jesus raised us above all the fragile things of this world whose image passes away. Like Zacchaeus, we climbed a tree to see Jesus <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>let</b> us listen to what he is saying to us. Make haste to descend, I must lodge today at your house. Well, Jesus tells us to descend?" [...] "A question here of the interior," [...] she qualified in her letter, lest Céline think she meant renouncing food or shelter. [...] "Thérèse knew her virtues, even her love, to be flawed, flawed by self, a mirror too clouded to reflect the divine." [...] She continued to seek to discover the means, [...] "to more efficiently strip herself of self." [...] "No doubt, [...] are already empty of creatures, but, alas, I feel mine is not entirely empty of myself, and {{it is for this reason}} that Jesus tells me to descend." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, yes! I know it's his; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>let's</b> go home <b>and</b> {{pray for}} him, and for you, father. We've both {{got the same}} God, now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{more than}} a coincidence," [...] said Mr. Fenwick decidedly. [...] "It's predestination; {{that is what it}} is. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let's</b> forget it <b>and</b> talk of {{something}} else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That’s just it," [...] said Mrs. Tipping, [...] "here you are, {{and here}} you’ll stay. After you’re married, it’ll be Matilda’s affair; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>let’s</b> have some tea." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let</b> Mr. Pen come in, who {{has been}} waiting all this while.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let</b> us {{see what}} befell Little John while {{these things were}} happening.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let</b> us {{read what}} is written on her scroll:--Mulceo, dum loquor, varios induta colores.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well then,' replied Sir Mulberry, 'I'm satisfied. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let's</b> go <b>and</b> {{have our}} revenge on the German baron and the Frenchman, who cleaned you out so handsomely last night.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{have wanted}} to put a bullet into that knot from the trees back there ever since I have been here, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>let's</b> see if I struck it fairly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Our purpose being honest, the end will be good, Eve, {{though perhaps}} before all is done we may often think it evil. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let's</b> away, though I wish {{that you were}} dressed in another colour." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let</b> me {{read you}} a passage which {{seems to me to}} settle the {{question}} very completely.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now,</b> <b>let</b> Lucan {{never speak}} {{more of the}} wretched Sabellus or Nisidius, but listen and be silent; <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> <b>let</b> Ovid be silent, nor speak again of his serpent that was Cadmus, or his {{fountain}} that was Arethusa; for, says the Tuscan poet, I envy him not. Never did he change the natures of two creatures face to face, so that each received {{the form of the}} other.|$|E
60|$|ERNEST. The ortolans were delightful, and the Chambertin perfect, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>let</b> us {{return to}} the point at issue.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{not where}} {{we ought to}} see it," [...] cried Burke; [...] "we ought to {{see it on the}} stern! But we've got her, boys!"--and then he remembered himself, <b>and</b> added,--"ladies; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>let's</b> give three good cheers!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll do, old fellow," [...] said he. [...] "We've shaken {{down into}} pretty good friends, you and me; and you won't find me working the {{business}} any the less hard for that. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let's</b> scoot for supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{certainly}} isn't, my boy,' {{said the}} boss. 'From now on he's the honoured guest. He shall wear a gold collar and order {{what he wants}} for dinner. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let's</b> be getting home. It's time you were in bed.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let</b> us look in {{the glass}} at them once more, on Saturday morning of the 23d of December.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let</b> me come to {{the second}} problem we opened up in {{connection}} with college education--the problem of its extension.|$|E
6000|$|... "`Right!' cried Smith, {{springing}} up reanimated. `I've passed with honours, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>let</b> me {{go and see}} about being sent down.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Right you are,' said Herbert, {{pretending to}} be cheerful. 'You can't expect, you really can't, {{everything}} to come right straight away. Just have patience. <b>And</b> <b>now,</b> <b>let's</b> go out <b>and</b> sit in the sun. They've mixed September up with May.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, my hearties," [...] said I. [...] "I {{think we}} want a little recreation. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let's</b> turn in, for {{we ought to be}} off by dawn, and then perhaps we may catch them feeding before they move on." ...|$|R

60|$|That {{is the end}} of {{the story}} of the Greek king, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>let</b> us return to the {{fisherman}} and the genius.|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let</b> us ask ourselves, in all sincerity, {{what was}} the final outcome and net result of Darwin's great and useful life? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean {{exactly what}} I say, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>let</b> us cease all bickerings, my dear, and my few {{remaining}} days will be peaceful and happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|TANNER. MY pardon! nonsense! <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let's</b> {{sit down}} <b>and</b> {{have a family}} council. [He sits down. The rest follow his example, more or less under protest]. Violet {{is going to do}} the State a service; {{consequently}} she must be packed abroad like a criminal until it's over. What's happening upstairs? ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs Pad. Then all friends, <b>and</b> confederates. <b>Now</b> <b>let</b> us have father Aldo's delight, and so adjourn the house.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the basis}} vectors are all constant, vector {{addition}} and subtraction {{will simply be}} familiar component-wise adding <b>and</b> subtraction. <b>Now,</b> <b>let</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cease," [...] said Bes in a lordly way. [...] "If you do {{not think}} her {{beautiful}} to-night, you will to-morrow. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let</b> us land and rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{returned}} Betsy, briskly, [...] "we'll {{take your}} word for it, Kaliko. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let</b> us {{get out of}} this tunnel and into the world again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have, like {{everyone}} else, only my own feelings {{of what is}} right to guide me. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let</b> us talk of something else--of dear old Eyethorne again." ...|$|E
50|$|During {{the same}} period a few hundred yards to the east, Chandos House in Chandos Street was used as the Austro-Hungarian Embassy and {{residence}} of the fabulously extravagant Ambassador Prince Paul Anton III Esterhazy, seeing entertainment on a most lavish scale.

6000|$|... "Brave!" [...] she repudiated. [...] "I love you. I {{never knew}} how much, how really much, I loved you as when I was losing you. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>let's</b> work for shore. I want you all alone with me, your arms around me, while I tell you all you are to me and shall always be to me." ...|$|R
50|$|We {{all know}} couples like lovable, {{impractical}} Lorenzo Jones and his devoted wife, Belle. Lorenzo's inventions {{have made him}} a character to the town, but not to Belle, who loves him.
