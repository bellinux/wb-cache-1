50|$|Like most jumping spiders, P. audax {{tends to}} prefer {{relatively}} open areas to hunt in, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> actively <b>seek</b> and stalk prey {{and do not}} build webs to catch food. They do use webbing, however, only when laying eggs or to hide. They also use spider silk as a 'lifeline' when jumping for prey or evading predators.|$|R
50|$|The casino host reports {{directly}} to the marketing managers in most casinos. The Casino Host is the member of management that has the most contact with players and patrons. The job of a Casino Host can be very competitive <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are <b>seeking</b> the repeat patronage of players, a common goal that is shared with competing casinos and their own Casino Hosts.|$|R
5|$|These are {{species of}} craggy mountainous habitats, {{although}} all three will also frequent human habitation. The African rock martin {{and the south}} Asian dusky crag martin are resident, but the Eurasian crag martin is a partial migrant; birds breeding in southern Europe are largely resident, but some northern breeders and most Asian birds are migratory, wintering in north Africa or India. They do not normally form large breeding colonies, but are more gregarious outside the breeding season. These martins build neat mud nests under cliff overhangs or in crevices in their mountain homes, and have readily adapted to the artificial cliffs provided by buildings and motorway bridges. Up to five eggs, white with dark blotches at the wider end, may be laid, and a second clutch is common. Ptyonoprogne martins feed mainly on insects caught in flight, and patrol cliffs near the breeding site with a slow hunting flight <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>seek</b> their prey. They may be hunted by falcons and infected with mites and fleas, but their large ranges and populations mean {{that none of the}} crag martins are considered to be threatened, and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
25|$|Many {{conventional}} {{medical treatments}} clearly {{do not fit}} the nominal definition of allopathy, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>seek</b> to prevent illness, or remove the cause of an illness by acting on the cause of disease.|$|E
25|$|In September and October male {{tarantula}} spiders {{can be seen}} (Aphonopelma smithi) <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>seek</b> a mate. These spiders are harmless unless severely provoked, {{and their}} bite is only as bad as a bee sting. More dangerous are black widow spiders, {{far less likely to}} be encountered in the open.|$|E
5000|$|Leagues are {{international}} organizations composed of states coming {{together for a}} single common purpose.* In this way leagues are different from empires, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> only <b>seek</b> to fulfill a single goal. Often leagues are formed {{on the brink of}} a military or economic downfall. Meetings and hearings are conducted in a neutral location with representatives of all involved nations present.|$|R
2500|$|Chomsky made early {{efforts to}} {{critically}} analyze globalization. He summarized the process {{with the phrase}} [...] "old wine, new bottles", maintaining that the motive of the élites is the same <b>as</b> always: <b>they</b> <b>seek</b> to isolate the general population from important decision-making processes, the difference being that the centers of power are now transnational corporations and supranational banks. Chomsky argues that transnational corporate power is [...] "developing its own governing institutions" [...] reflective of their global reach.|$|R

25|$|In March 2008, Commissioner Kyprianou {{left the}} Commission {{following}} presidential elections in Cyprus {{to become his}} home country's new foreign minister. He was replaced by Androula Vassiliou who was approved by Parliament on 9 April. Commissioners leaving early {{towards the end of}} their mandate is common, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>seek</b> to secure their next job, but can undermine the Commission as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Taxi drivers' {{interests}} {{and those of}} owners are not necessarily aligned. Hong Kong Taxi Owners Association represents owners of taxi licences, and drivers, who are most frequently are not owners but who rent their vehicles on a daily basis, are represented by the Motor Transport Workers General Union. In 2013, day-time drivers would pay upwards of HK$380 for each shift, and night shift drivers would pay HK$350. Owners would dispute with drivers' groups <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>seek</b> to increase the daily rental charge each time taxi fares increased.|$|E
50|$|The Scot’s {{possession}} of what now constitutes the south-east of Scotland {{seems to have}} been recognized by kings of England, even when kings such as Cnut and William the Conqueror invaded, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> did not <b>seek</b> permanent control of the area.|$|R
50|$|The film is {{set over}} a 24-hour {{period in the}} city of Caen, Normandy, and follows Aurélien, known as Orel (Orelsan, as he was {{formerly}} known), and Guillaume, known <b>as</b> Gringe (himself). <b>They</b> <b>seek</b> to finish recording their first song together at the request of their producers Skread (himself) and Ablaye (himself), but struggle to do so <b>as</b> <b>they</b> wander around the town with friends looking for quick ways to make money and a good time.|$|R
50|$|The {{next two}} {{chapters}} describe {{the deployment of}} U.S. military units to face the onrushing North Korean invaders, the growing nervousness of U.S. commanders who issue orders to fire on South Korean refugee columns {{out of fear of}} enemy infiltrators, and the disarray of the weakly led 7th Cavalrymen <b>as</b> <b>they</b> reach the warfront; and then tell of the villagers’ plight <b>as</b> <b>they</b> first <b>seek</b> shelter from the war by gathering in a remote area of their valley, and then are forced by retreating U.S. troops to head south toward U.S. lines.|$|R
25|$|After {{millions}} of years, both the Alterans and the Ori {{learned how to}} ascend and evolved, forming two groups that continued to oppose each other, even at the higher planes of existence. According to the Orici Adria, the Ori-Ancient war on the Ascended plane {{is due to the}} Ancients' intolerance {{for those who do not}} comply with their rules about non-interference. According to Orlin, a de-ascended Ancient, the conflict arises from the Ori's ultimate wish to destroy the Ancients once and for all <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>seek</b> to eliminate all who oppose them.|$|E
25|$|Other {{variations}} of the story exist including {{one in which the}} Scouts are killed after their bus crashes or accidentally catches fire. There is also a version in which the Scouts vanish without explanation and are never found. In some versions of the legend, two Boy Scouts escaped the fate {{of the rest of the}} troop and tried to find help, only to become lost in the woods where they die of starvation and/or exposure. In most {{variations of}} the legend it is said that the dead Scouts haunt the forest where they died and can be heard hiking through the undergrowth, or their lights can be seen at night <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>seek</b> help or their fellow Scouts.|$|E
25|$|The Dark Night (from {{which the}} spiritual term takes its name) narrates {{the journey of}} the soul from its bodily home to union with God. It happens during the night, which {{represents}} the hardships and difficulties met in detachment from the world and reaching {{the light of the}} union with the Creator. There are several steps in this night, which are related in successive stanzas. The main idea of the poem {{can be seen as the}} painful experience that people endure <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>seek</b> to grow in spiritual maturity and union with God. The poem of this title was likely written in 1578 or 1579. In 1584-5, John wrote a commentary on the first two stanzas and first line of the third stanza of the poem.|$|E

50|$|An Internet {{scavenger}} hunt is a fact-finding exercise {{where students}} answer {{a list of}} questions or solve problems <b>as</b> <b>they</b> practice information <b>seeking</b> skills.

25|$|Much {{consolidation}} {{occurred in}} the financial services industry since, {{but not at the}} scale some had expected. Retail banks, for example, do not tend to buy insurance underwriters, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>seek</b> to engage in a more profitable business of insurance brokerage by selling products of other insurance companies. Other retail banks were slow to market investments and insurance products and package those products in a convincing way. Brokerage companies had a hard time getting into banking, because {{they do not have a}} large branch and backshop footprint. Banks have recently tended to buy other banks, such as the 2004 Bank of America and Fleet Boston merger, yet they have had less success integrating with investment and insurance companies. Many banks have expanded into investment banking, but have found it hard to package it with their banking services, without resorting to questionable tie-ins which caused scandals at Smith Barney.|$|E
500|$|It was {{reported}} on May 13, 2011, that Megan Ellison and her production company Annapurna Pictures won {{the rights to}} make {{at least two more}} Terminator films, including Terminator 5, in an auction deal that is rumored to have hit the $20 million mark. While Schwarzenegger was claimed to be up for a substantial role, the film would not be anchored by him; instead, a young male actor would take the lead. On December 4, 2012, {{a year and a half}} after negotiations were entered, the deal was finally closed. Ellison said that she and her brother David Ellison were [...] "starting from scratch <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>seek</b> out a screenwriter to plot the end".|$|E
500|$|Picking up {{the story}} during {{the events of the}} {{previous}} game, The Lost Age puts the player into the roles of the previous games' antagonists, primarily from the perspective of magic-attuned [...] "adepts" [...] Felix and his allies <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>seek</b> to restore the power of alchemy to the world of Weyard. Along the way, the player uses psynergy to defeat enemies and discover new locations, help out local populations, and find elemental djinn which augment the characters' powers. Players can transfer their characters and items from Golden Sun to The Lost Age by means of a password system or Game Link Cable, and players are rewarded for fully completing both games.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{research}} in psychology shows {{that people are}} resilient overall. For example, Southwick and Charney, {{in a study of}} 250 prisoners of war from Vietnam, showed that participants developed much lower rates of depression and PTSD symptoms than expected. Meichenbaum found that while 50-60% of North Americans will experience trauma, only 5-10% generally develop symptoms of PTSD. Similarly, 68 million women of the 150 million in America will be victimized over their lifetime, but only 10% will suffer insofar <b>as</b> <b>they</b> must <b>seek</b> help from mental health professionals.|$|R
50|$|The {{first scene}} opens with the coven {{preparing}} for a ritual, {{only to discover that}} Adrian (Rosemary's baby), now eight years old, is missing from his room. Knowing Rosemary (Patty Duke) must be responsible for this, the coven members use her personal possessions to enable the forces of evil to locate her. Rosemary and Adrian are hiding in a synagogue for shelter. While hiding there, supernatural events begin to affect the rabbis. However, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are <b>seeking</b> sanctuary in a house of God, the coven is unable to affect them.|$|R
