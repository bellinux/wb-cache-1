He also called an overhead shot of Walter standing outside Gus' house alone [...] "one of the best shots in the show's history". Tim Surette of TV.com especially praised the scene with Walter approaching Gus' house, writing: [...] "Breaking Bad has always been good at creating an air of tension, but now {{it seems as though}} the series has mastered it. He also said Paul's acting during Jesse's emotional breakdown [...] "ripped my heart out <b>and</b> <b>shredded</b> it to pieces". The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman said the photography and direction during Jesse's party scenes was masterful: [...] "Here we are four seasons into Breaking Bad and I shouldn't still be amazed at the innovated visuals or perfectly honed sense of sound. These are masters at work, people." [...] Slate writers Jessica Grose and June Thomas both enjoyed the episode, although they found Walter's character increasingly difficult to sympathize with. Both praised the scene when Mike attacked Walter, while Grose especially enjoyed Aaron Paul's performance and Skyler's subplot.|$|E
