5|$|The {{pectoral}} girdle is well known. Both {{the left and}} right scapulae and coracoids are known, though incomplete. The scapulae are large, and robust, and thicken as they near the glenoids. The scapular blades are flat, although they are both convex along the anterior edge. Where the scapulae and coracoids <b>articulate,</b> <b>the</b> coracoids are thickest, and they become gradually thinner as they gain distance from the scapulae. The younger specimen of Patagosaurus possesses a slightly different morphology of the {{pectoral girdle}}, with slightly differing proportions, such as a slightly smaller scapular blade. The coracoids resemble Barapasaurus in shape, and differ from Camarasaurus, although they cannot be directly compared with those of Cetiosaurus.|$|E

25|$|The Mahayana sutras often {{claim to}} <b>articulate</b> <b>the</b> Buddha's deeper, more {{advanced}} doctrines, reserved {{for those who}} follow the bodhisattva path. That path is explained as being built upon the motivation to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name Mahāyāna (lit., the Great Vehicle).

25|$|Joan Severn, {{together}} with Ruskin’s secretary, W. G. Collingwood, and his eminent American friend, Charles Eliot Norton, were executors to his Will. E. T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn edited the monumental 39-volume Library Edition of Ruskin's Works, the last volume of which, an index, attempts to <b>articulate</b> <b>the</b> complex interconnectedness of Ruskin's thought. They all acted together to guard, and even control, Ruskin's public and personal reputation.|$|E
25|$|China did not {{recognize}} Manchukuo but the two sides established official ties for trade, communications and transportation. In 1933, the League of Nations adopted the Lytton Report, declaring that Manchuria remained rightfully part of China, leading Japan to resign its membership. The Manchukuo case persuaded the United States to <b>articulate</b> <b>the</b> so-called Stimson Doctrine, under which international recognition was withheld from changes {{in the international system}} created by force of arms.|$|E
25|$|Adults of Cyclemys also {{develop a}} joint {{in the middle}} of their plastrons (known as a plastral hinge), {{enabling}} them to <b>articulate</b> <b>the</b> front and rear halves to some extent. Unlike the closely related Cuora, which can completely close its shell because of the hinge, Cyclemys plastral hinges only close the shell partially. The plastral hinge may also play a significant role in facilitating egg-laying in adult females.|$|E

25|$|With the {{development}} of statistical techniques and numerical taxonomy in the 1960s, mathematical methods (including Cluster analysis, Principal components analysis, correspondence analysis and Factor analysis) {{have been used to}} build typologies. These techniques provide a qualitative way to <b>articulate</b> <b>the</b> degrees of consistency among particular attributes. Correlation coefficients created by these methods help archaeologists discern between meaningful and useless similarities between artefacts. During the 1990s archaeologists began to use phylogenetic methods borrowed from Cladistics.|$|E
25|$|The aim of {{the project}} then is to explore the use of {{touchless}} interaction within surgical settings, allowing images to be viewed, controlled and manipulated without contact {{through the use of}} camera-based gesture recognition technology. In particular, the project seeks to understand the challenges of these environments for the design and deployment of such systems, as well as <b>articulate</b> <b>the</b> ways in which these technologies may alter surgical practice. While our primary concerns here are with maintaining conditions of asepsis, the use of these touchless gesture-based technologies offers other potential uses.|$|E

25|$|Brouwer's celebrity is not {{exclusively}} {{due to his}} topological work. The proofs of his great topological theorems are not constructive, and Brouwer's dissatisfaction with this is partly what led him to <b>articulate</b> <b>the</b> idea of constructivity. He became the originator and zealous defender {{of a way of}} formalising mathematics that is known as intuitionism, which at the time made a stand against set theory. The fixed-point theorem is, as he originally stated it, false in intuitionism, and Brouwer disavowed it, proposing instead alternative versions to be constructively proven.|$|E
25|$|Hewitt began {{experimenting with}} poetry while still a schoolboy at Methodist College in the 1920s. Typically thorough, his {{notebooks}} from these years {{are filled with}} hundreds of poems, in dozens of styles; Hewitt's main influences at this time included William Blake, William Morris and W. B. Yeats, {{and for the most}} part the verse is either highly romantic, or strongly socialist, a theme which increased in prominence as the 1930s began. Morris is the key figure, combining both these strains, and allowing Hewitt to <b>articulate</b> <b>the</b> radical, dissenting strain which he inherited from his Methodist forbearers, including his father.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} period, rationalist thinkers of the Enlightenment criticized slavery for violating human rights. A {{member of the}} British Parliament, James Edward Oglethorpe, {{was among the first}} to <b>articulate</b> <b>the</b> Enlightenment case against slavery. Founder of the Province of Georgia, Oglethorpe banned slavery on {{humanistic}} grounds. He argued against it in Parliament and eventually encouraged his friends Granville Sharp and Hannah More to vigorously pursue the cause. Soon after his death in 1785, Sharp and More joined with William Wilberforce and others in forming the Clapham Sect. Although anti-slavery sentiments were widespread by the late 18th century, colonies and emerging nations, notably in the southern United States, continued to use and uphold traditions of slavery.|$|E
