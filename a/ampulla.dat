5|$|The {{bottom end}} {{of the body is}} an <b>ampulla</b> (a flask-like swelling), which anchors the animal in the tube and enables it to retract its body very quickly when threatened. When the lophophore is {{extended}} {{at the top of the}} body, cilia (little hairs) on the sides of the tentacles draw food particles to the mouth, which is inside and slightly to one side of the base of the lophophore. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing a lid above the mouth or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The food then moves down to the stomach, which is in the <b>ampulla.</b> Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E
5|$|Bile is {{produced}} by the liver, and serves to eliminate cholesterol and bilirubin from the body, as well as emulsifying of fats {{to make them more}} soluble in water and aid in their digestion. Bile is formed in the liver by hepatocytes (liver cells) and excreted into the common hepatic duct. Part of the bile is stored in the gall bladder because of back pressure (exerted by the sphincter of Oddi), and may be released at the time of digestion. The gallbladder also concentrates the bile by absorbing water and dissolved salts from it. All bile reaches the duodenum (first part of the small intestine) through the common bile duct and the <b>ampulla</b> of Vater. The sphincter of Oddi, located at the junction of the <b>ampulla</b> of Vater and the duodenum, is a circular muscle that controls the release of both bile and pancreatic secretions into the digestive tract.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The electrosensory {{system on}} {{elasmobranchs}} consists of subcutaneous electroreceptor organs known as <b>ampullae</b> of Lorenzini. The present {{study investigated the}} <b>ampullae</b> of Lorenzini morphology of the lesser guitarfish Zapteryx brevirostris, using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The pore number found in the ventral skin surface {{is much higher than}} that found in the dorsal portion, characteristic of species that inhabit the euphotic zone. Under light microscopy it was possible to observe that the wall canal consists of a single layer of squamous epithelial cells. The canal features distal expansion, where the <b>ampullae</b> are located with up to six alveoli. The sensory epithelium of <b>ampullae</b> is composed by cubic cells, with oval nucleus, restricted to the interior of the alveoli. With analysis the clusters under scanning electron microscopy, it was possible to observe the structure and the random arrangement of individual <b>ampullae,</b> canals and nerves. The distribution of dorsal and ventral pores and <b>ampullae</b> in Z. brevirostris resembled those of the same family. The number of alveoli per <b>ampullae</b> was similar to that found in euryhaline elasmobranchs species, suggesting that the morphological organization in Z. brevirostris is linked to its possible evolutionary transitory position among batoids...|$|R

5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma, {{also known}} as bile duct cancer, {{is a form of}} cancer that is {{composed}} of mutated epithelial cells (or cells showing characteristics of epithelial differentiation) that originate in the bile ducts which drain bile from the liver into the small intestine. Other biliary tract cancers include gallbladder cancer and cancer of the <b>ampulla</b> of Vater.|$|E
5|$|Fertilization by a spermatozoon, when it occurs, {{usually takes}} place in the <b>ampulla,</b> the widest section of the fallopian tubes. A fertilized egg {{immediately}} begins the process of embryogenesis, or development. The developing embryo takes about three days to reach the uterus and another three days to implant into the endometrium. It has usually reached the blastocyst stage at the time of implantation.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{standard}} test for biliary obstruction is still {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). This {{involves the use of}} endoscopy (passing a tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and thence to the duodenum) to pass a small cannula into the bile duct. At that point, radiocontrast is injected to opacify the duct, and X-rays are taken to get a visual impression of the biliary system. On the endoscopic image of the <b>ampulla,</b> one can sometimes see a protuberant <b>ampulla</b> from an impacted gallstone in the common bile duct or the frank extrusion of pus from the common bile duct orifice. On the X-ray images (known as cholangiograms), gallstones are visible as non-opacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in critically ill patients in whom delay for diagnostic tests is not acceptable; however, if the index of suspicion for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed common bile duct.|$|E
25|$|Amphibians {{and most}} fish {{do not possess}} seminiferous tubules. Instead, the sperm are {{produced}} in spherical structures called sperm <b>ampullae.</b> These are seasonal structures, releasing their contents during the breeding season, and then being reabsorbed by the body. Before the next breeding season, new sperm <b>ampullae</b> begin to form and ripen. The <b>ampullae</b> are otherwise essentially identical to the seminiferous tubules in higher vertebrates, including the same range of cell types.|$|R
40|$|Two {{practices}} of art historical research currently distort {{the study of}} Asia Minor ampullae: conflating the Asia Minor <b>ampullae</b> with St. Menas flasks and applying sweeping models of “pilgrimage art” to <b>ampullae.</b> This study examines and overturns both interpretive issues. I deconstruct the predominant interpretative model (the locus sanctus model), which relies on iconographic and localized notions of “sacred mimesis” and “contagion” to determine the circumstances of production, distribution, and social meaning of Asia Minor <b>ampullae.</b> Formal, visual, and contextual analysis of published objects and catalogued <b>ampullae</b> from Sardis, which focuses on materiality and reception, disassociate the Asia Minor corpus from that of Menas. By introducing the concept of “infinite divinity,” I free the Asia Minor <b>ampullae</b> from the absolute locative conditions of the locus sanctus model and provide an alternate understanding of their connection to sacred travel and devotion in late antiquity. 2019 - 06 - 0...|$|R

5|$|Some {{evidence}} of early evolutionary {{history is the}} structure of the antennal heart, a separate circulatory organ consisting of two ampullae, or vesicles, that are attached to the frontal cuticle to the bases of the antennae. These features have not been found in other insects. An independent organ exists for each antenna, consisting of an <b>ampulla,</b> attached to the frontal cuticle medial to the antenna base and forming a thin-walled sac with a valved ostium on its ventral side. They pump blood by elastic connective tissue, rather than muscle.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth is}} inside {{the base of the}} crown of tentacles but to one side. The gut runs from the mouth {{to one side of the}} stomach, in the bottom of the <b>ampulla.</b> The {{intestine}} runs from the stomach, up the other side the body, and exits at the anus, outside and a little below the crown of tentacles. The gut and intestine are both supported by two mesenteries (partitions that run the length of the body) connected to the body wall, and another mesentery connects the gut to the intestine.|$|E
5|$|Dynamic {{balance is}} {{provided}} through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (at right angles) to each other. At {{the end of}} each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the <b>ampulla,</b> which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.|$|E

40|$|After a {{prolonged}} scrutiny of numerous colonies of Millepora in {{the collections of}} various museums I found, besides a number of colonies with open <b>ampullae,</b> ten specimens possessing <b>ampullae</b> with their coverings of a trabecular network. The chief details of these <b>ampullae</b> were described in a previous paper (Boschma, 1949 a). Afterwards I {{had the good fortune}} to obtain material of different species of Millepora from six localities showing <b>ampullae</b> in an undamaged state. These <b>ampullae</b> are figured and described in the present paper. I am greatly indebted to Mr. Harold Gatty of Suva, who enabled me to visit coral reefs in the Fiji Islands during the time I stayed in this locality (March, 1949). I want to thank Dr. C. H. Edmondson, curator, Bernice P. Bishop Museum, Honolulu, for a specimen collected by him on Johnston Island. I am much obliged to Dr. R. W. Hiatt, University of Hawaii, for presenting to me specimens collected by him at Bikini Island and at Yap Island. To Dr. P.

50|$|Various {{cultural}} practices converged {{to bring about}} the pilgrim badge. Pilgrims had long sought natural souvenirs from their destination to commemorate their trip and bring home some of the site's sanctity. The earliest and still iconic pilgrim 'badge' was the scallop shell worn by pilgrims to the shrine of Santiago de Compostela. Along with badges, vendors at holy sites sold <b>ampullae,</b> small, tin vessels designed to carry holy water or oil from the site. The later metal examples derive from clay <b>ampullae</b> sold from the Early Middle Ages to pilgrims to the Holy Land and other sites in North Africa and the Middle East. These often bore images from the saint's life. The main vessel of the early <b>ampullae</b> from the shrine of St Thomas Becket is often textured to appear like a scallop shell, showing how flat, wearable signs and <b>ampullae</b> came to be conflated in the medieval imagination. Badges and <b>ampullae</b> were worn while travelling and allowed others to identify the wearer as a pilgrim and the saint they were visiting. They showed the wearer's special relationship with the saint and could be called upon in times of crisis. Badges were an artistically legible and affordable accessory for the ordinary medieval pilgrim to wear.|$|R
