5|$|Following Jefferson's {{return to}} Grimsby, Marstrand's were puzzled by Orsborne's actions, but {{initially}} {{thought that he}} had taken on another engineer in Dover <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> fishing, perhaps in new grounds. There were unconfirmed sightings of Girl Pat in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere. As weeks passed with no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or barratry, and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling £2,400 from the underwriters, when they were surprised by the arrival of bills from Corcubión, together with the news that Girl Pat had sailed from the port on 24 April, her destination unknown.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was last}} {{referred}} to in active use in 1316, after which it was probably allowed to decay; further stonework {{was taken by the}} keeper of Rockingham Forest in 1373, by which time the castle had probably been abandoned. By the 15th century, Sauvey formed a subsidiary property of Withcote manor - a reversal of the old land holding pattern. Its structures had mostly been dismantled or destroyed by 1622 <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> entirely {{by the end of the}} century.|$|E

5|$|Raghip's {{parents had}} moved from Cyprus to England in 1956. Raghip left school at age 15, illiterate, {{and by the time}} of the murder had two convictions, one for {{stealing}} cars and one for burglary. He had a common-law wife, Sharon Daly, with whom he had a two-year-old boy, and he worked occasionally as a mechanic. He had little connection with Broadwater Farm, though he lived in nearby Wood Green <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> to the Farm with two friends to watch the riot, he said. One of those friends, John Broomfield, gave an interview to the Daily Mirror on 23 October, boasting about his involvement. When Broomfield was arrested, he implicated Raghip. Broomfield was later convicted of an unrelated murder.|$|E
5|$|The Crusader army's pace was {{dictated}} by the infantry and baggage train; the Ayyubid army, being largely mounted, {{had the advantage of}} superior mobility. Efforts to burn crops and deny the countryside to the Frankish army were largely ineffective as it could be continuously provisioned from the fleet, which moved south parallel with it. On 25 August the Crusader rearguard was crossing a defile when it was almost cut off. However, the Crusaders closed up so speedily that the Muslim soldiery was forced to flee. From 26 to 29 August Richard's army had a respite from attack because while it hugged the coast <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> round the shoulder of Mount Carmel, Saladin's army had struck across country. Saladin arrived in the vicinity of Caesarea before the Crusaders, who were on a longer road. From 30 August to 7 September Saladin was always within striking distance, and waiting for an opportunity to attack if the Crusaders exposed themselves.|$|E
5|$|The Historian was {{the first}} debut novel to land at number one on The New York Times bestseller list in its first week on sale, and as of 2005 was the fastest-selling {{hardback}} debut novel in U.S. history. The book sold more copies on its first day in print than The Da Vinci Code– 70,000 copies were sold {{in the first week}} alone. As of the middle of August 2005, the novel had already sold 915,000 copies in the U.S. <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> through six printings. (For comparison, according to Publishers Weekly, only ten fiction books sold more than 800,000 hardcover copies in the US in 2004.) Little, Brown and Company also released an edition of Dracula in September 2005 with an introduction by Kostova, thinking her readers would want to delve into the original novel after reading hers. Kostova {{is one of the few}} female bestselling authors, but her popularity is unusual because it is founded on a literary novel.|$|E

The division continued the pursuit until it was relieved on 10 November, and the following day the Armistice with Germany came into force.

25|$|He was {{disappointed}} when Gollancz turned down Burmese Days, {{mainly on the}} grounds of potential suits for libel, but Harper were prepared to publish it in the United States. Meanwhile, Blair started work on the novel A Clergyman's Daughter, drawing upon his life as a teacher and on life in Southwold. Eleanor Jacques was now married <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> to Singapore and Brenda Salkield had left for Ireland, so Blair was relatively isolated in Southwold – working on the allotments, walking alone and spending time with his father. Eventually in October, after sending A Clergyman's Daughter to Moore, he left for London to take a job that had been found for him by his aunt Nellie Limouzin.|$|E
25|$|From its {{construction}} until 1902, Netley Hospital {{served as the}} home of the Army Medical School, training civilian doctors for service with the army. In A Study in Scarlet, Dr. Watson recounts his earlier life before meeting Sherlock Holmes; it is established that Watson received his medical degree from the University of London in 1878, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> on to train at Netley Hospital as a surgeon in the Army. As many patients were suffering from tropical diseases, the hospital was also used for medical research. The first thing that confronted anyone entering the imposing central tower block was a large museum of natural history and anatomical specimens, reflecting the interests of many of the doctors.|$|E

25|$|Jenkin {{decided to}} limit the 1985/86 budget of 15 of these councils to the cash level of their 1984/85 budget. In the cases of the GLC, ILEA and Greenwich, where budgets were over 70% above their grant-related expenditure, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> up by more than 30% since 1981/82, he placed the cap at 1½% below the 1984/85 budget. 16 out of the 18 councils were under {{majority}} control by Labour {{at the time they}} were designated. The exceptions were Portsmouth, where there was a Conservative majority, and Brent where no party had an overall majority. A Labour administration had held power but when Labour councillor Ambrozine Neil joined the Conservatives in December 1983, the Conservatives took control with Liberal support.|$|E
25|$|After the {{surprise}} was lost the German offensive got bogged down as they faced increased organized Soviet defenses and difficult surroundings. The rough terrain, {{the lack of}} maps and the Arctic weather slowed the Germans down for {{the entirety of the}} offensive. Against heavy Soviet resistance, the 2nd Mountain Division could not penetrate the Soviet defenses at the Rybachy peninsula further, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> into defensive positions at its neck by July. Some of its units were sent south to aid the 3rd Mountain Division. With joined forces the Germans were able to advance further east against heavy resistance and reached the Litsa River, where they established a bridgehead over the river. Here the Soviets were able to halt the German advance. An attempt by Dietl's forces to expand the bridgehead towards the east failed, when the Soviets launched a flanking attack by landing further north on the German side, threatening the German positions. Dietl asked for further reinforcements, but the German High Command was unwilling to grant further units, and Dietl received only marginal reinforcements from Norway.|$|E
25|$|The White Rock Boat Club {{was formed}} in 1961 as the brainchild of {{three members of the}} Corinthian Sailing Club. CSC was having a problem with {{tracking}} davit ownership and the price of davits escalated due to demand since the club had no control over prices. Two of the founders, the Oetkings, had also developed a fine catamaran called the Hellcat <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> into production with growing sales, but they couldn't find davits at CSC. WRBC was constructed not only to supply reasonably priced davits, but to help sell Hellcats. The club sold davits {{to help pay for the}} construction of the club, with the provision that the club could buy the davit back if the owner left the club. The club has exercised this right and now owns and leases most of its davits. The club was constructed with a few differences from its present configuration as can be seen in the 1968 photo above. In order to promote organized class sailing, WRBC at one time limited the type of boats kept at the club to racing classes. In the 1970s, the following classes of sailboats were eligible for membership: Butterfly, Coronado 15, Flying Scot, Harpoon, Lido, Lone Star 13, MC Scow, M16 Scow, M20 Scow and Rebel. The club remains active on the lake today.|$|E
