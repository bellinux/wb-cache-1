50|$|Ancylostoma duodenale is {{prevalent}} in southern Europe, northern Africa, India, China, and southeast Asia, small areas of United States, the Caribbean islands, and South America. This hookworm {{is well known}} in mines because of the consistency in temperature and humidity that provide an ideal habitat for egg and juvenile development. It is estimated 1 billion people are infected with hookworms. Transmission of Ancylostoma duodenale is by contact of skin with soil contaminated with larvae. The way Ancylostoma duodenale enters the human body was understood in the 1880s, after an epidemic of <b>ancylostomiasis</b> among miners working in the hot and humid Gotthard Tunnel (Switzerland).|$|E

The results are summarized as follows: (1) The number of annual deaths from <b>ancylostomiasis,</b> Which showed a sudden increase following the termination of Pacific War, has recently shown a tendency to decrease. It is, however, still greater than in years before the war. (2) The <b>ancylostomiasis</b> death rate (the number of deaths in total population) rises with age in both men and women. It is markedly high amongwomenthanamongmen; <b>ancylostomiasis</b> death rates among matured women are almost {{twice as high as}} among corresponding, age groups in men. There are marked differences in <b>ancylostomiasis</b> death rates by year and locality of men and women. (3) The geographical distribution of <b>ancylostomiasis</b> death rates shows that they are low in Hokkaido and Tohoku Districts and high in Kyushu and Chugoku Districts, and that they are low in urban communities and high in rural communities. (4) Analysis of death rates among various professional groups shows that the death rate among farmers is higher than among any other professional groups.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the haematological parameters {{and assess the}} comparatively mild, moderate and severe effects of trypanosomiasis and <b>ancylostomiasis</b> on local dog breeds. Methods: Diagnosis of trypanosomiasis was based on clinical signs and presence of Trypanosoma congolense in wet mount of infected animals. Diagnosis of <b>ancylostomiasis</b> was based on clinical signs and presence of Ancylostoma caninum eggs in fecal samples. Fecal samples were examined using modified McMaster technique. Haematological parameters assessed were packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin concentration (HbC), total leucocyte counts and differential leucocyte counts. Results: The severity of anaemia produced was graded into mild, moderate and severe. The infected dogs with mild trypanosomiasis and <b>ancylostomiasis</b> had slightly elevated temperatures. Other symptoms observed included dullness, depression, muscular weakness and pale mucous membranes. The infected dogs with mild <b>ancylostomiasis</b> also showed anorexia. The mean PCV and HbC values for mild infections with T. congolense and A. caninum were significantly (P < 0. 05) {{lower than those of}} normal dogs. The mean total WBC counts for both mild trypanosomiasis and <b>ancylostomiasis</b> were within the normal range when compared with the values for normal dogs. In all the cases of trypanosomiasis and <b>ancylostomiasis,</b> the total differential counts of monocytes were significantly (P < 0. 05) lower than the normal values. There were obvious clinical signs such as pyrexia, anaemia, enlarged lymph nodes, subcutaneous oedema and occasional ophthalmitis for most of the dogs with severe trypanosomiasis. The mean PCV and HbC values of severe trypanosomiasis and <b>ancylostomiasis</b> were significantly lower than the normal values and also lower than all other cases of the disease condition. Anaemia was associated with both disease conditions but more severe in acute cases of trypanosomiasis. Conclusions: This study shows that dogs in this area are at risk of trypanosome infection all the year round, although the incidence of infection is the highest during the rainy season. Understanding on the causes of the changes in the composition of the blood in mixed infections of trypanosomiasis and <b>ancylostomiasis</b> is necessary...|$|E

40|$|Clincal {{studies of}} <b>ancylostomiasis,</b> {{particularly}} the anemic symptoms that attend it, {{were carried out}} in 482 patients seen at Satte Agricultural Cooperative Hospital in Saitama Prefecture. These patients were examined 5 weeks {{before and after the}} administration of an anthelmintic. The incidence of <b>ancylostomiasis</b> is still very high in the farming community, especially among the grownups, The chief symptoms consisted of epigastric fullness and discomfort, belly ache, ennui, short breath anc dizziness. An iron preparation was the most effective in the treatment of anemia that occurred after expelling the worms, followed by a kidney extract. It was found that those receiving no medication had had anemia for quite a long time. There was a slight increase in leukocyte count, which was presumed to be due to the increase in eoginophil cell count. Liver function, which showed a slight disturbance in <b>ancylostomiasis,</b> was found to improve rapidly as soon as the worms were expelled. A high percentage of patients had positive fecal occult blood test, but they soon became negative after the worms were expelled. In view of these findings, the need for early diagnosis and the administration of an anthelmintic, coupled with an effective remedy for anemia, to be given to all the outpatients should be emphasized, though {{it goes without saying that}} the organization of a compaign for the prevention of hookworm infestation in imperative...|$|E
40|$|Studies made on {{cases of}} <b>ancylostomiasis</b> among the outpatients of Goi Health Center {{for the years}} 1953 and 1954 {{revealed}} the following results : (1) Of 1, 651 patients seen at the outpatients 2 ̆ 7 consulting room of Goi Health Center, 284 patients, or 17. 2 per cent, {{were found to be}} affected with <b>ancylostomiasis.</b> There was a significant difference between {{men and women in the}} incidence of <b>ancylostomiasis,</b> it being higher among women than among men. It seems imperative that a health center, which is the institution officially responsible for public health, should work out a program for organization of anti-parasite worm campaigns in the rural district. (2) The incidence of <b>ancylostomiasis</b> tended to be high in areas where hookworm infections as investigated by Kawamoto were high. (3) The curve representing the monthly occurrences of <b>ancylostomiasis</b> showed that they were highest in the months from June through August. This seems to indicate that the time of infection, over-work and under-nourishment during the farming season, and wasting of the body during summer have an important bearing on the occurrence of the disease. (4) The chief complaints of patients with <b>ancylostomiasis</b> included languor (in 20 per cent of patients), dizziness, palpitation, shortness of breath and headache (in over 10 per cent of them). This observation agrees well with the observations of various workers. The author feels that the disturbance caused by latent infection with hookworms is an important factor in the onset and aggravation of the so-called 2 ̆ 2 farmers 2 ̆ 7 disease. 2 ̆ 2 Investigations conducted on infection with Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanum among 621 farmers from the three communities of Murakami, Wanme and Aikawa, which had had a high incidence of <b>ancylostomiasis</b> among their inhabitants visiting the outpatients 2 ̆ 7 consulting room of Goi Health Center, revealed the following results : (1) The rate of hookworm infections in the three communities was as high as 75. 4 per cent, there being no difference between men and women in the rate. (2) The rate of hookworm infections was low among younger age groups and high among grownups, agreeing well with the results of investigations by other workers. It is worthy of note that the rate among the age groups 5 - 14 (children of school age) was 50 per cent. The curve representing the rates of hookworm infections among different age groups shows that the rate of hookworm infection among the age group 16 - 19 nearly corresponded to the average rate of infection among the whole population. (3) The areas under study proved to have a mixed infection, the ratio of A. duodenale infections to N. americanum infections being 1 : 1. 1. The number of the worms of N. americanum expelled in the stools was greater than that of the worms of A. duodenale, the ratio being 1 : 4. (4) The average numbers of worms expelled per person were: A. duodenale, 14. 4 and N. americanum, 48. 7. This shows that hookworm infections in the areas under study were not only widespread as witnessed to by the high rate of infections but also massive, each individual harboring great numbers of worms. The greatest numbers of worms expelled from a single person were 74 worms of A. duodenale and 2, 057 worms of N. americanum. The numbers of the two different species of worms expelled by men were twice as many as those expelled by women. (5) The curves representing the infection with the two species of worms among various age groups showed that the rates of infections were low among younger age groups, tending to be higher among older age groups. The curves representing the numbers of the two species of worms expelled by persons belonging to various age groups showed a similar tendency. It appeared that the hookworm larvae gained entrance to the body mainly by way of the skin in these areas...|$|E
40|$|Sixty persons {{free from}} {{diseases}} other than <b>ancylostomiasis</b> were drawn at random {{from among the}} males in the age group 20 - 30 who had visited for physical examination at Got Health Center in Chiba Prefecture, and the incidence of hookworm infection among them was determined. Hematologic examinations were carried out in them and persons free from hookworm infection, who serving as controls. They {{were divided into two}} groups, one patients with <b>ancylostomiasis</b> the other carriers. The results of hematologic examinations in one group were compared with the other group. Futhermore they were divided into several groups based on the kind and number of worms expelled, and the hematologic tests were compared from group to group. The following observations were made: 1. Persons visited Goi Health Center, who lived areas of high incidence of hookworm, infection had an incidence of 25 % of <b>ancylostomiasis.</b> Hookworm carriers unaware of the infection were found among the visitors at the rate of 1 in 3. 2. In <b>ancylostomiasis</b> group, persons harkoring more than 30 worms (determined by the numbers of worms expelled and counted in terms of A. duodenale) accounted for 50 of the total, with an average parasitism of 49 worms. In carrier group, many persons harbored 1 to 9 worms and none over 30 worms, with an average of 8 worms. 3. Even if free from any subjective symptoms, hookworm carriers were more anemic than controls, with a tendency to increased reticulocyte count. Marked anemic symptoms and increased reticulocyte count characterized patients with <b>ancylostomiasis.</b> Eosinophil cell count was increased in both groups. Leukocyte count showed no change. 4. Infection with A. duodenale alone or A. duodenale combined with N. americanus seemed to have a greater influence on blood picture than infection with N. americanus alone. Marked anemic symptoms, increased reticulocyte count and increased eosinophil cell count were noted in the former. 5. Influence of parasitism on the host was investigated and compared among the groups divided by the numbers of worms expelled, 1 - 9, 10 - 29, 30 - 99, and over 100 (in terms of A. duodenale). Results show that influence of parasitism grew with increased number of worms harbored. The influence seems to make itself felt when the number exceeds 30. 6. In carrier group, Proportion of hemoglobin had a close correlation with erythrocyte count and an inverse correlation with reticulocyte count, but its relation with eosinophil cell count was not established. 7. In carrier group, number of worms expelled had an inverse correlation with erythrocyte count and proportion of hemoglobin, and a correlation with reticulocyte count. These relationships were marked in persons harboring more than 30 worms. Number of worms expelled was not related to eosinophil cell count. 8. In view of results of the present investigation, it is hoped that health centers in rural areas should carry out tests for hookworm eggs in regular physical examination, and that a campaing should be organized on a large scale to clear their respective areas of hookworm carriers...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{great need}} for {{prevention}} against parasitosis {{in the field of}} community health, though in actual practice, the mass examination for parasite carriers has not succeeded to get enough rate of receiving the examination. Because of this problem the author has investigated the conditions the performance of health practice against parasitosis, systematically. In order to get some criteria for the evaluation of the parasite control in communities, the author has investigated statistically the results of parasitic egg examination among general residents comparing to those of the school children at the same communities on O-prefecture. The objects were selected among the areas in this prefecture officially designed for "the promotion of preventive practice against ancylostomiasis". The studies have been carried out statistically and the results checked by the field surveys to learn the social factors influencing the receiving rate of examination and the efficiency of the practice. The results of the studies have been as follows: 1) By examining annual change of correlation between the rates of general residents and those of the school children in the same communities, there have been observed differences among the kinds of parasites. 2) Concerning "the special areas for preventive practice against ancylostomiasis" the parasite carries among the children has showed high correlation with those among general residents {{at the beginning of the}} designation as the special areas. This correlation has changed as the preventive practice proceeded. About ascariasis and other parasitoses, the correlation between the children and general residents have maintained relatively unchanged in high value. The differences of the elapse between the numbers of <b>ancylostomiasis</b> and the others could be derived from the ecological specialities and the mode of infection. 3) Correlation between the residents and children was high in <b>ancylostomiasis</b> when the receiving rate was over 80 % and the same could be said in ascariasis when it was over 60 %. 4) Also high correlation were observed between 1 to 3 % of <b>ancylostomiasis</b> among school children, and under 15 % of ascariasis among them. 5) These statistical results have been investigated expecting to get some criteria for evaluation of preventive practice. 6) The results of field survey about factors influencing on these data have been described...|$|E

Sera from the following groups were examined: 10 patients with EE (unexplained recurrent abdominal pain and related symptoms, with peripheral eosinophilia) from Townsville and Brisbane; 2 persons known to be infected with A. caninum and 20 presumed unexposed healthy controls; 20 patients with other gastrointestinal diseases; 20 with other identified parasitic infections; and 20 with atopic conditions. High levels of specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgE antibodies were found in patients with EE but not other gastrointestinal disease. Excretory-secretory (ES) products were more discriminating than somatic antigens in the elisa and the IgG/ES-elisa was the most specific; occasional cross-reactions could be explained on epidemiological or parasitological grounds.

However, the increasing occurrence of resistance to allopathic treatments stimulates the search for new therapeutic inputs, among which the probiotics stand out and are able to positively alter the intestinal microbiota and exert immunomodulatory effect. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the applicability of using species of Lactobacillus (L. acidophilus ATCC 4536, L. plantarum ATCC 8014, and L. delbrueckii UFV H 2 B 20) to control canine <b>ancylostomiasis.</b> A probiotic preparation containing 1 × 106 CFU of each strain was administered to 10 naturally infected animals, on alternate days for 28 days. It was observed that the treatment with the probiotic preparation led to a significant reduction in EPG of feces (88. 83 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{the effect of}} iron supplementation on {{measures}} of school performance among 78 iron-deficient anemic and 41 nonanemic children in an economically deprived rural area in Central Java, Indonesia. All the subjects were treated for <b>ancylostomiasis</b> before iron supplementation. They {{were randomly assigned to}} either an iron or placebo group. Hematological and behavioral measurements were obtained immediately before (Ti) and after (T 2) the iron and placebo treatments. Iron treatment for a 3 -mo period resulted in substantive increases in mean Hgb, Hct, and transferrin saturation among the iron-deficient anemic children. Furthermore, changes in the iron status of iron-deficient anemic children were associated with significant changes in the school achievement test scores of iron-deficient anemic children. T 2 evaluation of achievement test scores indicated that the difference between iron-treated anemic and nonanemic children was still statistically significant. However, when TI scores were entered as a covariate, iron-deficient anemic subjects treated with iron obtained significantly higber delta achievement scores. Findings from the present study indicate that iron supplementation among iron-deficient anemic children benefits learning processes as measured by the school achievement test scores...|$|E
