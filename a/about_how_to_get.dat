500|$|The story {{takes place}} during three years (1933–35) of the Great Depression in the fictional [...] "tired old town" [...] of Maycomb, Alabama, {{the seat of}} Maycomb County. It focuses on six-year-old Jean Louise Finch (nicknamed Scout), who lives with her older brother, Jeremy (nicknamed Jem), and their widowed father, Atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer. The three {{children}} are terrified yet fascinated by their neighbor, the reclusive Arthur [...] "Boo" [...] Radley. The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo, and few of them have seen him for many years. [...] The children feed one another's imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{him out of his}} house. After two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone leaves them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place. Several times the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their disappointment, he never appears in person.|$|E
500|$|According to Gay, {{characters}} with [...] "extreme personality quirks" [...] were both fun and stressful to write: for the clown Moe, {{he found it}} challenging to get the balance right between his silly jokes and the seriousness of his dialogue. Among other challenging characters to write for were Acro, who led to [...] "heated arguments" [...] <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his personality and tone right; and Morgan Fey, whose [...] "very old style" [...] of speaking in the Japanese version was difficult to translate to English. One aspect they had to change due to cultural differences was {{a conversation with the}} lecherous character Director Hotti, where an animation of him grabbing in the air with his hands is played while he talks about Pearl. According to Hsu, the Japanese version is considered funny to Japanese people, as Hotti is set up as the [...] "butt of the joke", and Phoenix reacts negatively to him, while it would have been considered sickening to an American audience. They were unable to change the animation, so the dialogue was rewritten to instead be directed at an adult nurse.|$|E

2500|$|Blackmun further {{described}} how the court’s past precedent had whittled down the “commercial speech” exemption through past precedent; for example, Bigelow v. Virginia, , {{in which the}} Court struck down a Virginia statute prohibiting the advertisement of out-of-state abortion procedures. [...] He also distinguished commercial speech from such “unprotected” categories of speech such as “fighting words” and obscenity. [...] Nor does having a purely economic interest {{in the content of}} speech deprive the speaker or listener of the protection of the First Amendment. [...] This is especially true for the consumers in this case, as the poor, elderly, and infirm needed access to such information to make informed decisions <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> their prescriptions filled inexpensively. [...] For such people in need, Blackmun reasoned, such information was more than simply a convenience. [...] Furthermore, he stressed the importance of price advertising in a free market economy, because they serve to provide the underlying information for citizens to make private economic decisions.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 December 2009, the {{companion}} book The Good Game Gamer's Guide to Good Gaming (...) was released. The {{premise is that}} due to statistics like the Australian gaming industry profiting over $1 billion and in profit and 95% of Australian youth calling themselves gamers, [...] "the chances are that someone close to you cares a bit about videogames and also knows a bit about...Good Game". Therefore, this [...] "guide to videogaming", designed to cater to the spectrum of gamers from [...] "hardcore pros to excitable newbies", includes information on things like: [...] "the best games of all time, the main genres of gaming, gaming trends, the key developers whose work {{you need to know}} <b>about,</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into the industry, how games evolved and where things are headed" [...] was conceived. The book also helps readers to [...] "understand developments, get good ideas, learn about ratings, make connections...find out what makes gamers tick... tips on improving [...] gaming skills". Just like the show, it features descriptions of games which should be played, history about game development in Australia and other general video game related discussions. It was co-written by hosts Steven O'Donnell and Jeremy Ray and show producers Janet Carr and Maurice Branscombe, and was published by ABC Books. Girl.com.au described the book as a [...] "fantastic guide" [...] and [...] "brilliantly packaged", and added it is [...] "not only a great insight into the gaming world, but also helpful for those in the know and those just getting a taste for gaming".|$|E
60|$|For {{after the}} Queen had {{transmitted}} the French overtures to Holland, and the States found Her Majesty was bent in earnest upon {{the thoughts of}} a peace, they began to cast <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the negotiation into their own hands. They knew that whatever power received the first proposals, would be wise enough to stipulate something for themselves, as they had done in their own case, both at The Hague and Gertruydenberg, where they carved as they pleased, without any regard {{to the interests of}} their nearest allies. For this reason, while they endeavoured to amuse the British court with expostulations upon the several preliminaries sent from France, Monsieur Petecum, a forward meddling agent of Holstein, who had resided some years in Holland, negotiated with Heinsius, the Grand Pensionary, as well as with Vanderdussen and Buys, about restoring the conferences between France and that republic, broke off in Gertruydenberg. Pursuant to which, about the end of May, N.S. one thousand seven hundred and eleven, Petecum wrote to the Marquis de Torcy, with the privity of the Pensionary, and probably of the other two. The substance of his letter was to inform the Marquis, that things might easily be disposed, so as to settle a correspondence between that crown and the republic, in order to renew the treaty of peace. That this could be done with the greater secrecy, because Monsieur Heinsius, by virtue of his oath as Pensionary, might keep any affair private as long as he thought necessary, and was not obliged to communicate it, until he believed things were ripe; and as long as he concealed it from his masters, he was not bound to discover it, either to the ministers of the Emperor, or those of her British Majesty. That since England thought it proper for King Charles to continue the whole campaign in Catalonia, (though he should be chosen emperor) in order to support the war in Spain, it was necessary for France to treat in the most secret manner with the States, who were not now so violently, as formerly, against having Philip on the Spanish throne, upon certain conditions for securing their trade, but were jealous of England's design to fortify some trading towns in Spain for themselves. That Heinsius, extremely desired {{to get out of the}} war for some reasons, which he (Petecum) was not permitted to tell; and that Vanderdussen and Buys were impatient to have the negotiations with France once more set on foot, which, if Monsieur Torcy thought fit to consent to, Petecum engaged that the States would determine to settle the preliminaries, in the midway between Paris and The Hague, with whatever ministers the Most Christian King should please to employ. But Monsieur Torcy refused this overture, and in his answer to Monsieur Petecum, assigned for the reason the treatment his master's former proposals had met with at The Hague and Gertruydenberg, from the ministers of Holland. Britain and Holland seemed pretty well agreed, that those proposals were too loose and imperfect to be a foundation for entering upon a general treaty; and Monsieur Gaultier was desired to signify to the French court, that it was expected they should explain themselves more particularly on the several articles.|$|E
