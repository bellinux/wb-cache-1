25|$|TEM {{specimen}} stage designs include airlocks {{to allow for}} insertion of the specimen holder into the vacuum with minimal loss of vacuum {{in other areas of}} the microscope. The specimen holders hold a standard size of sample grid or self-supporting specimen. Standard TEM grid sizes are 3.05mm diameter, with a thickness and mesh size ranging from a few to 100μm. The sample is placed onto the meshed area having a diameter of approximately 2.5mm. Usual grid materials are copper, molybdenum, gold or platinum. This grid is placed into the sample holder, which is paired with the {{specimen stage}}. A wide variety of designs of stages and holders exist, depending upon the type of experiment being performed. In addition to 3.05mm grids, 2.3mm grids are sometimes, if rarely, used. These grids were particularly used in the mineral sciences where a large degree of tilt can be required and where specimen material may be extremely rare. Electron transparent specimens have a thickness usually less than 100nm, but this value depends on the <b>accelerating</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E

Some of {{these can be}} a [...] combination of SEM, TEM and STEM in a single compact instrument. Low voltage increases image contrast which {{is especially important for}} biological specimens. This increase in contrast significantly reduces, or even eliminates the need to stain. Resolutions of a few nm are possible in TEM, SEM and STEM modes. The low energy of the electron beam means that permanent magnets can be used as lenses and thus a miniature column that does not require cooling can be used.|$|E
2500|$|In an EBPVD system, the {{deposition}} chamber must be evacuated to a pressure {{of at least}} 7.5 Torr (10−2 Pa) to allow passage of electrons from the electron gun to the evaporation material, which {{can be in the}} form of an ingot or rod. Alternatively, some modern EBPVD systems utilize an arc-suppression system and can be operated at vacuum levels as low as 5.0 Torr, for situations such as parallel use with magnetron sputtering. [...] Multiple types of evaporation materials and electron guns can be used simultaneously in a single EBPVD system, each having a power from tens to hundreds of kilowatts. Electron beams can be generated by thermionic emission, field electron emission or the anodic arc method. The generated electron beam is accelerated to a high kinetic energy and directed towards the evaporation material. Upon striking the evaporation material, the electrons will lose their energy very rapidly. The kinetic energy of the electrons is converted into other forms of energy through interactions with the evaporation material. The thermal energy that is produced heats up the evaporation material causing it to melt or sublimate. Once temperature and vacuum level are sufficiently high, vapor will result from the melt or solid. The resulting vapor can then be used to coat surfaces. Accelerating voltages can be between 3 and 40 kV. When the <b>accelerating</b> <b>voltage</b> is 20–25 kV and the beam current is a few amperes, 85% of the electron's kinetic energy can be converted into thermal energy. Some of the incident electron energy is lost through the production of X-rays and secondary electron emission.|$|E

With increasing bias, the usable amplitudes decrease continuously to the lowest Q-Loss level. In this fall-off region there is still a tuning factor up to 2 avail-able, with rf flux densities by at least a factor 1. 5 above the Q-Loss level. Measurements on small samples of the ferrite material used in the GSI cavities could be verified very well in the GSI SIS and ESR full-size cavities.
