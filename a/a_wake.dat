5|$|After the {{decision}} by the King County Superior Court to exempt the building from city preservation ordinances, the university applied for a demolition permit in May 2016. Demolition of the More Hall Annex began on July 19, and preservationists held <b>a</b> <b>wake</b> for the building with Daniel Streissguth, one of the project's original architects.|$|E
5|$|Both {{direct and}} {{indirect}} ways {{have been found to}} indicate the presence of <b>a</b> <b>wake</b> depression. The most direct is through the use of surface observations. Prior to the development of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, it was difficult to locate wake lows. With the advent of mesoscale networks, wake lows have become easier to detect. On weather satellite and weather radar imagery, wake lows and heat bursts normally occur on the rear side of a precipitation area. However, within larger precipitation areas, they can be located within the area showing a minimum of returns. When using velocity data from a WSR-88D doppler radar, high winds on the back edge of reflectivity data can give away the location of <b>a</b> <b>wake</b> low.|$|E

A mass commanded by priest Osvaldo Fernández was held on 14 July 2012 at the Parroquia San Juan de Apóstol, attended by about one thousand people.

5|$|A {{squall line}} (also {{known as a}} quasi-linear {{convective}} system or QLCS) is a line of thunderstorms forming along or ahead of a cold front. In the early 20th century, the term {{was used as a}} synonym for cold front. It contains heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, strong straight-line winds, and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts. Strong straight-line winds can occur where the squall line is {{in the shape of a}} bow echo. Tornadoes can occur along waves within a line echo wave pattern (LEWP), where mesoscale low-pressure areas are present. Some bow echoes which develop within the summer season are known as derechos, and they move quite fast through large sections of territory. On the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines, <b>a</b> <b>wake</b> low can be present, sometimes associated with a heat burst.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>wake</b> low, or wake depression, is a {{mesoscale}} low-pressure {{area which}} trails the mesoscale high following a squall line. Due to the subsiding warm air {{associated with the}} systems formation, clearing skies {{are associated with the}} wake low. Once difficult to detect in surface weather observations due to their broad spacing, the formation of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, has increased their detection. Severe weather, in the form of high winds, can be generated by the wake low when the pressure difference between the mesohigh preceding it and the wake low is intense enough. When the squall line {{is in the process of}} decay, heat bursts can be generated near the wake low. Once new thunderstorm activity along the squall line concludes, the wake low associated with it weakens in tandem.|$|E
25|$|A fit adult creates <b>a</b> <b>wake.</b> Drag due to <b>a</b> <b>wake</b> is Newtonian drag, {{increasing}} {{with the}} square of the velocity. For example, if the relative speed between the water and the leg is twice as high on the thrust phase than on the recovery phase, the thrust is four times as high as the drag. Assuming the legs are recovered with a relative speed between leg and body which amounts to the same as the relative speed between water and body, the legs must be kicked back with five times the mean velocity of the swimmer. This limits the top speed. Both effects together, velocity and frontal area, yield a thrust-to-drag ratio of 8 for the legs.|$|E

25|$|Treatment, {{a set of}} {{management}} techniques, is specific to DSPD. It is different from treatment of insomnia, and recognizes the patients' ability to sleep well on their own schedules, while addressing the timing problem. Success, if any, may be partial; for example, a patient who normally awakens at noon may only attain <b>a</b> <b>wake</b> time of 10 or 10:30 with treatment and follow-up. Being consistent with the treatment is paramount.|$|E

50|$|Waking dream technique: <b>A</b> <b>waking</b> {{dream is}} <b>a</b> level of consciousness, an {{original}} imaginative creation and {{a method of}} analysis and psychotherapy - {{all at the same}} time. <b>A</b> <b>waking</b> dream starts as a day dream and very quickly develops into a real dream. Comfortably lying down on a couch, the patient narrates his/her dream to the therapist while the therapist sits nearby noting it down. Soon, with the therapist's expert guidance it becomes a real dream, for the patient is not in control of what is going to appear, he/she cannot change images, and the dream can't be stopped by exercising will.|$|R
