A potential treatment option for fighting this bacterium is 'phage therapy', the clinical application of bacteriophages to selectively kill bacteria. Bacteriophage DLP 6 (vB_SmoM-DLP 6) was isolated from a soil sample using clinical isolate S. maltophilia strain D 1571 as host. Host range analysis of phage DLP 6 against 27 clinical S. maltophilia isolates shows successful infection and lysis in 13 of the 27 isolates tested. Transmission electron microscopy of DLP 6 indicates {{that it is a}} member of the Myoviridae family. Complete genome sequencing and analysis of DLP 6 reveals its richly recombined evolutionary history, featuring a core of both T 4 -like and cyanophage genes, which suggests that it {{is a member of the}} T 4 -superfamily.

40|$|The <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>bacterium</b> Staphylococcus aureus is a {{significant}} problem in hospitals and communities worldwide. Survival of the bacterium in the host is reliant on iron scavenging. Staphylococcus aureus has adopted specialized mechanisms for scavenging iron from the host. The cell wall and membrane-associated iron regulated surface determinant (Isd) proteins allow Staphylococcus aureus to scavenge iron from the heme in hemoglobin. There are nine Isd proteins (IsdH, IsdB, IsdA, IsdC, IsdE, IsdD, IsdF, IsdG and IsdI) located at different depths in the cell wall and membrane. Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) {{have been used to}} determine the direction, mechanistic details and heme binding ligands of the Isd heme transfer system. Ferric heme extracted from metHb by IsdB and has been demonstrated to transfer in a unidirectional fashion with the heme transferring along the pathway in the sequence (proximal amino acid) IsdB-N 2 (Tyr) - 3 ̆e IsdA-N (Tyr) - 3 ̆e IsdC-N (Tyr) - 3 ̆e IsdE (His) or, alternatively, when initiating from IsdH-N 3 (Tyr) the transfer sequence is - 3 ̆e IsdA-N (Tyr) - 3 ̆e IsdC-N (Tyr) - 3 ̆e IsdE (His). Heme transfer through the cell wall must occur through IsdC indicating that IsdC acts as the central conduit of the Isd system. MCD and ESI-MS data show that disruption of unidirectional heme transfer occurs with heme analogs and protein mutational studies. Finally kinetic analysis provides rate constants for the major unidirectional reaction steps...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInfections {{caused by}} multidrug {{resistant}} (MDR) bacteria {{are a major}} concern worldwide. Changes in membrane permeability, including decreased influx and/or increased efflux of antibiotics, are known as key contributors of bacterial MDR. Therefore, it is of critical importance to understand molecular mechanisms that link membrane permeability to MDR in order to design new antimicrobial strategies. In this work, we describe genotype-phenotype correlations in Enterobacter aerogenes, a clinically problematic and <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>bacterium.</b> To do this, series of clinical isolates have been periodically collected from two patients during chemotherapy with imipenem. The isolates exhibited different levels of resistance towards multiple classes of antibiotics, consistently with the presence or the absence of porins and efflux pumps. Transport assays were used to characterize membrane permeability defects. Simultaneous genome-wide analysis allowed the identification of putative mutations responsible for MDR. The genome of the imipenem-susceptible isolate G 7 was sequenced to closure and used as a reference for comparative genomics. This approach uncovered several loci that were specifically mutated in MDR isolates and whose products are known to control membrane permeability. These were omp 35 and omp 36, encoding the two major porins; rob, encoding a global AraC-type transcriptional activator; cpxA, phoQ and pmrB, encoding sensor kinases of the CpxRA, PhoPQ and PmrAB two-component regulatory systems, respectively.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Plant PathologyRevathi GovindClostridium difficile, a gram-positive, {{anaerobic}} bacterium, is a {{major cause}} of antibiotic-related diarrhea and pseudomembraneous colitis. In the last decades, C. difficile has emerged as a major threat because of its tendency to cause frequent and severe disease. Because of the severity of the infection and its high rate of recurrence, there is a significant financial burden on healthcare systems. Antibiotic treatments are a primary risk factor for the development of C. difficile infection because they disrupt the normal gut flora in the host, enabling the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>bacterium</b> to colonize the colon. Most of the resistance mechanisms in C. difficile reported to date can be classified as either antibiotic-degrading enzymes or modification of target sites. Another mechanism that can contribute to antibiotic resistance in C. difficile is the extrusion of antimicrobial compounds by efflux pumps. The goal of this project was to provide initial insights into the roles and mechanisms of a putative efflux pump complex. To do this, a number of experiments were designed to provide information about the structures, localization, and functions of this protein complex. It was determined that acidic pH conditions and a small number of antimicrobials, including inorganic compounds, organic compounds, fungicides, and antibiotics, inhibit growth of a C. difficile mutant lacking this pump system. Interestingly, higher NaCl in the medium and alkaline pH seem to promote the growth of a C. difficile mutant lacking this pump or, surprisingly, only inhibit growth of the wild type strain. The experiments performed in this project suggest that this efflux pump might have an essential role in C. difficile physiology, possibly by serving as an efflux pump for toxic metabolites...|$|E

One highly important application is measurement of DNA hybridisation to detect {{a wide range of}} clinically important phenomena, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), mutations and drug resistance genes. The use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for measurement of DNA hybridisation is well established for large electrodes but as yet remains relatively unexplored for microelectrodes due to difficulties associated with electrode functionalisation and impedimetric response interpretation. To shed light on this, microelectrodes were initially fabricated using photolithography and characterised electrochemically to ensure their responses matched established theory. Electrodes with different radii (50, 25, 15 and 5 µm) were then functionalised with a mixed film of 6 -mercapto- 1 -hexanol and a thiolated single stranded ssDNA capture probe for a specific gene from the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>bacterium</b> MRSA. The complementary oligonucleotide target from the mecA MRSA gene was hybridised with the surface tethered ssDNA probe. The EIS response was evaluated as a function of electrode radius and it was found that charge-transfer (RCT) was more significantly affected by hybridisation of the mecA gene than the non-linear resistance (RNL) which is associated with the steady state current. The discrimination of mecA hybridisation improved as electrode radius reduced with the RCT component of the response becoming increasingly dominant for smaller radii. It was possible to utilise these findings to produce a real time measurement of oligonucleotide binding where changes in RCT were evident one minute after nanomolar target addition. These data provide a systematic account of the effect of microelectrode radius on the measurement of hybridisation, providing insight into critical aspects of sensor design and implementation for the measurement of clinically important DNA sequences. The findings open up the possibility of developing rapid, sensitive DNA based measurements using microelectrodes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Treatment {{effectiveness}} of Helicobacter pylori varies regionally and is decreasing worldwide, principally {{as a result}} of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>bacterium.</b> Tetracycline is generally included in second line H. pylori eradication regimens. In Brazil, a high level of tetracycline resistance (TetR) is mainly associated with AGA 926 - 928 TTC 16 [*]S rDNA nucleotide substitutions. As H. pylori culture is fastidious, we investigated the primary occurrence of H. pylori 16 [*]S rDNA high level TetR genotype using a molecular approach directly on gastric biopsies of dyspeptic patients attending consecutively at Hospital das Clinicas of Marilia, São Paulo, Brazil. Methods Gastric biopsy specimens of 68 peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and 327 chronic gastritis (CG) patients with a positive histological diagnosis of H. pylori were investigated for TetR 16 [*]S rDNA genotype through a molecular assay based on amplification of a 16 [*]S rDNA 545 [*]bp fragment by polymerase chain reaction and H infI restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR/RFLP). Through this assay, AGA 926 - 928 TTC 16 [*]S rDNA TetR genotype resulted in a three DNA fragment restriction pattern (281, 227 and 37 [*]bp) and its absence originated two DNA fragments (264 and 281 [*]bp) due to a 16 [*]S rDNA conserved H inf I restriction site. Results The 545 [*]bp 16 [*]S rDNA PCR fragment was amplified from 90 % of gastric biopsies from histological H. pylori positive patients. H infI RFLP revealed absence of the AGA 926 – 928 TTC H. pylori genotype and PCR products of two patients showed absence of the conserved 16 [*]S rDNA H infI restriction site. BLASTN sequence analysis of four amplicons (two conserved and two with an unpredicted H infI restriction pattern) revealed a 99 % homology to H. pylori 16 [*]S rDNA from African, North and South American bacterial isolates. A nucleotide substitution abolished the conserved H infI restriction site in the two PCR fragments with unpredicted H infI RFLP, resulting in an E coRI restriction site. Conclusions H. pylori AGA 926 - 928 TTC 16 [*]S rDNA gene substitutions were not found in our population. More research is required to investigate if H. pylori TetR has a different genetic background in our region and if the nucleotide substitutions of the uncultured H. pylori 16 [*]S rRNA partial sequences have biological significance. </p...|$|E
