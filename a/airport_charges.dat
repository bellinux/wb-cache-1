The TTCI report notes Brazil's main weaknesses: its ground transport infrastructure remains underdeveloped (ranked 116th), {{with the quality of}} roads ranking in 105th place; and the country continues to suffer from a lack of price competitiveness (ranked 114th), due in part to high ticket taxes and <b>airport</b> <b>charges,</b> as well as high prices and high taxation.

25|$|By 2008, Flybe was Gatwick's third-largest airline (accounting for 9% of its slots) and its {{fastest-growing}} airline. It {{became the}} airport's largest domestic operator, carrying 1.2million passengers in its 2011–12 financial year on eight routes to destinations in the UK, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. In March 2013, the airline {{announced that it}} would end operations at Gatwick, citing unsustainably high <b>airport</b> <b>charges</b> and increases in UK Air Passenger Duty. Flybe sold its 25 pairs of daily slots at the airport to EasyJet for £20million. The latter's share of Gatwick slots increased to 44% in summer 2014; second-placed BA has held about 16% of the airport's slots since 2010. Following the sale of its Gatwick slots to EasyJet, Flybe continues to provide the scheduled service between Gatwick and Newquay, as a result of being awarded the contract to fly this route under a four-year Public Service Obligation (PSO).|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} the 2015 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI), which is a {{measurement}} {{of the factors that}} make it attractive to develop business in the travel and tourism industry of individual countries, Brazil ranked in the 28st place at the world's level, third in the Americas, after Canada and United States. Brazil main competitive advantages are its natural resources, which ranked 1st on this criteria out of all countries considered, and ranked 23rd for its cultural resources, due to its many World Heritage sites. The 2013 TTCI report also notes Brazil's main weaknesses: its ground transport infrastructure remains underdeveloped (ranked 129th), with the quality of roads ranking in the 121st place, and quality of air transport infrastructure in 131st; and the country continues to suffer from a lack of price competitiveness (ranked 126th), due in part to high and increasing ticket taxes and <b>airport</b> <b>charges,</b> as well as high and rising prices more generally. Safety and security improved significantly between 2008 and 2013, moving from 128th to 73rd place, before slipping to 106th by 2017.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a public and congested airport served by airlines {{that may have}} market power, and two types of travelers with different relative values of time.

As a result, the socially efficient <b>airport</b> <b>charge</b> can be substantially higher than what we learned from the recent literature on congestion pricing with non-atomistic airlines.

50|$|While the <b>airport</b> <b>charges</b> no {{landing fees}} for visiting aircraft, {{a number of}} hazards exist which make Caboolture {{challenging}} for pilots who are unfamiliar with the facilities.

50|$|To reduce {{noise from}} thrust {{reversal}} during aircraft landings, the runways were built to {{a length of}} 4,000 meters, however the noise reduction is offset by increased taxiing times. To reduce noise pollution, a hall for engine testing was built. After 11pm engine tests may be carried out only {{with the approval of}} air traffic control. To motivate airlines to use low-noise aircraft, the <b>airport</b> <b>charges</b> are calculated according to the level of noise pollution.

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{literature}} on airport congestion pricing by allowing carriers to price-discriminate between the business and leisure passengers when operating costs are {{the same for all}} passengers. The main results are: First, the second-best discriminating business fare exceeds the first-best uniform fare (which equals the external part of the marginal congestion costs), while the second-best discriminating leisure fare is lower than the first-best uniform fare. Second, the optimal <b>airport</b> <b>charge</b> implements the first-best uniform or second-best discriminating fares. Importantly, this charge can always be higher than what would be expected when all passengers were treated as having the same time valuation. This result provides some support to the finding that the welfare losses associated with an atomistic <b>airport</b> congestion <b>charge</b> may be low. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|None of the airport-pricing {{studies have}} {{differentiated}} the congestion incurred in the terminals from the congestion incurred on the runways. This paper models and connects the {{two kinds of}} congestion in one joint model. This is done by adopting a deterministic bottleneck model for the terminal to describe passengers' behavior, and a simpler static congestion model for the runway. We find that different from the results obtained in the literature, uniform airfare does not yield the first-best outcome when terminal congestion is explicitly taken into account. In particular, business passengers are at first-best charged a higher fare than leisure passengers {{if and only if}} their relative schedule-delay cost is higher. We further identify circumstances under which passengers are, given a uniform <b>airport</b> <b>charge</b> scheme, under- or over-charged with respect to the terminal charge. Furthermore, when concession surplus is added to the analysis, the airport may raise (rather than reduce) the <b>airport</b> <b>charge</b> in order to induce more business passengers who in turn will lengthen leisure passengers' dwell time and hence increase their chance of purchasing concession goods. Finally, the impacts of terminal capacity expansion and time-varying terminal fine toll are discussed. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R
