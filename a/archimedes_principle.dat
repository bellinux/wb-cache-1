Estimation of bone density using existing methods in experimental models has its advantages as well as drawbacks. Materials and methods: In this study, the X-ray histogram edge detection technique was used to estimate the bone mass density in ovariectomized rats treated orally with germinated brown rice (GBR) bioactives, {{and the results were}} compared with estimated results obtained using <b>Archimede’s</b> <b>principle.</b> New bone cell proliferation was assessed by histology and immunohistochemical reaction using polyclonal nuclear antigen. Additionally, serum alkaline phosphatase activity, serum and bone calcium and zinc concentrations were detected using a chemistry analyzer and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Rats were divided into groups of six as follows: sham (nonovariectomized, nontreated); ovariectomized, nontreated; and ovariectomized and treated with estrogen, or Remifemin®, GBR-phenolics, acylated steryl glucosides, gamma oryzanol, and gamma amino-butyric acid extracted from GBR at different doses. Results: Our results indicate a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, serum and bone calcium, and zinc and ash content in the treated groups compared with the ovariectomized nontreated group (P < 0. 05). Bone density increased significantly (P < 0. 05) in groups treated with estrogen, GBR, Remifemin®, and gamma oryzanol compared to the ovariectomized nontreated group. Histological sections revealed more osteoblasts in the treated groups when compared with the untreated groups. A polyclonal nuclear antigen reaction showing proliferating new cells was observed in groups treated with estrogen, Remifemin®, GBR, acylated steryl glucosides, and gamma oryzanol. There was a good correlation between bone mass densities estimated using <b>Archimede’s</b> <b>principle</b> and the edge detection technique between the treated groups (r 2 = 0. 737, P = 0. 004). Conclusion: Our study shows that GBR bioactives increase bone density, which might be via the activation of zinc formation and increased calcium content, and that X-ray edge detection technique is effective in the measurement of bone density and can be employed effectively in this respect.

The process was initially set up to produce dense ceramics, andwill be adapted in a second stage {{to the formation of}} cellular solids {{with the addition of a}} pore forming agent (poly(ethylene)), which decomposes during thermal treatment at high temperature, leaving calibrated porosities. Commercial ZrO 2 powders (Tosoh TZ- 3 Y and TZ- 3 YS, 3 mol % Y 2 O 3) as a ceramic material and gelatine as a gelling agent were employed. Selected powders were preliminary characterised by Transmission Electron Microscopy (BF and SADP), in order to acquire information about size distribution and microstructure. The first step of the work was the optimisation of the zirconia suspension with respect to its stability, because while the gelling process is occurring there should be no powder sedimentation. The best results were obtained bywith dispersing the powders in distilled water under natural pH (ca. 4. 7) and after 10 minutes of sonication by means of an u. s. probe, as evidenced by laser granulometry. Then, slurries with varying solid/liquid ratios and various amounts of gelatine were prepared. The influence of the dispersion method, of the temperature of gelatine dissolution and of casting, gelation and drying conditions were studied. In particular, an increase of the viscosity of the suspension was observed with the TZ- 3 Y powder, which made the casting very difficult, then this powder was given up. The best results were reached with a solid content of 50 wt% and a gelatine content of 3 wt. % respect to the water amount. Knoop micro-hardness technique, performed on a section carefully cut and polished, was used to investigate the effectiveness of the drying phase: differences in hardness between surface and core were found, possibly as a consequence of differential drying rate which involves an internal gradient of density, useful for an effective comparison between different drying procedures. Density measurements by <b>Archimede’s</b> <b>principle</b> on fired samples at 1400 °C for 1 hour indicated that it was possible to reach at least 95 % t. d [...] Then, poly(ethylene) granules (125 - 300 microns) were added to create porosities inside the gel cast pieces (50 vol. %). The thermal cycle was set up to allow the polymer to decompose, without foam collapsing prior to high temperature sintering. Dense products were machined to the final standard size of 10 x 30 mm for cylinders and 4 x 3 x 50 mm for prismatic bars, obtaining parallel planar surfaces and removing surface defects such as voids and irregular profiles. Samples were tested for mechanical properties by means of Instron 8033 (200 kN) and Zwick Roell Z 010 (10 kN) electromechanical testing machines.
