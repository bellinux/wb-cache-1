5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of <b>American</b> <b>eel,</b> Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E

25|$|Prince Edward Island {{used to have}} native moose, bear, caribou, wolf, {{and other}} larger species. Due to hunting and habitat {{disruption}} these species are no longer found on the island. Some species common to P.E.I. are red foxes, coyote, blue jays, and robins. Skunks and raccoons are common non-native species. Species at risk in P.E.I. include piping plovers, <b>american</b> <b>eel,</b> bobolinks, little brown bat, and beach pinweed.|$|E
25|$|Jamaican waters contain {{considerable}} {{resources of}} fresh-and saltwater fish. The chief varieties of saltwater fish are kingfish, jack, mackerel, whiting, bonito, and tuna. Fish that occasionally enter freshwater and estuarine environments include snook, jewfish, mangrove snapper, and mullets. Fish that spend {{the majority of}} their lives in Jamaica's fresh waters include many species of livebearers, killifish, freshwater gobies, the mountain mullet, and the <b>American</b> <b>eel.</b> Tilapia have been introduced from Africa for aquaculture, and are very common.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the site}} {{primarily}} contained human remains, {{there were a}} few artifacts found as well. Items found included a ceramic pipe fragment, a complete ceramic effigy pipe, several ceramic vessel sherds, and a shattered piece of chert. Of the artifacts, the best preserved was the ceramic effigy pipe, which was designed and decorated to symbolize a turtle. A variety of animal bones (both aquatic and mammalian) were also found. The species identified included Atlantic salmon, <b>American</b> <b>eel,</b> mouse (either deer mouse or white-footed mouse), and a bear. There were also several fish bones that were either tentatively identified or unidentifiable.|$|E

40|$|<b>American</b> <b>eels</b> (Anguilla rostrata) {{harvested}} from weirs by the commercial fisheries ofthree Nova Scotian rivers differed in life history characteristics. Depending upon their orientation,weirs captured either downstream-migrating silver <b>American</b> <b>eels</b> or upstream-migrating yellowAmerican eels. Mean lengths and weights of downstream-migrating <b>American</b> <b>eels</b> differedamong rivers, increasing as the run progressed from late August to mid-November. Sexuallymaturing (silver) migrants were larger (typically exceeding 400 mm in length) and older thanimmature nonmigrants {{and had a}} higher ovarian gonadosomatic index (proportion of body weightcontributed by ovaries; usually above 1. 5 %). At a given length, silver eels had larger eyediameterindices (eye width x eye height) than did yellow eels but, for silver eels, eye index wasnot a predictor of gonadosomatic index. Silver eels migrating later in the run were more mature(had higher gonadosomatic indices) than those migrating earlier. Silver eels from different riverswere similar in age and gonadosomatic index. Male silver eels were smaller, less mature, andmigrated earlier than did most females. Skin coloration (yellow-silver) was a fairly reliable guide tosexual maturity (immature-maturing), but histologically detectable maturation may begin one ormore years prior to coloration change and participation in the spawning migration...|$|R
25|$|Because of its {{connection}} with Flushing Bay, several fish species native to marine habitats regularly swim into and inhabit Meadow and Willow Lakes. Fish species native to Meadow Lake include <b>American</b> <b>eel,</b> Largemouth bass, Northern snakehead (an invasive species), and White mullet. Willow Lake {{is named for}} the many species of Willow plants which inhabit the area. Invasive Phragmites are also abundant. Attempts to kill the phragmites with pesticides have led to further fish kill. Numerous berry-producing trees and shrubs near Willow Lake attract several migratory bird species. The biodiversity of the lakes {{has been found to}} be much lower than other water bodies of comparable size.|$|E
500|$|Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{rates the}} river's last [...] as an {{impaired}} water body.

40|$|Eight hundred twenty nine yellow-phase <b>American</b> <b>eels</b> (Anguilla rostrata), 160 - 740 mmtotal length (TL), were electrofished from 10 {{stations}} in the Annaquatucket River, Rhode Island. The eels were individually marked with liquid-nitrogen-cooled brands and released at the site ofcollection. Resampling yielded 200 recaptures (24 %); eels were recaptured at 8 of the 10 stationsafter 1 year. Of all recaptures, 174 (87 %) were from the station of release, indicating restrictedmovement by <b>American</b> <b>eels</b> from the collection sites. Stations associated with dams had higherrecapture rates, {{but there was no}} significant relationship between percent recaptured and eeldensity, station size, or distance upriver. An annual growth rate (mean SE) of 29. 9 4. 7 mm/yearfor all <b>American</b> <b>eels</b> was estimated for a 214 -d growing season. The growth rate for eels longerthan 399 mm TL, which have previously been shown to be female was 62. 10 14. 9 mm/year, 2. 3 times greater than for eels less than 400 mm. Mean growth rates {{do not appear to be}} a functionof distance upriver or density but are more closely related to the sex ratio of eels at the station. Comparison of these growth rates with other published growth rates suggests that both sex ratioand latitude are important factors influencing the growth rate of a given population...|$|R
