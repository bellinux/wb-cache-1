25|$|For the 12 seasons (1984–96) {{prior to}} the Phantoms' founding, the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Philadelphia Flyers had {{maintained}} a highly-successful affiliation with the AHL's oldest franchise, the Hershey Bears, which included a Calder Cup title in 1988. In September 1996, however, the Flyers left their long-time home arena, the Spectrum, and moved <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> into the soon-to-be-completed CoreStates Center. Instead of demolishing the Spectrum, Comcast Spectacor, the owner of both arenas {{as well as the}} Flyers, elected to keep it open and active, but doing so would require a tenant to fill the 80 to 100 NHL and National Basketball Association (NBA) dates the Spectrum would lose to the CoreStates Center.|$|E

Kloss and McMillan played both mixed doubles set for the Golden Gaters and split them winning 12 games and losing 12. The Golden Gaters drew 4,012 fans for their opener at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Arena. <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot,</b> the {{defending}} two-time World Champion Oakland Athletics were playing the Baltimore Orioles at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum and drew only 2,980 fans in head-to-head competition with the Golden Gaters {{for the attention of}} sports fans.|$|E

2500|$|In the Eastern Conference Finals, Carolina met the heavily-favored Toronto Maple Leafs. In Game 6 in Toronto, the Leafs' Mats Sundin {{tied the}} game with 22 seconds {{remaining}} {{to send it to}} overtime, where Carolina's Martin Gelinas would score to send the franchise to their first Stanley Cup Finals appearance. During this series, several Hurricanes fan traditions drew hockey-wide media attention for the first time: fans met the team at the airport on the return from every road trip, and echoed football-season habits honed for games <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> by hosting massive tailgate parties before each home game, a relative novelty in the cold-weather-centric NHL.

50|$|Directed by Zack Snyder. A {{group of}} strangers: Ana, Police Sergeant Kenneth Hall, Michael, Andre and his {{pregnant}} wife, Luda, {{break into a}} nearby mall where they are confronted by three living guards - C.J., Bart and Terry - who make them surrender their weapons in exchange for refuge. The group secures the mall, then heads to the roof where they see another survivor, Andy, who is stranded alone in his gun store, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> zombie-infested <b>parking</b> <b>lot.</b> <b>The</b> next day more survivors arrive at the mall and are let in. After some of the survivors start dying from zombie attacks and any hope of being rescued gone, the group decides to fight {{their way to the}} Milwaukee marina and travel on Steve's yacht to an island on Lake Michigan.|$|R

Snodgrass gets propelled into a drainage ditch, taking hours to die from internal bleeding. The situation worsens when the diner's power goes out. The counterman instructs the survivors that {{they will need to}} consume the perishable meats and collect good potable water from the restrooms. While the employee's restroom is inside the diner, the men's and ladies' room are by the outdoor gas station, and the narrator's attempt to gather fresh water from those places nearly costs him his life when the trucks realize what he is trying to do.|$|R

40|$|Printed on {{recycled}} paper Collaborative {{studies by the}} City of Austin and the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) have identified coal-tar based sealcoat—the black, shiny emulsion painted or sprayed on asphalt pavement such as parking lots—as a major and previously unrecognized source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-bon (PAH) contamination. Several PAHs are suspected human carcinogens and are toxic to aquatic life. Studies in Austin, Texas, showed that particles in runoff from coal-tar based sealcoated <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> had concentrations of PAHs that were about 65 times higher than concentrations in particles washed off <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> {{that had not been}} sealcoated. Biological studies, conducted by the City of Austin in the field and in the laboratory, indicated that PAH levels in sediment contami-nated with abraded sealcoat were toxic to aquatic life and were degrading aquatic communities, as indicated by loss of species and decreased numbers of organisms. Identification of this source of PAHs may help to improve future strategies for controlling these compounds in urban water bodies <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Nation where <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> sealcoat is used.
