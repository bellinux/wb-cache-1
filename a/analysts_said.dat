The decision by RWE npower and E.ON follows uncertainty over nuclear energy following the Fukushima nuclear disaster last year. The companies will not proceed with their Horizon project, which was to develop nuclear reactors at Wylfa in North Wales and at Oldbury-on-Severn in Gloucestershire.

25|$|The KAI-KF-X {{project had}} a long history of delays and postponements since it was first {{announced}} in March 2001 by South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung After several failed attempts to get the Philippines, Sweden, Turkey, the UAE and the United States to join the project, it was only in June 2010 that South Korea suceeded to get Indonesia joined the project, the only country to be a JV partner. However three years later, on March 1, 2013, South Korea postponed the project on hold for 18 months, due to financial and the election of the new South Korean President Park Geun-hye. Indonesia had since paid $165 million of the then DAPA’s estimated 6 billion won (US5.5 billion).

Pasi Saukkonen, {{a political scientist at the}} University of Helsinki, made a comparison between similar EU referendums in Denmark and Ireland (following which a similar referendum passed the measure, though it was in turn followed by a similar proposed measure) where the smaller EU member states wielded immense influence; though he said that such controversial matters usually work out in the end.|$|E
