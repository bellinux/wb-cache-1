5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board.

Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
