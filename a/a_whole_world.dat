25|$|Between 1972 and 1991, 29 {{volcanic}} eruptions were recorded, mostly on Java. The two most violent {{volcanic eruptions}} {{in modern times}} occurred in Indonesia; in 1815 Mount Tambora in Sumbawa erupted killing 92,000 people. Tambora produced the largest eruption known on the planet during the past 10,000 years. Also the eruption created an umbrella of volcanic ash which spread and blanketed Southeast Asia, plunging it into darkness for a week, and made <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> without a summer in 1815. The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa {{was one of the}} deadliest and most destructive volcanic events in recorded history. Nearly 40,000 deaths are attributed to the eruption itself and the tsunamis it created. Significant additional effects were also felt around the world {{in the days and weeks}} after the volcano's destruction.|$|E

In the world below, they discover a warlock named Xande, one of three apprentices to the legendary Archmage Noah, is trying to possess the crystals of light, so as to bring forth chaos and disorder. The four warriors eventually arrive at the Crystal Tower where they discover that the Cloud of Darkness {{is the source of the}} recent events. The Cloud attempts to create a similar situation to the Flood of Light a millennia earlier so that the world is pulled into the void. The Light Warriors traverse into the domain of the dark crystals to free the imprisoned Dark Warriors and defeat the Cloud of Darkness, thereby restoring the crystals and balance to the world. In the DS remake, there are also several [...] "side quests" [...] that can also be completed.|$|E

Commenting on the Christ comparison, Pullman felt that his character {{was sort of the}} [...] "doppelganger of Jesus or something." [...] He stated of Danes: [...] "It's like he's been out in the desert, and he comes back in, and there is a certain kind of way in which he still has pride." [...] SFX described Oswald's journey as one from a Hannibal Lecter type character to a Billy Graham or messianic figure. Pullman observed that Oswald's failure to die [...] "becomes the pivot for <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> that has changed"; feeling that his character was an intelligent one who knows he can provide a message people want to hear. Discussing Oswald's fall from grace, series writer Jane Espenson explains that [...] "humanity doesn't seize on heroes for the long–term", and that Oswald's descent from fame was a way to make his arc more realistic. Though Oswald dies helping the Torchwood team, Espenson remarked that [...] "we didn't want to outright redeem this horrible, horrible man" [...] commenting that his death is intended as [...] "redemption and comeuppance both." [...] The Independents Neela Debnath observed that whilst {{the character of}} Danes had [...] "become likeable in an odd-sort of way" [...] his last scenes [...] "reiterated just how despicable he was" [...] and that it was the right time for him to depart the cast.|$|E

Although I like rock and roll and modern music, the first time my granddad played me the Mills Brothers, something magical happened. The lyrics were so romantic, so real, the way a song should be for me. It was like seeing my future flash before me. I wanted to be a singer and I knew that this was the music that I wanted to sing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch {{read the}} words of [...] "And surely your blood of your lives will I require," [...] to support the {{proposition}} that one who commits suicide is considered an evildoer of the highest degree. For God created {{the world for a}} single individual, Adam, so anyone who destroys a soul destroys <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world.</b> The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch therefore taught that Jews should not carry out for one who committed suicide anything to honor that person, but Jews should bury the body after cleansing and dressing it in a shroud. The principle is that everything for honoring the living relatives should be done for them, as opposed to for the honor of the person who committed suicide.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his regular classes, when Fick could generate enough interest and time, he would offer a rare elective college course on the college level, World Literature. [...] He limited {{the size of the}} class and required massive readings. Through this course Fick opened up <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> of literature which his students continued to enjoy into the 21st Century. [...] The class was so good that students were still referring to their notes more than 40 years later for new things to read when they developed the literary version of the attitude Fick warned them against with the German phrase, [...] "Ich hab schon alles gesehen." [...] (literally, [...] "I have already all things seen"). As late as 2007, one former Fick student reported that next to his bedside table was Gösta Berling's Saga by Selma Lagerlöf, who in 1909 became the first woman and the first Swede to win the Nobel Prize for literature.|$|E
2500|$|The Book of Bebb tetralogy {{proved to}} be one of Buechner's most {{well-known}} works. Published in the years from 1972–1977, it brought Buechner to a much wider audience, and gained him critical acclaim (Lion Country, the first book in the series, was a finalist for the National Book Award in 1971). Of writing the series, Buechner says: [...] "I had never known a man like Leo Bebb and was in most ways quite unlike him myself, but despite that, there was very little I had to do by way of consciously, purposefully inventing him. He came, unexpected and unbidden, from a part of myself no less mysterious and inaccessible than the part where dreams come from; and little by little there came with him <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> of people and places that was as heretofore unknown to me as Bebb was himself." [...] In this series, Buechner experimented {{for the first time with}} first-person narrative, and discovered that this, too, opened new doors. His next work, Godric, published in 1980, was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Godric, a 12th-century English saint, tells his story in the first-person, and Buechner took great care to recreate the sounds and rhythm of his speech.|$|E
2500|$|One for All was a {{critical}} success upon its release. Los Angeles Times writer Steve Hochman called it [...] "an impressive debut" [...] and commended [...] "the power of the lessons delivered with style and creativity", stating [...] "There's a playful ease to this record recalling the colorful experiments of De La Soul, and there's as much sexual boasting as Islamic teaching." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times described the album as [...] "a peculiar merger of sexual boasting, self-promotion and occasional political perspective." [...] J the Sultan of The Source gave it the publication's maximum five-mike rating and wrote that it [...] "overflows with creativity, originality, and straight-up talent. [...] the type of record that captures <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> of music, rhymes and vibes with a completely new style." [...] In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau gave On for All an A- rating, indicating [...] "the kind of garden-variety good record that is the great luxury of musical micromarketing and overproduction. Anyone open to its aesthetic will enjoy {{more than half its}} tracks." [...] He commented that [...] "most black-supremacist rap sags under the burden of its belief system just like any other ideological music," [...] but quipped, [...] "This Five Percenter daisy-age is warm, good-humored, intricately interactive—popping rhymes every sixth or eighth syllable, softening the male chauvinism and devil-made-me-do-it with soulful grooves and jokes fit for a couch potato." ...|$|E
