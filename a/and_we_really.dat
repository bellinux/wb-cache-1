500|$|When the Pam {{character}} discusses her impressive volleyball ability, {{she says}} she played volleyball in junior high, senior high, college and went to volleyball camps most summers. However, in the episode [...] "Job Fair", she said her high school gym brings back memories of her faking PMS {{to get out of}} playing basketball and volleyball. Writer Jen Celotta acknowledged this was a continuity error: [...] "Yeah, we screwed up. I didn't remember that she said that, specifically about volleyball. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> do try to be careful about those things." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding the Wizard of Oz references, Underwood {{commented that}} [...] "it {{was all about}} having subtle references," [...] such as the plaid shirt and red shoes she wore on the video. When asked if her aim was to {{generate}} controversy with the storyline, the singer {{said that it was}} not what she were aiming for at all, adding: [...] "I try to stay away from controversy in any form or fashion. It was just such a great story and such a mini-movie, listening to the song, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> wanted to do it justice in the video." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 12, 2017, Flames {{president}} Ken King {{stated that}} the team was no longer pursuing the arena, as [...] "we've been working {{for a long time}} {{trying to come up with}} a formula that really works to replace this building <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> put our best foot forward and I’ve come to the conclusion sadly and I’m very disappointed that I don't think we can make a deal that works for us". [...] Mayor Naheed Nenshi subsequently proposed a partnership wherein portions of the cost of [...] "plan B" [...] would be covered by the city, and the rest covered by the team ownership and user surcharges. King objected to this proposal.|$|E

500|$|Following the Volume 4 world tour, Black Sabbath {{returned}} to Los Angeles {{to begin work}} on their next release. Pleased with the Volume 4 album, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and {{returned to}} the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles. With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a [...] "giant synthesiser". The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. [...] "Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on Volume 4 <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> got discontent" [...] Iommi said. [...] "Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something. I just couldn't think of anything. And if I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything." ...|$|E
500|$|During Brown's premiership, in October 2008, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) {{recommended}} to the then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that cannabis remain {{classified as a}} Class C drug. Acting {{against the advice of}} the Council, she chose to reclassify it as Class B. After Professor David Nutt, the chair of the ACMD, criticised this move in a lecture in 2009, he was asked to step down by then Home Secretary Alan Johnson. Following his resignation, Professor Nutt said Brown had [...] "made up his mind" [...] to reclassify cannabis despite evidence to the contrary. Brown had argued, [...] "I don't think that the previous studies took into account that so much of the cannabis on the streets is now of a lethal quality <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> have got to send out a message to young people—this is not acceptable". Professor Nutt's predecessor at the ACMD, Sir Michael Rawlins, later said, [...] "Governments may well have good reasons for taking an alternative view... When that happens, then the government should explain why it's ignoring the particular advice".|$|E
500|$|In a 2011 Q, {{producer}} Jim Lemley {{said that}} [...] "Wanted 2 {{sounds like it}} will not happen any time soon if at all". That same year, James McAvoy said, regarding the sequel, [...] "I think the studio is keen to make it, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> want to make it, {{but we want to}} make it if it's right and when it's right, and that might not be ever." [...] McAvoy also expressed interest in a sequel focusing on a character other than Wesley. Universal later brought Wanted screenwriters Michael Brandt and Derek Haas to write the sequel, which Haas described as happening [...] "right after the events that just happened; it'll pick up Wesley a few years later and go back in for another round", while also being [...] "Fox-less and loom-less." [...] Haas would later detail that the script featured a new female protagonist, who Wesley would recruit [...] "sort of in the Fox role." [...] Bekmambetov declared during the interviews for [...] that after many years of indecision as the Wanted sequel stalled in development, he proposed an idea to the screenwriters wherein the plot followed Wesley while featuring [...] "a great twist." ...|$|E

[...] "Take a Bow" [...] was offered {{for use in the}} episode at a reduced licensing rate, something which surprised Murphy, who believed {{he would not be able}} to secure the rights to the song. He stated: [...] "Usually, people who have no. 1 hits, even if they give it to you, want hundreds of thousands of dollars, in my experience. But Rihanna gave it to us for a really good price. That's been one of the cool and surprising things about this experience, that these people that the cast <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> admire and respect have found out about the show and are supportive." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill." [...] During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: [...] "It used to bother me. I would try and keep a steady course with it, and now I can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally {{happy to have a}} blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a sudden}} it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood is, and I have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. I have never had that much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From my point of view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that just came out of her pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 2001, {{six months}} after the album's release, Skunkhour disbanded, {{frustrated}} by a lack of support from Universal, which was experiencing upheavals in Australia. Aya told Ritchie Yorke of The Sunday Mail that the difficulties with the label meant the band was unable to maximise its opportunities. He said: [...] "We decided that we'd rather move on now and look at some other possibilities while we're still drawing big crowds ... Unfortunately, the last album was only heard on Triple J and some community stations, so we didn't really reach the mainstream with it. This was despite our hopes that the album might have taken us to another level. It was given great reviews <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> thought the music got us back in touch with the fans.

[...] To promote safe sex, U2 sold condoms bearing the album title Achtung Baby at their Zoo TV Tour concerts. The cover of the single release is a photograph by David Wojnarowicz. The photograph depicts buffaloes falling off a cliff after being chased by Native American hunters.
