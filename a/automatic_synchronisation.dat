50|$|Because digital clocks can be {{very small}} and {{inexpensive}} devices that enhance the popularity of product designs, they are often incorporated into all kinds of devices such as cars, radios, televisions, microwave ovens, standard ovens, computers and cell phones. Sometimes their usefulness is disputed: a common complaint is that when time has to be set to Daylight Saving Time, many household clocks have to be readjusted. The incorporation of <b>automatic</b> <b>synchronisation</b> by a radio time signal is reducing this problem (see Radio clock).|$|E

40|$|Presents MARTI (Man-machine Animation Real-Time Interface) {{for simple}} {{interfacing}} to virtual environments. The {{system is designed}} for automated special-effect animation and human-computer interaction, and can immerse people, irrespective of their expertise, into new technologies. Previous research has used image recognition systems to extract control signals for lip synchronisation; however, the analysis requires that the key articulatory points be highlighted. Researchers have also considered acoustic soundtracks. However, these systems are limited by the accuracy of their speech recognition and must be trained on the single animator's voice. Furthermore, they do not provide timing information, which prevents accurate synchronisation. MARTI overcomes these limitations, allowing <b>automatic</b> lip <b>synchronisation</b> from a single speech input, and without the normal constraints of head-sets, reflectors and complex puppeteer control hardware. The system achieves a lip synchronisation performance in excess of 81 % and does not require pre-training to the performer's voice, but instead operates with continuous speech in `normal' non-laboratory conditions. Furthermore, the system returns timing information, and is invariant to regional accents and dialects, race, age and gender. MARTI introduces novel research {{from a number of}} engineering fields in order to realise the first natural interface and animation system to be capable of high performance for real users and real-world applications...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{extensively}} explores, for {{the first}} time, the technical feasibility and performance of real-time end-to-end optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OOFDM) transmission systems by implementing {{field programmable gate array}} (FPGA) -based OOFDM transceivers incorporating entirely self-developed digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms. Commercially available 4 GS/s, 8 quantization-bit digital-to-analogue (DAC) and analogue-to-digital converters (ADC) are utilised in the transceivers and low-cost intensity modulation and direct detection (IMDD) transmission systems are also employed for all transmission systems as the research focuses on cost-sensitive access and inbuilding networks. A series of world–first and world-only, real-time, end-to-end OOFDM transmission systems were achieved. The initial DQPSK-based transceiver designs demonstrated first a 1. 5 Gb/s and subsequently a 3 Gb/s net bit rate over 500 m multi-mode fibres (MMFs). Thorough enhancement of the transceiver‟s DSP design, 16 -quadrature amplitude modulation (16 -QAM) with additional DSP features achieved a 6 Gb/s net bit rate over 300 m MMF, followed by an 11. 25 Gb/s line rate over 500 m MMFs and 25 km standard single-mode fibres (SSMFs) /MetroCore™ SMFs due to the utilisation of 64 -QAM with more advanced DSP functions. The use of different intensity modulators, as alternatives to the initial DFB-based directly modulated laser (DML), was explored. A colourless OOFDM transceiver was demonstrated at 7. 5 Gb/s line rate over 25 km SSMF using a 1 GHz reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) as an intensity modulator. To further reduce the transceiver cost, a low-cost VCSEL-based DML was successfully employed at 11. 25 Gb/s over 25 km SSMF. To achieve a fully autonomous OOFDM receiver a synchronous clocking technique was proposed and experimentally demonstrated at 11. 25 Gb/s over 25 km SSMF without degradation in system performance. Over the same IMDD systems, a versatile, highly accurate, performance penalty-free solution for <b>automatic</b> symbol <b>synchronisation</b> was also proposed and experimentally demonstrated using DC offset signalling. This research is a significant milestone in proving the technical feasibility of OOFDM for practical applications in future access and in-building networks...|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the design and {{realisation}} of system for automatic evaluation of e-mail messages. The system works with PHP language and MySQL database. It also allows <b>automatic</b> <b>synchronisation.</b> During the synchronisation e-mail messages are downloaded and saved using IMAP or POP 3 protocol. Subsequently, the messages are analysed. During the analysis the reports are classified into types, according to pre-defined keywords. The system also works with black lists and white lists. If the sender of an e-mail is during the synchronisation found in the blacklist, that e-mail will be skipped. On the contrary, if the sender of an e-mail is found within the white list, that e-mail will be excluded from keyword matching and from the list is type and category loaded. Most of the values from the carried out evaluation of the e-mails can be clearly seen in advanced statistics. Pie charts and numerical statistics are available.

40|$|Effective {{collaboration}} is fundamental in fast changing environments such as emergencies. Emergency management (EM) requires timely and accurate {{information from a}} range of stakeholders to ensure adequate response. Problems arising from poor communication and lack of information sharing between disaster management groups can {{have a negative impact on}} response. For remote EM practitioners, a lack of resources combined with the large geographic areas affected by disasters can make effective EM response even more challenging. Modern technologies and advances in networking can provide new methods for sharing real-time information about a disaster with stakeholders regardless of their location. Thus, research should investigate methods for making this technology available for remote EM practitioners. This thesis aims to develop a research artefact that meets the needs of remote EM practitioners for collaborative report writing tasks. The research methodology employed throughout the thesis to achieve this aim is Design Science. First, a survey of EM practitioners from remote Northwest Queensland (QLD) investigated their current information sharing and report writing practices. Limitations of current practices were identified, including the duplication of effort and the difficulty in sharing information with diverse stakeholders. It was also demonstrated that EM practitioners in remote Northwest QLD are interested in utilising collaborative technologies to improve information sharing both within and between organisations. The results of the survey derive several key features that should be supported in such systems, including support for real-time <b>synchronisation,</b> <b>automatic</b> convergence of information, flexible locking, user attribution, maintaining report history, as well as support for collaboration with users in the field. Based on the findings of the survey of remote EM practitioners, an artefact was developed iteratively following the principles of Design Science. A comparison of text synchronisation algorithms demonstrated that the Differential Synchronisation technique (diffsync) was most suited for supporting synchronisation in remote EM, due to its natural convergence and robustness to poor network environments. However diffsync lacked support for several of the features suggested by the EM community. Thus, the development of the artefact focused on new techniques and frameworks for achieving flexible locking, user attribution, multi-synchronous editing and crowdsourcing within the diffsync technique. These features combined with diffsync provided a toolkit for developing collaborative EM report writing tools. To determine whether the artefact met the needs of the remote EM practitioners, it was subjected to several Design Science evaluation methods. These methods included benchmarking, a static analysis based on groupware heuristics, and the instantiation of a prototype. This instantiation was subject to additional evaluations with the target EM community, including a comparison study, a technology acceptance study, and an enhanced cognitive walkthrough. The results of these evaluations determined that the artefact meets the needs specified by the remote EM practitioners surveyed earlier in the study. The outcome of this thesis has many contributions and implications. First, the artefact developed provides a framework on which collaborative EM report writing tools can be developed, for example the prototype developed for evaluation. This framework is based on the needs of remote EM practitioners and assists with sharing timely and accurate information between EM responders. This framework could be utilised for further research in EM or other similar fields that require sharing of timely and accurate information. Finally, there were also several technical contributions to the diffsync technique including flexible locking and user attribution which provide a toolkit for emerging work paradigms such as multisynchronous editing and crowdsourcing...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{facility}} management (FM) software tools, lacking <b>automatic</b> <b>synchronisation</b> with the domain and rich semantic modelling, {{are limited to}} the simpler querying of manually maintained models. A software system that monitors and interprets temporally changing (internal) building environments and generates related knowledge can better assist in {{facility management}} decision making. This paper introduces a non-intrusive building monitoring framework that includes ZigBee sensor network and supporting software agents to provide better building space usage monitoring through software agents based on the belief-desire-intention (BDI) abstraction, exploiting ontology based reasoning to direct behaviour. The non-intrusive method is particularly useful and more amenable than the use of cameras for example when building monitoring involves human behaviours. The use of the multi agent paradigm renders a system that delivers demonstrable rationality and is robust within the dynamic environment that it operates. Agent behaviour directed at working towards goals is rendered intelligent with semantic web technologies. The capture of semantics through formal expression to model the environment adds a richness that the agents exploit to intelligently determine behaviours to satisfy goals that are flexible and adaptable. The agent goals are currently used to generate knowledge about building space usage as well as environmental conditions by elaborating and combining near real time sensor data and information from conventional building models. The deployed and tested sensor based monitoring framework exhibits intelligence that will find application in the better support of decision making by integration with existing FM tools...|$|E

This process is very manual, cumbersome and time-consuming which takes about 8 - 10 hours {{for an average}} lm duration of 2 and a half hours. AutoTC, a multi-threaded client-server application has been built for the automatic recognition of time-codes {{for the purpose of}} <b>automatic</b> <b>synchronisation</b> of subtitles in the broadcasting of Motion Pictures. It involves generating time-codes programmatically based on the input video's frame rate to be subtitled and using the audio to recognise in/out points automatically using the principles of Voice Activity Detection. Results show that the time taken to recognise time-codes automatically is approximately 1 / 6 th compared to the the time taken by a professional time-coder using `Poliscript'[18], a commercial tool used in the production of subtitles. `IN-SYNC', a new performance metric, has been proposed to evaluate the accuracy of the developed system which will foster further research and development in the eld of automatic subtitling in an attempt to make it the de-facto standard. The application has been tested on the NOIZEUS[30] corpus giving an IN-SYNC accuracy of 65 % on clean data with 6 mis-detections and an average of 51. 56 % on noisy data with 13 mis-detections which is very encouraging. The application can also send data to the MOSES[32] server developed for producing draft translations from Hindi to English which will make the subtitling process much faster, e cient and quality-centric...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{deals with}} indoor {{positioning}} {{based on a}} technique combining the characteristics of two systems: pseudolites and repeaters. This solution tries to combine the best of each method: for pseudolites, the {{ability to cope with}} carrier phase measurements to improve the accuracy and reduce the effect of multipath, and for repeater the simplicity of the infrastructure and the <b>automatic</b> <b>synchronisation</b> with the satellite constellation. A pseudolite is a long established and relatively well-known concept: it consists of ground based stations broadcasting GNSS-like signals. A receiver based on the ground can process this signal exactly {{as if it was a}} satellite signal and use it as satellite data in the computation of a navigation solution. Thus it is possible to deploy a ground based constellation of pseudo-satellites in order to compute a position inside buildings or any places where GNSS signals are too weak to be processed by classical or highly sensitive GNSS receivers. Since the signal has the same structure as the outdoor signal, precise measurements can be carried out like carrier phase measurements allowing the multipath error to be mitigated. However, there are limitations to this method. First is the synchronisation of the ground based constellation. As in any GNSS system, synchronisation is vital and it can be very expensive to have a stable clock on each pseudolite. Second is the potentiality of high interference between the pseudolites. As the distances of propagation are relatively small and the indoor environment has a propensity to raise obstacles in the signal trajectory, the difference of power between two signals can be high enough to lead to the disruption of the weakest by the strongest. (There is also potential interference with the GNSS signals but it does not concern the present discussion.) This phenomenon is called the Near-far problem. Thus, pseudolites are interesting but limited by the synchronisation and the Near-far problem. The repeater based technique has several declinations as shown in the section II. B of the paper, but the main principle remains. It consists of collecting GPS signals from an outdoor antenna and then forwarding them indoors in a sequential switching mode without any further treatment other than amplification. Each repeater, which consists of an antenna and a cable linked to the sequential switcher, transmits signals over a specific period while the others are switched off. Signal switching induces an offset of phase on the signal received by an indoor receiver. This offset corresponds to the difference of time of arrival between two successive repeaters. Four such Time of Difference Of Arrival measurements are then necessary to compute a position. With such a method, there is no interference between repeaters, thus no longer a Near-far problem. In addition, there is no need for expensive synchronisation of the constellation, but the switching induces signal discontinuities that limit the possibility of carrier phase measurements. Consequently, it increases the influence of multipaths on the computed solution. The proposed method, called the Repealite method, consists of transmitting a repeated signal as for the repeaters. But, instead of switching, the transmission on each antenna is delayed in such a way that the codes (Which are the same, though delayed, for all satellite signals received.) transmitted on each repealite do not interfere once they arrive at the receiver antenna. The principles of this method were presented in [1] and [2]. It is clear that the continuity of the signal allows carrier phase measurements and it is also clear that no synchronisation is required. However, the Near-far problem remains and can even be worse than in the case of pseudolites. The point we want to focus on this paper is the high level of interference than can occur because of simultaneous broadcasting of different satellite signals. This can induce severe interference that can disrupt the signal. This paper mainly focuses on methods developed in order to improve correlation mitigating the effect of the interference between repealites, interference that we call systemic interference. After the state of art of the GNSS based indoor positioning techniques in section II, the principles of the Repealite method are presented in section III which ends with a theoretical description of the received signal. Section IV provides simulations from a typical indoor positioning situation in standard conditions in order to illustrate the interference influences and to study solutions that could be carried out to mitigate them. Section V summarises the paper and describes future works...|$|E
