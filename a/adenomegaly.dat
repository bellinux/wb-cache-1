40|$|Bartonella quintana is a reemerging {{pathogen}} {{responsible for}} trench fever, endocarditis, bacteremia, and bacillary angiomatosis. We previously reported {{the first case}} of a patient with B. quintana-induced chronic <b>adenomegaly,</b> and here we present a report on a second patient. A hemodialyzed patient with Sjögren's syndrome presented with mediastinal adenomegalies and secondary pancytopenia. All diagnostic investigations remained negative, except that a Bartonella-like microorganism was isolated from a bone marrow biopsy. The isolate was identified as B. quintana by a specific mouse polyclonal antibody and by determination of a partial gltA (citrate synthase-encoding) gene and 16 S rRNA gene sequences. DNA of the pathogen was also detected in the <b>adenomegaly</b> and in the serum of the patient by PCR amplification of the gltA gene. Anti-B. quintana antibodies were never detected in the patient's serum throughout the 12 -month follow-up but were detected in the serum of the patient's cat.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Vascular {{transformation}} of lymph node sinuses (VTLS) {{is a rare}} disorder characterized by {{transformation of}} lymph node sinuses into endothelium-lined capillary-like channels. This phenomenon was originally discovered by accident whilst examining regional lymph nodes draining cancer. However, {{it has been found}} in association with other conditions associated with lympho venous congestion and distension, such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or even lymphoadenopathy alone. CASE REPORT: We describe the clinical case of a male dialysis patient with CHF (secondary to ischemic-hypertensive cardiac failure) who developed gross edema of the upper left limb on the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) side. Edema appeared within a month after carotid endoarteriectomy following approximately twenty years of chronic hemodialysis. Doppler ultrasound with other investigations showed that subclavian and upper cava veins were patent, but revealed many enlarged lymph nodes in the upper left thorax and in the left axilla. Suspicion of lymphoproliferative disease or metastatic involvement was raised and a lymph node biopsy was performed, revealing VTLS. Bone marrow biopsy and abdominal tomographies showed no mass or a proliferative disorder. Based on a hypothesis of an association between upper limb edema and ipsilateral AVF, the AVF was tied. The upper limb edema decreased dramatically within weeks, whilst RRT was continued by means of a central venous catheter. However, a few months later the patient's condition worsened; he developed relapsing pleural effusions and eventually died. Post-mortem examination revealed severe ischemic-calcific cardiopathy and showed that major thoracic and brachial vessels were patent whilst most thoracic and hilar lymph nodes showed VTLS and fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that in our patient CHF was the primary cause of thoracic <b>adenomegaly</b> and that CHF, together with venous hypertension at the left fistula's arm, caused ipsilateral limb edema. Thus, <b>adenomegaly</b> due to VTLS could represent an accompanying feature even in upper limb edema in chronic hemodialysis patients. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such an association. In our patient months were "lost" because we thought that limb edema was secondary to the <b>adenomegaly.</b> It is important that clinicians working in dialysis units are aware that when upper limb edema is present, <b>adenomegaly</b> might just be an accompanying symptom, especially in case of concomitant diagnosis of CHF...|$|E

We report {{the case of a}} healthy 40 -year-old male who complained of a right flank pain in 2010. Clinical examination revealed an enormous abdominal mass involving the adrenal gland as showed at abdominal CT scan. The patient underwent a surgical en-bloc excision of the right adrenal mass, after a laborious dissection of the tumor. Histological and immunohistochemical findings were suggestive of a neuroblastoma. Adjuvant treatment was not indicated since the complete gross excision of the tumor was performed, and subsequently the patient was considered stage 1 disease and because of the unavailability of MYCN status, necessary for achieving risk group stratification and a risk-adapted strategy. The patient remained in good local control, until January 2015 when he accused a locoregional and metastatic relapse consisting of two new para-renal masses and magma of celiac <b>adenomegalies</b> extending into the mediastinum. As the mass was considered unresectable, therapeutic decision of administrating neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by local treatment (surgery and / or radiotherapy) based on tumor response was taken. Given the bad tumor response to systemic treatment, a palliative radiotherapy was instaured. Currently the patient is two months after the end of radiation with mild clinical improvement. The purpose of presenting this case is not only to report an uncommon malignancy in adulthood, but also to raise awareness among clinicians adding this clinical entity as a differential diagnosis when a retroperitoneal mass is identified.

Discute-se a etiopatogenia, diagnóstico diferencial, terapêutica e prognóstico perante um doente com esta presentação. A Histiocitose de Células de Langerhans (HCL) ou a Síndrome Hemofagocítica/Linfohistiocitose Hemofagocítica (SH/LHH) são quadros clínicos semelhantes, com diagnósticos diferenciais variados,dificultando a terapêutica a instituir. Mais rara é a associação da HCLàSH/LHH, sendo que o diagnóstico definitivo destas duas entidades pode ser fornecido pela avaliação anatomopatológica, exame imunohistológico, citológico e o mielograma. Ambas são rapidamente progressivas e habitualmente fatais, caracterizando-se por pancitopénias graves, insuficiência hepática, alterações da ferritina, coagulopatia e diferentes sintomas neurológicos. A {{principal}} característica no primeiro caso consiste numa acumulação de células de Langerhans modificadas em vários órgão e tecidos, promovendo lesão e necrose exagerada, já no segundo estamos perantea acumulação de macrófagos em diferentes órgãos e tecidos. Levanta-se também a hipótese de a patogenia das células Natural Killer ser um impulsor da gravidade desta doença e um possível foco de futura investigação. A sua importância prende-se com o facto de muitas vezes estarem associados a reactividade a infecções e/ou à existência de processos neoplásicos, levando inevitavelmente à morte por falência multiorgânica. It {{is described}} {{a condition in}} children, characterized by fever, runny nose, productive cough and left <b>adenomegaly,</b> with progressive deterioration associated with pancytopenia, liver and ferritinchanges. It is discussed the etiology, differential diagnosis, therapy and prognosis standing before a patient with this presentation. The Langerhans CellsHistiocytosis (LCH) or Hemophagocytic Syndrome/Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HS/HLH) are similar clinical diseases, varying differential diagnoses, difficult the therapy to be imposed. More rare is the association of LCH to HS/HLH, but the definitive diagnosis of these two entities can be provided by pathologic evaluation, imunohistologic examination, cytology and myelogram. Both are rapidly progressive and usually fatal and is characterized by severe pancytopenia, liver failure, ferritin changes, coagulopathy and different neurological symptoms. The main characteristic {{in the first case}} is a Langerhans modifiedcell accumulation in various tissues and body, promoting necrosis injury and exaggerated, and the second is the accumulation of macrophages in different organs and tissues. It also raises the hypothesis of the pathogenesis of natural killer cells as an impeller of the worsening of this disease and a possible focus for future research. Its importance concerns the fact that they often are associated with reactivity to infection and/or to the existence of neoplasic processes, inevitably leading to death from multiorgan failure...|$|E
40|$|Background: In 2004, the {{deployment}} of Homeopathy in the pediatric ward at the University Hospital of GaffrÃƒÂ©e Guinle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ UNIRIO (HUGG at the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro) was initiated in conjunction with both the Pediatric and Homeopathy Service. A research project approved by the HUGG Ethics and Research Committee was prepared to survey the most prevalent diseases. A team composed of medical students and doctors participating in the homeopathy course was formed and underwent training, enabling them to use the established protocols of action. A partnership was established with the Fluminense Federal University(Universidade Federal Fluminense Ã¢â‚¬â€œ UFF), for the supply of drugs. In early 2009, the research project started, followed by homeopathic treatment in the pediatric ward. &# 13; &# 13; Aim: To demonstrate the diseases and treatment using homeopathic therapy on patients in the pediatric ward at the HUGG-UNIRIO-Brazil. &# 13; &# 13; Methodology: A sectional clinical study was carried out on patients participating in a research approved and registered by the Brazilian Research Ethics Committee, named,"The study {{of the effect of}} Homeopathic Treatment as an Adjunct Therapy on patients Hospitalized in the Pediatric Ward of HUGG". Criteria of Inclusion: Newborns up to the age of 16 of both sexes were admitted to the pediatric ward of HUGG, from May to October 2009. The diagnosis for admission being: respiratory, gastrointestinal and/or dermatologic diseases. A consent form had to be accepted and signed by the person responsible. Inclusion depended on the availability of having the appropriate homeopathic medicine in stock. Criteria of Exclusion: Cases of discontinuation of the homeopathic treatment or medical records not completed correctly. The medical records were analyzed individually. Microsoft Office Excel 2007 was used for data collection and analysis. &# 13; &# 13; Results: 32 patients admitted: 80 % treated with Homeopathy; Diagnosis for admission: 73 % respiratory, 11. 5 % dermatological, 4 % gastrointestinal and 11. 5 % other diseases (malnutrition, <b>adenomegaly,</b> eyelid edema); 37 % had secondary diseases. An average of 4. 7 medicaments (min 01 -max 09) was used per patient, 31 % repeated the medication in two different dinamizations. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Diagnosis for admission and medication usedÃ¢â‚¬Â: a) respiratory: 79 % Pulmao histaminum, 32 % Antimonium tartaricum, 21 % Natrum sulfuricum, 21 % Sambucus nigra, 16 % Ipecacuanha, 16 % Nux vomica, 16 % Medorrhinum; b) dermatological: 100 % Apis mellifica, 33 % Dulcamara, 33 % Mezereum, 33 % Psorinum, 33 % Rhus toxicodendron, 33 % Alumina; c) gastrointestinal: 100 % Ipecacuanha, 50 % Gambogia, 50 % Alumina. Dinamizations used: 5, 6, 12, 30 and 200 CH, and 200 FC. 55. 5 % of the medication used were only local effect medicines, 45. 5 % of the medication used were in association with the general effect medicines. &# 13; &# 13; Conclusion: The need to use several homeopathic medicines was obseved. The practice of inpatients was shown to be similar to the emergency outpatient when using medicine for local effect and medicine for general effect. Due to the positive results obtained with homeopathy, patients not initially foreseen in the research were included in this study on demand from parents or persons responsible for the children. This study demonstrates the need for a greater number of patients to allow the creation of prescription protocols and case-control studies to identify the most effective homeopathic prescription techniques...|$|E
