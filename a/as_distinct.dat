5|$|Hemorrhage from a Rathke's cleft cyst, {{a remnant}} of Rathke's pouch that {{normally}} regresses after embryological development, may cause symptoms that are indistinguishable from pituitary apoplexy. Pituitary apoplexy is regarded by some <b>as</b> <b>distinct</b> from Sheehan's syndrome, where the pituitary undergoes infarction {{as a result of}} prolonged very low blood pressure, particularly when caused by bleeding after childbirth. This condition usually occurs {{in the absence of a}} tumor. Others regard Sheehan's syndrome as a form of pituitary apoplexy.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of books, {{articles}} and websites now describe AS, and prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS {{recognized as an}} important subgroup. Whether it should be seen <b>as</b> <b>distinct</b> from high-functioning autism is a fundamental issue requiring further study, and {{there are questions about}} the empirical validation of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. In 2013, DSM-5 eliminated AS as a separate diagnosis, folding it into the autism spectrum on a severity scale.|$|E

5|$|A {{long-lived}} plant {{reaching an}} age of up to 60 years, I.anemonifolius resprouts from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, after bushfire. Seedlings appear in the year following a fire. Although I.anemonifolius was collected by Daniel Solander in 1770, it was not described until 1796 by Richard Salisbury. Several varieties have been named, though none are now recognised <b>as</b> <b>distinct.</b> It was first cultivated in the United Kingdom in 1791. I.anemonifolius grows readily in the garden if located in a sunny or part-shaded spot with sandy soil and good drainage.|$|E
5|$|C. b. graptogyne, (Endangered) {{known as}} the {{south-eastern}} red-tailed black cockatoo, is found in southwestern Victoria and southeastern South Australia in an area bordered by Mount Gambier to the west, Portland to the south, Horsham to the northeast and Bordertown to the north. The smallest of the five subspecies, it was only recognised <b>as</b> <b>distinct</b> in the 1980s. It is predominantly dependent on stands of Eucalyptus baxteri (brown stringybark), Eucalyptus camaldulensis (river redgum) and Allocasuarina luehmannii (buloke) for feeding and nesting. These tree species have been all threatened by land clearing and most remaining are on private land; possibly only 500–1000 individuals remain. The subspecies and its habitat {{are the subject of}} a national recovery plan. In 2007 local landowners are being reimbursed for assisting in regenerating suitable habitat.|$|E

5|$|Carrick {{is a small}} {{historic}} {{village that}} is primarily a residential settlement for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town. Development has been slow and has not changed the town's original 19th century character. The local council's development plan aims to restrict development along Meander Valley road and prevent the merging of Carrick and Hadspen, keeping them <b>as</b> <b>distinct</b> centres. Construction is only planned within the town's boundary, where up to sixty homes could potentially be built under the strategic plan that runs until 2016. The town's development boundary is dictated by the span of sewerage connection. There are few businesses in the town and little incentive for business growth due to the town's small population. The town is in the Meander Valley Council local government area, the Federal Division of Lyons, and the State Division of Lyons.|$|E
5|$|Cryptoprocta spelea, {{also known}} as the giant fossa, is an extinct species of {{carnivore}} from Madagascar in the family Eupleridae, which is most closely related to the mongooses and includes all Malagasy carnivorans. It was first described in 1902, and in 1935 was recognized as a separate species from its closest relative, the living fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox). C.spelea is larger than the fossa, but otherwise similar. The two have not always been accepted <b>as</b> <b>distinct</b> species. When and how the larger form became extinct is unknown; there is some anecdotal evidence, including reports of very large fossas, that {{there is more than one}} surviving species.|$|E

Additionally, nefazodone is documented to have caused clitoral engorgement, <b>as</b> <b>distinct</b> from clitoral priapism, in one case, and clitoral priapism can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
