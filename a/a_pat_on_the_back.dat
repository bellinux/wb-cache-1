500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{reported that}} [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter" [...] was a [...] "stellar episode that was hitting {{all the right}} beats", and commented that [...] "ven the tired, formulaic structure of Jack's two women scenario was given some great new lines" [...] from Fey and Cannon, who developed the script.

Clubs Nathan Rabin said that he enjoyed [...] "just about every minute" [...] of this episode, and praised Liz's speech citing it as the [...] "crowning moment" [...] from [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter". Rabin also liked the Toofer quitting storyline writing that it [...] "could easily have gone nowhere but the show made it both funny and surprisingly thoughtful by {{using it as a}} springboard to discuss Affirmative Action and our society's defiantly uneven playing field." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik noted that this episode was stronger than [...] "Khonani", which aired the same day of the week as this episode. Sean Gandert of Paste wrote that Toofer's plot was not [...] "given {{more than a few minutes}} of screen time [...] it also doesn't wear out its welcome... The show doesn't address race, gender, or affirmative action in a particularly enlightened manner, but who cares, it's funny." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that he found the most enjoyment in Liz's story, writing that he found it [...] "endearing". In regards to Jack's plot, Mersel said that Jack is able to play off Nancy and Avery so well that [...] "I am going back and forth on whether or not to scold the NBC boss or give him <b>a</b> <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> Avery and Nancy both have their shining moments, but I feel that he must choose quite soon, or he will be loosing [...] both." ...|$|E
