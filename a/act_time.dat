On the face of it, it seems that people who must attend countless {{meetings}} {{are the ones who}} need online diary planners the most. However, actual trends show that those who are in the habit of recording and chronicling their activities all the time are the real takers and users of online diary planners.

Through the medium of such online diaries, they have kept millions of others in the know of their personal plans, thoughts, their medical treatment procedures, etc. Since all sorts of people have been using online diary planners since their advent in the 1990s, the demand for perfect online organizers and personal information managers (PIMS) has been growing steadily with time. Initially, web-based Filofax came into being to satisfy the organizing need of users. But such applications had their disadvantages. This forced users to turn to solutions like <b>ACT!,</b> <b>Time</b> and Chaos.

5000|$|Mike Diver of BBC Music, {{said the}} album was [...] "A solid debut of country-tinged ballads and zesty pop spoiled by an ill-advised cover". iheartmusic.co.uk expressed: The group, formed and managed by Louis Walsh {{alongside}} Westlife's Kian Egan, have spent longer perfecting their sound and style than most acts have deals for these days, (poor Mini Viva, Girls Can't Catch, Joe McElderry…). So the expected standard of their debut {{was always going to}} be high, especially with Louis and Kian's track record in the business. With the influx of girl groups in 2011 it's easy to try and compare them to others, but Wonderland have their own sound, they've perfected the blend of pop and country, with an added splash of rock. And with their five different, but impressively strong voices combining as one, each bringing a different layer to the track, the result is an impressive debut album. Whilst it is noticeable that {{the first half of the}} album contains the tracks that were first being performed a year ago, it is refreshing to see a label give an <b>act</b> <b>time</b> to find their feet, and not rush into releasing an album, that then gets padded out with mediocre covers and fillers, and hoping for the best.I can safely say it's surpassed all expectations I had, as you all know I judge albums by how many tracks I can get in to an album before I have the urge to skip a track, and Wonderland passes that test with flying colours. To save me repeating myself for every track I talk about, the vocals on this album are phenomenal. The arrangements are spot on, the emotion comes across in the ballads perfectly, and you would never think that this was the first album released by the group. It is an amazing collection of songs, which has the perfect balance of light and shade between ballads and more upbeat tracks. IndieLondon interpreted the album: [...] "True, it's polished pop that sound-checks everything from Taylor Swift to The Corrs via a little Fleetwood Mac and even ABBA, but it's this mix of easy to identify styles, coupled with their telling ability to deliver a catchy melody, that makes the album better than most debuts from girl bands. Overall, then, we had more reason to be optimistic rather than glum about the emergence of yet another girl band." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a {{design of the}} x control chart used in supply chain management system to improve customer satisfaction of supplier. Recently, due to ever increasing competition in supplier markets, it is demanded to offer the low-cost and high quality product in short due time. Therefore, studying the balance of quality and the due time and cost has become a new problem to supplier. In short run process, the time of treating an assignable cause (<b>ACT</b> <b>time)</b> is an important effect to the total cost and due time. To resolve the above problem, in this research, first a design of the control chart is developed in which the <b>ACT</b> <b>time</b> was considered. Then, from an economic viewpoint, the mathematical formulations which correspond to the design are shown. Finally, by numerically consideration, the balance of quality (control limits width) and due time and the total expectation cost is discussed, and the important relations between the due time, <b>ACT</b> <b>time</b> and the total expectation cost are investigated...|$|E

40|$|Intervention {{strategies}} in adolescents at ultra high-risk (UHR) for psychosis are promising for reducing conversion to overt illness, but have only limited impact on functional outcome. Recent {{studies suggest that}} cognition does not further decline during the UHR stage. As social and cognitive impairments typically develop before the first psychotic episode and even years before the UHR stage, prevention should also start much earlier in the groups at risk for schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. Early intervention strategies could aim to improve stress resilience, optimize brain maturation, and prevent or alleviate adverse environmental circumstances. These strategies should urgently be tested for efficacy: the prevalence of ~ 1 % implies that yearly ~ 22 in every 100, 000 people develop overt symptoms of this illness, {{despite the fact that}} for many of them-e. g., children with an affected first-degree family member or carriers of specific genetic variants-increased risk was already identifiable early in life.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundMore {{aggressive}} {{management of}} cystic fibrosis (CF), {{along with the}} use of new therapies, has led to increasing survival. Thus, the recommended daily treatment regimens for most CF adults are complex and time consuming. MethodsIn the Project on Adult Care in CF (PAC-CF), an ongoing longitudinal study of CF adults, we assessed self-reported daily treatment activities and perceived treatment burden as measured by the CF Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R), a disease-specific quality of life measure. ResultsAmong the 204 respondents, the median number of daily therapies reported was 7 (IQR 5 – 9) and the mean reported time spent on treatment activities was 108  minutes per day (SD 58  min). Respondents reported a median of 3 inhaled and 3 oral therapies on the day prior to the survey. Only 49 % reported performing airway clearance (ACT) on that day. There were no differences in the number of medications or the time to complete therapies based on gender, age or FEV 1. The mean CFQ-R treatment burden domain score was 52. 3 (SD 22. 1), with no significant differences in the treatment burden based on age or FEV 1. In a multivariable model controlling for age, gender, and FEV 1, using 2 or more nebulized medications and performing ACT for ≥ 30  min were significantly associated with increased treatment burden. ConclusionThe level of daily treatment activity is high for CF adults regardless of age or disease severity. Increasing number of nebulized therapies and increased <b>ACT</b> <b>time,</b> but not gender, age, or pulmonary function, are associated with higher perceived treatment burden. Efforts to assess the effects of high treatment burden on outcomes such as quality of life are warranted...|$|E
40|$|Objective The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of 20 -day litter weight on behavior and heart rate variability (HRV) of piglets under stress. Methods Forty four original litters were categorized as high litter weight (HW) litters (n = 22) and low litter weight (LW) litters (n = 22) by 20 -day litter weight. From each original HW litter, three males and three females were randomly selected after weaning and the 12 piglets from two original litters with similar age of days were regrouped into one new high litter weight (NHW) litter (11 NHW litters in total). The original LW litters were treated with a same program, so that there were 11 new low litter weight (NLW) litters as well. The latencies to first fighting, fighting frequencies and duration within three hours were recorded after regrouping and the lesions on body surface within 48 hours were scored. Besides, HR (heart rate, bpm, beats per minute) and activity count (<b>ACT),</b> <b>time</b> domain indexes and frequency domain indexes of the piglets were measured in an isolation trial to analyze the discrepancy in coping with stress between the original HW and LW litters. Results The results exhibited that piglets from the HW litters launched fighting sooner and got statistically higher skin lesion score than those from the LW litters (p = 0. 03 and 0. 02, respectively). Regarding the HRV detection, compared with the HW litters, the LW litters exhibited a lower mean HR (p< 0. 05). In the isolation test, a highly significant higher ACT value was observed between the HW litters, compared to the LW litters (p< 0. 01). Significant differences were observed in standard deviation of R-R intervals, standard deviation of all normal to normal intervals, and most frequency-domain indicators: very low-frequency, low-frequency, and high frequency between the HW and LW litters as well. The difference in LF:HF was not significant (p = 0. 779). Conclusion This study suggests that compared with litters of low 20 -day litter weights, litters with higher 20 -day litter weight take more positive strategies to cope with stress and have stronger HRV regulation capacity; HW litters demonstrate better anti-stress and adaptation capacity in the case of regrouping and isolation...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{new perspectives}} on the epistemic conditions of pre- and post-revolutionary Soviet thought (1910 s–early 1930 s) and constructs a transdisciplinary entry point into a materialist ontology of ‘poor life’. The concept of poor life engages contemporary debates on class composition and individuation from the materialist viewpoint of self-organising labour causality and social mediation. The thesis opens with a critical examination of the ‘Western’ and ‘Eastern’ divide in Marxist philosophy and shifts discussion from the official doctrine of Bolshevism to the under-represented epistemologies of Empirio-Marxism and Spinozist- Hegelianism in the philosophy and political theory of Alexander Bogdanov, the writings and art criticism of Andrei Platonov and the experimental philosophy and psychology of Lev Vygotsky. A transdisciplinary, post-revolutionary logic assumes that theory should start where Marx ended and that it should act in a Marxist fashion across all conceptual and practical realms. The reconstruction of these epistemological conditions leads to an alternative philosophical genealogy of Soviet avant-garde art and the writings of Andrei Platonov. The thesis explores the connections between the Empirio-Marxism of Bogdanov and the problematic of construction, ‘life-building’ and production in the theories of the Soviet avant-garde. Bogdanov proposes an organisational ontology of the active and productive capacity of labour to compose and construct historically determined ‘life-complexes’ and orders of material relations. In turn, the organisation of sensibility, things and relations, or communist ‘life-building’, becomes the primary theoretical and practical agenda of Proletkult, Constructivism, Productivism and the Literature of Fact. The thesis demonstrates the unique place of Andrei Platonov within these conceptual settings. The core of the thesis is a reconstruction of Platonov’s method and form of writing, the aim {{of which is to}} demonstrate the conceptual reciprocity of the problems of ‘lifebuilding’ and ‘poor life’. Platonov stresses the negativity of partition and compartmentalisation within the compositional logic of ‘life-building’. In the experience of social poverty, the selforganising force of labour produces a disjunctive unity of thinking and speech, reaction and <b>act,</b> <b>time</b> and space. Vygotsky’s Spinozist-Hegelianism exposes the structural logic of this negativity. The reconstruction of his system shows how mediation produces a dialectical dramaturgy of individuation out of the compositional materiality of poverty and the given ensemble of social relations. The thesis concludes by outlining a differential unity between the three authors. The Soviet problematisation of poor life links social and ontological degrees of organisation, offering epistemological models of compositional productivity and of the individuating negativity of ‘life-building’. The epistemic conditions that we reconstruct in the thesis may have vanished along with their revolutionary context, but they are likely to resurface in the course of any new experiment in radical social transformation...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} the PDCA cycle was {{originally}} developed by Walter A. Shewhart during the 1930 s and promoted very effectively from the 1950 s by W. Edwards Deming. Consequently, it has become to {{play a key role}} in the quality control field. Recently, the business environment has become competitive, and due time of the products has shortened. To raise efficiency in industries, the necessity for distinguishing the PDCA model which starts with PLAN and the CAPD model which starts with CHECK becomes clear (Ikezawa, 1985; Shiba and Walden, 2001;Matsui, 2005). In today’s global manufacture networks, for the improvement of produces quality, there has been an increased interest in information technology (IT) control charts which are used to monitor online the process. When the control charts is used in production process, in order to raise the efficiency of management, two cases often take place. One case starts from deciding control lines; the other case starts from searching an assignable cause in the out-of-control state. To clarify the management principles of the control chart’s PDCA and CAPD procedures, in this thesis, we propose and investigate the PDCA and CAPD designs of control charts based on the above cases. Since Duncan’s pioneering work (1956), many studies have been developed to serve different purposes for the economic model of control charts. From the viewpoint of the production run, Gibra (1971), Ladany and Bedi (1976), Saniga (1989), Jones and Case (1981) have considered the economic statistical model of the x control chart for the infinite-length horizon; Crowder (1992), Del Castillo and Montgomery (1996) have considered models of the control chart for short run cases. However, the PDCA and CAPD designs were not considered. On the other hand, the general definitions of the control chart’s PDCA procedures can be found in Takahashi (1999) and Amasaka et al. (2003). However, the systematic investigations of the control chart’s PDCA and CAPD design (formulating and numerically analyzing) were not done. In chapter 1, first the background of this thesis are introduced, and the basic concepts of the control chart related to this research are provided. Then, the PDCA and CAPD designs of the control chart are explained. Finally, the structure of this thesis is described. In chapter 2, based on the x control chart, the PDCA and CAPD design are proposed and the mathematical formulations of the designs are shown. Then, the optimal values (ni, ki, vi) of the two designs are studied. Finally, by numerically analyzing the relations between the key parameters and the total expected cost per unit time, it can be understood that the CAPD design is cheaper for the process in which the assignable cause occurs frequently, and the PDCA design is cheaper for the processes in which the risk of the nonconformities is large or the cost of ACT is expensive. In chapter 3, to management nonconforming fraction of production process, based on the two features of P control chart (one is the countermeasures for points falling beyond upper control limit and lower control limit are different. The other is the time of ACT of P control chart is longer), the PDCA and CAPD model of P control chart are proposed. Then, their mathematical formulations are shown. Finally, by numerically analyzing, it can be understood that the total expected cost of both models can be decreased by improving the power or reducing the <b>ACT</b> <b>time.</b> Due to today’s increasing competition, the due time delay prevention is paid to attention to improve customer. However, the penalties for delay of the due time were not considered in chapter 2 and chapter 3. Therefore, in chapter 4, the PDCA and CAPD models of x chart with tardiness penalty are proposed and their mathematical formulations are explained in detail. Then, the mathematical principles of two rules (3 σ and Average Run Length) of an assignable cause judgment are considered, and the both models based on the 3 σ rule and ARL (Average Run Length) rule are studied. Finally, by investigating the relation between key time parameters and the total expected cost (Ct), it can be understood that in finite due time production process, Ct of the PDCA model with tardiness penalty increases with the increase of due time, and the minimum value of Ct of CAPD model with tardiness penalty almost exists by the change of due time. In chapter 5, based on the features of P control chart, the models of P control chart in which the penalties for delaying the due time are developed. Then, from an economic viewpoint, the mathematical formulations which correspond to the two models are explained in detail. Finally, by numerically analyzing the two models, it can be understood that in finite due time production process, the PDCA design should be used in the process in which a false alarm cost or the ACT penalty cost are less expensive, and the CAPD design should be used in the process in which the ACT cost per unit time or the penalty cost of CHECK per unit time are less expensive. In chapter 6, this thesis is summarized and the future studies are discussed. 電気通信大学 200...|$|E
