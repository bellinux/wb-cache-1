25|$|The team played another {{match with}} Sussex in the Championship, {{this time at}} Cheltenham College, and were duly beaten by 226 runs, and relegation from Division One was now almost a certainty. However, the Sunday brought <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> <b>surprise,</b> as they thumped Essex by 60 runs {{to move out of}} the relegation zone. A Championship draw with Surrey came in the third week of August, before a win over Lancashire sent them out of the relegation zone in the National League, but a loss to Glamorgan the {{following}} day immediately set them back. The month ended with Gloucestershire becoming the first team to lose to Glamorgan in 2005.|$|E

Talley had only 123 yards {{in the first four}} games of the year. Fullback Mark Pierce also had a 44-yard run on a fourth-and-one, with Matt Jones adding a 70-yard touchdown scamper in the fourth quarter.|$|E

The majority of his men passed through Hanover {{early in the morning}} of June 30, pausing briefly for refreshments and to receive the greetings of the jubilant townspeople. Their town had been raided three days before by Confederate Lt. Col. Elijah V. White's cavalry, attached to Maj. Gen. Jubal Early's division that had occupied York County. White's Virginians and Marylanders had followed the railroad to Hanover from nearby Gettysburg, and taken horses, food, supplies, clothing, shoes, and other desired items from the townspeople, often paying with valueless Confederate money or drafts on the Confederate government. White's raiders had destroyed the area's telegraph wires, cutting off communications with the outside world, before sacking the nearby Hanover Junction train station. The unexpected arrival of Kilpatrick's column was <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> <b>surprise</b> to the residents of Hanover, who warmly greeted the Union troopers with food and drink.|$|E

500|$|According to Bollywood Hungama, after {{establishing}} {{a reputation for}} portraying neurotic characters, Ranaut was seeking projects that would be [...] "less emotionally exhausting" [...] for her. Her first release of 2011 was Anand L. Rai's Tanu Weds Manu, a romantic comedy opposite R. Madhavan, which Ranaut considers a [...] "game changer" [...] for her. Rai stated that he cast her for the role to illustrate that the actress was capable of playing other roles and that her character in the film was unlike any of those that she had played previously. Critical reaction to the film was mixed, though Ranaut's performance was praised. Rajeev Masand wrote, [...] "Kangana Ranaut is <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> <b>surprise</b> in a cheery, upbeat part that we haven't seen her take on before. She rises to the challenge, only hampered occasionally by her mangled dialogue delivery." [...] Ranaut received Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies, including Screen and Zee Cine.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} acclaim from critics. [...] James Montgomery of MTV News {{said of the}} song, [...] "there {{are moments}} on Stairs that stop you dead in your tracks, send shivers up your spine and make you go 'Whoa'... like the first four-and-a-half minutes of 'I Will Possess Your Heart,' a propulsive whirl of stalking bass line, spindly guitars and stabbing piano." [...] Will Hermes noted in Rolling Stone that the sense of menace in the song was [...] "playing against type for a guy with one of rock's purest voices—a vibrato-less, bell-clear high tenor whose choirboy quality only throws the darkness here into relief." [...] Blender Jonah Weiner concurred, stating [...] "it's <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> <b>surprise</b> to hear Gibbard inhabit such a self-consciously creepy role, rather than play the occasionally errant, essentially good-hearted boyfriend who soft-shoes through {{so many of his}} tales." [...] In 2011, Tyler Kane of Paste included the song in a list of [...] "the 25 creepiest songs about love".|$|E
5000|$|Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly graded {{the film}} a B, as it [...] "delivers <b>a</b> few <b>pleasant</b> <b>surprises,</b> {{including}} <b>a</b> smart story".

Fort Worth Star-Telegram contributor Robert Philpot, {{who gave}} the episode a B+ rating, thought it was <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> <b>surprise</b> and an indication that there [...] "might be some life" [...] left in the show. He added that the episode feels fresher because of the [...] "rapid-fire dialogue, farcical situations and ubiquitous double-entendres. And although this live edition was inarguably a stunt, it did prove that real people — and not mere machines — laugh at the characters and the jokes." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine {{also noted that the}} episode showed that Will & Grace still had a bit of life left. He added that McCormack seemed to flourish under the pressure, and that Hayes and Mullally [...] "were given free rein to flex their Jack and Karen [...] ". Dana Stevens of Slate magazine reported that [...] "Alive and Schticking" [...] offered a chance to punch up the show with some [...] "unusually broad sight gags." [...] She wrote that the real reason to watch the episode were the mistakes made by the actors.|$|E

2500|$|Before I Self Destruct has {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 62, based on 15 reviews. Allmusic called it [...] "a fantastic juggernaut of a 50 album if you exit early, {{and a very}} good one even if you don't". Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Growling violent threats over hard beats, 50 sounds the hungriest he has in years. Of course, there’s nothing remotely original about the formula he’s returning to, but at least he’s going through the motions with gusto". The A.V. Club said that, [...] "If Destruct qualifies as <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> <b>surprise,</b> it’s only because 50 Cent’s last few releases set the bar so low. Still, {{for the first time since}} The Massacre, it’s once again intermittently fun to root for the bad guy" [...] Pitchfork Media wrote that, [...] "After initially promising a return to form, 50 doesn't have the ability or initiative to hold the listener's interest over the long run." [...] PopMatters said that, [...] "With surprisingly little filler, renewed energy, and the unique glimpse Before I Self Destruct offers into the psyche of a public figure as intriguing as Curtis Jackson, 50 Cent has crafted easily his best album since [...] "Get Rich or Die Trying." ...|$|E

[...] Ashish Magotra of Rediff gave negative reviews on Rampal, writing: [...] "Among the actors, Arjun Rampal as the hero does pretty much what he has been known to do. He models. His acting capabilities leave a lot to be desired." [...] His last release of the year was Ashok Mehta's Moksha. It was actually his first film, but was released after Pyaar Ishq Aur Mohabbat. Rampal was paired with famous actress Manisha Koirala in a lead role in Moksha. This film marked Rampal's third consecutive flop at the box office, but Rampal earned critical acclaim. Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM wrote: [...] "Arjun Rampal excels in a role that was difficult to portray. He takes giant strides as a performer and proves that he's an actor with an amazing range."

[...] Adam Markovitz of the same publication described the documentary as a [...] "delicate mix of the calculated and confessional, designed to let us just far enough into Knowles' world to keep us interested in her next tour, album, soda allegiance, etc." [...] Carrie Battan from Pitchfork wrote that [...] "there's no unturned insight, no secret to be discovered in this documentary besides the fact that she's simply everything we want her to be."

There he advanced through the first round beating E. Chelli. In the second round he was drawn to face young French prodigy and reigning Olympic champion André Gobert. It was a quick defeat as Sumarokov couldn't adapt to the fast paced net-volley game of Gobert. He was also eliminated from the doubles contest in the very first round mostly due to his partner Paul Aymé's leg injury, which he suffered the previous night and kept them handicapped the whole match. [...] Oddly it is thanks to these early exits that he was eligible for the consolation tournament, which was organized for the losers of the first two rounds. There he played his first match against one-half of his recent doubles opponents William le Maire de Warzée d'Hermalle (who had a 6-1 head-to-head record against fellow Belgian Champion Paul de Borman at the time). [...] This proved to be a tough warm-up for the later matches and it went two sets six-all before Elston broke through. [...] His former doubles partner Paul Aymé resigned from the quarterfinal for unknown reasons and gave him a walkover. [...] In the semifinal came <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> <b>surprise</b> as the defending consolation title-holder Felix Pipes lost to him in two fast sets.

After a four set deuce the two finalists agreed to leave the decision to the drawing of lots and finish the match. The luck favored Salm and therefore he was announced the winner.
