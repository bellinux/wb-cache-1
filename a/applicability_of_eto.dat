40|$|Based on the {{meteorological}} data from 46 {{stations in the}} Hai River Basin (HRB) from 1961 - 2010, the annual and seasonal variation of reference evapotranspiration was analyzed. The sensitivity coefficients combined with the detrend method were used to discuss the dominant factor affecting the reference evapotranspiration (ETo). The obtained {{results indicate that the}} annual reference evapotranspiration is dominated by the decreasing trends at the confidence level of 95 % in the southern and eastern parts of the HRB. The sensitivity order of climatic variables to ETo from strong to weak is: relativity humidity, temperature, shortwave radiation and wind speed, respectively. However, comprehensively considering the sensitivity and its variation strength, the detrend analysis indicates that the decreasing trends <b>of</b> <b>ETo</b> in eastern and southern HRB may be caused mainly by the decreasing wind speed and shortwave radiation. As for the relationship between human activity and the trend <b>of</b> <b>ETo,</b> we found that ETo decreased more significantly on the plains than in the mountains. By contrast, the population density increased more considerably from 2000 to 2010 on the plains than in the mountains. Therefore, in this paper, the correlation of the spatial variation pattern between ETo and population was further analyzed. The spatial correlation coefficient between population and the trend <b>of</b> <b>ETo</b> is - 0. 132, while the spatial correlation coefficient between the trend <b>of</b> <b>ETo</b> and elevation, temperature, shortwave radiation and wind speed is 0. 667, 0. 668, 0. 749 and 0. 416, respectively. This suggests that human activity has a certain influence on the spatial variation <b>of</b> <b>ETo,</b> while natural factors play a decisive role in the spatial variation of reference evapotranspiration in this area. 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland...|$|R

This phenotype is conferred by a loss-of-function allele of ethylene overproducer 1 (ETO 1; mutant alleles of which cause increased production of ethylene). We show that lack <b>of</b> <b>ETO</b> 1 function confers soil-salinity tolerance through improved shoot Na/K homeostasis, effected via the ethylene resistant 1 -constitutive triple response 1 ethylene signaling pathway.

The objective {{is to determine the}} characteristics <b>of</b> climatological <b>ETo</b> and to identify factors controlling its variability (including associated atmospheric circulations). Daily ETo anomalies are strongly correlated with net radiation (Rn) anomalies, relative humidity (RH), and cloud cover, and less with average daily temperature (Tavg). The highest intraseasonal variability <b>of</b> <b>ETo</b> daily anomalies occurs during the spring, mainly caused by anomalies below the high ETo seasonal values during cloudy days. A characteristic circulation pattern is associated with anomalies <b>of</b> <b>ETo</b> and its driving meteorological inputs, Rn, RH, and Tavg, at daily to seasonal time scales. This circulation pattern is dominated by 700 -hPa geopotential height (Z 700) anomalies over a region off the west coast of North America, approximately between 32 ° and 44 ° latitude, referred to as the California Pressure Anomaly (CPA). High cloudiness and lower than normal ETo are associated with the low-height (pressure) phase of the CPA pattern. Higher than normal ETo anomalies are associated with clear skies maintained through anomalously high Z 700 anomalies offshore of the North American coast.

The positive contribution of temperature rising to ET(o) is offset by the effect of wind speed and sunshine duration. In addition, primary causes to ET(o) changes are varied for differing climate regions.

The use of a reference crop ET (ETo) permits the standardization of ET estimates across varying conditions. So, ETo was estimated with the FAO- 56 Penman–Monteith equation using data from eight Iranian sites over a 41 -year period (1965 – 2005).

By chromosomal translocations ETO and MTG 16 become parts of fusion proteins characteristic of morphological variants of acute myeloid leukemia. Normal functions <b>of</b> <b>ETO</b> homologues have as yet not been examined. The goal of this work was to identify structural and functional promoter elements upstream of the coding sequence <b>of</b> the <b>ETO</b> gene in order to explore lineage-specific hematopoietic expression and get hints to function. RESULTS: A putative proximal ETO promoter was identified within 411 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Strong ETO promoter activity was specifically observed upon transfection of a promoter reporter construct into erythroid/megakaryocytic cells, which have endogeneous ETO gene activity. An evolutionary conserved region of 228 bp revealed potential cis-elements involved in transcription <b>of</b> <b>ETO.</b> Disruption <b>of</b> the evolutionary conserved GATA - 636 consensus binding site repressed transactivation and disruption of the ETS 1 - 705 consensus binding site enhanced activity <b>of</b> the <b>ETO</b> promoter. The promoter was stimulated by overexpression of GATA- 1 into erythroid/megakaryocytic cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay with erythroid/megakaryocytic cells showed specific binding of GATA- 1 to the GATA - 636 site. Furthermore, results from chromatin immunoprecipitation showed GATA- 1 binding in vivo to the conserved region <b>of</b> the <b>ETO</b> promoter containing the - 636 site.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of frequencies {{of the potential}} evapotranspiration (ETo) estimated with Priestley-Taylor method was analyzed for the region of Nova Odessa, state of São Paulo, Brazil. The annual maximum values <b>of</b> accumulated <b>ETo</b> were adjusted for periods from 2 to 30 days to the normal, lognormal, gama, beta and gumbel frequency distribution models. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, it was verified that the distributions normal, lognormal, beta and gumbel presented good adjustment. The gama model did not present adjustment to the data of this study. The medium values of potential evapotranspiração were {{very close to the}} obtained at the level of 50 % of probability (two years of return period) and lightly inferior to the values <b>of</b> <b>ETo</b> at the level of 75 % of probability (four years of return period).

40|$|The ETO protein was {{originally}} identified by its fusion to the AML- 1 transcription factor in translocation (8; 21) {{associated with the}} M 2 form of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The resulting AML- 1 –ETO fusion is an aberrant transcriptional regulator due to the ability <b>of</b> <b>ETO,</b> which does not bind DNA itself, to recruit the transcriptional corepressors N-CoR, SMRT, and Sin 3 A and histone deacetylases. The promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein is a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcriptional factor fused to retinoic acid receptor α in acute promyelocytic leukemia associated with the (11; 17) (q 23;q 21) translocation. PLZF also mediates transcriptional repression through the actions of corepressors and histone deacetylases. We found that <b>ETO</b> is one <b>of</b> the corepressors recruited by PLZF. The PLZF and ETO proteins associate in vivo and in vitro, and ETO can potentiate transcriptional repression by PLZF. The N-terminal portion <b>of</b> <b>ETO</b> forms complexes with PLZF, while the C-terminal region, which was shown to bind to N-CoR and SMRT, {{is required for the}} ability <b>of</b> <b>ETO</b> to augment transcriptional repression by PLZF. The second repression domain (RD 2) of PLZF, not the POZ/BTB domain, is necessary to bind to ETO. Corepression by ETO was completely abrogated by histone deacetylase inhibitors. This identifies ETO as a cofactor for a sequence-specific transcription factor and indicates that, like other corepressors, it functions through the action of histone deactylase...|$|R
