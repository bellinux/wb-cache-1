5|$|Its {{status in}} the history of Danish {{photography}} is rivalled by a portrait of Bertel Thorvaldsen sitting at an easel outside his studio in the garden of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts at Charlottenborg Palace in Copenhagen. This daguerrotype was taken by the French photographer Aymard Charles Théodore Neubourg, who visited Copenhagen in the summer of 1840. An examination of the circumstances under which it was taken reveals that the date was Sunday, 26 July 1840. It has also been noticed that Thorvaldsen is making the horn sign with what <b>apparently</b> <b>is</b> his left hand although, {{as a result of the}} daguerrotype mirror effect, it is actually his right hand. This has been ascribed to the anxiety he must have experienced while facing the new mechanical device which could reveal even the slightest detail.|$|E
5|$|The {{distribution}} of Transandinomys extends from eastern Honduras through Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia {{south and east}} to southwestern Ecuador and northern Venezuela, generally west and north of the Andes. The ranges of the two species overlap, but are distinct. T.bolivaris occurs from Honduras mainly on the Caribbean side of Central America south to western Colombia and northwestern Ecuador, up to 1800m (5900ft) above sea level. T.talamancae, which is found up to 1525m (5000ft) above sea level, is less widely distributed in Central America, as {{it is not known}} further north than northwestern Costa Rica, but is more widely distributed in South America, occurring into far southwestern Ecuador and northern Venezuela. It has also been recorded south of the Venezuelan Andes, in the narrow strip of forest between the Llanos and the mountains. Both species are forest rats, but whereas T.bolivaris is restricted to humid forest formations, T.talamancae <b>apparently</b> <b>is</b> more tolerant of drier forest, which explains its wider South American distribution.|$|E

25|$|The Boulder County clerk {{had been}} issuing {{licenses}} {{based on her}} own interpretation of the Tenth Circuit ruling in Kitchen soon after that ruling was handed down. The state attorney general filed a motion in the Colorado District Courts {{in an attempt to}} stay the clerk's actions. However, on July 10, 2014, a day after the Brinkman ruling, District Court Judge Andrew Hartman found that while the Boulder clerk violated the law—"There is little argument that Clerk Hall is engaging in a form of civil disobedience. She <b>apparently</b> <b>is</b> taking the position posited by St. Augustine and followed notably by Martin Luther King, Jr. that, 'an unjust law is no law at all.'"—but he refused to impose a restraining order or injunction upon her, as the state did not meet its high burden for a stay.|$|E

Bi-Ryu and Ah-Rin show up {{just in time to}} save her, though she shows no fear towards the man. He believes her to be a mute, as she has not spoken since he abducted her. Later, after meeting Bi Ryu's Party she speaks slowly with future predictions, accurately predicting Yhun Ah-Rin kicking Bi Ryu. It is also known that she <b>apparently</b> <b>is</b> wanted, as a group of assassins intrude upon Bi-Ryu's party and attempt to kill them to take Nirvana. She seems to like Cho Ryung, as she hugs her like a stuffed animal a lot (She's also {{the only one who can}} understand what Cho Ryung says). She carries the memory of the former heads of Myung Wong Shin Gyo, Parvati.|$|E
25|$|In the 2016 {{video game}} , the {{character}} Sorin Sprocket is eventually revealed to have anterograde amnesia, which he developed after unintentionally causing {{a car accident}} which killed his sister. This causes his memories to completely reset every time he wakes up from sleeping, {{to the day after}} this accident. This depiction is notable for demonstrating the relationship issues that arise between Sorin and his fiancee, Ellen Wyatt, {{as a result of this}} disorder, most noticeably with how Sorin's feelings towards her to coming across as distant and cold. As the storyline continues, however, the player comes to uncover that Sorin in fact deeply loves his fiancee, and is able to maintain this love despite his disorder, but in fact feels a sense of guilt over the fact that he has to constantly remind himself of the fact that this love exists inside of him every day, due to his disorder. It is also noticeable in that it depicts how Sorin deals with his disorder, by keeping a journal where he writes down every minuet detail of every day after his sister's death. He carries this journal around everywhere he goes as a substitution to his memories, and uses what is written in the notebook to become aware each time he wakes up of the fact that he he his condition, what the current date <b>apparently</b> <b>is,</b> and everything important that have apparently occurred on every day since he first developed the condition. The episode also deals with legal issues concerning the disorder, when it is debated during Ellen Wyatt's trial as to whether Sorin's journal can be considered a proper substitution to his memories for the sake of viable witness testimony. Danger's imposed by this also come into play when it is revealed that a page in Sorin's journal had been altered by someone, which causes him to go into mental collapse that any of his other memories and thoughts could also have arisen from someone else's manipulation.|$|E
500|$|Brownlee's {{relations}} with the federal parties were somewhat more harmonious. [...] While he personally preferred the Liberals, his history with Bennett led to a cordial working relationship. [...] Both parties made overtures towards Brownlee: King had invited him to join his cabinet {{while he was still}} attorney-general, and in 1932 sent an emissary to encourage union of all political parties opposed to the Conservatives. [...] Brownlee reiterated his policy to deal [...] "equally with Liberals and Conservatives in Ottawa", and declined King's overtures. [...] So too did Alberta Liberals, led by Howson and Charles Stewart, who sought to replace Brownlee rather than join with him. [...] In 1934, the Conservatives sent H. R. Milner to raise the possibility of the UFA and the Conservatives joining together against the Liberals and Co-operative Commonwealth Federation; Brownlee expressed interest, but made no move to enact such a coalition. [...] A frustrated Bennett dismissed him as [...] "a time server whose one object, <b>apparently,</b> <b>is</b> to retain office." ...|$|E

500|$|P. ibericus, the Iberian {{chiffchaff}} is brighter, greener on the rump, and yellower below than P. collybita, {{and has a}} tit-tit-tit-tswee-tswee song. It {{was initially}} named P. brehmii, but the type specimen of that taxon is not an Iberian chiffchaff. This species is found in Portugal and Spain, west of a line stretching roughly from the western Pyrenees via the mountains of central Spain to the Mediterranean; the Iberian and common chiffchaffs co-occur in a narrow band along this line. Apart from the northernmost section, the precise course of the contact zone is not well documented. A long-distance migrant, this species winters in western Africa. It differs from P. c. collybita in vocalisations, external morphology, and mtDNA sequences. There is [...] hybridization in the contact zone, almost always between male P. ibericus and female P. c. collybita, [...] and hybrids apparently show much decreased fitness; [...] hybrid females appear to be sterile according to Haldane's Rule. Regarding the latter aspect, {{it is interesting to}} note that the Iberian chiffchaff <b>apparently</b> <b>is</b> the oldest lineage of chiffchaffs and quite distinct from the common chiffchaff.|$|E
500|$|When Howard J. Savage of the Carnegie Foundation issued [...] "Bulletin 33" [...] in January 1930 criticizing {{recruitment}} and subsidization of athletes, Aigler challenged {{the fairness of}} the report. Aigler charged that Savage had [...] "no intention of being fair and accurate" [...] and accused Savage of questionable tactics in sending Michigan's president a report of conditions different from the report in the bulletin. Aigler also accused Savage of removing letters from the files of the athletic department to which he was allowed full access. He also argued that the report reflected eastern bias: [...] "In a number of places in the Bulletin the so-called Western Conference (now the Big Nine) is referred to and, curiously, almost always with a sort of half veiled sneer. The truth <b>apparently</b> <b>is</b> that the Bulletin was written {{from the point of view}} of the Eastern athletic man who has it pretty firmly fixed in mind that, athletically, things are pretty raw in the territory generally West of the Alleghenies." [...] Aigler later issued a 31-page report on athletic conditions at Michigan, charging the Carnegie Foundation with [...] "muck-raking." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{antiquarian}} John Bale in the 1550s listed six {{works of}} Foliot known to him, five {{of which were}} letters. The sixth work known to Bale was the commentary on the Song of Songs, which survived in a single manuscript, now in the Bodleian Library. Young also recorded a Lundinensis Ecclesiae as being by Foliot. The scholar John Pits gave much the same list in 1619, adding one work, a Vitas aliquot sanctorum Angliae, Librum unun, but this work never appears in a medieval book catalogue and has not survived under this name so it is unclear if Foliot wrote such a work. The antiquary Thomas Tanner, writing in the early 18th century, listed Foliot {{as the author of}} the seven works given by Bale and Pits, adding an eighth, the Tractatus Gilberti, episcopi London: Super Istud [...] "Sunt diuae olivae", citing John Leland, the 16th-century antiquary, as his source. This <b>apparently</b> <b>is</b> the collection of nine sermons on Saints Peter and Paul {{that has yet to be}} published and is still in manuscript at the Bodleian Library. Leland also listed another work by Foliot, the Omeliae Gileberti, episcopi Herefordensis, which he stated was held at Forde Abbey. This work, since lost, might have been the sermons mentioned above, or could have been a known collection of homilies, also lost. It is also possible that another Gilbert was the author. Lastly, Walter Map recorded that Foliot had begun work on a [...] "the Old and the New Law" [...] shortly before his death.|$|E
