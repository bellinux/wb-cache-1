50|$|Ophthalmologists {{sometimes}} measure patients’ dark adaptation {{using an}} instrument {{known as a}} dark <b>adaptometer.</b> Currently, there is one commercially available dark <b>adaptometer,</b> called the AdaptDx. It works by measuring a patient’s Rod Intercept (RI) time. RI {{is the number of}} minutes it takes for the eye to adapt from bright light to darkness. This RI number provides a clear and objective measurement of retinal function with 90% sensitivity and specificity. Basically, an RI of less than 6.5 minutes indicates a healthy dark adaptation function. However, an RI higher than 6.5 indicates impaired dark adaptation.|$|E

To prevent this from occurring and to initiate preventative strategies earlier in the disease process, dark adaptation testing may be performed.

40|$|To {{assess the}} inter-session {{repeatability}} of the Goldmann-Weekers <b>adaptometer</b> for {{the measurement of}} cone dark adaptation in a population of healthy subjects. Data were obtained from 31 healthy adults (mean age 21. 5 ± 2. 5) on 2 days. At each visit, pupils were dilated and a 96 % bleach of cone photopigment was administered to the test eye before threshold was monitored continuously for 5 min in the dark using the Goldmann-Weekers <b>adaptometer.</b> A single exponential function was fitted to the threshold recovery data on a least squares basis. The coefficient of repeatability (CoR) was calculated to assess the repeatability of the time constant of recovery (τ), initial threshold and final threshold. Cone dark adaptation functions were successfully recorded from all subjects on both visits. The CoR was 79. 48 s for τ, 0. 71 log cdm− 2 for the initial threshold, and 0. 58 log cdm− 2 for the final threshold. Paired samples t-tests showed {{that there were no}} significant differences between visits for any of the parameters assesed. Although the Goldmann-Weekers <b>adaptometer</b> was capable of monitoring the rapid changes in threshold that occur during cone dark adaptation, the CoR for τ was relatively large compared to the mean recovery time constants (126. 48 ± 40. 33 and 119. 94 ± 33. 25 s at the first and second visits, respectively). This indicates that the Goldmann-Weekers <b>adaptometer</b> is unlikely to be a useful instrument to chart changes in an individual’s vision over time...|$|E
40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{examination}} time for dark adaptometry, which including preadaptometry normally takes 30 minutes for an eye, a computerized <b>adaptometer</b> was constructed allowing monocular examination of both eyes simultaneously. The total examination time was thereby reduced from 60 to 30 minutes. This improvement {{was achieved by}} the use of electronically monitored transparent shutters that were alternately opened for the right eye, the left eye, or both eyes. Eighteen healthy subjects were examined 3 times each, and the results were recorded separately for the right eye, the left eye, and binocularly. The test results were presented graphically and numerically. The results of the examinations were in good agreement between the right and left eyes and also demonstrated good reproducibility between the three separate examinations. The alternating transparent light shutters did not cause any fixation problems for 10 subjects with phoria. The computerized dark <b>adaptometer</b> is by the 50 % reduction of examination time a relief for future patients without any expected loss of diagnostic information...|$|E
40|$|Dark adaptometry may be {{a useful}} {{diagnostic}} test and clinical trial endpoint for age-related maculopathy (ARM) because impaired night vision is a hallmark of early ARM. A novel dark <b>adaptometer,</b> the AdaptDx, was evaluated {{for the detection of}} ARM. The AdaptDx incorporates a 20 -minute protocol optimized for the detection of ARM. ARM patients (N[*]=[*] 17) exhibited substantial dark adaptation impairment compared with normal adults (N[*]=[*] 17). The diagnostic sensitivity was 88 % and the specificity was 100 %. The diagnostic test characteristics of the AdaptDx are similar to previously reported studies using 60 - to 120 -minute protocols...|$|E

40|$|Colour {{vision and}} dark {{adaptation}} of 36 high myopes (68 eyes) without degenerative fundus changes were studied {{with the standard}} pseudoisochromatic plates part 2, Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue (FM 100) test, Nagel anomaloscope, colour vision meter 712 -anomaloscope, and Goldmann-Weekers <b>adaptometer.</b> The ages of the myopes ranged from 20 to 49 years, the visual acuity from 6 / 12 to 6 / 6, and the refractions from - 6. 0 to - 20. 0 D. All the colour vision tests and dark adaptation examination gave normal results. However, the error scores of the myopes in (blue) box III of the FM 100 test {{were significantly higher than}} those of the controls matched for age. In dark adaptation, the rod thresholds of the myopes were significantly higher than in the controls.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} phenotypes in three Swedish families with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa caused by different mutations in the RPGR gene. METHODS: Three families from {{different parts of}} Sweden, including nine patients with retinitis pigmentosa and six female carriers of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, were examined clinically. Ophthalmologic examination included kinetic perimetry with a Goldmann perimeter using standardized objects I 4 e and V 4 e, dark adaptation final thresholds with a Goldmann-Weeker <b>adaptometer,</b> and full-field electroretinograms. RESULTS: The clinical findings in the patients demonstrated a severe form of retinitis pigmentosa with visual handicap early in life. Patients with a microdeletion of exons 8 through 10 of the RPGR gene had a more severe phenotype compared to the patients with single base-pair mutations in the introns 10 and 13 of the RPGR gene, resulting in splicing defects. Furthermore, heterozygous carriers in these families displayed a wide spectrum of clinical features, from minor symptoms to severe visual disability. CONCLUSION: These three families show a variable clinical phenotype resulting from different mutations in the RPGR gene. A microdeletion spanning at least parts of exons 8 through 10 seems to result in a severe phenotype compared to the splice defects. Heterozygous carriers of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa with these specific RPGR genotypes also show a variability of the phenotype; carriers with the microdeletion may be severely visually handicapped...|$|E
40|$|Background: Aberrant dark {{adaptation}} {{is common}} to many ocular diseases and pathophysiological conditions, including vitamin A deficiency, cardiopulmonary diseases, and hypoxia. Scotopic vision and pupillary responsiveness have typically been measured using subjective, time-consuming methods. Existing techniques are particularly challenging for use in developing country settings, where vitamin A deficiency remains a major public health problem. Our aim was design a compact, low cost, and easily operated device to assess dark adaptation in the field. Methods: The Portable Field Dark <b>Adaptometer</b> (PFDA) incorporates a digital camera, a retinal bleaching flash, and a Ganzfeld light source inside a pair of light-obscuring goggles. After a ~ 10 min period of dark adaption, the infrared camera digitally records afferent pupillary responses to graded light stimuli (− 2. 9 to 0. 1 log cd/m 2). We tested this device {{in a variety of}} field settings to assess: a) ease of use and b) whether test data could clearly and accurately depict the well-known dose-response relationship between light intensity and pupil contraction. A total of 822 videos were collected. We used an open source video analysis software to measure pupil size in pixel units. Pupillary responsiveness was expressed as the percent change in pupil size from pre- to post-light exposure. Box plots, t test, and multi-level mixed effects linear regression modeling were used to characterize the relationship between light intensity and pupillary response...|$|E
40|$|The {{course of}} foveal dark {{adaptation}} was studied {{as a function}} of the intensity and duration of preexposure. Four intensities (11, 300, 5, 650, 1, 130, and 565 mL.) and four durations (300, 150, 30, and 15 seconds) were used in all combinations of intensity and duration. The threshold-measuring instrument was a monocular Hecht-Shlaer <b>adaptometer</b> and the threshold measurements were recorded in log micromicrolamberts. There were two subjects and each went through the complete series of intensities and durations five times. The five logarithmic values obtained for each threshold were converted into a geometric mean and these means were the data used in the analysis of the results. The chief results were as follows:— 1. For each subject the final steady threshold value was in the region of 7. 0 log µµL. 2. As the intensity, or duration, or both, were increased the initial foveal dark adaptation threshold rose, the slope of the curve decreased, and the time to reach a final steady threshold value increased. 3. For those values of preexposure intensity and time for which the product, I x t, is a constant it was found that for the two higher intensities and two longer durations and also for the two lower intensities and two shorter durations, the dark adaptation curves were the same. For other values of I x t = C the curves were generally not the same...|$|E
40|$|Red {{interior}} lighting used to preserve dark-adaptation {{needs to be}} replaced in military applications by blue/green lighting which is not detectable by 3 rd-generation image intensifiers. This study investigated the influence of blue/green as compared to red and white light of equal photopic intensity on subsequent visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and dark-adaptation. Male subjects (n = 90) were {{assigned to one of}} 15 treatment conditions (n = 6) as determined by the colour (blue/green, red or white) and intensity (0. 1; 0. 4; 1. 6; 6. 4 and 25. 6 cd/m²) of the pre-adaptation stimuli. A modified Goldmann/Weekers <b>adaptometer</b> was used to present the preadaptation stimuli, test stimuli and record visual (luminance) thresholds of each subject. Blue/green lighting had the same affect on visual (photopic) acuity and contrast sensitivity as white and red lighting. Blue/green affected visual (absolute) threshold at the start and during the process of dark-adaptation {{in the same manner as}} white but not the same as red lighting. White and red lighting did not differ significantly (p < 0. 01) at low intensities (mesopic range) but did at the higher intensities (photopic range). After exposure to blue/green and white light, it will take longer to reach the same level of dark-adaptation than after exposure to red. These time differences increase with" increased intensities. The brightness ratio between red and white lights to produce the same dark-adaptation increases with an increase in intensity. At the upper mesopic region the differences between the effects of white and red lighting on subsequent dark-adaptation become irregular due to the inability to accurately equate non-monochromatic lights in the mesopic range. ...|$|E
40|$|AIMS—To characterise retinal {{function}} using electrophysiological and psychophysical {{tests in}} 17  patients with helicoidal peripapillary chorioretinal degeneration.  METHODS—The electroretinogram (ERG) was recorded using gold foil corneal electrodes. The electro-oculogram (EOG) was recorded using a standard protocol. Dark adaptometry was recorded with an SST- 1 dark <b>adaptometer</b> and colour vision assessed with Ishihara plates and Farnsworth D- 15.  RESULTS—All subjects had a recordable ERG. The amplitudes and implicit {{times of the}} a- and b-waves were within normal limits at all luminances in five subjects (age 21 - 70 years, mean 40  years). The ERG of six (age 26 - 55 years, mean 40. 7  years) had subnormal amplitudes at all luminances, but normal implicit times, and six (age 38 - 81 years, mean 60. 7  years) had abnormal ERGs with marked reduction of a- and b-waves, and delayed implicit times of the b-wave. The implicit times of the a-wave were normal in all subjects. A reduction in the b/a wave ratios was not found, nor was there selective loss of scotopic, mixed rod/cone, or cone responses. The light/dark ratio of the EOG was subnormal (150 - 185 %) or abnormal (below 150 %) in all but three subjects. Two patients with normal EOG showed normal ERGs in both eyes, but one had subnormal ERGs in both eyes. The scotopic sensitivity was normal in all subjects and dark adaptation showed a normal time course. Colour vision was normal in all patients.  CONCLUSION—The results suggest that {{in most cases the}} function of the retinal pigment epithelium is affected by this disease before any changes in the function of the sensory retina are detectable by our methods, and that retinal dysfunction is focal rather than diffuse.    Keywords: chorioretinal degeneration; electroretinogram; dark adaptation; colour visio...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. Although an {{extraordinary}} visual acuity is achieved following the extracapsular cataract extraction with the implantation of intraocular lens, {{all the problems}} of vision are not solved in so doing {{and many of them}} should be considered. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish the influence of age, dioptric power of intraocular lens, corneal astigmatism and optic diameter of intraocular lens on glare in pseudophakic subjects. Methods. We examined 152 patients who underwent final correction at least two weeks after the suture removing what was performed if the astigmatism more than 2. 0 D was measured by the use of a Javal keratometer. Examination was performed by a Rodenstock <b>Adaptometer</b> Nyctomat. According to the recommendation of the manufacturer, healthy persons should notice 50 % of contrast under the constant glare and in the given time. Statistical data processing was performed by χ 2 test. Results. In the group of patients with the findings lower than normal at constant glare there were 112 of eyes (73. 68 %) as follows: 22 eyes (14. 47 %) at the age from 50 - 55 years; 15 eyes (9. 87 %) were at the age from 56 - 60 years; 18 eyes (11. 84 %) were at the age from 61 - 65 years, and 57 eyes (37. 50 %) were at the age from 66 - 70 years. Dioptric power of lenses up to 20. 0 D had 37 eyes (24. 3 %), from 20. 5 - 22. 0 D 85 eyes (56. 9 %) and more than 22. 5 D, 27 eyes (17. 8 %). Regarding the results of discomfort caused by glare and corneal astigmatism, measured by a Javal keratometer, in the observed group normal results were found in 112 eyes (73. 68 %), and out of that number 95 (62. 50 %) were with corneal astigmatism less than 20. 0 D, and 17 (11. 18 %) had astigmatism of 20. 0 D and more. Out of 112 eyes there were 58 of them (38. 16 %) with findings lower than normal in relation to the constant glare and with the lens diameter of 5. 5 mm, 48 (31. 58 %) with the lens diameter of 6. 0 mm, and 6 of them (3. 95 %) with lens diameter of 6. 5 mm. Conclusion. The study determined a significant statistical correlation between the dioptric power of lenses and the glare. The obtained results did not find out a significant increase in glare in relation to the age of subjects, optic diameter and corneal astigmatism...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Purpose A cathode-ray-tube (CRT) monitor–based {{technique}} {{was used to}} isolate clinically significant components of dark adaptation. The utility of the technique in identifying adaptation abnormalities in eyes with age-related maculopathy (ARM) is described. Methods A CRT dark <b>adaptometer</b> was developed to assess cone and rod recovery after photopigment bleach. The following measures were obtained: cone recovery rate (R c; in decades per minute) and absolute threshold (Tf c; log candelas per square meter), rod recovery rate (R r; decades per minute), and rod–cone transition (rod–cone break [RCB], in minutes). These components were isolated by appropriately selecting stimulus size, stimulus location, pigment bleach, and test duration and by coupling the CRT with judiciously selected neutral-density (ND) filters. The protocol was developed by using 5 young observers and was tested on 27 subjects with ARM in the study eye and 22 age-matched control subjects. Results The parameters necessary for effective isolation of cone and early phase rod dark adaptation were a 2. 6 ND filter (for a standard CRT monitor, 0. 08 – 80 cd · m − 2 luminance output); a 4 ° foveated, 200 -ms, achromatic spot; ∼ 30 % pigment bleaching; and a 30 -minute test duration. These settings returned obvious rod and cone recovery curves in control and ARM eyes that were compatible with conventional test methods and identified 93 % of participants with ARM as having delayed dynamics {{in at least one}} of the parameters. Cone recovery dynamics were significantly slower in the ARM group when compared with age-matched control subjects (R c, 0. 99 ± 0. 35 vs. 2. 63 ± 0. 61 decades · min − 1, P < 0. 0001). Three of the 27 eyes with ARM did not achieve RCB during the allowed duration (30 minutes). The remaining eyes with ARM (n = 24) exhibited a significant delay in rod recovery (R r, ARM, 0. 16 ± 0. 03 vs. controls, 0. 22 ± 0. 02 decades · min − 1, P < 0. 0001) and the average time to RCB (±SD) in the ARM group was significantly longer than in the control subjects (19. 12 ± 5. 17 minutes vs. 10. 40 ± 2. 49 minutes, P < 0. 0001). Conclusions The CRT dark-adaptation technique described in this article is an effective test for identifying abnormalities in cone and rod recovery. Slowed cone and rod recovery and a delayed RCB were evident in the eyes with ARM. The test method is potentially useful for clinical intervention trials in which ARM progression is monitored. </p...|$|E
