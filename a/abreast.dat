5|$|The 767 {{features}} a twin-aisle cabin with a typical configuration of six <b>abreast</b> in business class and seven across in economy. The standard seven <b>abreast,</b> 2–3–2 economy class layout places approximately 87percent of all seats at a window or aisle. As a result, the aircraft can be largely occupied before center seats {{need to be}} filled, and each passenger {{is no more than}} one seat from the aisle. It is possible to configure the aircraft with extra seats for up to an eight <b>abreast</b> configuration, but this is less common.|$|E
5|$|The initial attacks at Megiddo and Amiens were by {{infantry}} divisions deployed two brigades <b>abreast,</b> with a {{third in}} reserve.|$|E
5|$|Premium Laurel class seating is in a 2–2–2 <b>abreast</b> {{arrangement}} on the Boeing 777, Boeing 747 (2–2 in {{the forward}} nose section), and A330. In 2016, Premium Laurel was upgraded to the new B/E Aerospace seats in a 2-2-2 configuration.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns were installed <b>abreast</b> the aft funnel. In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck <b>abreast</b> 'B' turret. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a tetrapodal mast, which was moved forward of the funnels, the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ships were equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret. Around that same time, {{one or both of the}} ships was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the port side of the forecastle.|$|E
5|$|The {{sides of}} the conning tower were 11inches thick {{and it had a}} 3-inch roof of KNC. It had a {{communications}} tube with 8inch walls of mild steel down to the Transmitting Station on the middle deck. The walls of the signal tower were 8inches thick while it had a roof of 3inches of KNC armour. 2inch torpedo bulkheads were fitted <b>abreast</b> the magazines and shell rooms of 'A', 'X' and 'Y' turrets, but this increased to 4inches <b>abreast</b> 'P' and 'Q' turrets to compensate for their outboard location.|$|E
5|$|Around 6:30pm the {{soldiers}} of the 6th Regiment began assembling. Their armory, located on Front Street across from the Phoenix Shot Tower, consisted of {{the second and third}} floors of a warehouse, with the only exit being a narrow stairway through which no more than two men could walk <b>abreast.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the German ships {{approached}} Glorious, Acasta, {{which had}} been trying to maintain the smokescreen, broke through her own smoke and fired two volleys of torpedoes at Scharnhorst. One of these hit the battleship at 17:34 <b>abreast</b> her rear turret and badly damaged her. Acasta also managed one hit from her 4.7-inch guns on Scharnhorst, but was riddled by German gunfire and sank at around 18:20.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of his}} {{business}} career, Romney did not take public, political stances. He had kept <b>abreast</b> of national politics since college, though, and {{the circumstances of his}} father's presidential campaign loss had irked him for decades. He registered as an Independent and voted in the 1992 presidential primaries for the Democratic former senator from Massachusetts, Paul Tsongas.|$|E
5|$|Some {{humanitarian}} {{organizations like}} Ears to Our World distribute portable, self-powered shortwave radios to less developed {{parts of the}} globe, enabling people in remote, impoverished {{parts of the world}} to get educational programming, local and international news, emergency information and music. Recently, the group was involved in sending radios to Haiti so victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake could stay <b>abreast</b> of local disaster recovery efforts.|$|E
5|$|Courageous carried four BL 15-inch Mk I guns in two {{hydraulically}} powered twin gun turrets, designated 'A' and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen BL 4-inch Mk IX guns mounted in six manually powered mounts. The mount placed three breeches too close together, causing the 23 loaders to get in one another's way, and preventing the intended high rate of fire. A pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted <b>abreast</b> the mainmast on Courageous. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and carried 10 torpedoes for them.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{a pair of}} 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns on high-angle mounts were fitted as {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns, one gun at the bow and {{the other}} on top of 'X' turret. In 1925 the number of 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter guns were installed <b>abreast</b> the aft funnel. Two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were also fitted. In 1926 the rangefinders were upgraded and a fixed aircraft catapult was mounted on the port side of the forecastle for a Macchi M.18 seaplane.|$|E
5|$|During production, Hergé kept <b>abreast</b> of the {{turbulent}} political developments in Tibet. In March 1959, Tibet's foremost political and spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, fled the region into self-imposed exile in India during the 1959 Tibetan uprising. In May 2001, when Tintin in Tibet {{was published in}} China, state authorities renamed it Tintin in Chinese Tibet. When Casterman and the Hergé Foundation protested, the authorities restored the book's original title.|$|E
5|$|Fairfax {{wrote that}} his second-in-command, Major-General Lambert, {{could not get}} up to him, and so charged in another place. A lane, the present-day Atterwith Lane, crossed the ditch on this flank, and some {{accounts}} suggest that several units were easy targets for the Royalist musketeers as they advanced along the lane only four <b>abreast.</b> When a small embankment alongside the ditch at this point was removed in the 1960s, several hundred musket balls were recovered.|$|E
5|$|Glorious carried four BL 15-inch (381mm) Mark I guns in two twin-gun turrets, {{one each}} fore ('A') and aft ('Y'). Her {{secondary}} armament was 18 BL 4-inch (102mm) Mark IX guns mounted in six triple mounts. These mounts had the three breeches too close {{together and the}} 23 loaders tended to interfere with one another. This negated the mount's intended high rate of fire against torpedo boats and other smaller craft. A pair of QF 3-inch (76mm) 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted <b>abreast</b> of the mainmast on Glorious. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and 10 torpedoes were carried.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945, {{removal of}} two quadruple torpedo tubes was {{authorized}} to permit substitution of two 40mm quad mounts. In June, {{removal of the}} third centerline tube was authorized {{to make way for}} two 40mm twin mounts <b>abreast</b> of the aft stack. All ships receiving these AA modifications were to have directors installed with their new 40mm mounts; these Mark 51s were to be replaced by new blind-firing GFFC Mark 63 installations with radar.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the storm}} posed {{a threat to}} Florida, where {{military}} officials kept <b>abreast</b> of the situation. Heavy surf advisories were posted from central portions of the state northward to Georgia, and the National Hurricane Center advised that swimming and boating should be avoided. The Mayport Naval Station ordered 25ships out to sea {{in advance of the}} approaching storm. The Salvation Army was on standby in Jacksonville, prepared to act when needed. Hardware stores in the state reported up to a 75% increase in the sales of emergency supplies.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} scored {{four hits}} and three near misses on and around Arizona. The near miss off the port bow {{is believed to}} have caused observers to believe that the ship had been torpedoed, although no torpedo damage has been found. The sternmost bomb ricocheted off the face of Turret IV and penetrated the deck to detonate in the captain's pantry, causing a small fire. The next forwardmost hit was near the port edge of the ship, <b>abreast</b> the mainmast, probably detonating {{in the area of the}} anti-torpedo bulkhead. The next bomb struck near the port rear 5-inch AA gun.|$|E
5|$|The {{armoured}} belt {{consisted of}} face-hardened Krupp cemented armour (KC), arranged in three strakes. The main waterline belt was 12inches (305mm) thick between 'A' and 'Y' barbettes and thinned to 5 to 6inches (127 to 152mm) towards the ship's ends, {{but did not}} reach either the bow or the stern. The middle armour belt had a maximum thickness of 7inches (178mm) over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to five inches <b>abreast</b> 'A' barbette. The upper belt was 5inches thick amidships and extended forward to 'A' barbette, with a short 4-inch (102mm) extension aft.|$|E
5|$|The rear turrets, the barbettes {{and their}} {{supporting}} structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the {{openings in the}} middle deck were covered by 152mm plates salvaged from the turret armour. All of the 14cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off. Four additional twin 12.7cm mounts were added, one pair <b>abreast</b> the funnel and the other <b>abreast</b> the conning tower. The original ten twin 25mm gun mounts were replaced by triple mounts and nine new triple mounts were added, a total of 57 guns. Two each Type 94 and Type 95 AA directors were added to control the additional guns. The ammunition for these new guns was stored in the magazines originally used for the 14cm guns and for Turret No. 5. During 1944, the ships' AA defences were reinforced with an additional dozen triple and eleven single 25mm gun mounts, {{for a total of}} 104 barrels, and a pair of Type 13 early warning radars were added. In September six 30-round AA rocket launchers were added {{on the sides of the}} flight deck.|$|E
5|$|Union troops retreated in {{different}} states of order. The brigades on Seminary Ridge {{were said to}} move deliberately and slowly, keeping in control, although Col. Wainwright's artillery was not informed of the order to retreat and found themselves alone. When Wainwright realized his situation, he ordered his gun crews to withdraw at a walk, not wishing to panic the infantry and start a rout. As pressure eventually increased, Wainwright ordered his 17 remaining guns to gallop down Chambersburg Street, three <b>abreast.</b> A.P. Hill failed to commit any of his reserves {{to the pursuit of}} the Seminary defenders, a great missed opportunity.|$|E
5|$|After roll call, the Kommando, or work details, {{walked to}} {{their place of}} work, five <b>abreast,</b> wearing striped camp fatigues, no underwear, and ill-fitting wooden shoes without socks. A prisoner's {{orchestra}} (such as the Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz) was forced to play cheerful music as the workers left the camp. Kapos {{were responsible for the}} prisoners' behavior while they worked, as was an SS escort. The working day lasted 12 hours during the summer and a little less in the winter. Much of the work took place outdoors at construction sites, gravel pits, and lumber yards. No rest periods were allowed. One prisoner was assigned to the latrines to measure the time the workers took to empty their bladders and bowels.|$|E
5|$|Christy {{could have}} {{graduated}} in 1940, {{but could not}} then be a teaching assistant, and this would have left him jobless and without income. In 1941, Oppenheimer found him a post at the physics department at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). In May 1941, he married Dagmar von Lieven. They had two sons: Thomas Edward (Ted), born in 1944, and Peter Robert, born in 1946. IIT paid Christy $200 per month to teach 27 hours per week for 11 months per annum. To keep <b>abreast</b> of developments in physics, he attended seminars at the University of Chicago. This {{brought him to the}} attention of Eugene Wigner, who hired him for the same money that IIT was paying him as a full-time research assistant, commencing in January 1942.|$|E
5|$|Earnhardt {{moved back}} into the lead on lap 68, when Vickers' right-front tire blew in the tri-oval on the same lap, {{starting}} a multi-car accident involving Gilliland, Truex, Kahne, Skinner, McMurray, Terry Labonte, Raines and Almirola. A fourth caution was triggered initially because of the accident before a red-flag was shown shortly afterward to stop the race to allow officials to clear the track of debris. The race resumed seventeen minutes later as the field elected to make pit stops. Earnhardt led on the lap-72 restart, followed by Menard, Burton, Harvick and Montoya. By lap 74, Montoya had the lead before Hamlin passed him at the start-finish line to lead the lap. Johnson moved {{to the front of}} the field two laps later, before losing the lead to teammate Earnhardt on lap 78 as the pack ran three <b>abreast</b> at the start-finish line.|$|E
5|$|Garrard was {{regarded}} as a strong chief executive who surrounded himself with knowledgeable advisors. His friend, John Edwards, and his son, William Garrard, were both in the state senate and kept him <b>abreast</b> of issues there. He showed {{that he was willing to}} continue with Shelby's direction for the state by re-appointing Secretary of State James Brown, but the aging Brown retired in October 1796, only a few months into Garrard's term. Garrard then appointed Harry Toulmin, who had resigned the presidency of Transylvania Seminary in April due to opposition from the institution's more conservative trustees. Although he did not retain outgoing Attorney General John Breckinridge, who had sided with Logan in the disputed gubernatorial election, Garrard still frequently consulted with him on complex legal questions.|$|E
5|$|HMS Swordfish was {{developed}} to meet a requirement of Royal Navy's Submarine Committee for a large submarine capable of operating with the fleet at a surfaced speed of 20 knots. Most of the earlier British submarines had been single-hulled vessels built by Vickers, and the Navy was interested in evaluating other designs. Captain Roger Keyes, Inspecting Captain of Submarines, had previously served as naval attaché in Italy and had kept <b>abreast</b> of Italian submarine developments, which notably included double-hulled submarines designed by Cesare Laurenti of Fiat-San Giorgio. Three boats of the S class were ordered first and Laurenti was invited to submit a design to meet the RN requirement.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} fiscal years 1941 and 1942, {{the federal government}} partially funded the education of 12,000 students at 309 nursing schools. Through that initiative, 3,800 inactive nurses received refresher courses and 4,800 graduated nurses received postgraduate training. By the end of 1942, 47,500 students were enrolled in nursing schools {{but that did not}} meet the country's need. At this point, it was clear that nurses could not be trained quickly enough to keep <b>abreast</b> of both civilian and military needs. The need for additional federal aid for the recruitment of nurses became apparent when the U.S. Army and Navy called for 2,500 new nurses each month during the fiscal year 1943.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's tenure on the Committee on Naval Affairs {{came during}} a time of great {{innovation}} in naval warfare. He kept <b>abreast</b> of developments in other navies, and he made sure that the U.S. Navy would incorporate the latest thinking into its new ships. Britain and France, then the two foremost navies in the world, {{were in the process of}} converting their fleets from sail to steam, and from paddles to screws. In 1853, the committee recommended passage of a bill providing for the addition of six new screw frigates to the fleet; when delivered, some considered them to be the best frigates in the world. In 1857, his committee persuaded the Senate to authorize twelve sloops-of-war. These entered the navy beginning in 1858, on the verge of the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March, Bouvet, {{along with}} , Suffren, and Gaulois, was {{to attack the}} Dardanelles fortresses. The plan called for six British pre-dreadnoughts to {{suppress}} the Turkish fortifications, after which the French battleships would attack those same fortifications at close range. The French fleet was commanded by Admiral Émile Guépratte; the acting Allied commander was Rear Admiral John de Robeck, who stood in for Admiral Sackville Carden. The Allied battleships were arranged in line <b>abreast,</b> in three rows; Bouvet was stationed {{in the center of}} the second row. The force entered the straits at 11:30 and bombarded the town of Çanakkale, before turning to the Fortress Hamidieh and other nearby fortifications at 13:30.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns were installed <b>abreast</b> the aft funnel. In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a four-legged mast, which was moved forward of the funnels, the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ship was equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret. Around that same time she was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the port side of the forecastle.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} a Dive Coaster can vary {{slightly}} from one to another. Depending on the amusement park's request, one row on the train can seat anywhere from 6 to 10 riders. Stadium seating {{is also used to}} give every rider a clear view. Next, compared to standard Bolliger & Mabillard 4 <b>abreast</b> cars, because of the extra weight of each car on a Dive Coaster, the size of the track must be larger than other B models (such as the Hyper Coaster) to support the weight. At the top of the primary vertical drop, a braking system holds the train for 3 to 5 seconds, giving riders a view of the drop ahead before being released into the drop.|$|E
5|$|The historians David Glantz and Jonathan House {{asserted}} that the original intention of the 4th Panzer Army command was to drive northwards, with its two panzer corps driving <b>abreast,</b> toward Oboyan and then Kursk; but that on 9 July, due to heavy Soviet resistance {{along the road to}} Oboyan, Hoth was forced to disastrously, although not knowing it at the time, alter his plan by ordering the II SS-Panzer Corps to swing from the northwesterly direction to the northeast toward Prokhorovka. Therefore, according to Glantz and House, the Battle of Prokhorova was not a result of original intention nor planned for, but was rather engendered by tactically flawed, late improvisations to the original German plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} main battery of four 12-inch/40 caliber Mark 4 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The {{secondary}} battery consisted of eight 8-inch/45 caliber guns and twelve /50 caliber Mark 6 guns. The 8-inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets; two of these were superposed atop the main battery turrets, {{with the other two}} turrets <b>abreast</b> the forward funnel. The 6-inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twelve /50 caliber guns, mounted in casemates {{along the side of the}} hull, and twelve 3-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, Nebraska carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.|$|E

5|$|Thi {{demanded that}} Diệm appoint an officer as prime {{minister}} and that Diệm remove Madame Nhu from the palace. Saigon Radio broadcast a speech authorised by Thi's Revolutionary Council, claiming that Diệm was being removed because he was corrupt and suppressed liberty. Worried by the uprising, Diệm sent his private secretary Vo Van Hai {{to negotiate with the}} coup leaders. In the afternoon, Khanh left the palace to meet with rebel officers to keep <b>abreast</b> of their demands, which they reiterated. The rebels' negotiators were Đông and Major Nguyen Huy Loi. They wanted officers and opposition figures to be appointed to a new government to keep Diệm in check.|$|E
