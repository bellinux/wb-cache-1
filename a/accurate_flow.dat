40|$|Handling large {{displacement}} {{optical flow}} is a remarkably arduous task. For instance, standard coarse-to-fine techniques often struggle to adequately deal with moving objects whose motion exceeds their size. Here we propose a learning {{approach to the}} estimation of large displacement between two non-consecutive images in a sequence {{on the basis of}} a learning set of optical flows estimated a priori between different consecutive images in the same sequence. Our method refines an initial estimate of the flow field by replacing each displacement vector by a linear combination of displacement vectors at the center of similar patches taken from a code-book built from the learning set. The key idea is to use the <b>accurate</b> <b>flows</b> estimated a priori between consecutive images to help improve the potentially less <b>accurate</b> <b>flows</b> estimated online between images further apart. Experimental results suggest the ability of a purely data-driven learning approach to handle fine scale structures with large displacements...|$|R

50|$|The {{required}} pressure for administrating the drug {{comes from the}} elastomeric layer that is molded inside the pump. When the pump is filled the layer is stretched. The elastic constriction drives the liquid through the tubing and eventually through a flow restrictor out into the patient connection. The pressure is consistent until {{near the end of}} the infusion, when there will usually be a pressure spike resulting in a higher flow rate. The accuracy of the flow rate is controlled by a flow restrictor (glass capillary or steel cannula) that is molded into the tubing of the system or placed within the elastomeric reservoir. Elastomeric pumps do not require any electricity and are not gravity driven. When placed above or below the patient, flow rate is typically increased or decreased slightly (head height effect). Filling the pump is done manually through a one-way valve using a syringe or peristaltic repeater pump. Elastomeric pumps are known for their reliability and <b>accurate</b> <b>flow</b> rate. Elastomeric pumps are maintenance free and run independently without any electronics, and are typically single-use disposable. Depending on the pumps's size the drug inside the pump can be delivered over a time spread varying between thirty minutes to seven days.|$|E
30|$|Some {{differences}} in Renkin-Crone fits {{can also be}} explained by the flow estimation method. For instance, [11] used 13 N-ammonia to measure MBF, which has a lower extraction fraction than 15 O-water and will hence underestimate MBF. Using unweighted ODR to fit the data instead of weighted ODR resulted in higher parameter estimates (Additional file 1 : Figure S 10). Average MBFs were similar regardless of IDIF correction because water-based flows were unaffected by IDIF scaling and extraction parameters were estimated separately for each case. Therefore, <b>accurate</b> <b>flows</b> can be determined for 82 Rb with or without IDIF correction, if extraction parameters have been estimated from data processed similarly. This suggests that modeling choices could have greater impact on extraction fraction estimates than TOF and PSF modeling, though TOF/PSF-based kinetic parameters have lower standard error.|$|R

The thin layer form of the compressible Navier-Stokes equation is used.

Flux difference splitting predicts results more accurately than flux vector splitting on a given mesh size, but, in its present implementation, is more severely limited by the maximum CFL number for unsteady time <b>accurate</b> <b>flows.</b> Physical aspects of the computations are also examined.
