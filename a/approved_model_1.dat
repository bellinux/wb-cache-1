40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{an original}} 2 -valued semantics for Normal Logic Programs (NLPs) extending the well-known Argumentation work of Phan Minh Dung on Admissible Arguments and Preferred Extensions. In the 2 -valued <b>Approved</b> <b>Models</b> Semantics set forth, an <b>Approved</b> <b>Model</b> (AM) {{correspond to the}} minimal positive strict consistent 2 -valued completion of a Dung Preferred Extension. The AMs Semantics enjoys several non-trivial useful properties such as (1) Existence of a 2 -valued Model for every NLP; (2) Relevancy, and (3) Cumulativity. Crucially, we show that the AMs Semantics is a conservative extension to the Stable Models (SMs) Semantics {{in the sense that}} every SM of a NLP is also an AM, thus providing every NLP with a model: a property not enjoyed by SMs. Integrity constraints, written in a simpler way, are introduced to identify undesired semantic scenarios, whilst permitting these to be produced nevertheless. We end the paper with some conclusions and mention of future work. ...|$|R

The asset {{and liability}} management models in the literature are reviewed {{with an emphasis on}} the recently developed approaches. In most of the recent models, the uncertainty is described by a representative set of scenarios. The validity of the Gaussian assumption in scenario generation is questioned, and stable Paretian distribution is suggested as an alternativehypothesis. ######## 1. 1. Introduction 1. 2.

40|$|IBM <b>Model</b> <b>1</b> is a {{classical}} alignment model. Of {{the first generation}} word-based SMT models, {{it was the only}} such model with a concave objective function. For concave optimization problems like IBM <b>Model</b> <b>1,</b> we have guarantees on the con-vergence of optimization algorithms such as Expectation Maximization (EM). How-ever, as was pointed out recently, the ob-jective of IBM <b>Model</b> <b>1</b> is not strictly con-cave and there is quite a bit of alignment quality variance within the optimal solu-tion set. In this work we detail a strictly concave version of IBM <b>Model</b> <b>1</b> whose EM algorithm is a simple modification of the original EM algorithm of <b>Model</b> <b>1</b> and does not require the tuning of a learning rate or the insertion of an l 2 penalty.

3000|$|In Table  3, {{to examine}} the {{significance}} of <b>Model</b> (<b>1)</b> accompanied {{with a total of}} six predictor variables, the likelihood ratio test was carried out. In contrast with <b>Model</b> (<b>1),</b> the null hypothesis model including only the intercept term can be estimated. In the likelihood ratio test, the deviance difference between <b>Model</b> (<b>1)</b> and the null hypothesis model is calculated as Chi-Sq (χ^ 2) = D_Fitted [...] ([...] 1 [...])–D_Null  =  197.967 and P value =  0.000 *** where D_Fitted [...] ([...] 1 [...]) and D_Null denote the deviance of <b>Model</b> (<b>1)</b> and the null hypothesis model respectively. Hence, the null hypothesis model can be rejected, and <b>Model</b> (<b>1)</b> is determined to be significant. In summary, all three <b>models</b> from <b>Model</b> (<b>1)</b> to <b>Model</b> (3) achieve the model significance based on the likelihood ratio test statistics.|$|R
