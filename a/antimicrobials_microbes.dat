5000|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} (AMR) is {{the ability}} of a microbe to resist the effects of medication previously used to treat them. [...] This broader term also covers antibiotic resistance, which applies to bacteria and antibiotics. Resistance arises through one of three ways: natural resistance in certain types of bacteria, genetic mutation, or by one species acquiring resistance from another. Resistance can appear spontaneously because of random mutations; or more commonly following gradual buildup over time, and because of misuse of antibiotics or <b>antimicrobials.</b> Resistant <b>microbes</b> are increasingly difficult to treat, requiring alternative medications or higher doses, both of which may be more expensive or more toxic. Microbes resistant to multiple antimicrobials are called multidrug resistant (MDR); or sometimes superbugs. Antimicrobial resistance is on the rise with millions of deaths every year. All classes of microbes develop resistance: fungi develop antifungal resistance, viruses develop antiviral resistance, protozoa develop antiprotozoal resistance, and bacteria develop antibiotic resistance.|$|R

DNase or the anticoagulant heparin dismantled the NET scaffold and prevented thrombus formation. Stimulation of platelets with purified histones was sufficient for aggregation. NETs recruited red blood cells, promoted fibrin deposition, and induced a red thrombus, such as that found in veins. Markers of extracellular DNA traps were detected in a thrombus and plasma of baboons subjected to deep vein thrombosis, an example of inflammation-enhanced thrombosis.

The burden of food borne illness is worsened by the ever increasing rate of <b>antimicrobial</b> resistance <b>microbes.</b> Shigella, a bacterial pathogen associated with food, is reported to account for higher prevalence rates of food borne illness in different settings. A cross-sectional study was conducted from February 10 to June 30, 2013, at the butcher houses of Gondar town in the Northwest of Ethiopia to assess the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Shigella. Cattle raw meat and swab samples from selected critical control points, including knives, chopping boards, and the hands and noses of butchers, were collected and analyzed. The identification of Shigella was carried out using colony characteristics, the Gram reaction, and biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion method. The overall hygienic status of the butcher shops was also assessed using a checklist. An observational analysis revealed that the sanitary condition of the butcher shops and their premises was poor. Of 306 samples screened, 10. 5 % were positive for Shigella. Approximately 7. 4 % of meat samples and 10. 2 % of swab samples were contaminated with Shigella. Out of the total Shigella isolates, 90. 6 %, 46. 9 %, 18. 8 % and 9. 4 % were resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone and tetracycline, respectively. A multidrug resistance pattern was recorded in 27. 8 % of the isolates. In conclusion, the safety of meat sold at Gondar butchers houses was poor. The identified Shigella isolates showed high levels of drug resistance and multidrug resistance patterns for commonly used antimicrobials in veterinary and human medicine. Practicing wise use of antimicrobials and strict sanitary interventions at different critical control points is strongly recommended, in addition to further in-depth studies to prevent unprecedented consequences from shigellosis...|$|R

Nevertheless, in recent decades antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a growing threat for both human and animals. In 2014, a report of the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance estimated that antimicrobial resistance could cause 10 million deaths a year by 2050. Recently the emergence of colistin-resistant enterobacteria rendered infections caused by these bacteria as untreatable. These bacteria were designated Superbugs as they are resistant to all known <b>antimicrobials.</b> Commensal <b>microbes</b> that live on and in us are critical for our health, as this microbiome is like a filter between us and the world. Microbiome studies have clarified that microorganism exchange happens between people who cohabit certain spaces and even between animals and people living in the same environment. It is also well known that the consumption of food products of animal origin may provide access of microorganisms from the animal's microbiome to the consumer body. Bacteria may transmit resistance genes to each other through the conjugation process, one of the DNA transfer processes. Therefore, when acquiring resistant bacteria, both humans and animals, there may be transmission of resistance genes to other microorganisms that inhabit the own organism and, thus, the individual may develop antimicrobials resistant populations in his particular microbiome. Therefore, food products of animal origin may constitute a route of transmitting resistant bacteria and resistance genes from animals to people. Direct contact with animals or the animal environment may also be responsible for transmission. Fruits and vegetables contaminated by animal waste or contaminated water may similarly constitute a transmission route. Several multi drug resistance (MDR) pathogenic bacteria are shared between companion animals and humans. These organisms spread between animals and humans, although the direction of transfer is often difficult to prove. To control AMR a rational antimicrobial use must be followed. Antimicrobial stewardship refers to coordinated interventions designed to improve and measure the appropriate use of antimicrobials.

Methodology: A cross-sectional study involving collection of clinical bacteria isolates within Dar es Salaam, and determine the susceptibility profiles of the isolates as well as the prevalence of antibiotic resistant isolates. The tested microbes were collected from three main sources namely Regency Medical Centre, Hindu Mandal and Massana Hospitals. The isolates were tested against 8 antibiotic using 96 -well microtiter-plates. Microdilution method was employed in testing the isolates using Muller-Hinton broth against 8 selected commonly used antibiotics. Results: A total of 54 clinical isolates were collected from various sources viz. urine (72. 2 %), stool (135 %), blood (1. 9 %), HVS (5. 6 %), pus (5. 6 %) and sputum (1. 9 %) etc. Of these, majority (52 %) composed of E. coli isolates, others include Klebsiella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Salmonella and Proteus spp. Different drug concentrations were used ranging from 0. 001 to 64 mg/ ml, yielding various MIC ranging from 0. 001 to 106. 6 mg/ ml. The most susceptible microbe was Salmonella and Streptococcus, while the most effective antibiotics to majority of the assayed microbes were gentamycin and ciprofloxacin.

Materials and methods: Ninety-six specimens made from bovine incisors were divided into four groups and incubated with one of four aspiration pneumonia-causative bacteria. Each group was further divided into six subgroups according to treatment as follows: control group (DW), chlorhexidine gluconate solution group (CHX), WOA group (WOA), ultrasonic treatment in distilled water group (DW-U), ultrasonic treatment in chlorhexidine gluconate solution group (CHX-U) or ultrasonic treatment in WOA group (WOA-U). After treatment, the levels of viable microbes in the biofilm were evaluated by quantitative adenosine triphosphate analysis and compared among the six groups.

Here, we clearly {{demonstrated that the}} embryo extract of zebrafish and its early embryo both displayed <b>antimicrobial</b> activity against <b>microbes,</b> including pathogenic Aeromonas hydrophila, and phosvitin (Pv), a nutritional protein abundant in eggs, was related to this antimicrobial activity. We also showed that recombinant Pv (rPv) acted as a pattern recognition receptor capable of recognizing the microbial signature molecules LPS, lipoteichoic acid, and peptidoglycan, as well as binding the Gram-negative and -positive microbes Escherichia coli, A. hydrophila, and Staphylococcus aureus and functioned as an antimicrobial agent capable of killing the microbes. Furthermore, we revealed that its C-terminal 55 residues (Pt 5) with the functional sites Arg 242 and Ala 201 /Ile 203 were indispensable for Pv antimicrobial activity. Importantly, microinjection of rPv or Pt 5 into early embryos significantly enhanced their resistance to A. hydrophila challenge, and this enhanced bacterial resistance was markedly reduced by co-injection of anti-Pv antibody plus rPv (or Pt 5) but not by injection of anti-actin antibody plus rPv. Moreover, the generated mutants with in vitro antimicrobial activity, when injected into the embryos, could also promote their resistance to A. hydrophila, but those without in vitro antimicrobial activity could not. It is thus proposed that Pv participates in the protection of early embryos against pathogenic attacks via binding and disrupting potential pathogens.

As the NIH Human Microbiome Project continues to better characterize the human metagenome, new insights into autoimmune pathogenesis are beginning to emerge. Content...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} one-pot {{synthesis}} of spherical gold nanoparticles (52 - 22 nm) and their capping with cefaclor, a second-generation antibiotic, without {{use of other}} chemicals. The differently sized gold nanoparticles were fabricated by controlling the rate of reduction of gold ions in aqueous solution by varying the reaction temperature (20 - 70 C). The primary amine group of cefaclor acted as both the reducing and capping agent for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles leaving the b-lactam ring of cefaclor available for activity against <b>microbes.</b> <b>Antimicrobial</b> testing showed that cefaclor reduced gold nanoparticles have potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria as compared to cefaclor or gold nanoparticles alone. The minimum inhibition concentrations (MICs) of cefaclor reduced gold nanoparticles were 10 m gmL 1 and 100 m gmL 1 for S. aureus and E. coli respectively. The cefaclor reduced gold nanoparticles were further coated onto poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) modified glass surfaces to obtain antimicrobial coatings suitable for biomedical applications and were tested against E. coli as an exemplar of activity. The antimicrobial coatings were very robust under adverse conditions (pH 3 and 10), inhibited the growth of E. coli on their surfaces, and could be used many times with retained activity. Results from a combined spectroscopic (FTIR) and microscopic study (AFM) suggest that the action of these novel particles is through the combined action of cefaclor inhibiting the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer and gold nanoparticles generating "holes" in bacterial cell walls thereby increasing the permeability of the cell wall, resulting in the leakage of cell contents and eventually cell death...|$|R
40|$|Intravascular catheter-associated {{bloodstream}} infections {{significantly increase}} rates of morbidity and hospital costs. Microbial colonization {{and development of}} biofilms, which {{are known to be}} recalcitrant to antibiotic therapy, often lead to the loss of otherwise patent vascular access systems. We evaluated a new taurolidine- and citrate-based catheter lock solution (Neutrolin; Biolink Corporation, Norwell, Mass.) for its activity against planktonic <b>microbes,</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> activity in a catheter model, and biofilm eradication activity. In studies of planktonic microbes, after 24 h of contact, 675 mg of taurolidine-citrate solution per liter caused > 99 % reductions in the initial counts of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Entercoccus faecalis. A solution of 13, 500 mg/liter was cidal for Candida albicans. Ports and attached catheters inoculated with 50 to 600 CFU of these bloodstream isolates per ml were locked with heparin or the taurolidine-citrate solution. After 72 h, there was no growth in the taurolidine-citrate-treated devices but the heparin-treated devices exhibited growth in the range of 6 × 102 to 5 × 106 CFU/ml. Biofilms were developed on silicone disks in modified Robbins devices with broth containing 6 % serum (initial counts, 106 to 108 CFU/cm 2). The axenic biofilms were treated for 24 h with taurolidine-citrate or heparin. Taurolidine-citrate exposure resulted in a median reduction of 4. 8 logs, whereas heparin treatment resulted in a median reduction of 1. 7 logs (P < 0. 01). No significant differences in the effects of the two treatments against P. aeruginosa and C. albicans were observed. These findings suggest that taurolidine-citrate is a promising combination agent for the prevention and treatment of intravascular catheter-related infections...|$|R
40|$|Background/PurposeCommunity-acquired {{pneumonia}} (CAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) may {{be caused}} by potential <b>antimicrobial</b> drug-resistant (PADR) <b>microbes.</b> The aims of this study were to evaluate the incidences and risk factors associated with PADR microbes observed in patients with pneumonia occurring outside the hospital setting in Taiwan. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study of patients with CAP or HCAP admitted to six medical centers in the northern, central, and southern regions of Taiwan in 2007. The pathogens were evaluated by microbiological specimens within 72 hours after admission. The patients’ comorbidities, pathogens, and outcomes were evaluated. The risk factors of PADR microbes were identified by logistic regression analysis. ResultsThe enrolled patients exhibited HCAP (n= 713) and CAP (n= 933). The pathogens associated with HCAP (n= 383) and CAP (n= 441) included Pseudomonas spp. (29 %vs. 10 %, p< 0. 001), Klebsiella spp. (24 % vs. 25 %, p= 0. 250), Escherichia coli (6 % vs. 8 %, p= 0. 369), Haemophilus influnezae (3 % vs. 7 %, p= 0. 041), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2 % vs. 6 %, p= 0. 003) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (8 % vs. 4 %, p= 0. 008). The core pathogens of CAP and HCAP differed among the three regions of Taiwan. PADR microbes, including Pseudomonas spp. (n= 191), Acinetobacter spp. (n= 41), MRSA (n= 49) and cefotaxime- or ceftazidime-resistant Enterbacteriaceae (n= 25), were isolated from 13 % of patients with CAP and 23 % of patients with HCAP. Previous hospitalization, and neoplastic and neurological diseases were significant risk factors for acquiring PADR microbes. ConclusionPADR microbes were common in patients with HCAP and CAP in Taiwan. Broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting PADR microbes should be administered to patients who have undergone previous hospitalization and who exhibit neurological disorders and/or malignancies...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the synthesis and characterisation of TiO 2 based photocatalyst thin films and the assessment of their antimicrobial properties. When exposed to light of wavelength less than 380 nm TiO 2 films can demonstrate self-cleaning and self-disinfecting properties. This is due to photocatalytic processes occurring on the film surface resulting in film superhydrophilicity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These ROS and radicals readily oxidise organic pollutants and microbes adherent to the material surface. Consequently, TiO 2 thin films are of great research interest as self-cleaning, antimicrobial coatings. TiO 2 and doped TiO 2 materials were prepared by a simple sol-gel route from titanium n-butoxide as the principle precursor material. Film deposition was carried out using a dip-coating technique, with substrates withdrawn from the precursor sol at a fixed speed. Deposited films were calcined to produce crystalline thin films, with excellent adherence to the substrate (glass slides). Films were characterised using a number of analytical techniques including UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and EXAFS/XANES. Photocatalysis and film hydrophilicity were investigated using established methods. Stearic acid photodegradation, monitored by FT-IR was used to assess film photocatalysis, by monitoring the peak areas of the C-H stretching region. Relative film hydrophilicities were determined by measuring the contact angle of a sessile droplet of water. Antimicrobial properties of the films were assessed with typical examples of Gram- positive and Gram-negative organisms. Staphylococcus aureus (NCTC 6571) and Escherichia coli (NCTC 10418) were selected. Films demonstrated microbicidal activity against both organisms under 365 nm UV illumination, and under illumination by a typical hospital lamp (28 W 2 -D fluorescent). Microbial adhesion to various substrates was also examined, using a dip-blot method. Films produced in this study demonstrate excellent potential as durable surface coatings with significant <b>antimicrobial</b> activity against <b>microbes</b> of clinical importance. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Antimicrobial {{peptides}} {{are found}} in all kingdoms of life. During the evolution of multicellular organisms, antimicrobial peptides were established as key elements of innate immunity. Most antimicrobial peptides are thought to work by disrupting the integrity of cell membranes, causing pathogen death. As antimicrobial peptides target the membrane structure, pathogens can only acquire resistance by {{a fundamental change in}} membrane composition. Hence, the evolution of pathogen resistance has been a slow process. Therefore antimicrobial peptides are valuable alternatives to classical antibiotics against which multiple drug-resistant bacteria have emerged. For potential therapeutic applications as antibiotics a thorough knowledge of their mechanism of action is essential. Despite the increasingly comprehensive understanding of the biochemical properties of these peptides, the actual mechanism by which <b>antimicrobial</b> peptides lyse <b>microbes</b> is controversial. Results Here we investigate how Sushi 1, an antimicrobial peptide derived from the horseshoe crab (Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda), induces lysis of Gram-negative bacteria. To follow the entire process of antimicrobial action, we performed a variety of experiments including transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy as well as single molecule tracking of quantum dot-labeled antimicrobial peptides on live bacteria. Since in vitro measurements do not necessarily correlate with the in vivo action of a peptide we developed a novel fluorescent live bacteria lysis assay. Using fully functional nanoparticle-labeled Sushi 1, we observed the process of antimicrobial action at the single-molecule level. Conclusion Recently the hypothesis that many antimicrobial peptides act on internal targets to kill the bacterium has been discussed. Here, we demonstrate that the target sites of Sushi 1 are outer and inner membranes and are not cytosolic. Further, our findings suggest four successive steps of the bactericidal process: 1) Binding, mediated mainly by charged residues in the peptide; 2) Peptide association, as peptide concentration increases evidenced by a change in diffusive behavior; 3) Membrane disruption, during which lipopolysaccharide is not released; and 4) Lysis, by leakage of cytosolic content through large membrane defects. </p...|$|R

Целью исследования является выяснение роли и места гуморального иммунитета в патологии ХГП у лиц с паразитозами. Иммунологические исследования были проведены у 540 больных с хроническим генерализованным пародонтитом I- II ст. тяжести на фоне паразитарных инвазий (лямблиоз, энтеробиоз, токсокароз) – (основные группы). Группу сравнения составляли 90 больных ХГП I- II ст. тяжести без паразитарной инвазии. Контрольную группу составили 30 человек без патологии пародонта и хронической патологии других органов и систем, которые в период обследования считались практически здоровыми. О состоянии гуморального иммунитета больных ХГП судили по уровню содержания в сыворотке крови антител к этиологическим инфекционным агентам и общей антигенной детерминанте (ОАД) микробов, аффинности противомикробных IgG- антител, по содержанию IgА. IgМ, IgЕ, ЦИК, активности комплемента. Отмечено, что повышение уровня в крови IgЕ, ЦИК и комплемента является особенностью иммунных построек в организме больных ХГП с паразитозами, по сравнению с больными ХГП без паразитозов. При изучении качественных характеристик продуцируемых антимикробных антител установлено, что у больных ХГП I-II степени тяжести с паразитозами аффинность антител достоверно ниже, чем у больных ХГП без паразитозов. Малая антительная реакция иммунной системы на микробный фактор и низкая аффинность продуцируемых антимикробных антител, по-видимому, и объясняют неэффективность организма больного нейтрализовать и элиминировать микробы, заселяющие пародонтальные карманы, а также поддерживать нормальный биоценоз ротовой полости. Полученные данные также объясняют, почему у больных ХГП с паразитозами, степень микробной колонизации пародонтальных карманов и видовой состав микробов в ассоциациях выше, чем у больных без паразитозов.

The purpose of the investigation is to verify the role and place of {{humoral immunity}} in CGP pathology in patients with parasitosis. Materials and methods. Immunologic investigations were conducted among 540 patients with the chronic generalized periodontitis, severity level I-II, on the background of parasitic invasions (gisrdiasis, enterobiasis, toxocarosis) – (principle groups). The experimental group consisted of 90 CGP patients, severity level I-II, without parasitic invasions. The control group consisted of 30 people without the parodontium pathology and the chronic pathology of other organs and systems, who were considered practically healthy during the investigation. Humoral immunity condition in CGP patients was estimated by the content level of antibodies against etiological inflectional agents in the blood serum and the common antigenic determinant (CAD) of <b>microbes,</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> IgG- antibodies affinity, by the content of IgА. IgМ, IgЕ, CIC, complement activity. Results and conclusions. It is noted that increasing of IgE, CIC and complement levels in blood are the peculiarity of immune structures in the organism of CGP patients with parasitosis, compared with CGP patients without parasitosis. While investigating the qualitative characteristics of the produced antimicrobial antibodies, it was found that in CGP patients, I-II severity level, with parasitosis the antibodies affinity was significantly lower than in CGP patients without parasitosis. Weak antibody immune response to the microbial factor and low produced antimicrobial antibodies affinity, apparently, explain the impossibility for the patient to neutralize and eliminate the bacteria, populating the periodontal pockets, as well as to maintain normal mouth cavity biocenosis. The obtained data also explain, why in CGP patients with parasitosis the degree of microbial colonization of periodontal pockets and species composition of microbial associations is higher than in patients without parasitosis.
