500|$|Anna is a teen model {{who is a}} {{good friend}} of Maiko and goes to the same all-girl school as her; she is {{similarly}} well-known and experienced in modeling. She is considered outspoken and sharp-tongued by other models. Anna at first disapproves of Shuichi dressing as a girl, and even calls Shuichi a freak soon after meeting Shuichi. Anna initially tells Maho she has no interest in her [...] "weak" [...] sibling because of Shuichi's femininity, though later dates Shuichi for a time after Shuichi asks her out, until she breaks up with Shuichi. However, the two soon resume their relationship with each other. Furthermore, Anna's opinion of Shuichi presenting as female also changes, she saying that it actually suits Shuichi, and the two even go out together on a date with Shuichi dressed as a girl. She feels Shuichi is an interesting person, and once says Shuichi is like <b>a</b> <b>cute</b> <b>little</b> sister. Anna spends {{a lot of money on}} clothes, and enjoys modifying them.|$|E
500|$|Early scenes {{animated}} by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston show that Pinocchio's design was exactly {{like that of}} a real wooden puppet with a long pointed nose, a peaked cap and bare wooden hands. Walt Disney, however, was not pleased with the work that was being done on the film. He felt that no one could really sympathize with such a character and called for an immediate halt in production. Fred Moore redesigned the character slightly to make him more appealing but the design still retained a wooden feel. Young and upcoming animator Milt Kahl felt that Thomas, Johnston and Moore were [...] "rather obsessed with the idea of this boy being a wooden puppet" [...] and felt that they should [...] "forget that he was a puppet and get <b>a</b> <b>cute</b> <b>little</b> boy; you can always draw the wooden joints and make him a wooden puppet afterwards". Hamilton Luske suggested to Kahl that he should demonstrate his beliefs by animating a test sequence. Kahl showed Disney a test scene in which Pinocchio is underwater looking for his father. From this scene Kahl re-envisioned the character by making him look more like a real boy, with a child's Tyrolean hat and standard cartoon character four-fingered (or three and a thumb) hands with Mickey Mouse-type gloves on them. The only parts of Pinocchio that still looked more or less like a puppet were his arms, legs and his little button wooden nose. Disney embraced Kahl's scene and immediately urged the writers to evolve Pinocchio into a more innocent, naïve, somewhat coy personality that reflected Kahl's design.|$|E

2500|$|Late {{at night}} after the {{landlord}} left, Wanrow and Hooper became frightened, although they had the pistol with them. [...] They invited Wanrow's sister and brother-in-law to the house, who arrived with three of their children. [...] The four adults did not sleep {{in order to better}} guard against any possible aggression. [...] At about five o'clock in the morning, unbeknownst to the women in the house, Wanrow's brother-in-law went to Wesler's residence and accused him of pedophilia. [...] Wesler was intoxicated, and he and an associate were persuaded to return to the Hooper home to reconcile their differences. [...] As Wesler attempted to enter the residence, Hooper yelled at him to get out of there, causing some commotion. [...] Wanrow's three-year-old nephew awoke and began crying, prompting Wesler, who had by this time entered the home, to state, [...] "My, what <b>a</b> <b>cute</b> <b>little</b> boy". [...] Wesler made a move for the child, which upset his mother, Wanrow's sister. [...] An emotional situation developed during which Wanrow drew her pistol and shot and killed Wesler. [...] His associate was also hit, but he survived and fled. [...] Hooper called Crime Check (similar to 911), and the call was recorded. [...] During the conversation, the telephone was passed to Wanrow, who confessed to the killing and expressed a distrust of the police. [...] Although she was upset, Wanrow was not screaming. [...] The stereotype of a [...] "hysterical woman" [...] was used against her by the prosecution to persuade the jury that she was calm. [...] This recording was to play prominently in her conviction and in its subsequent overturn.|$|E
2500|$|The {{series has}} {{attracted}} mostly positive reviews, largely {{focused on the}} depiction of its two septuagenarian lead characters. Jane Shilling of The Daily Telegraph labelled the series [...] "a triumph against TV's ageism" [...] in {{an examination of the}} portrayal of elderly people in the media. Shilling singled out Jacobi and Reid's performances, stating that they provide a [...] "mixture of gravity and levity" [...] that [...] "brings a transcendent quality to their characters' resolute ordinariness". Lucy Harmer, an executive member of the charity Age UK, also praised the series for portraying two [...] "normal, healthy and sane" [...] older characters, citing the depiction of Internet use by the elderly as something ordinary. She compared the treatment of older characters in the series to Hilary Boyd's novel Thursdays in the Park and the film The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2012). The Huffington Posts Caroline Frost thought the series was reminiscent of the dialogue and sensibility of the playwright Alan Bennett. She wrote the story was poignant and praised a central theme underlining [...] "how many people make do with their day-to-day business and responsibilities, while still holding on to their private dreams", Andrew Anthony of The Guardian had his [...] "low expectations... squarely confounded", giving particular praise to the dialogue and the central performances. Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror felt that Last Tango in Halifax experienced a mid-series dip, though she praised what she felt was a triumphant finale. She also praised Wainwright's script and the lead quartet of Jacobi, Reid, Lancashire, and Walker for creating [...] "characters you can believe in even when they're behaving appallingly". The series was reviewed favourably by the American website AfterEllen, which reports on the depiction of gay and bisexual women in the media. Correspondent Jill Guccini stated that she [...] "started off watching this series thinking it was <b>a</b> <b>cute</b> <b>little</b> show about some oldies falling in love", {{but at the end of}} the series believed it was [...] "some of the finest television I've seen, anywhere, ever".|$|E

2500|$|Although {{suspicious}} {{to begin}} with, Dot accepted them both into her home, believing that Nick truly had changed this time. Asked whether Nick {{really was a}} reformed character, Altman remained ambiguous: [...] "Nick's back, he's got <b>a</b> <b>cute</b> <b>little</b> daughter. He's become a plumber, he's a changed man. ...Or is he?" [...] As the storyline progressed, Nick's true agenda was revealed when he blackmailed his mother into giving him money for custody of Dotty. A BBC source reportedly told The Sun, [...] " [...] horrified when Nick tells her Dotty is for sale. He shows no emotion and his evil grin sends shivers down her spine. She always knew Nick would sell his soul {{for the price of}} some pick ’n mix but she had no idea he’d sell his own daughter." [...] In a further plot twist, it was revealed to the audience in 2009, that Dotty (real name Kirsty) was colluding with her father all along. In the storyline, Dotty suggested killing Dot for her life assurance policy. Nick leaves following this, allowing Dotty to work on Dot and he returns three months later where they begin their plan to convince Dot and her friends that she is suffering with dementia; Nick's aim being to kill Dot and blame her death on her deteriorating mental state. During Nick's brief stay in the square, he overheard Billy Mitchell telling Dot how he let Jase Dyer die and Nick blackmailed Billy by demanding regular payments or he would tell Jase's son Jay what Billy did. When Billy's cousin, Phil, found out about this, he led Nick into the barrel store of The Queen Vic, where he beats him up and ties him to a chair. Phil gave Billy the opportunity to scare Nick off and end this, however, Billy let him go and told Jay the truth himself. The plot with his own daughter to kill his beloved mother climaxes on-screen in June 2009: Nick's plan goes awry after Dotty has a change of heart and ultimately rescues her grandmother from being poisoned, instead drugging Nick. This leads to a series of events whereby Nick, in a bid to escape once his plan has been exposed, holds various members of the community hostage in the café and an accidental fire is started after Heather Trott pushes Nick into the chip pan. The hostages manage to escape due to a fight between Nick and Ryan Malloy, {{who was one of the}} hostages. This results in an explosion at the café with Nick and Bradley Branning inside. The storyline marked Altman's departure from the show once again. His departing episode was scripted as a cliffhanger, as it was not revealed whether Nick had survived the explosion at the end of the episode. However, in the following episode, on 4 June 2009, Nick is shown to survive the explosion and Bradley is hospitalised with injuries to his eye. Nick departs after once again being disowned by Dot. Dotty is left in Dot's care despite Nick explaining to his mother that Dotty is evil.|$|E
