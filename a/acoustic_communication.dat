5|$|Wild orangutans (P. pygmaeus wurmbii) in Tuanan, Borneo, were {{reported}} to use tools in <b>acoustic</b> <b>communication.</b> They use leaves to amplify the kiss squeak sounds they produce.

5|$|Another form of <b>acoustic</b> <b>communication</b> is the headslap. This {{typically}} {{starts with}} an {{animal in the}} water elevating its snout and remaining stationary. After some time, the jaws are opened sharply then clamped shut with a biting motion that makes a loud slapping sound, and this is immediately followed by a loud splash, after which the head may be submerged and copious bubbles produced. Some species then roar, while others slap the water with their tails. Episodes of headslapping spread through the group. The purpose varies, {{but it seems to}} be associated with maintaining social relationships, and is also used in courtship. Dominant individuals may also display their body size while swimming at the water surface, and a subordinate will submit by holding its head at an acute angle with the jaws open before retreating underwater.|$|E
25|$|Neuroplasticity is {{involved}} in the development of sensory function. The brain is born immature and it adapts to sensory inputs after birth. In the auditory system, congenital hearing impairment, a rather frequent inborn condition affecting 1 of 1000 newborns, has been shown to affect auditory development, and implantation of a sensory prostheses activating the auditory system has prevented the deficits and induced functional maturation of the auditory system. Due to a sensitive period for plasticity, there is also a sensitive period for such intervention within the first 2–4 years of life. Consequently, in prelingually deaf children, early cochlear implantation, as a rule, allows the children to learn the mother language and acquire <b>acoustic</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|E

40|$|Wireless {{underwater}} sensor {{networks have}} many potential applications: disaster notification and recovery, waterway usage monitoring, and scientific applications. Truly underwater nodes have few communications options, of which acoustics is one option. Underwater <b>acoustics</b> <b>communication</b> networks have unique difficulties, notably that propagation speed {{is much lower}} than in radio sensor networks. The data throughput is also much lower with underwater acoustics at moderate distances (less than 1 km).

2500|$|Electric fish {{generate}} an electrostatic field {{shaped like a}} dipole, with field lines describing a curved arc from positive pole to negative. The electric field signals differ from other communicating modes of communication such as sound or optical, which use signals that propagate as waves. While sound waves for <b>acoustic</b> <b>communication</b> or light waves (electromagnetic waves) for visual communications all propagate, electric signals do not (it is different from electromagnetic waves). As an electric field, the signal magnitude decreases {{in accordance with the}} inverse square law, which makes the signal sending and formation an energy-costly process. [...] Electric fish match the impedance of their electric organ to the conductivity of water in order to achieve minimum energy lost, and the final result is electric signals traveling for at most a few meters.|$|E

The interaction is studied in a behavioral experiment, measuring the timbral adjustments performers employ. Several timbre descriptors serve as acoustic measures, quantifying global and formant-based spectral-envelope properties. Furthermore, musicians’ self-assessment of their performances is measured through behavioral ratings. The performances are investigated across four factors, i. e., room <b>acoustics,</b> <b>communication</b> directivity, musical voicing, and leading vs. accompanying roles.

40|$|Recently, {{multicarrier}} modulation in {{the form}} of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been actively investigated in underwater acoustic communications for its effective algorithms to handle the channel time-variability. In order to improve the performance of the underwater <b>acoustic</b> OFDM <b>communication</b> system, the irregular repeat accumulate (IRA) code as a channel coding scheme is proposed in this paper. We analyzed the effect of parameters of the IRA code on the performance of the system. Computer simulation has been implemented and the sea trial has been carried out in shallow water acoustic channels near Xiamen port. The simulation results show that the IRA coding scheme has improved the SNR (signal noise ratio) performance of the system at range of 14 dB to 16 dB compared with the system without coding and the BER performance of the IRA code will get improvement with the increase of the code length and the iteration of decoding to a certain degree, and then tends to stable. Field test experiment results obtained with the IRA code are provided, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed channel coding for underwater <b>acoustic</b> OFDM <b>communication</b> system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} an {{iterative}} approach for recovering information sent over a shallow underwater <b>acoustic</b> (UWA) <b>communication</b> channel. The procedure has three main tasks: estimation of channel model parameters (CMPs), channel equalization, and decoding. These tasks are performed cyclicly until the algorithm converges. Information bits are convolutionally encoded, punctured and permuted, mapped into {{quaternary phase-shift keying}} (QPSK) symbols, linearly modulated, and transmitted through a downward-refracting ocean waveguide. Training symbols are prepended to the transmitted sequence for initial estimation of CMPs. Our algorithm processes data from a single receive sensor. Data are received on a vertical array {{and the performance of}} the algorithm for each sensor in the array is examined. There is negligible Doppler spread in the received data. However, difference between transmitter and receiver clocks as well as slight motion of the receive array produce a nonnegligible compression of the received signals. Consequently, there is observable Doppler “shift. ” Nonuniform resampling of the data produces time series we model as the output of a linear time-invariant system. Resampling and CMP estimation are done iteratively, in conjunction with equalization and decoding. The algorithm successfully processes the data to yield few or no information bit errors.
