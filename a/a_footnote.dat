5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>footnote</b> to Chapter XIII, Poe {{refers to}} the Polly, a wreck which drifted for six months across the Atlantic Ocean in 1811-1812. Poe {{probably}} read this history in an 1836 book by R. Thomas, Remarkable Events and Remarkable Shipwrecks, from which he quotes verbatim.|$|E
5|$|Dugdale both {{transcribed}} the Boulogne {{agreement and}} made a reference to it, in <b>a</b> <b>footnote</b> in his 1675 Baronage of England. After this the document was absent from history writing for almost three centuries. Dugdale's footnote was mentioned by certain historians, {{but it was not}} until 1965 that the document itself was again used as a source, when Noël Denholm-Young quoted a few lines from it in his History and Heraldry: 12541310. In 1972, J. R. S. Phillips printed a complete transcription of the Boulogne agreement in his book Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke 13071324.|$|E

5|$|Noddack was proven {{right after}} all. Fermi had {{dismissed}} {{the possibility of}} fission {{on the basis of}} his calculations, but he had not taken into account the binding energy that would appear when a nuclide with an odd number of neutrons absorbed an extra neutron. For Fermi, the news came as a profound embarrassment, as the transuranic elements that he had partly been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering had not been transuranic elements at all, but fission products. He added <b>a</b> <b>footnote</b> to this effect to his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.|$|E
5|$|Bellingham was immortalized as {{a fictional}} {{character}} in Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, as {{the brother of}} Ann Hibbins, {{a woman who was}} executed (in real life in 1656, {{as well as in the}} book) for practicing witchcraft. There are apparently no contemporary references to Mrs. Hibbins as Bellingham's sister—Hawthorne's formation of this connection appears to be based on <b>a</b> <b>footnote</b> in James Savage's 1825 edition of John Winthrop's journals, and a genealogical tree of the Bellinghams published early in the 20th century does not mention her. However, Ann Hibbins' second husband, William Hibbins, was first married to Richard Bellingham's sister Hester but she died a year later and was buried in England. Bellingham also appears in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's The New England Tragedies, which fictionalizes events dealing with the Quakers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} his death, Parsons was well remembered among the Western esoteric community; his scientific recognition frequently amounted to <b>a</b> <b>footnote.</b> For instance, English Thelemite Kenneth Grant suggested that Parsons' Babalon Working marked {{the start of}} the appearance of flying saucers in the skies, leading to phenomena such as the Roswell UFO incident and Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting. Cameron postulated that the 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident was a spiritual reaction to Parsons' death. In 1954 she portrayed Babalon in American Thelemite Kenneth Anger's short film Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome, viewing this cinematic depiction of a Thelemic ritual as aiding the literal invocation of Babalon begun by Parsons' working, and later said that his Book of the AntiChrist prophecies were fulfilled through the manifestation of Babalon in her person.|$|E
5000|$|In Uncut, Graeme Thomson wrote, Lost On The River is {{an album}} of good, {{sometimes}} excellent songs with a unique creation story which, in the end, adds little of substance to the narrative of perhaps the most mythologised recordings in history. <b>As</b> <b>footnotes</b> go, however, it’s an entertaining, energised and often fascinating one.|$|R

5|$|In the {{footnotes}} to his 1873 compilation, Milne-Edwards correlated the subfossil {{species with}} parrots mentioned by Leguat. In 1875, A. Newton analysed Tafforet's then newly rediscovered account, and identified {{a description of}} the Rodrigues parrot therein. In <b>a</b> <b>footnote</b> in an 1891 edition of Leguat's memoir, the English writer Samuel Pasfield Oliver doubted that the parrots mentioned were the Rodrigues parrot, due to their smaller size, and suggested they may have been Newton's parakeet (Psittacula exsul). As Leguat mentioned both green and blue parrots in the same sentence, the English palaeontologist Julian Hume suggested in 2007 that these could either be interpreted as references to both the Rodrigues parrot and Newton's parakeet, or as two colour morphs of the latter.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} a {{commercial}} failure in Japan {{but has been}} successful in the United States. Critical consensus is that Zombiepowder. was a technically proficient manga, but one which lacked the originality necessary to bear intrinsic appeal to most readers, which accounted for its cancellation. Additionally, the series was heavily focused on battles even by the standards of action manga, though whether this was a positive or negative trait is a matter of contention. Due to these factors, combined with its abrupt and unsatisfactory ending, critics hold that Zombiepowder. is significant primarily as a chapter in the career of its author, and would otherwise be <b>a</b> <b>footnote</b> which found an audience only among fans of violent action.|$|E
5|$|On 23 April, a heavy storm {{swept the}} Eastern Atlantic, {{striking}} Warren's squadron and their prizes. Marengo was seriously damaged, losing all three masts and {{taking on a}} large quantity of water {{that had to be}} pumped overboard by the understrength crew working in shifts. Five men were drowned. Ramilles also suffered in the high winds, losing almost all her masts and rolling for some hours, completely out of control. It was only when the storm had abated that jury masts could be raised and the scattered ships could rejoin the squadron for its journey back to Britain, arriving at Spithead. Willaumez eventually returned to the North Atlantic in the early summer, passing through the Caribbean before being dispersed in a hurricane, his ships scattered across the Western Atlantic. Most eventually reached France, but the campaign had been another disaster for the French Navy, with {{less than half of the}} ships sent out returning to Brest. The loss of Marengo and Belle Poule formed <b>a</b> <b>footnote</b> to the campaign, but the defeat of Linois was widely celebrated in Britain, where both ships were commissioned into the Royal Navy under their French names. Linois was praised for his defence of his ship in the face of overwhelming British force, and historian William James, writing in 1827, considered that had Linois faced London alone he might have had the advantage. Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants from London and Amazon still living in 1847.|$|E
