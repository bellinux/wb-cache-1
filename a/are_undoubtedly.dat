25|$|Over 4000 {{species of}} fungi have been {{recorded}} from Slovakia. Of these, nearly 1500 are lichen-forming species. Some of these fungi <b>are</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> endemic, but not enough is known to say how many. Of the lichen-forming species, about 40% have been classified as threatened in some way. About 7% are apparently extinct, 9% endangered, 17% vulnerable, and 7% rare. The conservation status of non-lichen-forming fungi in Slovakia is not well documented, {{but there is a}} red list for its larger fungi.|$|E
25|$|The {{names of}} their kings, such as Ambiorix and Catuvolcus, <b>are</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> Celtic. Also the {{material}} culture of the region, has been found by archaeologists to be highly Celtised, clearly {{in contact with the}} Celts of central Gaul, though far less rich in terms of Mediterranean luxury goods. They were not so strongly linked to the east of the Rhine. This would at the very least seem to suggest that at least the upper echelons were Celtic or had adopted a Celtic language and culture.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} origins of Hercules <b>are</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> Greek his figure {{underwent}} an early assimilation into Italic local religions and might even preserve traces of an association to Indoiranian deity Trita Apya that in Greece have not survived. Among other roles that Juno and Hercules share there is {{the protection of the}} newborn. Jean Bayet, author of Les origines de l'Arcadisme romain, has argued that such a function must be a later development as it looks to have superseded that of the two original Latin gods Picumnus and Pilumnus.|$|E

25|$|Tarebia granifera is both {{parthenogenetic}} and ovoviviparous, although {{males have}} been reported. These are characteristics which <b>are</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> key to its success as an invader. For example no males {{have been found}} amongst hundreds dissected from KwaZulu-Natal, {{it is probable that}} a few are present. Males were found in most (6/7) populations examined in Puerto Rico but were generally uncommon at up to 22.7% of the population (mean 4.6%). Live sperm were present in the testes of these males but the genitalia were apparently non-functional. R. Tucker Abbott (1952) failed to find sperm in the gonads of male Tarebia granifera from Florida. Most Tarebia granifera are therefore clones of the female parent.|$|E
25|$|Another {{variety that}} has {{sometimes}} been recognized is that of Moesian (or Mysian) for the language of an intermediate area immediately {{to the south of}} Danube in Serbia, Bulgaria and Romanian Dobruja: this and the dialects north of the Danube have been grouped together as Daco-Moesian. The language of the indigenous population has left hardly any trace in the anthroponymy of Moesia, but the toponymy indicates that the Moesii on the south bank of the Danube, north of the Haemus Mountains, and the Triballi in the valley of the Morava, shared a number of characteristic linguistic features with the Dacii south of the Carpathians and the Getae in the Wallachian plain, which sets them apart from the Thracians though their languages <b>are</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> related.|$|E
25|$|Marcus Sikosek (now Ziko van Dijk) has {{challenged}} this figure of 1.6 million as exaggerated. He estimated {{that even if}} Esperanto speakers were evenly distributed, assuming one million Esperanto speakers worldwide would lead one to expect about 180 {{in the city of}} Cologne. Van Dijk finds only 30 fluent speakers in that city, and similarly smaller-than-expected figures in several other places thought to have a larger-than-average concentration of Esperanto speakers. He also notes that there are a total of about 20,000 members of the various Esperanto organizations (other estimates are higher). Though there <b>are</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> many Esperanto speakers who are not members of any Esperanto organization, he thinks it unlikely that there are fifty times more speakers than organization members.|$|E

25|$|Heraclitus {{was born}} to an aristocratic family in Ephesus, in the Persian Empire, {{in what is now}} called present-day Efes, Turkey. His father was named either Blosôn or Herakôn. Diogenes says that he abdicated the kingship (basileia) in favor of his brother and Strabo {{confirms}} that there was a ruling family in Ephesus descended from the Ionian founder, Androclus, which still kept the title and could sit in the chief seat at the games, as well as a few other privileges. How much power the king had is another question. Ephesus {{had been part of the}} Persian Empire since 547 and was ruled by a satrap, a more distant figure, as the Great King allowed the Ionians considerable autonomy. Diogenes says that Heraclitus used to play knucklebones with the youths in the temple of Artemis and when asked to start making laws he refused saying that the constitution (politeia) was ponêra, which can mean either that it was fundamentally wrong or that he considered it toilsome. Two extant letters between Heraclitus and Darius I, quoted by Diogenes, <b>are</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> later forgeries.|$|E
25|$|New Bearings in English Poetry was {{the first}} major volume of {{criticism}} Leavis was to publish, and it provides insight into his own critical positions. He has been frequently (but often erroneously) associated with the American school of New Critics, a group which advocated close reading and detailed textual analysis of poetry over, or even instead of, an interest in the mind and personality of the poet, sources, the history of ideas and political and social implications. Although there <b>are</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> similarities between Leavis's approach to criticism and that of the New Critics (most particularly in that both take the work of art itself as the primary focus of critical discussion), Leavis is ultimately distinguishable from them, since he never adopted (and was explicitly hostile to) a theory of the poem as a self-contained and self-sufficient aesthetic and formal artifact, isolated from the society, culture and tradition from which it emerged. New Bearings, devoted principally to Gerard Manley Hopkins, William Butler Yeats, T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, was an attempt to identify the essential new achievements in modern poetry. It also discussed at length and praised the work of Ronald Bottrall, whose importance was not to be confirmed by readers and critics.|$|E
