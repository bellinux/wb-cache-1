40|$|Measurements of aerosol light-absorption {{coefficients}} {{are useful}} for studies of radiative transfer and heating rates. Ogren appears to have published the first light- absorption coefficients in the stratosphere in 1981, followed by Clarke in 1983 and Pueschel in 1992. Because most stratospheric soot appears {{to be due to}} aircraft operations, application of an aircraft soot aerosol emission index to projected fuel consumption suggests a threefold increase of soot loading and light absorption by 2025. Together, those four data sets indicate an increase in mid-visible light extinction at a rate of 6 % per year. This trend is similar to the increase per year of sulfuric <b>acid</b> <b>aerosol</b> and of commercial fleet size. The proportionality between stepped-up aircraft operations above the tropopause and increases in stratospheric soot and sulfuric <b>acid</b> <b>aerosol</b> implicate aircraft as a source of stratospheric pollution. Because the strongly light-absorbing soot and the predominantly light-scattering sulfuric <b>acid</b> <b>aerosol</b> increase at similar rates, however, the mid-visible stratospheric aerosol single scatter albedo is expected to remain constant and not approach a critical value of 0. 98 at which stratospheric cooling could change to warming...|$|E
40|$|Results {{from the}} first chemistry-transport model study {{of the impact of}} the 1783 – 1784 Laki fissure {{eruption}} (Iceland: 64 °N, 17 °W) upon atmospheric composition are presented. The eruption released an estimated 61 Tg(S) as SO 2 into the troposphere and lower stratosphere. The model has a high resolution tropopause region, and detailed sulphur chemistry. The simulated SO 2 plume spreads over much of the Northern Hemisphere, polewards of ~ 40 °N. About 70 % of the SO 2 gas is directly deposited to the surface before it can be oxidised to sulphuric <b>acid</b> <b>aerosol.</b> The main SO 2 oxidants, OH and H 2 O 2, are depleted by up to 40 % zonally, and the lifetime of SO 2 consequently increases. Zonally averaged tropospheric SO 2 concentrations over the first three months of the eruption exceed 20 ppbv, and sulphuric <b>acid</b> <b>aerosol</b> reaches ~ 2 ppbv. These compare to modelled pre-industrial/present-day values of 0. 1 / 0. 5 ppbv SO 2 and 0. 1 / 1. 0 ppbv sulphate. A total sulphuric <b>acid</b> <b>aerosol</b> yield of 17 – 22 Tg(S) is produced. The mean aerosol lifetime is 6 – 10 days, and the peak aerosol loading of the atmosphere is 1. 4 – 1. 7 Tg(S) (equivalent to 5. 9 – 7. 1 Tg of hydrated sulphuric <b>acid</b> <b>aerosol).</b> These compare to modelled pre-industrial/present-day sulphate burdens of 0. 28 / 0. 81 Tg(S), and lifetimes of 6 / 5 days, respectively. Due to the relatively short atmospheric residence times of both SO 2 and sulphate, the aerosol loading approximately mirrors the temporal evolution of emissions associated with the eruption. The model produces a reason-able simulation of the acid deposition found in Greenland ice cores. These results appear to be relatively insensitive to the vertical profile of emissions assumed, although if more of the emissions reached higher levels (> 12 km), this would give longer lifetimes and larger aerosol yields. Introducing the emissions in episodes generates similar results to using monthly mean emissions, because the atmospheric lifetimes are similar to the repose periods between episodes. Most previous estimates of the global aerosol loading associated with Laki did not use atmospheric models; this study suggests that these earlier estimates have been generally too large in magnitude, and too long-lived. Environmental effects following the Laki eruption may have been dominated by the widespread deposition of SO 2 gas rather than sulphuric <b>acid</b> <b>aerosol...</b>|$|E

40|$|Black {{carbon soot}} {{from the upper}} {{troposphere}} and lower stratosphere has been systematically collected at latitudes from 90 deg N to 45 deg S. The measured latitudinal distribution of this soot at 10 to 11 km altitude is found to covary with commercial air traffic fuel use, suggesting that aircraft fuel combustion at altitude is the principal source. In addition, at latitudes where the commercial air traffic is high, measured black carbon soot values are high even at 20 km altitude, suggesting that aircraft-generated soot injected just above the tropopause may be transported to higher altitudes. During the volcanically influenced period in which these samples were collected, the number abundances, total mass, and calculated total surface area of black carbon soot are 2 - 3 orders of magnitude lower than similar measures of sulfuric <b>acid</b> <b>aerosol.</b> During volcanically quiescent periods, the calculated total surface area of black carbon soot aerosol is of the same order of magnitude {{as that of the}} background sulfuric <b>acid</b> <b>aerosol.</b> It appears from this comparison that black carbon soot is only capable of influencing lower stratosphere or upper troposphere chemistry during periods when the aerosol budget is not dominated by volcanic activity.

40|$|We report {{here the}} {{experimental}} investigation of several photochemical reactions {{that may occur}} in concentrated sulfuric acid droplets in the clouds of the planet Venus. It {{was found that the}} irradiation of 80 - 100 wt. % sulfuric <b>acid</b> <b>aerosol</b> with 193 nm light in the presence of carbon monoxide resulted in the formation of carbon dioxide and either the formation or destruction of sulfur dioxide. The measured quantum yield for carbon dioxide formation is 0. 011 ± 0. 010. Various instrumental techniques for determining the size and number density of aerosol droplets were utilised in an attempt to generate a stable, monodisperse sulphuric <b>acid</b> <b>aerosol.</b> Concentrated sulfuric acid solutions were irradiated with 178. 3 nm, 184. 9 nm, 193. 3 nm and 253. 7 nm light in order to investigate the UV photochemistry of the bulk liquid. No significant photochemistry was observed. The reactions occurring in sulfuric <b>acid</b> <b>aerosol</b> at 193 nm were attributed to multiphoton processes, permitted by the optical focussing effects observed in small droplets. Irradiation of solutions of Fe(II) in 98 wt. % sulfuric acid solution with 193 nm or 248 nm light results in the formation of Fe(III). Under the same conditions, the reduction of Fe(III) is also observed. The presence of sulfur dioxide increases the initial rate of the reaction, and dissolved oxygen is consumed in the initial stages.

40|$|The observation, that {{absorption}} of light by {{concentrated sulphuric acid}} at wavelengths near 193 nm apparently tends to zero as the acid is progressively purified, is supported by ab initio calculations of the energies of the three lowest excited states of monomeric H 2 SO 4. The electronic-structure calculations indicate that the lowest excited state is not accessible by single-photon absorption for light of wavelengths> 150 nm. This limit includes a generous allowance for error; the calculated energy of the transition corresponds to a wavelength < 120 nm. Previous observations of photoluminescence and photo-oxidation of CO in sulphuric <b>acid</b> <b>aerosols</b> are attributed to multiphoton processes, caused by internal focusing of the incident light by the aerosol droplets.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} epidemiology {{since the}} 1950 s {{has been able}} to demonstrate that increases in daily mortality in London, England, were associated with elevated concentrations of index air pollutants, i. e., British Smoke (BS) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2). In this work, we reanalyze that portion of the 1958 - 1972 winter mortality-pollution record for which daily direct <b>acid</b> <b>aerosol</b> measurements were made at a central site in London (St. Bartholomew's Medical College). The purposes of these exploratory analyses are to examine the dataset for indications of a relationship between <b>acid</b> <b>aerosol</b> pollution and human mortality and to compare any noted associations with those for other pollution variables. It is found that the log of <b>acid</b> <b>aerosol</b> concentrations is more strongly associated with raw total mortality in bivariate analyses than is BS or S 02, despite the fact that acid data are available from only one central site (versus seven disperse sites for BS and S 02). The logarithmic nature of the exposure side of the H 2 S 04 -mortality relationship implies a saturation model of pollution effects, possibly due to multiday pollution harvesting influences on a susceptible subpopulation. Moreover,' mortality-pollution cross-correlation analyses indicate that mortality effects usually follow pollution in time, supporting a causal relationship between the two. The apparent advantage of H 2 S 04 over BS in predicting total raw mortality is consistent with the hypothesis that it is the portion of particulate mass of greater health significance and may also allow the development of London mortality results which are more easily transferable to other environments than is the case for existing BS results...|$|E

The role of the two major defenses against acid aerosols, the conversion of acid to the ammonium salts by respiratory ammonia and buffering of acid by airway surface liquid are discussed in relation to airway acid burdens expected from typical inhalation exposures. The roles of particle size and hygroscopicity on airway deposition of aerosol are also included.

Crystallization occurred either when the composition was about 60 wt% H 2 SO 4 or after ice formed on the films at temperatures 1 - 4 K below the ice frost point. Finally, we determined that the melting point for SAT depended on the background water pressure and was 216 - 219 K in the presence of 4 x 10 (exp - 4) Torr H 2 O.

A growth factor of 1. 16 at 85 % relative humidity (RH) was found for the Aldrich humic acid which can be regarded as an upper limit for growth factors of humic-like substances (HULIS) found in atmospheric aerosol and is significantly smaller than that of typical atmospheric inorganics. We find that the humic <b>acid</b> <b>aerosols</b> exhibit water uptake over all relative humidities with no apparent phase changes, suggesting that these aerosols readily form supersaturated droplets. In the mixed particles, the humic acid component decreases the deliquescence relative humidity (DRH) and increases the efflorescence relative humidity (ERH) of the ammonium sulphate component, and there is some degree of water uptake prior to ammonium sulphate deliquescence. In addition, at low RH, the FTIR spectra show that the ammonium is present in a different chemical environment in the mixed aerosols than in crystalline ammonium sulphate, perhaps existing as a complex with the humic materials. The growth factors of the mixed aerosols are intermediate between those of the single-component aerosols and can be predicted assuming that the inorganic and organic fractions take up water independently...|$|R
