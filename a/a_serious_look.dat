25|$|As {{his career}} progressed, Tanaka's films became {{known for their}} imaginative, {{sometimes}} surreal, use of color and poetic imagery within the setting of a harsh, brutal world. In 1973, Tanaka directed the second entry in the Secret Chronicle trilogy, Secret Chronicle: Torture Hell. In contrast to the first entry in the trilogy, a satirical depiction of a 19th-century brothel, Tanaka's film was <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>look</b> at religious-sexual ceremonies at a temple. For this effort, Tanaka won the Directors Guild of Japan New Directors Citation in 1973. The last film of this trilogy, Secret Chronicle: She Beast Market (1974) returned to the satirical style of the first film. The cast included the popular poet Sakumi Hagiwara playing the memorable role {{of a man who}} simultaneously commits suicide and wipes out a gang of yakuza when he explodes a gas-filled inflatable sex-doll.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st century, Indian {{political}} circles started to take <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>look</b> at Bangladeshi illegal immigration into India. Bangladesh is under pressure from India as a source of rebellion in Indian North-East for this Indian perception. It is also hard pressed to convince India that encouraging migration is not a state policy of Bangladesh. The state of Bangladesh denied the existence of these immigrants while stripping them of their Bangladeshi citizenship. According to Jyoti M. Pathania of South Asia Analysis Group the reasons for Bangladeshi immigration to India are: basic need theory i.e. food, shelter and clothing, economic dictates i.e. employment opportunity, better wages and comparatively better living conditions, demographic disproportion especially for minorities (Hindus) in this densely populated country having roughly a density of 780 per km2 as against half that number on Indian side of the border, and being cheap labor the Bangladeshis find easy acceptance as “domestic helps” in Indian homes, which keeps proliferating by ever increasing demand for domestic helps. The Centre for Women and Children Studies estimated in 1998 that 27,000 Bangladeshis have been forced into prostitution in India.|$|E

500|$|Sarah Stegall {{proposed}} that the episode works on two separate layers. On the top-most superficial layer, it functions as an outright parody, mimicking both the stylings of The X-Files as well as Cops. However, on the other layer, she notes that [...] "it's <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>look</b> at validation." [...] Throughout the episode, Mulder is attempting to capture the monster on camera and expose it to a national audience. However, all of the witnesses to the monster function as unreliable narrators: a Hispanic woman with [...] "a history of medications", a homosexual [...] "Drama Queen", a prostitute, a [...] "terrified morgue attendant, and Deputy Wetzel. Stegall argues {{that all of these}} characters are from [...] "the wrong side of the tracks" [...] and would not be accepted, let alone believed, by [...] "a placid, middle-class society". In the end, the only reliable witness is the camera, but Stegall points out that [...] "the camera, suspiciously, never quite manages to find [...]" [...] Furthermore, she reasons that Mulder's biggest fear is not finding the monster. To back this idea up, she points out that Mulder not only fails to find what he is looking for, but he also fails before a live audience.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{prospects}} who {{may have}} never had <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>look</b> were given chances they thought they never would have. Undrafted journeyman Chris Minard had been signed with Alaska for his third season in the ECHL when the lockout allowed Davis Payne to assign him on the same line as Gomez at the Aces. Gomez saw a gem {{that led to the}} 2005 ECHL All-Star Game, and a top ECHL player that season; the pairing led to Gomez giving Minard a shot after the lockout ended, and he played his way into the AHL, and eventually signing a two-way contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins, receiving in 2007–08 his first call-up to the NHL. Minard said about the experience, [...] "That's when I learned a lot about being a goal-scorer, playing with a guy like that who can pass the puck. It was a pretty cool experience." ...|$|E
