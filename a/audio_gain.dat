40|$|The {{recording}} and reproduction of spatial <b>audio</b> <b>gains</b> increasing attention since multichannel sound {{systems have been}} established in modern audio applications. Directional Audio Coding (DirAC) represents an efficient description of spatial sound {{in terms of a}} few audio downmix signals and parametric side information in frequency sub-bands, namely the direction-of-arrival and diffuseness of the sound. Traditionally, the directional parameters are derived based on the active sound intensity vector, which can be efficiently estimated via two or threedimensional microphone grids. However, due to form factor constraints, linear microphone arrays are often more suitable in practice and thus, alternative parameter estimation techniques are required. In this contribution, a framework for parametric spatial audio processing based on linear microphone arrays is presented allowing for an efficient recording, enhancement, and reproduction of spatial sound. Different application examples are discussed including parametric directional filtering and de-reverberation...|$|R

It was the first electronic graphics generator used in television production. Brought to the marketplace at the NAB in 1970, it revolutionized television production.The minicam was developed for use in national political conventions in 1968.In 1971, a backwards-compatible 4-channel encoding technique was developed for vinyl records, called SQ Quadraphonic, based on work by musician Peter Scheiber and Labs engineer Benjamin B.

40|$|A {{discussion}} of the development and application of program-controlled circuits in broadcasting, {{with a description of}} a general-purpose AAGC amplifier in regular use. T HE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER is to cover briefly the history of Auto- matic <b>Audio</b> <b>Gain</b> Controls a t the National Broadcasting Company. With this equipment line levels may be held more constant, the average level in-creased many fold, and the listening pub-lic-both radio and television-subjected less to sudden drastic changes of sound volume. The new automatic control in-corporates a number of improved fea-tures as compared to those which are currently employed for adjusting gain as a function of program level, thereby eliminating undue volume fluctuations. Such control equipments are not only called Automatic <b>Audio</b> <b>Gain</b> Controls, or AAGC's but compressors, limiters, program regulators, {{and a number of other}} descriptive names, some compli-mentary and some uncomplimentary. Im-proper maintenance or operation, as well as unsuitable design, accounts for most of those in the latter category, but judg-ing from the fact that there are in the United States thousands of units giving satisfactory daily service, it is obvious that results are generally well worth while.

40|$|Applications {{that demand}} {{stringent}} conditions on output dc voltage ripple require models that can accurately predict {{the magnitude of}} ripple at the output voltage. The paper analyses the impact of dc input ripple on the output ripple for Series Resonant Converter (SRC) using discrete domain sampled data modelling method. The paper presents a novel discrete state space and small signal model for SRC. This small signal model is then simplified using practical assumptions. Analysis of the model indicates that a resonant peak can occur in the audio susceptibility transfer function for certain range of SRC circuit parameters. Small signal transfer function between input and output is analytically derived and validated with simulation by comparing <b>audio</b> susceptibility <b>gain</b> response plot and the resonant frequency. The paper also proposes a SRC parameter design region where the <b>audio</b> susceptibility <b>gain</b> of SRC to any input ripple frequency is less than unity.
