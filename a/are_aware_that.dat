5|$|Haunted by {{memories}} of the prostitute, Chandru lures two prostitutes to lonely places and murders them as he sees that woman in each of them. Rekha's female friend Pallavi comes to Bangalore to meet her, and telephones her for her residential address. The conversation is overheard by the Madam of a brothel, who misleads Pallavi. Instead of being taken to Rekha's house, Pallavi is taken to the brothel and forced into prostitution. Rekha and Raghunath search for Pallavi. Chandru comes to the same brothel and takes Pallavi in his car, but kills her. Rekha learns of Pallavi's murder through Raghunath; neither Rekha nor Raghunath <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Chandru is the murderer.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Africa, termites are consumed in local or tribal areas in Asia and North and South America. In Australia, Indigenous Australians <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> termites are edible {{but do not}} consume them even in times of scarcity; there are few explanations as to why. Termite mounds are the main sources of soil consumption (geophagy) in many countries including Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Researchers have suggested that termites are suitable candidates for human consumption and space agriculture, as they are high in protein {{and can be used}} to convert inedible waste to consumable products for humans.|$|E
5|$|Lexical {{variation}} between BASL {{and other}} dialects of ASL was first {{noted in the}} Dictionary of American Sign Language. In a later study of 34 lexical signs, Black signers {{were found to have}} 28 signs that White signers did not know. Older signers are more likely to use variant signs than younger signers. Most of these signs, having been developed in segregated schools for the Black Deaf, refer to everyday life. Younger signers of BASL are less likely to use these variants, but when asked about them <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> older signers have and use these innovative signs.|$|E

50|$|There are {{at least}} three types of awareness: agency awareness, goal awareness, and {{sensorimotor}} awareness, which may also be conscious or not. For example, in agency awareness you may <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> you performed a certain action yesterday, but are not now conscious of it. In goal awareness you may <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> you must search for a lost object, but are not now conscious of it. In sensorimotor awareness, you may <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> your hand <b>is</b> resting on an object, but are not now conscious of it.|$|R
5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor is blown off his feet by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to the second floor of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to his hotel suite that night, Bond finds Romanova {{waiting for him in}} his bed and has sex with her; neither <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> SPECTRE is filming them. The next day, Romanova heads off for a pre-arranged rendezvous at Hagia Sophia to drop off the floor plans for the consulate, with Grant ensuring Bond receives the plans by killing the other Bulgarian tail who attempts to intercept the drop. Using the plans, Bond and Kerim Bey successfully steal the Lektor and, together with Romanova, escape with the device onto the Orient Express. On the train, Kerim Bey quickly notices a Soviet security officer named Benz tailing them, prompting him and Bond to subdue him. When Bond leaves Benz and Kerim Bey alone together, Grant kills them and makes it appear as though they killed each other, preventing Bond from leaving the train with Romanova to rendezvous with one of Kerim's men.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, in {{an article}} in The New Republic, Alexander S. Heard stated that much of Sedaris' work is insufficiently factual to justify being marketed as nonfiction. Several {{published}} responses to Heard's article argued that Sedaris' readers <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> his descriptions and stories are intentionally exaggerated and manipulated to maximize comic effect, while others used the controversy as a springboard for discussing the liberties publishers are willing to take when calling books 'nonfiction'.|$|E
25|$|U.S. State Department {{officials}} <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Mexican president Felipe Calderón’s {{willingness to}} work with the United States is unprecedented on issues of security, crime and drugs, so the U.S. Congress passed legislation in late June 2008 to provide Mexico and Central American countries with $1.6 billion USD for the Mérida Initiative, a three-year international assistance plan. The Mérida Initiative provides Mexico and Central American countries with law enforcement training and equipment, as well as technical advice to strengthen the national justice systems. The Mérida Initiative does not include cash or weapons.|$|E
25|$|Anthropologists {{hypothesize that}} the Syrian public {{considers}} narghile smoke {{to be less}} dangerous than cigarette smoke due to the perceived “filtration” process that occurs as the tobacco passes through water before it gets inhaled. This hypothesis has become less popular following increasing prevalence of surveying and research, which show that Syrian narghile smokers <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> water is not a reliable means of filtration. The social atmosphere and positive connotation of smoking the narghile is likely to overshadow the health concerns and make it ultimately seem less harmful than smoking cigarettes.|$|E

25|$|Sexual {{objectification}} {{has been}} studied based on the proposition that girls and women develop their primary view of their physical selves from observing others. These observations can {{take place in the}} media or through personal experience. Through a blend of expected and actual exposure, women are socialized to objectify their own physical characteristics from a third person perception, which is identified as self-objectification. Women and girls develop an expected physical appearance for themselves, based on observations of others; and <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> others are likely to observe as well. The sexual objectification and self-objectification of women is believed to influence social gender roles and inequalities between the sexes.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} {{of individuals with}} micropsia <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> their perceptions do not mimic reality. Many can imagine the actual sizes of objects and distances between objects. It is common for patients suffering from micropsia {{to be able to}} indicate true size and distance despite their inability to perceive objects as they actually are. One specific patient was able to indicate the dimensions of specific objects with her hands. She was also able to estimate the distances between two objects and between an object and herself. She succeeded in indicating horizontal, vertical, and 45 degree positions and did not find it difficult to search for an object in a cluttered drawer, indicating that her figure-ground discrimination was intact despite suffering from micropsia.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people with}} OCD perform {{compulsive}} rituals because they inexplicably {{feel they have}} to, while others act compulsively so as to mitigate the anxiety that stems from particular obsessive thoughts. The person might feel that these actions somehow either will prevent a dreaded event from occurring or will push the event from their thoughts. In any case, the individual's reasoning is so idiosyncratic or distorted that it results in significant distress for the individual with OCD or for those around them. Excessive skin picking, hair-pulling, nail biting and other body-focused repetitive behavior disorders are all on the obsessive–compulsive spectrum. Some individuals with OCD <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> their behaviors are not rational, but feel compelled {{to follow through with}} them to fend off feelings of panic or dread.|$|E

25|$|On {{the day of}} Sachiko's {{birth and}} death, the curse on her weakens and she gets 24 hours to {{celebrate}} her birthday as someone closer to the girl she was before her death. She uses the timeloops as established in Corpse Party: Book of Shadows to force all survivors at that point to participate in activities she has set up. Given it's either that or die horribly again, something all <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> they've already experienced but can't remember in full, they go along with her demands. The game features almost all characters from the previous games and some new ones. While a pseudo-horror spin-off at best, {{it is part of}} the storyline, setting up a few details to prepare for Corpse Party: Blood Drive.|$|E
25|$|In a state torn {{by civil}} war, the contesting powers {{often do not}} have the ability to commit or the trust to believe in the other side’s {{commitment}} {{to put an end to}} war. When considering a peace agreement, the involved parties are aware of the high incentives to withdraw once one of them has taken an action that weakens their military, political or economical power. Commitment problems may deter a lasting peace agreement as the powers in question <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> neither of them is able to commit to their end of the bargain in the future. States are often unable to escape conflict traps (recurring civil war conflicts) due to the lack of strong political and legal institutions that motivate bargaining, settle disputes, and enforce peace settlements.|$|E
25|$|A prohibiting order (formerly {{known as}} a prohibition) {{prevents}} an unconstitutional act from being carried out by a public body. Hence, a key difference between a quashing order and a prohibiting order is that the former operates retrospectively while the latter operates prospectively. Where applicants <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> unconstitutionality can potentially arise, a prohibiting order can be sought to stop the public body from acting unconstitutionally. Such an order will also prevent the same decisions from occurring in the future. In Singapore, there {{has yet to be}} any reported case in which an applicant sought a prohibiting order in a constitutional matter. However, in the administrative law context, in Re Fong Thin Choo (1991) the High Court stated that the legal principles which apply to quashing orders are equally applicable to prohibiting orders.|$|E
