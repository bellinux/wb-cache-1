To obtain further insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-associated ALI, we compared SARS-CoV infections in two different nonhuman primate species, cynomolgus macaques and <b>African</b> <b>green</b> <b>monkeys.</b> Viral titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract were not significantly different in SARS-CoV-infected macaques and <b>African</b> <b>green</b> <b>monkeys.</b> Inflammatory cytokines that play a major role in mediating and amplifying ALI/ARDS or have neutrophil chemoattractant activity, such as IL- 6, IL- 8, CXCL 1, and CXCL 2, were, however, induced only in macaques.

40|$|The high {{seroprevalence}} of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) in <b>African</b> <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> (AGMs) without immunological {{defects in}} their natural hosts has prompted consideration of SIV-infected AGMs {{as a model of}} apathogenic SIV infection. Study of the molecular mechanisms of SIVagm asymptomatic infection could thus provide clues for understanding the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency viruses. Regulatory genes could be candidates for genetic control of SIVagm apathogenicity. We have characterized Vpr, Tat, Rev, and Nef genes of two SIVagm strains isolated from naturally infected sabaeus monkeys captured in Senegal. The results provide further evidence that SIVagm from West <b>African</b> <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> is the most divergent class of AGM viruses, with structural features in long terminal repeat sequences and Vpr and Tat genes that distinguish them from viruses isolated from other AGM species (vervet, grivet, and tantalus monkeys) ...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectiveThis study {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} a non-human primate, the olive baboon (Papio anubis), as a model of dengue infection. Olive baboons closely resemble humans genetically and physiologically and have been used extensively for assessing novel vaccine formulations. MethodsTwo doses of dengue virus type 2 (DENV- 2) were tested in baboons: 103 and 104 pfu. Similarly, <b>African</b> <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> received the same quantity of virus and acted as positive controls. ResultsFollowing exposure, high levels of viremia were detected in both animal species. There was a trend to detect more days of viremia and more homogeneous viral titers in animals receiving the low viral dose. In addition, baboons infected with the virus generally exhibited positive virus isolation 1 day later than <b>African</b> <b>green</b> <b>monkeys.</b> Humoral responses consisting of antiviral and neutralizing antibodies were detected in all animals after infection. ConclusionsWe conclude that baboons provide an alternative non-human primate species for experimental DENV- 2 infection and we recommend their use for further tests of vaccines, administering the lowest dose assayed: 103 pfu...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHuman {{parainfluenza virus}} type 1 (HPIV 1), {{a major cause}} of croup in infants and young children, {{accounts}} for 6 % of hospitalizations for pediatric respiratory tract disease. The antigenically related Sendai virus, referred to here as murine PIV 1 (MPIV 1), is being considered for use as a live-attenuated vaccine to protect against HPIV 1 (J. L. Hurwitz, K. F. Soike, M. Y., Sangster, A. Portner, R. E. Sealy, D. H. Dawson, and C. Coleclough, 1997, Vaccine 15 (5), 533 – 540) and also as a recombinant vaccine vector expressing antigens to protect against viral disease in humans. However, in the 1950 s MPIV 1 was reported to have been isolated from humans, suggesting that zoonotic transmission might have occurred. It is therefore important to examine the ability of MPIV 1 to replicate in nonhuman primates, i. e., surrogate hosts for humans. In the present study the level of replication of MPIV 1 and HPIV 1 was compared in <b>African</b> <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> and chimpanzees. Surprisingly, MPIV 1 replicated as efficiently as HPIV 1 in the upper and lower respiratory tract of <b>African</b> <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> at doses of 104 and 106 and replicated only slightly less efficiently at both sites in chimpanzees. <b>African</b> <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> immunized with MPIV 1 were highly resistant to subsequent challenge with HPIV 1 even though MPIV 1 did not induce a detectable HPIV 1 -neutralizing antibody response. The high level of replication of MPIV 1 observed in the upper and lower respiratory tract of these primates suggests that MPIV 1 likely would require significant attenuation before it could be given to humans as a vaccine against HPIV 1 or as a vaccine vector. Its ability to efficiently replicate in nonhuman primates suggests that MPIV 1 lacks a significant host range restriction in primates and could theoretically cause zoonotic disease in humans...|$|R
