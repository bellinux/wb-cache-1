Since <b>a</b> <b>phased</b> rollout of new products can be considered as an option on a worldwide launch, real option theory is applied to enhance decision making about entry strategy. We derive the analytical properties and illustrate the model with <b>a</b> case on <b>phasing</b> the rollout of CD-I at Philips Electronics. Under the assumptions made, we found that the value of <b>a</b> <b>phased</b> rollout strategy mainly depends on market and technology uncertainty and the expected net present value of the investment.

5|$|Fluorine has two solid forms, α- and β-fluorine. The latter {{crystallizes}} at −220°C (−364°F) and is {{transparent and}} soft, {{with the same}} disordered cubic structure of freshly crystallized solid oxygen, unlike the orthorhombic systems of other solid halogens. Further cooling to −228°C (−378°F) induces <b>a</b> <b>phase</b> transition into opaque and hard α-fluorine, which has a monoclinic structure with dense, angled layers of molecules. The transition from β- to α-fluorine is more exothermic than the condensation of fluorine, and can be violent.|$|E
40|$|Phase {{diagrams}} of two component mixtures are presented. One {{component is}} chosen from a homologous series of 4 -cyanobiphenyl 4 '-alkylbiphenyl- 4 -carboxylates (nCBB) {{in such a}} way that it possesses a nematic and smectic <b>A</b> 1 <b>phase</b> (i. e. n= 4, 5, 6, 7), and the second from a homologous series of 4 -alkyl- 4 '-cyanobiphenyls (nCB, n = 0 - 8). In nCBB-nCB system a strong enhancement of the smectic <b>Ad</b> <b>phase</b> is observed for the smectic member of nCB (n= 8) and the smectic <b>Ad</b> <b>phase</b> induction for the nematic members of nCB (n= 0 - 7). In most cases the temperature-composition area of the induced smectic <b>Ad</b> <b>phase</b> is <b>an</b> “island” surrounded by the nematic phase. The size and shape of the induced smectic <b>Ad</b> <b>phase</b> area depend on the alkyl chain length of both components. The smectic layer spacing is close to the dimer length of nCBB molecules, and slightly expands with increasing temperature and concentration of nCB. Exchange of a component with the unbranched alkyl chain with branched one favors induction of <b>Ad</b> <b>phase...</b>|$|R

This liquid would be characterized by a condensation of colored quark Cooper pairs, thereby breaking the local SU(3)c symmetry. Because quark Cooper pairs harbor color charge, such <b>a</b> <b>phase</b> of quark matter would be color superconductive; that is, color charge would be able to pass through it with no resistance.|$|E

40|$|Care pathways, {{also known}} as {{clinical}} pathways, are used worldwide to organize and follow-up patient focused care processes. Care pathways are nowadays defined as complex interventions. In the past years, more than 110 organizations in Belgium and The Netherlands performed more than 1200 pathway projects. These projects used the 30 step methodology of the Belgian Dutch Clinical Pathway Network, developed by the Center for Health Services and Nursing Research, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven between 1998 and 2002. 	Based on the experience in the Network between 2002 and 2009 and based on national and international research in close collaboration with the European Pathway Association, the methodology was revised. The 30 step methodology was changed into <b>a</b> seven <b>phase</b> model to develop, implement, evaluate and continuously follow-up care pathways and is usable for in-hospital, primary care and cross boundary projects. The seven <b>phases</b> consist of <b>a</b> screening <b>phase,</b> <b>a</b> project management <b>phase,</b> <b>a</b> diagnose <b>phase,</b> <b>a</b> development <b>phase,</b> <b>an</b> implementation <b>phase,</b> <b>an</b> evaluation <b>phase</b> and <b>a</b> continuous follow-up <b>phase.</b> 	Compliance to this methodology is no guarantee for success but could support the multidisciplinary teams who want to (re) organise safe, efficient, effective, patient centered, timely, equitable, continuous and integrated care processes. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The {{fundamental}} insight here is that, whilst parallel {{arrangements of}} anisotropic objects {{lead to a}} decrease in orientational entropy, there {{is an increase in}} positional entropy.

Although this model is conceptually helpful, its mathematical formulation makes several assumptions that limit its applicability to real systems.|$|E
