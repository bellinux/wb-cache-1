5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Grand Duchy of Moscow {{continued}} activities aimed at unifying the old Rus' lands still under Lithuanian rule. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania had insufficient resources to counter Moscow's advances, already having {{to control the}} Rus' population within its borders <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> count on loyalty of Rus' feudal lords. As {{a result of the}} protracted war {{at the turn of the}} 15th and 16th centuries, Moscow acquired large tracts of territory east of the Dnieper River. Polish assistance and involvement were increasingly becoming a necessary component of the balance of power in the eastern reaches of the Lithuanian domain.|$|E

5|$|Most {{commonly}} {{employed as}} a right-handed opening batsman, Sainsbury was one of Somerset's most talented batsman during their formative years. His slow underarm bowling was effective in second-class cricket, but {{in an era when}} overarm bowling was becoming the standard, he was used sparingly in the first-class game. During his time at Somerset, the county gained first-class status. After being led for three seasons by Sainsbury's Lansdown team-mate Stephen Newton, Sainsbury was given the Somerset captaincy for the 1885 season. A combination of poor results <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> raise a full eleven during that season led to the county's removal from the first-class game, although Sainsbury remained as captain until 1888. By the time Somerset had improved sufficiently to return to first-class cricket in 1891, Sainsbury had moved to neighbouring county Gloucestershire, where he saw out his county cricket career.|$|E

25|$|The 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix indeed did adopt a late {{afternoon}} start (17:00 local time, 09:00 UTC).

The race ended on lap 33, and with the regulations requiring 42 laps for full points, both driver and constructor results were halved in relation to points.|$|E

Taylor is also reported to have been a Freemason.|$|E
25|$|From 1000 to 1300 the {{population}} increased from 150,000 to 400,000, resulting both in more land being cleared and the subdivision of farms. While in the Viking Age all farmers owned their own land, by 1300 {{seventy percent of}} the land was owned by the king, the church, or the aristocracy. This was a gradual process which took place because of farmers borrowing money in poor times <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> repay. However, tenants always remained free men and the large distances and often scattered ownership meant that they enjoyed much more freedom than continental serfs. In the 13th century about twenty percent of a farmer's yield went to the king, church and landowners.|$|E

St-Pierre dominated the fight with his wrestling. He caught Hardy in the first round with an armbar, but Hardy refused to tap and eventually fought out of the hold. In the fourth round St-Pierre caught Hardy in a kimura while in the reverse-mount position, but St-Pierre was again unable to finish Hardy before he was able to escape. St-Pierre {{went on to win the}} fight by unanimous decision (50–43, 50–44, 50–45). After the fight, he stated that he was glad to win but was not impressed by his performance, stating that he wanted to finish the fight which fans agreed. St-Pierre received harsh criticism for stalling the fight against Hardy <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> finish him.|$|E
500|$|Beveridge {{generally}} {{praised the}} DVD's quality and extras were generally praised, summing {{it up as}} a [...] "top notch release". Alex Brotman of AnimeFringe.com, reviewing the Japanese DVD release, called the film great, but was disappointed in the lack of special features for the DVD, particularly citing the lack of interviews with cast and crew members, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> view the storyboards, {{in contrast to the}} DVD release of the original series.

500|$|The story Cipriano {{originally}} [...] {{wanted in}} The Inquirer was never published. Cipriano accused The Inquirer of censoring his report and giving into demands from the Archdiocese.

Rosenthal said Cipriano [...] "has a very strong personal point of view and an agenda...There were things we didn't publish that Ralph wrote that we didn't think were truthful. He could never prove them." [...] Cipriano sued Rosenthal and The Inquirer for libel and the case was later settled out of court. In an 2001 interview with the Editor & Publisher, Cardinal Bevilacqua credited Tierney with stopping the story and noted that The Philadelphia Inquirers stories about the Archdiocese have been more positive. In 1998 Tierney was named a Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul II.|$|E

500|$|The album {{ends with}} [...] "The Tourist", which Jonny Greenwood wrote as an unusually staid piece where {{something}} [...] "doesn't have to happen... every three seconds." [...] He said, [...] "'The Tourist' doesn't sound like Radiohead at all. It {{has become a}} song with space." [...] The lyrics, written by Yorke, were inspired by his experience of watching American tourists in France frantically trying to see as many tourist attractions as possible. He said it {{was chosen as the}} closing track because [...] "a lot of the album was about background noise and everything moving too fast <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> keep up. It was really obvious to have 'Tourist' as the last song. That song was written to me from me, saying, 'Idiot, slow down.' Because at that point, I needed to. So that was the only resolution there could be: to slow down." [...] The [...] "unexpectedly bluesy waltz" [...] draws to a close as the guitars drop out, leaving only drums and bass, and concludes with the sound of a small bell.|$|E

When developing Jōjirō Takajō, he originally had a different appearance and personality, but {{over the course of the}} development process, he eventually became similar to Takamatsu from Angel Beats!. Maeda decided fairly early on to make Yuu Otosaka a low-life cheater at the start of Charlotte because he had never created a character like that before. When trying to choose a title for Charlotte, Maeda's friend Taisei Nakagawa proposed a title which could be abbreviated as [...] "AA" [...] based on its similarity to Angel Beats! abbreviation of [...] "AB". However, Maeda did not like the title, and devised the title Charlotte as one that would surpass the original [...] "AA" [...] title. The title Charlotte came from the song [...] by the Japanese band Art-School.|$|E
500|$|Grant {{was at the}} Adler Theatre in Davenport, Iowa, on the {{afternoon}} of November 29, 1986, preparing for his performance in Conversation with Cary Grant when he was taken ill. Though his close friend Roderick Mann recalled that he had met up with Grant at the Hollywood Park Racetrack earlier that month and he had been in a jovial state and in good health, Grant had been feeling unwell as he arrived at the theatre. Basil Williams, who photographed him there, thought that though Grant still looked his usual suave self, he noticed that he seemed very tired and that he stumbled once in the auditorium. Williams recalls that Grant rehearsed for half an hour before [...] "something seemed wrong" [...] all of a sudden, and he disappeared backstage. Grant was taken back to the Blackhawk Hotel where he and his wife Barbara had checked in, and a doctor was called and discovered that Grant was having a massive stroke, with a blood pressure reading of 210 over 130. Grant refused to be taken to hospital. The doctor recalled that [...] "The stroke was getting worse. In only fifteen minutes he deteriorated rapidly. It was terrible watching him die <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> help. But he wouldn't let us". By 8:45p.m. Grant had slipped into a coma and was taken to St. Luke's Hospital. He spent 45 minutes in emergency before being transferred to intensive care, where he was pronounced dead at 11:22p.m. He was 82.|$|E
