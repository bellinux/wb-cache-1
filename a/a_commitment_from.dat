5|$|Although {{the schools}} {{do not share}} {{geographic}} proximity, which would induce frequent recruiting battles, {{there have been some}} high-profile recruits that were heavily targeted by both institutions. Chris Webber, Michigan's Mr. Basketball in 1991 and the National High School player of the year, chose Michigan over Duke and eventually became the #1 pick in the 1993 NBA Draft after playing two seasons for the Wolverines. Duke returned the favor by gaining <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>from</b> Michigan-raised Detroit Country Day alum Shane Battier, the 1997 Mr. Basketball of Michigan, who led Duke's 2001 National Championship team, while sweeping all of the National Player of the Year awards. Battier had been a fan of the Fab Five growing up. More recently, Michigan landed Mitch McGary, who had visited only Michigan, Duke and University of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, the American {{government}} was becoming increasingly concerned {{at the lack}} of <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>from</b> Canada to take nuclear weapons. The interceptors and Bomarc missiles with which Canada was being supplied as a NORAD member were either of no use or of greatly diminished utility without nuclear devices. Canadian and American military officers launched a quiet campaign to make this known to the press, and to advocate for Canadian agreement to acquire the warheads. Diefenbaker was also upset when Pearson was invited to the White House for a dinner for Nobel Prize winners in April, and met with the President privately for 40 minutes. When the Prime Minister met with retiring American Ambassador Livingston Merchant, he angrily disclosed the paper Kennedy had left behind, and hinted that he might make use of it in the upcoming election campaign. Merchant's report caused consternation in Washington, and the ambassador was sent back to see Diefenbaker again. This time, he found Diefenbaker calm, and the Prime Minister pledged not to use the memo, and to give Merchant advance word if he changed his mind. Canada appointed a new ambassador to Washington, Charles Ritchie, who on arrival received a cool reception from Kennedy and found that the squabble was affecting progress on a number of issues.|$|E

25|$|By 1521, Sigismund had {{defeated}} the grand master and {{allied with the}} Kazan and Crimean Tatar hordes against Moscow.

The Lithuanian troops led by Dashkovich participated in the attack and tried to take Ryazan.|$|E
25|$|In January 2004, Gates co-chaired a Council on Foreign Relations {{task force}} on U.S. {{relations}} towards Iran. Among the task force's primary recommendation was to directly engage Iran on a diplomatic level regarding Iranian nuclear technology. Key points included a negotiated position that would allow Iran to develop its nuclear program in exchange for <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>from</b> Iran to use the program only for peaceful means.|$|E
25|$|Texas {{originally}} {{also received}} <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>from</b> Southlake Carroll quarterback Riley Dodge, {{son of former}} Longhorns quarterback Todd Dodge, but Riley Dodge later chose to decommit and headed to North Texas to play under his father.

25|$|In May 2003, Craig put {{a hold on}} {{more than}} 200 Air Force {{promotions}} {{in an attempt to}} pressure the Air Force to station four new C-130 cargo planes in Idaho, saying he received <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>from</b> the Air Force almost seven years earlier that the planes would be delivered. Defense Department officials said the reason the C-130s had not been sent to Idaho was that no new aircraft were being manufactured for the type of transport mission done by the Idaho Air National Guard unit where Craig wanted the planes delivered.|$|E
25|$|In 1886, the UK flagged Inman Line became {{bankrupt}} and {{was taken}} over by its largest creditor, the Philadelphia-based International Navigation Company. The firm's Vice President, Clement Griscom immediately sailed to Liverpool with <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>from</b> the Pennsylvania Railroad to provide $2 million in capital towards the building of a new ship to compete against Cunard and White Star. Scottish shipbuilders were suffering a recession and proposed construction of two identical ships at the discounted price of $1,850,000 apiece.

25|$|Of the six {{first round}} quarterbacks drafted, two did not {{sign with the}} teams that {{selected}} them for the 1983 season. First overall pick Elway, who had made his antipathy towards the Colts known long before the draft, was also a promising baseball player in the New York Yankees organization. With Yankees owner George Steinbrenner aggressively pursuing <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>from</b> Elway to play baseball full-time, Elway and his agent, Marvin Demoff, successfully leveraged the threat of Elway abandoning football altogether to compel the Colts to trade Elway to the Broncos {{a few days after}} the draft.|$|E

25|$|On March 24, 2008, after {{considerable}} public discontent by Bear Stearns shareholders {{over the}} low acquisition price threatened the deal's closure, a revised offer was announced at approximately $10 per share. Under the revised terms, JPMorgan also immediately acquired a 39.5% stake in Bear Stearns (using newly issued shares) {{at the new}} offer price and gained <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>from</b> the board (representing another 10% of the share capital) that its members would {{vote in favor of}} the new deal.

This was the result of <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>from</b> the then Court Liberal Government that it would extend the Joondalup Line from Currambine to Clarkson during its term of government. The report was initiated following the completion of the South West Metropolitan Railway (SWMR) Master Plan, which was the basis of the Mandurah railway line and associated works.|$|E

25|$|Immediate further {{pressure}} {{to remove the}} Lords' veto now came from the Irish MPs, who wanted to remove the Lords' ability to block the introduction of Irish Home Rule. They threatened {{to vote against the}} Budget unless they had their way. With another general election likely before long, Asquith had to make clear the Liberal policy on constitutional change to the country without alienating the Irish and Labour. This initially proved difficult, and the King's speech opening Parliament was vague on what was to be done to neutralise the Lords' veto. Asquith dispirited his supporters by stating in Parliament that he had neither asked for nor received <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>from</b> King Edward to create peers. The cabinet considered resigning and leaving it up to Balfour to try to form a Conservative government.|$|E
25|$|The peace {{movement}} {{began to grow}} in influence by the mid-nineteenth century. The London Peace Society, under the initiative of American consul to Birmingham Elihu Burritt and the reverend Henry Richard, convened the first International Peace Congress in London in 1843. The congress decided on two aims: the ideal of peaceable arbitration {{in the affairs of}} nations and the creation of an international institution to achieve that. Richard became the secretary of the Peace Society in 1850 on a full-time basis, a position which he would keep for the next 40 years, earning himself a reputation as the 'Apostle of Peace'. He helped secure one of the earliest victories for the {{peace movement}} by securing <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>from</b> the Great Powers in the Treaty of Paris (1856) {{at the end of the}} Crimean War, in favour of arbitration. On the European continent, wracked by social upheaval, the first peace congress was held in Brussels in 1848 followed by Paris a year later.|$|E

500|$|The Slavery Commission {{sought to}} {{eradicate}} slavery and slave trading across the world, and fought forced prostitution. Its main success was through pressing the governments who administered mandated countries to end slavery in those countries. The League secured <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>from</b> Ethiopia to end slavery {{as a condition}} of membership in 1923, and worked with Liberia to abolish forced labour and intertribal slavery. The United Kingdom had not supported Ethiopian membership of the League on the grounds that [...] "Ethiopia had not reached a state of civilisation and internal security sufficient to warrant her admission." ...|$|E
500|$|Based on {{his junior}} college {{performance}} and increased bulk, Mitchell was recruited by several major college programs, but he originally committed to John McKay at the University of Southern California. While {{on the golf}} course with University of Alabama coach Paul [...] "Bear" [...] Bryant, McKay casually mentioned that he had received <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>from</b> an Alabama native. McKay assumed that Bryant wouldn't be interested in Mitchell because he was black and Alabama had no black players on their roster. Bryant swooped in and recruited Mitchell aggressively. Although Mitchell originally was a bit nervous about the reception he would receive at Alabama, as well as the amount of playing time he could garner, his family encouraged him to return home and accept Bryant's scholarship offer. Besides his family's encouragement and Bryant's assurances that his race would not be a problem, Mitchell's opinion that Alabama's School of Social Work was one of the country's best was a big factor in his decision.|$|E
