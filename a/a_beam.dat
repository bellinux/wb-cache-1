In an electron microscope, <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> of focused electrons {{interacts with the}} sample rather than <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> of light as in traditional microscopy. In conjunction with rapid freezing techniques, electron microscopy has also been used to study the mechanisms of inter- and intracellular transport, for instance in demonstrating that exocytotic vesicles are the means of chemical release at synapses.|$|E

5|$|As a Predator ship reaches Earth's orbit, it fires <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> {{that creates}} a passage through the ice towards {{the source of the}} heat bloom. When the team arrives at the {{abandoned}} whaling station above the heat source, they find the passage and descend beneath the ice.

40|$|The on-axis {{scintillation}} index for a circular dark hollow beam (DHB) propagating {{in a weak}} turbulent atmosphere is formulated, and the scintillation properties of a DHB are investigated in detail. The {{scintillation index}} for a DHB reduces to the scintillation index for <b>a</b> Gaussian <b>beam,</b> <b>an</b> annular <b>beam</b> and <b>a</b> flat-topped <b>beam</b> under certain conditions. It is found that the scintillation index of a DHB {{is closely related to}} the beam parameters and can be lower than that of <b>a</b> Gaussian <b>beam,</b> <b>an</b> annular <b>beam</b> and <b>a</b> flat-topped <b>beam</b> in <b>a</b> weak turbulent atmosphere at smaller waist sizes and longer propagation lengths...|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> grade <b>beam</b> {{differs from}} <b>a</b> wall footing because <b>a</b> grade <b>beam</b> is {{designed}} for bending and typically spans between pile caps or caissons, while a wall footing bears on soil and transmits {{the weight of the}} wall directly into the ground. It also differs from <b>a</b> strap <b>beam</b> because <b>a</b> grade <b>beam</b> is reinforced to distribute the weight of a wall to separate foundations, while <b>a</b> strap <b>beam</b> is designed to redistribute the weight of a column between footings.|$|R

There were also reports of flooded businesses and damaged crops. In the country, strong winds on the storm's fringe {{killed a man}} by striking him with <b>a</b> <b>beam.</b> Although there were initial reports of nine people missing, only two were counted in the death toll for mainland Colombia.

5|$|In 1962, a {{group of}} {{researchers}} at Bell Laboratories discovered laser action in xenon, and later found that the laser gain was improved by adding helium to the lasing medium.

5|$|Low-energy {{electron}} diffraction (LEED) is {{a method}} of bombarding a crystalline material with a collimated beam of electrons and then observing the resulting diffraction patterns to determine {{the structure of the}} material. The required energy of the electrons is typically in the range 20–200eV. The reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique uses the reflection of <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> of electrons fired at various low angles to characterize the surface of crystalline materials. The beam energy is typically in the range 8–20keV and the angle of incidence is 1–4°.|$|E

5|$|The Iron Duke-class {{ships were}} 622feet 9inches (189.9metres) long overall, and had <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> of 90ft (27.4m) and a draught of 29ft (8.8m). This was an {{increase}} of 25ft (7.7m) in length and 1ft (.3m) in width over the preceding King George V-class ships. The Iron Dukes displaced 25,000long tons (25,400tonnes). This was some 2,000tons (2,032tonnes) heavier than the preceding King George Vs, and was primarily due {{to the increase in}} calibre of the secondary battery.|$|E
5|$|The Stern–Gerlach {{experiment}} of 1922 provided {{further evidence}} of the quantum nature of the atom. When <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split based on the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or spin. As this direction is random, the beam could be expected to spread into a line. Instead, the beam was split into two parts, depending on whether the atomic spin was oriented up or down.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> light <b>beam</b> or beam {{of light}} is a {{directional}} projection of light energy radiating from a light source.

5|$|The {{first report}} of {{discovery}} of element 105 {{came from the}} Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, in 1968. A target of 243Am was bombarded by <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> of 22Ne ions. The scientists at Dubna reported 9.4MeV (with the reported half-life of 0.1–3 seconds) and 9.7MeV (t1/2>0.05s) alpha activities followed by alpha activities {{similar to those of}} either 256103 or 257103. The two activity lines were, based on prior theoretical predictions, assigned to 261105 and 260105, accordingly.|$|E
5|$|The {{single storey}} 1855 {{refractory}} block {{is on the}} same axis as the main cell block to its east. It consists of twelve punishment cells and six dark cells with no light. The gallows chamber, built in 1888, is between this and the main cell block and relates to the colonial use of the prison. The gallows operated via a rope tied around <b>a</b> <b>beam,</b> over a trap door, on the upper level. Opening the trap door would cause the condemned prisoner fall, and thus be hanged.|$|E

5000|$|... (also {{known as}} {{multispot}} beam generator or array <b>beam</b> generator) is <b>a</b> single optical element that divides <b>an</b> input <b>beam</b> into N output beams.

5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} is {{a technique}} used for determining the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline atoms cause <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> of incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions. By measuring the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams, a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal. From this electron density, the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined, {{as well as their}} chemical bonds, their disorder, and various other information.|$|E
5|$|After Gasketball 2012 release, Boxleiter and Wohlwend {{planned a}} celebratory road {{trip to a}} game jam in Victoria, British Columbia. The game did not fare as expected, so Boxleiter used the two-day jam to create the core mirror {{reflection}} mechanics of what would become TouchTone, though it would take two years of sporadic work to finalize {{the remainder of the}} game. In TouchTone, the player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats. The story is told through a series of reflection puzzles wherein the player swipes the screen to reflect <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> around a room to its intended destination.|$|E

He had tied a sheet around <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> and hanged himself. The Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that Tom's death {{must have been an}} experiment that had gone wrong. The incident made the teenage Hepburn nervous, moody, and suspicious of people. She shied away from other children, dropped out of Oxford School, and began receiving private tutoring. For many years she used Tom's birthday (November 8) as her own. It was not until her 1991 autobiography, Me: Stories of My Life, that Hepburn revealed her true birth date.|$|E
