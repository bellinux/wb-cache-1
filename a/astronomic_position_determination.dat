The AAPS {{was developed to}} automate and expedite the <b>determination</b> of <b>astronomic</b> <b>positions</b> (latitude and longitude). This equipment is capable of defining <b>astronomic</b> <b>positions</b> to an accuracy sigma = 0. 3 in each component within a two hour span of stellar observations which are acquired automatically. The basic concept acquires observations by timing stellar images as they cross a series of slits, comparing these observations to a stored star catalogue, and automatically deducing position and accuracy by least squares using pre-set convergence criteria. An exhaustive DMA operational test program has been initiated to evaluate {{the capabilities of the}} AAPS in a variety of environments (both climatic and positional).

40|$|This {{research}} analyzes {{and demonstrates}} the local <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> problem on Earth using a novel instrument, the Compass Star Tracker. Special focus {{is given to}} the theoretical development of the mathematics of local <b>position</b> <b>determination,</b> the design and fabrication of a proof-of-concept instrument, an error source analysis, and the experimental tests used to validate the <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> concepts. Star sensors are typically used as attitude determination instruments on spacecraft orbiting Earth. In this capacity, the star sensor determines the orientation of the spacecraft using digital images of the stars. This research utilizes the basic functionality of the star sensor in a new way; the orientation information from the star image is used to determine a user's latitude and longitude coordinates on Earth. This concept is valuable because it allows users to determine their position autonomously. The fundamental concepts that enable local <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> were originally published in Drs. Samaan, Mortari, and Junkins (AAS 04 - 007). This research improves upon that work by eliminating the zenith-orientation constraint and providing several crucial theoretical corrections. In addition to the <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> mathematics, this research provides analysis of the theoretical and practical error sources associated with the <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> problem. This research also details the design, fabrication, and experimental test program of a proof-of-concept Compass Star Tracker. Together, the theoretical development, error analysis, instrument design, and test program serve as validation of the the <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> concept. This work is intended as the first of many steps toward eventual deployment of autonomous <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> sensors on the Moon and Mars...|$|R

50|$|The {{meridian}} through Greenwich (inside Greenwich Park), England, {{called the}} Prime Meridian, {{was set at}} zero degrees of longitude, while other meridians were defined by the angle {{at the center of}} the earth between where it and the prime meridian cross the equator. As there are 360 degrees in a circle, the meridian on the opposite side of the earth from Greenwich, the antimeridian, forms the other half of a circle with the one through Greenwich, and is at 180° longitude near the International Date Line (with land mass and island deviations for boundary reasons). The meridians from West of Greenwich (0°) to the antimeridian (180°) define the Western Hemisphere and the meridians from East of Greenwich (0°) to the antimeridian (180°) define the Eastern Hemisphere. Most maps show the lines of longitude. The position of the prime meridian has changed a few times throughout history, mainly due to the transit observatory being built next door to the previous one (to maintain the service to shipping). Such changes had no significant practical effect. Historically, the average error in the determination of longitude was much larger than the change in position. The adoption of WGS84 ("World Geodetic System 84") as the positioning system has moved the geodetic prime meridian 102.478 metres east of its last <b>astronomic</b> <b>position</b> (measured at Greenwich). The position of the current geodetic prime meridian is not identified at all by any kind of sign or marking (as the older <b>astronomic</b> <b>position</b> was) in Greenwich, but can be located using a GPS receiver.|$|R

Survey-accurate <b>astronomic</b> <b>positions</b> were difficult to observe and calculate and so tended to be a base off which many other measurements were made.

40|$|The common {{methods for}} <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> of radio signal {{emitters}} (communications, radar) {{are based on}} meas-uring a specified parameter of the signal such as Angle-of-Arrival (AOA) or Time-of-Arrival (TOA). The measured parameters are then used to estimate the transmitter’s loca-tion. Since the measurements are done at each station inde-pendently, ignoring the constraint that the AOA/TOA esti-mates at different stations correspond to the same location, it is a sub-optimal <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> method. We propose a technique that uses exactly the same data as the common AOA methods but the <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> is direct and can handle more co-channel signals than the common methods.

40|$|Robot {{systems in}} {{critical}} applications, {{such as those}} in space and nuclear environments, must be able to operate during component failure to complete important tasks. One failure mode that has received little attention is the failure of joint position sensors. Current fault tolerant designs require the addition of directly redundant position sensors which can affect joint design. A new method is proposed that utilizes analytical redundancy to allow for continued operation during joint position sensor failure. Joint torque sensors are used with a virtual passive torque controller to make the robot joint stable without position feedback and improve position tracking performance in the presence of unknown link dynamics and end-effector loading. Two Cartesian accelerometer based methods are proposed to determine the position of the joint. The joint specific <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> method utilizes two triaxial accelerometers attached to the link driven by the joint with the failed position sensor. The joint specific method is not computationally complex and the position error is bounded. The system wide <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> method utilizes accelerometers distributed on different robot links and the end-effector to determine the position of sets of multiple joints. The system wide method requires fewer accelerometers than the joint specific method to make all joint position sensors fault tolerant but is more computationally complex and has lower convergence properties. Experiments were conducted on a laboratory manipulator. Both <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> methods were shown to track the actual position satisfactorily. A controller using the <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> methods and the virtual passive torque controller was able to servo the joints to a desired position during position sensor failure...|$|R

30|$|Navigation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} subjects in space missions divided into <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> and attitude determination. Determining the location and angular coordinates of spacecraft according to a fixed coordinate system is called <b>position</b> <b>determination</b> and attitude determination, respectively [1, 2]. In most cases, the inertial navigation system is used for spacecraft navigation. Inertial navigation system may have some errors in the long term due to natural factors such as gravity and magnetic effects or for reasons such as gyro axis deviation and accelerometers error. These effects are numerically low, but they would be effective with a high repetition in the long term. Therefore, this cumulative error sometimes must be corrected by an auxiliary navigation system [3].|$|R
