25|$|Now {{and then}} I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, {{are the most}} respectable critics of my {{position}} on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn {{is by far the}} first that comes to mind. His book, Race, IQ and Jensen (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually in <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>by</b> itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this did}} not affect RKO's plans for Astaire, first lending {{him for a few}} days to MGM in 1933 for his {{significant}} Hollywood debut, where he appeared as himself dancing with Joan Crawford in the successful musical film Dancing Lady. On his return to RKO, he got fifth billing after fourth billed Ginger Rogers in the 1933 Dolores del Río vehicle Flying Down to Rio. In a review, Variety magazine attributed its massive success to Astaire's presence:The main point of Flying Down to Rio is the screen promise of Fred Astaire... He's assuredly a bet after this one, for he's distinctly likable on the screen, the mike is kind to his voice and as a dancer he remains in <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>by</b> himself. The latter observation will be no news to the profession, which has long admitted that Astaire starts dancing where the others stop hoofing.|$|E

[...] He propels his massive frame at a rate of speed that terrifies opponents.... The acknowledged prowess of Schulz makes him an especial object of unfair attack in scrimmages by opponents who hope, by disabling him, to weaken the Michigan team".|$|E

[...] Time gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "In craftsmanship and delicacy of drawing and coloring, in the articulation of its dozens of characters, in the greater variety and depth of its photographic effects, it tops the high standard Snow White set. The charm, humor and loving care with which it treats its inanimate characters puts it in <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>by</b> itself."
