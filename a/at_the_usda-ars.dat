Results indicated that grass (ETos) and alfalfa (ETrs) reference crop ET were most sensitive to measurement errors in wind speed and air temperature followed by incoming shortwave (solar) radiation, and that data sensitivity was greater during the mid-summer growing season in this semi-arid region. Given the highly advective conditions of the Texas High Plains and the relative sensitivity of ET calculations to errors in wind speed, special care is recommended in siting, sensor placement, and sensor maintenance for agriculturally-based ET weather stations...|$|E

The averaging period for acoustical noise data was one second instead of one minute (smallest time increment recommended in IEC wind turbine noise standard) since the sound pressure level of small stand-alone wind turbines can vary significantly over just a few seconds.

The elevation at the HPGRS averages 1, 930 m with a mean annual precipitation of 380 mm and an average of 127 frost-free days. The average summer temperature is 18 °C and the average winter temperature is - 2.5 °C. The major cool-season (C 3) grasses on the site are western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii (Rydb) A. Love) and needle-and-thread grass (Hesperostipa comata (Trin. & Rupr.) Barkworth ssp. comata). The dominant warm-season (C 4) grass is blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K.)). The soils are mixed, mesic, Aridic Argiustolls, with the soil series being an Ascalon sandy loam (Schuman et al. 1999).

There also appeared to be certain holistic differences resulting from the combinations of certain treatments.
