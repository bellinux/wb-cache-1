5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>publicity</b> stunt for {{the opening}} of The Simpsons Movie on 16 July 2007, a giant Homer Simpson brandishing a {{doughnut}} was outlined in water-based biodegradable paint {{to the left of the}} Cerne Abbas giant. This act displeased local neopagans, who pledged to perform rain magic to wash the figure away.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to At Close Range, Foley also directed the song's video. David Naylor and Sharon Oreck {{were in charge}} of the production. The video serves as <b>a</b> <b>publicity</b> campaign for the movie, as it includes brief scenes of the film that indicate the conflict the young man in the movie—played by Sean Penn—feels.|$|E
5|$|My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boys {{original}} {{print of}} 25,000 copies were sold on pre-order in the United Kingdom, with 38,000 copies being sold.

5|$|On 25 January 2012, it was {{reported}} that an incident occurred when testing The Swarm. Limbs of test dummies were broken off when the ride passed an object that was located too close to the track. The Daily Mail suggested that the incident might have been <b>a</b> <b>publicity</b> stunt.|$|E

5|$|About a {{month before}} the race took place, in February 2015, the race organisers {{published}} <b>a</b> <b>publicity</b> poster for the race. This poster showed a woman, with her dress raised and underwear with the race logo visible. A cyclist's gloved hand was reaching out apparently to pinch the woman's bottom. The poster bore the caption Wie knijpt ze in Harelbeke? ("Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?"). This was a reference to Peter Sagan's actions after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, when he pinched the bottom of Maja Leye during the podium ceremony after the race.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{was forced}} to take <b>a</b> <b>publicity</b> {{position}} with the Liberty Loan program, and he continued to freelance until Collier's contacted him with an associate editor position. Benchley took this offer to Vanity Fair {{to see if they}} would match it, as he felt Vanity Fair was the better magazine, and Vanity Fair offered him the position of managing editor. He accepted and began work there in 1919.|$|E
5|$|By late 2004, Brokaw {{had retired}} from his {{anchoring}} duties at NBC, ceding the reins to Brian Williams; Rather planned {{to step down}} in March 2005. Jennings and ABC saw an opportunity to gain viewers, and initiated <b>a</b> <b>publicity</b> blitz touting the anchor's foreign reporting experience. However, despite having almost always reported {{from the scene of}} any major news story, Jennings was sidelined by an upper respiratory infection in late December 2004; he was forced to anchor from New York during the aftermath of the Asian tsunami, while his competitors traveled to the region. For Jennings, the situation was agonizing.|$|E

5|$|Fraser {{was engaged}} to design the coin on the {{recommendation}} of the United States Commission of Fine Arts. The coins were flown from the San Francisco Mint, where they were struck, to Washington state by airplane as <b>a</b> <b>publicity</b> stunt. They sold badly; much of the issue was returned for redemption and melting, and the failure may have been a factor in one official's suicide. Due to the low number of surviving pieces, the coins are valuable today.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Chopra had {{two leading}} roles. Her first film was Nikhil Advani's , {{a romantic comedy}} in six {{chapters}} with an ensemble cast. She was featured opposite Salman Khan in the first chapter as Kamini, an item girl and aspiring actress who tries to land the lead role in a Karan Johar film with <b>a</b> <b>publicity</b> gimmick. Film critic Sukanya Verma praised her flair for comedy, especially her impressions of Meena Kumari, Nargis and Madhubala. Both Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love and her next film, Big Brother, proved unsuccessful at the domestic box-office.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Blatty worked {{as the public}} {{relations}} director at Loyola University of Los Angeles and as <b>a</b> <b>publicity</b> director at the University of Southern California. He published his first book, Which Way to Mecca, Jack? in 1960, a humorous look at both his early life, and {{his work at the}} United States Information Agency in Lebanon. In 1961, while still working in public relations, Blatty appeared as a contestant on the Groucho Marx quiz show You Bet Your Life, winning $10,000, enough money to quit his job and to write full-time. Thereafter, he never held a regular job.|$|E

5|$|Reaction to the {{character}} varied, with some, including Spider-Man's creator, Stan Lee, approving {{the creation of a}} positive role model for non-white children, to displeasure at the replacement of Peter Parker, with some decrying it as <b>a</b> <b>publicity</b> stunt motivated by political correctness, a charge Alonso denied. Alexandra Petri of The Washington Post called for {{the character}} to be judged on the quality of its stories, which have garnered positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Keggy's {{introduction}} in 2003, a {{group of}} students stole the Keggy costume from its home in the Sigma Nu fraternity library and sent threatening notes to Keggy's creators, including photographs of the mascot bound and gagged with one black eye. Some thought this to be <b>a</b> <b>publicity</b> stunt by the creators, but the mascot had truly been stolen. Keggy was eventually returned with minor damage to the costume.|$|E
5|$|Some 5,000,000 half dollars were struck, {{far beyond}} the actual demand, and half of them were melted. The {{appropriation}} did not cure the fair's financial woes, as fewer than 400,000 were sold at the premium price, and some 2,000,000 were released into circulation, where they remained {{as late as the}} 1950s. The pieces can be purchased in circulated condition for less than $20; coins in near-pristine state sell for about $1,000, far less than the $10,000 the makers of the Remington Typewriter paid as <b>a</b> <b>publicity</b> stunt in 1892 for the first specimen struck.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} {{featured}} the UFC Welterweight Champion, Georges St-Pierre, defending his title against UFC Lightweight Champion and former UFC Welterweight Champion B.J. Penn. This represented {{the first time}} two current titleholders competed {{against each other in}} the UFC. The contest was heavily promoted, featuring <b>a</b> <b>publicity</b> tour to Canada and Hawaii, as well as the introduction of UFC Primetime, a preview show that cost $1.7 million to produce. The co-main event of the evening was a battle between two undefeated light heavyweights sporting 13–0 records in Lyoto Machida and Thiago Silva.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had done}} with the prior two Adventures, Wallez {{organised}} <b>a</b> <b>publicity</b> stunt to mark the culmination of Tintin in America, in which an actor portraying Tintin arrived in Brussels. It proved the most popular yet. In 1932, the series was collected and published in a single volume by Les Éditions de Petit Vingtième, coinciding with their publication of the first collected volume of Quick and Flupke. A second edition was produced in France by Éditions Ogéo-Cœurs-Vaillants in 1934, while that same year Casterman published an edition, the first of The Adventures of Tintin that they released. In 1936, Casterman asked Hergé to add several new colour plates to a reprint of Tintin in America, which he agreed to. They also asked him to replace the cover with one depicting a car chase, but he refused.|$|E
5|$|As {{indicated}} in the temple records, the priests of the temple were Shiva ascetics called Dandi Sanyasis, who belonged to Nambudiri community, a religious group common in modern Kerala. When {{the last of the}} ascetics died without an heir in 1776 AD, the king invited non-ascetic Nambudiris from Kerala for priesthood, a practice that continues in modern times. Till 1939, all the offerings made by the devotees to the temple went to the Rawal (chief priest), but after 1939, his jurisdiction was restricted to religious affairs. The administrative structure of the temple consists of a chief executive officer who executes the orders from the state government, a deputy chief executive officer, two OSDs, an executive officer, an account officer, a temple officer and <b>a</b> <b>publicity</b> officer to assist the chief executive officer.|$|E
