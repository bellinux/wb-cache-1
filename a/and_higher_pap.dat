40|$|Objective: Chinese {{women have}} {{significantly}} {{lower rates of}} Papanicolaou (Pap) testing than Euro-Canadian women despite efforts to promote testing. Evidence suggests that Chinese women’s reluctance to undergo Pap testing {{may be related to}} culture-linked discomfort with sexuality. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the role of sexuality in the interaction between acculturation and Pap testing. Design: Euro-Canadian (n! 213) and Chinese (n! 260) female university students completed a battery of questionnaires. Main Outcome Measures: Questionnaires assessing sexual knowledge, sexual func-tion, acculturation, and Pap testing frequency. Results: Euro-Canadian women had significantly more accurate sexual knowledge, higher levels of sexual functioning, a broader repertoire of sexual activities, <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> <b>Pap</b> testing rates. Chinese women were more likely to cite embarrassment as a barrier to Pap testing. Heritage acculturation, but not mainstream acculturation, predicted Chinese women’s Pap testing behavior. Mainstream acculturation was associated with more accurate sexual knowledge and greater sexual desire and satisfaction. Conclusion: The findings provide support for the hypothesis that low Pap testing rates in Chinese women may be associated with heritage acculturation, although the hypothesis that sexual function would predict Pap testing behavior was not supported...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the risk of}} a histological diagnosis of cervical cancer following a given Pap test result and for a given history of Pap test results in a screened population across the full spectrum of possible cytological results. Methods: All the Pap screening results held on the New South Wales Pap Test Register for 1997 - 2003 (five million tests for 1. 87 million women) were analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the odds of having a histologically determined cervical cancer for a given Pap test result and test result history. The hazard ratios of having cervical cancer in relation to Pap test result histories were estimated: (i) in regard only to the last Pap test result adjusting for age, frequency of Pap testing <b>and</b> proportion of <b>high</b> grade (≥cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 [CIN 2]) abnormalities found in a woman 2 ̆ 7 s total recorded test result history; and (ii) with regard to the last Pap test result against the highest grade of cytological abnormality found prior to the last Pap test result. The hazard ratios are for a cancer diagnosis occurring before the next Pap test and were adjusted for age, quintile of socioeconomic status of residence, frequency of past Pap testing and proportion of high-grade abnormalities detected in each woman 2 ̆ 7 s prior Pap test history. The adjusted hazard ratios were then applied to the tabulated proportions of referent women with negative cytology in each broad age group, and for all women, to estimate the 2 ̆ 71 in n 2 ̆ 7 odds of being diagnosed histologically with cervical cancer for a given last Pap test result, and by a given last Pap test result for various prior Pap test result histories. Results: After adjusting for age, socioeconomic status, frequency of previous Pap testing and proportion of past high-grade screen-detected abnormalities, the adjusted hazard ratio of having a subsequent cervical cancer diagnosis for women with a negative Pap test result was 1 in 5546, compared with 1 in 833 for a low-grade epithelial abnormality (atypia, CIN 1), 1 in 56 for a high-grade epithelial abnormality and 1 in seven for a cytological prediction of cervical cancer. These odds estimates were significantly modified by age <b>and</b> by the <b>highest</b> <b>Pap</b> test result prior to the most recent Pap test result: the <b>higher</b> the age <b>and,</b> less consistently, the higher the previous <b>highest</b> <b>Pap</b> test result for a given last Pap test result, the shorter the odds of having a subsequent histological diagnosis of cervical cancer. Conclusions: The results presented here will enable clinicians to inform their patients of their chances of being diagnosed with cervical cancer for a given Pap test result, and for some combinations of the last <b>Pap</b> test result <b>and</b> <b>highest</b> recorded prior <b>Pap</b> test result...|$|R

40|$|Disease {{resistance}} exerts {{a fitness}} cost on plants, presumably {{due to the}} extra consumption of energy and carbon. In this study, we examined whether transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana with increased levels of ATP and sucrose is more resistant or susceptible to pathogen infection. Lines of A. thaliana over-expressing purple acid phosphatase 2 (AtPAP 2) (OE lines) contain increased levels of ATP and sucrose, with improved growth rate and seed production. Compared to wild type (WT) and pap 2 lines, the OE lines were more susceptible to several Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) strains carrying AvrRpm 1, AvrRpt 2 AvrRps 4, AvrPtoB, HrcC and WT strain DC 3000. The increased susceptibility of the OE lines to Pst strains cannot solely {{be attributed to the}} suppressed expression of R-genes but must also be attributed to the suppression of downstream signaling components, such as MOS 2, EDS 1 and EDS 5. Before infection, the levels of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) precursor OPDA were similar in the leaves of OE, pap 2 and WT plants, whereas the levels of JA and its derivative JA-Ile were significantly lower in the leaves of OE lines <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> in the <b>pap</b> 2 line. The expression of JA marker defense gene PDF 1. 2 was up-regulated in the OE lines compared to the WT prior to Pst DC 3000 infection, but its expression was lower in the OE lines after infection.

40|$|Portopulmoanry {{hypertension}} (POPH) {{is a form}} of pulmonary {{arterial hypertension}} (PAH) associated with portal hypertension with or without underlying chronic liver disease. POPH is increasingly recognized and recent evidence suggests that {{it is one of the}} leading causes of PAH. The pathophysiology of POPH is poorly understood although the pathological changes in pulmonary vasculature in advanced POPH are similar to those seen in idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. The prognosis in patients with liver disease who also suffer from significant POPH is considered to be poor. Higher degree of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) may preclude a patient from liver transplant as mortality in these patients is high. The treatment with vasodilator therapy has shown to improve both hemodynamics and clinical outcome in POPH in retrospective studies and in some case series.

40|$|Perinatal {{exposure}} to chronic hypoxia induces sustained hypertension and structural and functional {{changes in the}} pulmonary vascular bed. We hypothesized that highland newborn lambs (HLNB, 3600 m) have a higher pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) {{due in part to}} a higher activity/expression of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE 5). We administered sildenafil, a PDE 5 inhibitor, during basal and hypoxic conditions in the pulmonary hypertensive HLNB and compared them to lowland newborn lambs (LLNB, 580 m). Additionally, we compared the vasodilator responses to sildenafil in isolated small pulmonary arteries and the PDE 5 mRNA expression and evaluated the vascular remodeling by histomorphometric analysis in these newborn lambs. Under basal conditions, HLNB had a <b>higher</b> <b>PAP</b> <b>and</b> cardiac output compared with LLNB. Sildenafil decreased the PAP during basal conditions and completely prevented the PAP increase during hypoxia in both groups. HLNB showed a greater contractile capacity <b>and</b> a <b>higher</b> maximal dilation to sildenafil. PDE 5 mRNA expression did not show significant differences between HLNB and LLNB. The distal pulmonary arteries showed an increased wall thickness in HLNB.

40|$|Background : Appropriate {{determination}} of tidal volume (VT) {{is important for}} preventing ventilation induced lung injury. We compared hemodynamic and respiratory parameters in two conditions of receiving VTs calculated by using body weight (BW), which was estimated by measured height (HBW) or demi-span based body weight (DBW). Materials and Methods : This controlled-trial was conducted in St. Alzahra Hospital in 2009 on American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II, 18 - 65 -years-old patients. Standing height and weight were measured and then height was calculated using demi-span method. BW and VT were calculated with acute respiratory distress syndrome-net formula. Patients were randomized and then crossed to receive ventilation with both calculated VTs for 20 min. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were analyzed with SPSS version 20. 0 using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results : Forty nine patients were studied. Demi-span based body weight and thus VT (DTV) were lower than Height based body weight and VT (HTV) (P = 0. 028), in male patients (P = 0. 005).

40|$|IntroductionExercise {{pulmonary}} hypertension (PHT) can develop {{in patients with}} organic mitral regurgitation (OMR), even when resting pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) is normal. However, systolic PAP is not always available during stress echocardiography. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify resting echocardiographic predictors of exercise PHT in OMR. Method and resultsResting and exercise transthoracic echocardiography including Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) quantification were performed in 66 consecutive patients (61 ± 15 years, 55 % of male) with moderate to severe OMR. LV longitudinal and filling functions were quantified by peak and time-to-peak velocities (TP) using TDI for Ea- and Sa-wave. PAP was derived from transtricuspid pressure gradient and was available during exercise in 52 patients (79 %). Systolic PAP significantly increased during exercise (from 31 ± 10 to 54 ± 17 mmHg, p< 0. 01) and exercise PHT (exercise PAP ≥ 60 mmHg) was observed in 24 patients (46 %). Patients with exercise PHT were significantly older (69 ± 11 vs. 59 ± 15 yrs, p= 0. 004) <b>and</b> had <b>higher</b> resting <b>PAP</b> (36 ± 9 vs. 27 ± 7 mmHg, p= 0. 0004), higher septal E/Ea ratio (16 ± 6 vs. 13 ± 4, p= 0. 03), slower TP-Sa (127 ± 27 vs. 153 ± 30 ms, p= 0. 002) and TP-Ea (456 ± 48 vs. 483 ± 50 ms, p= 0. 03) and lower septal Ea velocity (6. 4 ± 2 vs. 7. 4 ± 3 cm/s, p= 0. 01). Exercise PAP was correlated with age (r= 0. 39, p= 0. 004), resting TP-Sa (r= 0. 42, p= 0. 002) and septal E/Ea ratio (r= 0. 28, p= 0. 04). On multivariate analysis, after adjustment for age, sex and septal E/Ea ratio, the independent predictors of exercise PHT were resting systolic PAP (Odds-ratio (OR) = 1. 25, 95 %CI: 1. 05 - 1. 4, p= 0. 003) and TPSa (OR= 1. 04, 95 %CI: 1. 01 - 1. 1, p= 0. 03).

40|$|Pulmonary {{vascular}} remodeling during chronic hypoxia may be {{the result}} of either oxygen deprivation or erythrocytosis. To separate experimentally the effects of hypoxia and erythrocytosis, we analyzed transgenic mice that constitutively overexpress the human erythropoietin gene in an oxygen-independent manner. These mice are characterized by polycythemia but have normal blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output. In transgenic mice, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) was increased in vivo but was reduced in blood-free perfused lungs. The thromboxane receptor agonist U 46619 caused a smaller rise in PAP in isolated transgenic lungs than in lungs from wild-type mice. The transgenic pulmonary vasculature was characterized by elevated prostacyclin production, stronger endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression, and reduced pulmonary vascular smooth muscle thickness. The fact that transgenic polycythemic mice have marked pulmonary hypertension in vivo but not in vitro suggests that their pulmonary hypertension is due to the increased blood viscosity, thus supporting an independent role of polycythemia in the development of pulmonary hypertension. In addition, our findings indicate that the lungs of transgenic animals adapt to the <b>high</b> <b>PAP</b> by elevated synthesis of vasodilators and reduced vascular smooth muscle thickness that tend to reduce vascular tone and vascular responsiveness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Degradation of tensile {{properties}} resulting from geometrical discontinuities due to localized pitting is usually evaluated {{in terms of}} the reduced section thickness associated with pit geometry which lowers the load carrying capacity of the structure. However, the effects of finer parameters associated with pit distributions such as pit area percent (PAP) are not usually taken into account. In this research, the effects of spacing, depth and PAP on {{tensile properties}} of a structural steel are investigated. Simulated pit distributions were produced on the gage sections of flat tensile specimens using mechanical drilling. It is found that final elongation is more adversely affected than tensile strength with increasing PAP, pith depth and pith spacing. However, the reduction in final elongation tends to be largely recovered at <b>higher</b> <b>PAP</b> values due to increasing uniformity of strain distribution. It is noted that increasing pit spacing at a constant PAP leads to greater reductions in tensile properties, especially at higher pit depths, due to the increased stress concentration and strain localization. It is further clarifies that the introduction of first few pits and their growth to larger depths could be very detrimental to the mechanical properties of structural alloys...|$|R

Lowland (LLNB; 580 m) and highland (HLNB; 3, 600 m) newborn lambs were cathetherized under general anesthesia and submitted to acute sustained or stepwise hypoxic episodes. Contractile and dilator responses of isolated pulmonary and femoral small arteries were analyzed in a wire myograph. Under basal conditions, HLNB had a higher pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP; 20. 2 +/- 2. 4 vs. 13. 6 +/- 0. 5 mmHg, P < 0. 05) and cardiac output (342 +/- 23 vs. 279 +/- 13 ml x min(- 1) x kg(- 1), P < 0. 05) compared with LLNB. In small pulmonary arteries, HLNB showed greater contractile capacity <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> sensitivity to nitric oxide.

MÉTODOS: 2281 mulheres foram submetidas a exame clínico além da coleta de {{material}} para citologia, para CH II para detecção de DNA-HPV. Foi feita a inspeção visual do colo após aplicação do ácido acético a 5 % (IVA). As mulheres com pelo menos um exame positivo eram convocadas para colposcopia, que também foi realizada em 420 mulheres com todos os exames normais. O desempenho dos testes foi calculado utilizando como padrão ouro a colposcopia com ou sem biopsia. RESULTADOS: a CO foi anormal em 209 mulheres (9, 2 %); a CH II foi positiva em 399 (17, 5 %) e em 249 (10, 9 %) foram encontradas alterações na IVA. Entre as 2281 mulheres avaliadas, 671 (29, 4 %) apresentaram pelo menos um resultado de exame positivo, embora apenas 82 (3, 6 %) apresentassem doença confirmada histologicamente (50 NIC 1, 20 NIC 2, sete NIC 3 e cinco carcinomas invasores). As sensibilidades da IVA e da CH II foram semelhantes e significativamente maiores que a da CO. A especificidade da CO foi maior que a da IVA e da CH II.

This analysis revealed that pentraxin-related protein, interferon-related developmental regulator, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator- 1 α were differentially expressed (P < 0. 05) in steer right ventricle from high-PAP cows compared with low-PAP cows. Also, activation peptide and pancreas cationic trypsinogen, α-actin, similar to ubiquitin carboxylesterase, were differently expressed (P < 0. 05) in steers from Restricted cows compared with those from Control cows. Upregulated genes in high-PAP right ventricle have been associated with pathological cardiac hypertrophy. It is concluded that right ventricle gene expression may be differentially programmed by maternal undernutrition in the fetus during early gestation and may be detrimental to health and longevity of offspring, particularly at high altitude...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} mitral valve hemodynamic performance and functional capacity in patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) who underwent restrictive mitral valve annuloplasty (MVA). BackgroundRestrictive MVA combined with coronary artery bypass graft is the conventional approach for the surgical management of patients with ischemic MR. We hypothesized that the restriction of the mitral annulus could cause an obstruction to antegrade mitral flow that may affect the patient's functional capacity. MethodsA dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and a 6 -min walk test (6 MWT) were performed in 24 patients with ischemic MR 13 ± 3 months after restrictive MVA and coronary artery bypass graft and in 20 control patients with coronary artery disease matched for age, gender, and left ventricular ejection fraction. ResultsNone of the 24 MVA patients had significant MR after operation. Compared with control patients, MVA patients had significantly (p < 0. 001) <b>higher</b> resting <b>and</b> stress peak gradients (rest: 13 ± 4 mm Hg vs. 4 ± 1 mm Hg; DSE: 19 ± 6 mm Hg vs. 6 ± 3 mm Hg) and systolic pulmonary arterial pressures (PAP) (rest: 42 ± 13 mm Hg vs. 27 ± 8 mm Hg; DSE: 58 ± 12 mm Hg vs. 38 ± 11 mm Hg) and lower (p = 0. 01) 6 MWT distance (358 ± 95 m vs. 433 ± 61 m). The resting peak mitral gradient correlated with systolic PAP (r = − 0. 67; p = 0. 001) and 6 MWT distance (r = − 0. 78; p < 0. 0001) in the MVA group. ConclusionsThe results suggest that performing a restrictive MVA in patients with ischemic MR may create a functional mitral stenosis. This hemodynamic sequel is associated with <b>higher</b> <b>PAP</b> <b>and</b> a worse functional capacity...|$|R
40|$|Total acid {{phosphatase}} (TAP), prostatic {{acid phosphatase}} (PAP) and non-prostatic acid phosphatase (NPAP) serum concentrations were determined using a spectrophotometric technique in 52 healthy dogs, 15 male dogs suffering from non-prostatic diseases and in 19 dogs suffering from prostatic diseases (12 dogs with {{benign prostatic hypertrophy}} and seven dogs with prostatic adenocarcinoma). TAP, PAP and NPAP serum concentrations did not differ between normal male and normal female dogs. Dogs with prostatic adenocarcinoma had significantly <b>higher</b> TAP, <b>PAP</b> <b>and</b> NPAP serum concentrations than dogs with benign prostatic hypertrophy, normal dogs and dogs with non-prostatic disease. The authors conclude that low serum concentrations of TAP and PAP do not rule out prostatic adenocarcinoma in the dog, but elevated concentrations can be useful criteria for the diagnosis of canine prostatic cancer...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Given limited prior {{evidence}} of {{high rates of}} cervical cancer in Haitian immigrant women in the U. S., {{this study was designed}} to examine self-reported Pap smear screening rates for Haitian immigrant women and compare them to rates for women of other ethnicities. METHODS: Multi-ethnic women at least 40 years of age living in neighborhoods with large Haitian immigrant populations in eastern Massachusetts were surveyed in 2000 - 2002. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine the effect of demographic and health care characteristics on Pap smear rates. RESULTS: Overall, 81 % (95 % confidence interval 79 %, 84 %) of women in the study sample reported having had a Pap smear within three years. In unadjusted analyses, Pap smear rates differed by ethnicity (p= 0. 003), with women identified as Haitian having a lower crude Pap smear rate (78 %) than women identified as African American (87 %), English-speaking Caribbean (88 %), or Latina (92 %). Women identified as Haitian had a higher rate than women identified as non-Hispanic white (74 %). Adjustment for differences in demographic factors known to predict Pap smear acquisition (age, marital status, education level, and household income) only partially accounted for the observed difference in Pap smear rates. However, adjustment for these variables as well as those related to health care access (single site for primary care, health insurance status, and physician gender) eliminated the ethnic difference in Pap smear rates. CONCLUSIONS: The lower crude Pap smear rate for Haitian immigrants relative to other women of color was in part due to differences in (1) utilization of a single source for primary care, (2) health insurance, and (3) care provided by female physicians. Public health programs, such as the cancer prevention programs currently utilized in eastern Massachusetts, may influence these factors. Thus, the relatively <b>high</b> <b>Pap</b> rate among women in this study may reflect the success of these programs. Public health and elected officials will need to consider closely how implementing or withdrawing these programs may impact immigrant and minority communities...|$|R
40|$|A set of cranial {{characters}} {{was examined}} in the fruit bats Rousettus egyptiacus and Eidolon helvum to compare trends and relative importance of major components of bilateral morphometric variation, and their relationship with character size. Using two-way, sides-by-individuals A N O V A, four components of variation were estimated for each bilateral variable: individual variation (I), directional asymmetry (DA), non-directional asymmetry (NDA) and meas- urement error (E). Both species exhibit similar major trends of variation in asymmetry across characters, as shown by principal component analysis, using variance components as variables. Degree of interspecific congruence among characters was confirmed by a two-way A N O V A with species and variance components as fixed factors. Congruence of asymmetry patterns between species suggests {{that the concept of}} population asymmetry parameter (PAP) could be extended to <b>higher</b> hierarchies. <b>PAPs</b> above the species level may result from common mechanisms or similar developmental constraints acting on species’ buffering capacities and morphological integration processesPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background It is {{well known}} that lipids {{abnormally}} accumulate in the alveoli during idiopathic pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). It is unclear, however, whether lipids also abnormally accumulate in serum. This study investigated the serum lipid panels in idiopathic PAP patients and explored the relationships between serum levels and the severity of idiopathic PAP. Methods and Results Clinical data including the level of serum lipids were evaluated in 33 non-diabetic idiopathic PAP patients and 157 healthy volunteers. Serum levels of triglyceride were <b>higher</b> in <b>PAP</b> patients than in healthy subjects (median: 192. 00 mg/dl (P 25 : 104. 36, P 75 : 219. 00) vs 119. 56 mg/dl (P 25 : 78. 81, P 75 : 193. 03), P vs 51. 34 ± 12. 06 mg/dl, P 2 (r = - 0. 403, P P Conclusions <b>PAP</b> associates with <b>high</b> triglyceride <b>and</b> low HDL levels in the serum, and these lipids provide potential intervention strategy for treatment. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Post-activation {{potentiation}} (PAP) is {{a phenomenon}} where force output is acutely enhanced following muscular contraction. Previous research has documented enhanced performance in power-type light exercise following a heavy pre-load, such as vertical jumps following heavy squats. To date, the effect of PAP on moderately heavy exercise following a heavy pre-load has not been investigated. Purpose: The purpose was to examine whether PAP could be elicited in moderately heavy squats following a heavy squat pre-load, and if so, what intensity (as percentage of one repetition-maximum [1 RM]) of pre-load elicited the <b>highest</b> <b>PAP</b> effect (measured as mean power, mean force and number of repetitions performed). Subjects: Seventeen resistance-trained males (age 24 ± 2 years, length 182 ± 8 cm, body mass 84. 7 ± 13. 1 kg, squat 1 RM 147. 6 ± 29. 6 kg) with at least 2 years of experience of the squat exercise. Methods: After testing parallel squat 1 RM at a separate session, subjects performed three testing sessions in a randomized order in a cross-over design; performance test at 80 % of parallel squat 1 RM (control), one repetition at 85 % of 1 RM followed 8 minutes later by the same performance test (PAP 85), and one repetition at 93 % of 1 RM followed 8 minutes later by the same performance test (PAP 93). Sessions were separated by six days. Force and power output was recorded using a linear encoder. Friedman’s {{test was used to}} reveal differences between conditions, and a Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to identify these differences. Results: There was an increase in number of repetitions performed for PAP 85 (p= 0. 009) and PAP 93 (p= 0. 001) compared to control, but not for mean power or mean force. There {{was no significant difference between}} PAP 85 and PAP 93 for number of repetitions (p= 0. 091). Conclusion: PAP can be elicited to improve performance in moderately heavy squats following a heavy squat pre-load in trained subjects, but only measured as number of repetitions performed, not force or power. PAP could therefore be useful not only for designing power training, but also for strength and hypertrophy training.

40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the frequency of unexplained pulmonary hypertension (PHT) among patients on hemodialysis at 2 centers and to evaluate possible predisposing factors. Materials and Methods. In this cross-sectional study, PHT was screened by Doppler echocardiography on the day after dialysis in 62 patients with end-stage renal disease receiving maintenance hemodialysis via arteriovenous access. Pulmonary hypertension was defined as a systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (<b>PAP)</b> <b>higher</b> than 35 mm Hg, and the systolic PAP was calculated using the modified Bernoulli equation. Clinical variables were compared between patients with and without PHT. Results. A <b>PAP</b> <b>higher</b> than 35 mm Hg was found in 32 patients (49. 3 %) receiving hemodialysis, with a mean systolic PAP of 39. 58 ± 13. 27 mm Hg. Blood hemoglobin level was significantly lower in the patients with PHT than those without PHT (9. 8 ± 1. 97 g/dL versus 11. 07 ± 1. 86 g/dL; P =. 01). In addition, serum levels of albumin was lower in these patients (3. 38 ± 0. 32 g/dL versus 3. 75 ± 0. 44 g/dL; P =. 02). Conclusions. This study demonstrates a surprisingly high prevalence of PHT among patients with end-stage renal disease receiving hemodialysis. We concluded that the best approach to this unrecognized complication that is associated with reduced survival is keeping it in mind and looking for it in the management of patients on dialysis. </p...|$|R

We identified the risk factors for PAH and their effects on acute exacerbation and mortality in patients with TDL, {{as well as the}} clinical differences in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and PAH. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2010 through 2015 in a municipal referral hospital in South Korea. PAH was defined when echocardiographic pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) was > 40 mmHg. The clinical features and course of TDL patients with or without PAH were evaluated and differences between patients with COPD and PAH were analyzed. Results: Among the 195 patients with TDL, echocardiographic data were available in 53 patients, and their mean PAP was 50. 72 ± 23. 99 mmHg. The PAH group (n= 37) had a smaller lung volume (forced vital capacity % predicted, 51. 55 % vs 72. 37 %, P< 0. 001) and more extensively destroyed lungs (3. 27 lobes vs 2 lobes, P< 0. 001) than those in the non-PAH group (n= 16). A <b>higher</b> <b>PAP</b> was significantly correlated with a higher frequency of acute exacerbation (r= 0. 32, P= 0. 02). Multivariate analyses did not reveal any significant risk factors contributing to PAH in patients with TDL. Compared to COPD patients with PAH, TDL patients with PAH have smaller lung volume but a less severe airflow limitation. Tricuspid regurgitation and a D-shaped left ventricle during diastole were more frequently observed in TDL patients. The risk of exacerbation was not different between patients with PAH in COPD and TDL. Conclusion: PAH in patients with TDL was associated with severity of lung destruction but risk of exacerbation and mortality did not significantly differ between patients with PAH and without PAH.

40|$|Objective: To {{know the}} {{long-term}} results of percutaneous transmitral commissurotomy (PTMC) and fate of pulmonary hypertension {{in children who}} have undergone PTMC. Material: During the last 11 years 138 children, aged 10. 48 ± 2. 24 years (range 3. 5 - 16) had PTMC. Indications were echocardiographic evidence of moderate to severe mitral stenosis (MS) plus pulmonary hypertension (PH) more than 50 mmHg and/or FC III-IV Result: Pre PTMC, mean pressure gradient (MPG) across the mitral valve (MV) was 18. 6 mmHg ± 3. 4 which decreased to 7. 6 mmHg ± 2. 21. Mitral valve area (MVA) was 0. 62 cm 2 ± 0. 12 which increased to 1. 6 cm 2 ± 0. 3. Systolic Pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) was 83 mmHg ± 13 decreased to 50 mmHg ± 14. 5. Three procedures were unsuccessful. There were 2 deaths, one within half an hour in patient with SPAP of 100 mmHg and left ventricle (LV) dysfunction, had no mitral regurgitation (MR),arrhythmias or tamponade after PTMC. Another had thromboembolism of left anterior descending coronary artery during procedure; he revived and had successful PTMC but died after 24 hours. One had tamponade which was drained and had a successful PTMC after 1 week. There was no change in Mitral Regurgitation in 50 pts. After a mean follow-up period of 44. 3 months ± 30. 6 of 110 pts (10 months to 10 years), 8 needed repeat PTMC after 5. 37 ± 2. 3 yrs (0. 5 – 8 years), and 2 had mitral valve replacement (MVR) after 1 and 7 years. SPAP was 83 mmHg ± 13 pre procedures which decreased to 50 mm Hg ± 14. 5 immediately after and to 42 mmHg ± 13 after 6 months. Immediately after PTMC, 54 pts had SPAP more than 50 mmHg and after 6 months only 24 pts. Out of these 2 died: one had severe PH despite adequate relief of MV, died after 3 years; another had mild MS and + 2 MR with persistent severe PAH, had MVR after 1 year. PAP did not decline after surgery and he died two years after PTMC. Both had initial SPAP of more than 100 mmHg. Conclusion: PTMC is effective in reliving stenosis, however initial <b>high</b> <b>PAP</b> is predictor of persistent pulmonary hypertension...|$|R
