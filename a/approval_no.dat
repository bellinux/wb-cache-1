The plan included proposals for new laws to be passed by Congress, and a series of executive actions not requiring Congressional <b>approval.</b> <b>No</b> new federal gun control legislation was passed {{as a result of these}} proposals.

50|$|In the United Kingdom, local {{authorities}} will first need to approve any application {{for an event}} to which the public is admitted. No <b>approval,</b> <b>no</b> event.

An added complication is a whole new raft of legislation concerning Health & Safety in particular Corporate Manslaughter, which can involve the event organiser being charged with a criminal offence if any of the insurances and risk assessments are not fully completed well in advance of the event. If this very basic step isn't completed then any further activity should be halted until it is.|$|E

50|$|Originally, West College Corner, Indiana, and College Corner, Ohio, {{operated}} separate schools. Upon {{the advice}} of the Indiana and Ohio Attorneys General, the two towns' school boards organized a shared College Corner Union School in September 1893. Unlike later interstate school districts, which were formed under interstate compacts with Congressional <b>approval,</b> <b>no</b> legislative approval was initially sought for the new school district. Instead, concurrent (but not joint) school boards of three members each oversaw the school and state funding was apportioned by enrollment. For the first school year, higher grades were held in Indiana while lower grades were held in Ohio. The new school building, which cost $12,000 and straddled the Indiana-Ohio state line, opened the fall of 1894. Union Township School later merged with College Corner Union School.|$|E

5000|$|Count Sergei Witte, the Tsar's Minister of Finance {{and recent}} Russian {{plenipotentiary}} at the Treaty of Portsmouth negotiations (ending {{the war with}} Japan), was named chairman of the Tsar's Council of Ministers after returning home from New Hampshire.

Nicholas strenuously resisted these ideas, but gave in after his first choice to head a military dictatorship, Grand Duke Nicholas, threatened to shoot himself in the head if the Tsar did not accept Witte's suggestion. Nicholas unwillingly agreed, and issued {{what became known as the}} October Manifesto on [...] 1905, promising basic civil rights and an elected parliament called the Duma, without whose <b>approval</b> <b>no</b> laws were to be enacted in Russia in the future.|$|E
5000|$|The coup in 1968 led to {{the rise}} of the Ba’ath Party as it regained control. The coup in 1968 {{led to the}} {{establishment}} of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council which became the ultimate decision-making body in Iraq during the Ba’ath’s rule from 1968 to 2003. Accordingly [...] "under a provisional constitution adopted by the party in 1970, Iraq was confirmed as a republic, with legislative power theoretically vested in an elected legislature but also in the party-run RCC, without whose <b>approval</b> <b>no</b> law could be promulgated." [...] Furthermore, [...] "second to the council in political importance was the Regional Command of the Baath, the party executive, and third was the Council of Ministers."

50|$|The Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon (The Synod of Mar Isaac) met in 410 AD {{under the}} {{presidency}} of Mar Isaac, the bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon. The most important decision of the Synod which had a very far reaching effect {{on the life of}} the church, was to declare the bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon as the primate of the Church of the East; and in recognition of this pre-eminence he was given the title ‘Catholicos’. The Synod confirmed Mar Isaac as Catholicos and Archbishop of all the Orient. The Synod also declared its adherence to the decision of the Council of Nicaea and subscribed to the Nicene Creed. The Canons of the Synod leave no doubt as to the authority of the great Metropolitan, the Catholicos of Seleucia-Ctesiphon. Without his <b>approval,</b> <b>no</b> election of bishop would be valid.|$|E
