5|$|A transit of Venus {{across the}} Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring {{a small portion}} of) the solar disk. During a transit, Venus {{can be seen from}} Earth as a small black disk moving <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the Sun. The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth.|$|E
5|$|By the 17th century, two {{developments}} {{allowed for}} the transits of planets <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the Sun to be predicted and observed: the telescope and the new astronomy of Johannes Kepler, which assumed elliptical, rather than circular, planetary orbits.|$|E
5|$|The {{planet was}} {{confirmed}} by the Kepler satellite by the transit method, in which the planet passes <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> its star in relation to Earth, dimming that star's light by a small amount; this light difference is then {{used to determine the}} planet and several of its characteristics, including size and distance from its home star.|$|E

5000|$|In the Gates of the Mountains {{there have}} been many blowups. Now there are many rattlesnakes and nothing more fragile than {{mountain}} goats, themselves tougher than the mountains they disdain, although at a distance they are white wings of butterflies floating up and down and sideways <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> fragments of arches and cliffs, touching but never becoming attached to them.

5|$|It {{was seen}} in Figure2 that Foucault placed the {{rotating}} mirror R {{as close as possible}} to lens L so as to maximize the distance between R and the slit S. As R rotates, an enlarged image of slit S sweeps <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the distant mirror M. The greater the distance RM, the more quickly that the image sweeps across mirror M and the less light is reflected back. Foucault could not increase the RM distance in his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20meters without the image of the slit becoming too dim to accurately measure.|$|E
5|$|Less than 30seconds {{after the}} {{subsequent}} kick-off, United forced another corner, but Schmeichel stayed in his penalty area this time under instruction from Ferguson. Beckham again swung the corner in, finding {{the head of}} Sheringham, who nodded the ball down <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> goal. Solskjær reacted fastest, shot out a foot and poked {{the ball into the}} roof of the Bayern goal for United to take the lead. The goal was timed at 90+2:17'. Solskjær celebrated by sliding on his knees, mimicking Basler's earlier celebration, before quickly being mobbed by the United players, substitutes and coaching staff. Schmeichel, in his own penalty area, cartwheeled with glee.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} was dull. Brugge held back, using tight marking and the offside trap to {{restrict}} Liverpool's attacking threat. Towards {{the end of}} the first half, Liverpool started to have more scoring chances. Ray Kennedy volleyed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the goal, and Jimmy Case took a free kick that needed to be punched away by Brugge goalkeeper Birger Jensen. In the closing minutes of the first half, Jensen made two crucial saves: he blocked David Fairclough, who had made a run towards goal, and he tipped a header by Alan Hansen over the crossbar. So the score at half-time was 0–0.|$|E
50|$|The main {{armament}} of {{the fort}} was placed on two west facing earth bastions with a central curtain providing more guns firing through embrasures. Flanking fire for ditch defence was provided for musketry only. Two bastionettes {{were placed on the}} far side of the wet ditch, one at each shoulder. Two more flanking galleries fired <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curtain and bastions.|$|R

This {{was done by}} a machine where a number of blocks were clamped in the {{periphery}} of a revolving wheel. The cutter was swept in a curve <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blocks as they rotated. The radius of the curve was controlled by a former. After each cut the blocks were turned 90 degrees to bring up a new face.|$|R
5|$|A {{dominant}} male black wildebeest {{will have}} a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them. The breeding season occurs {{at the end of}} the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. When one of his females comes into oestrus the male concentrates on her and mates with her several times. Sexual behaviour by the male at this time includes stretching low, ears down, sniffing of the female's vulva, performing ritual urination and touching his chin to the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps her tail upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes it <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the male. The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, touching his rump with her snout. During the breeding season, the male loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males.|$|E
5|$|Bolton {{started the}} second half on the attack. Bolton were awarded a free-kick, {{following}} a foul on Thompson, by Liverpool defender Rob Jones, who was shown a yellow card. From the subsequent free-kick, Bolton striker John McGinlay received the ball, keeping it from the onrushing James, his pass into the Liverpool penalty area found Mixu Paatelainen whose volleyed shot went wide of the Liverpool goal. Bolton had another attack almost immediately. A pass by McAteer found Thompson {{on the right side}} of the pitch, but his shot went <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the Liverpool goal. Liverpool began to assert more pressure following the attack. A pass by striker Ian Rush in the 52nd minute found Bjørnebye, whose subsequent shot hit the post. Another Liverpool attack was stopped by Bolton defender Mark Seagraves as he intercepted a cross from Bjørnebye to Rush, but his interception went towards the Bolton goal and was only stopped by Branagan.|$|E
5|$|During this fighting, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade {{had been}} sent to {{reinforce}} the Anzac Mounted Division, while the 5th Mounted Brigade remained in corps reserve armed with swords. With all brigades of both mounted divisions already committed to the battle, the only brigade available was the 4th Light Horse Brigade, which was ordered to capture Beersheba. These swordless mounted infantrymen galloped over the plain, riding towards the town and a redoubt supported by entrenchments on a mound of Tel es Saba south-east of Beersheba. The 4th Light Horse Regiment on the right jumped trenches before turning to make a dismounted attack on the Ottoman infantry in the trenches, gun pits, and redoubts. Most of the 12th Light Horse Regiment on the left rode on <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the main redoubt to find a gap in the Ottoman defenses, crossing the railway line into Beersheba to complete the first step of an offensive which culminated in the EEF capturing Jerusalem six weeks later.|$|E

50|$|The {{technique}} is principally used when film or video material is not available. Action {{is given to}} still photographs by slowly zooming in on subjects of interest and panning from one subject to another. For example, in {{a photograph of a}} baseball team, one might slowly pan <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> players and come to a rest on the player the narrator is discussing. By employing simulated parallax, a two-dimensional image can appear as 3D, with the viewpoint seeming to enter the picture and move among the figures.|$|R

5|$|United {{then went}} back downfield and Ronaldo took on Lauren, who dared not dive in for a tackle and risk a second yellow card. Ronaldo got past the Cameroonian full-back and then chipped a cross into the penalty area, but Van Nistelrooy was unable to make enough contact with the ball to force his header on target. A minute later, Silvestre found Rooney with another {{diagonal}} pass; Rooney attempted to drive in a low cross, but it ended up heading towards goal and came back off {{the foot of the}} post. Fletcher was first to the ball but he fired a shot <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the goal and out for a goal kick. With their very next attack, United sent Ronaldo away down the left wing again; he sent over another cross, but it was again too far in front of Van Nistelrooy.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Bostwick {{scored in}} a {{pre-season}} friendly against Hitchin Town, {{and made his}} first league appearance in the club's 2–2 draw with Macclesfield Town, playing the whole match. He scored his first goal {{of the season in}} the club's first ever Football League victory, in a 3–1 win against Stockport County, scoring with a shot from 30yards to double Stevenage's lead just before the interval. In November 2010, Bostwick provided two assists for Stevenage's goals in the club's 3–0 win away at local rivals Barnet. Bostwick scored his second goal of the 2010–11 season in Stevenage's 3–1 FA Cup win over Newcastle United in January 2011. Bostwick picked up a loose pass and rifled a shot that went in off the post from 25yards out to give Stevenage a two-goal lead. A month later, he scored his third goal of the season in a 4–0 win against Cheltenham Town, cutting in from the right and drilling a low shot <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> goal and past the goalkeeper. Bostwick played a total of 51 matches during the 2010–11 season, scoring three goals. This included three appearances in the 2010–11 League Two play-offs following Stevenage's sixth-placed finish. Following a 3–0 aggregate victory over Accrington Stanley, Stevenage earned promotion to League One after a 1–0 win against Torquay United at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011, with Bostwick playing the whole match.|$|E
5|$|Cresswell {{retired from}} playing {{as a result}} of an eye {{complaint}} and a knee injury. York drew 1–1 away to Burton Albion, with an own goal scored by Shane Cansdell-Sherriff giving York the lead in the 64th minute before the home team equalised eight minutes later through Billy Kee. Atkinson was released after failing to force himself into the first team and signed for Scarborough Athletic, with whom he had been on loan. York drew 0–0 at home with second-placed Oxford United, in which Carson came closest to scoring with a volley that flashed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the goal. This was followed by another draw after the match awa to Accrington Stanley finished 1–1, with the home team equalising 10 minutes after a Fletcher penalty had given York the lead in the 35th minute. Striker Shaq McDonald, who had been released by Peterborough United, was signed on a contract until the end of the season. York's last match of 2013 was a 2–1 defeat away to Bury, a result that ended York's run of consecutive draws at five. The home team were 2–0 up by the 19th minute, before Michael Coulson scored York's goal in the 73rd minute. This result meant York would begin 2014 in 22nd-position in the table, only out of the relegation zone on goal difference.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{was focused on}} the utilization of pyroelectric crystals for generation of radiation. When in constant temperature pyroelectric crystals are spontaneously polarized. The polarization causes internal charges to accumulate near <b>the</b> crystal <b>faces</b> and masking charges from the environment are attracted to <b>the</b> crystal <b>faces</b> and neutralize <b>the</b> charge. When a pyroelectric crystal is heated or cooled it becomes depolarized and the surface charges become available. If the heating or cooling is done on a crystal in vacuum where no masking charges are available, the crystal becomes a charged capacitor and because of its small capacitance large potential develops <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crystal...|$|R
40|$|The time-dependent, {{three-dimensional}} incompressible Navier-Stokes equations {{are presently}} solved in generalized coordinate systems {{by means of}} a fractional-step method whose primitive variable formulation uses as dependent variables, in place of the Cartesian components of the velocity: (1) pressure (defined {{at the center of the}} computational cell), and (2) volume fluxes <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cells. The momentum equations are solved {{by means of a}}n approximate factorization method. A novel 'ZEBRA' scheme incorporating four-color ordering efficiently solves the Poisson equation.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{an experiment in}} which the iCub humanoid robot learns to recognize faces through proprioceptive information.

The displacement of the fingers, as the robot explores <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> is used to build a model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> using Hidden Markov Models. We show that the robot can successfully distinguish <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> a standard doll and <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> three humanoid robots, the HOAP- 3 robot, a Robota doll robot and MyDreamBaby, a commercial robotic doll...|$|R
40|$|The {{numerical}} computations {{were conducted}} using the CFD-CHEMKIN computational program. A cell-centered control volume approach was used, {{in which the}} discretized equations or the finite difference equations (FDE) were formulated by evaluating and integrating fluxes <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> control volumes {{in order to satisfy}} the continuity, momentum, energy and mixture fractions conservation equations. The first order upwind scheme and the well-known SIMPLEC algorithm were used. The standard k-{var_epsilon} model was used to close the set of equations. The thermal and composition fields in the baseline, cascade, swirl, and swirl-cascade burners were simulated. The temperature and CO{sub 2 } concentration fields were just computed and the observations are reported. The analysis of these results is currently underway...|$|R
