5|$|After the 1841 general election, Melbourne was {{replaced}} as Prime Minister by Sir Robert Peel, who appointed Albert {{as chairman of}} the Royal Commission in charge of redecorating the new Palace of Westminster.

Albert was more successful as a private patron and collector. Among his notable purchases were early German and Italian paintings—such as Lucas Cranach the Elder's Apollo <b>and</b> <b>Diana</b> and Fra Angelico's St Peter Martyr—and contemporary pieces from Franz Xaver Winterhalter and Edwin Landseer. , of Dresden, assisted Albert in buying pictures of the highest quality.|$|E

5|$|For {{his second}} envoi, {{not wishing to}} test the Académie's {{tolerance}} too far, Bizet proposed to submit a quasi-religious work {{in the form of}} a secular mass on a text by Horace. This work, entitled Carmen Saeculare, was intended as a song to Apollo <b>and</b> <b>Diana.</b> No trace exists, and it is unlikely that Bizet ever started it. A tendency to conceive ambitious projects, only to quickly abandon them, became a feature of Bizet's Rome years; in addition to Carmen Saeculare, he considered and discarded at least five opera projects, two attempts at a symphony, and a symphonic ode on the theme of Ulysses and Circe. After Don Procopio, Bizet completed only one further work in Rome, the symphonic poem Vasco da Gama. This replaced Carmen Saeculare as his second envoi, and was well received by the Académie, though swiftly forgotten thereafter.|$|E
