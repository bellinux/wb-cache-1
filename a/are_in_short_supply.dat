5|$|Even {{though most}} {{consumer}} items <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> in North Korea, {{there is a}} considerable variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco is preferred, and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese are popular with the elite and preferred over domestic cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, {{the date of the}} Korean Armistice Agreement, are veritable status symbols. Menthol cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette flavour.|$|E
5|$|When the Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} {{and the larger}} house sparrow occur in the same area, the house sparrow {{generally}} breeds in urban areas while the smaller Eurasian tree sparrow nests in the countryside. Where trees <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>short</b> <b>supply,</b> as in Mongolia, both species may utilise man-made structures as nest sites. The Eurasian tree sparrow is rural in Europe, but is an urban bird in eastern Asia; in southern and central Asia, both Passer species may be found around towns and villages. In parts of the Mediterranean, such as Italy, both the tree and the Italian or Spanish sparrows {{may be found in}} settlements. In Australia, the Eurasian tree sparrow is largely an urban bird, and it is the house sparrow which utilises more natural habitats.|$|E

25|$|Badges {{with both}} {{leaders have been}} {{recently}} used by people traveling between regions as an item for bartering in the North Korean grey market. Previously, methamphetamine was used for bartering before various crackdowns made the practice hard. Badges eventually replaced drugs despite falling prices. In Pyongyang, too, where money and prized items <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>short</b> <b>supply,</b> the badges have value. This makes them a target for pickpockets. Criminals, who are often wealthier than ordinary North Koreans, usually choose to wear the expensive types of badges as status symbols.|$|E

An estimated 1.9 percent of the adult and children population was afflicted with HIV/AIDS that year, among the lowest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa. An estimated 85–91 percent of Mali's girls and women have had female genital mutilation (2006 and 2001 data).|$|E

25|$|Water resources, {{which are}} {{unevenly}} distributed, <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> {{in most of}} Uzbekistan. The vast plains that occupy two-thirds of Uzbekistan's territory have little water, and there are few lakes. The two largest rivers feeding Uzbekistan are the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, which originate {{in the mountains of}} Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, respectively. These rivers form the two main river basins of Central Asia; they are used primarily for irrigation, and several artificial canals have been built to expand the supply of arable land in the Fergana Valley and elsewhere. During the Soviet Era, a plan was devised in which Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan provided water from these two rivers to Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in summer, and these three countries provided Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan with oil and gas during the winter in return. However, this system dissolved {{after the collapse of the}} USSR, and a new resource-sharing plan has yet to be put in place. According to the International Crisis Group, this situation could lead to irreparable regional destabilization if it is not resolved. A shallow lake, Sarygamysh Lake, sits on the border with Turkmenistan.|$|E
25|$|The {{constraints}} adopted have definite implications on {{the stories}} told. An Earthman may {{fall in love}} with and wed an alien princess like Burroughs' John Carter of Mars does, but unlike Carter {{will never be able to}} found a dynasty. Nor will he be able to flit from Earth to the stars and back; an interstellar voyage takes months of subjective time and many years in objective time - as dictated by the time dilation of the Theory of relativity - rendering any decision to leave his own stellar system a difficult one, fraught with the consequences of being cut off from his friends, family and native culture for decades, during which they will age or develop much more than he will himself. De Camp somewhat mitigates the problem by postulating the development of longevity treatments that extend human lifespans to two centuries. Nonetheless, the effect is that space travel primarily attracts marginal and unattached members of society such as adventurers, entrepreneurs, con-men, utopian idealists, emigrants, and various admixtures thereof – or official representatives such as explorers, diplomats, and bureaucrats.

While looking through Peter's papers, Hartman realizes that Peter has not had a prostate exam. Peter agrees to get one, despite not knowing what it involves. Upon receiving the procedure, Peter feels sexually violated and proceeds to tell Lois about his ordeal, and she is rather unsupportive and finds it amusing, up to the point to calling him a [...] "fucking idiot".

500|$|The most {{important}} pigments that determine plumage coloration in birds are melanines and carotenoids. [...] The latter are ingested {{in food and}} transformed into colour pigments by enzymes. [...] Aberrations in this pigmentation are mostly caused by food deficiencies and usually {{do not have a}} genetic basis. Well-known examples are flamingos, which owe their distinct pink colour to the presence of red carotenoids in their natural food. When these carotenoids <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>short</b> <b>supply,</b> these birds appear white after the next moult. [...] Mutations causing changes in carotenoid-based colour pigments are rare; melanine mutations occur much more frequently. [...] Two types of melanin, eumelanin and phaeomelanin, are present in birds. In the skin and eyes, only eumelanin is present. [...] In some bird species, the colour is completely caused by eumelanin, however, both types of melanin are found in most species. [...] In birds, albinism has been defined as [...] "a total lack of both melanins in feathers, eyes and skin {{as a result of an}} inherited absence of tyrosinase", however, this ignores the effects of other pigments and structural colours.|$|E

Since a conventional speaker is constructed {{much like a}} dynamic microphone (with a diaphragm, coil and magnet), speakers can actually work [...] "in reverse" [...] as microphones. The resulting signal typically offers reduced quality including limited high-end frequency response and poor sensitivity.
