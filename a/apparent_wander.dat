40|$|A {{detailed}} magnetostratigraphic and rock-magnetism {{study of}} two Late Palaeozoic rhythmite exposures (Itu and Rio do Sul) from the Itarare Group (Parana Basin, Brazil) {{is presented in}} this paper. After stepwise alterning-field procedures and thermal cleaning were performed, samples from both collections show reversed characteristic magnetization components, which is expected for Late Palaeozoic rocks. However, the Itu rocks presented an odd, flat inclination pattern {{that could not be}} corrected with mathematical methods based on the virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) distributions. Correlation tests between the maximum anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility axis (K 1) and the magnetic declination indicated a possible mechanical influence on the remanence acquisition. The Rio do Sul sequence displayed medium to high inclinations and provided a high-quality palaeomagnetic pole (after shallowing corrections of f = 0. 8) of 347. 5 degrees E 63. 2 degrees S (N = 119; A 95 = 3. 3; K = 31), which is in accordance with the Palaeozoic <b>apparent</b> <b>wander</b> pole path of South America. The angular dispersion (Sb) for the distribution of the VGPs calculated on the basis of both the 45 degrees cut-off angle and Vandamme method was compared to the best-fit Model G for mid-latitudes. Both of the Sb results are in reasonable agreement with the predicted (palaeo) latitudinal S-? relationship during the Cretaceous Normal Superchron (CNS), although the Sb value after the Vandamme cut-off has been applied is a little lower than expected. This result, in addition to those for low palaeolatitudes during the Permo-Carboniferous Reversed Superchron (PCRS) previously reported, indicates that the low secular variation regime for the geodynamo that has already been discovered in the CNS might have also been predominant during the PCRS.

Palaeo-magnetic poles and plate rotations previously used to determine an <b>apparent</b> polar <b>wander</b> path for the hotspot reference frame are here used to determine an <b>apparent</b> polar <b>wander</b> path in the mean-lithosphere reference frame. We find that the two paths are similar, especially for Late Cretaceous time, when a 10 "- 20 " shift of the pole occurred. To first-order the hotspots and litho-sphere (as a whole) moved in unison relative to the palaeomagnetic axis during Late Cretaceous time. A non-dipole field explanation for the apparent shift can probably be excluded. However, either motion of the time-averaged geomagnetic axis relative to the spin axis or polar wandering could have caused this shift, the latter being the more likely explanation.

Restoring the strata to the palaeohorizontal yielded positive fold tests for both units at 99 per cent confidence, indicating that acquisition of magnetization occurred before the early Palaeozoic Delamerian Orogeny. For the Brachina Formation (N = 91 specimens) the mean direction after unfolding is declination D = 178. 2 ◦, inclination I = – 22. 6 ◦ (α 95 = 4. 4 ◦), indicating a palaeolatitude λ = 11. 8 ± 2. 5 ◦ and a pole position at latitude λp = 46. 0 ◦S, longitude ϕp = 315. 4 ◦E, with confidence semi-axes dp = 2. 4 ◦ and dm = 4. 6 ◦. The mean direction for the Wonoka Formation after unfolding (N = 70) is D = 255. 9 ◦, I = – 23. 7 ◦ (α 95 = 6. 4 ◦), indicating λ = 12. 3 + 3. 8 /– 3. 4 ◦ and a pole position at latitude λp = 5. 2 ◦S, longitude ϕp = 30. 5 ◦E (dp = 3. 6 ◦ and dm = 6. 8 ◦). The mean directions for these units and other Ediacaran units in the Adelaide Geosyncline are significantly different from each other, which excludes blanket remagnetization of the units before Delamerian folding and therefore gives strong preference to their magnetization dating from close {{to the time of}} deposition. The late Cryogenian–Ediacaran–Cambrian <b>apparent</b> polar <b>wander</b> path for South Australia spans 150 Myr from ∼ 635 to 490 Ma and places Australia in low palaeolatitudes throughout the interval studied. The poles differ significantly from each other, suggesting Australia underwent continual drift during that time. Whereas the directional difference between the late Cryogenian Elatina Formation and early Ediacaran Nuccaleena Formation is mainly in inclination, for most other contiguous stratigraphic units the differences are mainly in declination with minor inclination differences, indicating Australia was rotating about a nearby Euler pole in low palaeolatitudes.

High unblocking temperature, moderate to high coercivity magnetizations of normal polarity have been isolated in three plutons (White Mountains batholith, Mount Monadnock, and the Belknap Mountains; mean age ~ 169 Ma), but the mean pole (88. 4 °N, 82. 1 °E, A 95 = 6. 1 °) is not distinguishable from the geographic axis {{and therefore the}} hypothesis that the plutons have been contaminated by recent field overprints can not be rejected. However, a dual polarity, high unblocking temperature, and high coercivity magnetization isolated from the Moat volcanics (169 Ma, Rb-Sr age) was apparently acquired soon after caldera collapse and tilting, at about the time of intrusion and cooling of the Conway granite (reported ages K-Ar biotite, 168 Ma; zircon fission track, 163 Ma). The Moat volcanics pole position (78. 7 °N, 90. 3 °E, dp = 7. 1 °, dm = 10. 2 °) calculated using the mean magnetization direction of reversed polarity (the Cr component) falls at high latitude but is distinguishable from the spin axis. Moreover, published Middle Jurassic paleomagnetic poles from Gondwana (Africa, Australia, and East Antarctica) transferred to the North American reference frame also suggest a high-latitude Middle Jurassic pole position for North America, in agreement with the Moat volcanics pole. The new evidence for a Middle Jurassic loop to high latitudes in the North American <b>apparent</b> polar <b>wander</b> path conflicts by 15 °- 20 ° with some key published Jurassic reference poles (e. g., the Newark Trend N 2 and the Corral Canyon poles) used to constrain current paleomagnetic Euler pole (PEP) <b>apparent</b> polar <b>wander</b> paths for the Jurassic.

A total of 24 samples from 4 sites was collected. Progressive thermal demagnetization isolated single characteristic component magnetizations from 21 samples. The samples show mixed, but dominantly normal polarities. The mean direction is 46 / 23 (in-situ) and 53 / 11 (tilt-corrected), yielding a pole position of 34 N, 208 E. IRM acquisition experiments suggest that the magnetizations are carried by magnetite. SEM images of polished thin-sections show that the magnetite has replaced pyrite, indicating a secondary (diagenetic) origin for the magnetite. Considering the dominant normal polarity and by comparison with paleomagnetic results of Permian and younger ages for South China, we infer that these Upper Permian limestones in Guizhou province have been remagnetized during the latest Permian or Early Triassic. A review of the paleomagnetic data reported thus far for the Emeishan Basalts in different localities shows that the results from these Upper Permian rocks in general fall into three groups: one group (A) resembles the mean characteristic direction of our limestones; the second group (B) has yielded directions in agreement {{with those of the}} Triassic; and the third group (C) conforms to the directions obtained from the Late Triassic/Jurassic remagnetization data in some Paleozoic and Triassic rocks of South China.
