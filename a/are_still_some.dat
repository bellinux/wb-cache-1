5|$|There {{is also a}} {{sizeable}} Filipino population in the city. The first wave of migrants arrived in the late 15th century during the Spanish colonisation, while a later wave arrived in the early 1970s, driven away from the Philippines by political and economic uncertainties there. Most of the earlier migrants have been naturalised as Malaysian citizens. However, there <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>some</b> Filipinos {{living in the city}} without proper documentation as illegal immigrants. Most of the Filipino migrants are Tausūgs (Suluk) coming from the southern parts of Philippines. The city also is home to immigrants from Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{one can see}} Gaelic {{written on}} the walls of the parish church, but the {{language}} has effectively died out, and English is totally dominant. Nevertheless, there <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>some</b> 72 residents (4.3%) of the village who know the language. The village is also a big location on the Highland folk-circuit, and enjoys a vibrant musical culture in the Gaelic tradition. It is a regular practice for local musicians to meet in the Balconie Inn, one of the two licensed establishments of the town, and engage in evening-long sessions. Many prominent musicians on the Celtic music scene have visited, including Eilidh Steel and Dougie MacLean.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many archaeological finds, {{the human}} {{remains at the}} site were able to be dated with environmental, geological, and archaeological methods. Human remains at the site are the oldest {{that have been found}} in Washington, and at the time were the oldest set of remains found in North America. Later {{radiocarbon}} work has confirmed the original dating of this site, indicating that these human remains, albeit very fragmentary, <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>some</b> of the oldest ever excavated in the New World. This finding was useful in confirming the early chronology of the region and confirming the antiquity of the styles of associated bone tools.|$|E
5|$|The {{observed}} {{relationship between}} the luminosity of the hydroxyl line and the far infrared suggests that hydroxyl megamasers are radiatively pumped. Initial VLBI measurements of nearby hydroxyl megamasers seemed to present {{a problem with this}} model for compact emission components of hydroxyl megamasers, as they required a very high fraction of infrared photons to be absorbed by hydroxyl and lead to a maser photon being emitted, making collisional excitation a more plausible pumping mechanism. However, a model of maser emission with a clumpy masing medium appear to be able to reproduce the observed properties of compact and diffuse hydroxyl emission. A recent detailed treatment finds that photons with a wavelength of 53 micrometres are the primary pump for main line maser emission, and applies to all hydroxyl masers. In order to provide enough photons at this wavelength, the interstellar dust that reprocesses stellar radiation to infrared wavelengths must have a temperature of at least 45 kelvins. Recent observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope confirm this basic picture, but there <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>some</b> discrepancies between details of the model and observations of hydroxyl megamaser host galaxies such as the required dust opacity for megamaser emission.|$|E

25|$|The German wine {{regions are}} some of the most northerly in the world. The main wine-producing climate lies below the 50th parallel, which runs through the regions Rheingau and Mosel.

25|$|Reasons for {{criticism}} {{of the theory of}} relativity have included alternative theories, rejection of the abstract-mathematical method, and alleged errors of the theory.
