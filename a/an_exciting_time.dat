5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>time.</b> A lot of active {{students}} wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
25|$|Ford found Avondale <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>time</b> {{for mental}} and spiritual growth. He {{was an active}} {{participant}} in class discussions, and occasionally taught classes to fill in for the lecturers. He was particularly inspired by Dr. William Murdoch, and carried out research for him. Ford gave talks in nearby churches, and published around a dozen articles for church magazines during this time. He also led students in Bible study. He struggled financially, and worked on Avondale's farm and elsewhere, and also selling Adventist books.|$|E
25|$|Expiry (or Expiration in the U.S.) is {{the time}} and the day that a {{particular}} delivery month of a futures contract stops trading, as well as the final settlement price for that contract. For many equity index and Interest rate future contracts (as well as for most equity options), this happens on the third Friday of certain trading months. On this day the t+1 futures contract becomes the t futures contract. For example, for most CME and CBOT contracts, at the expiration of the December contract, the March futures become the nearest contract. This is <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>time</b> for arbitrage desks, which try to make quick profits during the short period (perhaps 30 minutes) during which the underlying cash price and the futures price sometimes struggle to converge. At this moment the futures and the underlying assets are extremely liquid and any disparity between an index and an underlying asset is quickly traded by arbitrageurs. At this moment also, the increase in volume is caused by traders rolling over positions to the next contract or, in the case of equity index futures, purchasing underlying components of those indexes to hedge against current index positions. On the expiry date, a European equity arbitrage trading desk in London or Frankfurt will see positions expire in as many as eight major markets almost every half an hour.|$|E

The Mayor, Rob Drew, believed the centre development should be <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>time</b> for Port Macquarie and was critical of opposition to the project, characterising it as [...] "slanderous accusations" [...] and [...] "fomenting discontent". He acknowledged the report raised concerns about the processes behind the project, but insisted the project itself was sound, saying in a press release, [...] "I for one make no apologies {{that this is a}} multi-purpose facility which will provide for performers, community groups, which will provide for conferences, seminars and meetings, which will provide for activities never seen before in Port Macquarie." [...] Harrison meanwhile told ABC News, [...] "The report has said categorically that [...] Council has lied to the community about the cost of the arts centre at every opportunity it's had and it's put a gloss or a spin on it".|$|E

2500|$|After it was {{confirmed}} that Taylforth {{was returning to}} EastEnders, executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins teased about Gavin in May 2015 when he said of Kathy's return: [...] "It's a big, big story with lots of twists and turns. We know that there was a man named Gavin, who Kathy went off with to South Africa. So there's Gavin, Kathy—and lots of Phil [...] involved." [...] Then, on 17 June, Treadwell-Collins posted on Twitter a photo of part of a script, featuring Gavin, and the caption [...] "He's on his way...". The following day, 18 June, Paul Nicholas's casting in the role was announced, and it {{was confirmed}} that the character would play a major part in Kathy's return storyline. Nicholas said of his role: [...] "I am delighted to be joining the wonderful cast of EastEnders for {{what is going to be}} <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>time</b> ahead. I can't wait to get started and seeing what's in store for my character." [...] Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "We are all thrilled that Paul has agreed to join our cast to play Gavin. So many British television viewers have grown up with Paul Nicholas so it's brilliant to have him back on our screens, playing a major part in Kathy's explosive return to the Square, while also holding the key to many more of the Square's secrets." [...] Nicholas later said it was [...] "great" [...] for him to join a [...] "brilliantly produced and very well acted" [...] show, but said it was [...] "quite daunting" [...] as he had not acted in a soap opera before. He said that when he joined the cast, he met the writers who explained the character to him and gave him a [...] "really good insight into where they wanted it to go" [...] and added, [...] "It is nice to be involved in something so successful and that people actually watch." [...] Two days after Nicholas's casting was announced, Nicholas and Taylforth were seen filming on location at King's Cross station, for Gavin's introduction scene that aired on 21 August 2015, and on 30 June, on-location photos emerged of Nicholas, Taylforth, Steve McFadden (Phil Mitchell) and Samantha Womack (Ronnie Mitchell), filming at an airfield in Essex, for Gavin's third episode, broadcast on 11 September 2015.|$|E

Felicity remarked scornfully that she would have thought the Story Girl would get tired wearing red so much, and even Cecily commented apart to me that she thought when you got so many things all at once you didn't appreciate them as much as when you only got a few.|$|E
