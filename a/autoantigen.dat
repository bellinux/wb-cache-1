25|$|There {{are ways}} in which {{autoimmunity}} caused by molecular mimicry can be avoided. Control of the initiating factor (pathogen) via vaccination {{seems to be the}} most common method to avoid autoimmunity. Inducing tolerance to the host <b>autoantigen</b> in this way may also be the most stable factor. The development of a downregulating immune response to the shared epitope between pathogen and host may be the best way of treating an autoimmune disease caused by molecular mimicry. Alternatively, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs such as ciclosporin and azathioprine has also been used as a possible solution. However, in many cases this {{has been shown to be}} ineffective because cells and tissues have already been destroyed at the onset of the infection.|$|E
25|$|THαβ {{helper cells}} provide the host {{immunity}} against viruses. Their differentiation is triggered by IFN α/β or IL-10. Their key effector cytokine is IL-10. Their main effector cells are NK cells {{as well as}} CD8 T cells, IgG B cells, and IL-10 CD4 T cells. The key THαβ transcription factors are STAT1 and STAT3 as well as IRFs. IL-10 from CD4 T cells activate NK cells' ADCC to apoptose virus-infected cells and to induce host as well as viral DNA fragmentation. IFN alpha/beta can suppress transcription to avoid virus replication and transmission. Overactivation of THαβ against <b>autoantigen</b> will cause type 2 antibody-dependent cytotoxic hypersensitivity. Myasthenia gravis or Graves' disease belong to this category.|$|E

Protein arrays enable profiling of the specificity of autoantibody responses against panels of peptides and proteins representing known <b>autoantigens</b> as well as candidate <b>autoantigens.</b> In addition to identifying <b>autoantigens</b> and mapping immunodominant epitopes, proteomic analysis of autoantibody responses will further enable diagnosis, prognosis, and tailoring of antigen-specific tolerizing therapy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Autoimmune {{diseases}} are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by immune reactions against either a major or {{a limited number}} of the bodies own <b>autoantigens,</b> causing inflammation and damage to tissues and organs. Thus, identification of <b>autoantigens</b> is an important first step to understanding autoimmune diseases. Here we demonstrate a simple screening method for identification of <b>autoantigens</b> reacting with patient serum antibodies by combination of an N-terminal bioti-nylated protein library (BPL), produced using a wheat cell-free protein production system, and a commercially available luminescence system. Optimization studies us-ing well-characterized <b>autoantigens</b> showed specific in-teractions between N-terminal biotinylated proteins and antibody that were sensitively detected under homoge...|$|R
40|$|Vasectomy was {{performed}} on inbred Lewis rats to induce anti-sperm autoantibodies and to identify their cognate <b>autoantigens.</b> Different detergent extracts of cauda epididymal spermatozoa were separated by sodi-um dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with sera from pre-vasectomy, post-vasectomy, and hyperimmunized animals to detect isologous sperm an-tigens. Nonreduced SDS-soluble <b>autoantigens</b> at> 200, 86, 43, and 26 kDa were bound by post-vasectomy antisera. Reduction of SDS-soluble antigens resulted in increased staining of the 86, 72 - 63, and 43 kDa auto-antigens. Laemmli extraction of SDS insoluble pellets with 13 -mercaptoethanol generated the largest repertoire of <b>autoantigens</b> including several <b>autoantigens</b> found in SDS-soluble extracts. Therefore, to analyze the entire repertoire of post-vasectomy <b>autoantigens,</b> whole sperm were extracted with Laemmli buffer under reducing conditions. Autoantiserum from most vasectomized animals bound Laemmli-extracted reduced <b>autoantigens</b> of approximately 86 (89 - 78), 63, 43, and 20 (21 - 16) kDa. Testicular extracts, reduced and separated by SDS-PA GE, contained <b>autoantigens</b> of 76, 60, and 42 kDa that were also recognized by hyperimmune and post-vasectomy antisera. The repertoire of sperm antigens recognized by pooled serum from hyperimmunized animals {{was similar to the}} cumulative repertoire recognized by post-vasectomy sera. These studies define several major sperm autoimmunogens recognized by post-vasectomy antisera and indicate that many of these pep tide auto-immunogens are disulfide-bonded complexes...|$|R
25|$|Prediction and {{validation}} of the immunodominant epitope/s of HSP90 beta protein has been demonstrated using sera from infertile women having anti-HSP90 autoantibodies. The decapeptide EP6 (380-389)is a major immunogenic epitope of HSP90 followed by EP1 (1-12) and EP8 (488-498). Knowledge of binding epitopes on the <b>autoantigen</b> is necessary to understand the subsequent pathologic events. Predicted 3D structures of these peptides demonstrated that they exist in the loop conformation, {{which is the most}} mobile part of the protein. Also, analysis of the sequences of HSP90 beta across several species reveals that EP6 peptide forms a part of a well-conserved motif. A polyclonal antibody generated to the immunodominant epitope- EP6 confirms similar biochemical and cellular immunoreactivity as seen with the patients' sera with anti-HSP90 autoantibodies. The study might generate new tools for the detection of disease-inducing epitopes and a possible therapeutic intervention.|$|E
25|$|Patients with SPS {{generally}} have high amounts of high {{glutamic acid decarboxylase}} antibody titers. About 80 percent of SPS patients have GAD antibodies, compared with about {{one percent of the}} general population. The overwhelming majority of people who have GAD antibodies do not contract SPS, indicating that systematic synthesis of the antibody is not the sole cause of SPS. GAD, a presynaptic <b>autoantigen,</b> is generally thought to {{play a key role in}} the condition, but exact details of the way that autoantibodies affect SPS patients are not known. Most SPS patients with high-titer GAD antibodies also have antibodies that inhibit GABA-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP). Autoantibodies against amphiphysin and gephyrin are also sometimes found in SPS patients. The antibodies appear to interact with antigens in the brain neurons and the spinal cord synapses, causing a functional blockade with gamma-aminobutyric acid. This leads to GABA impairment, which probably causes the stiffness and spasms that characterizes SPS. There are low GABA levels in the motor cortexes of SPS patients.|$|E

40|$|Autoantibodies against {{integral}} membrane proteins {{are usually}} pathogenic. Although anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECAs) {{are considered to}} be critical, especially for vascular lesions in collagen diseases, most molecules identified as <b>autoantigens</b> for AECAs are localized within the cell and not expressed on the cell surface. For identification of <b>autoantigens,</b> proteomics and expression library analyses have been performed for many years with some success. To specifically target cell-surface molecules in identification of <b>autoantigens,</b> we constructed a serological identification system for <b>autoantigens</b> using a retroviral vector and flow cytometry (SARF). Here, we present an overview of recent research in AECAs and their target molecules and discuss the principle and the application of SARF. Using SARF, we successfully identified three different membrane proteins: fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein 2 (FLRT 2) from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1) from a patient with rheumatoid arthritis, and Pk (Gb 3 /CD 77) from an SLE patient with hemolytic anemia, as targets for AECAs. SARF is useful for specific identification of <b>autoantigens</b> expressed on the cell surface, and identification of such interactions of the cell-surface <b>autoantigens</b> and pathogenic autoantibodies may enable the development of more specific intervention strategies in autoimmune diseases...|$|R
40|$|Autoantibodies against {{particular}} nuclear components, such as chromatin and snRNPs, are {{a characteristic}} {{feature of the}} autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus. The last decade, evidence has suggested that apoptotic cells are {{the main source of}} <b>autoantigens</b> in this disease. Therefore, it has been proposed that protein modifications occurring during apoptosis lead to the formation of neo-epitopes, which can break the tolerance when apoptotic cells are not properly cleared. Indeed, many lupus <b>autoantigens</b> are prone to apoptosis-associated post-translational modifications and/or cleavage by caspases. In addition, lupus <b>autoantigens</b> are relocated from the nucleus to apoptotic blebs on the cell surface of early apoptotic cells. Therefore, to understand why certain nuclear proteins become <b>autoantigens</b> during apoptosis, {{it is important to know}} the apoptotic processing of these proteins. This review summarizes the current knowledge of apoptotic processing of lupus <b>autoantigens</b> and the possible effects on their encounter with the immune system in normal and autoimmune situations...|$|R

2500|$|Th2 {{helper cells}} are the host {{immunity}} effectors against extracellular [...] parasites including helminths. They are triggered by IL-4 and IL-12, and their effector cytokines are IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10 and IL-13. The main effector cells are eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells {{as well as}} B cells, and IL-4/IL-5 CD4 T cells. The key Th2 transcription factors are STAT6 and GATA3. IL-4 is the positive feedback cytokine for Th2 cells differentiation. Besides, IL-4 stimulates B-cells to produce IgE antibodies, which in turn stimulate mast cells to release histamine, serotonin, and leukotriene to cause broncho-constriction, intestinal peristalsis, gastric fluid acidification to expel helminths. IL-5 from CD4 T cells will activate eosinophils to attack helminths. IL-10 suppresses Th1 cells differentiation and function of dendritic cells. [...] Th2 overactivation against <b>autoantigen</b> will cause Type1 IgE-mediated allergy and hypersensitivity. Allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma belong to this category of autoimmunity. [...] In addition to expressing different cytokines, Th2 cells also differ from Th1 cells in their cell surface glycans (oligosaccharides), which makes them less susceptible to some inducers of cell death.|$|E
40|$|To {{search for}} <b>autoantigens</b> in psoriatic plaques, we {{screened}} cDNA libraries of plaque epidermis with psoriatic serum samples. This {{approach has been}} highly successful in identifying tumor antigens, but has not been widely applied to autoimmune disease. We identified 11 <b>autoantigens</b> including three with prominent reactivity and plausible disease relevance. These are keratin 13 (K 13), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein-A 1 (hnRNP-A 1), and a previously uncharacterized protein, FLJ 00294. Serum antibody screening for these demonstrated reactivity in 40 %, 38 %, and 27 % of psoriasis patients, respectively. Most positive samples reacted with all three, {{and we found that}} this was due to cross-reactivity among them. Enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) analysis of psoriatic peripheral blood T cells confirmed that these <b>autoantigens</b> are also recognized by T cells. This demonstrates that this is a feasible method to identify <b>autoantigens</b> in an autoimmune target tissue, and suggests that these antigens warrant further study in psoriasis. Furthermore, but peripheral blood of normal controls reacted to these <b>autoantigens</b> with essentially the same frequencies as patients, suggesting that psoriatics may have not only an immune system which is capable of reacting to certain <b>autoantigens,</b> but also to a skin immunoregulatory alteration which allows this normal reactivity to develop into abnormal inflammation...|$|R

40|$|Recently, autoantibodies to some citrullinated <b>autoantigens</b> {{have been}} {{reported}} to be specific for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, an entire profile of and autoimmunity of the citrullinated proteins have been poorly understood. To understand the profile, we examined citrullinated <b>autoantigens</b> by a proteomic approach and further investigated the significance of citrullination in antigenicity of one of the <b>autoantigens.</b> Specifically, we detected citrullinated <b>autoantigens</b> in synovial tissue of a patient with RA by two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blotting by using pooled sera from five patients with RA and anti-citrulline antibodies. After identifying the detected <b>autoantigens</b> by mass spectrometry, we investigated the contribution of citrullination to autoantigenicity by using a recombinant protein with or without citrullination on one of the identified novel citrullinated <b>autoantigens.</b> As a result, we found 51 citrullinated protein spots. Thirty (58. 8 %) of these spots were autoantigenic. We identified 13 out of the 30 detected citrullinated autoantigenic proteins. They contained three fibrinogen derivatives and several novel citrullinated <b>autoantigens</b> (for example, asporin and F-actin capping protein α- 1 subunit [CapZα- 1]). We further analyzed the contribution of citrullination to autoantigenicity in one of the detected citrullinated <b>autoantigens,</b> CapZα- 1. As a result, frequencies of autoantibodies to non-citrullinated CapZα- 1 were 36. 7 % in the RA group tested, 10. 7 % in the osteoarthritis (OA) group, and 6. 5 % in healthy donors. On the other hand, those to citrullinated CapZα- 1 were 53. 3 % in the RA group, 7. 1 % in the OA group, and 6. 5 % in the healthy donors. This shows that autoantigenicity of citrullinated or non-citrullinated CapZα- 1 is relevant to RA. The antibody titers to the citrullinated CapZα- 1 were significantly higher than those to the non-citrullinated CapZα- 1 in 36. 7 % of patients; however, the other patients showed almost equal antibody titers to both citrullinated and non-citrullinated CapZα- 1. Therefore, the autoantibodies would target citrulline-related and/or citrulline-unrelated epitope(s) of CapZα- 1. In conclusion, we report a profile of citrullinated <b>autoantigens</b> for the first time. Even though citrullination is closely related to autoantigenicity, citrullination would not always produce autoantigenicity in RA. Citrullinated and non-citrullinated autoantigens/autoepitopes would have different pathological roles in RA...|$|R
