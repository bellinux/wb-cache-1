25|$|On August 2, 2016, it's been {{revealed}} that the proposed project of constructing a combined expanded convention center attached to an arena and hotel has been revived and that a $1 million feasibility study for a combined arena, hotel and expanded convention center was requested by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake from the Maryland Stadium Authority and that the Maryland Stadium Authority has <b>approved</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> Funding {{is coming from the}} Maryland Stadium Authority ($126,667), the State of Maryland (an additional $500,000 is available immediately to fund this study), the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore ($30,000), the Greater Baltimore Committee ($30,000), and the City of Baltimore ($313,333). The study will take approximately a year to complete and is expected to be completed and released in Fall 2017. The study will look at having either just a convention center expansion and having a combined expanded convention center attached to a new arena and hotel, the study will look at the environmental, community and traffic impacts of the two proposals and what types of events the new facility will be able to attract, this study will also determine exactly how large the expanded convention center is supposed to be. The new complex will be bounded by Pratt, Charles and Conway Streets. This study will not include construction and budget plans as this is just phase 1, if the state and city elects to move forward after reviewing the results of this study, that second study will put together just partial plans to obtain a cost estimate.|$|E
2500|$|A survey {{conducted}} by Pew Research Center in January 2016 found that 63% of Americans approved of Obama's decision to re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba, while 28% disapproved. The study found that Democrats (74%) and Independents (67%) {{were more likely to}} support the re-established relations; 40% of Republicans <b>approved.</b> <b>The</b> <b>study</b> also found that 66% of Americans supported ending the trade embargo against Cuba, while 28% disapproved. Support for both the re-establishment of relations and the lifting of the trade embargo was seen broadly amongst all racial and ethnic groups (62% of whites, 64% of blacks, and 65% of Hispanics) and amongst all age-brackets, however younger Americans were more likely to support it than older Americans. Americans who were college or university graduates (77%) overwhelmingly supported the restoration of relations, while people with only some college education (59%) or only high school education (53%) were less likely to support it. Despite broad support for the re-establishment of diplomatic relations {{and the end of the}} trade embargo, only 32% of Americans surveyed believed that Cuba would become [...] "more democratic" [...] over the next several years, with 60% believing the situation in Cuba will remain the same.|$|E
2500|$|Their use has {{continued}} {{since the end}} of the Cold War in Georgia and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe. The first regulated, randomized, double-blind clinical trial was reported in the Journal of Wound Care in June 2009, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of a bacteriophage cocktail to treat infected venous leg ulcers in human patients. The FDA <b>approved</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> as a Phase I clinical trial. The study's results demonstrated the safety of therapeutic application of bacteriophages but did not show efficacy. The authors explain that the use of certain chemicals that are part of standard wound care (e.g. lactoferrin or silver) may have interfered with bacteriophage viability. Another controlled clinical trial in Western Europe (treatment of ear infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was reported shortly after in the journal Clinical Otolaryngology in August 2009. The study concludes that bacteriophage preparations were safe and effective for treatment of chronic ear infections in humans. Additionally, there have been numerous animal and other experimental clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of bacteriophages for various diseases, such as infected burns and wounds, and cystic fibrosis associated lung infections, among others. Meanwhile, bacteriophage researchers are developing engineered viruses to overcome antibiotic resistance, and engineering the phage genes responsible for coding enzymes which degrade the biofilm matrix, phage structural proteins and also enzymes responsible for lysis of bacterial cell wall. There have been results showing that T4 phages that are small in size and short-tailed can be helpful in detecting E.coli [...] in the human body.|$|E

50|$|In May 1970, a ministerial {{dispatch}} <b>approved</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> into {{moving the}} fountain from {{eastern part of}} the Praça da República to the northeast corner of the square.

The project presupposed a garden and landscaping of the space, limited to the corners and public access pavement. Finding that the location of the staircase would create difficulties, the DGEMN decided to solicit the municipal government technicians in order to conclude the project.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept for}} a new study {{originated}} by a CALGB member is discussed by the Disease Committee and Modality Committee core; it is then discussed by the full committee. The committee chairs bring the concept to the Executive Committee and, if <b>approved,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Study</b> Chair develops a draft protocol. The relevant Committee Chair, the responsible Statistician, appropriate chairs of other Disease and Modality committees, patient advocates, and the Principal Investigators at the main member institutions {{are involved in the}} protocol design. After CALGB review and NCI approval, the Central Office officially activates the protocol. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) periodically reviews interim reports prepared by the Statistical Center for all Phase III studies. When the required number of patients has been entered on a study, the study is closed. The DSMB may elect to terminate a protocol early or to continue a study beyond its intended accrual.

5000|$|In 2002, a {{group of}} five Port St. John {{residents}} formed [...] "Port St. John For Tomorrow" [...] (PSJ4T) and tried to incorporate the Port St. John area. Included in PSJ4T's incorporation plans were five separate communities: Delespine, Williams Point, Hardeeville, Frontenac {{and a part of}} Sharpes. [...] PSJ4T had not informed these five communities. When the five communities did find out, they expressed disinterest in being included in the incorporation effort. [...] A feasibility study was requested by PSJ4T members. Voters <b>approved</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> The study was funded by Brevard County and performed by the University of Central Florida. The five reviewing committees in Tallahassee said the study was [...] "deeply flawed.". The county allowed the residents of Port St. John and the five communities to vote on becoming a city. Howard Futch and Randy Ball (CS/HB 1071) sponsored the bills in the Senate and House. [...] The incorporation issue was defeated in November 2002, 73% to 27%, including {{most of the people in}} the five communities.
