5|$|This {{serves to}} {{increase}} {{the diversity of the}} antibody pool and impacts the antibody's antigen-binding affinity. Some point mutations will result in the production of <b>antibodies</b> that have a weaker interaction (low affinity) with their antigen than the original antibody, and some mutations will generate <b>antibodies</b> with a stronger interaction (high affinity). B cells that express high affinity <b>antibodies</b> on their surface will receive a strong survival signal during interactions with other cells, whereas those with low affinity <b>antibodies</b> will not, and will die by apoptosis. Thus, B cells expressing <b>antibodies</b> with a higher affinity for the antigen will outcompete those with weaker affinities for function and survival allowing the average affinity of <b>antibodies</b> to increase over time. The process of generating <b>antibodies</b> with increased binding affinities is called affinity maturation. Affinity maturation occurs in mature B cells after V(D)J recombination, and is dependent on help from helper T cells.|$|E
5|$|Various <b>antibodies</b> {{directed}} at nerve cells {{have been reported}} in Guillain–Barré syndrome. In the axonal subtype, these <b>antibodies</b> have been shown to bind to gangliosides, a group of substances found in peripheral nerves. A ganglioside is a molecule consisting of ceramide bound to a small group of hexose-type sugars and containing various numbers of N-acetylneuraminic acid groups. The key four gangliosides against which <b>antibodies</b> have been described are GM1, GD1a, GT1a, and GQ1b, with different anti-ganglioside <b>antibodies</b> being associated with particular features; for instance, GQ1b <b>antibodies</b> have been linked with Miller Fisher variant GBS and related forms including Bickerstaff encephalitis. The production of these <b>antibodies</b> after an infection is probably the result of molecular mimicry, where the immune system is reacting to microbial substances but the resultant <b>antibodies</b> also react with substances occurring naturally in the body. After a Campylobacter infection, the body produces <b>antibodies</b> of the IgA class; only a small proportion of people also produce IgG <b>antibodies</b> against bacterial substance cell wall substances (e.g. lipooligosaccharides) that crossreact with human nerve cell gangliosides. It is not currently known how this process escapes central tolerance to gangliosides, which is meant to suppress the production of <b>antibodies</b> against the body's own substances. Not all antiganglioside <b>antibodies</b> cause disease, and it has recently been suggested that some <b>antibodies</b> bind to more than one type of epitope simultaneously (heterodimeric binding) and that this determines the response. Furthermore, the development of pathogenic <b>antibodies</b> may depend on the presence of other strains of bacteria in the bowel.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} <b>antibodies</b> {{can be called}} {{monovalent}} (or specific) if they have affinity for the same epitope, or for the same antigen (but potentially different epitopes on the molecule), or for the same strain of microorganism (but potentially different antigens on or in it). In contrast, a group of <b>antibodies</b> can be called polyvalent (or unspecific) if they have affinity for various antigens or microorganisms. Intravenous immunoglobulin, if not otherwise noted, consists of polyvalent IgG. In contrast, monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> are monovalent for the same epitope.|$|E

40|$|Suppression of anti-DNP <b>antibody</b> {{formation}} by passively administered anti-DNP <b>antibody</b> was studied quantitatively. The {{ability of}} an antiserum to suppress <b>antibody</b> formation {{was found to}} be related to the affinity of the <b>antibody</b> for the homologous antigenic determinant (ε-DNP-L-lysine), high affinity <b>antibody</b> being capable of causing suppression at far lower concentrations than low affinity <b>antibody.</b> In addition, very low concentrations of high affinity <b>antibody</b> were found to bring about enhancement of <b>antibody</b> formation.

40|$|The {{study of}} <b>antibody</b> {{responses}} in the intestine has been greatly hampered by lack of reproducible sensitive assays. An assay for measuring <b>antibody</b> against bacteria capable of regularly detecting gut <b>antibody</b> in gastroenteritis is described. It is based on absorption of <b>antibody</b> onto bacteria and measurement {{of the amount of}} <b>antibody</b> bound using radiolabelled anti-immunoglobulin <b>antibody.</b> Anti-light chain <b>antibody</b> is used to detect all classes of <b>antibody</b> as well as partially degraded <b>antibody</b> which retains the capacity to bind; anti-alpha and anti-gamma <b>antibody</b> is used to measure IgA and IgG <b>antibody.</b> The sensitivity of the assay depends on the use of anti-immunoglobulin <b>antibody</b> purified by affinity chromatography and allows measurement of nanogram amounts of <b>antibody.</b> Its specificity and kinetics are described and the particular advantages it provides in the measurement of antibacterial <b>antibody</b> in the intestine are discussed...|$|R
5|$|<b>Antibodies</b> {{are heavy}} (~150kDa) {{globular}} plasma proteins. They have sugar chains (glycans) added to conserved amino acid residues. In other words, <b>antibodies</b> are glycoproteins. The attached glycans are critically {{important to the}} structure and function of the antibody. Among other things the expressed glycans can modulate an antibody's affinity for its corresponding FcR(s).|$|E
5|$|<b>Antibodies</b> are protein {{components}} of an {{adaptive immune system}} whose main function is to bind antigens, or foreign substances in the body, and target them for destruction. <b>Antibodies</b> can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, <b>antibodies</b> have no such constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.|$|E
5|$|<b>Antibodies</b> can {{continue}} {{to be an effective}} defence mechanism even after viruses have managed to gain entry to the host cell. A protein that is in cells, called TRIM21, can attach to the <b>antibodies</b> {{on the surface of the}} virus particle. This primes the subsequent destruction of the virus by the enzymes of the cell's proteosome system.|$|E

5000|$|There are two complex {{steps in}} the {{manufacture}} of <b>antibody</b> for immunolabeling. The first is producing the <b>antibody</b> that binds specifically to the antigen of interest and the second is fusing the tag to the <b>antibody.</b> Since it is impractical to fuse a tag to every conceivable antigen-specific <b>antibody,</b> most immunolabeling processes use an indirect method of detection. This indirect method employs a primary <b>antibody</b> that is antigen-specific and a secondary <b>antibody</b> fused to a tag that specifically binds the primary <b>antibody.</b> This indirect approach permits mass production of secondary <b>antibody</b> that can be bought off the shelf. [...] Pursuant to this indirect method, the primary <b>antibody</b> is added to the test system. The primary <b>antibody</b> seeks out and binds to the target antigen.

5|$|<b>Antibodies</b> {{to certain}} types of {{chromatin}} organization, in particular, nucleosomes, {{have been associated with}} a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus.

As in the case of progeria, the role played by the <b>antibodies</b> in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious.|$|E
5|$|Antibody mimetics are organic {{compounds}} that, like <b>antibodies,</b> can specifically bind antigens. They are usually artificial peptides or proteins with a molar mass of about 3 to 20 kDa. Nucleic acids and small molecules are sometimes considered antibody mimetics, but not artificial <b>antibodies,</b> antibody fragments and fusion proteins are composed from these. Common advantages over <b>antibodies</b> are better solubility, tissue penetration, stability towards heat and enzymes, and comparatively low production costs. Antibody mimetics {{such as the}} Affimer and the DARPin have being developed and commercialised as research, diagnostic and therapeutic agents.|$|E
5|$|At the {{prenatal}} and neonatal {{stages of}} life, {{the presence of}} <b>antibodies</b> is provided by passive immunization from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of <b>antibodies,</b> and usually appear within {{the first years of}} life. Since <b>antibodies</b> exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said {{to be part of the}} humoral immune system. Circulating <b>antibodies</b> are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one antigen (an example is a virus capsid protein fragment). <b>Antibodies</b> contribute to immunity in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway. <b>Antibodies</b> will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).|$|E

40|$|After {{experimental}} {{infection with}} Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 42 % of 67 volunteers developed a threefold or greater rise in <b>antibody</b> in nasal secretions {{as measured by}} radioimmunoprecipitation.

5000|$|A direct {{fluorescent}} <b>antibody</b> (DFA or dFA), {{also known}} as [...] "direct immunofluorescence", is an <b>antibody</b> that has been tagged in a direct fluorescent <b>antibody</b> test. Its name derives {{from the fact that}} it directly tests the presence of an antigen with the tagged <b>antibody,</b> unlike western blotting, which uses an indirect method of detection, where the primary <b>antibody</b> binds the target antigen, with a secondary <b>antibody</b> directed against the primary, and a tag attached to the secondary <b>antibody.</b>|$|R
5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{can often}} be traced to <b>antibodies</b> that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through blood tests. <b>Antibodies</b> directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test.

5|$|Each {{heavy chain}} has two regions, the {{constant}} {{region and the}} variable region. The constant region is identical in all <b>antibodies</b> of the same isotype, but differs in <b>antibodies</b> of different isotypes. Heavy chains γ, α and δ have a constant region composed of three tandem (in a line) Ig domains, and a hinge region for added flexibility; heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of four immunoglobulin domains. The variable region of the heavy chain differs in <b>antibodies</b> produced by different B cells, but {{is the same for}} all <b>antibodies</b> produced by a single B cell or B cell clone. The variable region of each heavy chain is approximately 110 amino acids long and is composed of a single Ig domain.|$|E
5|$|Heparin occurs {{naturally}} {{in the human}} body, but the development of HIT <b>antibodies</b> suggests heparin may act as a hapten, and thus be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms <b>antibodies</b> against heparin when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These <b>antibodies</b> are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, {{those who have been}} exposed to heparin {{in the last few months}} may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type <b>antibodies</b> generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months. HIT <b>antibodies</b> have been found in individuals with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to heparin, but the majority are found in people who are receiving heparin.|$|E
5|$|In research, {{purified}} <b>antibodies</b> {{are used}} in many applications. <b>Antibodies</b> for research applications can be found directly from antibody suppliers, or through use of a specialist search engine. Research <b>antibodies</b> are most commonly used to identify and locate intracellular and extracellular proteins. <b>Antibodies</b> {{are used in}} flow cytometry to differentiate cell types by the proteins they express; different types of cell express different combinations of cluster of differentiation molecules on their surface, and produce different intracellular and secretable proteins. They are also used in immunoprecipitation to separate proteins and anything bound to them (co-immunoprecipitation) from other molecules in a cell lysate, in Western blot analyses to identify proteins separated by electrophoresis, and in immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence to examine protein expression in tissue sections or to locate proteins within cells {{with the assistance of}} a microscope.

40|$|The defined antigen {{substrate}} spheres (DASS) {{system was}} employed for analysing reactions between solid state <b>antibody</b> or antigen and soluble immune complexes.

Binding of soluble complexes to the beads was measured by fluorimetry and/or radiometry of fluorescein or 125 -I-labelled ovalbumin or <b>antibody.</b> Antigen-antibody complexes in <b>antibody</b> excess bound less effectively to the <b>antibody</b> beads than antigen alone, but complexes in slight or moderate antigen excess bound more effectively. Complexes in <b>antibody</b> excess were most effective in the complex before levelling off and then decreased in extreme <b>antibody</b> excess. The model demonstration of augmentation by <b>antibody</b> of antigen binding to solid state <b>antibody</b> might by analogy reflect a mechanism of inhibition of lymphocyte cytotoxicity.

5|$|In summary, the Fab {{region of}} the {{antibody}} determines antigen specificity while the Fc {{region of the}} antibody determines the antibody's class effect. Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody, the classes of heavy chain in <b>antibodies</b> determine their class effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in <b>antibodies</b> include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This infers different isotypes of <b>antibodies</b> have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of <b>antibodies</b> include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be mediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, Michael Heidelberger and Oswald Avery {{observed}} that antigens could be precipitated by <b>antibodies</b> {{and went on}} to show that <b>antibodies</b> are made of protein. The biochemical properties of antigen-antibody-binding interactions were examined in more detail in the late 1930s by John Marrack. The next major advance was in the 1940s, when Linus Pauling confirmed the lock-and-key theory proposed by Ehrlich by showing that the interactions between <b>antibodies</b> and antigens depend more on their shape than their chemical composition. In 1948, Astrid Fagreaus discovered that B cells, in the form of plasma cells, were responsible for generating <b>antibodies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Monoclonal <b>antibodies,</b> {{which are}} drugs {{of the same}} family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of {{interest}} and research. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and CD20 monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied {{by the appearance of}} potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus <b>antibodies</b> which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.|$|E
40|$|Paediatric {{patients}} with <b>antibody</b> deficiency may either be delayed in development of humoral immunity {{or may be}} persistently deficient in <b>antibody</b> production. To differentiate between these entities, we examined the 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide (PnPS) vaccine-induced IgM-, IgG- and IgA <b>antibody</b> responses in a cohort of 66 children with recurrent respiratory tract infections. Individual serum titres against 11 pneumococcal serotypes were measured by Luminex. The cohort contained 33 <b>antibody</b> deficiency patients, 17 transient <b>antibody</b> deficiency patients and 16 {{patients with}}out <b>antibody</b> deficiency diagnosis (control group).
