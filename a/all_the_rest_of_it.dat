Exteriors were shot in the busiest, noisiest areas with crowds of young Tony Curtis fans occasionally breaking through police barriers. Mackendrick remembered, [...] "We started shooting in Times Square at rush hour, and we had high-powered actors and a camera crane and police help and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but we didn’t have any script. We knew {{where we were going}} vaguely, but that’s all".|$|E

Hill said that he enjoyed the experience and [...] "I wouldn't rule [...] out, but I can't honestly say that right now I need to race. That is the bit that is missing.

She wrote about the ideal qualities found in an actress, and what girls might do to develop them. She received a torrent of letters from readers—many were from girls asking [...] "Must I be able to ride" [...] and [...] "Must I be able to swim". In response, Michelena described in the column how those skills were helpful to a movie actress, but not absolutely necessary; she said they [...] "are accessories to, rather than {{the substance of the}} thing... I would advise every girl entering motion pictures to learn to ride and swim and do <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but I would have her realize their subordination to the really artistic side of the profession." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some lesbian feminists such as Julie Bindel {{are still}} {{critical}} of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a [...] "fashionable trend" [...] being promoted due to [...] "sexual hedonism" [...] and broached {{the question of}} whether bisexuality even exists. She has also made tongue-in-cheek comparisons of bisexuals to cat fanciers and devil worshippers. Lesbian feminists initially faced discrimination in the National Organization for Women. Heterosexual feminists such as Betty Friedan downplayed lesbian issues as not being central to feminist activism. She later admitted that [...] "the whole idea of homosexuality made me profoundly uneasy" [...] and acknowledged that she had been very square and was uncomfortable about lesbianism. [...] "The women's movement was not about sex, but about equal opportunity in jobs and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Yes, I suppose you have to say that freedom of sexual choice is part of that, but it shouldn't be the main issue ...." [...] She ignored lesbians in the National Organization for Women (NOW) initially but objected to what she saw as demands for equal time. [...] "'Homosexuality ... is not, in my opinion, what the women's movement is all about.'" [...] While opposing all repression, she wrote, she refused to wear a purple armband or self-identify as a lesbian (although heterosexual) as an act of political solidarity, considering it not part of the mainstream issues of abortion and child care. In 1977, at the National Women's Conference, she seconded a lesbian rights resolution [...] "which everyone thought I would oppose" [...] in order to [...] "preempt any debate" [...] and move on to other issues she believed were more important and less divisive in the effort to add the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E

She accepted lesbian sexuality, albeit not its politicization. In 1995, at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, she found advice given by Chinese authorities to taxi drivers that naked lesbians would be [...] "cavorting" [...] in their cars so that the drivers should hang sheets outside their cab windows, and that lesbians would have AIDS and so drivers should carry disinfectants, to be [...] "ridiculous", [...] "incredibly stupid" [...] and [...] "insulting". In 1997, she wrote that [...] "children…will ideally come from mother and father." [...] She wrote in 2000, [...] "I'm more relaxed about the whole issue now".|$|E
