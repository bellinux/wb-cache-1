40|$|Delta {{modulation}} plays a {{key role}} in data communication; the problem encountered in delta modulation is the slope over load error, which is inherent in the system. In order for the signal to have good fidelity, the slope-overload error needs to be as small as possible. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>delta</b> <b>modulation</b> reduces the slope over load error to a greater extent. ADM attempts to increase the dynamic range and the tracking capabilities of fixed step-size delta modulation. The adaptive algorithms adjust the step size (from a range of step sizes) to the power level of the signal and thus enhance the dynamic range of the coding system appreciably. This paper suggests a novel 1 -bit <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Delta</b> <b>Modulation</b> technique for improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of Adaptive Delta Modulators (ADM).

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a median-rate speech coder, the {{controlled}} <b>adaptive</b> prediction <b>delta</b> <b>modulation</b> coder (CAPDM), which operates at 16 kb/s with good speech quality and low algorithm complexity [15]. The coder is dedicated to personal communication network (PCN) applications and transmits speech samples {{on the basis of}} packets. It combines the features of one-step looking forward decision, syllabic companding, instan-taneous companding, and adaptive prediction. In addition to the use of a short-term prediction filter, CAPDM also exploits the pitch property to predict speech waveform explicitly. With the aid of a pitch prediction filter, the performance of a CAPDM codec improves about 3 dB in segmental signal-to-noise ratio (SEGSNR). The average SEGSNR of CAPDM. FF is about 21 dB, which is 7 dB over traditional CVSD at 16 kb/s. We also utilize an adaptive postfilter (APF) to enhance the perceptual quality of the decoded speech. The mean opinion score (MOS) listening test of CAPDM. FF with APF shows that its average score achieves 4. 19, which is as good as G. 728 16 -kb/s LD-CELP and is comparable with CCITT G. 721 32 -kb/s ADPCM. The complexity of CAPDM. FF is evaluated to be 8 MIPS, which is much lower than that of LD-CELP and could be further reduced by adopting a smaller correlation window for pitch detection. To solve the problem of packet loss, we developed a packet-based waveform substitution method by reinitializing the codec parame-ters {{at the beginning of each}} packet. The simulation results show that CAPDM. FF could tolerate 5 % of packet loss and still keep an SEGSNR at 10 dB and an MOS at about 3. 0.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{introduce}} <b>Delta</b> <b>Modulation</b> {{as an alternative to}} the more conventional carrier and pulse modulations, Chapter I briefly discusses the carrier and pulse modulations from the standpoint of signal - to - noise ratio, bandwidth occupancy and threshold effects. In this way, the merits of each is brought to the fore and the superiority of FM and PCM can he seen. Chapter II introduces <b>Delta</b> <b>Modulation,</b> a pulse code modulation, giving an extensive review of much of the more prominent literature on the subject. Aspects such as channel capacity, power, spectral densities, overloading, signal - to - noise ratio and bandwidth, are discussed. In Chapter III an experimental Delta-Sigma Modulation System is described in detail, from design to performance. Observations are made which correspond to some made in theory. The system transmits static signals and AC signals up to 20 HZ. The accuracy is good and the circuits simple. In Chapter IV suggestions are made to improve the systemis performance by simple means. Also mentioned are more elaborate means (Continuous <b>Delta</b> <b>Modulation)</b> which enhance the performance considerably but detract from the simplicity. Much of the literature quoted in the bibliography shows and discusses how <b>delta</b> <b>modulation</b> is simple in circuitry yet has all the advantages of PCM.
