5|$|Britten {{had been}} in poor health since {{undergoing}} heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died.

5|$|Its fourth <b>artistic</b> <b>director</b> Chris Coleman {{took over}} in May 2000, and {{recruited}} experienced actors to the company. Coleman had previously co-founded Actor's Express in Atlanta, Georgia, and was the <b>artistic</b> <b>director</b> there. Coleman initially signed on for a three-year contract. Before Coleman began as <b>artistic</b> <b>director</b> with PCS, the company was already the largest live theater production company in Portland. However, the organization was facing sporadic attendance at performances as well as financial difficulties, with a deficit {{at the end of}} 1999 of $700,000. In 2000 PCS had a deficit of $880,000 and a base of 10,000 subscribers. The financial position of the company later stabilized, and Coleman had a 2000 budget of $3.2million to work with when he came on. A 2003 consultant's report, however, found that PCS relied more heavily on gifts and grants to fund its operations than its peers around the company.|$|E
