Truth to tell, {{there is not much}} diabolical in Longfellow's fiend, and it would seem as though Sir Arthur Sullivan had sought on occasion to atone for his comparative mildness by applying a background of orchestration worthy in its sonority of Berlioz or Wagner. Whether Satan could make himself heard in Pandemonium may be an open question, but undoubtedly there are moments in The Golden Legend when Lucifer's human representative, be his voice ever so stentorian, is bound to be inaudible.

5000|$|Manuel Garcia II {{was one of}} {{the first}} to develop a {{scientific}} definition of registers, a definition that is still used by pedagogues and teachers today. [...] "A register is a series of homogeneous sounds produced by one mechanism, differing essentially from another series of equally homogeneous sounds produced by another mechanism." [...] Another definition worth considering is from Clifton Ware. [...] "A series of distinct, consecutive, homogeneous vocal tones that can be maintained in pitch and loudness throughout a certain range." [...] A register consists of the homogeneous tone qualities produced by the same mechanical system whereas Registration is the process of using and combining the registers to achieve <b>artistic</b> <b>singing.</b> For example: a skilled singer moves through their range and dynamics smoothly, so that you are unaware of register changes. This process could be described as good or clean registration.The term “register” came about in the sixteenth century. Before then it was recognized that there were different “voices”. As teachers started to notice how different the areas on either side of the passaggios or breaks in the voice were, it was compared to the different sets of pipes in an organ. These clusters of pipes were called registers, we now use the same term when speaking of voices.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to compare {{definitions}} and descriptions of primary terms for teaching breathing in textbooks of two periods. A review of literature suggested: (a) controversy in approaches and terms used to teach breathing; (b) differences in breathing terminology; (c) standardization of terminology is important for some but not others; (d) researchers seek clarification; and (e) terminology affects vocal production. ^ Thirty-five texts from 1900 - 1910 and 23 texts from 1970 - 1990 were analyzed using a historical/qualitative approach, comparing terms and definitions. ^ Control was the major term 1900 - 1910, involving one, two, or three muscle groups; muscular balance was an important concept. Effort included freedom vs. rigidity and efficiency vs. capacity. For some, nature must be trained; for others, nature should be obeyed. Automatic control was equated with <b>artistic</b> <b>singing.</b> Other primary terms included: (a) breath support, (b) breath management, (c) vocalized breath, (d) natural breathing, (e) appoggio, (f) inspiration-expiration, and (g) respiration. Some pedagogues had no central term, and one was anti-control. ^ There was variance in contemporary terms, yet agreement about concepts. Support/control concurrently were primary terms. Support/control involved two, three, or four muscle groups; balance was also important, although concepts were different, as with effort. Nature should be trained; automatic control indicated <b>artistic</b> <b>singing.</b> Other primary terms included: (a) support, (b) control (separately), (c) support/control/management, (d) management (separately), (e) pressure, (f) appoggio, and (g) energy. One pedagogue had no central term; one was anti-control and anti-terminology. ^ Terms from both periods are compared with Reid 2 ̆ 7 s (1983) A Dictionary of Vocal Terminology. Appoggio is suggested for teaching, as are learning style and student inventories. Future research suggests historical/comparative and qualitative studio studies. ...|$|E

40|$|In the Basque Country, as I {{have not}} only noticed but also felt myself, singing and music are not {{confined}} to stage art. This is a natural and spontaneous expression of people’s life. ” Miguel Angel Estrellas, pianist The tremendous importance of singing and music {{in the life of}} the Basque people is doubtless. Of <b>artistic</b> disciplines, <b>singing</b> in the first place reflects the rich sonority of the Basque language. It accompanies major moments of the people’s life, going easily beyond geographical and linguistic boundaries. Although singing in the Basque Country is one of the strongest varieties of social practice, over the recent years a certain decline of the collective memory, flaws in handing down the tradition of singing are negatively reflected in it. This is due to the fact that family no longer carries this function and there are no relevant training centres for children and young performers. Taking into account this situation, in 1998 the Institute of Basque Culture worked out a long-term project for the protection of Basque singing and music Kantuketan (“In Search of Singing”), which has been carrying out successfully to the present day.
