5|$|Conspiracy {{theorists have}} long {{associated}} Freemasonry with the New World Order and the Illuminati, and state that Freemasonry as an organisation is either bent on world domination or already secretly {{in control of}} world politics. Historically, Freemasonry has attracted criticism—and suppression—from both the politically far right (e.g., Nazi Germany) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> left (e.g. the former Communist states in Eastern Europe).|$|E

The band was not a permanent orchestra, but planned to reconvene in 2011 when Bach's St John Passion {{was to be the}} focus of their work.|$|E

5|$|In April 1949, Truman {{appointed}} Radford to {{the position}} of Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. A staunch anticommunist, Radford saw the greatest threat to U.S. security coming from Asia, not Europe. He traveled extensively throughout the Pacific as well as South Asia <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> East. He became acquainted with political and military leaders in New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaya, Burma, India, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Formosa, and Japan, and learned about the sociopolitical issues facing each nation and the region as a whole.|$|E

5|$|In October 1992 Delrina {{acquired}} Amaze Inc., based out of Kirkland, Washington.

5|$|According to Louis Philippe, the game's audio director, {{the team}} {{originally}} used intense music and sounds to create tension. However, the team decided to scrap this idea, {{realizing that the}} best way to create a tense atmosphere is to create the sounds of other players, which are often unexpected. The team created Navigation Sounds, in which the sound a player made is determined by their operators' weight, armor, and speed. Gadget deployment such as fortifying and breach-charging create louder sounds that may reveal the player's presence. The team thought that this would be enjoyable for players and influence their gameplay experience. The game's music was composed by Paul Haslinger, who had worked on the score of the previous Rainbow Six games <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> Cry series. His co-composer was Ben Frost, who debuted his first video game soundtrack with Siege. Leon Purviance assisted Frost and Haslinger in composing the music.|$|E
5|$|Although the Wehrmacht's {{offensive}} {{had been}} stopped, German intelligence estimated that Soviet forces {{had no more}} reserves left and thus {{would be unable to}} stage a counteroffensive. This estimate proved wrong, as Stalin transferred over 18 divisions, 1,700 tanks, and over 1,500 aircraft from Siberia <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> East. The Red Army had accumulated a 58-division reserve by early December, when the offensive proposed by Zhukov and Vasilevsky was finally approved by Stalin. Even with these new reserves, Soviet forces committed to the operation numbered only 1,100,000 men, only slightly outnumbering the Wehrmacht. Nevertheless, with careful troop deployment, a ratio of two-to-one was reached at some critical points.|$|E

5|$|Born in Portsmouth, Sellers {{made his}} stage debut at the Kings Theatre, Southsea, {{when he was}} two weeks old. He began {{accompanying}} his parents in a variety act that toured the provincial theatres. He first worked as a drummer and toured around England {{as a member of}} the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). He developed his mimicry and improvisational skills during a spell in Ralph Reader's wartime Gang Show entertainment troupe, which toured Britain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> East. After the war, Sellers made his radio debut in ShowTime, and eventually became a regular performer on various BBC radio shows. During the early 1950s, Sellers, along with Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine, took part in the successful radio series The Goon Show, which ended in 1960.|$|E
5|$|By 1966, Braathens SAFE {{had sold}} all its DC-4s, and had {{purchased}} eight F-27s. The DC-6s were used exclusively for charter, with all domestic flights being flown with the F-27s. The same year, the booking system was centralized {{and moved to}} offices in Oslo. The company established sales offices in Bodø and Tromsø on 1 March 1967. A new cargo department was opened at Oslo Airport on 29 September. Braathens SAFE applied in {{a joint venture with}} the Norwegian America Line to start a cargo flight to the United States <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> East, but this was declined by the ministry. From 1967, also DC-6s were used on domestic routes. In August, it was announced that Braathens SAFE would replace the F-27s with six new Fokker F-28, and that the F-27s would be sold to the manufacturer. Later, the number of orders of 737s was reduced to two, and of F-28s to five. The Fellowships cost NOK40 million each.|$|E

5|$|East coast trade hummed, with goods {{arriving}} from Golkonda where rice, millet, pulses and tobacco were grown {{on a large}} scale. Dye crops of indigo and chay root were produced for the weaving industry. A mineral rich region, Machilipatnam was the gateway for high quality iron and steel exports. Diamond mining {{was active in the}} Kollur region. The cotton weaving industry produced two types of cottons, plain calico and muslin (brown, bleached or dyed). Cloth printed with coloured patterns crafted by native techniques were exported to Java <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Far</b> East. Golkonda specialised in plain cotton and Pulicat in printed. The main imports on the east coast were non-ferrous metals, camphor, porcelain, silk and luxury goods.|$|E
5|$|Ficus rubiginosas range {{spans the}} entire eastern {{coastline}} of Australia, {{from the top}} of the Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland to the vicinity of Bega on the south coast of New South Wales. The range extends westwards to Porcupine Gorge National Park in Queensland <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> western plains in New South Wales. F.rubiginosa f. rubiginosa and F.rubiginosa f. glabrescens are found over most of the range, though the latter does not occur south past the New South Wales-Queensland border region. Lithophytic, hemiepiphytic and tree forms can be found together in local populations of plants.|$|E
5|$|Grey currawongs {{are found}} {{right across the}} {{southern}} part of Australia from the Central Coast region of New South Wales, occurring south of latitude 32°S southwards and westwards, from the vicinity of Mudgee in the north and southwest to Temora and Albury onto the Riverina and across most of Victoria and southern South Australia to the fertile south-west corner of Western Australia and the semi-arid country surrounding it. The clinking subspecies is endemic to Tasmania, where it is more common in the eastern parts, but is absent from King and Flinders Islands in Bass Strait. There is an outlying population in the arid area where the Northern Territory meets South Australia and Western Australia. In general, the grey currawong is sedentary throughout its range, although it appears to be resident in the cooler months only in south Gippsland in eastern Victoria <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> south coast of New South Wales.|$|E
