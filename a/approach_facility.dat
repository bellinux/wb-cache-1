Librarians have used collaborative learning in traditional classrooms and are beginning to incorporate it into hands-on computer classrooms. As librarians develop computer-based collaborative environments, they will likely face issues that lead them to reconsider how they <b>approach</b> <b>facility</b> design, curricular strategies, student expectations, teaching styles, and classroom time management. This article makes a case for using collaborative learning within library computer classrooms and describes how librarians at a medium-sized university made the transition from hands-on individualized learning to hands-on collaborative learning...|$|E
40|$|The Multiple Kill Vehicle (MKV) system, {{which is}} being {{developed}} by the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA), is a midcourse payload that includes a carrier vehicle {{and a number of}} small kill vehicles. During the mission, the carrier vehicle dispenses the kill vehicles to address a complex threat environment and directs each kill vehicle toward the intercept point for its assigned threat object. As part of the long range carrier vehicle sensor development strategy, MDA and project leaders have developed a pathfinder sensor and {{are in the process of}} developing two subsequent demonstration sensors to provide proof of concept and to demonstrate technology. To increase the probability of successful development of the sensor system, detailed calibration measurements have been included as part of the sensor development. A detailed sensor calibration can provide a thorough understanding of sensor operation and performance, verifying that the sensor can meet the mission requirements. This approach to instrument knowledge will help ensure the program success and reduce cost and schedule risks. The Space Dynamics Laboratory at Utah State University (SDL) completed a calibration test campaign for the pathfinder sensor in April 2008. Similar calibration efforts are planned in 2009 for the two demonstration sensors. This paper provides an overview of calibration benefits, requirements, <b>approach,</b> <b>facility,</b> measurements, and preliminary results of the pathfinder calibration.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a {{strategy}} framework for coordinating decentralized autonomous agents is presented and applied within a smart energy grid. The framework brings together {{the concept of}} policy-based computing and market-based coordination. In this context, agents {{can be seen as}} self-interested entities that are governed by their local policies. Efficient coordination between these self-interested agents is realized through a market mechanism that incentivizes the agents to reveal their policies to the market. By knowing the agent’s policies, an efficient solution for the overall system can be determined. Leveraging a declarative, policy-based <b>approach</b> <b>facilities</b> the specification of highly customizable strategies that can be easily adapted to various resources and markets. As an example for a realworld application, the framework is used for efficient balancing of decentralized energy supply (e. g. photovoltaic, wind power, CHP) and demand (e. g. households, businesses) in a power grid. ...|$|R

40|$|Type systems {{currently}} available for imperative languages are {{too weak to}} detect a significant class of programming errors. For example, they cannot express the property that a list is doubly-linked or circular. We propose {{a solution to this}} problem based on a notion of shape types defined as context-free graph grammars. We define graphs in settheoretic terms, and graph modifications as multiset rewrite rules. These rules can be checked statically to ensure that they preserve the structure of the graph specified by the grammar. We provide a syntax for a smooth integration of shape types in C. The programmer can still express pointer manipulations with the expected constant time execution and benefits from the additional guarantee that the property specified by the shape type is an invariant of the program. 1 Motivation and <b>approach</b> <b>Facilities</b> for explicit pointer manipulation are useful for certain classes of applications, but they may lead to a very error-prone style of programming [...] . ...|$|R
