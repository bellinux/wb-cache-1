40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of novel energy {{absorbing}} materials to reduce vibration transmitted through helicopter pilot <b>seat</b> <b>cushions.</b> A type of engineered material known as the Hybrid Air Cushioning System (HACS) was integrated into the design of helicopter <b>seat</b> <b>cushions</b> in addition to conventional foam materials. The prototype <b>seat</b> <b>cushions</b> were preliminarily evaluated as the bottom <b>seat</b> <b>cushion</b> on a Bell- 412 non-armoured pilot seat through mechanical shaker tests. The promising cushion designs were further evaluated on a Bell- 412 helicopter through extensive flight tests and aircrew configurations. The pilot whole-body vibration levels were assessed in accordance with ISO 2613 - 1 : 1997 standard. The flight test results demonstrated that the prototype cushions were able to reduce significantly the pilot whole-body vibration. Therefore, the integration of HACS with Bell- 412 <b>seat</b> <b>cushion</b> {{can serve as a}} low cost solution to mitigate the vibration levels transmitted to helicopter pilots.

40|$|Whole-body {{vibration}} exposure {{has been found}} to be detrimental to the health of humans owing to effects such as degraded comfort, disc degeneration, and lower back pain. The purpose of this study was to determine if selected <b>seat</b> <b>cushions</b> and back supports minimize the transmission of vibrations during manual wheelchair propulsion. Ten unimpaired participants traversed an activities of daily living course using four <b>seat</b> <b>cushions</b> and four back supports. Vibrations were measured using triaxial accelerometers. The time domain and frequency domain transmissibility was used to determine if differences exist among <b>seat</b> <b>cushions</b> and back supports. Differences were found among the four <b>seat</b> <b>cushions</b> and four back supports. <b>Seat</b> <b>cushion</b> and back support manufacturers should concentrate on single-event shocks and repeated shocks, as opposed to oscillatory motions and self-generated vibrations, because the vibrations generated by these events tend to reside in the range of frequencies most sensitive to humans. Vibrations in this range of frequencies have the greatest effect on the transmission of whole-body vibration during manual wheelchair propulsion. Differences among the <b>seat</b> <b>cushions</b> and back supports appear to be due to the seat cushion/back support design and postural support. From a clinical perspective, the time domain transmissibility best describes the transmission of whole-body vibration. © 2003 RESNA...|$|R

The aim of the investigation was: to determine <b>seat</b> <b>cushion</b> stiffness of a chair selected from a set of dining-room furniture, to determine values and distributions of contact strains on the seat surface caused by loading pad of different hardness, numerical calculation of contact strains between the <b>seat</b> <b>cushion</b> and the loading pad and to verify the results of these calculations with the results of laboratory experiments. The performed tests showed that the assessment of the <b>seat</b> <b>cushion</b> stiffness and the evaluation of contact stresses on their surface should be carried out using an equally stiff loading pad. In numerical calculations, polyurethane foams should be modeled as hyperfoam bodies of σ=f(ε) characteristics determined in an axial compression test.

40|$|This study {{conducted}} {{a series of}} road tests in the regular fleet operations of a revenue service to better understand the relationship between vehicle seat design and driver fatigue, improve two newly proposed objective methods for evaluating driver fatigue, and provide design guidelines for evaluating and improving vehicle seat characteristics in terms of driver fatigue. Each driver completed a test session on two <b>seat</b> <b>cushions</b> – one a polyurethane foam cushion and one an air-inflated cushion. Objective measurements of pressure distribution were taken throughout each test session, while subjective measurements were collected using surveys taken at one-hour intervals. Based on these results, we find that the air-inflated <b>seat</b> <b>cushion</b> has advantages in terms of subjective measures of comfort, support, and fatigue. We show that the objective measure aPcrms highlights characteristic differences between <b>seat</b> <b>cushions,</b> as the air-inflated <b>seat</b> <b>cushion</b> provides less area in high pressure regions, thus occluding less blood flow to tissue in the seated area. While we were unable to effectively assess the validity of the proposed measures or improve them further, the characteristic difference between <b>seat</b> <b>cushions</b> is not highlighted by using previously existing objective measures. This implies that aPcrms is a more useful measure and should be considered when evaluating the subjective quality of <b>seat</b> <b>cushion</b> designs under dynamic conditions, such as those existing in commercial truck driving. ii...|$|R

40|$|For {{a design}} {{of an office}} chair, the {{pressure}} distribution of human body load on the chair seat has to be known. This information is the key characteristic of an office chair. This thesis concerns a mechanical model, its implementation and simulation of a human body sitting on an office chair’s wooden <b>seat</b> <b>cushion.</b> Firstly, Autodesk Inventor is used for modelling the human body, and the <b>seat</b> <b>cushion.</b> Secondly, we use the finite element method to mesh the models. Thirdly, fixed support and gravity load for the models are applied. Finally, the pressure distribution on the contact area is simulated in Autodesk Inventor. The peak pressure comes out in the contact area between ischium and <b>seat</b> <b>cushion,</b> what matches results from former reports, based on {{the measure of the}} pressure distribution of the contact region between human body and <b>seat</b> <b>cushion</b> using many sensors.

40|$|Unrelieved {{pressure}} on load-bearing muscle tissues of humans can produce pressure ulcers. In a seated upright posture, the highest pressures occur {{inferior to the}} ischial tuberosities (ITs). Moreover, the vibration can initiate the development of pressure ulcer. Therefore, the <b>seat</b> <b>cushion</b> is not only used to lower the maximum seating {{pressure on}} buttocks but also minimize the transmission of vibration to human body. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of varying vertical vibration frequencies on seat-interface contact pressure during sitting on three different <b>seat</b> <b>cushions</b> by using a finite element modeling approach. A simplified two-dimensional human buttock-thigh model was developed to simulate the mechanical response of the muscle of buttocks and thigh under vertical vibration. Static and vibrational loads with five different frequencies of 0. 1, 1, 10, 30 and 50 Hz and the same amplitude of 3 mm were applied to different <b>seat</b> <b>cushions.</b> The result showed that the “SAF 6060 ” <b>seat</b> <b>cushion</b> with both hyperelastic and viscoelastic behaviors could be effective in reducing the amplitude of varying maximum contact pressure, especially for the frequency of 10 - 20 Hz.

40|$|Purpose: Farmers with {{spinal cord}} {{injuries}} operate agricultural machinery and attempt to reduce their risk of pressure ulcers with aftermarket <b>seat</b> <b>cushions.</b> Research is limited in testing aftermarket cushions under dynamic conditions. The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare the seated pressure data of participants under five different types of <b>seat</b> <b>cushions.</b> We predict that <b>seat</b> <b>cushions</b> with greater immersion will result in lower maximum pressures resulting in a lower risk of developing a pressure ulcer. Methods: Using a quasi-experimental design, eight participants were recruited through an informal convenience sampling method. Participants met the inclusion criteria by having paralysis or a spinal cord injury that causes a significant impairment to their motor or sensory functions. An FSA pressure mapping system was used as the instrument to collect pressure data as participants completed five trials of sitting on a tractor seat while dynamically suspended on a platform constructed to replicate dynamic conditions. Testing trials were repeated on a tractor seat alone, with a foam cushion, with a low profile air bladder cushion, with a mid-profile air bladder cushion, and with a high profile air bladder cushion. The cushion conditions were randomized. Data was analyzed using SAS software. Results: Based on pressure mapping data collected, results indicate that all the aftermarket cushions provided a statistically significant lower dispersion index compared to the tractor seat alone. In comparison to each other, however, the dispersion indexes of the aftermarket cushions showed no statistically significant difference. Conclusion: Due to the limited number of participants in this study, statistical conclusions cannot be made at this time. The results of this study reveal the need for further research and field testing of <b>seat</b> <b>cushions</b> in an operating tractor.

40|$|Pilots of the MH- 60 S {{helicopter}} {{are exposed}} to continuous whole body vibration (WBV). Pilot fatigue is a growing operational concern due to the increased frequency of extended durations of missions (6 - 8 +hours) in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. Endurance aspects of the currently used rotary wing seating systems were not optimized for the longer missions and wide range of pilot anthropometric measurements, which is now typical of naval aviation. The current seating systems were designed primarily to meet crashworthiness requirements, not for {{the wide range of}} pilot anthropometry or to mitigate WBV. Albeit, an issue, pilot fatigue and reduced mission effectiveness are also critical concerns. Current Hazard Reports indicated that pain in pilots 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 legs and backs begin two to four hours into the flight and increase with time. Mission readiness also decreases with an increase in flight duration due to the constant distraction of pilots shifting in their seats while trying to get comfortable. Froom, et al [2] reported a dose-response relationship between the length of military helicopter flights and back discomfort. He also concluded that this pain is typically dull, over the lower back, and its prevalence and intensity are dependent on the total flight hours of exposure. Methods This study evaluated WBV produced in the pilot seating systems onboard the MH- 60 S. The {{purpose of the study was}} to test and compare the effectiveness of two different <b>seat</b> <b>cushions,</b> the current <b>seat</b> <b>cushion</b> versus an anti-vibration <b>seat</b> <b>cushion.</b> Both <b>seat</b> <b>cushions</b> were measured for acceleration levels averaged over five-minute intervals using a triaxial seat pad accelerometer. The recordings were completed for a 3 -hour straight and level flight. A frequency analysis from 0 - 80 hertz (Hz) was conducted on all acceleration measurements to determine the dominant axis and frequency of the pilots 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 vibration exposure. The results were then compared to the applicable Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) established by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) [1] and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 2631. 1 [3] to determine the MH- 60 S pilots 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 permissible exposure time for both <b>seat</b> <b>cushions.</b> Results The results of the study showed that for both <b>seat</b> <b>cushions</b> the vibration levels of the z-axis at 16 Hz had the shortest allowable exposure duration, according to the ACGIH TLVs.
