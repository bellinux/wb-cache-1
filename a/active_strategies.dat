The effect of this strategy on patients' physical functioning, coping strategy, and beliefs regarding their low back pain was studied. SUBJECTS: One hundred thirteen primary care physical therapists treated a total of 500 patients. METHODS: The physical therapists were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. The control group received the guidelines by mail (standard passive method of dissemination). The intervention group, in contrast, received an additional <b>active</b> training <b>strategy</b> consisting of 2 sessions with education, group discussion, role playing, feedback, and reminders. Patients with low back pain, treated by the participating therapists, completed questionnaires on physical functioning, pain, sick leave, coping, and beliefs. RESULTS: Physical functioning and pain in the 2 groups improved substantially in the first 12 weeks. Multilevel longitudinal analysis showed no differences between the 2 groups on any outcome measure during follow-up.

We use ten macroeconomic and financial variables as the predicting variables.

Based on the selected forecasting models, the Sharpe ratio strategy and the Tactical Asset Allocation strategy are used to construct an optimal portfolio.

In the scenarios of zero and low transaction costs, both <b>active</b> <b>strategies</b> generate substantially higher mean returns with much lower standard deviation than the passive buy-and-hold strategy. Moreover, even with high transaction costs, the <b>active</b> <b>strategies</b> are still superior to passive strategy in terms of Sharpe ratio on the portfolios.

30|$|Deadlock {{problem solving}} {{strategies}} {{can be classified}} into <b>active</b> <b>strategies</b> and passive strategies. <b>Active</b> <b>strategies</b> solve a deadlock before it occurs by online or offline methods. <b>Active</b> <b>strategies</b> include deadlock prevention strategy and deadlock avoiding strategy. The main purpose of deadlock prevention strategy {{is to ensure that}} the system always stays away from a deadlock state. It uses offline calculation mechanism to control the request and allocation of resource through imposing restrictions to the system. Various deadlock prevention strategies are proposed in recent years. Yi-Sheng et al. [15] proposed a deadlock prevention algorithm for sequence resource allocation systems, employing Petri nets to build and describe the systems of simple sequential the processes with resources (S 3 PGR) model. On the other hand, for the deadlock avoiding strategy, system state is monitored continuously in the process of system operation. The system scheduling policy will judge whether a process will lead to a deadlock or not and then decides the next system operation process. Ballaletal [16] proposed the MAXWIP (Max a work in progress) algorithm for deadlock avoidance in mobile wireless sensor network monitoring systems, which was described as Free Choice Multi-Reentrant Flow Line (FMRF) systems.The advantage of this method is that system operating efficiency can be kept in the greatest degree. But it must obtain all the system reachable states first, which is not realistic in medium- or large-scale systems.|$|E
