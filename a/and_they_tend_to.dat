5|$|The seductive details {{effect has}} {{primarily}} been demonstrated {{at the point}} of knowledge acquisition (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous for transfer performance because of the schematic representation of information that trainees form during instruction. Researchers have described the seductive details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts trainees from learning <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> form inappropriate schemas to organize information. However, when learners are applying knowledge, empirical studies suggest that the distortion of the macro structure or schema of the instructional material is beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E

5|$|Horses, plains zebras and {{mountain}} zebras live in stable, closed family groups or harems consisting of one adult male, several females and their offspring. These groups {{have their own}} home ranges which overlap <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be nomadic. The stability of the group remains even when the family stallion dies or is displaced. Plains zebra groups gather into large herds and may create temporarily stable subgroups within a herd, allowing individuals to interact with those outside their group. Among harem-holding species, this behavior has only otherwise been observed in primates like the gelada and the hamadryas baboon. Females of harem species benefit as males give them more time for feeding, protection for their young, as well as protection from predators and harassment by outside males. Among females in a harem, a linear dominance hierarchy exists based on the time at which they join the group. Harems travel in a consistent filing order with the high-ranking mares and their offspring leading the groups followed by the next highest ranking mare and her offspring and so on. The family stallion takes up the rear. Social grooming (which involves individuals rubbing their heads against each other and nipping with the incisors and lips) is important for easing aggression and maintaining social bonds and status. Young of both sexes leave their natal groups as they mature; females are usually abducted by outside males to be included as permanent members of their harems.|$|E

25|$|The {{extent of}} Philo's {{knowledge}} of Hebrew is debated. His numerous etymologies of Hebrew names—which are {{along the lines}} of the etymologic midrash to Genesis and of the earlier rabbinism, though not modern Hebrew philology—suggest some familiarity. Philo offers for some names three or four etymologies, sometimes including the correct Hebrew root (e.g., , descent, as the origin of the name Jordan). However his works do not display much understanding of Hebrew grammar, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> follow the translation of the Septuagint more closely than the Hebrew version.|$|E
25|$|Besides these routes, {{there are}} tractor routes along the {{climbing}} routes. These tractor routes {{are used to}} bring food and other materials to huts on the mountain. Because the tractors usually take {{up most of the}} width of these paths <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> push large rocks {{from the side of the}} path, the tractor paths are off-limits to the climbers on sections that are not merged with the climbing or descending paths. Nevertheless, one can sometimes see people riding mountain bikes along the tractor routes down from the summit. This is particularly risky, as it becomes difficult to control speed and may send some rocks rolling along the side of the path, which may hit other people.|$|E

25|$|The {{importance}} {{of how a}} woman perceives her behavior should not be underestimated. Many women perceived sex as a chore {{as opposed to a}} pleasurable experience, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> consider themselves sexually inadequate, which in turn does not motivate them to engage in sexual activity. Several factors influence a women's perception of her sexual life. These can include: race, her gender, ethnicity, educational background, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, financial resources, culture, and religion. Cultural differences are also present in how women view menopause and its impact on health, self-image, and sexuality. A study has found that African American women are the most optimistic about menopausal life; Caucasian women are the most anxious, Asian women are the most inhibited about their symptoms, and Hispanic women are the most stoic.|$|E
500|$|An ontological {{argument}} is a philosophical {{argument for the}} existence of God that uses ontology. [...] Many arguments fall under the category of the ontological, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> involve arguments about the state of being or existing. [...] More specifically, ontological arguments tend to start with an a priori theory about the organization of the universe. [...] If that organizational structure is true, the argument will provide reasons why God must exist.|$|E
500|$|Mauna Loa ( [...] or Hawaiian: [...] ) {{is one of}} five volcanoes {{that form}} the Island of Hawaii in the U.S. state of Hawaiʻi in the Pacific Ocean.

50|$|These vases are {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most famous models introduced by the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres; patrons such as Madame de Pompadour and her brother the Marquis de Marigny collected the form. Among the largest vessels produced by the factory, these vases were extremely difficult to fire; the multiple openwork piercings in the body weakened the overall structure, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> collapse in the kiln. Consequently, only about twelve were ever produced, ten of which survive today.|$|R

However, Gramsci's sympathies then did not lie with socialism, but rather with the grievances of impoverished Sardinian peasants <b>and</b> miners. <b>They</b> perceived their neglect {{as a result of}} privileges enjoyed by the rapidly industrialising North, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> turn to a growing Sardinian nationalism, brutally repressed by troops from the Italian mainland, as a response.|$|R
500|$|An {{interview}} in the August 2006 issue of PC Gamer magazine revealed that the Hunter stands [...] tall. Erik Johnson, the game's project lead, states that the Hunters are [...] "big and impressive, but they can go anywhere the player can go", as the player can encounter them both indoors and outdoors. Ted Backman, senior artist for Valve, talks about how the Hunter can express emotions, being a somewhat non-human character. [...] "We want the Hunter {{to be able to}} express nervousness or aggression, [...] whether it's aggressive, hurt, or mad." [...] Hunters are very aggressive <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> operate in packs, but can also be found supporting other Combine troops. Late in the game, they can be found escorting Striders, using their flechette guns to protect the Striders that the player is trying to attack.|$|E
500|$|The platonic close male {{relationships}} in television and film science fiction have been reinterpreted by fans as slash fiction – Kirk/Spock being the earliest example. Slash cannot be commercially distributed due to copyright, {{and until the}} 1990s was either undistributed or published in zines. With {{the advent of the}} internet, the slash fiction community of fans and writers began to cluster at sites such as fanfiction.net, and websites and fanzines dedicated to popular speculative fiction franchises such as X-files and Star Trek have become common. The use of characters from major SF franchises in [...] "gay readings" [...] has caused legal action: LucasFilm has sent cease and desist orders to prevent gay reinterpretations of Star Wars characters, and Anne Rice is notorious for attempts to stop production of slash fiction based on her Vampire Chronicles characters, although many of the characters are bisexual in canon. Slash fiction has been described as important to the LGBT community and the formation of queer identities, as it represents a resistance to the expectation of compulsory heterosexuality, but has also been noted as being unrepresentative of the gay community, being more a medium to express feminist dissatisfactions with SF. According to polls, most of slash fandom is made up of heterosexual women with a college degree. These demographics are older than the yaoi fans <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be more easily disturbed about slash depicting underage sexuality, but this is becoming less true due to the popularity of Harry Potter-inspired slash fiction.|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, the {{historical}} developments surrounding {{the formation of}} Ekiti towns and villages {{were based on the}} fact that most settlements had witnessed different stages of dispersal in human settlement, break-apart, dislocation or relocation of towns, migration and the arrival of new settlers shortly before, during and after the Yoruba wars of the 19th century. [...] However, it is an interesting fact that these towns and communities live close-by without capacity to dominate or obliterate each other <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> preserve their autonomy as distinct groups with separate traditional institution while professing same kinship (homogeneity) and sub-ethnic identity.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the above mentioned [...] "social question" [...] prompted unrest among the workers at the nitrate oficinas in the Tarapacá Province.
