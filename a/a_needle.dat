5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hypothyroidism without any lumps or masses felt within the thyroid gland {{does not require}} thyroid imaging; however, if the thyroid feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended. The presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) makes {{it more likely that}} thyroid nodules are caused by autoimmune thyroiditis, but if there is any doubt, <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> biopsy may be required.|$|E
5|$|Permanent body piercings are {{performed}} {{by creating an}} opening in the body using a sharp object through the area to be pierced. This can either be done by puncturing an opening using <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> (usually a hollow medical needle) or scalpel or by removing tissue, either with a dermal punch or through scalpelling.|$|E

5|$|The {{piercing}} needle: The {{standard method}} in the United States involves making an opening using a beveled-tip hollow medical needle, {{which is available}} in different lengths, gauges and even shapes. While straight needles are useful for many body parts, curved needles are manufactured for areas where straight needles are not ideal. The needle selected is typically the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with cartilage piercings) as the initial jewellery to be worn, with higher gauges indicating thinner needles. The needle is inserted into the body part being pierced, frequently by hand but sometimes {{with the aid of}} <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> holder or pusher. While the needle is still in the body, the initial jewellery to be worn in the piercing is pushed through the opening, following the back of the needle. Jewellery is often inserted into the hollow end of <b>a</b> <b>needle,</b> so that as the needle pulls through the jewellery is left behind.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} {{frequent}} mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products. Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, {{with an average}} of 0.8%. The risk of acquiring HIV from <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act. In the United States intravenous drug users made up 12% of all new cases of HIV in 2009, and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV positive.|$|E
5|$|CSF can {{be tested}} for the {{diagnosis}} {{of a variety of}} neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested. About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture, and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.|$|E

Eventually, Mulder and Crump make amends and attempt to work out a solution before it is too late. Mulder explains to Crump that Scully will meet them at the Pacific Coast, the end of the highway. There she will insert <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> into Crump's inner ear, hopefully relieving the pressure. Unfortunately, when Scully arrives, Crump has already died.|$|E
5|$|The {{indwelling}} cannula: Outside of the United States, many piercers use <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> {{containing a}} cannula (or catheter), a hollow plastic tube {{placed at the}} end of the needle. In some countries, the piercing needle favoured in the United States is regarded as a medical device and is illegal for body piercers. The procedure is similar to the piercing needle method, but the initial jewellery is inserted into the back of the cannula and the cannula and the jewellery are then pulled through the piercing. More bleeding may follow, as the piercing is larger than the jewellery.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid envelops {{the brain}} and the spine, and lumbar {{puncture}} or spinal tap is the removal of {{a small amount of}} fluid using <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> inserted between the lumbar vertebrae. Characteristic findings in Guillain–Barré syndrome are an elevated protein level, usually greater than 0.55g/L, and fewer than 10 white blood cells per cubic millimeter of fluid ("albuminocytological dissociation"). This combination distinguishes Guillain–Barré syndrome from other conditions (such as lymphoma and poliomyelitis) in which both the protein and the cell count are elevated. Elevated CSF protein levels are found in approximately 50% of patients in the first 3 days after onset of weakness, which increases to 80% after the first week.|$|E

50|$|The fourth type of <b>needle</b> is <b>a</b> hybrid <b>needle.</b> It is <b>a</b> {{straight}} <b>needle</b> with <b>a</b> {{point on}} one end and a flexible strand {{on the other end}} with a stopper, such as a large lightweight bead, at the end. This type of <b>needle</b> allows <b>a</b> larger project to be worked at one time than <b>a</b> straight <b>needle,</b> while folding up quickly and more compactly for travel.|$|R
5|$|Having {{ensured that}} {{sufficient}} tissue {{has been removed}} to allow the desired fusion of the skin, the circumciser pulls together the {{opposite sides of the}} labia majora, ensuring that the raw edges where the skin has been removed are well approximated. The wound is now ready to be stitched or for thorns to be applied. If <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> and thread are being used, close tight sutures will be placed to ensure that a flap of skin covers the vulva and extends from the mons veneris to the perineum, and which, after the wound heals, will form a bridge of scar tissue that will totally occlude the vaginal introitus.|$|E
5|$|In a large PSP (>50%), or in a PSP {{associated}} with breathlessness, some guidelines recommend that reducing the size by aspiration is equally effective as {{the insertion of}} a chest tube. This involves the administration of local anesthetic and inserting <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> connected to a three-way tap; up to 2.5liters of air (in adults) are removed. If there has been significant reduction {{in the size of}} the pneumothorax on subsequent X-ray, the remainder of the treatment can be conservative. This approach has been shown to be effective in over 50% of cases. Compared to tube drainage, first-line aspiration in PSP reduces the number of people requiring hospital admission, without increasing the risk of complications.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, lumbar {{puncture}} {{may be required}} {{if there is a}} suspicion that the symptoms might be caused by other problems (meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage). This is the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord; the sample is obtained with <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> that is passed under local anesthetic into the spine. In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary has entered the subarachnoid space. If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRI with a contrast agent) may be required to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels, {{the most common cause of}} SAH.|$|E

5|$|The 'Beating of the bounds' is {{an ancient}} annual custom first carried out in 1612, which revives the {{traditional}} checking of the sea boundaries awarded to Poole by the Cinque Port of Winchelsea in 1364. The Admiral of the Port of Poole (the mayor) and other dignitaries, {{and members of the}} public sail {{from the mouth of the}} River Frome to Old Harry Rocks to confirm the Mayor's authority over the water boundaries of the harbour and check for any encroachments. As there are no physical landmarks that can be beaten at sea, traditionally children from Poole were encouraged to remember the bounds of their town by taking part in the 'Pins and Points' ceremony involving the beating of a boy and pricking of a girl's hand with <b>a</b> <b>needle.</b> In modern times, the acts have been symbolically carried out.|$|E

5|$|When a nodule is present, thyroid {{function}} {{tests are}} performed and reveal {{whether a person}} has a normal amount of thyroid hormones ("euthyroid") or an excess of hormones, usually secreted by the nodule, causing hyperthyroidism. When the thyroid function tests are normal, an ultrasound {{is often used to}} investigate the nodule, and provide information such as whether the nodule is fluid-filled or a solid mass, and whether the appearance is suggestive of a benign or malignant cancer. <b>A</b> <b>needle</b> aspiration biopsy may then be performed, and the sample undergoes cytology, in which the appearance of cells is viewed to determine whether they resemble normal or cancerous cells.|$|E

5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 1860s, the future writer was also {{pursuing}} an interest in politics, which eventually led him to rally with the more nationalist group within the Romanian liberal current, known as Free and Independent Faction. An agitator for his party, Creangă became commonly known under the nickname Popa Smântână ("Priest Sour Cream"). In April 1866, shortly after Domnitor Cuza was toppled by a coup, and just before Carol I was selected to replace him, the Romanian Army intervened to quell a separatist riot in Iași, instigated by Moldavian Metropolitan Calinic Miclescu. It is likely that Creangă shared the outlook of other Factionalists, according to which secession was preferable to Carol's rule, and was probably among the rioters. At around the same time, he began circulating antisemitic tracts, and is said to have demanded that Christians boycott Jewish business. He is thought to have coined the expression Nici un ac de la jidani ("Not even <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> from the kikes"). He was eventually selected as one of the Factionalist candidates for an Iași seat in the Romanian Deputies' Chamber, as documented by the memoirs of his conservative rival, Iacob Negruzzi. The episode is supposed to have taken place at the earliest during the 1871 suffrage.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) arrives at the hospital in San Diego where Scully introduces him to Emily. Mulder tells Scully that he had Melvin Frohike look into Emily's case: her surrogate mother is a woman named Anna Fugazzi (slang for fake), {{and there are no}} true records of how Emily came into the world. Mulder, along with Scully's family, attend a meeting regarding Emily's adoption at the San Diego Hall of Justice. Mulder tells the Judge that Emily was conceived from Scully's ova, which was taken from her during her abduction, which the Judge does not believe. Later, Scully receives a call from the County Children's Center that cuts off abruptly. She and Mulder head there, where they find Emily safe, but coming down with a fever. They find a greenish cyst on the back of Emily's neck. Later, when a nurse pierces the cyst with <b>a</b> <b>needle,</b> green liquid comes out, causing her to become gravely ill, yet Emily appears unaffected. Mulder believes that Emily has the same body chemistry that they have seen before with alien-human hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's case {{is brought}} to trial the {{following}} morning, {{with the assistance of}} the cobbler Richard Two-Shoes (Kaye). Elizabeth's daughter Sarah (Matthews) and son-in-law Thomas Nutter (Howick) testify that they have witnessed Elizabeth sucking from the teat of a furry creature, and speaking to a mouse (believed to be a demon). Elizabeth claims that Sarah and Thomas have falsely accused her, and want to be rid of her to make room in their house. George Waterhouse (Cooper) testifies against Elizabeth, and the accused is questioned. When others in the courtroom begin laughing at her responses, Warren declares that the next person to laugh will be executed as a witch. After an argument breaks out, the witch-finders and Pike decide that the rest of the trial should be conducted in private. Elizabeth is pricked with <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> to test her for the devil's mark. A remorseful Sarah tries to profess her mother's innocence, but Warren does not believe her. Elizabeth confesses that she has been prostituting herself to Two-Shoes, who wears a fur coat, but Two-Shoes denies this, and the trial is adjourned. Throughout proceedings, Warren is accusatory while Clarke is more cautious; Pike, meanwhile, is fascinated both by the lewd acts in which Elizabeth has supposedly engaged and by the witch-finders' torturous implements.|$|E
5000|$|Philosopher and {{historian}} Peter Harrison {{has suggested that}} the first reference to angels dancing on <b>a</b> <b>needle's</b> point occurs in an expository work by the English divine, William Sclater (1575-1626). In An exposition with notes vpon the first Epistle to the Thessalonians (1619), Sclater claimed that scholastic philosophers occupied themselves with such pointless questions as whether angels [...] "did occupie a place; and so, whether many might be in one place at one time; and how many might sit on <b>a</b> <b>Needles</b> point; and six hundred such like needlesse points." [...] Harrison proposes that the reason an English writer first introduced the [...] "needle’s point" [...] into a critique of medieval angelology is that it makes for a clever pun on [...] "needless point".|$|R
