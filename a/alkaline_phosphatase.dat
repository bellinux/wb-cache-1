5|$|Liver {{function}} {{tests can}} show {{a combination of}} results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised conjugated bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> levels). CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{blood tests}} show {{features}} of acute inflammation (raised {{white blood cell}} count and elevated C-reactive protein level), and usually abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). In most cases the LFTs will be consistent with obstruction: raised bilirubin, <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. In the early stages, however, pressure on the liver cells may be the main feature and the tests will resemble those in hepatitis, with elevations in alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase.|$|E
5|$|In nature, uranium(VI) forms highly soluble {{carbonate}} complexes at alkaline pH. This {{leads to}} an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards. However, it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline pH. A Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli.|$|E

25|$|Chemicals {{produce a}} wide variety of {{clinical}} and pathological hepatic injury. Biochemical markers (e.g. alanine transferase, <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> and bilirubin) are often used to indicate liver damage. Liver injury is defined as a rise in either (a) ALT level more than three times of upper limit of normal (ULN), (b) ALP level more than twice ULN, or (c) total bilirubin level more than twice ULN when associated with increased ALT or ALP. Liver damage is further characterized into hepatocellular (predominantly initial Alanine transferase elevation) and cholestatic (initial <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> rise) types.

40|$|In soil, {{bioavailable}} inorganic orthophosphate {{is found}} at low concentrations and thus limits biological growth. To overcome this phosphorus scarcity, plants and bacteria secrete numerous enzymes, namely acid and <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases,</b> which cleave orthophosphate from various organic phosphorus substrates. Using profile hidden Markov modeling approaches, we investigated {{the abundance of}} various non specific phosphatases, both acid and alkaline, in metagenomes retrieved from soils with contrasting pH regimes. This analysis uncovered a marked reduction in the abundance and diversity of various <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases</b> in low-pH soils that was not counterbalanced {{by an increase in}} acid phosphatases. Furthermore, it was also discovered that only half of the bacterial strains from different phyla deposited in the Integrated Microbial Genomes database harbor <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases.</b> Taken together, our data suggests that these ‘phosphatase lacking’ isolates likely increase in low-pH soils and future research should ascertain how these bacteria overcome phosphorus scarcity...|$|R

40|$|Electrophoretic {{isoenzyme}} separation provides {{much more}} precise information than measurement of <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases</b> (AP).

40|$|Cyanobacteria, {{as highly}} {{adaptable}} microorganisms, {{are characterized by}} an ability to survive in different environmental conditions, in which a significant role belongs to their enzymes. Phosphatases are enzymes produced by algae in relatively large quantities {{in response to a}} low orthophosphate concentration and their activity is significantly correlated with their primary production. The activity of these enzymes was investigated in 11 cyanobacterial strains in order to determine enzyme synthesis depending on taxonomic and ecological group of cyanobacteria. The study was conducted with 4 terrestrial cyanobacterial strains, which belong to Nostoc and Anabaena genera, and 7 filamentous water cyanobacteria of Nostoc, Oscillatoria, Phormidium and Microcystis genera. The obtained results showed that the activity of acid and <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases</b> strongly depended on cyanobacterial strain and the environment from which the strain originated. Higher activity of <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases,</b> ranging from 3. 64 to 85. 14 μmolpNP/s/dm 3, was recorded in terrestrial strains compared to the studied water strains (1. 11 - 5. 96 μmolpNP/s/dm 3). The activity of acid phosphatases was higher in most tested water strains (1. 67 - 6. 28 μmolpNP/s/dm 3) compared to the activity of <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases</b> (1. 11 - 5. 96 μmolpNP/s/dm 3). Comparing enzyme activity of nitrogen fixing and non-nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria, it was found that most nitrogen fixing strains had a higher activity of <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases.</b> The data obtained in this work indicate that activity of phosphatases is a strain specific property. The results further suggest that synthesis and activity of phosphatases depended on eco-physiological characteristics of the examined cyanobacterial strains. This can be of great importance for the further study of enzymes and mechanisms of their activity as a part of cyanobacterial survival strategy in environments with extreme conditions.
