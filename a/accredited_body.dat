5000|$|Within the European Union regulation, {{reference}} to intercountry adoption {{is made in}} article 4 of the Council Directive 2003/86/EC of 22 September 2003 {{on the right to}} family reunification. The article regulates the immigration of adoptive third-country-national children provided that the parents are established third country nationals within the European Union. EU Member States authorized the entry and residence of children adopted in accordance with a decision taken by the competent authority of the Member State concerned. Entry can also be authorized by a decision that is automatically enforceable due to international obligations of the Member State or must be recognized in accordance with international obligations (art. 4 (b)).With the ratification and adoption of the Hague Adoption Convention, European countries have developed training for social workers in charge of providing international adoption-related services. They have appointed competent specialists and created a centralized system of control (e.g. Italy and Germany). In Switzerland, on the other hand, the bureaucratization of the procedures has been considered to have slowed down the process resulting in a decrease of the number of children adopted. Traditionally in Spain, France and Switzerland, the adopting parents can choose between two paths to carry out international adoption: referring to the intermediation of an <b>accredited</b> <b>body</b> - most of the time a private organization - and with the supervision of the central adoption authority designated by the state, or opting for a private adoption without the referral to the intermediary. In Italy and Norway the second option, considered as [...] "private adoption", is forbidden. In Italy for example all international adoptions must be arranged by competent bodies accredited by national law. The only exception is granted to prospective adoptive couples where one spouse is a native of the country the child comes from, or for Italian families who have lived {{for a long time in}} the country and have a significant relation with its culture. In these two cases their demand for international adoption can be sent to the International Social Service, an international not-for-profit organization active in more than 100 countries through a network of branches, affiliated bureaus, and correspondents, without recurring to the accredited national bodies. France and Germany recently adopted a third path, creating public bodies that simultaneously exercise a formal intermediary role and in practice perform the functions of a central adoption authority. Data show that in all European countries, both those that legally prohibit and allow for it, the practice of private adoption is widespread and has raised concerns most of all in relation to the risk of child trafficking.Many European countries have signed bilateral agreement with countries of origin of the adopted children (e.g. Spain with Philippines and Bolivia, France with Vietnam). Legally speaking, bilateral agreements cannot disregard the guarantees provided by the Convention of the Rights of the Child and by the Hague Adoption Convention.|$|E

It {{has been argued}} that adequate pharmacy technician manpower is critical to pharmacy achieving its mission of pharmaceutical care and is also important in pharma-cy’s transition to medication therapy management (MTM) practices. 1, 2 Only recently, however, have re-searchers begun to examine technician manpower, fol-lowing calls to examine quality of work life, education, and training issues more closely. 3 A consensus on the definition of a pharmacy techni-cian remains elusive, as the definition varies by state, professional organization, and institution. State statutes and regulations are used often to characterize techni-cians ’ practice within the context of pharmacists ’ dis-pensing roles. 4 However, states vary on technician cre-dentialing protocols and terminology. Regulations of technicians employ terminology such as licensure, regis-tration, certification, and permit, with each state ascrib-ing its own meaning to these words. In a majority of cas-es, regardless of the terminology used, technicians are registered only with the state; however, in other cases, certification may mean explicit credentialing through an <b>accredited</b> <b>body.</b> 5 While there exists no consensus defini-tion of a pharmacy technician, a key similarity in many states ’ descriptions is that technicians do not use profes-sional judgment in their work activities. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) is {{a public}} health {{laboratory}} network consisting of 349 diagnostic pathology laboratories which employ approximately 4200 laboratory personnel. These laboratory workers (the majority of whom are females) may be exposed to various occupational health hazards {{during the course of}} their work, including chemical, physical, biological, ergonomic and psychosocial hazards. Some of these hazards may specifically affect the reproductive ability of both male and female workers. Study Objectives The aim {{of this study was to}} identify and assess, based on field observations, interviews and measurements, the risk to reproductive health from occupational health hazards (focusing on chemical hazards) that might be present in histopathology laboratories of the NHLS. It was expected that this study could sensitise, raise awareness and improve control strategies and procedures aimed at reducing reproductive health risks to both male and female workers in this particular work environment and in other NHLS laboratories. Materials and Methods This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study; the study population included five out of the fifteen existing NHLS histopathology laboratories in the country. Due to the limited time and resources available for this study four out of the five histopathology laboratories sampled were selected from the Gauteng Province (closest to the researcher) and an additional one from the Northern Cape Province. Results The reproductive health risk assessment process detailed in this report, has identified worker‟s exposure to formaldehyde during specimen cut-up, specimen storage and during the process of disposal and making up of formaldehyde solution, as potentially high risk. It also identified exposure to xylene vapours during the automated staining process (particularly when replacing chemicals in the equipment), as potentially high risk. Exposure to hazardous biological agents (HBAs) and various other chemical reagents, ergonomic stress and potential exposure to ionising radiation were identified as moderate reproductive health risks when performing specific histopathology laboratory processes. Discussion The outcome from the health risk assessment supported the conclusion from researchers reviewed in this study that reproductive health risks in the workplace warrant special consideration and exposure to specific hazards, such as organic solvents, might require the implementation of special measures to protect in particular, but not exclusively, pregnant workers. Some of the limitations related to this study include: limited research data on reproductive health and the difficulty of inferring from animal studies to human reproduction; another problem relates to the use of occupational exposure limits (OELs) as benchmark for acceptable or over-exposure, as OELs might be determined without sufficient consideration of reproductive health endpoints. Due to the limited scope of this study only the major chemical hazards identified (formaldehyde and organic solvents, including xylene) could be sampled. Recommendations Protection of laboratory workers from reproductive health hazards should follow the standard occupational hygiene hierarchy of control practice, i. e. substitution and engineering methods should get precedence over strategies that rely on personal protective equipment. Although the substitution of hazardous substances such as formaldehyde and xylene in pathology laboratories appears possible, the health and safety implications of using substitutes must be investigated carefully. Following observations made during this study it was recommended that local exhaust ventilation (LEV) systems should be maintained in good working order and their performance routinely tested, both by workers and by an external <b>accredited</b> <b>body.</b> Administrative measures which may include work restrictions and worker transfer should be implemented with caution, and always after thorough consultation with the individual worker. Such measures, when implemented, should be activated even before pregnancy is confirmed to prevent exposure during the crucial period of early foetal growth. It was recommended that the NHLS review the current policy and safe working procedure on pregnancy to include both male and female workers within reproductive age. In terms of personal protective equipment, it was recommended that when potential short-term, high exposure to formaldehyde or xylene is anticipated a half-mask respirator with the appropriate filtering media is applied. Workers must be adequately trained and fit tested to ensure that maximum protection is achieved. Additional information, more research data and detailed survey measurements will be required to substantiate the results of this assessment. In the meantime, the precautionary approach and best control practices should apply, to provide the maximum feasible protection for both males and female laboratory workers in their reproductive age...|$|E
