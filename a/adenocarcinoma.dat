5|$|Nearly 40% of lung cancers are <b>adenocarcinoma,</b> {{which usually}} {{originates}} in peripheral lung tissue. Although most cases of <b>adenocarcinoma</b> {{are associated with}} smoking, <b>adenocarcinoma</b> {{is also the most}} common form of lung cancer among people who have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes ("never-smokers") and ex-smokers with a modest smoking history. A subtype of <b>adenocarcinoma,</b> the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, is more common in female never-smokers, and may have a better long-term survival.|$|E
5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung <b>adenocarcinoma</b> started to rise {{relative}} to other types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where <b>adenocarcinoma</b> tends to arise. The incidence of lung <b>adenocarcinoma</b> continues to rise.|$|E

Pathologic examination of resected pancreaticoduodenectomy specimens reveal that 40 – 60  % are <b>adenocarcinomas</b> {{of the head of}} the pancreas, 10 – 20  % are <b>adenocarcinomas</b> of the ampulla of Vater, 10  % are distal bile duct <b>adenocarcinomas,</b> and 5 – 10  % are duodenal <b>adenocarcinomas</b> [1].|$|R
5|$|At least 50% {{of people}} with {{pancreatic}} <b>adenocarcinoma</b> have diabetes {{at the time of}} diagnosis. While long-standing diabetes is a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer (see Risk factors), the cancer can itself cause diabetes, in which case recent onset of diabetes could be considered an early sign of the disease. People over 50 who develop diabetes have eight times the usual risk of developing pancreatic <b>adenocarcinoma</b> within three years, after which the relative risk declines.|$|E

5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is a {{relatively}} rare neoplasm that is classified as an <b>adenocarcinoma</b> (a cancer that forms glands or secretes significant amounts of mucins). It has an annual incidence rate of 1–2 cases per 100,000 in the Western world, but rates of cholangiocarcinoma have been rising worldwide {{over the past few}} decades.|$|E
5|$|In endometrioid <b>adenocarcinoma,</b> {{the cancer}} cells grow in {{patterns}} reminiscent of normal endometrium, with many new glands formed from columnar epithelium with some abnormal nuclei. Low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have well differentiated cells, have not invaded the myometrium, and are seen alongside endometrial hyperplasia. The tumor's glands form very close together, without the stromal tissue that normally separates them. Higher-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have less well-differentiated cells, have more solid sheets of tumor cells no longer organized into glands, and {{are associated with}} an atrophied endometrium. There are several subtypes of endometrioid <b>adenocarcinoma</b> with similar prognoses, including villoglandular, secretory, and ciliated cell variants. There is also a subtype characterized by squamous differentiation. Some endometrioid adenocarcinomas have foci of mucinous carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Mucinous carcinomas are a rare form of endometrial cancer, {{making up}} less than 1–2% of all {{diagnosed}} endometrial cancer. Mucinous endometrial carcinomas are most often stage I and grade I, giving them a good prognosis.

40|$|Point {{mutations}} in codon 12 of the K-ras protooncogene occur {{more frequently in}} lung <b>adenocarcinomas</b> from smokers (30 %) {{than they do in}} lung <b>adenocarcinomas</b> from nonsmokers (7 %), suggesting that smoking {{is an important factor in}} the induction of these mutations. The lack of well defined "early" premalignant or in situ glandular neoplasms of the lung, however, has not permitted direct evaluation of the chronology of ras activation in the development of lung <b>adenocarcinomas.</b> To circumvent the need to evaluate precursor lesions, we examined lung <b>adenocarcinomas</b> from former smokers for point {{mutations in}} K-ras. Mutations in codon 12 of K-ras were detected using polymerase chain reaction amplification and mutation-specific oligonucleotide probes. The types and frequencies of mutations found in <b>adenocarcinomas</b> obtained from 57 former smokers were compared to those found in 27 <b>adenocarcinomas</b> from patients who never smoked and to those found in 27 <b>adenocarcinomas</b> from patients who were current smokers. The overall prevalence of K-ras point mutations in lung <b>adenocarcinomas</b> obtained from former smokers (32 %) was not different from that seen in <b>adenocarcinomas</b> from patients who were current smokers (30 %, P = 0. 83), and was greater than that seen in <b>adenocarcinomas</b> from patients who never smoked (7 %, P = 0. 015). This pattern was independent of the duration of abstinence from smoking. Furthermore, the predominant type of mutation found in tumors from former smokers was a guanine-to-thymine transversion, the specific type of mutation induced by benzo(a) pyrene, one of the chemical carcinogens found in tobacco smoke. These findings support previous findings that suggest that codon 12 of the K-ras oncogene may be a specific target of the mutagenic activity of tobacco smoke, and suggest that DNA alterations at this site can occur early and irreversibly during the development of <b>adenocarcinomas</b> of the lun...|$|R
40|$|Expression of E-cadherin in 21 {{patients}} with various histological types of gastric carcinomas was studied by immunoperoxidase staining. Intercellular boundaries {{of almost all}} cancer cells in well and moderately differentiated <b>adenocarcinomas</b> stained as deeply for E-cadherin as normal gastric mucosa. However, singly infiltrating cells of those histological types were poorly stained. In poorly differentiated <b>adenocarcinomas,</b> cancer cells forming clusters stained lightly and those infiltrating singly stained even less. In signet ring cell carcinomas, hardly any staining was observed. In each histological type, the staining patterns and intensity at different layers of the gastric wall, were essentially the same. Cancer cells from carcinomatous ascites of gastric <b>adenocarcinomas</b> and pancreatic <b>adenocarcinomas,</b> and those from pleural effusion of lung <b>adenocarcinomas</b> were also studied by immunofluorescence staining. Of 11 specimens, ten were negative and only one from a lung <b>adenocarcinomas</b> was positively stained. By phase-contrast microscopic observations, none of these cancer cells including those from the lung <b>adenocarcinomas,</b> formed obvious cell-cell contacts. Cell aggregation assays confirmed the above results. The molecular weight of E-cadherin of cancer cells of lung <b>adenocarcinomas</b> was less than intact E-cadherin as revealed by Western blot analysis. These results suggest that depressed expression and/or impaired function of E-cadherin in cancer cells, facilitates their liberation from primary sites to infiltrate freely into tissue or fluid...|$|R
5|$|The {{spread of}} {{pancreatic}} cancer to other organs (metastasis) may also cause symptoms. Typically, pancreatic <b>adenocarcinoma</b> first spreads to nearby lymph nodes, {{and later to}} the liver or to the peritoneal cavity, large intestine or lungs. It is uncommon for it to spread to the bones or brain.|$|E
5|$|Vaginal {{bleeding}} or spotting {{in women}} after menopause occurs in 90% of endometrial cancer. Bleeding is especially common with <b>adenocarcinoma,</b> occurring in {{two-thirds of all}} cases. Abnormal menstrual cycles or extremely long, heavy, or frequent episodes of bleeding in women before menopause {{may also be a}} sign of endometrial cancer.|$|E
5|$|For locally {{advanced}} and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas, which together represent over 80% of cases, numerous recent trials comparing chemotherapy regimes have shown increased survival times, {{but not to}} more than one year. Overall five-year survival for pancreatic cancer in the US has improved from 2% in cases diagnosed in 1975–77, and 4% in 1987–89 diagnoses, to 6% in 2003–09. In the less than 20% of cases of pancreatic <b>adenocarcinoma</b> with a diagnosis of a localized and small cancerous growth (less than 2cm in Stage T1), about 20% of Americans survive to five years.|$|E
40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody designated RWP 1. 1 was produced against a human pancreatic carcinoma cell line RWP 1. This antibody {{was shown to}} recognize an epitope of carcinoembryonic antigen. The reactivity of the antibody was evaluated on formalin-fixed normal tissues, 86 malignant neoplasms, 10 colonic polyps, and 6 cases of chronic pancreatitis using the peroxidase anti-peroxidase technique. RWP 1. 1 did not react with normal tissues apart from weak staining of fetal pancreatic ducts. This antibody preferentially reacted with primary and metastatic <b>adenocarcinomas</b> of the colon, stomach, pancreas, and colonic polyps but not with most <b>adenocarcinomas</b> from other sites nor {{with other types of}} tumors or cases of chronic pancreatitis. It also reacted with colon <b>adenocarcinomas</b> on frozen sections.

40|$|Background: Incidence {{rates for}} <b>adenocarcinomas</b> of the {{esophagus}} and gastric cardia have risen steeply {{over the last}} few decades.

Methods: The study included 554 subjects newly di-agnosed with esophageal or gastric cardia <b>adenocarcinomas,</b> 589 subjects newly diagnosed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma or other gastric <b>adenocarcinomas,</b> and 695 con-trol subjects. Estimates of risk (odds ratios [ORs] and cor-responding 95 % confidence intervals [CIs]) were calculated for the four tumor types separately and for esophageal and gastric cardia <b>adenocarcinomas</b> combined. Results: Risk of esophageal and gastric cardia <b>adenocarcinomas</b> combined was increased among current cigarette smokers (OR = 2. 4; 95 % = 1. 7 – 3. 4), with little reduction observed until 30 year...|$|R
40|$|Carcinogen-induced primary {{intestinal}} <b>adenocarcinomas</b> {{serve as}} a useful animal model for human colonic <b>adenocarcinomas.</b> Although striking similarities between this model and the human disease state exist, there are also troublesome discrepancies-a major one being the reported lack of an adenoma-carcinoma sequence in the experimental model. However, the original morphologic descriptions of these experimental neoplasms predated the development of presently accepted morphologic criteria {{that have been used}} to describe the adenoma-carcinoma sequence in humans. Therefore, the authors reevaluated the structural evolution of dimethylhydrazine-induced rat intestinal neoplasms, using the same criteria that were recently applied to evaluate human colonic <b>adenocarcinomas.</b> Such an approach shows that many dimethylhydrazine-induced intestinal <b>adenocarcinomas</b> have peripheral foci of adenomatous epithelium associated with them. In addition, the frequency of this association correlates inversely (P less than. 001) with the depth of invasion. These findings are comparable to those which, in humans, have been used as evidence supporting the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Thus, when assessed with equivalent criteria, dimethylhydrazine-induced intestinal <b>adenocarcinomas</b> appear to be similar, not dissimilar, to human colonic <b>adenocarcinomas</b> in their structural evolution. These data suggest that, at least in part, dimethylhydrazine-induced intestinal <b>adenocarcinomas</b> arise in foci of preexisting adenomatous epithelium...|$|R
5|$|Liver {{function}} {{tests can}} show {{a combination of}} results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised conjugated bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase levels). CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic <b>adenocarcinoma,</b> and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Although cholangiocarcinoma {{is known}} to have the {{histological}} and molecular features of an <b>adenocarcinoma</b> of epithelial cells lining the biliary tract, the actual cell of origin is unknown. Recent evidence has suggested that the initial transformed cell that generates the primary tumor may arise from a pluripotent hepatic stem cell. Cholangiocarcinoma is thought to develop through a series of stages - from early hyperplasia and metaplasia, through dysplasia, to the development of frank carcinoma - in a process similar to that seen in the development of colon cancer. Chronic inflammation and obstruction of the bile ducts, and the resulting impaired bile flow, are thought {{to play a role in}} this progression.|$|E
5|$|Development of an endometrial {{hyperplasia}} (overgrowth of endometrial cells) is {{a significant}} risk factor because hyperplasias can and often do develop into <b>adenocarcinoma,</b> though cancer can develop without {{the presence of a}} hyperplasia. Within ten years, 8–30% of atypical endometrial hyperplasias develop into cancer, whereas 1–3% of non-atypical hyperplasias do so. An atypical hyperplasia is one with visible abnormalities in the nuclei. Pre-cancerous endometrial hyperplasias are also referred to as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. Mutations in the KRAS gene can cause endometrial hyperplasia and therefore Type I endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia typically occurs after the age of 40. Endometrial glandular dysplasia occurs with an overexpression of p53, and develops into a serous carcinoma.|$|E
40|$|Despite major {{advances}} in the differential diagnosis of mesotheliomas versus <b>adenocarcinomas,</b> a certain percentage defy diagnosis. Several markers such as keratin, carcinoembryonic antigen, Leu-M 1, milk fat globulin, and antibody against tumor-associated glycoprotein Tag- 72 (B 72. 3) {{have been used to}} distinguish them. In this study, blood group antigens, namely Lewisx and Lewisy, known to be expressed in a number of <b>adenocarcinomas</b> of diverse origin were used in the differential diagnosis of 30 samples from 18 mesotheliomas and 18 primary lung <b>adenocarcinomas.</b> <b>Adenocarcinomas</b> showed strong diffuse homogeneous staining, membranous staining, or both for Lewisy in 100 % of cases irrespective of differentiation. Lewisx was expressed in 78 % of <b>adenocarcinomas</b> with a wide variation in distribution of staining. Mesotheliomas did not show the diffuse homogeneous staining pattern but showed a markedly distinctive granular staining in the cytoplasm of rare cells in 23 % of Lewisy and 20 % of Lewisx cases, which was interpreted as negative. In conclusion, Lewisy is a sensitive marker for <b>adenocarcinomas</b> in that it stains 100 % of cases and is a specific marker in the differential diagnosis of mesotheliomas and <b>adenocarcinomas...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 2015, {{pancreatic}} cancers of {{all types}} resulted in 411,600 deaths globally. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth {{most common cause of}} death from cancer in the United Kingdom, and the fourth most common in the United States. The disease occurs most often in the developed world, where about 70% of the new cases in 2012 originated. Pancreatic <b>adenocarcinoma</b> typically has a very poor prognosis: after diagnosis, 25% of people survive one year and 5% live for five years. For cancers diagnosed early, the five-year survival rate rises to about 20%. Neuroendocrine cancers have better outcomes; at five years from diagnosis, 65% of those diagnosed are living, though survival varies considerably {{depending on the type of}} tumor.|$|E
5|$|Pancreatic cancer rarely occurs {{before the}} age of 40, {{and more than half of}} cases of {{pancreatic}} <b>adenocarcinoma</b> occur in those over 70. Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes, and certain rare genetic conditions. About 25% of cases are linked to smoking, and 5–10% are linked to inherited genes. Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed by a combination of medical imaging techniques such as ultrasound or computed tomography, blood tests, and examination of tissue samples (biopsy). The disease is divided into stages, from early (stageI) to late (stageIV). Screening the general population has not been found to be effective.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{developing}} pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of red or processed meat. A smoker's chance {{of developing}} the disease decreases if they stop smoking, and almost returns {{to that of the}} rest of the population after 20years. Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care, or a combination of these. Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure pancreatic <b>adenocarcinoma,</b> and may also be done to improve quality of life without the potential for cure. Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed. Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{involved in}} the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer are poorly understood, but evidence suggests that aberrant activation of Wnt/?-catenin signalling pathway {{plays a significant role}} in this malignancy. However, the molecular defects that contribute to the activation of this pathway have not been elucidated. Frequently rearranged in advanced T-cell lymphomas- 1 (FRAT 1) is a candidate for the regulation of cytoplasmic ?-catenin. In this study, we developed in situ hybridisation probes to evaluate the presence of FRAT 1 and used an anti-?-catenin antibody to evaluate by immunohistochemistry the expression levels and subcellular localisation of ?-catenin in ovarian cancer tissue microarrays. Expression of FRAT 1 was found in some human normal tissues and 47 % of ovarian <b>adenocarcinomas.</b> A total of 46 % of ovarian serous <b>adenocarcinomas</b> were positive for FRAT 1 expression. Accumulation of ?-catenin in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm was observed in 55 % ovarian <b>adenocarcinomas</b> and in 59 % of serous <b>adenocarcinomas.</b> A significant association was observed in ovarian serous <b>adenocarcinomas</b> between FRAT 1 and ?-catenin expression (P< 0. 01).

40|$|Expression of {{pancreatic}} trypsinogen and cathepsin B in 23 surgically resected pancreatic ductal <b>adenocarcinomas</b> {{was evaluated}} immunohistochemically, using a monoclonal antibody against human pancreatic trypsinogen and a polyclonal antibody against human cathepsin B. Fifteen of 20 invasive tubular <b>adenocarcinomas</b> (75 %) expressed pancreatic trypsinogen in a coarse granular pattern {{located in the}} supranuclear cytoplasm of the carcinoma cells. In addition, metastatic lesions, including those in peripancreatic lymph nodes and neural plexuses, expressed pancreatic trypsinogen. In contrast, three intraductal (non-invasive) papillary <b>adenocarcinomas</b> did not express pancreatic trypsinogen. Cathepsin B expression was recognised in 14 of 20 invasive tubular <b>adenocarcinomas</b> (70 %) in a fine granular pattern located diffusely in the cytoplasm of the carcinoma cells, while {{none of the three}} intraductal papillary <b>adenocarcinomas</b> had detectable cathepsin B. These findings suggest that pancreatic invasive ductal <b>adenocarcinomas</b> express pancreatic trypsinogen and cathepsin B immunoreactive peptides, raising the possibility that pancreatic trypsinogen and cathepsin B may act independently of each other in the process of carcinoma invasion and metastasis, like other different classes of proteases involved in the proteolytic modification of the matrix barrier...|$|R
