5|$|A design {{competition}} {{was announced in}} July 1911, but there were not many contenders. The Naval Ministry favored the design from the Russud Works and gave preliminary orders for three ships on 2 September, even before the competition was concluded in November. Russud's design was unsurprisingly selected and the government transferred designers from the government-owned Baltic Works as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> set of drawings for the Gangut-class {{to speed up the}} detailed design process.|$|E

5|$|The Ju 87 {{was fitted}} with {{detachable}} hatches and removable coverings to aid and ease maintenance and overhaul. The designers avoided welding parts wherever possible, preferring moulded and cast parts instead. Large airframe segments were interchangeable <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> unit, which increased speed of repair.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} {{environmental damage}} {{that resulted from}} usage of the herbicide prompted the United Nations to pass Resolution 31/72 and ratify the Environmental Modification Convention.

5|$|The {{shedding}} {{of scales}} is called ecdysis, or, in normal usage moulting or sloughing. In {{the case of}} snakes, the complete outer layer of skin is shed in one layer. Snake scales are not discrete but extensions of the epidermis hence they are not shed separately, but are ejected <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> contiguous outer layer of skin during each moult, akin to a sock being turned inside out.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> normed space, Hilbert {{spaces are}} by {{definition}} also Banach spaces. As such they are topological vector spaces, in which topological notions like the openness and closedness of subsets are well-defined. Of special importance {{is the notion}} of a closed linear subspace of a Hilbert space that, with the inner product induced by restriction, is also complete (being a closed set in a complete metric space) and therefore a Hilbert space in its own right.|$|E
5|$|Edge {{returned}} on the September 9, 2013, {{episode of}} Raw {{in his hometown}} of Toronto where he hosted his talk show The Cutting Edge having Daniel Bryan as his special guest after Randy Orton was scheduled to be his original guest. Edge insulted Triple H in the segment, who retaliated by labeling Edge's main event push <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> failure and sending The Shield to attack Edge's friend Christian. When Edge went to confront Triple H, he was escorted from the building. Edge hosted The Cutting Edge on the September 13 episode of SmackDown, where he mocked Randy Orton and watched as Orton's attack on Bryan backfired.|$|E

5|$|For the North Vietnamese, the Route 9 – Southern Laos Victory, {{was viewed}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> success. The {{military}} {{expansion of the}} Ho Chi Minh Trail to the west which had begun in 1970 {{at the expense of}} Laotian forces, was quickly accelerated. Laotian troops were soon withdrawing toward the Mekong River and a logistical artery 60 miles in width was soon expanded to 90 miles. Another result of the operation was a firm decision by the Politburo to launch a major conventional invasion of South Vietnam in early 1972, paving the way for the Nguyễn Huệ Offensive, known in the west as the Easter Offensive.|$|E
5|$|Many fans of {{the show}} were outraged when Mercedes was {{supposedly}} murdered by Freddie Roscoe in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel died in a train crash. However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's departure is totally shrouded in mystery. Running up to the week where she exits, she has really annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'. The story line was billed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> mystery, as the viewers don't completely know what happened between Mercedes and her killer on {{the night at the}} McQueen house, or whether or not she was actually dead.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{was also}} {{interested}} in applying his theory of colour perception, namely in colour photography. Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced {{with a set of}} three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through red, green and blue filters and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by the human eye <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> reproduction of all the colours in the scene.|$|E

5|$|With the British 6th Airborne Division still {{refitting}} after Operation Tonga, and {{the subsequent}} fighting in Normandy, the task of securing the Rhine Bridgehead fell to the 1st Airborne Division {{under the command of}} Major-General Roy Urquhart. The division was made up of three brigades of infantry (two parachute, one glider borne), supporting artillery and anti-tank batteries and substantial Royal Engineer units, as well as supporting elements such as Royal Army Service Corps and Royal Army Medical Corps units. Most of the division had seen action in North Africa and Sicily, particularly the 1st Parachute Brigade and 1st Airlanding Brigade. However, {{this was the first time}} the division had fought together <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> formation.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{had been}} formed in October 1941, the British 1st Airborne Division, {{commanded}} by Major-General George Hopkinson, had never before fought <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> division. The only units with any combat experience were the 1st Parachute Brigade, which had fought with distinction as an independent brigade in North Africa and in Operation Fustian during the Allied invasion of Sicily, and the 1st Airlanding Brigade, understrength with only two battalions, which had also fought in Sicily during Operation Ladbroke. Both brigades had suffered heavy casualties in Sicily and were in no condition to undertake any further assault landings. Of the division's other brigades, the 2nd and 4th Para Brigades, were untried in battle. Also, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was the only full strength unit, as the 4th Parachute Brigade had only two battalions, with its third battalion still forming in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|As winter passed, in {{an effort}} to shorten their lines and move into {{prepared}} positions, the Germans fell back towards the Hindenburg Line. After the Allies advanced to follow up the withdrawal, the battalion fought its first major battle of 1917 in early April, around Bullecourt, where the 4th Brigade attacked <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> formation {{for the first time since}} Gallipoli. Committed without the protection of an artillery barrage, expecting tank support to win the day, the 4th Brigade suffered heavy casualties; on the first night, the tanks broke down and on the second, they had proven unable to breach the enemy defences, leaving the infantry to force their way through. After less than 10 hours of fighting, 2,339 soldiers from the 4th lay dead or wounded, out of 3,000 committed, including 400 from the 15th; by the end of the attack, only 52 men from the battalion's assault force remained uninjured. They were subsequently withdrawn from the line back to farmland around the village of Doulien where the battalion was rebuilt, eventually reaching a strength of 719 personnel of all ranks.|$|E
5|$|Following its May 1943 {{debut in}} action, {{during the second}} half of 1943, Schnaufer and his crew began experimenting with {{upward-firing}} autocannons, dubbed Schräge Musik. This allowed the night fighter to approach and attack the bombers from below—outside the enemy crew's usual field of view. An attack by a Schräge Musik-equipped night fighter typically came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> surprise to the bomber crew, who realised a night fighter was close by only when they came under fire. It is not exactly known when Schnaufer's Bf 110 was equipped with Schräge Musik. Rumpelhardt stated that the weapons system was installed prior to his return from officer training. It is also not exactly known how many of his victories had been claimed using the upwards firing cannons. According to Fritz Engau, who had known Schnaufer since Flugzeugführerschule C 3, 20 to 30 of Schnaufer's aerial victories had been claimed using upwards firing guns.|$|E
5|$|Having {{made the}} journey to Egypt {{travelling}} via South Africa and the Red Sea due {{to the threat of}} attack that was present in the Mediterranean, the battalion arrived just before New Years. The 18th Brigade was again reassigned in February 1941, this time to the 7th Division, with whom they would see out the remainder of the war; at the same time, the brigade was converted from a four-battalion structure to three, and the 2/11th was transferred to help form the 19th Brigade. On 21 March 1941, the battalion undertook its first ground action of the war, when one of its companies– 'D' Company– supported the 2/9th Battalion in their attack on the Italian held fort at Giarabub. The battalion's first major action <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> unit did not come until April 1941, though, when it undertook defensive actions during the Siege of Tobruk. During the Battle of the Salient, fought in early May, the 2/10th took over a position on the northern flank of the perimeter, relieving the 2/48th Battalion, coming under heavy air attack during the handover.|$|E
