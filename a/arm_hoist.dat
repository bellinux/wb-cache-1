At center, two men stand near two narrow palates, {{watching}} a crane <b>arm</b> <b>hoist</b> {{a stack of}} boxes full of Sil-O-Cel insulation brick. In the background, a large ship can be seen, {{the first in a}} line of several that extend backward into the left distance. Writing on the boxes reads "This side up. Handle with care. Use no hooks". The bricks were manufactured by the Johns Manville Corporation...|$|E

60|$|Momentarily stunned, Gahan's fingers {{slipped from}} their hold upon the cordage {{and the man}} shot {{downward}} through the thin air of dying Mars toward the ground three thousand feet beneath, while upon {{the deck of the}} rolling Vanator his faithful warriors clung to their lashings all unconscious of the fate of their beloved leader; nor was it until more than an hour later, after the storm had materially subsided, that they realized he was lost, or knew the self-sacrificing heroism of the act that had sealed his doom. The Vanator now rested upon an even keel as she was carried along by a strong, though steady, wind. The warriors had cast off their deck lashings and the officers were taking account of losses and damage when a weak cry was heard from oversides, attracting their attention to the man hanging in the cordage beneath the keel. Strong <b>arms</b> <b>hoisted</b> him to the deck and then it was that the crew of the Vanator learned of the heroism of their jed and his end. How far they had traveled since his loss they could only vaguely guess, nor could they return in search of him in the disabled condition of the ship. It was a saddened company that drifted onward through the air toward whatever destination Fate was to choose for them.|$|R
5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot <b>arm</b> to <b>hoist</b> the docking module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within five inches of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.|$|R
50|$|Sunflower sea stars can {{reproduce}} either asexually through fissiparity or sexually through broadcast spawning. They {{also have}} separate sexes. Sunflower sea stars breed from May through June. In preparing to spawn, they arch up using {{a dozen or}} so <b>arms</b> to <b>hoist</b> their fleshy central mass free of the seafloor and release gametes into the water for external fertilization. The microscopic sea star larvae float and feed near the surface for 2 to 10 weeks. After the planktonic larval period, the larvae settle to the bottom and transform into juveniles. Juvenile sunflower sea stars begin life with five arms, and grow the rest as they mature. The lifespans of most sunflower sea stars is three to five years.|$|R
30|$|In an experiment, {{operators}} controlled {{a mobile}} robot by steering to trace reference lines. However, in our construction machine, operators {{control on the}} basis of a work plan without a detailed reference trajectory. Operators have common actions, e.g., excavation and manipulation of a <b>hoist</b> <b>arm.</b> Operators change these actions according to the work target, habitual actions, and work progress. In particular, in teleoperation, it is difficult for operators to control the tip of a construction machine in three-dimensional space without perspective.|$|R
40|$|A payload lifter/manipulator module {{includes}} a rotatable joint supporting spreader arms angularly spaced {{with respect to}} one another. A rigid arm is fixedly coupled to the joint and extends out therefrom to a tip. A tension arm has a first end and a second end with the first end being fixedly coupled {{to the tip of}} the rigid arm. The tension arm incorporates pivots along the length thereof. Each pivot can be engaged by or disengaged from the outboard end of a spreader arm based on a position of the spreader <b>arm.</b> A <b>hoist,</b> positioned remotely with respect to the module and coupled to the second end of the tension arm, controls the position of the spreader arms to thereby control the position of the rigid arm's tip. Payload lifter/manipulator assemblies can be constructed with {{one or more of the}} modules...|$|R
50|$|The first actions {{involving}} the Me 163B in regular Luftwaffe active service occurred on 28 July 1944, from I./JG 400's base at Brandis, when two USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress were attacked without confirmed kills. Combat operations continued from May 1944 to spring 1945. During this time, {{there were nine}} confirmed kills with 14 Me 163s lost. Feldwebel Siegfried Schubert was the most successful pilot, with three bombers to his credit. Allied fighter pilots soon noted the short duration of the powered flight. They would wait and, when the engine exhausted its propellant, pounce on the unpowered Komet. However, the Komet was extremely manoeuvrable in gliding flight. Another Allied method was to attack the fields the Komets operated from and strafe them after the Me 163s landed. Due to the skid-based landing gear system, the Komet was immobile until the Scheuch-Schlepper tractor could back the trailer up to {{the nose of the}} aircraft, place its two rear arms under the wing panels, and jack up the trailer's <b>arms</b> to <b>hoist</b> the aircraft off the ground or place it back on its take-off dolly to tow it back to its maintenance area.|$|R
2500|$|John Warr, {{with whom}} Trueman shared his {{first-class}} debut, wrote {{that from the}} beginning of his career, Trueman's run-up was [...] "curving and long but nicely modulated". David Frith continued with Trueman reaching the wicket, where he turned his body side-on and cocked back his ball-carrying right arm, as the leading left <b>arm</b> was <b>hoisted,</b> before [...] "an awesome cartwheel" [...] sent him into a followthrough which [...] "resembled a Sea Fury finishing its mission along the runway of an aircraft carrier". Warr said Trueman's final stride had a [...] "pronounced drag" [...] which caused him some difficulties when the front-foot rule was introduced. His bowling arm was kept high through the delivery stride, to generate extra bounce and pace off the pitch, and the movement of the ball was [...] "predominantly away from the bat" [...] (i.e., the out-swinger). Trueman himself maintained that his ability to bowl outswingers consistently was [...] "another new ingredient I brought to the county game". As Maurice Leyland said to him: [...] "Keep bowling those outswingers, Fred, and you'll be all right. That's the one that gets the great batsmen out!" [...] Trueman acknowledged that other great fast bowlers who could bowl the outswinger well were Ray Lindwall and Wes Hall; but Brian Statham and Frank Tyson could not.|$|R
50|$|These {{guns were}} of {{built-up}} construction with a fixed liner, autofretted barrel, and a Welin breech block. The gun mounts had electrically powered training, elevation, hoists and rammers. There was no swinging <b>arm,</b> and shell <b>hoists</b> were of pusher type with loading at +15Â°. These guns suffered from dispersion problems (due to the turret {{design of the}} Trento-class cruisers), so the original muzzle velocity of 905 m/s was reduced to 840 m/s for armor-piercing shells. Shell weight was also reduced from 125.3 kg to 118 kg {{in an attempt to}} resolve these problems, but these efforts were only partially successful. The main reason for the dispersion problem was because the guns were mounted too close together on a common cradle, which together with a narrow 4.52 m ball track complicated loading of the guns.|$|R
500|$|The Olympic Flag {{was carried}} by eight people chosen {{from around the}} world to embody the Olympic values: Ban Ki-moon (as UN general secretary), Sally Becker (for courage), Doreen Lawrence (chosen for her [...] "tireless thirst for justice"), Haile Gebrselassie (for his [...] "fight against poverty"), Leymah Gbowee (as [...] "a great peacemaker"), Shami Chakrabarti (for [...] "her integrity"), Daniel Barenboim (for {{bringing}} [...] "harmony in place of discord"), and Marina Silva (as UN Champion of the Earth). [...] The flag paused in front of Muhammad Ali (invited to represent 'respect, confidence, conviction, dedication, generosity and spiritual strength'), who held it for a few moments. Ali, who had lit the flame at the 1996 Atlanta Games, was accompanied by his wife Lonnie and appeared frail. The flag was received by a colour guard of Her Majesty's <b>Armed</b> Forces and <b>hoisted</b> to the Olympic Hymn, performed by the LSO and the Grimethorpe Colliery Band. The Olympic Oaths were taken by taekwondo athlete Sarah Stevenson on behalf of the athletes, by British AIBA Referee Mik Basi on behalf of the officials, and by Eric Farrell on behalf of the coaches.|$|R
