40|$|According to {{self-monitoring}} theory, high self-monitors {{should be}} more skilled at self-presentation than low self-monitors. Research has shown that high self-monitors do possess skills ostensibly related to self-presentation, {{but there is no}} empirical evidence that they are any better at achieving self-presentation goals. Conversely, the selfpresentation literature has identified self-presentation strategies that do facilitate achieving interpersonal goals. One component of self-presentation skill, therefore, may involve knowing what strategy to use in achieving self-presentation success. This research examines the self-presentation strategies used by high and low self-monitors in their attempt to achieve the goal of being liked. Previous research has found that presenting one's positive interpersonal qualities tend to increase liking, whereas presenting one's <b>abilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>achievements</b> tend to reduce liking. It was hypothesized that when faced with the goal of being liked, high selfmonitors, more so than low self-monitors, would choose to emphasize their positive interpersonal qualities and to be modest in presenting their achievements. It was hypothesized further that the selection of self-presentation strategies would have actual interpersonal consequences. It was predicted that the presentation of positive interpersonal qualities would increase liking, whereas the promotion of <b>abilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>achievements</b> would decrease liking. Three studies were conducted to test these hypotheses. In two studies, high and low self-monitoring participants fabricated personality descriptions they believed another person would like very much. Contrary to prediction, high self-monitors promoted <b>abilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>achievements</b> more extensively than low self-monitors. In a third study designed to examine self-monitors' expectations regarding different self-presentation strategies, high self-monitors believed that promoting abilities would lead to greater liking than did low self-monitors. Results indicated that presentations that extolled interpersonal qualities did produce greater liking than did presentations that extolled <b>achievements</b> <b>and</b> <b>abilities.</b> Thus, high self-monitors did not use the self-presentational strategy that was more likely to succeed.
