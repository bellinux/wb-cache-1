25|$|Standing at the North Kamloops station, {{the train}} is {{actually}} facing north and will be travelling north, {{at least in a}} northerly direction, for <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> six hours. The train follows the North Thompson River for much of the way, crossing it several times. The scenery changes gradually from the dry, rolling plateau – though miles of irrigation soften the starkness – to the lusher, evergreen forests farther north. Narrow valleys bordered by mountains on both sides feature farmlands, pastures, forests, logging camps, and small communities. Clearwater and Blue River are two such communities where the Canadian has flag stops. Near Clearwater, the train crosses the Clearwater River. The Monashee Mountains lie to the east for much of the way to Valemount.|$|E
25|$|The {{merits of}} the {{allegations}} are impossible to judge, although {{it seems clear that}} Archer was acquainted with Cahill. The assassination plot was just one of many against the queen that received credence during the final decade of her reign. One sceptic has pointed out that the evidence only emerged once Father Robert Persons had published his A Conference <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Next</b> Succession to the Crown of England. The book does appear to have alarmed Elizabeth's advisers, and from that date onward the flow of supposed plots against the queen's life became steady. In 1601 Cecil himself was accused of treason at the trial of the Earl of Essex {{on the basis of his}} reading of Person's book, but survived this twist and went on to secure the succession of James I upon the queen's death two years later.|$|E

25|$|At {{this point}} William {{died and the}} land {{together}} with, the almost complete mansion, Syerston Hall, were inherited by his son George Fillingham (1774–1850). One of his first tasks was to arrange for the Award of the parliamentary commissioners {{to be put into}} effect and for the new fields to be hedged or fenced and new thoroughfares laid out. This meant, over <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> three years, organising the collection of stone for the making of roads; purchasing thousands of quickset (or whitethorn) plants, having them planted as hedges, and also arranging for ditches to be dug, fence posts put in, saplings bought for plantations, and all the other tasks that were specified in the Award. George also finished the building of the Hall, and in time established the family amongst the local gentry. Upon his death in 1850 the estate passed to his only son, George (1809–1856), who enjoyed only a short tenure before being succeeded by his son George Henry Fillingham (1841–95) in 1856.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the first}} {{settlement}} by the British in 1625, through history {{the economy of}} Barbados was primarily dependent on agriculture. It had been recorded that minus the marshes and gully regions, during the 1630s much of the desirable land had been deforested across the entire island. Quickly Barbados was then divided into large estate-plantations and using indentured labour mainly from the British Isles for the cultivation of tobacco and cotton crops were first introduced. The island, facing {{a large amount of}} competition from the North American colonies and the neighbouring West Indian islands, switched to the crop of sugar cane. Cultivation of sugar cane was quickly introduced by the exiled Jewish community which immigrated into Barbados from Dutch Brazil during the mid-17th century. The introduction of sugar cane became the single best move for the Barbados economy at the time, the economy boomed and Barbados had become populated with so many windmills that the island had the second highest density of windmills per square mile in the world, second only to the Netherlands. For <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 100 years Barbados remained the richest of all the European colonies in the Caribbean region due to sugar. The prosperity in the colony of Barbados remained regionally unmatched until sugar cane production caught up in geographically larger countries such as Jamaica and elsewhere. Despite being eclipsed by larger makers of sugar, Barbados continued to produce the crop well into the 20th century and to this day.|$|E
