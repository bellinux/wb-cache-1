60|$|Thus, {{though every}} stage of the labour [186] {{bestowed}} on raw material, {{for the purpose of}} giving rise to a certain product, confers some additional value on that material in the estimation of those who are engaged in manufacturing that product, the ratio of that <b>accumulated</b> <b>value,</b> at any stage of the process, to the value of the finished product is extremely inconstant, and often small; while, to other persons, the value of the unfinished product may be nothing, or even a minus quantity. A house-timber merchant, for example, might consider that wood which had been worked into the ribs of a ship was spoiled--that is, had less value than it had as a log.|$|E

50|$|Net {{level premium}} reserves, also called benefit reserves, only involve two cash flows {{and are used}} for some US GAAP {{reporting}} purposes. The valuation premium in an NLP reserve is a premium such {{that the value of}} the reserve at time zero is equal to zero. The net level premium reserve is found by taking the expected value of the loss random variable defined above. They can be formulated prospectively or retrospectively. The amount of prospective reserves at a point in time is derived by subtracting the actuarial present value of future valuation premiums from the actuarial present value of the future insurance benefits. Retrospective reserving subtracts <b>accumulated</b> <b>value</b> of benefits from <b>accumulated</b> <b>value</b> of valuation premiums as of a point in time. The two methods yield identical results (assuming bases are the same for both prospective and retrospective calculations).|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately the modular {{multiplication}} method {{outlined above}} {{needs to know}} {{the magnitude of the}} <b>accumulated</b> <b>value</b> at every step, in order to decide whether to subtract r: for example, if it needs to know whether the value in the accumulator is greater than 1000000000000, the carry-save representation 111111111121 is useless and needs to be converted to its true binary value for the comparison to be made.|$|E

We focus on annuities with payments varying in arithmetic and geometric progression which are important basic varying annuities (see Kellison, 1991). They {{appear to be}} a generalization of the types studied recently by Zaks (2001). We derive, via recursive relationships, mean and variance formulae of the final values of the annuities. As a consequence, we obtain moments related to the already discussed cases, which leads to a correction of main results from Zaks (2001). Comment: 14 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} a dynamic accumulator which is a cryptographic accumulator that allows to dynamically add and delete a value, such that the cost of an add or delete is independent of the number of <b>accumulated</b> <b>values.</b> We show that dynamic accumulators enable efficient revocation of anonymous credentials. We provide a construction of a dynamic accumulator and an efficient zero-knowledge proof of member knowledge and prove their security under the strong RSA assumption. We finally apply our construction to achieve membership revocation for recent group signature and identity escrow schemes and anonymous credential systems...|$|R

In this paper the correlation between <b>accumulated</b> <b>values</b> of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and carbon monoxide (CO) with insulation resistance in oil-filled power transformers is studied using FL.

50|$|One {{important}} area of capital flows is direct investment—outright ownership or control (as opposed to portfolio investment).
