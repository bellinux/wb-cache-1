The first episode reveals that he vanished at sea six months previously and that everybody who knew him (including Peter) assumed that he committed suicide. Each week there are further indications {{that he did not}} die, culminating in episode six when it is revealed that he had a relationship with a woman, and that she had become pregnant with his child after he had supposedly died.

Fortunately, she has wee Virginia Weidler on her side, as well as right, and the murder outs conveniently. <b>As</b> <b>small-town</b> profiles go, this is as definitive as the next, with penetrating sidelights on the weekly bridge nights, the children's dancing school, amours and civic pride." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{early to}} mid fifties saw Thompson {{reaching}} his stride as a mature writer. In 1952, The Killer Inside Me was published. It is perhaps Thompson's finest and best-known novel.
