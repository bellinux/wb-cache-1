5|$|I hemmed and hawed {{about it}} for a while because just for that reason though. Everybody wants to do the theme song of a James Bond movie, and I never liked to do what {{everybody}} else likes to do. It's just some perverse thing in me, right? So, but then I thought about it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> you know what? James Bond needs to get – needs to get techno so...|$|E
5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I {{found it hard to}} make anything of that. In the end I felt the only thing I could do was to make it as hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E
25|$|I'm sick of Wilson... He {{hailed the}} Russian Revolution {{six months ago}} as the new Golden Age, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to Page, 'What does he know of Russia?' to which Page replied, 'Nothing'. As for his talk about a union of hearts after the war, {{the world is not}} made like that.|$|E
60|$|I was gratified {{to be able}} {{to answer}} promptly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> did. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> didn't know.|$|R
60|$|He looked care-worn <b>and</b> grieved. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> {{was afraid}} he had brought bad news with him.|$|R
60|$|I believe <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> all <b>I</b> can, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> it {{with the}} deepest {{interest}} for your welfare.|$|R
25|$|The judge {{hearing the}} case even asked me whether I {{could make the}} film indoors and thus {{accommodate}} Madhubala, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I could not. You will not believe this, but the day the film was released, I saw the same judge coming towards me and saying that I was right, the film {{could only have been}} made outdoors. That's how I won the case. Madhubala did come to my house to apologise and say she was really helpless, but that's okay. I have no complaints.|$|E
25|$|The villa {{was sold}} in 1960 to the Vuilleumier family, who used it first as a private family home, {{and for the past}} few years as a hotel. In 1976 the American writer Gore Vidal (who lived in La Rondinaia, a nearby house built by Lucy Beckett, from 1972 to 2004) wrote of Villa Cimbrone: Twenty five years ago I was asked by an American {{magazine}} what was the most beautiful place that I had ever seen in all my travels <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> the view from the belvedere of the Villa Cimbrone on a bright winter's day when the sky and the sea were each so vividly blue that it was not possible to tell one from the other.|$|E
25|$|So I {{wrote this}} song that I loved and I {{sent it to}} them and he and Joel, I remember, left me a great message saying, I hate you, you bastard, I love this song. We're gonna have to do it. We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cruel, cruel {{the words}} <b>I</b> <b>said!</b> [...] Cruelly came they back to-day: [...] 'You're too slight <b>and</b> fickle,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> [...] 'To trouble {{the heart of}} Edward Gray'.|$|R
60|$|Lov. Look you, Frances, I {{am a man}} of honour, <b>and,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it, I'll {{not break}} my word with you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be alarmed; {{it was my}} duty. I can say no {{more about}} it now, but when it is over I will {{tell you exactly what}} <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> why <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it." ...|$|R
500|$|In a {{roundtable}} {{interview with}} multiple news outlets, Vaughn {{responded to a}} question about choosing [...] "Love Love" [...] by the British band Take That for the end-credits theme, explaining, [...] "I bumped into [...] Gary [...] in , and we were just talking, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Do you want to come and see a rough cut of it?’ And they came, and they wrote the song, and I listened to it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> ‘I think it’ll be a hit’, and if we can do a video which gets girls more interested ... we might get them to come and watch it. So it’s pure commerce, to be blunt, and I want women to see this film." [...] An instrumental of the song [...] "Run (I'm a Natural Disaster)" [...] by Gnarls Barkley is used in the 'mutant recruitment' scene.|$|E
500|$|I saw the Statue of Liberty. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to myself, [...] "Lady, you're such a beautiful! You opened {{your arms}} and {{you get all the}} foreigners here. Give me a chance to prove that I am worth it, to do something, to be someone in America." [...] And always that statue was on my mind.|$|E
500|$|In {{discussion}} of T.I.'s {{participation in the}} track, Timberlake said: [...] "The second hook finished <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Oh, a rapper would sound good on this'." [...] Timbaland, who co-wrote and produced the song, agreed to the idea and suggested T.I. Timberlake agreed to the idea, although he doubted that T.I. would say yes, {{and said that he}} was thankful that T.I. agreed to take part.|$|E
50|$|Constan {{has made}} {{television}} appearances in costume, including Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Unscrewed with Martin Sargent, <b>and</b> Because <b>I</b> <b>Said</b> So.|$|R
6000|$|Undoubtedly {{he meant}} invasion, sir, [...] Had fortune favoured. He may try it yet. [...] <b>And,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> could we but close with Fox--- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>I</b> {{might come}} <b>and</b> look,' <b>I</b> <b>said</b> in German; then, feeling very uncomfortable, in Italian: 'You {{are doing a}} drama, the landlady told me.' ...|$|R
500|$|Richard B. Freeman, {{writing in}} 2011 about the {{contemporaneous}} economic {{situation in the}} United States, called Horton Hatches the Egg a tale of investment. Freeman argued that [...] "economic growth requires long-term investments", as embodied by Horton's sitting on the egg, and that [...] "trust is important in a well-functioning economy", as embodied by Horton's repeated maxim, [...] "I meant what I said,/ <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> what I meant." ...|$|E
500|$|At age 10, Ryder and {{her family}} moved on again, this time to Petaluma, California. During her first week at Kenilworth Junior High, she was bullied {{by a group of}} her peers who mistook her for an effeminate, scrawny boy. [...] "I was wearing an old Salvation Army shop boy’s suit. As I went to the {{bathroom}} I heard people saying, ‘Hey, faggot’. They slammed my head into a locker. I fell to the ground and they started to kick the shit out of me. I had to have stitches. The school kicked me out, not the bullies... Years later, I went to a coffee shop and I ran into one of the girls who’d kicked me, and she said, ‘Winona, Winona, can I have your autograph?’ <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> ‘Do you remember me? Remember in seventh grade you beat up that kid?’ And she said, ‘Kind of’. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> ‘That was me. Go fuck yourself.’" [...] As a result, Ryder ended up being home-schooled that year.|$|E
500|$|I saw a {{video on}} YouTube. [...] had a plain {{background}} {{and it was}} shot on the crane; it was 360 degrees, they could move around. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'This is genius.' We kept {{a lot of the}} Fosse choreography and added the down-south thing—it's called J-Setting, where one person does something and the next person follows. So it was a strange mixture...It's like the most urban choreography, mixed with Fosse—very modern and very vintage.|$|E
60|$|TIM. Oh murdher! An I'll have to sind five timme poor oul {{mother in}} Ireland. But no matther: <b>I</b> <b>said</b> a hundherd; <b>and</b> what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I'll stick to, if I have to starve for it.|$|R
6000|$|... "On Saturday he came again. Your {{father was}} gone, your uncle at home, <b>and,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, {{they had a}} great deal of talk together.|$|R
60|$|Those words formed {{part of the}} {{original}} introduction to this novel. I wrote them nearly ten years since; <b>and</b> what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> then, <b>I</b> say now.|$|R
500|$|According to author Bruce Spizer, the line-up for {{the basic}} track, before overdubs, was Lennon (vocals, {{acoustic}} guitar), Harrison (electric guitar), Preston (organ), Voormann (bass) and White (drums). Lennon later recalled of the recording: [...] "Phil (Spector) came in and said, 'How do you want it?' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> '1950s' and he said 'Right' and BOOM! ... he played it back and there it was." [...] The song uses a similar amount of echo to 1950s Sun Records recordings.|$|E
500|$|And so {{the issue}} was brought up at the {{acceptance}} of the spacecraft, a long drawn-out discussion. [...] I got a little annoyed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Look, there's no way there's going to be a fire in that spacecraft unless there's a spark or the astronauts bring cigarettes aboard. [...] We're not going to let them smoke." [...] Well, I then issued orders at that meeting, [...] "Go clean up the spacecraft. [...] Be sure that all the fire rules are obeyed." ...|$|E
500|$|.....I {{thought about}} what I had been offered <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to myself, [...] "What am I being so damn grand about? I have two {{children}} to support, the part {{they want me to}} play has a lot of dignity, the show is already on the air, I wouldn't have to film a pilot, and they have a sponsor. This is really a great gift that has been offered me. I'd be stupid not to at least look into it." ...|$|E
60|$|FERROVIUS (gripping {{the sword}} <b>and</b> looking dangerous) <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> No armor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Blessed Jesus be thanked," [...] {{said the}} giant, [...] "for I have always heard you called a perfect knight; <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> will follow you {{all my life}} long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then disbelieve it. I {{was with}} him yesterday, and I'll tell you who was there before me;--only don't you go to Robinson <b>and</b> say <b>I</b> <b>said</b> so." ...|$|R
500|$|The movie's strange title {{originated}} from something said by Ringo Starr, who described {{it this way}} {{in an interview with}} disc jockey Dave Hull in 1964: [...] "We went to do a job, and we'd worked all day and we happened to work all night. I came up still thinking it was day I suppose, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'It's been a hard day ...' and I looked around and saw it was dark so I said, '... night!' So we came to A Hard Day's Night." ...|$|E
500|$|Jon Anderson has {{recalled}} how the 1981 album The Friends of Mr Cairo, which he produced with composer Vangelis inspired Thriller, and specifically [...] "Billie Jean". [...] "They took the riff {{and made it}} funky for Billie Jean. Quincy said he'd been recording our song [...] "State of Independence" [...] with Donna Summer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> he had an incredible guy singing backing vocals. He said, 'That guy was Michael – we were both digging your album.' So that's kinda cool, that cross-pollination in music." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{characters}} include Kirstie Alley as Saavik, Spock's protégée and a Starfleet commander-in-training {{aboard the}} Enterprise. The movie was Alley's first feature film role. Saavik cries during Spock's funeral. Meyer said that during filming someone asked him, [...] "'Are {{you going to}} let her do that?' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Yeah,' and they said, 'But Vulcans don't cry,' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Well, that's what makes this such an interesting Vulcan.'" [...] The character's emotional outbursts can be partly {{explained by the fact that}} Saavik was described as of mixed Vulcan-Romulan heritage in the script, though no indication is given on film. Alley was so fond of her Vulcan ears that she would take them home with her at the end of each day. Bibi Besch plays Carol Marcus, the lead scientist working on Project Genesis, and the mother of Kirk's son, David (played by Merritt Butrick). Meyer was looking for an actress who looked beautiful enough that it was plausible a womanizer such as Kirk would fall for her, yet who could also project a sense of intelligence. Meyer liked that Butrick's hair was blond like Besch's and curly like Shatner's, making him a plausible son of the two. John Winston reprises his series role as Kyle, the Enterprise transporter chief now Commander Kyle aboard Reliant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only when I {{told him}} that he had better go to you. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>said</b> {{afterward}} <b>I</b> was afraid you were very ill. We were in the confusion of arriving at Folkestone--and, even if I had thought it right to say more, there was no opportunity." ...|$|R
6000|$|Thus {{still she}} vouched, <b>and</b> still <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "O sprite, that cannot be!" [...] . It {{was as if}} my bosom bled, [...] So much she troubled me.|$|R
60|$|Next {{he asked}} our names, {{and from what}} land we hailed. He seemed quite {{familiar}} with the geography of the outerworld, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was from Helium he raised his brows.|$|R
