5|$|Bart {{talks to}} Edna after class {{and starts to}} feel worse <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did when {{he is unable to}} console her. He tells the family what he had done, and the Simpsons then write a romantically poetic and {{diplomatic}} letter to tell her how Woodrow must leave, which makes Edna feel better.|$|E
5|$|Peter, Joe and Quagmire drag Cleveland {{to a bar}} {{to get him to}} {{meet some}} women, as he's still reeling from him and Loretta getting a divorce. It doesn’t work so well, so when The Bachelorette comes to Quahog, Peter takes Cleveland to {{audition}} for the show. Cleveland gets nervous at the audition and in an effort to calm him, Peter removes Cleveland’s clothes and then his own. The producers see this and Brian apologizes for what happened with Peter and Cleveland--Brian begins to explain how Cleveland and his wife recently divorced and how Cleveland's confused <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> really wants in a relationship.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{concepts}} had become U.S. policy, Kennan began {{to criticize the}} foreign policies that he had seemingly helped begin. Subsequently, prior {{to the end of}} 1948, Kennan became confident that positive dialogue could commence with the Soviet government. His proposals were discounted by the Truman administration and Kennan's influence was marginalized, particularly after Dean Acheson was appointed Secretary of State in 1949. Soon thereafter, U.S. Cold War strategy assumed a more assertive and militaristic quality, causing Kennan to lament <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> believed was an abrogation of his previous assessments.|$|E

5|$|The {{script was}} sent to Prince who agreed to voice the {{character}} and sent back a page of notes <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would be wearing in various scenes. The writers were confused when the notes did not correspond to the script and they discovered that Prince was referring to a script that had been written by someone else. Prince disliked the Simpsons writers' script and demanded the other one be made into an episode, but the writers refused. The episode eventually fell through and never made it past written form. It {{became one of the}} few completed scripts never to be produced.|$|E
5|$|When the live-action of the manga was made, Watsuki {{had several}} ideas about Kenshin's mind about his early {{appearances}} in the series. This resulted in the manga reboot Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration where Kenshin's characterization was expanded by the author who thought in retrospective <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could add to him. Although there were some changes to the cast, Watsuki {{wanted them to be}} subtle such as Kenshin wearing a scarf. He also wrote a prequel chapter to the original series which helped the readers to understand why Kenshin would stay in Kaoru's dojo.|$|E
5|$|After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology {{mounted a}} public {{relations}} campaign to address issues in the piece. It took out advertisements in USA Today for twelve weeks, and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by Ted Koppel on Nightline <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{considered to be an}} objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The Church of Scientology brought a libel suit against Time Warner and Behar, and sued Reader's Digest in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001.|$|E

5|$|At the mall, Michael {{opens to}} the women about his {{discomfort}} with Jan. Among other things, he tells them Jan has been videotaping them having sex and watching it with him afterwards. All the women assure Michael that Jan's behavior is not normal and urge {{him to get out}} of the relationship. He remains conflicted <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> should do about Jan, but at Phyllis's prompting he finally admits to himself that he wants to break up with her. Michael thanks them for their help by treating them to one item each at Victoria's Secret. On the drive back, Pam takes a step toward asserting herself by changing a flat tire on Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) car. At the office, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) sneaks in{{to the women}}'s bathroom and discovers a plush waiting room. The other men soon join him.|$|E
5|$|In 1092 {{and again}} in 1093 the dispute with Canterbury resurfaced, when Thomas complained <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> felt were {{infringements}} of York's rights. The first of these occasions was over the dedication of Remigius de Fécamp's new cathedral at Lincoln and the second concerned the consecration of Anselm as Archbishop of Canterbury. Thomas refused to consecrate Anselm if the latter {{was referred to as}} Primate of England. The impasse was finally resolved by naming Anselm the Metropolitan of Canterbury. The medieval chronicler Eadmer, Anselm's biographer and a Canterbury partisan, says that Anselm was consecrated as the primate. Hugh the Chanter, {{who was a member of}} the York community, stated that the metropolitan title was used. Modern historical opinion is divided, with Frank Barlow, author of The English Church 1066–1154 inclined towards the primatial title, but with Richard Southern, in his biography of Anselm, leaning towards the metropolitan title. The whole affair is probably subject to much duplicity and dishonesty, with both sides presenting biased accounts.|$|E
5|$|John was incensed <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{perceived}} as an abrogation of his customary right as monarch to influence the election. He complained both about the choice of Langton as an individual, as John felt he was overly influenced by the Capetian court in Paris, and about the process as a whole. He barred Langton from entering England and seized the lands of the archbishopric and other papal possessions. Innocent set a commission in place {{to try to convince}} John to change his mind, but to no avail. Innocent then placed an interdict on England in March 1208, prohibiting clergy from conducting religious services, with the exception of baptisms for the young, and confessions and absolutions for the dying.|$|E

40|$|It’s often said, {{and with}} good reason, {{that we are not}} told by the way things are how they ought to be; there’s no {{deriving}} an “ought” from an “is. ” However, it is just as often said, and with just as good, or better, reason, that sometimes the way things ought to be does indeed tell us how they are; “ought” implies “can. ” That a person ought to do something, that the world ought to include his doing of it, tells us something <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he’s</b> like; it tells us <b>what</b> <b>he</b> can do, namely, the thing he ought. For simplicity, call this “the Maxim”: A person ought to perform a certain action only if he can do so. Appealing to the Maxim {{is not the only way}} some feel we can learn about how the world is from examination of how it ought to be. Many think, also, that from examination of what a person ought to do we learn something else <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he’s</b> capable of doing; we learn, on this view, that he can do something other than <b>what</b> <b>he</b> ought. Those who accept this view accept the “Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP) ”: A person is morally responsible for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did only if he could have done otherwise...|$|R

A Mech kills everyone, except for Tom, presumably to tell others <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> witnessed. He begins a pilgrimage back to Boston. On his way, he finds a girl, Teresa (Laine MacNeil) being mugged. Tom helps her. Teresa’s mother was murdered and Tom and Teresa bury her. They leave together on Teresa’s motorcycle.

While attempting to kill it, Tom is shot by his son, Ben.|$|E
5|$|Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch, a {{linguist}} and cartographer at the Smithsonian who {{was recruited}} to decipher The Shepherd's Journal while directing {{an expedition to}} Atlantis. Kirk Wise, one of the directors, said that they chose Fox for the role because they felt he gave his character his own personality and made them more believable on screen. Fox said that voice acting was much easier than his past experience with live action {{because he did not}} have to worry <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> looked like in front of a camera while delivering his lines. The directors mentioned that Fox was also offered a role for Titan A.E.; he allowed his son to choose which film he would work on, and he chose Atlantis. Viewers have noted similarities between Milo and the film's language consultant, Marc Okrand, who developed the Atlantean language used in the film. Okrand stated that Milo's supervising animator, John Pomeroy, sketched him, claiming not to know how a linguist looked or acted.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the night}} to the morning of September 22, Eisenhower and Nixon aides {{arranged}} the speech. The RNC worked to raise the $75,000 needed to buy the half hour of television time, while the Eisenhower staff secured sixty NBC stations to telecast the speech, with radio coverage from CBS and Mutual. The Nixon staff initially advocated a half hour that evening, Monday, September 22, to follow the immensely popular I Love Lucy show, but when the candidate indicated {{he could not be}} ready that soon, settled for 6:30pm Tuesday night, 9:30pm in the East, following the almost equally popular Texaco Star Theater, starring Milton Berle. The campaign arranged to use the El Capitan Theatre, in Hollywood, where several NBC variety shows were then broadcast, since its lighting was superior to that of NBC Studios. Nixon told the press that he would be addressing the nation on television, but refused to take any questions <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> might say.|$|E

5|$|Although MalcolmX {{retained}} {{final approval}} of their hybrid text, {{he was not}} privy to the actual editorial processes superimposed from Haley's side. The Library of Congress held the answers. This collection includes the papers of Doubleday's then-executive editor, Kenneth McCormick, who had worked closely with Haley for several years as the Autobiography had been constructed. As in the Romaine papers, I found more evidence of Haley's sometimes-weekly private commentary with McCormick about the laborious process of composing the book. They also revealed how several attorneys retained by Doubleday closely monitored and vetted entire sections of the controversial text in 1964, demanding numerous name changes, the reworking and deletion of blocks of paragraphs, and so forth. In late 1963, Haley was particularly worried <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> viewed as MalcolmX's anti-Semitism. He therefore rewrote material to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the book manuscript, with the explicit covert goal of 'getting them past MalcolmX,' without his coauthor's knowledge or consent. Thus, the censorship of MalcolmX had begun well prior to his assassination.|$|E
5|$|In his absence, {{the issue}} of female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) had become a topic of strong debate in Kikuyu society. The Protestant churches, backed by European medics and the colonial authorities, supported the abolition of this traditional practice, but the KCA rallied to its defence, claiming that its abolition would {{be a threat to}} the structure and customs of Kikuyu society. Anger between the two sides had heightened, with several churches expelling KCA members from their congregations, and it was widely believed that the January 1930 killing of the American nun, Hulda Stumpf, had been due to the issue. As Secretary of the KCA, Kenyatta soon attended a meeting with church representatives. There, he expressed the view that although he personally opposed FGM, he regarded its legal abolition as counter-productive, and that the churches should focus on eradicating the practice through education of its harmful effects on women's health. The meeting ended without compromise, and John Arthur—the head of the Church of Scotland in Kenya—later complained <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> described as Kenyatta's dishonesty during the debate, expelling him from the church. In 1931, Kenyatta took his son out of the church school at Thogota and enrolled him in a KCA-approved, independent school.|$|E
5|$|Rhys treats Susan {{when she}} has an MS relapse and he tries {{to make sure she}} is {{prepared}} in case her condition becomes worse. He later looks after Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) when she is brought in with severe morning sickness. Vanessa learns Rhys has been talking about her with his friends and she tells him to stay out of her business. Rhys later helps Vanessa carry some boxes and he spends the day baking a cake with her. He buys her a new mixer and Vanessa invites him to dinner. Rhys gives the cake to Elaine and when he tells her about Vanessa, she warns him to think <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is doing before letting it go any further. Rhys thinks about cancelling on Vanessa, but he later arrives with dessert. Rhys asks Vanessa to bid on him at a charity bachelor auction, so he can raise more money than Karl. Vanessa wins and she chooses a couples massage for them to enjoy together. Rhys learns Susan has befriended Elaine and he angrily tells her to stay away from his mother. Vanessa witnesses the scene and becomes cold towards him. Rhys apologises to Susan and opens up to Vanessa about why he did it.|$|E

5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E
