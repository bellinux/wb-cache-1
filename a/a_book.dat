5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Book</b> of the Dead papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes.

5|$|David told Scott-James {{that she}} planned to publish the {{articles}} as <b>a</b> <b>book,</b> and was allowed to retain the copyright by the magazine. Even before all the articles had been published, she had assembled them into a typescript volume called <b>A</b> <b>Book</b> of Mediterranean Food; many of the recipes ignored the restrictions of rationing in favour of authenticity, and several cases the ingredients were not available in British shops. David submitted her manuscript {{to a series of}} publishers, all of whom turned it down. One of them explained that a collection of unconnected recipes needed linking text. David took this advice, but conscious of her inexperience as a writer she kept her own prose short and quoted extensively from established authors whose views on the Mediterranean might carry more weight. She submitted the revised typescript to John Lehmann, a publisher more associated with poetry than cookery; he accepted it and agreed to an advance payment of £100. <b>A</b> <b>Book</b> of Mediterranean Food was published in June 1950.|$|E
