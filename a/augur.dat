One of the Twelve Olympians, Apollo was cast down from Olympus {{and turned into a}} human named Lester by Zeus after the war against Gaea in The Blood of Olympus. Zeus blames him for {{encouraging}} his descendant, the <b>augur</b> Octavian, to follow his dangerous path and for prematurely revealing the Prophecy of Seven. Lester is a narcissistic, 16-year-old, out-of-shape teenager with curly brown hair, blue eyes, and acne.|$|E
5|$|The historians Tacitus and Suetonius {{record the}} funeral and posthumous honors of Germanicus. His name was placed into the Carmen Saliare, {{and onto the}} Curule chairs that were placed with oaken garlands over them as honorary seats for the Augustan priesthood. His ivory statue was {{at the head of}} the {{procession}} during the Circus Games; his posts as priest of Augustus and <b>Augur</b> were to be filled by members of the imperial family; knights of Rome gave his name to a block of seats at a theatre in Rome, and rode behind his effigy on 15 July AD 20.|$|E
5|$|To fix the {{problems}} at Fort Jackson, Alexander recommended the addition of an artillery section, a second company of infantry, and various improvements to the fort itself. Spurred {{in part by the}} Confederate attack on Fort Stevens north of Washington, several improvements were made, including the restoration of gates that had been removed when the railroad line was constructed. Gen. Christopher Columbus <b>Augur,</b> commander of the Department of Washington, recommended that Fort Jackson be assigned two light guns as armament during the reconstruction.|$|E

5|$|Yet {{the return}} of Titus further {{highlighted}} the comparative insignificance of Domitian, both militarily and politically. As the eldest and most experienced of Vespasian's sons, Titus shared tribunician power with his father, received seven consulships, the censorship, and was given command of the Praetorian Guard; powers that left no doubt he was the designated heir to the Empire. As a second son, Domitian held honorary titles, such as Caesar or Princeps Iuventutis, and several priesthoods, including those of <b>augur,</b> pontifex, frater arvalis, magister frater arvalium, and sacerdos collegiorum omnium, but no office with imperium.|$|E
5|$|After the boys' {{father died}} {{while they were}} young, {{responsibility}} for their education fell to their mother. Cornelia ensured the brothers had the best available Greek tutors, teaching them oratory and political science. The brothers were also well trained in martial pursuits; in horsemanship and combat they outshone all their peers. The older brother Tiberius was elected an <b>augur</b> at only 16 – according to the historian J.C. Stobart, had he taken the easy path rather than the cause of radical reform, {{he would have been}} clearly destined for consulship. Tiberius was the most distinguished young officer in the Third Punic War, Rome's last campaign against Carthage. He was the first to scale Carthage's walls; before that he saved an army of 20,000 men by skilled diplomacy. As the boys grew up, they developed strong connections with the ruling elite.|$|E
5|$|Following the Confederate raid on Washington that {{resulted}} in the Battle of Fort Stevens, new assessments were made of weak spots in Washington's defenses. In the three years between the construction of Fort Stanton and the attack on Fort Stevens, Fort Stanton's perimeter had been greatly increased with the addition of two subsidiary forts and additional rifle pits and trenches, as well as the completion of the military ring road. A report by Maj. Gen. Christopher C. <b>Augur</b> of the U.S. Volunteers recommended Fort Stanton receive one 32-pounder howitzer, two 4½-inch rifled guns, four 12-pounder howitzers, and two 12-pounder Napoleons to bolster its defenses and control its position {{at the center of the}} Eastern Branch defenses.|$|E

After {{she and the}} <b>augur</b> Octavian meet Rachel and Grover Underwood in New York City, Rachel gives her a message from Annabeth stating that Reyna {{was the only person}} able to take Athena Parthenos back to Camp Half-Blood and prevent the war between the Greeks and Romans. She agrees and goes to Greece on her pegasus, Scipio, in search of the other demigods, leaving Octavian in power.

5|$|At the house, the Doctor is {{surprised}} by Caecilius's daughter Evelina, {{who seems to}} have extrasensory perception (ESP) and knows personal details about the Doctor and Donna. They are interrupted by the local <b>augur,</b> Lucius Petrus Dextrus, who has arrived to collect a sculpture he commissioned. The Doctor is intrigued by the sculpture, which resembles a segment of an oversized circuit board. Lucius Petrus reveals that he also has powerful ESP and calls out the name of the Doctor's home planet, Gallifrey. The Doctor wishes {{to learn more about the}} sculptures and enlists Caecilius's son Quintus to help him break into Lucius Petrus' house. Inside, the Doctor deduces that the circuits will make an energy converter, but he is caught by Lucius Petrus. The two escape, but Lucius Petrus beckons a large stone creature to attack and kill them. The stone creature appears in Caecilius's house and attacks them, but Quintus saves them by dousing the creature in water and killing it. In the confusion, the Sisterhood kidnap Donna, and the Doctor sets off to rescue her. He meets the high priestess of the Sisterhood, who is revealed to be transforming into a stone creature. The Doctor discovers that they are being controlled by the Pyroviles, volcanic creatures whose home planet of Pyrovilia was lost. The Doctor is attacked by the Sisterhood, but he escapes with Donna into an underground tunnel that leads into the heart of Mount Vesuvius.|$|E
5|$|In 1341, the once-mighty Byzantine Empire {{was in a}} {{state of}} turmoil. Despite the {{restoration}} of the Empire's capital to Constantinople and the recovery of a measure of its former power by Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282), the policies implemented during his reign had exhausted the state's resources, and the Empire's strength waned under his successor, Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328). During Andronikos II's long reign, the remaining Byzantine possessions in Asia Minor slowly fell to the advancing Turks, most notably the newly established Ottoman emirate. This caused a flood of refugees into Byzantium's European provinces, while at the same time the Catalan Company wrought havoc in the imperial domains. Taxes also rose dramatically to finance tributes to the Empire's enemies. A combination of these failures and personal ambition moved the Emperor's grandson and heir, the young Andronikos III Palaiologos, to revolt. Supported by a group of young aristocrats led by John Kantakouzenos and Syrgiannes Palaiologos, Andronikos III deposed his grandfather after a series of conflicts during the 1320s. Although successful in removing the old Emperor from power, the war did not <b>augur</b> well for the future, as the Empire's neighbours—the Serbs, Bulgarians, Turks, Genoese and Venetians—took advantage of Byzantine infighting to gain territory or expand their influence within the Empire.|$|E

25|$|By ancient tradition, {{presiding}} magistrates sought divine {{opinion of}} proposed actions through an <b>augur,</b> {{who read the}} divine will through the observation of natural signs in the sacred space (templum) of sacrifice. Magistrates could use their right of augury (ius augurum) to adjourn and overturn the process of law, but were obliged to base their decision on the augur's observations and advice. For Cicero, this made the <b>augur</b> the most powerful authority in the Late Republic.|$|E

Major Generals Quincy Gillmore and Alexander McCook commanded the Northeast sector and the reserve post at Blagden farm, respectively. <b>Augur</b> commanded an impressive thirty one thousand troops and a thousand cannon in one hundred sixty fortifications, batteries, and trenches. Eighty-seven fortifications were located north of the Potomac (facing Early's approach) with 484 heavy guns and 13,986 men. Land was cleared surrounding the city to create battlegrounds and open areas for fire. Six companies of the 8th Illinois Cavalry were stationed {{in front of the}} Northern defenses.|$|E

25|$|Divine disapproval could arise through unfit sacrifice, errant rites (vitium) or an {{unacceptable}} plan of action. If an unfavourable sign was given, the magistrate could repeat the sacrifice until favourable signs were seen, consult with his augural colleagues, or abandon the project. Magistrates could use their right of augury (ius augurum) to adjourn and overturn {{the process of}} law, but were obliged to base their decision on the augur's observations and advice. For Cicero, himself an <b>augur,</b> this made the <b>augur</b> the most powerful authority in the Late Republic. By his time (mid 1st century BC) augury was supervised by the college of pontifices, whose powers were increasingly woven into the magistracies of the cursus honorum.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 90s, young Marcus {{and his brother}} Lucius unsuccessfully prosecuted Servilius the <b>Augur.</b> This man had earlier functioned as the {{prosecutor}} in the trial for embezzlement (de repetundis) that sent their father, Lucius Licinius Lucullus into exile to Lucania.|$|E
25|$|A {{captured}} comanchero, Edwardo Ortiz, {{had told}} the army that the Comanches were on their winter hunting grounds along the Red River on the Staked Plains. Gen. Christopher C. <b>Augur,</b> commander of the Department of Texas sent a detachment from Fort Concho, Texas, under Capt. Napoleon Bonaparte McLaughlin on a two-month reconnaissance patrol {{in the spring of}} 1872. He returned to the fort, confirming that the main force of the Comanches were in camps on the Staked Plains. Ortiz further claimed that army columns could successfully maneuver in that country. General <b>Augur</b> then summoned Colonel Ranald Mackenzie to San Antonio where they held a strategy meeting. Out of this meeting, the army developed a campaign against the Comanche in their strongholds in the Staked Plains.|$|E

50|$|Livy also {{records that}} before the temple's {{construction}} shrines to other gods occupied the site. When the <b>augurs</b> carried out the rites seeking permission to remove them, only Terminus and Juventas were believed to have refused. Their shrines were therefore incorporated into the new structure. Because he was the god of boundaries, Terminus's refusal to be moved was interpreted as a favorable omen {{for the future of}} the Roman state. A second portent was the appearance of the head of a man to workmen digging the foundations of the temple. This was said by the <b>augurs</b> (including <b>augurs</b> brought especially from Etruria) to mean that Rome was to be the head of a great empire.|$|R
