40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new routing scheme for wireless ad hoc networks that provides fresh routing information along <b>active</b> <b>routes</b> with affordable cost. The proposed routing mechanism, called proactive route maintenance (PRM), {{is used to}} replace the naive route mechanism in existing reactive (ondemand) routing protocols to improve reliability and reduce route discovery cost. The assumption behind PRM is the communication locality, i. e., most data packets are transported along a few <b>active</b> <b>routes.</b> Data packets are forwarded via multiple optimal paths to meet certain QoS requirements, such as fault tolerance and load balance. Routing information is disseminated along <b>active</b> <b>routes</b> and advertised only by active nodes that forward data packets. Alternative paths are dynamically discovered and maintained by active nodes and their 1 -hop neighbors (called passive nodes). The routing overhead in passive nodes is light. PRM maintains reliable end-to-end connections in dynamic networks with low overhead, and has the desirable properties including high delivery ratio, low latency, fair load distribution, self-healing, and self-optimization...|$|R

30|$|One {{approach}} that mitigates the connectivity maintenance limitations of AODV mentioned above is {{the maintenance of}} routes using preemptive mechanisms. Preemptive route recovery comprehends the following two components: link quality monitoring and route recovery [9].

In such cases, the node which detects the performance degradation warns the source of the route (which then can start the discovery of a new route) or starts a local repair process in order to find an alternative route.|$|R

50|$|Pennsylvania Route 266 {{started out}} as a 5 1/2 mile route in Fayette County, running from PA 166 near New Geneva to U.S. 119 in Smithfield. In 1950, the {{original}} PA Route 121 across the Monongahela River in Greene County was decommissioned and the segment from PA 88 in Greensboro to PA 21 in East Waynesburg was renumbered PA 266. As a result, a ferry was provided as a connector for the two designations across the Monongahela between Greensboro and New Geneva.

Six years later, PA 780's second (and currently active) designation was assigned in Westmoreland County.

50|$|In the {{maturation}} stage, the ameloblasts transport substances used in {{the formation}} of enamel. Microscopically, the most notable aspect of this phase is that these cells become striated, or have a ruffled border. These signs demonstrate that the ameloblasts have changed their function from production, as in the secretory stage, to transportation. Proteins used for the mineralization process compose most of the material transported into the matrix, importantly amelogenins, ameloblastins, enamelins, and tuftelins. The Ca2+ mainly comes from the enamel organ, and not the dental papilla, by either passive, extracellular transportation or active, intracellular transportation. The <b>active</b> <b>route</b> is controlled by ameloblasts so the site of mineralization can have a tightly controlled climate, including modulation of proteins that inhibit mineralization (e.g. Serum-derived Albumin) and concentration of ions.|$|E

30|$|The {{aforementioned}} {{problem can}} be significantly mitigated by means of preemptive route maintenance [9]. This technique allows nodes to monitor {{the quality of the}} links that participate in <b>active</b> <b>routes,</b> decide when the quality is no longer acceptable, and, in that case, trigger route recovery immediately, before an actual route break occurs. To the best of our knowledge, state-of-the-art solutions in this area are limited to using link break predictors and anticipating route recovery with the objective of reducing route disconnections due to node mobility [9 â€“ 17]. Nevertheless, as we argue in this paper, a comprehensive solution is required which considers other causes of route performance degradation like interference or congestion.|$|R
