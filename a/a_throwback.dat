5|$|In 2003, the Steelers {{played the}} Philadelphia Eagles in a preseason game {{to commemorate the}} 60th anniversary of the Steagles team, when the two merged {{as a result of}} player {{shortages}} caused by World War II.

Instead, the team had the south end zone painted in plain diagonal white lines, which were common in NFL endzones until the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, DiCaprio {{starred in}} Body of Lies, a spy film {{based on the}} novel of the same name by David Ignatius, set in context of the Middle East and the War on Terror, telling the story of three men battling a {{terrorist}} organization, and each other. Directed by Ridley Scott, DiCaprio dyed his hair brown and wore brown contacts for the role, which he chose to pursue because he considered it <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> to political films of the 1970s such as The Parallax View (1974) and Three Days of the Condor (1975). The film received mixed reviews from critics, and at a budget of US$67.5 million, became a moderate box office success, grossing US$115 million worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Writer and series creator Chris Carter {{decided that}} {{rather than trying to}} present a typical Bigfoot-like creature, he would present the Jersey Devil as a missing link. Carter was {{inspired}} to write the episode by an essay by E. O. Wilson regarding ants and a story he wrote that posed whether mankind was hellbent on its own extinction. The concept of mankind being carnivores and eating its own tail evolved into the idea of using an evolutionary mutation that was <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> to the Neanderthal. A Greg Cannom werewolf outfit from a previous project was used for the costume of the creature.|$|E

5|$|Forgoing the {{downloadable}} content {{model used}} in previous Guitar Hero games, Guitar Hero Live adds songs {{to the game}} via Guitar Hero TV (GHTV), an online game mode offered free of charge in Guitar Hero Live. Instead of playing the immersive first-person view that the main career mode presents, songs on GHTV are played over the music video or footage of the band playing at a concert. Songs on GHTV are normally offered in a curated rotation, similar to a music video channel, allowing the player to drop in and out, but the player can use collected in-game rewards or use microtransactions to play any available song outside of this rotation. FreeStyleGames found that this approach, {{in contrast to the}} traditional downloadable content model, made it easier to secure licensing rights with artists to use their songs, as well as <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> to the heyday of music video channels like MTV.|$|E
5|$|Rommel was {{an ambitious}} {{man who took}} {{advantage}} of his proximity to Hitler and willingly accepted the propaganda campaigns designed for him by Goebbels. He sought {{to level the playing}} field for non-nobles, and also supported militarism and a strong German Empire, while treating people only according to their merits. He did not display hatred to people of noble descent, and in fact was <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> to the medieval knight in his personal traits, appearing well-versed in the ancient customs of chivalry, which helped to attract admiration from the British who saw in him a romantic archetype. Rommel classed himself as a traditionalist regarding military ethics and a modernist regarding warfare techniques. Certain authors remark that he also sought military glory and personal recognition, most of all from Hitler on whom, according to Watson, Rommel projected his idea of the German people's will.|$|E
5|$|Zappas was notably {{inspired}} by Panagiotis Soutsos and resolved to revive this ancient tradition {{through his own}} efforts and resources. In early 1856, he sent a letter through diplomatic channels to King Otto of Greece, offering to fund {{the revival of the}} Olympic Games, and to provide cash prizes to the victors. However, this initiative was not without opposition. There was wide belief among some Greek politicians that athletic games were <b>a</b> <b>throwback</b> to ancient times, unsuited to the modern era. Alexandros Rizos Rangavis, the Greek foreign minister and head of the conservative anti-athletics lobby in Athens, suggested an industrial and agricultural exposition instead of an athletics event. For months there was no official answer from the Greek state. In July 1856, an article in the Greek press by Panagiotis Soutsos made Zappas's proposal widely known to the public and triggered a series of events. King Otto agreed to the organization of athletics competitions at four-year intervals, with Zappa's full sponsorship, to coincide with industrial and agricultural expositions. As a result, Zappas provided the Greek government with the necessary financial resources to establish an Olympic Trust Fund.|$|E
