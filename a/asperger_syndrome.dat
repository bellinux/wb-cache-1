5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of AS {{is complicated by}} the use of several different screening instruments, including the <b>Asperger</b> <b>Syndrome</b> Diagnostic Scale (ASDS), Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), Childhood Autism Spectrum Test (CAST) (previously called the Childhood <b>Asperger</b> <b>Syndrome</b> Test), Gilliam Asperger's disorder scale (GADS), Krug Asperger's Disorder Index (KADI), and the Autism-spectrum quotient (AQ; with versions for children, adolescents and adults).

40|$|This thesis explores {{participatory}} research {{involving the}} author and {{a small group of}} adults with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> as co-researchers. The research was {{based on the assumption that}} people with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> think differently from neuro-typical people (people who do not have <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> or autism). It is not denied that people with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> have difficulties, but the thesis argues that these are caused by living in a world which is dominated by neuro-typical people who do not understand or allow for the differences that people with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> have. The research is based on the assumption that adults with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> are able to be co-researchers and that part of the task of the researcher and the co-researchers was to find a way of working together that was enabling to all involved in the research. The original aim of the research was to ascertain what kind of service provision adults with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> wanted and this formed the research question: ‘What support do adults with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> want?’ The findings of the research challenge traditional notions of support as the emphasis is taken away from support to consider forms of understanding. It has resulted in the proposal of a new way of understanding <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> It proposes models for understanding how people with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> and neuro-typical people relate to each other. These models challenge a currently prevailing deficit-based understanding of <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The author and the co-researchers worked collaboratively to design research tools, collect and analyse data and disseminate findings. The data was collected from other adults with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> who took part in questionnaires and then different adults with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> who took part in a focus group and individual interviews. The work was informed by the literature on spatial understandings of how society is ordered. The thesis uses this spatial understanding as a way of analysing how people with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> are regarded in a society which is dominated by people who are neuro-typical. Insights from a spatial understanding are also used to consider the process of the research, including an application of the social model of disability to participatory research involving adults with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> My original contribution to knowledge is that I have demonstrated that people with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> have the potential to work in group situations on a complex piece of research. I have shown that people with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> are able to make a significant contribution to the understanding of how people with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> and neuro-typical people relate to each other. I have also demonstrated how a non-disabled researcher and co-researchers with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> can work together and devise working methods which are enabling. In the words of the thesis, I have demonstrated how an ‘autistic research space’ can be created. This thesis discusses the role of the neuro-typical researcher in the creation of this research space. The research is regarded as having been co-produced and the meaning of this is explored. The thesis discusses the nature of participatory research using a spatial understanding. Emancipatory research is said to be based on the social model of disability, where non-disabled researchers are not involved. I have shown that participatory research can also be based on the insights from the social model of disability and achieve the outcomes required for emancipatory research. I have proposed a framework for planning and analysing participatory research. Perhaps the most significant contribution to knowledge is the new way of understanding <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> proposed by the research which challenges the more traditionally accepted deficit based model...|$|R

40|$|<b>Asperger's</b> <b>syndrome</b> (an autistic disorder) is {{characterized}} by stereotyped and obsessional behaviours, and pervasive abnormalities in socio-emotional and communicative behaviour. These symptoms lead to social exclusion and a significant healthcare burden; however, their neurobiological basis is poorly understood. There are few studies on brain anatomy of <b>Asperger's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and no focal anatomical abnormality has been reliably reported from brain imaging studies of autism, although there is increasing evidence for differences in limbic circuits. These brain regions are important in sensorimotor gating, and impaired 'gating' may partly explain the failure of people with autistic disorders to inhibit repetitive thoughts and actions. Thus, we compared brain anatomy and sensorimotor gating in healthy people with <b>Asperger's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and controls. We included 21 adults with <b>Asperger's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and 24 controls. All had normal IQ and were aged 18 - 49 years. We studied brain anatomy using quantitative MRI, and sensorimotor gating using prepulse inhibition of startle in a subset of 12 individuals with <b>Asperger's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and 14 controls, We found significant age-related differences in volume of cerebral hemispheres and caudate nuclei (controls, but not people with <b>Asperger's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> had age-related reductions in volume). Also, people with <b>Asperger's</b> <b>syndrome</b> had significantly less grey matter in fronto-striatal and cerebellar regions than controls, and widespread differences in white matter. Moreover, sensorimotor gating was significantly impaired in <b>Asperger's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> People with <b>Asperger's</b> <b>syndrome</b> most likely have generalized alterations in brain development, but this is associated with significant differences from controls in the anatomy and function of specific brain regions implicated in behaviours characterizing the disorder. We hypothesize that <b>Asperger's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is associated with abnormalities in fronto-striatal pathways resulting in defective sensorimotor gating, and consequently characteristic difficulties inhibiting repetitive thoughts, speech and actions. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|Autism {{is caused}} by a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example the vaccine hypotheses, which have been disproven.

Children and adults with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> have an intellectual ability within the normal range but due to their unusual profile of cognitive, social and emotional abilities are vulnerable {{to the development of}} a secondary mood disorder.

This thesis aims to: • Review and investigate current theories concerning visual function in individuals with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> and high functioning autism spectrum disorder and to translate the findings into clinical practice by developing a specific protocol for the eye examination of individuals of this population. • Investigate whether those with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> are more likely to suffer from Meares-Irlen syndrome and/or dyslexia. • Assess the integrity of the M-cell pathway in <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> using perimetric tests available in optometric practice to investigate and also to describe the nature of any defects. • Evaluate eye movement strategies in Asperger’s whilst viewing both text and images. Also to evaluate the most appropriate methodology for investigating eye movements; namely optical digital eye tracking and electrophysiology methodologies. Findings of the investigations include • Eye examinations for individuals with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> should contain the same testing methods as for the general population, with special consideration for clear communication. • There is a depression of M-pathway visual field sensitivity in 57 % (8 / 14) of people with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> supporting previous evidence for an M-cell deficit in some individuals. • There is a raised prevalence of dyslexia in <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> (26 % of a sample of 31) but not necessarily of Meares-Irlen syndrome. • Gaze strategies are abnormal in <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> for both reading and viewing of images.

5|$|As a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder, <b>Asperger</b> <b>syndrome</b> is distinguished by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E

The EEG was recorded during an eyes-closed resting condition from 19 electrode sites, which were clustered into nine regions prior to analysis. One minute of trace was analysed using Fourier transformations to obtain both absolute and relative power estimates in the delta, theta, alpha and beta frequency bands. Wave-shape coherence was calculated for 8 intrahemispheric and 8 interhemispheric electrode pairs. Results The Asperger’s group had a global increase in absolute delta and an anterior increase in relative delta. Both absolute and relative theta were globally increased and relative alpha was globally decreased. Subjects with <b>Asperger’s</b> <b>Syndrome</b> exhibited a broad pattern of reduced hemispheric asymmetry in intrahemispheric coherence.
