40|$|The National Road Transport Commission (NRTC) and Austroads are {{developing}} a Performance Based Standards (PBS) approach to the regulation of heavy vehicles in Australia. There has been general agreement to adopt the performance measure of Gross Mass per vehicle Standard Axle Repetitions (SAR) for PBS vehicles.

40|$|The 2004 {{edition of}} Austroads rigid {{pavement}} design guide {{has been based}} on the work of Packard and Tayabji (1985) which is known as the PCA method. In this method, a number of input parameters are needed to calculate the required concrete base thickness based on the cumulative damage process due to fatigue of concrete and erosion of subbase or subgrade materials. While the PCA method has been known as the most widely used mechanistic design procedure for rigid pavement, it has a number of limitations. This paper reviews the 2004 design guide, introduces a design software specifically developed to study the guide and highlights some important points. In addition, a finite element program EverFE 2. 23 has been used to determine the critical configuration and position of <b>axle</b> <b>groups.</b> Results of the current study show the complex interdependence of the many parameters.

40|$|The Load Equivalency Factor (LEF) and the Truck Factor (TF) {{are defined}} as the {{relative}} damage of an <b>axle</b> <b>group</b> or a truck {{to that of a}} standard axle. In the mechanistic approach, the fatigue damage caused by a given axle configuration is calculated using fatigue equations derived from single haversine or continuous sinusoidal loading pulses.

In addition, the fatigue damage was obtained for different pavement structures using the SAPSI-M computer program and compared with laboratory results.

Results indicate that structural performance of concrete pavements is significantly affected by boundary conditions between concrete slab and base. Corner loading was found to be critical in bonded concrete pavement. Corner loading is also critical when a separation occurs between unbonded concrete slab and base. Furthermore, the benefits offered by unbonded boundary condition cease at a certain differential temperature.

With the help of weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems, the information about date, time, speed, lane of travel, lateral lane position, axle spacing, and wheel load for each vehicle passing a WIM site can be recorded continuously on-site and transferred to a remote computer. This study focused on using the data from two WIM systems installed to support research on pavement performance.

To assist both FHWA and FMCSA in obtaining more information related to this interest, data was collected and analyzed from two separate sources. A large scale nationwide data collection effort was facilitated by the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance as part of a special study on overweight vehicles and an additional, smaller set, of data was collected from the state of Tennessee which included a much more detailed set of data. Over a six-month period, 1, 873 Level I inspections were performed in 18 different states that volunteered {{to be a part of}} this study. Of the 1, 873 inspections, a vehicle out-of-service (OOS) violation was found on 44. 79 % of the vehicles, a rate significantly higher than the national OOS rate of 27. 23 %. The main cause of a vehicle being placed OOS was brake-related defects, with approximately 30 % of all vehicles having an OOS brake violation. Only about 4 % of vehicles had an OOS tire violation, and even fewer had suspension and wheel violations.

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{introduction}} of performance based standards for heavy vehicles, {{the industry is}} developing new generation vehicles incorporating higher tyre pressures, higher axle load limits and new <b>axle</b> <b>group</b> configurations such as quad axle groups. There {{is a need to}} study the impact of these vehicles on pavement performance now rather than waiting 10 - 20 years to quantify pavement damage. This paper describes a relative wear assessment method which allows assessment of the relative impact of new proposed heavy vehicles on road pavements compared with existing heavy vehicles. The method includes the following three analyses (i) a 3 -dimensional vehicle model to estimate vertical and horizontal forces generated by a vehicle on pavement structure, (ii) a 3 -dimensional finite element pavement model to estimate the structural response and performance of a representative pavement under the imposed vehicle loadings, and (iii) a relative wear concept to assess the relative wear of various pavement components based on the outputs from the vehicle model and pavement model.

40|$|This {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} the observed performance of pavement materials subjected to multiple-axle loading {{can be used to}} improve the way flexible pavement design procedures consider the damage caused by different <b>axle</b> <b>group</b> and load combinations. Australian flexible pavement design procedures are used as the basis for considering this improvement. Fundamental to the Australian design procedures are established equal damage loads for each type of multiple-axle group. This study determined that the derivation of these equal damage loads was more heavily influenced by numerical calculations based upon assumed behaviour than on experimental data. It was also found that international design methods are similarly based upon assumed response-to-load behaviour of modelled pavement structures. In contrast, this thesis utilises performance data {{in order to determine the}} relative damage caused by different axle group-types and loads. In new work, the effects of multiple-axle loads on three pavement material types were examined. Accelerated pavement testing was used to assess the deformation of unbound granular pavements with a thin bituminous surfacing. It was determined that a 180 kN triaxle group caused 0. 8 to 1. 0 times the damage caused by a 80 kN single axle. Assuming a load-damage exponent of 4, the results confirmed that interaction between the axles of a multiple-axle group did not affect the deformation damage caused to the pavements. New consideration of an existing laboratory-based asphalt fatigue damage model - developed by others - demonstrated that there was no damaging or ameliorating effect of grouping strain pulses used to simulate multiple-axle groups. A similar laboratory-based study was undertaken to examine the effects of grouping load pulses on the flexural fatigue performance of a cemented material. Analysis of the resultant data demonstrated that damage was not affected by grouping pulses of equal load. Parametric three-dimensional finite element method and layer linear-elastic analyses indicted that the pavement structure plays a significant role in determining loads for multiple-axle groups that cause the same asphalt and cemented material fatigue damage as a Standard Axle load. Consequently, the summed-peaks pavement design model for determining the damage to a bound material resulting from an <b>axle</b> <b>group</b> with specific load was proposed. An improved design procedure based upon this model was proposed. The procedure specifically calculates the pavement damage resulting from each axle grouping type and each load within a traffic load distribution. An examination of the implications of design outcomes in using this improved procedure determined that reductions in both asphalt and cemented material thicknesses of up to 50 mm would result. These differences are significant, and represent improved material and construction cost savings - potentially of the order of A$ 50 million a year. A determination of the overall reliability of pavements that are constructed in accordance with the improved procedure is needed to fully implement the improved procedure. Future work should also consider the use of the summed-peaks model with the subgrade compressive strains used in current mechanistic design...|$|E
