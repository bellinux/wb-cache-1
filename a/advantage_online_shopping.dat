Customers’ evaluation is important to <b>online</b> <b>shops,</b> because when <b>online</b> <b>shops</b> meet the customers’ needs, it will bring big profit to the <b>online</b> <b>shop.</b> In order to open the owning logistics/ transport department successfully, the <b>online</b> <b>shops</b> must realise which factor {{will be the most}} attracted to customers. This research is done by survey investigation, the questionnaire is put in the website, it is convenient for respondents to fulfill it, and there are 203 respondents finished it. The questionnaire is designed by multiple choice and 5 -point Likert scale to test the opinion of the respondents. The correlation and regression will be used to analyse the result to find out which factor is the most attracted to customers. The factor will be the competitive <b>advantage</b> when <b>online</b> <b>shops</b> open the own logistics/ transport department. The main factors will attract customer are delivery speed, delivery cost, service quality and online shops’ brand loyalty.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to identify what determinants influence an individual consumer's intention to adopt <b>online</b> <b>shopping.</b> One of the main branches of Internet business is <b>online</b> <b>shopping.</b> In academic literature, <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> is often studied as a new retailing channel in marketing literature. By viewing <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> as a new kind of IT, this paper attempted to explain and predict customers' intention of adopting <b>online</b> <b>shopping.</b> Ten proposed hypotheses were then empirically tested by using data collected from survey. The results indicate that the relative <b>advantage</b> of <b>online</b> <b>shopping,</b> the compatibility of <b>online</b> <b>shopping,</b> the voluntariness of individual consumer's doing <b>online</b> <b>shopping,</b> customers' prior experience, and consumer innovativeness are positively correlated with individual consumer's intention of adopting <b>online</b> <b>shopping.</b> On contrary, both the transaction cost involved in purchasing goods online and a customer's sensitivity to risk have negative correlation relationship with his/her adoption intention.

40|$|The {{success of}} {{electronic}} commerce (e-commerce) sites {{that cater to}} <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> is dependent upon a number of factors, such as the quality, variety and price of their prod-ucts, their guarantees, return policies, etc. The success of these sites is predicated upon the more basic assumption that consumers can actually find the sites on the World Wide Web. A major <b>advantage</b> of <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> is that it enables consumers to engage in comparison shopping with an ease that cannot be replicated easily in the physical world. This paper examines {{the ways in which}} six Internet search engines facilitate access to <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> sites via their hierarchical subject directories. Specifically, the paper examines the internal structure, consistency and orientation of the six subject directories.

40|$|As the Internet and <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> {{is growing}} at a very fast pace worldwide, {{investigating}} this phenomenon within a South African context is crucial considering {{that it is a}} relatively new trend in this country. Typical of new trends and phenomena is the absence of research already conducted, resulting in a lack of existing literature. Very few studies have examined the factors and reasons that entice South Africans to utilise this modern shopping channel, and even less have used an in-depth, qualitative approach. To assist in filling this void, this research study examines people’s reasons for taking up or not taking up <b>online</b> <b>shopping,</b> from a South African perspective. A snowball sampling method was used to identify participants fitting the predetermined sample criteria and in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with all participants. The theoretical approach used in the analysis was social constructionism. Findings are presented by means of constructions identified during the data analysis, and these indicated that saving time, the convenience of products being increasingly available and accessible and being able to make price comparisons easily are the main <b>advantages</b> of <b>online</b> <b>shopping.</b> Main disadvantages were not being able to touch and feel products, and the absence of a salesperson.

40|$|The large {{majority}} of online grocery shoppers are multichannel shoppers, who keep visiting offline grocery stores to combine convenience <b>advantages</b> of <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> with self-service <b>advantages</b> of offline stores. An important retail management question, therefore, is how these consumers divide grocery purchases across the retailer’s online and offline channel. We provide a comprehensive analysis {{of the impact of}} category characteristics on the allocation pattern of multichannel grocery shoppers, and find that category allocation decisions are not only affected by marketing mix differences between the online and offline channel, but also by intrinsic category characteristics like perceived purchase risk and shopping convenience. In addition, we examine the effect of online buying experience. In line with expectations, we find that it can affect allocation patterns in different ways: (i) it attenuates the perceived risk of buying sensory categories online, thereby reducing differences in online category share, (ii) it reinforces marketing mix (assortment) effects, thereby making online category share differences more pronounced, and (ii) it has no effect for factors such as promotions that are easy to evaluate without experience, thereby leaving the online category share stable. In addition to different experience effects across allocation factors, we also observe variations in experience effects across consumer segments. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|One <b>advantage</b> of <b>shopping</b> <b>online</b> {{is being}} able to quickly seek out deals for items or {{services}} provided by many different vendors (though some local search engines do exist to help consumers locate products for sale in nearby stores). Search engines, online price comparison services and discovery shopping engines can be used to look up sellers of a particular product or service. Shipping costs (if applicable) reduce the price <b>advantage</b> of <b>online</b> merchandise, though depending on the jurisdiction, a lack of sales tax may compensate for this. Shipping a small number of items, especially from another country, is much more expensive than making the larger shipments bricks-and-mortar retailers order. Some retailers (especially those selling small, high-value items like electronics) offer free shipping on sufficiently large orders. Another major advantage for retailers is the ability to rapidly switch suppliers and vendors without disrupting users' shopping experience.|$|R

The following research questions will be addressed in the study. What is Asda’s approach to innovation? What are the mechanisms deployed to the stores for innovation? Examine the relationship between employees at Asda headquarters and Asda stores. Prior to the study existing literature within the retail industry will illustrate currently how the industry is shaped and how the leading firms are successful. Following on from this the study is guided by the innovation audit framework which enables firms to monitor and evaluate existing innovative practices within Asda. The innovation audit consists of five key points which are strategy, learning, building organisations, process and linkages. Semi structured interviews were formed through the innovation audit to interview the participants. From the researcher’s findings there is discontentment between the employees at Asda headquarters and employees within the Asda stores.

General themes established from the study suggested that while Asda is a successful firm; it is transparent that Asda’s competitive strategies, processes and networks formed to support innovative practices are inconsistent. Inconsistent communication and knowledge from management to employees is inaccurate or non-existent. Consequently, Asda lack the transparent innovative capabilities to be able to sustain innovative practices. Discussions will be formed to analyse how and why Asda may have developed inconsistent innovative practices, thereafter viable solutions to support Asda in terms of achieving competitive advantage through innovation will be discusse...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The U. S. Bureau of the Census (2010) {{expects that}} the older {{population}} will constitute about 20 {{percent of the total}} U. S. population in 2050. With rapidly increasing numbers in the older population, the older market has attracted attention from fashion retailers because of their higher purchasing power. In spite of the importance of older consumers in the fashion market, there has been little research of the apparel shopping of older consumers. In particular, few studies have been conducted on older women 2 ̆ 7 s <b>online</b> apparel <b>shopping.</b> Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to explore older women 2 ̆ 7 s experiences with <b>online</b> apparel <b>shopping</b> and to increase understanding of how older women <b>shop</b> for apparel <b>online.</b> The qualitative study was designed to explore how older women <b>shop</b> for apparel <b>online.</b> In-depth, face-to-face interviews and observations were conducted with 13 women who were 66 to 73 years of age and had experience purchasing apparel products online at least three times within the last two years. Most women included in this study were active online shoppers, and they have had positive experiences purchasing apparel products online. They did not have substantial problems with <b>online</b> apparel <b>shopping,</b> and they felt comfortable with it. Participants were motivated to do <b>online</b> apparel <b>shopping</b> because of the <b>advantages</b> of <b>online</b> <b>shopping,</b> such as convenience, lower prices, and variety of product offerings. They also were motivated to do <b>online</b> apparel <b>shopping</b> by other shopping channels, including mailed catalogs and stores. Their <b>online</b> apparel <b>shopping</b> was often more intentional than it would have been in a store where more browsing might occur. All the participants in this study were concerned about the fit and size of garments when they did <b>online</b> apparel <b>shopping</b> due to the inconsistency of sizes among brands. They also were concerned about the accuracy of information in websites, the return process, and the security of electronic payments. The participants 2 ̆ 7 purchase decisions for apparel online were directly associated with their concerns about <b>online</b> apparel <b>shopping.</b> Participants were more willing to buy apparel online when they knew what size they needed. They could reduce their concerns regarding fit and size of garments through online consumers 2 ̆ 7 reviews and ratings. Shipping information and a good return policy also had a significant impact on their decision whether to buy apparel online or not. The features of the websites (e. g., interactive technologies and product suggestions) were positively associated with their intentions for shopping and purchasing apparel products online and from specific websites. Furthermore, patterns of <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> behavior and suggestions for online fashion retailers were revealed from the observations, which the researcher collected when the participants went through an apparel shopping website of their choosing. In the present study older women had similar motivations for and concerns with <b>online</b> apparel <b>shopping</b> as did younger consumers, but they had some different shopping patterns from those of younger consumers for <b>online</b> apparel <b>shopping</b> (e. g., needs, styles, sizes, and possibly search and ordering patterns).

40|$|<b>Online</b> travel <b>shopping</b> has {{attracted}} researchers {{due to its}} significant growth {{and there is a}} growing body of literature in this field. However, research on what drives consumers to purchase travel online has typically been fragmented. In fact, existing studies have largely concentrated on examining consumers’ online travel purchases either grounded on Davis’s Technology Acceptance Model, on the Theory of Reasoned Action and its extension, the Theory of Planned Behaviour or on Roger’s model of perceived innovation attributes, the Innovation Diffusion Theory. A thorough literature review has revealed that {{there is a lack of}} studies that integrate all theories to better understand <b>online</b> travel <b>shopping.</b> Therefore, based on relevant literature in tourism and consumer behaviour, this study proposes and tests an integrated model to explore which factors affect intentions to purchase travel online. Furthermore, it proposes a new construct, termed social media involvement, defined as a person’s level of interest or emotional attachment with social media, and examines its relationship with intentions to purchase travel online. To test the 18 hypotheses, a quantitative approach was followed by first collecting data through an online survey. With a sample of 1, 732 Worldwide Internet users, Partial Least Squares analysis was than conducted to assess the validity and reliability of the data and empirically test the hypothesized relationships between the constructs. The results indicate that intentions to purchase travel online is mostly determined by attitude towards <b>online</b> <b>shopping,</b> which is influenced by perceived relative <b>advantages</b> of <b>online</b> travel <b>shopping</b> and trust in <b>online</b> travel <b>shopping.</b> In addition, the findings indicate that the second most important predictor of intentions to purchase travel online is compatibility, an attribute from the Innovation Diffusion Theory. Furthermore, even though <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> is nowadays a common practice, perceived risk continues to negatively affect intentions to purchase travel online. The most surprising finding of this study was that Internet users more involved with social media for travel purposes did not have higher intentions to purchase travel online.

There were so many existing researches on the relationship between consumer characteristic and <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> attitude and intention, but few togethered the different abstract levels of consumer characteristic in one research. In this study, 3 M Model was introduced as theory guide of whole research work, the Chinese consumers who knew about the <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> was the research object, questionnaire survey was used to collect the data, different abstract levels of consumer characteristic were togethered in a hierarchical model, tried to establish a model to explain the relationship between different abstract levels of consumer characteristic and <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> attitude and intention. In addition, the study also compared the models posed by data from different consumer groups. The results showed that: First, consumers’ openness, need for arousal, assessment of <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> experience, perceived risk of <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> would affect their <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> attitude and <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> intention. Second, openness, need for arousal indirectly influenced the <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> intention through the perceived risk of <b>online</b> <b>shopping.</b> Third, the perceived risk of <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> indirectly influenced the <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> intention through <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> attitude.

40|$|Most prior {{empirical}} <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> research studied consumer purchase behaviour and post-purchase behaviour {{from the}} perceived benefit/value perspective. However, few efforts {{have attempted to}} employ the cost concept to analyse consumers’ online behaviour. Researchers in psychology, marketing, and organizational behaviour have applied the transaction cost (TC) construct to study how the TCs influence the managers’ decision-making process at the organizational level. At the individual consumer level, TC consideration has become increasingly important in affecting the way consumers choose shopping channel and vendors in their daily lives. Nevertheless, little research attention {{has been devoted to}} understanding how the individual consumers’ online purchase and post-purchase behaviours are affected by their perceived TCs. This study therefore represents a point of departure in that it brings in TCs to explain online behaviour at the individual online shopper level. By extending TCs from traditional <b>shopping</b> to <b>online</b> <b>shopping,</b> this study develops an integrative model of consumer TCs associated with <b>shopping</b> at an <b>online</b> store, based on which hypotheses regarding the salient antecedents and consequences of consumer TCs were developed. The research was undertaken in China, in which the economy, particularly the <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> industry, has been increasing rapidly. China has also a unique cultural and institutional setting when compared to other countries although existing research based on China is limited. This research is therefore expected to shed light on consumer TCs of <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> within the Chinese context. Data for the study was collected using an on-street survey conducted on a face-to-face basis in one economically developed city and one economically less-developed city randomly selected from the pool of coastal cities and inland cities of China, respectively. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling (AMOS 20. 0) and multiple group analysis. Results of the study indicate that consumer TCs consisting of pre-, contemporaneous-, and post-TCs are derived from three major aspects, namely consumer-related characteristics, online store- and product-related characteristics, and online channelrelated characteristics. The consumer-related characteristics, including Internet access availability, perceived Internet expertise, and online buying frequency, are found to negatively affect consumer TCs. The online store- and product- related characteristics, consisting of e-service quality and reputation of online store, can significantly lower consumer TCs. In the last category of online channel-related characteristics, the results confirm that privacy and security concerns increase consumer TCs whereas perceived convenience largely reduces consumer TCs. As for the consequences of consumer TCs, online purchase behaviour and customer loyalty are found to be directly affected by TCs. Further, the results reveal that though TCs have direct and negative effects on customer loyalty, part of their effects is conditional on their ability to reduce customer satisfaction. That is, though lower TCs in online purchasing activities could help gain customer loyalty, such relationship is subject to the mediating effects of customer satisfaction in <b>online</b> <b>shopping.</b> Additionally, results of the study imply that as consumers’ inherent attributes, consumer’s risk-bearing propensity confounds the effects of TCs on customer loyalty, and perceived enjoyment of <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> moderates the effect of TCs on online purchase behaviour. Finally, the results suggest that the different product categories affect TCs itself as well as the effects of the antecedents on TCs. Product categories further influence the relationships between TCs and subsequent online behaviour. This study advances the consumer behaviour literature by taking a new perspective of TC mechanisms in online consumers’ decision-making. It offers deeper theoretical and empirical insights into online purchase and post-purchase behaviour by explicating the role of TCs at the individual consumer level and exploring a comprehensive set of antecedents of TCs. This study also has important practical implications. From the consumer’s perspective, this research brings benefits to individual consumers by informing them about the <b>advantages</b> of <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> which can reduce their time and cognitive effort expended on shopping and consequently lower their TCs of <b>online</b> <b>shopping.</b> In addition, the research findings provide online vendors with a deeper understanding on the allocation of resources and capabilities in achieving minimum consumer TCs and inducing favourable behavioural outcomes...|$|R

40|$|E-commerce in general, and <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> in particular, are {{becoming}} popular ways of utilizing the Internet throughout the world. Social media is also becoming a widespread tool, {{not only for}} interaction with others but also for marketing. Despite this trend, there is a dearth {{of knowledge about the}} acceptance of <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> and the use of social media in developing countries such as Saudi Arabia. Technology adoption levels in Saudi Arabia are growing rapidly but have yet to reach their full potential. One of the leading theories explaining <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> behaviour – the <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> acceptance model (OSAM) – has not been employed in previous studies of social media use or in developing countries such as Saudi Arabia to understand <b>online</b> <b>shopping.</b> To address this research problem, the researcher implemented a study using a positivist approach. Quantitative data was gathered using an online survey. This survey was conducted with Saudi residents who engage with <b>online</b> <b>shopping.</b> A data set of 423 completed survey responses is used in this thesis for statistical analysis. The data was collected using a random sample and was collected from January to September 2015. The structural equation modelling tested the hypothesised relationships between the constructs as postulated in the model. Nineteen of the hypothesised links were supported and ten were rejected. Eventually, the model that has statistical and explanatory power was confirmed. The findings indicate a positive relationship between <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> intention and other factors of online shopping acceptance in Saudi Arabia. A positive relationship is also seen between <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> orientation and <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> experience. The case examines the relationship between <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> orientation and <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> motivation. The same applies for the relationship between <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> and social media through the mediation of <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> intention. This research contributes to understanding the role of social media in OSAM in Saudi Arabia as a developing country, as OSAM incorporates social media as a new factor that influences acceptance aside from what is traditionally stipulated. A second contribution is the finding that shopping orientation is the most important construct affecting <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> intention in Saudi Arabia...|$|R
