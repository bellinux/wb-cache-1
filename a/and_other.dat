40|$|TRANSMISSIBLE spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a {{group of}} fatal {{neurodegenerative}} diseases in which an abnormal isoform of the cellular prion protein (PrPSc) accumulates in tissues of the central nervous system. Accumulation of PrPSc occurs in the retina, a rostral projection of the central nervous system, of both natural and nonnatural host species with TSEs (Foster <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1999, Spraker <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2002, Head <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2003, 2005, Hamir <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2004, 2005, Kercher <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2004, Greenlee <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2006, Hortells <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2006). In retinas from scrapie-affected sheep, PrPSc accumulation is primarily observed in {{the inner and outer}} plexiform layers, and in the ganglion cell layer (Jeffrey <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2001, Greenlee <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2006). Recent studies have reported few (Hortells <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2006) or no (Greenlee <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2006) histological lesions in the retinas of sheep affected with scrapie. However, morphological changes in specific retinal cell types have been demonstrated (Smith <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2008). Despite the morphological consequences of retinal PrPSc accumulation in sheep (Barnett and Palmer 1971, Smith <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2008), the functional impact on the retina of these animals is unknown.

40|$|RENAL {{dysplasia}} (RD) is {{a developmental}} disorder of the renal parenchyma characterised by anomalous differentiation of the nephrons and collecting ducts (Woolf <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2004). In human medicine, RD {{is one of}} the principal causes of childhood end-stage renal failure. In veterinary medicine, it has been described in several species, including cattle (Dunham <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1989, Simon <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1999, Ohba <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2001, Castro <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2007, Maxie <b>and</b> Newman 2007, Aresu <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2009, Philbey <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2009).

These mutations affect {{one of the members of}} the claudin family of genes which plays an important role in the formation of tight junctions in the kidney (Simon <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1999).
