Statistical design of experiments was used to help develop an efficient and scalable process for electrodeposition of platinum with a specific electrochemical surface area of over 25 m 2 /g. Catalyst surface area and activity were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry, and the material microstructure and morphology were investigated using x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy.

In this work, we directly grew hierarchical mixed NiCu layered hydroxides (LHs) nanowires on carbon fibre cloth electrodes by a facile one-step hydrothermal synthesis method for efficient electro-oxidation of ammonia. This catalyst achieves a current density of 35 mA cm− 2 at 0. 55 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which {{is much higher than}} that of bare Ni(OH) 2 catalyst (5 mA cm− 2).

40|$|Masters of ScienceThe {{electrochemical}} oxidation of ammonia has {{attracted much attention}} as an efficient green method for application in direct <b>ammonia</b> <b>fuel</b> cells (DAFCs) {{and the production of}} high purity hydrogen. However, the insufficient performance and high costs of platinum has hindered the large scale application of ammonia (NH₃) electro-oxidation technologies. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} the fabrication of efficient electrocatalysts for NH₃ electrooxidation with improved activity and lower Pt loading. Owing to their unique catalytic properties, nanoalloys of platinum group metals (PGMs) are being designated as possible electrocatalysts for NH₃ oxidation. This study presents for the first time a chemical synthesis of unsupported ternary PGM based nanoalloys such as Cu@Pt@Ir with multi-shell structures and Cu-Pt-Ir mixed nanoalloys for electro-catalysis of NH 3 oxidation. The nanoalloys were stabilised with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the capping agent. The structural properties of the nanoalloys were studied using ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) and fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopic techniques. The elemental composition, average particle size and morphology of the materials were evaluated by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) coupled to energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. High resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) was used for morphological characterisation. Additionally, scanning auger nanoprobe microscopy (NanoSAM) was employed to provide high performance auger (AES) spectral analysis and auger imaging of complex multi-layered Cu@Pt@Ir nanoalloy surface. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy was used to investigate the crystallinity of the nanoalloys. The electrochemistry of the nanoalloy materials was interrogated with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV). The electrocatalytic activity of novel Cu-Pt-Ir trimetallic nanoalloys for the oxidation of ammonia was tested using CV. UV-Vis spectroscopy confirmed the complete reduction of the metal precursors to the respective nanoparticles. FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of the PVP polymer as well as formation of a bond between the polymer (PVP) chains and the metal surface for all nanoparticles (NPs). Furthermore, HRTEM confirmed that the small irregular interconnected PVP stabilised Cu@Pt@Ir NPs were about 5 nm in size. The elemental composition of the alloy nanoparticles measured using EDX also confirmed the presence of Cu, Pt and Ir. Cyclic voltammetry indicated that both the GCE|Cu-Pt-Ir NPs and GCE|Cu@Pt@Ir NPs are active electrocatalysts for NH 3 oxidation as witnessed by the formation of a well-defined anodic peak around - 0. 298 V (vs. Ag/AgCl).

The presence of the crystalline phases in each sample was confirmed by XRD analysis. The surface analysis of Cu@Pt@Ir nanoalloy with AES surveys revealed the presence of Pt, Ir and Cu elements in all probed spots suggesting some mixing between the layers of the nanoalloy.

Then, the complex interdependency among the multi-component mass transport, electron and ion transports, and the electrochemical and chemical reactions in the microstructure of electrodes is taken into account to predict the electrochemical performance of electrodes. The temperature distribution in the solid structure of the cell and the temperature and species partial pressure distributions in the bulk fuel and air streams are predicted using the cell macro-model. In the macro-model, the energy transport is considered for the cell solid structure and the mass and energy transports are considered for the fuel and air streams. To demonstrate the application of the cell level model developed, entitled the combined micro- and micro-model, several anode-supported co-flow planar cells with a range of microstructures of porous composite electrodes are simulated. The mean total polarization resistance, the mean total power density, and the temperature distribution in the cells are predicted. The results of this study reveal that there is an optimum value for most of the microstructural variables of the electrodes at which the mean total polarization resistance of the cell is minimized. There is also an optimum value for most of the microstructural variables of the electrodes at which the mean total power density of the cell is maximized. The microstructure of porous composite electrodes also plays {{a significant role in the}} mean temperature, the temperature difference between the hottest and coldest spots, and the maximum temperature gradient in the solid structure of the cell. Overall, using the combined micro- and micro-model, an appropriate microstructure for porous composite electrodes to enhance the cell performance can be designed. At the system level, the full load operation of two SOFC systems is studied. To model these systems, the basic cell model is used for SOFCs at the cell level, the repeated-cell stack model is used for SOFCs at the stack level, and the thermodynamic model is used for the balance of plant components of the system. In addition to these models, a carbon deposition model based on the thermodynamic equilibrium assumption is employed. For the system level model, the first SOFC system considered is a combined heat and power (CHP) system that operates with biogas fuel. The performance of this system at three different configurations is evaluated. These configurations are different in the fuel processing method to prevent carbon deposition on the anode catalyst. The fuel processing methods considered in these configurations are the anode gas recirculation (AGR), steam reforming (SR), and partial oxidation reformer (POX) methods. The application of this system is studied for operation in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and in single-family detached dwellings. The evaluation of this system for operation in a WWTP indicates that if the entire biogas produced in the WWTP is used in the system with AGR or SR fuel processors, the electric power and heat required to operate the plant can be completely supplied and the extra electric power generated can be sold to the electrical grid. The evaluation of this system for operation in single-family detached dwellings indicates that, depending on the size, location, and building type and design, this system with all configurations studied is suitable to provide the domestic hot water and electric power demands. The second SOFC system is a novel portable electric power generation system that operates with liquid <b>ammonia</b> <b>fuel.</b> Size, simplicity, and high electrical efficiency are the main advantages of this environmentally friendly system. Using a sensitivity analysis, the effects of the cell voltage at several fuel utilization ratios on the number of cells required for the SOFC stack, system efficiency and voltage, and excess air required for thermal management of the SOFC stack are studied...|$|E

The ammonia borane (AB) oxidation reaction was studied by cyclic voltammetry at the NPG electrodes. The onset {{potential for the}} oxidation at NPG in a wire array format shifted to more negative potentials than that observed at a Au disc and higher currents were realised. An onset potential of - 1. 30 V vs. SCE was recorded which is 0. 28 V lower than that at a Au disc. The oxidation current for 20 mM AB in 1 M NaOH increased from 2. 65 mA cm(- 2) at a Au disc to 13. 1 mA cm(- 2) at a NPG wire array.

40|$|Three {{simulated}} {{coal gas}} fuels based on hydrogen and carbon monoxide were tested during an experimental evaluation {{with a rich}} lean can combustor: these were a simulated Winkler gas, Lurgi gas and Blue Water gas. All three were simulated by mixing together the necessary pure component species, to levels typical of fuel gases produced from coal. The Lurgi gas was also evaluated with <b>ammonia</b> addition. <b>Fuel</b> burning in a rich lean mode was emphasized. Only the Blue Water gas, however, could be operated in such fashion. This showed that the expected NOx signature form could be obtained, although the absolute values of NOx were above the 75 ppm goals for most operating conditions. Lean combustion produced very low NOx well below 75 ppm with the Winkler and Lurgi gases. In addition, these low levels were not significantly impacted by changes in operating conditions...|$|R
