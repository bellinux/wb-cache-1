5|$|His fourth {{minister}} of economy, Domingo Cavallo, was appointed in 1991. He deepened the neoliberal reforms. The Convertibility plan was {{sanctioned by the}} Congress, setting a one-to-one fixed exchange rate between the United States dollar and the new Argentine peso, which replaced the Austral. The law also limited public expenditures, but this was frequently ignored. There was increased free trade to reduce inflation, and high taxes on sales and earnings {{to reduce the deficit}} caused by it. Initially, the plan was a success: the capital flights ended, interest and inflation rates were lowered, and economic activity increased. The money from privatizations allowed Argentina to repurchase many of the Brady Bonds issued during the crisis. The privatizations of electricity, water, and gas were more successful than previous ones. YPF, the national oil refinery, was privatized as well, but the state kept <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shares. The project to privatize the pension funds was resisted in Congress, and was approved as a mixed system that allowed both public and private options for workers. The national state also signed a fiscal pact with the provinces, so that they reduced their local deficits as well. Buenos Aires Province was helped with a fund that gave the governor a million pesos daily.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{writing for}} the first season was split between the Wachowskis and Straczynski. The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> writing was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski {{believes}} writing with the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party {{to learn from the}} other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, he views himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works is by first developing the entire script in his head, from the first sentence to the last, before sitting down to write it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes they have already developed, leaving the others they haven't figured out yet for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in which way they work best.|$|E

25|$|A further {{significant}} finding of Preston's {{study was that}} the curve has shifted upwards during the 20th century. This means that life expectancy has increased in most countries, independently of changes in income. Preston credited education, better technology, vaccinations, improved provision of public health services, oral rehydration therapy and better nutrition with these exogenous improvements in health. According to Preston, the independent increases in life expectancy have been greatest in the poor countries, although he also believed that <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential gains from better medical technology have not been realized. Several poor countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have actually seen declines in life expectancy in the 1990s and 2000s {{as a result of}} the HIV/AIDS epidemic, even if their per capita incomes have increased during this time.|$|E
25|$|Although {{one female}} {{typically}} dominates the reproduction on one colony, {{there is strong}} evidence for co-foundress behavior among P. alternata. Occasionally, the founding of new colonies occurs from the cooperation of two or females. The females stay on the nest for <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day but rarely interact. Both co-foundresses contribute {{to the construction of}} the nest and overall protection of the colony. Though the associated females share many responsibilities equally, there is evidence that female foundresses with larger ovaries spend more time off the nest, indicating some type of hierarchy based on reproductive ability. One advantage in associative nesting is increased offspring. The more foundresses present in a nest, the more cells and eggs are produced. Also, the presence of more than one female improves active defense of the nest.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 8th century BC, Greeks {{arrived in}} Italy and founded cities {{along the coast}} of {{southern}} Italy and eastern Sicily, which became known as Magna Graecia ("Greater Greece"). The Greeks were frequently at war with the native Italic tribes, but nonetheless managed to Hellenize and assimilate <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indigenous population located along eastern Sicily and the Southern coasts of the Italian mainland. According to Beloch the number of Greek citizens in south Italy at its greatest extent reached only 80,000–90,000, while the local people subjected by the Greeks were between 400,000–600,000. By the 4th and 3rd century BC, Greek power in Italy was challenged and began to decline, and many Greeks were pushed out of peninsular Italy by the native Oscan, Brutti and Lucani tribes.|$|E

25|$|Located a short {{distance}} outside the city center is another art museum called the Museo Muros (Avenida Vicente Guerrero 205, Colonia Lomas de Selva). This museum exhibits the art collection of Jacques and Natasha Gelman. Jacques, a Russian émigré, made his fortune as the producer of hit comedies by the legendary Mexican comic, Cantinflas. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> money he made went into the acquisition of art, which he collected for half a century. Works by Rivera, Kahlo, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Francisco Toledo, Rufino Tamayo, Cisco Jimenez, Gerardo Suter, and Juan Soriano are among the works that could be found there. This museum was closed in 2008. Opened in its place is the Papalote museo del niño an interactive children's museum with up to thirty exhibitions and artistic experiences for children, such as Mindball, Kandinsky Rug, Gigantic Piano, and others.|$|E
25|$|Cast iron {{development}} lagged in Europe, as the smelters {{could only}} achieve temperatures of about 1000 C; {{or perhaps they}} did not want hotter temperatures, as they were seeking to produce blooms as a precursor of wrought iron, not cast iron. Through <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages, in Western Europe, iron was still being made by the working of iron blooms into wrought iron. Some of the earliest casting of iron in Europe occurred in Sweden, in two sites, Lapphyttan and Vinarhyttan, between 1150 and 1350. Some scholars have speculated the practice followed the Mongols across Russia to these sites, but there is no clear proof of this hypothesis, and it would certainly not explain the pre-Mongol datings of many of these iron-production centres. In any event, by the late 14th century, a market for cast iron goods began to form, as a demand developed for cast iron cannonballs.|$|E

Veteran backup Mike Dunham, an experienced number-one netminder, stepped in, but also promptly injured himself only a few games later; this left only prospects Michael Garnett and Adam Berkhoel to tend goal. Journeyman goaltender Steve Shields was signed, but he too was injured within ten games. On April 6, Lehtonen was run into by Tampa Bay's Chris Dingman, injuring him yet again. The remainder of the season was left to Dunham. Garnett was injured in a game against the Washington Capitals. Dunham, who had started the game but was relieved by the young rookie after poor play, was forced back into action in the third period.|$|E

25|$|The Matterhorn has a {{pyramidal}} {{shape with}} four faces nearly facing the four compass points. Three of them (north, east and west) {{are on the}} Swiss {{side of the border}} and watershed (Mattertal valley) and one of them (south) is on the Italian side of the border (Valtournenche valley). The north face overlooks the Ober Gabelhorn (7km away) across the Zmutt Glacier and valley (above Zermatt), the east face overlooks the Gorner Glacier system between the Gornergrat and Monte Rosa (respectively 10 and 17km away) across the Theodul Pass, the west face overlooks the upper basin of the Zmutt Glacier between the Dent Blanche and the Dent d'Hérens (respectively 7 and 4km away) and the south face fronts the resort town of Breuil-Cervinia and overlooks <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Valtournenche. The Matterhorn does not form a perfect square pyramid, as the north and south faces are wider than the west and east faces.

25|$|In March 1551, her {{condition}} improved somewhat {{and she was}} able to receive a messenger from Bona Sforza who informed her that Bona recognized her marriage to Sigismund Augustus.

Sigismund Augustus personally tended to his sick wife even though reportedly she stank of pus. He wanted to take her to Niepołomice where he hoped that spring weather would lessen her suffering. When there was a doubt whether a special wagon to transport Barbara could fit through the city gates, Sigismund Augustus ordered the gate demolished. Barbara died on 8 May 1551 in Kraków. She asked to be buried in Vilnius and her body was transported to Vilnius Cathedral, where she was buried on 23 June next to Sigismund Augustus' first wife Elizabeth of Austria. Her death was a severe loss to the King; it is said that for <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> journey he followed her coffin on foot.

25|$|Kollam is {{the largest}} pencil slat {{manufacturing}} hub in India. There are more than 150 slat production units in the city employing roughly 5,000 persons. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demand for pencil slats {{in the country is}} met by these units. 35% of the world's pencil slats are manufactured in Kerala. Of the 170 odd pencil slat manufacturing units in Kerala, 125 are based in and around Kollam district. These units export 160 loads of slats per month to companies across the world. This, according to slat manufacturers, is enough to make 200 million pencils per month. A slat is of 185mm length, 77mm width and 5.5mm thickness. Each load exported contains 300 bags with 900 slats bundled into each. On an average each month 150 loads of pencil slats are shipped to pencil factories based in Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai and various places in Gujarat. Over 30 countries depend on Kollam's pencil slat manufacturers for pencil making under different brand names. These factories are working with the support of their associations: the Kerala Slats Factories Association and the Kerala State Small Industries Association (KSSIA).
