[...] She recalled, [...] "His personality was changing and his ideology was changing and he <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> attend church with us. I {{felt like it was}} because of the negative influence of this person." [...] According to the Daily Mail, Bednar had been introduced to the 'exclusive' six-person online gaming club at a church youth group. Bednar's mother described Lewis Daynes as controlling the group, with the power to expel members, owning and controlling an Internet chat channel on which members would communicate by voice. She told the Daily Mail that Daynes had told her son improbable stories, such as donating $2.5 million in bitcoins to Syrian rebels and had told members they did not need to finish school because he would arrange £100,000 computer technology jobs for them.|$|R
5000|$|Ridge Wood {{began his}} winning {{run in the}} City of Birmingham Cup at Birmingham Racecourse and then won the Sandringham Stakes and the Commonwealth Stakes, both at Sandown. The colt then {{returned}} to Birmingham on 8 August for the Midlands St Leger Trial in which his only rival was a colt named Courier. Murless had instructed champion jockey Gordon Richards {{not to make the}} running on Ridge Wood, but Courier's rider had been given identical instructions, and when race <b>was</b> <b>started,</b> both <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> begin racing. When the racecourse starter's assistant brandished a large whip behind the horses the [...] "contest" [...] began at a walk and continued as a [...] "tortoise race" [...] for six furlongs with the crowd loudly voicing their disapproval. The race eventually began in earnest, and Ridge Wood recorded his fourth consecutive win by three lengths. On his final start before the St Leger, Ridge Wood was moved up in class and won the Oxfordshire Stakes over thirteen furlongs at Newbury. In this race he was ridden again by the champion jockey Gordon Richards and won at odds of 4/9.|$|R

50|$|Although officially {{a part of}} Cornell, {{the school}} {{remained}} financially independent of the University, with Cornell providing only the salary of the Dean. The rest of the funding came from state and federal sources, tuition, and the daily charges billed to patients staying in the New York Hospital. In the mid-1970s insurance companies <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> reimburse nursing education expenses {{as a part of}} hospital charges and federal funding also declined. This led to the closing of the school in 1979.|$|R

50|$|Above all, Vivien romanticized death. While visiting London in 1908, deeply despondent and ruinously in debt, {{she tried}} to kill herself by {{drinking}} an excess of laudanum. She stretched out on her divan with a bouquet of violets held over her heart. The suicide failed, but while in England, she contracted pleurisy; later, upon her return to Paris, she grew considerably weaker. According to biographer Jean-Paul Goujon, Vivien suffered from chronic gastritis, due to years of chloral hydrate and alcohol abuse. She had also <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> eat. By {{the time of her}} death, she weighed about 70 lbs. Multiple neuritis caused paralysis of her limbs. By the summer of 1909, she walked with a cane.|$|R
50|$|It {{remains to}} be seen what will come of the school but {{concerns}} have been published in the local media regarding the fact that all of the Catholic high schools in the vicinity are at capacity and have <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> Catholic boys admission. Apparently this has led to a crisis which is eroding the faith in the Catholic Church administration, especially given that members of the Archdiocese are complaining that the Archbishop is either not responding or not seeing letters addressed to him regarding the problem.|$|R

40|$|In Cameroon an {{interesting}} combination of traditional justice and formal (“Western”) justice has occurred. The Cameroonian formal justice system was overburdened in the 1970 ‟s by cases of goats destroying cassava fields, small unpaid loans or petty theft of fruit. In {{order to get}} the formal justice system running again the traditional councils were called upon by the government in order to try these small cases. Judges and the police <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> try these small cases and would send people to their traditional council to solve the matter. But are Cameroonians happy with this solution? The focus of this thesis will therefore not lie on how the formal justice system and traditional council work but on how they are perceived by the Cameroonian people. What is especially important is whether the formal justice system and traditional councils are seen as legitimate. In this thesis I will answer the following research puzzle: How do Cameroonians perceive the traditional councils and formal state justice system and how does this perception relate to the twilight institutions paradigm and failed states debate...|$|R
