50|$|Automation Master {{connects to}} the Control System/PLC and emulates the real world I/O by reading and writing the PLC's {{internal}} I/O images. The simulator can receive the Control System/PLC's outputs, and respond with the inputs in real time {{without the need for}} any hard-wired physical I/O.A simulator emulates the real time response to the Control System/PLC actions based upon a model which duplicates the operation of the automated system. For example, if the Control System/PLC sets a digital output to start a motor to raise a door, the model, within milliseconds, provides the Control System/PLC with an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contact</b> closure to indicate that the motor has been started. Shortly, the door closed limit switch is turned off as the door begins to rise. As long as, the Control System/PLC keeps on the output signal which raises the door, the door in the model continues to rise. When the door is fully open, the model turns on the door open limit switch, and the PLC responds by turning off the motor which raised the door. The model sees the Control System/PLC turn off the motor and drops out the motor's <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contact.</b>|$|E

50|$|Electric motors need {{overcurrent}} protection to prevent damage from over-loading the motor, or {{to protect against}} short circuits in connecting cables or internal faults in the motor windings. The overload sensing devices are a form of heat operated relay where a coil heats a bimetallic strip, or where a solder pot melts, releasing a spring to operate <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contacts.</b> These <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contacts</b> are in series with the coil. If the overload senses excess current in the load, the coil is de-energized.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes an {{economizer}} circuit is also installed {{to reduce the}} power required to keep a contactor closed; an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contact</b> reduces coil current after the contactor closes. A somewhat greater amount of power is required to initially close a contactor than is required to keep it closed. Such a circuit can save {{a substantial amount of}} power and allow the energized coil to stay cooler. Economizer circuits are nearly always applied on direct-current contactor coils and on large alternating current contactor coils.|$|E
50|$|Once a {{model of}} a {{component}} has been built, it can be executed over and over again, under varying conditions to quickly and thoroughly exercise the control software. For instance, what happens if the Control System/PLC loses the motor's <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contact</b> as the door is rising?, Does the Control System/PLC turn off the output which raises the door? Is an alarm sent to the Level II system? How does the Level II system respond? When an error is detected, the programmer can easily alter the software and retest it using the model. The automated system is debugged in real time without any wiring, switches, bells, whistles, or hassles.|$|E
50|$|Starters using {{magnetic}} contactors usually derive {{the power}} supply for the contactor coil {{from the same}} source as the motor supply. An <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contact</b> from the contactor is used to maintain the contactor coil energized after the start command for the motor has been released. If a momentary loss of supply voltage occurs, the contactor will open and not close again until a new start command is given. this prevents restarting of the motor after a power failure. This connection also provides a small degree of protection against low power supply voltage and loss of a phase. However since contactor coils will hold the circuit closed with as little as 80% of normal voltage applied to the coil, {{this is not a}} primary means of protecting motors from low voltage operation.|$|E

When the DC load (16) is shut down, the capacitor bank (14) is automatically discharged through a discharging power resistor (66) by a MOSFET transistor (60) through a discharging power resistor (66) only when both the main power <b>contacts</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contacts</b> are disconnected...|$|R

The enclosure is a frame housing the contacts and the electromagnet. Enclosures are made of insulating materials such as Bakelite, Nylon 6, and thermosetting plastics to protect and insulate the contacts and to provide some measure of protection against personnel touching the contacts. Open-frame contactors may have a further enclosure to protect against dust, oil, explosion hazards and weather.|$|R
50|$|A polarised two-pin {{unshielded}} connector, {{designed for}} connecting a loudspeaker to a power amplifier (or other device; {{many of the}} earlier shoebox style tape recorders used them), {{is known as the}} DIN 41529 loudspeaker connector. It exists as a panel-mounting female version, and line-mounted male and female versions. The male version has a central flat pin, and circular pin mounted off-centre. The circular pin is connected to the positive line (red) while the spade is connected to the negative line (black). The panel-mounting female version is available with or without an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contact</b> that disconnects the internal speaker of the device if an external speaker connector is inserted. Most common is a three-hole female connector with one circular hole {{on either side of the}} spade hole, one of them with an aux contact and one without, which provides the option to leave the internal speaker connected by inserting the plug twisted by 180°.|$|E
30|$|Three {{measurements}} were made when defects {{similar to the}} characteristics of the Brazilian power grid were applied. First, the signal, such as the circuit-breaker position, which has an influence on protection performance, should be wired directly from an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contact</b> if possible, and avoid an intermediate relay that can add an uncertain time delay. Second, a test should be launched to measure the time delay between the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contact</b> and main pole of the circuit-breaker. If the time delay is greater than 30  ms, the “close command” signal should be wired. The time delay value ensures that instrument error and the transformer time needed for the signal should be taken into account. Third, if the time delay tested is less than 30  ms, the port for wiring the “close command” signal may link directly to ground to avoid mal-operation of the dead-zone protection.|$|E
30|$|The {{recorder}} picture {{shows that}} the fault current existed for 78  ms, and the time delay between the main pole and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contact</b> was more than 36  ms. During this period, when the breaker’s main pole was “ON”, and the fault current detected by the relay was 0.77  A, which was greater than the setting value (0.1  A). Thus, the condition in logic scheme (see Fig.  2) that the current of any phase is greater than setting was considered true. Another condition indicates that the breaker position is “OFF” was also considered to be correct because the breaker position was detected by protection device as “OFF” during the time delay between the main pole and the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contact.</b> In addition, the “close command” signal had no influence on the logic because of absence, and thus dead-zone protection acted after 36  ms. This {{was consistent with the}} site situation.|$|E

40|$|Air-break {{disconnectors}} (DS) in a high-voltage network can interrupt small capacitive currents (e. g., occurring when disconnecting short unloaded transmission lines, current transformers, and so forth). The {{performance of}} a device with high-velocity opening <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contacts</b> attached to the DS enhancing the interrupting capability is presented. A series of laboratory experiments is carried out with the interrupted current range between 5 and 27 A. The experimental observations include voltage and current characteristics of the DS, and synchronous optical recording of the arc with a high-speed camera. Electrical and optical data are studied for fail and successful interruptions. The results show: 1) The short arcing time by the fast opening contacts limits the energy input into the arc, enhancing the probability of arc extinction; 2) the contribution to the arc energy mainly comes from the oscillations upon restrike. The energy input to the arc increases with higher breakdown voltage, larger air gap, and higher interrupted current; 3) the arc brightness is synchronous with arc current. With higher interrupted current, the overall arc is brighter and its remnants decay slower. Based on the results, potential successful approaches to increase the interruption capability are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Smad ubiquitination {{regulatory}} factor 2 (Smurf 2) is an E 3 ubiquitin ligase that {{participates in}} degradation of TGF-β receptors and other targets. Smurf 2 WW domains recognize PPXY (PY) motifs on ubiquitin ligase target proteins or on adapters, such as Smad 7, that bind to E 3 target proteins. We previously {{demonstrated that the}} isolated WW 3 domain of Smurf 2, but not the WW 2 domain, can directly bind to a Smad 7 PY motif. We show here that the WW 2 augments this interaction by binding to the WW 3 and making <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contacts</b> with the PY motif and a novel E/D-S/T-P motif, which is N-terminal to all Smad PY motifs. The WW 2 likely enhances the selectivity of Smurf 2 for the Smad proteins. NMR titrations confirm that Smad 1 and Smad 2 are bound by Smurf 2 with the same coupled WW domain arrangement used to bind Smad 7. The analogous WW domains in the short isoform of Smurf 1 recognize the Smad 7 PY peptide using the same coupled mechanism. However, a longer Smurf 1 isoform, which has an additional 26 residues in the inter-WW domain linker, is only partially {{able to use the}} coupled WW domain binding mechanism. The longer linker results in a decrease in affinity for the Smad 7 peptide. Interdomain coupling of WW domains enhances selectivity and enables the tuning of interactions by isoform switching...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} novel {{approach}} for dynamically simulating articulated rigid bodies undergoing frequent and unpredictable contact and collision. In order to leverage existing algorithms for nonconvex bodies, multiple collisions, large contact groups, stacking, etc., we use maximal rather than generalized coordinates and take an impulse based approach {{that allows us to}} treat articulation, contact and collision in a unified manner. Traditional constraint handling methods are subject to drift, and we propose a novel pre-stabilization method that does not require tunable potentially stiff parameters as does Baumgarte stabilization. This differs from poststabilization in that we compute allowable trajectories before moving the rigid bodies to their new positions, instead of correcting them after the fact when {{it can be difficult to}} incorporate the effects of contact and collision. A post-stabilization technique is used for momentum and angular momentum. Our approach works with any black box method for specifying valid joint constraints, and no special considerations are required for arbitrary closed loops or branching. Moreover, our implementation is linear both in the number of bodies and in the number of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contact</b> and collision constraints, unlike many other methods that are linear in the number of bodies but not in the number of auxiliary constraints...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} simulation-based algorithm, {{allowing}} the prediction of the effective mechanical properties of textiles {{on the basis of their}} microstructure and corresponding properties of fibers. This method can be used for optimization of the microstructure, in order to obtain a better stiffness or strength of the corresponding fiber material later on. An additional aspect of the thesis is that we want to take into account the microcontacts between fibers of the textile. One more aspect of the thesis is the accounting for the thickness of thin fibers in the textile. An introduction of an additional asymptotics with respect to a small parameter, the relation between the thickness and the representative length of the fibers, allows a reduction of local contact problems between fibers to 1 -dimensional problems, which reduces numerical computations significantly. A fiber composite material with periodic microstructure and multiple frictional microcontacts between fibers is studied. The textile is modeled by introducing small geometrical parameters: the periodicity of the microstructure and the characteristic diameter of fibers. The contact linear elasticity problem is considered. A two-scale approach is used for obtaining the effective mechanical properties. The algorithm using asymptotic two-scale homogenization for computation of the effective mechanical properties of textiles with periodic rod or fiber microstructure is proposed. The algorithm is based on the consequent passing to the asymptotics with respect to the in-plane period and the characteristic diameter of fibers. This allows to come to the equivalent homogenized problem and to reduce the dimension of the auxiliary problems. Further numerical simulations of the cell problems give the effective material properties of the textile. The homogenization of the boundary conditions on the vanishing out-of-plane interface of a textile or fiber structured layer has been studied. Introducing additional auxiliary functions into the formal asymptotic expansion for a heterogeneous plate, the corresponding auxiliary and homogenized problems for a nonhomogeneous Neumann boundary condition were deduced. It is incorporated into the right hand side of the homogenized problem via effective out-of-plane moduli. FiberFEM, a C++ finite element code for solving contact elasticity problems, is developed. The code is based on the implementation of the algorithm for the contact between fibers, proposed in the thesis. Numerical examples of homogenization of geotexiles and wovens are obtained in the work by implementation of the developed algorithm. The effective material moduli are computed numerically using the finite element solutions of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contact</b> problems obtained by FiberFEM...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The HRDC (helicase and RNaseD C-terminal) domain {{is found}} at the C {{terminus}} of many RecQ helicases, including the human Werner and Bloom syndrome proteins. RecQ helicases {{have been shown to}} unwind DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. However, the specific functional roles of these proteins in DNA recombination and replication are not known. An HRDC domain exists in both of the human RecQ homologues that are implicated in human disease and may have an important role in their function. RESULTS: We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the HRDC domain in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RecQ helicase Sgs 1 p by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The structure resembles auxiliary domains in bacterial DNA helicases and other proteins that interact with nucleic acids. We show that a positively charged region {{on the surface of the}} Sgs 1 p HRDC domain can interact with DNA. Structural similarities to bacterial DNA helicases suggest that the HRDC domain functions as an auxiliary domain in RecQ helicases. Homology models of the Werner and Bloom HRDC domains show different surface properties when compared with Sgs 1 p. CONCLUSIONS: The HRDC domain represents a structural scaffold that resembles auxiliary domains in proteins that are involved in nucleic acid metabolism. In Sgs 1 p, the HRDC domain could modulate the helicase function via <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contacts</b> to DNA. However, in the Werner and Bloom syndrome helicases the HRDC domain may have a role in their functional differences by mediating diverse molecular interactions...|$|R

40|$|New {{maintenance}} {{techniques for}} circuit breakers are studied in this dissertation by proposing a probabilistic maintenance model {{and a new}} methodology to assess circuit breaker condition utilizing its control circuit data. A risk-based decision approach is proposed at system level making use of the proposed new methodology, for optimizing the maintenance schedules and allocation of resources. This dissertation is focused on developing optimal maintenance strategies for circuit breakers, both at component and system level. A probabilistic maintenance model is proposed using similar approach recently introduced for power transformers. Probabilistic models give better insight into the interplay among monitoring techniques, failure modes and maintenance techniques of the component. The model {{is based on the}} concept of representing the component life time by several deterioration stages. Inspection and maintenance is introduced at each stage and model parameters are defined. A sensitivity analysis is carried to understand the importance of model parameters in obtaining optimal maintenance strategies. The analysis covers the effect of inspection rate calculated for each stage and its impact on failure probability, inspection cost, maintenance cost and failure cost. This maintenance model is best suited for long-term maintenance planning. All simulations are carried in MATLAB and how the analysis results may be used to achieve optimal maintenance schedules is discussed. A new methodology is proposed to convert data from the control circuit of a breaker into condition of the breaker by defining several performance indices for breaker assemblies. Control circuit signal timings are extracted and a probability distribution is fitted to each timing parameter. Performance indices for various assemblies such as, trip coil, close coil, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contacts</b> etc. are defined based on the probability distributions. These indices are updated using Bayesian approach as the new data arrives. This process can be made practical by approximating the Bayesian approach calculating the indices on-line. The quantification of maintenance is achieved by computing the indices after a maintenance action and comparing with those of previously estimated ones. A risk-based decision approach to maintenance planning is proposed based on the new methodology developed for maintenance quantification. A list of events is identified for the test system under consideration, and event probability, event consequence, and hence the risk associated with each event is computed. Optimal maintenance decisions are taken based on the computed risk levels for each event. Two case studies are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed new methodology for maintenance quantification. The risk-based decision approach is tested on IEEE Reliability Test System. All simulations are carried in MATLAB and the discussions of results are provided...|$|R
