5|$|At 5:30 am on April 19, {{dynamite}} {{was thrown}} through a front window of Z. Alexander Looby's home in north Nashville, apparently {{in retaliation for}} his support of the demonstrators. Although the explosion almost destroyed the house, Looby and his wife, who were <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> a back bedroom, were not injured. More than 140 windows in a nearby dormitory were broken by the blast.|$|E
5|$|Bishop Kidder {{was killed}} during the Great Storm of 1703, when two chimney stacks in the palace fell on him and his wife, while they were <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> bed. A central porch was added around 1824 and, in the 1840s and 1850s, Benjamin Ferrey {{restored}} the palace and added an upper storey. He also restored the chapel using stained glass from ruined French churches.|$|E

5|$|The resort's {{staff had}} left a note in a message book at the swimming-pool {{reception}} area, asking that the same table, which overlooked the apartments, be block-booked for 20:30 for the McCanns and friends every evening {{for the last four}} evenings of the holiday. The message said the group's children were <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> the apartments. Madeleine's mother believes the abductor may have seen the note.|$|E
5|$|The tale {{begins with}} Tommy Brock, a badger, being entertained by old Mr. Bouncer, {{the father of}} Benjamin Bunny. Mr. Bouncer has been left to tend his grandchildren while his son and daughter-in-law Flopsy are away, but, after smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, he falls <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> Tommy's company. Tommy puts the bunnies in his sack and slips out. When the parents return, Benjamin sets off {{in pursuit of the}} thief.|$|E

5|$|The {{third day}} opens with Pikachu <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> the {{cupboard}} and Oak expressing pleasure at the Pokémon's growing {{attachment to the}} player. On the fourth day, Pikachu invites its friends back over. Little else occurs on these two days besides visits to the snowy Mt. Snowfall and the tropical Cobalt Coast, although Oak does continue to laud the player's investment in the network, {{which has become a}} huge success.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin finds {{and brings}} his cousin Peter Rabbit into the rescue venture, {{and the two}} {{discover}} Tommy has invaded one of Mr. Tod's homes. Mr. Tod, a fox, has multiple homes but keeps moving. Often Tommy lodges in his homes. Peeping through the bedroom window, the rabbits see Tommy <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> Mr. Tod's bed, and, peeping through the kitchen window, they see the table set for a meal. They realise the bunnies are alive, but shut in the oven. They try to dig a tunnel into the house but hide when Mr. Tod suddenly arrives in a very bad temper, which has caused him to move house.|$|E
5|$|By {{chance he}} then runs into another man his age, {{the far more}} {{spontaneous}} Trygve Sissener, who has fallen <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> the snow-covered street. The two spend the evening in conversation over a few drinks at Sissener's house, and Odd is led to realisations about his own life. It emerges that his mothera free-spirited womanwas a ski jumper, but Odd himself never {{had the courage to}} try the sport. He now feels as if he has let her down, by never having the courage to seize the day and try new things.|$|E

40|$|Kathleen Biard, 1, 2 Alan B Douglass, 2, 3 Rébecca Robillard, 2 Joseph De Koninck 1, 2 1 School of Psychology, University of Ottawa, 2 University of Ottawa Institute for Mental Health Research, 3 Royal Ottawa Mental Health Center, University of Ottawa Institute for Mental Health Research, Ottawa, ON, Canada Rationale: The serotonergic and {{cholinergic}} {{systems are}} jointly involved in regulating sleep but {{this system is}} theorized to be disturbed in depressed individuals. We previously reported that cholinergic and serotonergic agents induce sleep changes partially consistent with monoamine models of sleep disturbances in depression. One potential cause of disturbed neurotransmission is genetic predisposition. The G(- 1019) allele of the serotonin- 1 A (5 -HT 1 A) receptor promoter region predicts an increased risk for depression compared to the wild-type C(- 1019) allele. Objective: The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate how serotonin- 1 A receptor genotypes mediate sleep sensitivity to pharmacological probes modeling the serotonergic/cholinergic imbalance of depression. Methods: Seventeen healthy female participants homozygous for either C (n= 11) or G (n= 6) alleles aged 18 – 27 years were tested on four nonconsecutive nights. Participants were given galantamine (an anti-acetylcholinesterase), buspirone (a serotonergic agonist), both drugs together, or placebos before sleeping. Results: As reported previously, buspirone significantly increased rapid eye movement (REM) latency (P< 0. 001), as well as awakenings, percentage of time spent awake, and percentage of time <b>asleep</b> spent <b>in</b> stage N 1 (P< 0. 019). Galantamine increased awakenings, percentage of time spent awake, percentage of time <b>asleep</b> spent <b>in</b> stage N 1, and percentage of time <b>asleep</b> spent <b>in</b> REM, and decreased REM latency and percentage of time <b>asleep</b> spent <b>in</b> stage N 3 (P< 0. 019). Galantamine plus buspirone given together disrupted sleep more than either drug alone, lowering sleep efficiency and percentage of time <b>asleep</b> spent <b>in</b> stage N 3 and increasing awakenings, percentage of time spent awake, and percentage of time <b>asleep</b> spent <b>in</b> stage N 1 (P< 0. 019). There was no main effect of genotype nor was there a significant multivariate interaction between genotype and drug condition. Conclusion: These findings are partially consistent with the literature about sleep in depression, notably short REM latency, higher percentage of total sleep time spent in REM, lower percentage of time <b>asleep</b> spent <b>in</b> stage N 3, and increased sleep fragmentation. The C/G mutation in the serotonin- 1 A receptor promoter region does not appear to cause noticeable differences in the sleep patterns of a relatively small sample of healthy young females. Future studies with larger sample sizes are required. Keywords: depression, sleep, serotonin, acetylcholine, buspirone, galantamin...|$|R
5|$|Cloud, a single-player {{video game}} for Microsoft Windows, {{centers on a}} boy who dreams of flying through the sky while <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> a {{hospital}} bed. The player assumes control of the sleeping boy's avatar—the projection of the boy into his dream world—and guides him through his dream {{of a small group}} of islands with a light gathering of clouds. The avatar's direction and speed are controlled with a mouse; movement is generally on a horizontal plane, but vertical flight can be attained by holding down the third button of the mouse. The player may interact with clouds only while flying horizontally.|$|E
5|$|Editors' own {{variation}} of dark indie guitar rock draws on influences from both older and contemporary bands. Their influences include Echo & the Bunnymen, Joy Division, The Strokes, The Walkmen, Elbow. and R.E.M.. The band draw their musical style {{particularly from the}} latter two bands' debut albums <b>Asleep</b> <b>in</b> the Back and Murmur. While often compared to Joy Division and Echo and the Bunnymen by the media, the band commented that those bands are too old {{to have a major}} impact on their musical style. Upon Editors' first appearances in the British music scene, they were also heavily compared to American indie band Interpol.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} English {{translation}} of 1847 by Mary Howitt, the tale {{opens with a}} beggar woman giving a peasant's wife a barleycorn in exchange for food. Once planted, a tiny girl, Thumbelina (Tommelise), emerges from its flower. One night, Thumbelina, <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> her walnut-shell cradle, is carried off by a toad who wants her as a bride for her son. With the help of friendly fish and a butterfly, Thumbelina escapes the toad and her son, and drifts on a lily pad until captured by a stag beetle who later discards her when his friends reject her company.|$|E

He prepares to kill her, but Oskar, who was hiding inside the apartment, interferes; Eli immediately wakes up, jumps on Lacke and kills him, feeding on his blood. Eli thanks Oskar and kisses him in gratitude. However, an upstairs neighbor is angrily knocking on the ceiling due to the disturbance the fight has caused. Eli realizes {{that it is no}} longer safe to stay and leaves the same night.|$|E
5|$|The {{children}} {{spent the}} morning in the resort's Kids' Club, then the family lunched at their apartment before heading to the pool. Kate took the last known photograph of Madeleine at 2:29 that afternoon, sitting by the pool next to her father and two-year-old sister. The children returned to Kids' Club, and at 18:00 their mother took them back to 5A, while their father went for a tennis lesson. The McCanns put the children to bed around 19:00. Madeleine was left <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> short-sleeved, pink-and-white Marks and Spencer's Eeyore pyjamas, next to her comfort blanket and a soft toy, Cuddle Cat.|$|E
5|$|The game {{centers on}} a boy who dreams of flying while <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> a {{hospital}} bed. The concept was partially based on lead designer Jenova Chen's childhood; he was often hospitalized for asthma and would daydream while alone in his room. Assuming {{the role of the}} boy, the player flies through a dream world and manipulates clouds to solve puzzles. The game was intended to spark emotions in the player that the video game industry usually ignored.|$|E

5|$|During Barry's career, he was {{credited}} with saving the lives of more than forty people, although this number has sometimes varied over the years. Barry's most famous rescue {{was that of a}} young boy. He found the child <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> a cavern of ice. After warming up the boy's body sufficiently by licking him, he moved the boy about and onto his back and carried the child back to the hospice. The child survived and was returned to his parents, although other sources say that the boy's mother died in the avalanche that trapped the boy. The Museum of Natural History in Bern disputes the legend, attributing it to Peter Scheitlin, an animal psychologist.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, the Disneys {{moved to}} Kansas City, Missouri. There, Disney {{attended}} the Benton Grammar School, {{where he met}} fellow-student Walter Pfeiffer, who came {{from a family of}} theatre fans and introduced Disney to the world of vaudeville and motion pictures. Before long, he was spending more time at the Pfeiffers' house than at home. Elias had purchased a newspaper delivery route for The Kansas City Star and Kansas City Times. Disney and his brother Roy woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver the Times before school and repeated the round for the evening Star after school. The schedule was exhausting, and Disney often received poor grades after falling <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> class, but he continued his paper route for more than six years. He attended Saturday courses at the Kansas City Art Institute and also took a correspondence course in cartooning.|$|E
