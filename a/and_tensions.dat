5|$|He died {{without a}} {{legitimate}} male heir and was succeeded to the Polish throne by his half-brother, John II Casimir Vasa (Jan Kazimierz Waza). Władysław's death {{marked the end}} of relative stability in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, as conflicts <b>and</b> <b>tensions</b> that had been growing over several decades came to a head with devastating consequences, notably the largest of the Cossack uprisings – the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648) – and the Swedish invasion ("the Deluge", 1655–60).|$|E
5|$|In {{the view}} of the {{production}} team, Peggy's breast cancer was a catalyst, creating new dynamics <b>and</b> <b>tensions</b> amongst existing characters. Realism was also an issue. As a middle-aged woman, Peggy was epidemiologically at higher risk for developing breast cancer. In 2001, it was reported that Peggy's character was one of only a few media portrayals of older females to be given the disease, and source organisations have praised EastEnders for this.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the relationships between}} membrane potential, intracellular [Ca 2 +] ([Ca 2 +]i), <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> in muscles of the canine gastric fundus in response to nitrergic stimulation by NO donors and electrical field stimulation (EFS) of intrinsic enteric inhibitory neurons when adrenergic and cholinergic responses were blocked. NO donors reduced [Ca 2 +]i <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> in a concentration-dependent manner. A close relationship was noted between these parameters. In terms of the [Ca 2 +]vs. force relationship, relaxation responses to EFS differed from responses to NO donors. EFS resulted in smaller decreases in [Ca 2 +]i to produce a given relaxation compared with responses to NO donors. Thus, muscles stimulated with EFS were less sensitive to [Ca 2 +]i than muscles stimulated with exogenous NO. When membrane potential, [Ca 2 +]i <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> were monitored simultaneously in the same muscles, a temporal dissociation was noted between the electrical responses and changes in [Ca 2 +]i <b>and</b> <b>tension.</b> Brief electrical responses were associated with more sustained changes in [Ca 2 +]i <b>and</b> <b>tension.</b> Further dissociation between electrical and mechanical effects was noted. Changes in [Ca 2 +]i <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> caused by sodium nitroprusside and EFS were blocked by arginine analogues and by oxyhaemoglobin, but electrical responses were unaffected. 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3 -a]quinoxalin- 1 -one (ODQ), an inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase, also blocked the effects of nitrergic stimulation on [Ca 2 +]i <b>and</b> <b>tension,</b> without affecting hyperpolarization. Thus, {{in the presence of}} continued hyperpolarization, the reductions in [Ca 2 +]i <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> caused by nitrergic stimulation were blocked. Block of hyperpolarization in response to nitrergic stimulation with tetrapentylammonium chloride (TPEA) had relatively little effect on the [Ca 2 +]i <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> responses. Thus, hyperpolarization is not required for nitrergic effects on [Ca 2 +]i <b>and</b> <b>tension.</b> In summary, reduction in [Ca 2 +]i <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> in response to nitrergic stimulation of the canine gastric fundus does not depend upon electrical hyperpolarization. Non-electrical mechanisms such as enhanced uptake of Ca 2 + by the sarcoplasmic reticulum or reduction in the Ca 2 + sensitivity of the contractile apparatus may be the primary mechanisms mediating nitrergic responses in these muscles...|$|R
40|$|Background: Headache {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{complaints}} of the patients referring to the treatment centers. Also, some studies have reported the correlation of sleep disturbances with migraine <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> headaches. This study was aimed to analyze the association of sleep disturbances with migraine <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> headaches. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 1005 students of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences were selected by stratified random sampling during the academic year 2013 - 2014. Having attracted the participation and cooperation of the participants, sleep disorder and symptoms of headache (migraine <b>and</b> <b>tension)</b> tests were administered.

5|$|The novel's {{central theme}} {{involves}} {{the examination of}} the human desire to detect patterns or meaning and the risks of finding patterns in meaningless data. Other themes include methods of interpretation of history, cultural familiarity with brand names, <b>and</b> <b>tensions</b> between art and commercialization. The September 11, 2001 attacks are used as a motif representing the transition to the new century. Critics identify influences in Pattern Recognition from Thomas Pynchon's postmodern detective story The Crying of Lot 49.|$|E

30|$|The highest {{crushing}} strength <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> strength are no surprisingly resided in longitudinal direction, while the lowest {{crushing strength}} <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> strength {{are found in}} TR 45 ° direction and tangential direction, respectively. The longitudinal–radial plane has crushing strengths <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> strengths both higher than that in the corresponding directions in longitudinal–tangential plane, {{probably due to the}} reinforcement of ray cells aligned in the radial direction [20]. The maximum coefficient of variation for both crushing strength <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> strength are with specimens in TR 45 ° direction. This is probably due to the curvature of annual rings in this kind of specimen which increases the uncertainty of the direction in which the forces act. Although this error has been tried to avoid in preparation of specimens, yet it seems it has not been fully removed.|$|R
5|$|To {{assist the}} actors in {{preparing}} for their roles, Scott wrote several pages of backstory for each character explaining their histories.

5|$|After France surrendered, Marcinkus {{managed to}} make his way to the French colonies in Africa (Morocco and Algeria).

On 12 August 1940 he was finally demobilized from the French army. Marcinkus and some of his associates concocted a daring plan to commandeer several aircraft without authorization and fly to England. The plan was not executed due to increased security at airfields and other circumstances. He finally received the necessary documents enabling him to go to Britain in autumn of 1940.|$|E

5|$|In 1185 John {{made his}} first visit to Ireland, {{accompanied}} by 300 knights and a team of administrators. Henry had tried to have John officially proclaimed King of Ireland, but Pope Lucius III would not agree. John's first period of rule in Ireland was not a success. Ireland had only recently been conquered by Anglo-Norman forces, <b>and</b> <b>tensions</b> were still rife between Henry II, the new settlers and the existing inhabitants. John infamously offended the local Irish rulers by making fun of their unfashionable long beards, failed to make allies amongst the Anglo-Norman settlers, began to lose ground militarily against the Irish and finally returned to England later in the year, blaming the viceroy, Hugh de Lacy, for the fiasco.|$|E

Brown also frequently clashed with the legislature and vetoed several of the bills it passed; none of his vetoes were ever overridden.|$|E
5|$|Franz Ferdinand and Sophie gave {{up their}} planned program in favor of visiting the wounded from the bombing, at the hospital. Count Harrach took up a {{protective}} position on the left-hand running board of Franz Ferdinand's car. This is confirmed by photographs of the scene outside the Town Hall. At 10:45a.m., Franz Ferdinand and Sophie {{got back into the}} motorcade, once again in the third car. In order to avoid the city center, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, the driver, Leopold Lojka, took a right turn into Franz Josef Street. The {{reason for this is that}} Potiorek's aide Eric(h) von Merrizzi was in the hospital, and was therefore unable to give Lojka the information about the change in plans and the driving route. The Sarajevo Chief of Police Edmund Gerde (who had earlier repeatedly protested about the lack of security precautions for the visit) was asked to tell the drivers of the new route but in the confusion <b>and</b> <b>tensions</b> of the moment neglected to do so.|$|E
5|$|In {{a return}} match on 19 January, Yorkshire fielded a {{stronger}} side {{than in the}} first match and inflicted one of the Natives' heaviest losses, a 16–4 defeat. The team then went undefeated until 16 February, when they faced England. Officials of the strictly amateur Rugby Football Union (RFU) had become increasingly concerned at the behaviour of the New Zealanders, regarding them as unsportsmanlike, <b>and</b> <b>tensions</b> reached a nadir {{in the aftermath of}} the England international, during which the RFU secretary George Rowland Hill, refereeing the game, awarded a number of controversial tries to England, prompting three of the Natives to temporarily leave the field in protest; England eventually won 7–0. The Natives apologised afterwards for their behaviour, but the damage was not repaired. The New Zealanders left England without an official send-off, and travelled to Australia where they toured Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. They then returned to New Zealand, where they displayed a level of combination not seen in their home country before. They went 31 games undefeated before losing their final match, on 24 August 1889, 7–2 to Auckland.|$|E
