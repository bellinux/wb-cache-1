25|$|Continuity of supply. The 2015 Impact Report reports an <b>average</b> <b>supply</b> of 18 {{hours per}} day, up from 14 hours in 2006-07. Only in nine mostly small WSPs water is {{provided}} continuously 24 hours per day. In Nairobi water is provided on average for 18 {{hours a day}} and in Mombasa for 6 hours. Nonetheless, instances of water scarcity (defined as more than five days without or with insufficient water supply) still occur in Kenya. In 2006 in Kisumu over 40% of households (both poor and non-poor) connected to water mains reported scarcity. The greatest difference between the poor and non-poor was recorded in Nairobi, where poor households were {{more than twice as likely}} to say they experienced scarcity. A higher percentage of kiosk users reported scarcity than households with mains connections, suggesting that in times of scarcity kiosks are less likely to receive water than domestic connections.|$|E

The level on non-revenue water decreased from an estimated 36% in 2005 to 10% in 2009; one quarter of residents received continuous water supply (although the <b>average</b> <b>supply</b> remained at only 7hours per day) in 2009; the share of metered connections increased from 2% in 2007 to 26% in 2009; the number of customers increased; and the company recovered its operating costs plus a portion of capital costs. Identifying and legalising illegal connections was {{an important element in}} the reduction of non-revenue water. The utility prides itself today of the good drinking water quality provided and encourages its customers to drink from the tap. The utility also operates a wastewater treatment plant that meets discharge standards. The private utility pays salaries that are higher than civil service salaries and conducts extensive training programs for its staff. It has also installed a modern system to track and resolve customer complaints. Furthermore, it conducts independent annual customer satisfaction surveys. JUSCO’s vision is to be the preferred provider of water supply and other urban services throughout India. Together with Ranhill Malaysia it won a 25-year concession contract for providing the water supply in Haldia City, West Bengal.|$|E

Inventory is basic needs aspect to keep the production running smoothly. Inventory management {{is defined as a}} method to organize supplies—such as raw material inventory, working-in-process inventory, or finished goods inventory—for supporting production process. The main job of a hospital is to nurture patients. The maximum service of looking after patients could not be done without the adequate supplies of medicines. Therefore, it is crystal clear that hospital service is work-related with the role of pharmacy. The performance of supply system in Ananda Purwokerto Hospital now is good enough, with the value of safety stocks for goods A, B, and C respectively are 361 items, 21 items, and 8 items.

We also propose an intuitive representation, namely the plot, which allows forensic scientists to explain the average information given by the evidence analysis process in a clear and intuitive way. Such representation allows the forensic scientist to assess the evidence evaluation process with independence of the prior information, which is province of the court. Then, fact finders may check the average information given by the evidence analysis with the incorporation of prior information.
