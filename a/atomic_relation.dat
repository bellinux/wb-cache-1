40|$|This paper {{shows the}} effect of the Oxygen/Carbon <b>atomic</b> <b>relation</b> (O/C) in carbon on {{combustion}} reactivity using the char of three bituminous carbons. Chars were obtained at heating speeds of 104 K/s, temperatures of 900, 1000 and 1100 °C, and at thre eresidence times (100, 150 and 300 ms). Maximum combustion reactivity was determined through isothermal thermogravimetric analysis. Results show that the maximum reactivity of chars increases with the reduction of residence time and devolatilization temperature. There is a linear relation between the char’s maximum reactivity and the O/C <b>atomic</b> <b>relation</b> of the precursor carbon, which indicates that the increase in the amount of oxygen contained in the precursor carbon of the chars generates a significan tincrease in the reactivity of the chars...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the integration of}} existing cone-shaped and projection-based calculi of cardinal direction relations, well-known in QSR. The more general, integrating language we consider is based on convex constraints of the qualitative form r(x,y), r being a cone-shaped or projection-based cardinal direction <b>atomic</b> <b>relation,</b> or of the quantitative form (α,β) (x,y), with α,β∈ [0, 2 π) and (β -α) ∈ [0,π]: {{the meaning of the}} quantitative constraint, in particular, is that point x belongs to the (convex) cone-shaped area rooted at y, and bounded by angles α and β. The general form of a constraint is a disjunction of the form [r_ 1 ∨ [...] . ∨ r_n_ 1 ∨ (α_ 1,β_ 1) ∨ [...] . ∨ (α _n_ 2,β_n_ 2) ](x,y), with r_i(x,y), i= 1 [...] . n_ 1, and (α _i,β_i) (x,y), i= 1 [...] . n_ 2, being convex constraints as described above: the meaning of such a general constraint is that, for some i= 1 [...] . n_ 1, r_i(x,y) holds, or, for some i= 1 [...] . n_ 2, (α_i,β_i) (x,y) holds. A conjunction of such general constraints is a -like CSP, which we will refer to as an (Spatial Constraint Satisfaction Problem). An effective solution search algorithm for an will be described, which uses (1) constraint propagation, based on a composition operation to be defined, as the filtering method during the search, and (2) the Simplex algorithm, guaranteeing completeness, at the leaves of the search tree.

We apply this method for two different automatic structures which have elementary decision procedures, Presburger Arithmetic and automatic structures of bounded degree.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{integrate}} the ideas of flexibility and uncertainty into Allen's interval-based temporal framework, defining a new formalism, called IAfuz, which extends classical Interval Algebra (IA), in order to express qualitative fuzzy constraints between intervals. We generalize the classical operations between IA-relations to IAfuz-relations, {{as well as the}} concepts of minimality and local consistency, referring to the framework of Fuzzy Constraint Satisfaction Problem. We analyze the most interesting reasoning tasks in our framework, which generalize the classical problems of checking consistency, finding a solution and computing the minimal network in the context of IA. In order to solve these tasks, we devise two constraint propagation algorithms and a Branch & Bound algorithm. Since these tasks are NP-difficult, we address the problem of finding tractable sub-algebras of IAfuz, by extending to our fuzzy framework the classical pointizable sub-algebras SAc and SA, as well as the maximal tractable subalgebra H introduced by Nebel. In particular, we prove that the fuzzy extension of the latter, called Hfuz, shares with its classical counterpart a maximality property, in that it is the unique maximal subalgebra of IAfuz which contains the fuzzy extensions of Allen's <b>atomic</b> <b>relations...</b>|$|R
