5|$|Among Scott's first acts <b>as</b> <b>governor</b> was {{appointing}} Jesse Bledsoe as Secretary of State. Bledsoe delivered Scott's first {{address to}} the legislature on December 13, 1808.

His physical condition continued to worsen throughout his term <b>as</b> <b>governor.</b>|$|E

Eliza Violet Gist married Francis Preston Blair on July 21, 1812, just prior to the expiration of Scott's term <b>as</b> <b>governor.</b> The governor opined that Blair, who was slightly built, stoop-shouldered, and suffering from tuberculosis, would leave Eliza a widow within six months.

He also achieved advancements in education, including some progress toward desegregation. In 1950, Clements {{was elected to the}} U.S. Senate. He resigned <b>as</b> <b>governor</b> to accept his Senate seat. While in the Senate, he served as Democratic party whip under party leader Lyndon Johnson and {{as executive director of the}} Senate Democratic Reelection Committee from 1957 to 1959. He was defeated by Thruston Morton in his re-election bid in 1956; a lack of support from Chandler (then serving his second term <b>as</b> <b>governor)</b> contributed to Clements' defeat.

In 1995, he published his memoir entitled You Can't Do That, Governor!; a major theme of the book was his disdain for conventional wisdom and political norms. In 1999, he launched ECampus.com, an Internet book retailer.
