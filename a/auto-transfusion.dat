50|$|Initial {{management}} {{consists of}} immediate blood transfusion {{if the patient}} is in hemorrhagic shock. Classically, hemoperitoneum was an indication for emergency surgery to locate the source of bleeding and also to recover spilled blood from the peritoneal cavity and {{to use it for}} <b>auto-transfusion</b> if it has not been contaminated by ruptured bowel contents. The method of control depends on the source of blood loss. Vascular bleeding, i.e. from a blood vessel, would be treated by clamping and ligation of the offending vessel, or repair of the vessel in the case of major arteries such as the aorta or mesenteric arteries. Bleeding from the spleen most often requires splenectomy, or removal of the spleen, usually but not always {{in the form of a}} total splenectomy. Bleeding from the liver might be controlled by application of hemostatic sponges, thrombin, or more recently, argon beam cauterization.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{regulation}} of red blood cell production has been greatly enhanced by the cloning and expression of the gene for human erythropoietin (Epo) and its receptor. The availability of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) for administration to patients has ushered {{in a new era}} in molecular medicine. Intravenous or subcutaneous administration of rhEpo can reliably cure the anemia of chronic renal failure and may be effective in the treatment of anemias secondary to chronic inflammation, malignancy, and marrow suppression from chemotherapy. In addition, rhEpo therapy will probably play a prominent role in transfusion medicine, both in preparing patients for <b>auto-transfusions</b> as well as in minimizing red cell transfusion requirements in the post-operative period. One of the most dramatic successes in the application of modern molecular biology to medicine has been the cloning of the erythropoietin (Epo) gene [1, 2] and the high-level expression of recombinant human Epo (rhEpo), enabling its administration to patients. In this brief review, I will first discuss erythropoiesis, in vitro and in vivo, and its regulation by Epo. This background information is highly relevant to the development of rhEpo for effective treatment of various anemias as well as to othe...|$|R

40|$|Intra-operative, peri-articular {{injection}} of local anaesthesia is an increasingly popular way of controlling pain following total knee replacement. At the same time, {{the problems associated}} with allogenic blood transfusion have led to interest in alternative methods for managing blood loss after total knee replacement, including the use of <b>auto-transfusion</b> of fluid from the patient’s surgical drain. It is safe to combine peri-articular infiltration with <b>auto-transfusion</b> from the drain. We performed a randomised clinical trial to compare the concentration of local anaesthetic in the blood and in the fluid collected in the knee drain in patients having either a peri-articular injection or a femoral nerve block. Clinically relevant concentrations of local anaesthetic were found in the fluid from the drains of patients having peri-articular injections (4. 92 μg/ml (SD 3. 151)). However, none of the patients having femoral nerve blockade had detectable levels. None of the patients in either group had clinically relevant concentrations of local anaesthetic in their blood after re-transfusion.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{undergoing}} total knee replacement (TKR) in the UK {{usually have}} either blood cross-matched or have an <b>auto-transfusion</b> of drained blood postoperatively. A previous retrospective audit of blood requirements {{in patients who}} had undergone primary TKR showed that {{a large amount of}} cross-matched blood was wasted as the CT ratio (ratio of number of units of blood cross-matched to number of units transfused) of 4. 9 : 1 was obtained. The range recommended by the Blood Transfusion Society is 2 : 1 to 3 : 1. METHODS: A protocol was introduced to group and save plus antibody screen for all patients and to cross-match 2 units of blood pre-operatively in patients with either a haemoglobin of less than 12. 5 g/dl or with multiple red cell antibodies in their blood. The trigger point for blood transfusion postoperatively was also reduced from 9. 0 g/dl to 8. 0 g/dl, unless the patient was clinically symptomatic. RESULTS: A further prospective study involving 50 patients was carried out using the new protocol. Five patients required cross-matching pre-operatively, three with haemoglobin less than 12. 5 g/dl and two with multiple red cell antibodies. Postoperatively, the patients with haemoglobin of less than 12. 5 g/dl required blood transfusion of 2 units each, reducing the CT ratio to 1. 7 : 1. The patients with red cell antibodies did not require a blood transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits from above protocol are 2 -fold: patient safety, as risks of transfusion are avoided; and cost saving, in regards to haematology technician time and <b>auto-transfusion</b> sets which cost around pound 70 each...|$|E
40|$|Leukocyte {{filtration}} of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) perfusate after {{cardiac surgery}} has evolved {{as an important}} technique to prevent effector functions mediated by activated leukocytes. However, {{little is known about}} the filtration efficiency. Therefore, an in vitro study was conducted to define the leukocyte removal rate of a transfusion leukocyte-depletion filter, using cell-washed and unwashed whole porcine blood. In addition, the influence of different cell-washing protocols on the elimination rate of blood cells (leukocytes and platelets) was investigated. Fresh, diluted, pooled, heparinized, porcine blood was processed using either a high-flow (HF, n = 5) or quality-wash (QW, n = 5) protocol on a continuous <b>auto-transfusion</b> system, or was left unprocessed (control n= 5). Thereafter, all samples were filtered using a transfusion leukocyte-depletion filter. Blood samples for measurement of hematocrit, white blood cell count, including leukocyte differentiation and platelet count, were taken before and after filtration. To compare the experimental groups, the removal rate was presented as the fraction of leukocytes or platelets removed per plasma volume. Cell washing significantly altered the fraction of leukocytes removed per plasma volume when compared to unprocessed blood (2. 07 and 2. 36 in the HF and QW groups, respectively, versus 1. 34 in the control group, p = 0. 008 for both). No statistically significant difference in leukocyte removal rate was observed between the different cell-washing protocols. The leukocyte differential count showed that, during all experiments, the neutrophils were removed most efficiently (99. 7 %). Overall, significantly more platelets were depleted after cell washing compared to the control group (1. 47 and 1. 60 in the HF and QW groups, respectively, versus 1. 12 in the control group, p = 0. 008 and 0. 032, respectively). Furthermore, the amount of blood that could be filtered using a single pass technique did not significantly differ between the experimental groups. However, a larger variation in the total amount of filtered blood was observed in the unprocessed group (570 +/- 398 mL) compared to the cell-washed groups (360 +/- 42 and 430 +/- 97 mL in the HF and QW groups, respectively). In conclusion, blood processing with an <b>auto-transfusion</b> system significantly enhances the leukocyte and platelet removal efficiency of the transfusion leukocyte-depletion filter that was studied. In particular, neutrophils were efficiently removed...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Total hip or knee {{arthroplasty}} is {{an elective}} procedure {{that is usually}} accompanied by substantial blood loss, which may lead to acute anemia. As a result, almost half of total joint arthroplasty patients receive allogeneic blood transfusions (ABT). Many {{studies have shown that}} post-operative <b>auto-transfusion</b> (PAT) significantly reduces the need for ABT, but other studies have questioned the efficacy of this method. METHODS: The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see Checklist S 1. To evaluate the efficacy of PAT, we conducted a Cochrane systematic review that combined all available data from randomized controlled trials. Data from the six included trials were pooled for analysis. We then calculated relative risks with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences with 95 % CIs for continuous outcomes. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to compare the clinical results between PAT and a control in joint replacement patients. This meta-analysis has proven that the use of a PAT reinfusion system reduced significantly the demand for ABT, the number of patients who require ABT and the cost of hospitalization after total knee and hip arthroplasty. This study, together with other previously published data, suggests that PAT drains are beneficial. Larger, sufficiently powered studies are necessary to evaluate the presumed reduction in the incidence of infection as well as DVT after joint arthroplasty with the use of PAT...|$|E

The true incidence is not known since many patients succumb shortly after injury. The high fatality is due to difficulty in diagnosis, technical prob-lems with repair and consequences of SVC clamping. Literature review revealed no shrap-nel SVC injury reported before. This is a report of 30 -year-old man from Kirkuk, Iraq, a victim of terroristic attack who was admitted to Sulaima-nia Teaching Hospital (STH) on June 2007 with shock, massive right-side haemothorax and a wound at base of neck following a shrapnel in-jury. Emergency right thoracotomy revealed clotted haemothorax and big shrapnel partly sealing a tear in SVC just above the entrance of the azygos vein. Severe bleeding ensued after extraction of the shrapnel. Attempts to control the hemorrhage and repair of the injury failed and unfortunately, the patient expired in the theatre. Though there is no pathognomonic sign of SVC injury, it should be suspected in patients presenting with shock and haemothorax. Suc-cessful repair is achievable with early diagnosis, aggressive resuscitation, early exploration, op-timum operating conditions and special meas-ures such as <b>auto-transfusion</b> and cardiopul-monary bypass...|$|E
40|$|Background: In Graves' disease, {{because a}} thyroid tends to have extreme vascularity, {{the amount of}} {{intraoperative}} blood loss (AIOBL) becomes significant in some cases. We sought to elucidate the predictive factors of the AIOBL. Methods: A total of 197 patients underwent thyroidectomy for G raves' disease between 2002 and 2012. We evaluated clinical factors that would be potentially related to AIOBL retrospectively. Results: The median period between disease onset and surgery was 16 months (range: 1 - 480 months). Conventional surgery was performed in 125 patients, whereas video-assisted surgery was performed in 72 patients. Subtotal and near-total/total thyroidectomies were performed in 137 patients and 60 patients, respectively. The median weight of the thyroid was 45 g (range: 7. 3 - 480. 0 g). Univariate analysis revealed that the strongest correlation of AIOBL was noted {{with the weight of}} thyroid (p < 0. 001). Additionally, AIOBL was correlated positively with the period between disease onset and surgery (p < 0. 001) and negatively with preoperative free T 4 (p < 0. 01). Multivariate analysis showed that only the weight of the thyroid was independently correlated with AIOBL (p < 0. 001). Four patients (2. 0 %) needed blood transfusion, including two requiring <b>auto-transfusion,</b> whose thyroids were all weighing in excess of 200 g. The amount of drainage during the initial 6 hours and days until drain removal was correlated positively with AIOBL (p < 0. 001, each). Occurrences of postoperative complications, such as recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy or hypoparathyroidism, and postoperative hospital stay were not correlated with AIOBL. Conclusion: A huge goiter presented as a predictive factor for excessive bleeding during surgery for Graves' disease, and preparation for blood transfusion should be considered in cases where thyroids weigh more than 200 g...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Intra-operative cell salvage is {{increasingly}} used, especially in longer cases with continuing blood toss. However {{it is unknown}} if the quality of processed blood is affected when larger quantities of blood are processed. We hypothesized {{that the quality of}} the washed blood decreases after multiple runs. Methods: Intra-operative cell salvage was performed in 42 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery. When 1250 ml of blood was collected in the blood collection reservoir, this was processed and returned to the patient. In 21 patients more than 2500 ml of blood was collected during the whole procedure, thus allowing at least two subsequent runs with the <b>auto-transfusion</b> device. Blood samples were drawn from the blood collection reservoir of the cell saver device before, and from the processed blood after each run. Results: After the first run interleukin- 6 concentrations were reduced with 85 % (from 21 +/- 35 Lg/t to 3. 1 +/- 4. 4 mu g/l), whereas after the second run 72 % was removed (63 +/- 69 mu g/l to 17. 6 +/- 25. 3 mu g/l). Leukocyte counts almost doubted after both processing runs (from 2. 6 +/- 1. 5 x 10 (9) /l to 5 +/- 3. 6 x 10 (9) /l) and from 3. 9 +/- 2. 2 x 10 (9) /l to 7. 7 +/- 5. 9 x 10 (9) /l), hemoglobin concentration (14. 8 +/- 1. 6 mmol/l vs 15. 0 +/- 1. 1 mmol/l), free hemoglobin (2. 3 +/- 1. 6 g/l vs 2. 1 +/- 1. 4 g/l) and ptatelet counts (18 +/- 9 x 10 (9) /l vs 28 +/- 23 x 10 (9) /l) were not different between the two runs. Conclusions: Our results suggest, based on interleukin- 6 and free hemoglobin washout that the quality of the processed blood remains constant with multiple runs of the cell saver device.

30|$|As soon as thoracotomy, his {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} fell to 50  mmHg followed by the ventricular fibrillation (VF). The patient’s body temperature was 36.9  °C. Defibrillation (biphasic, 200 J) was immediately delivered, but electrocardiogram (ECG) showed asystole and we started CPR. The patient was firmly fixed in the left lateral position and immediate conversion to the supine position for chest compression was impossible. Direct heart compression seemed infeasible because of firmly adhesive right lung and mediastinum. Extracorporeal CPR seemed also infeasible because of firmly fixed lateral positioning. So chest compression by two surgeons started with the patient in the lateral position (Fig. 1). One surgeon {{stood in front of}} the patient and placed his both palms on patient’s sternum, another surgeon placed his both palms on the patient’s mid-thoracic spine from his back, and chest compression was performed from both sides simultaneously at approximately 100 times per minute. During chest compression, the patient’s arterial pressure waveform appeared sinusoidal in tune with chest compression with systolic value about 35 – 50  mmHg, and diastolic value about 25 – 35  mmHg. EtCO 2 was 5 – 20  mmHg. One-lung ventilation was returned to two-lung ventilation. Pulse check was performed every 2  min during CPR and ECG showed asystole every time, and then chest compression by two practitioners was restarted after intravenous bolus infusion of 1  mg epinephrine. The culprit of bleeding was right main pulmonary artery. We also used an <b>auto-transfusion</b> system so as to conserve blood transfusion. After the anastomosis and hemostasis of culprit right pulmonary artery, the waveforms of ECG changed from asystole to VF, and two times of defibrillation (biphasic, 200 J) were delivered, which was effective. ECG waveform converted to sinus rhythm and the patient’s pulse became palpable, so we stopped CPR. CPR time was 25  min. During the reminder of the procedure the patient was hemodynamically stable under the high dose of inotrope infusion (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine). After the final check of hemostasis the patient’s chest was closed and the operation finished. The overview of resuscitation is shown in the Fig. 2. The patient received 2520  ml of packed red blood cells, 1200  ml of fresh frozen plasma, 200  ml of platelet and 2600  ml of intraoperative blood salvage, in addition to 5350  ml of fluid administration. At the end of surgery, the patient’s body temperature was 35.7  °C. He showed bilateral mydriasis and loss of light reflex.|$|E
