40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the modulating role of ascorbic acid (AA) on rectal temperature (RT), heterophil to lymphocyte (H to L) ratio and <b>aberrant</b> <b>behaviours</b> of ostrich chicks transported by road for 4 h during hot-dry conditions. Twenty ostrich chicks aged 2. 5 months, of both sexes and belonging to the Red Neck breed, served as subjects of the study. The chicks were assigned randomly to AA-treated and control groups, consisting of 10 chicks each. The AA-treated group was administered orally with 100 mg/kg body weight of AA dissolved in 5 mL of sterile water 30 min before transportation, whilst the control group was given the equivalent of sterile water only. The thermal load (TL) experienced in the vehicle during transportation fluctuated between 31 °C and 89 °C, as calculated from the ambient temperature and relative humidity. Transportation induced hyperthermia, lymphopenia, heterophilia and <b>aberrant</b> <b>behaviours</b> of pecking, wing fluffing and panting, which were ameliorated by AA administration. The relationships between the TL, journey duration and physiological variables of RT, H to L ratio and <b>aberrant</b> <b>behaviours</b> recorded during transportation were significantly and positively correlated in the control group. In AA-treated group the relationships were not significantly correlated. In conclusion, the results showed {{for the first time that}} AA ameliorated the adverse effects of stress caused by road transportation on the <b>aberrant</b> <b>behaviours,</b> RT and H to L ratio of ostrich chicks during the hot-dry season...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and Aims: The limited {{literature}} on pain in opioid-treatment samples {{indicates that it}} is highly prevalent. Understanding the implications of pain on treatment outcomes is important, {{particularly in light of}} ageing opioid-treatment cohorts. This study explores correlates of pain, including <b>aberrant</b> <b>behaviours</b> related to prescribed opioids. Our hypothesis is that pain may increase <b>aberrant</b> opioid-related <b>behaviours,</b> including illicit substance use, among opioid-dependent people. Design and Methods: We examined pain in methadone or buprenorphine patients (n[*]=[*] 141) from three treatment services. Measures included basic demographics, Brief Pain Inventory, general mental health, physical health and quality of life measures, pain history and treatments, and an <b>aberrant</b> opioid-related <b>behaviour</b> scale. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine correlates of pain. Results: Forty percent reported current pain, measured with the first question of the Brief Pain Inventory. Correlates of pain were depression ratings [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2. 24, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 04, 4. 83], anxiety ratings (adjusted OR 4. 29, 95 % CI 1. 88, 9. 80) and self-reported health ratings (adjusted OR 0. 35, 95 % CI 0. 16, 0. 76). Contrary to our hypothesis, pain was not associated with greater use of illicit opioids, nor any <b>aberrant</b> opioid-related <b>behaviours.</b> Pain was comparable among methadone and buprenorphine patients. Discussion and Conclusions: The lack of association with pain and <b>aberrant</b> <b>behaviours</b> suggest that it should not be assumed that those in opioid treatment misuse medications in response to pain. The high prevalence of depression/anxiety symptoms indicates a need for further work with larger samples to explore pain and co-morbidity among opioid-dependent people...|$|R

Forty per cent of the crossings included events of <b>aberrant</b> <b>behaviours,</b> such as abrupt course changes, slow travel speeds, interruptions, aborted crossings followed by retreats from the desert and failed crossings due to death, indicating difficulties for the migrants. The mortality during the Sahara crossing was 31 per cent per crossing attempt for juveniles (first autumn migration), compared with only 2 per cent for adults (autumn and spring combined). Mortality associated with the Sahara passage made up a substantial fraction (up to about half for juveniles) of the total annual mortality, demonstrating that this passage has a profound influence on survival and fitness of migrants. <b>Aberrant</b> <b>behaviours</b> resulted in late arrival at the breeding grounds and an increased probability of breeding failure (carry-over effects).

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that unsafe driver acts can be {{classified}} into two distinct categories (i. e., errors and violations) entailing different measures for reducing road traffic accidents, A survey of over 1400 drivers in Greece is reported in which a variety of <b>aberrant</b> driving <b>behaviours</b> have been identified. The present study has confirmed the results of earlier studies in the driving populations of Britain, Australia and Sweden that errors and violations are the major determinants in the factor structure of <b>aberrant</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Three types of violations were identified including, highway code-, aggressive- and parking-violations (or situational violations). Mistakes and lapses were two major forms of errors. The factor analysis identified another two classes of behaviour that could not be accounted for very well by the error-violation distinction. One class of behaviours referred to a state of low preparedness and negligence while the other class referred to communication errors and 'social disregard' for the other road users. Each class of behaviour was found to have different demographic correlates, Finally, accident liability was predicted by self-reported tendency to commit highway-code violations, but not by tendency to make errors due to failures of judgement (i. e., mistakes) or lapses. Aggressive violations were significantly related to involvement in speeding convictions and law-breaking whilst highway-code violations were related to speeding convictions only.

On account of the birds' relatively human-like appearance and behavior, human observers have interpreted this behavior anthropomorphically as sexual deviance. The first to record such behavior was Dr Levick, in 1911 and 1912, but his notes were deemed too indecent for publication at the time; they were rediscovered and published in 2012."The pamphlet, declined for publication with the official Scott expedition reports, commented on the frequency of sexual activity, auto-erotic behaviour, and seemingly <b>aberrant</b> <b>behaviour</b> of young unpaired males and females, including necrophilia, sexual coercion, sexual and physical abuse of chicks and homosexual behaviour," [...] states the analysis written by Douglas Russell and colleagues William Sladen and David Ainley.

40|$|Background: Behavioural and {{psychological}} symptoms of dementia (BPSD) {{are associated with}} considerable burden to patients with dementia and their caregivers. Formal caregivers in residential care settings face different challenges when delivering care. Objective: This study aimed at assessing the clinical correlates of challenging BPSD using the Chinese version of the Challenging Behaviour Scale (CCBS) designed for residential care settings. Methods: One hundred and twenty-five participants were recruited from three care-and-attention homes in Hong Kong. The CCBS was administered together with the Cantonese version of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) to explore the relationships between challenging behaviour and important clinical correlates. Results: The CCBS had good internal consistency (α = 0. 86), inter-rater (ICC = 0. 79) and test-retest reliability (ICC = 0. 98). A four-factor structure is demonstrated by factor analysis: hyperactivity behaviours, hypoactivity behaviours, verbally aggressive and <b>aberrant</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Challenging behaviours were associated with male gender, cognitive impairment, functional disability, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and higher caregiver's workload. Conclusions: The CCBS is a valid and reliable measure to assess BPSD in residential care settings in local Chinese community.
