5|$|An error as to a jurisdictional, or precedent, fact is an {{exception}} to the general rule that the High Court does not judicially review errors of fact. Under the threefold classification of the broad grounds of judicial review set out in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ("the GCHQ case", 1983) – illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety – an error as to <b>a</b> <b>precedent</b> fact may be regarded as a form of illegality.|$|E
5|$|An error as to <b>a</b> <b>precedent</b> fact, if committed, deprives {{the public}} {{authority}} {{of power to}} take the action or make the decision in question. The existence or non-existence of the fact, {{as the case may}} be, is a condition precedent or prerequisite to the exercise of the power. An example of an error of this nature {{can be found in the}} United Kingdom case White & Collins v. Minister of Health (1939). In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could only issue a compulsory purchase order affecting the applicants' land if it was not part of, among other things, a park. A minister confirmed the purchase order but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not exercise power to acquire the land since it was part of a park. Whether the land was or was not a park was <b>a</b> <b>precedent</b> fact, and the minister had committed an error concerning this fact.|$|E
5|$|Delrina also {{produced}} {{a set of}} screensavers, including one {{that resulted in a}} well-publicized lawsuit for copyright and trademark infringement (Berkeley Systems Inc. v. Delrina).

5|$|Loitering munitions {{that are}} capable of making {{autonomous}} attack decisions (man out of the loop) raise moral, ethical, and international humanitarian law concerns because a human being is not involved in making the actual decision to attack and potentially kill humans. Whereas some guided munitions may lock-on after launch or may be sensor fuzed, their flight time is typically limited and a human launches them at an area where enemy activity is strongly suspected. An autonomous loitering munition, on the other hand, may be launched at an area where enemy activity is only probable, and loiter searching autonomously for targets for potentially hours following the initial launch decision. The IAI Harpy and IAI Harop are frequently cited in the relevant literature as they set <b>a</b> <b>precedent</b> for an aerial system (though not necessarily <b>a</b> <b>precedent</b> when comparing to a modern naval mine) in terms of length and quality of autonomous function, in relation to a cruise missile for example.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court granted certiorari in January 1987, and {{the case}} was argued on October 13, 1987.

5|$|This {{adornment}} in Indian Mound Cemetery {{has been}} called the first such public decoration of Confederate burials, but the claim is disputed by other towns in the Southern United States.

5|$|Though {{based on}} a technicality, the Blyew case set <b>a</b> <b>precedent</b> {{in state and federal}} courts that led to the erosion of Congress's Thirteenth Amendment powers. The Supreme Court {{continued}} along this path in the Slaughter-House Cases (1873), which upheld a state-sanctioned monopoly of white butchers. In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Court ignored Thirteenth Amendment dicta from a circuit court decision to exonerate perpetrators of the Colfax massacre and invalidate the Enforcement Act of 1870.|$|E
