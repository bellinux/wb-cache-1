After {{overcoming}} testing obstacles {{and their own}} fears, they reach the Castle in the Air. Princesses Rhyme <b>and</b> <b>Reason</b> welcome Milo and agree to return to Wisdom. Unable to enter the castle, the demons cut it loose, letting it drift away, but Milo realizes Tock can carry them down because time flies. The demons pursue, but the armies of Wisdom repel them.

5|$|Enlightenment {{philosophy}} {{had developed}} Western Europeans’ interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised Ancient Greece, {{the linchpin of}} Antiquity, as it was perceived and taught. The Enlightenment philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature <b>and</b> <b>Reason</b> were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of Classical Athens. The Ancient Greek democracies, and above all Athens, became models to emulate. There they searched for answers to the political and philosophical problems of their time. Works {{such as those of}} Abbé Barthélemy, Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis (1788), served to fix definitively the image that Europe had of the Aegean.|$|E

40|$|How are <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> {{evidence}} interrelated? According to one prevalent view, <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> evidence are equivalent: {{evidence is}} a <b>reason,</b> <b>and</b> a <b>reason</b> is evidence. On another view <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> evidence are conditionally related: {{if there is}} evidence, {{then there is a}} reason. On a different view <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> evidence are disjunctively related: reasons or evidence can be substituted for each other. In this paper, I argue against these common views, and I defend the view that <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> evidence are conjunctively related: evidence <b>and</b> <b>reasons</b> are distinguishable yet inseparable. I argue <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> evidence are distinct because they come apart in certain cases, <b>and</b> I argue <b>reasons</b> <b>and</b> evidence are inseparable because only when properly conjoined are they capable of yielding correct verdicts on important cases in epistemology...|$|R

5|$|Eliot {{started writing}} East Coker in 1939, and {{modelled}} the poem after Burnt Norton {{as a way}} to focus his thoughts. The poem served as a sort of opposite to the popular idea that The Waste Land served as an expression of disillusionment after World War I, though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. The poem focuses on life, death, and continuity between the two. Humans are seen as disorderly and science is viewed as unable to save mankind from its flaws. Instead, science <b>and</b> <b>reason</b> lead mankind to warfare, and humanity needs to become humble in order to escape the cycle of destruction. To be saved, people must recognize Christ as their savior as well as their need for redemption.|$|E
5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation <b>and</b> <b>reason</b> for harming.|$|E
5|$|Grimsby Town midfielder Peter Bore joined on {{an initial}} one-month loan on {{transfer}} deadline day. York drew {{for the fifth}} time in succession with a 1–1 home draw with Mansfield Town, in which Sodje scored after he latched onto Adie Moses' misplaced header. The team's first victory in six matches came in a 2–0 home win over Woking; the goals came from McBreen and a Danny Bunce own goal. A 4–2 defeat away to Kettering Town saw York's unbeaten run come to an end after nine matches, leaving their opponents as the only unbeaten team in the division. Former Accrington Stanley striker David Brown, former Rotherham United defender Tom Hirst and Ipswich Town midfielder Jai Reason joined the club on trial. After impressing in a reserve-team match, Hirst was signed by the club. However, Brown <b>and</b> <b>Reason</b> were not offered contracts.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} research, we {{proposed}} a systematic approach to disentangling the shared and unique variance explained by achievement goals, reasons for goal pursuit, and specific goal-reason combinations (i. e., achievement goal complexes). Four studies using this approach (involving nearly 1, 800 participants) led to 3 basic sets of findings. First, when testing goals <b>and</b> <b>reasons</b> separately, mastery (-approach) goals <b>and</b> autonomous <b>reasons</b> explained variance in beneficial experiential (interest, satisfaction, positive emotion) and self-regulated learning (deep learning, help-seeking, challenging tasks, persistence) outcomes. Second, when testing goals <b>and</b> <b>reasons</b> simultaneously, mastery goals <b>and</b> autonomous <b>reasons</b> explained independent variance {{in most of the}} outcomes, with the predictive strength of each being diminished. Third, when testing goals, <b>reasons,</b> <b>and</b> goal complexes together, the autonomous mastery goal complex explained incremental variance in most of the outcomes, with the predictive strength of both mastery goals <b>and</b> autonomous <b>reasons</b> being diminished. Comparable results were observed for performance (-approach) goals, the autonomous performance goal complex, and performance goal-relevant outcomes. These findings suggest that achievement goals <b>and</b> <b>reasons</b> are both distinct and overlapping constructs, and that neither unilaterally eliminates the influence of the other. Integrating achievement goals <b>and</b> <b>reasons</b> offers the most promising avenue for a full account of competence motivation...|$|R
5|$|Lafontaine had hesitated {{over the}} 24 hours since the {{afternoon}} of 13 May. He spent hours reconnoitring the terrain, sometimes trying to contain <b>and</b> <b>reason</b> with fleeing, routing scores of French infantrymen and artillerymen of the 55th and 71st Infantry Divisions, and travelling around the area to various regimental headquarters, looking for his Corps commander, General Gransard (whom was deliberately reconnoitring the terrain, for some time, at that relative point in time), for an order to attack, and, in the meantime, extemporarily assessing and conferring with some local command personnel. Owing to this Lafontaine also delayed issuing orders to the tactical attack units until 05:00 on 14 May, by which time the Germans had consolidated their bridgehead and the Panzer divisions' combined arms infantry teams were already advancing inland to Bulson. Lafontaine had had a mission plan since 20:00 on 13 May to defeat the Germans and retake the Meuse bridgeheads, but he waited for an order to proceed. Lafontaine's need for an order was contrary to the unit actions of the Germans, who operated the tactically more efficient Auftragstaktik (Mission Command) system. Ultimately, Lafontaine had squandered valuable hours essential for a prompt, perhaps opportune and timely, perhaps potentially decisive counter-attack effort.|$|E
5|$|Mariano Moreno {{was the son}} of poor parents, Manuel Moreno y Argumosa and Ana Maria Valle, he had {{fourteen}} siblings. He {{studied at}} Colegio Grande de San Carlos, but without living in it, as his family could not afford the price. He graduated with an honor diploma. He met influential people within the literary field, who helped him to continue his studies at the University of Chuquisaca, even when his father could not afford the cost. This was the only big university in South America at the time. He studied the books of Montesquieu, Voltaire, Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and other European philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment. He studied English and French languages as well, to understand authors from Britain and France. This allowed him to work as a translator, and he spent several years working with Rousseau's The Social Contract. Moreno was convinced that society could be changed by the power of intelligence <b>and</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|E
5|$|Milo and Tock {{travel to}} Dictionopolis, {{one of two}} capital cities of the divided Kingdom of Wisdom, and home to King Azaz the Unabridged. They meet King Azaz's cabinet {{officials}} and visit the Word Market, wherein are sold the words and letters that empower the world. A fight between the Spelling Bee and the blustering Humbug breaks up the market, and Milo and Tock are arrested by the very short Officer Shrift. In prison, Milo meets the Which (not {{to be confused with}} Witch), also known as Faintly Macabre, long in charge of which words should be used in Wisdom. She tells him how the two rulers, King Azaz and his brother, the Mathemagician, had two adopted younger sisters, Rhyme <b>and</b> <b>Reason,</b> to whom everyone came to settle disputes. All lived in harmony until the rulers disagreed with the princesses' decision that letters (championed by Azaz) and numbers (by the Mathemagician) were equally important. They banished the princesses to the Castle in the Air, and since then, the land has had neither Rhyme nor Reason.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} patterns <b>and</b> <b>reasons</b> for textile-making in women from non-Western culture, Korea, as well as to examine how these patterns <b>and</b> <b>reasons</b> reflected generational differences. Singelis’s (1994) self-construal model was used to study values; Collier’s (2011) survey was used to investigate patterns <b>and</b> <b>reasons</b> for making textile handcrafts. A total of 365 Korean participants completed the survey: 28 % of the participants were young adults (18 - 25 years old), 42 % were middle adults (26 - 45 years old), and 30 % were older adults (46 - 97 years old). The results confirmed significant differences in the self-construals for different generations of Korean women. Older adults had the highest interdependence scores, followed by the middle adults; the young adults had the lowest scores. Significantly different patterns <b>and</b> <b>reasons</b> among the three Korean groups were also consistent with these results. By demonstrating significantly different patterns <b>and</b> <b>reasons</b> for textile-making between three generations in Korean culture, this study offers a unique contribution to the understanding of the resurgence of textile-making today...|$|R

5|$|The poem was {{the first}} of Eliot's that relied on speech, with a narrator who speaks to the {{audience}} directly. Described as a poem of early summer, air, and grace, it begins with a narrator recalling a moment in a garden. The scene provokes a discussion on time and how the present, not the future or past, really matters to individuals. Memories connect the individual to the past, but the past cannot change. The poem then transitions from memory to how life works and the point of existence. In particular, the universe is described as orderly and that consciousness is not found within time even though humanity is bound by time. The scene of the poem moves from a garden to the London underground where technology dominates. Those who cling to technology <b>and</b> <b>reason</b> are unable to understand the universe or the Logos ("the Word", or Christ). The underworld is replaced by a churchyard and a discussion of death. This, in turn, becomes a discussion of timelessness and eternity, which ends the poem.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no record}} of Goya's {{thoughts}} during this period. He completed the series during a period recuperating from illness, possibly lead poisoning, {{when he was in}} considerable mental and physical pain, and withdrew from public life. Witches' Sabbath is believed to be a rather bitter, but silent, protest against the royalists and clergy who had retaken control of Spain after the Peninsular War of 1807–14. Advocates of the Enlightenment had sought to redistribute land to the peasants, to educate women, publish a vernacular Bible and, by replacing superstition with reason, {{put an end to the}} Inquisition. Witch hunting, seen during the Logroño Inquisition, was an appalling regression to liberals such as Goya. As court painter Goya was a part of the established order; surviving evidence indicates he was acquiesced to the wishes of his patrons. Yet numerous paintings and etchings have emerged since, suggesting he had convictions favouring liberalism, enlightenment, <b>and</b> <b>reason.</b> He seems to have kept such beliefs private, only expressing them in his private art; his more sensitive works were not published at the time, probably for fear of reprisal or persecution. In Witches' Sabbath Goya mocks and ridicules the superstition, fear and irrationality of the ignorant placing their faith in ghouls, quack doctors and tyrants.|$|E
