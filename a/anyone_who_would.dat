5|$|In the 1760s, the British Parliament's {{passage of}} the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts, {{combined}} with other frustrations, increased political tension and anger against England in the colonies. Philadelphia residents joined boycotts of British goods. After the Tea Act in 1773, there were threats against <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> store tea and any ships that brought tea up the Delaware. After the Boston Tea Party, a shipment of tea had arrived in December, on the ship the Polly. A committee told the captain to depart without unloading his cargo.|$|E
5|$|In 1451, {{the very}} {{powerful}} Bosnian regional lord Herzeg Stjepan Vukčić Kosača attacked Dubrovnik, and laid siege to the city. He had earlier been made a Ragusan nobleman and, consequently, the Ragusan government now proclaimed him a traitor. A reward of 15,000 ducats, a palace in Dubrovnik worth 2,000 ducats, {{and an annual}} income of 300 ducats was offered to <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> kill him, along {{with the promise of}} hereditary Ragusan nobility which also helped hold this promise to whoever did the deed. Stjepan was so scared by the threat that he finally raised the siege.|$|E
5|$|In the {{documentary}} {{of the film}} titled A World Unseen, Iñárritu has stated that for the main themes of the film he revisits the issues and concerns of intense parental and filial relations, which audiences of his previous films readily recognize as a recurrent theme in his previous work. Regarding the theme of revenge seen throughout The Revenant, Iñárritu has stated that the approach of vengeance seen in the film needs to be significantly tempered by <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> want to see vengeance as either an effective or useful moral to be applied in life. In the end, Iñárritu states, there can only be disappointment and lack of fulfillment for anyone who looks to revenge as providing a higher purpose for living or a life defining purpose.|$|E

5000|$|Principles of self-injury {{are applied}} to more than just one's self. It is {{noteworthy}} that a person may not request or hire an agent to injure themselves: it is forbidden to waive the rule against self-injury or to abet self-injury to one's own body. The Mishnah states: [...] "If a person asks, 'Blind my eye', or 'cut off my hand' or 'break my leg,' <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> does so is liable (for violating injury law) -- even if a person asking to be injured stipulates that <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> does so <b>would</b> be exempt, the one <b>who</b> causes injury <b>would</b> still be liable. Likewise, if a person asks, 'Tear my clothes' or break my pitcher' then <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> does so is liable; however, if a person asking for their property to be damages stipulates that <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> does so <b>would</b> be exempt, then the exemption is valid."

25|$|Around 1848 a {{group of}} volunteers from the Mexican–American War were {{eventually}} discharged and settled in San Francisco. Many of them were from New York City gangs from the Five Points and Bowery districts. About sixty of them organized into a gang called the Hounds, paraded around {{as if they were}} military, and even creating a headquarters named Tammany Hall within a tent on Kearney Street. In 1849, these thugs began to call themselves the Regulators as they harassed Mexicans and those of Spanish origin, and extorted money from local businesses for protection services. <b>Anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> not pay was likely to lose a nose, ear, or suffer greater bodily injury. However, after {{a group of}} 230 men organized into a militia and confronted the Hounds with possible arrest, they quickly fled from San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|When Steve Jobs {{returned}} to Apple in 1997, he stopped all Macintosh clone efforts, which {{shut down the}} Apple Pippin concept. Once Apple stopped all development of the Pippin platform, it affected all parties. Bandai stopped production of all models of Pippin by mid-1997. Katz Media, who was receiving its systems from Bandai, vowed to continue supporting Pippin in a PR notice released June 25, 1997. Katz Media reportedly had some 100,000 units committed because of written agreements with companies spanning twenty countries. The company would eventually file for bankruptcy {{by the end of}} 1998. On February 27, 1998, DayStar Digital purchased all remaining inventory of hardware from Bandai, and sold the inventory to <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> buy them. A former employee of DayStar placed sales of the Pippin through its distribution chain as high as 2,000 systems.|$|E
25|$|According to Assyrian records, Sennacherib {{was assassinated}} in 681 BC, twenty years after the 701 BC {{invasion}} of Judah. A Neo-Babylonian letter corroborates with the biblical account a sentiment from Sennacherib’s sons to assassinate him, an event Assyriologists have reconstructed as historical. The son Ardi-Mulishi, who is mentioned in the letter as killing <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> reveal his conspiracy, successfully murders his father in c. 681 BC, and was most likely the Adrammelech in 2 Kings, though Sharezer is not known elsewhere. Assyriologists posit the murder was motivated because Esarhaddon was chosen as {{heir to the throne}} instead of Ardi-Mulishi, the next eldest son. Assyrian and Hebrew biblical history corroborate that Esarhaddon ultimately did succeed the throne. Other Assyriologists assert that Sennacherib was murdered in revenge for his destruction of Babylon, a city sacred to all Mesopotamians, including the Assyrians.|$|E

50|$|In art, Domninus is {{depicted}} in military attire, and holds the palm of martyrdom. Domninus' cult was popular in Northern Italy.

25|$|Also {{at about}} this time, John C. Bennett {{reported}} that Smith had offered a cash reward to <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> assassinate Boggs, and that Smith had admitted {{to him that}} Rockwell had done the deed. He {{went on to say}} that Rockwell had made a veiled threat against Bennett's life if he publicized the story. Joseph Smith vehemently denied Bennett's account, speculating that Boggs — no longer governor, but campaigning for state senate — was attacked by an election opponent. Mormon writer Monte B. McLaws, in the Missouri Historical Review, supported Smith, averring that while there was no clear finger pointing to anyone, Governor Boggs was running for election against several violent men, all capable of the deed, and that there was no particular reason to suspect Rockwell of the crime. This opinion was not shared by Rockwell's most noted biographer, Harold Schindler. Whatever the case, the following year Rockwell was arrested, tried, and acquitted of the attempted murder (Bushman, p.468), although most of Boggs' contemporaries remained convinced of his guilt.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, he {{said that}} brandishing a weapon was {{sufficient}} to stop an attack 95% of the time. Other researchers criticized his methodology. A study in Public Opinion Quarterly said that his sample size of 1,015 respondents was {{too small for the}} study to be accurate and that the majority of similar studies suggest a value between 70 and 80 percent. According to Lott, Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz's 1994 estimate rises to 92 percent when brandishing and warning shots are added together. Lott said that the lower rates found by others was at least in part due to the different questions that were asked. The other surveys all asked people to recall events over the previous five years, while Lott had only asked people about events that had occurred during just the previous year. Lott used the higher estimate because it accounted for his claim of media bias. The survey questions have also been made available for years to <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> have liked to replicate the survey themselves.|$|E
25|$|Rescue {{operations}} were immediately undertaken after {{it became clear}} that the plane had crashed, although efforts were hampered by the fact that the crash site was around two hours away from the closest location of police forces. Heavy rains in the area also led to the risk of flooding and landslides. Personnel from the Nepalese Army reached the site of the crash on foot, and were responsible for gathering bodies, but due to weather conditions, helicopters were forced to land more than a mile away. Authorities announced a reward of Rs. 50,000 for <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> find equipment that would help authorities discover the cause of the crash. By 2 September, both the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder of the crashed aircraft had been located; both were undamaged and were analysed by investigators in India. The government of Nepal formed a five-member panel to help determine the cause of the crash; the committee was instructed to submit a report on the crash within 65 days.|$|E
50|$|Weeks later, Claudia {{receives}} a DVD with a cryptic message from Jerry, very much alive. He stated that he'd hidden several DVDs in Sonny Corinthos's house, detailing her part in Michael's shooting. It {{was up to}} her to find the DVDs before <b>anyone</b> else <b>who</b> <b>would</b> expose her.
