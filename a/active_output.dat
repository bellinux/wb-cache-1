The proposed low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) strategy {{is based on}} a novel current allocation principle and is implemented for individual DFIG- or PMSG-based wind turbines.

As a result, the reduction in the <b>active</b> power <b>output</b> from the hybrid wind farm can be decreased, which also helps avoid generator over-speed issues and supply active power support for the power grid. In addition, the reactive current upper limits of DFIG- and PMSG-based sub-wind farms are investigated by considering different <b>active</b> power <b>outputs</b> and different grid voltage dip depths, and the feasible regions of the two types of sub-wind farms for meeting the LVRT requirements are further studied.
