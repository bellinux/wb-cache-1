5|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of sharks dates from the Ordovician period, 450–420 million years ago, before land vertebrates existed and before many plants had colonized the continents. Only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks, suspecting that these scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans. The oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago, in the Silurian period. The first sharks looked very different from modern sharks. The majority of modern sharks {{can be traced back to}} around 100 million years ago. Most fossils are of teeth, often in large numbers. Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. The teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate, an <b>apatite.</b> When a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the <b>apatite</b> prisms. Preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments.|$|E

These unique portions of crystallising fluids give valuable information {{about the nature of}} carbonatite and ijolite magmas. CO 2 - rich, aqueous inclusions, which contain substantial amounts of alkalis, predominate in <b>apatites</b> from these carbonatites. The Na+:K+ weight ratio was found to be in the range 2. 4 - 16. 0. Significant amounts of ore metals are also present, as shown by the occurrence of minute, magnetic, crystalline specks within the inclusion fluid. It is concluded that the carbonatitic fluid from which the <b>apatites</b> crystallised, consisted of a highly mobile, CO 2 - rich, aqueous saline fluid. Homogenisation temperatures, which represent the minimum formation temperature of the <b>apatites,</b> ranged from about 200 °C to 485 °C. The mode of homogenisation of one sample, the Uyi carbonatite, indicated that this fluid was supercritical. A higher estimate of the formation temperature (500 - 590 °C) of the <b>apatites</b> from this sample was obtained from the solution temperature of a transient phase (probably Na 2 CO 3) precipitated from the inclusion fluid at high temperatures during heating-runs. Melt inclusions predominate in <b>apatites</b> from the Wasaki ijolites. Carbonate-rich and silicate-rich inclusions are co-genetic in the <b>apatites</b> from some samples. Heating studies have shown that liquid immiscibility between carbonate-rich and silicate melts can occur in ijolitic magmas. Aqueous, CO 2 -rich, saline fluids may also occur in these magmas. Carbonatitic fluids can be derived from ijolitic magmas. The minimum formation temperature of the Wasaki ijolite <b>apatites</b> was in the range 680 °C- 950 °C. Inclusion studies in <b>apatites</b> from the Homa ijolites showed that the <b>apatites</b> crystallised from a highly saline, aqueous fluid.

40|$|The isotopic {{composition}} of <b>apatites</b> from sedimentary phosphorite deposits {{has been used}} previously to reconstruct ancient conditions {{on the surface of}} the earth. However, questions remain as to whether these minerals retain their original {{isotopic composition}} or are modified during burial and lithification. To better understand how <b>apatites</b> in phosphorites form and are diagenetically modified, we present new isotopic measurements of δ^(18) O values and clumped-isotope-based (Δ_(47)) temperatures of carbonate groups in <b>apatites</b> from phosphorites from the past 265 million years. We compare these measurements to previously measured δ^(18) O values of phosphate groups from the same <b>apatites.</b> These results indicate that the isotopic composition of many of the <b>apatites</b> do not record environmental conditions during formation but instead diagenetic conditions. To understand these results, we construct a model that describes the consequences of diagenetic modification of phosphorites as functions of the environmental conditions (i. e., temperature and δ^(18) O values of the fluids) during initial precipitation and subsequent diagenesis. This model captures the basic features of the dataset and indicates that clumped-isotope-based temperatures provide additional quantitative constraints on both the formational environment of the <b>apatites</b> and subsequent diagenetic modification. Importantly, the combination of the model with the data indicates that the δ^(18) O values and clumped-isotope temperatures recorded by phosphorites do not record either formation or diagenetic temperatures, but rather represent an integrated history that includes both the formation and diagenetic modification of the <b>apatites...</b>|$|R

It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium.

5|$|In 1934, Willard Libby {{reported}} that he had found weak beta activity in pure neodymium, which was attributed to a half-life over 1012years. Almost 20 years later, it was claimed that the element occurs in natural neodymium in equilibrium in quantities below 10−20 grams of promethium per one gram of neodymium. However, these observations were disproved by newer investigations, because for all seven naturally occurring neodymium isotopes, any single beta decays (which can produce promethium isotopes) are forbidden by energy conservation. In particular, careful measurements of atomic masses show that the mass difference 150Nd-150Pm is negative (−87keV), which absolutely prevents the single beta decay of 150Nd to 150Pm. In 1965 O. Erämetsä separated out traces of 145Pm from a rare earth concentrate purified from and <b>apatite,</b> resulting in an upper limit of 10−21 for the abundance of promethium in nature; this may have been produced by the natural nuclear fission of uranium, or by cosmic ray spallation of 146Nd.|$|E

5|$|Mycena galopus is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and plays}} an important role in forest ecosystems as a decomposer of leaf litter. It has been estimated in the UK to account for a large portion of the decomposition of the autumn leaf litter in British woodlands. It is able to break down the lignin and cellulose components of leaf litter. Grown in axenic culture in the laboratory, the fungus mycelium has been shown to degrade (in addition to lignin and cellulose) hemicelluloses, protein, soluble carbohydrates, and purified xylan and pectin using enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, cellulases, and catalase. It is particularly adept at breaking down lignin, which is the second most abundant renewable organic compound in the biosphere, after cellulose. Research also suggests that the fungus weathers soil minerals, making them more available to mycorrhizal plants. Phosphorus, an important macronutrient influencing plant growth, typically occurs in primary minerals like <b>apatite,</b> or other organic complexes, and its low solubility often results in low phosphorus availability in soil. The biological activity of M.galopus mycelium can increase the availability of phosphorus and other nutrients, both as a result of soil acidification due to cation uptake and via the release of weathering agents such low molecular mass organic acids. Studies have shown that the fungus is sensitive to low concentrations of sulphite (SO32−), a byproduct of sulphur dioxide pollution, suggesting that this pollution can be toxic to the growth of the fungus (and the subsequent decomposition of leaf litter) at environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E
