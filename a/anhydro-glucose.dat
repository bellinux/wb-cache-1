40|$|In a {{discussion}} on the constitution of cellulose some years ago; Hibbert (l) pointed out that <b>anhydro-glucose,</b> Type I, may possibly be the nucleus which polymerizes to give cellulose. A simple derivative, which, however, should still be capable of a similar polymerization, is indicated in the structure II. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Of recent years, {{following}} the elucidation of the oonstitution {{and structure of}} the more common mono- and di-saccharides, the attention of carbohydrate chemists has been focussed more and more strongly on the higher polysaccharides. For example, among the plant polysaccharides, it has been definitely established that cellulose is a long linear-chain polymer formed from <b>anhydro-glucose</b> units. In the case of inulin and levan, the chain is made up of anhydro-fructose units, while xylan and other pentosans are linear anhydro-pentose polymers...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Freshly {{isolated}} and old stock strains of Streptococcus bovis originating from the rumen will produce dextran at 37 ' in liquid sucrose-containing media. For * good yields {{the presence of}} CO, in some form is necessary. The CO, may be provided as HCOC at the start or during {{the life of the}} culture or by incubation in a CO, atmo-sphere. The dextran has [a]? + 18 ' 7 ' to + 190 " and is similar chemically to the leuco-nostoc dextran save that branching of the a 1 3 6 linked <b>anhydro-glucose</b> chain is rarer. With some strains practically no dextran is formed in H, as gas-phase or in a closed system without HCO; from which air is excluded. Other strains seem to have a limited power of producing dextran under these conditions, possibly because their action is not entirely homofermentative. Tween 80 will partially replace CO, even with the first kind of strain. Highest yields of dextran, up to 80 % of the <b>anhydro-glucose</b> provided, are obtained when the life of the culture is prolonged by repeated neutralization and when additional sucrose is supplied. This is best achieved by the continuous neutralization obtained when solid CaCO, is present in the culture. Dextran production is always accompanied by accumulation of fructose in the cultur...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of temp. and {{water on the}} dissoln. of cellulose in the solvent system LiCl/DMAc was examd. The phase diagrams performed in the system without water showed that higher amts. of cellulose can be dissolved at 5 °, whereas at 25 °, smaller concns. of LiCl in DMAc are sufficient to solubilize some cellulose. Furthermore a relation between the concn. of LiCl and the max. possible water content was established. The anal. showed that the ratio between water and LiCl in the mixt. has to be < 2 : 1; otherwise, complete dissoln. of cellulose cannot be achieved. The relation between LiCl and <b>anhydro-glucose</b> units was examd. as well. The results implied the breakdown of 2 hydrogen bonds during the soln. process because the interaction of 2 LiCl/DMAc complexes with 1 glucose unit was required. The viscosity of the system was investigated also, but no special behavior was obsd...|$|E
40|$|Ionic liquid {{treatment}} {{has been reported}} by several researchers as a possible {{step in the process}} of fractionating lignocellulosic biomass within the biorefinery concept. However, understanding how solvation can be achieved and how the feedstock biopolymers are affected is needed prior to a viable implementation. An effective two component solvent system for the wood components cellulose and xylan has been developed. Furthermore, the solvation of these components in the system consisting of the ionic liquid (IL) 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate (EMIMAc) in a novel combination with the co-solvent 1 -methylimidazole (MIM) is investigated. Focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) particle characterization in combination with microscopic analysis and molecular weight determinations (xylan) shows that cellulose and xylan can be most efficiently solvated using only 3 to 4 % IL (n/n <b>anhydro-glucose</b> units and n/n anhydro-xylose units) and 9 % IL, respectively, while still avoiding any significant polymer degradation. A model for a two-step process of cellulose solvation in the present system is proposed...|$|E
40|$|The term “Hemicellulose” {{is applied}} to the cell-wall {{constituents}} extracted from plant tissues by cold 4 % sodium hydroxide, after preliminary extractions with cold water and 0. 5 % ammonium oxalate to remove pectic substances and water-soluble materials. The originator of the name was Schultze who, in 1891 and succeeding years, isolated there substances from a number of plant materials by extraction with dilute alkali and precipitation with acid. He observed that they were far more susceptible to dilute acid hydrolysis than cellulose, and believed them to be in some way related to cellulose, probably as intermediates in its formation. Although the eludication of the structure of cellulose and the analysis of hemicellulose have shown that there is little foundation for this belief, the name “hemicellulose” still persists. Hemicelluloses are polysaccharides which generally contain uronic acid. One of the few well-authenticated true hexosans that may be removed by alkali from the cell-wall of a higher plant is the mannan of the ivory nut. When dried by alcohol, hemicellulose preparations are obtained as fine, white or cream, amorphous powders; whereas, if dried from water, they form an extremely hard, horny mass, which will redissolve only with difficulty even if finely ground. The hemicelluloses are optically active, and usually more or less strongly laevo-rotatory. The majority of hemicellulose preparations give either no colour or a slightly greenish colour with iodine. The hemicellulose “A” of black-locust and of English oak sap-woods, precipitated by hydrochloric acid, was found to give a strong blue colouration with iodine. Anderson (1940) found that those hemicelluloses which are coloured by iodine solution usually give some d-glucose along with d-xylose in the products of hydrolysis. O’Dwyer suggests that in these hemicelluloses, <b>anhydro-glucose</b> units form a part of the molecule. It is more probable however, that they are derived from starch associated with it...|$|E
