25|$|With {{a design}} team {{consisting}} of Russell Bruce, Kent Ivor and James Charles he patented significant {{improvements to the}} invention of the modern day <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>truck</b> which has {{had a significant impact on}} international commerce through palletised container movements. In particular, Dolphin proposed a design of the lifting carriage of <b>a</b> masted <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>truck</b> which applies <b>a</b> downward thrust to counteract the bending moment produced on the mast by the load on the load support The team also patented a solution to prevent <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>trucks</b> having to keep repositioning to lift loads by designing a horizontally movable slide.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{introduces}} a new perceptual model for Monte Carlo Localization (MCL). In our approach a 3 D laser scanner {{is used to}} observe the ceiling. The MCL matches ceiling structures like beams, columns, air condition and lightning installation against a world model containing line and point features. Thus the localization is not effected by clutter {{or any kind of}} dynamic obstacles on the ground level. Different experiments show that our system can be used to localize robustly in factory buildings and halls. Experimental results include a 5 day run of <b>an</b> autonomous <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>truck</b> on <b>a</b> logistics fair in Hannove...|$|R
50|$|The {{slip sheet}} {{is used as}} a pallet support device in vehicle {{delivery}} and transportation of products. When slip sheets are supported by a pallet board, flat load carrying surface, or <b>a</b> cart or <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>truck,</b> the structural strength of the slip sheet supports the product load's weight. With the slip sheet supported by one of these transportation devices the unit load can easily be transported both internally within a facility and externally between two facility locations.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s the Myriad was shown at a {{computer}} show in South Africa but unfortunately the machine was {{dropped out of the}} transporting aircraft resulting in the chassis being considerably distorted.

50|$|Because {{they carry}} heavy {{motorized}} equipment, the grade of the incline {{has to be}} shallow. The greater the height differential between truck and dock that a dock leveler can compensate for, the longer the leveler itself has to be. Moreover, the grade of the incline must not be {{so great that the}} vehicles cannot climb it. A height differential of between 7 and 8 inches generally requires a 6 ft leveler for an electric palette carrier. A height differential of between 17 and 18 inches generally requires a 12 ft leveler for <b>a</b> petrol-engined <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>truck.</b> Anyway, the lip has to be considered in the length of the leveler, as it is part of it. A telescopic lip (20 or 40 inches) can help to reduce the length of the leveler to 10 feet.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} a novel trajectory planner for flexible material handling with <b>an</b> autonomous <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>truck.</b> Based on <b>a</b> set of predefined waypoints, a continuous-curvature path {{is computed by}} a concatenation of line and polar spline segments. Regarding the nonholonomic constraints of the vehicle, the trajectory {{as well as an}} associated speed profile is generated. As flexible path planning is required for this kind of application, trajectory generation is not only limited to the base points of a single route. From a list of multiple predefined routes the proper set of waypoints is chosen for guiding the vehicle to a desired destination. Furthermore, a graph-based routing algorithm enables the combination of different routes for trajectory generation. Following the description of the trajectory planner for single and multiple paths, experimental results with speeds up to 1. 7 m/s demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.

50|$|The {{machines}} {{form part}} of the material handling equipment industry that, amongst others, also covers fork lift trucks, overhead cranes and pallet jacks.Although ‘electric tug’ {{is perhaps the most}} commonly used term, suppliers and customers regularly use a range of other names that include towing tractors, battery-powered tugs, electric hand trucks, electric tuggers and pedestrian operated tugs.The tugs move loads across a single level. They do not lift the load clear of the ground which is why the load must be on wheels. If the load itself does not have wheels, it would be placed on a wheeled platform often referred to as a trolley, bogie or skate. The tug connects to this wheeled platform just as <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>truck</b> links to a pallet in order to move a load sat on it.In most cases a steel coupling (male) attached to the machine itself connects to a corresponding coupling (female) bolted to the load’s bogie. A second bogie or multiple bogies will each have identical female couplings attached to them so that a single male coupling attached to the machine can move them all without alterations.|$|E

A suspension based on MR uid dampers has been designed and implemented on an actual vehicle, an heuristic control strategy has been developed, which preserves the ltering properties of the passive suspension when the vehicle moves in straight line with a constant velocity and suppresses the large amplitude pitch and roll motion during turns and braking. Field tests have demonstrated a substantial comfort improvement with respect to the passive suspension, during the braking and turning phases, without any noticeable detrimental eects. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a mobile robot based on <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>truck.</b> This system has been tested in a ham industry and permits to integrate the previous transport system of the factory. In this way, the transport and storage can be done using fork lift trucks, mobile robots or both, and all of them controlled by a planning program. The planner obtains information from an automaton about the kind of product that arrives via the production line, and based {{on the state of the}} plant, it decides which robot is going to be used and where it has to transport the load. Localization of the mobile robot in the plant is performed by two infrared sensors and a laser telemeter on board, that is able to give angular and distance measures to beacons located in the plant.

40|$|The Nuclear Security unit (NUSEC) of the Institute for Transuranium Elements (ITU, JRC) was {{entrusted}} by DG ENER {{to design}} and implement equipment {{in order to achieve}} enhanced safeguards of a plutonium dioxide store located on a reprocessing plant in Sellafield (UK). Enhanced safeguards must lead to a win-win situation for all parties involved. In this case the DG ENER inspectorate will optimise inspection presence in the field, and possibly manpower and future financial resources and the operator will have the right to access its stores without the need for inspector presence. To reach this goal, {{while at the same time}} taking into account current budget constraints, NUSEC developed applications that use equipment commonly used in the safety and security fields but so far have not been used in safeguards. For instance, two laser scanners are used to detect entry/exit events into and out of the store and to provide the necessary information to an algorithm in order to categorize objects/people passing the scanners, e. g. <b>a</b> <b>Fork</b> <b>Lift</b> <b>Truck,</b> a trolley used to bring in PuO 2 containers, a system used for the dispatch of cans, people etc. An RFID reader is used to identify equipment duly authorized to access the store. All PuO 2 containers arriving from the production line must be weighed, identified and measured using gamma and neutron detectors before they can be transferred to the store. For this purpose an Unattended Combined Measurement System (UCMS) was designed and manufactured by the JRC in order to do all verification activities using a single instrument. This paper describes the design features of the equipment and its installation with the support of the Sellafield Ltd in the framework of the “PuO 2 store project”. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|E
