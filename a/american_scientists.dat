5|$|In 1999, <b>American</b> <b>scientists</b> at the University of California, Berkeley, {{announced}} that they had succeeded in synthesizing three atoms of 293Og.

5|$|On May 4, 2005 the United States Postal Service {{issued the}} <b>American</b> <b>Scientists</b> {{commemorative}} postage stamp series, a set of four 37-cent self-adhesive stamps in several configurations designed by artist Victor Stabin.

5|$|The first {{decay of}} atoms of {{oganesson}} {{was observed in}} 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, by a joint team of Russian and <b>American</b> <b>scientists.</b> Headed by Russian nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, the team included <b>American</b> <b>scientists</b> of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California. On 9 October 2006, the researchers announced that they had indirectly detected {{a total of three}} (possibly four) nuclei of oganesson-294 (one or two in 2002 and two more in 2005) produced via collisions of californium-249 atoms and calcium-48 ions.|$|E

5|$|After Milrow was conducted, {{there was}} {{continued}} {{pressure on the}} part of environmental groups against going forward with the larger Cannikin test, while the Federation of <b>American</b> <b>Scientists</b> claimed that the warhead being tested was already obsolete. In May 1971, Gravel sent a letter to U.S. Atomic Energy Commission hearings held in Anchorage, in which he said the risk of the test was not worth taking.|$|E
5|$|<b>American</b> <b>scientists</b> {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the {{evidence}} of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, {{that they would have}} expected to find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons, the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to <b>American</b> <b>scientists.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{scientists}} {{proposed the}} name kurchatovium and the <b>American</b> <b>scientists</b> suggested the name rutherfordium {{for the new}} element. In 1992, the IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) assessed the claims of discovery and concluded that both teams provided contemporaneous evidence to the synthesis of element 104 and that credit should be shared between the two groups.|$|E

5|$|After a {{new term}} of {{negotiations}} between the parties, IUPAC decided to allow the name seaborgium for element 106 and changed the name of element 102 to flerovium after Georgy Flerov following the recognition by the 1993 report that the element had been first convincingly synthesized in Dubna. However, this compromise was also rejected by the <b>American</b> <b>scientists</b> and the decision was retracted. The name flerovium was later used for element 114.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{he became}} a {{champion}} of nuclear nonproliferation. He wrote for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, and helped found the Federation of <b>American</b> <b>Scientists</b> and the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies. He {{was one of the}} few ex-communists to remain employed and academically active throughout the 1950s, but his research turned away from nuclear physics towards astrophysics. He published papers on cosmic rays, and a 1958 paper of his is considered to mark the birth of gamma ray astronomy. He was also known for writing popular science books and articles, and appearing in television programs.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Quebec Agreement was signed, Akers had already cabled London with {{instructions}} that Chadwick, Peierls, Oliphant and Francis Simon should leave immediately for North America.

Two weeks would pass before American officials learnt of the contents of the Quebec Agreement. Over the next two years, the Combined Policy Committee met only eight times.|$|E

5|$|In 1945, {{physicist}} and atomic scientist Dr. J.

5|$|In 1974, a few {{atoms of}} {{seaborgium}} were produced in laboratories {{in the former}} Soviet Union and in the United States.

5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{offered the}} United States {{access to its}} {{scientific}} research, and Cockcroft briefed <b>American</b> <b>scientists</b> on British nuclear weapons developments. He discovered that the American S-1 Project (later renamed the Manhattan Project) was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. The two projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project {{that had already been}} penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, many {{claims of}} the {{discovery}} of nobelium were made from laboratories in Sweden, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Although the Swedish scientists soon retracted their claims, the priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and <b>American</b> <b>scientists,</b> and it was not until 1997 that International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) credited the Soviet team with the discovery, but retained nobelium, the Swedish proposal, as the name of the element due to its long-standing use in the literature.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, many {{claims of}} the {{synthesis}} of lawrencium of varying quality were made from laboratories in the Soviet Union and the United States.

5|$|The {{final cost}} of Apollo was {{reported}} to Congress as $25.4 billion in 1973, It took {{up the majority of}} NASA's budget while it was being developed.
