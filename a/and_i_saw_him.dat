500|$|Although they {{initially}} parted on {{good terms}} when Taylor retired in May 1982, the relationship was finally damaged permanently after a dispute over the transfer in May 1983 of John Robertson from Forest to Derby, where Taylor was now managing. Clough was apparently angered that Taylor did not inform him about the deal. Clough attacked Taylor in a tabloid article on 3 July 1983 as being a [...] "rattlesnake", [...] "a snake-in-the-grass" [...] and said that [...] "We pass {{each other on the}} A52 going to work on most days of the week. But if his car broke down <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> thumbing a lift, I wouldn't pick him up, I'd run him over". The two men would never speak to one another again.|$|E

Bangladesh Nationalist Party chief Khaleda Zia said [...] "as a nuclear scientist, he engaged himself in the welfare of the people". Ashraf Ghani, the President of Afghanistan, called Kalam [...] "an inspirational figure to millions of people," [...] noting that [...] "we have a lot to learn from his life". Nepalese Prime Minister Sushil Koirala recalled Kalam's scientific contributions to India: [...] "Nepal has lost a good friend and I have lost an honoured and ideal personality."

The President of Sri Lanka, Maithripala Sirisena, also expressed his condolences.

2500|$|When Taylor signed John Robertson from Forest without informing Clough, it was, {{according}} to Robertson, [...] "the straw {{that broke the}} camel's back" [...] {{and the two men}} would never speak again.

2500|$|Poirier faced Conor McGregor on September 27, 2014 at UFC 178. He {{lost the}} fight by TKO {{in the first}} round. This {{resulted}} in him being stopped by strikes {{for the first time}} in his career. On his match with Conor McGregor he said “I always saw it as a plus but the Conor McGregor fight was the turning point.

2500|$|McCreight next saw the Colonel in {{the main}} {{dining room of the}} Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the close of his 1915 season. Cody was having breakfast with his wife and McCreight joined them for a chat. McCreight was {{surprised}} at the Colonel’s appearance. He had aged greatly since their last meeting. His hair was a mass of straggling, wispy white and his face was deeply wrinkled. “We talked about Iron Tail's death, and Cody almost wept in his grief. He keenly regretted not receiving my wire, believing as I did that the ailing chief might have recovered among friends at The Wigwam. Tactfully I changed the subject.” “He said that he would go out again for the 1916 season, and hoped to see us at the Wigwam on that roundup. But the old Colonel was about {{at the end of the}} long trail.” [...] McCreight’s last meeting with Buffalo Bill was in 1916. “He went out as promised at the start of the 1916 campaign <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> at the end of the last performance. Going to his tent at the rear of the show-grounds, I found him lying on his blankets, with his snowy head resting on his saddle. He was asleep, but roused at once at my greeting. He arose, shook hands, and immediately spoke of Iron Tail. With deep emotion, he said he was going to put a granite stone on the chief's grave, with a replica of the Buffalo nickel (for which Iron Tail had posed) carved on it as a memento. Cody's voice trembled as he again expressed his great regret at not receiving my telegram that might have saved Iron Tail's life. I was shocked and saddened to observe how feeble he was. I helped him to his feet, guided him to his private car and saw him to his berth. I shook hands with him for the last time. Not long after, Buffalo Bill went to his last long sleep.” [...] Col. Cody died on January 10, 1917, just six months after Chief Iron Tail's death. In a ceremony at Buffalo Bill's grave on Lookout Mountain, west of Denver, Colorado, Chief Flying Hawk laid his war staff of eagle feathers on the grave. Each of the veteran Show Indians placed a Buffalo nickel on the imposing stone as a symbol of the Indian, the buffalo, and the scout, figures since the 1880s that were symbolic of the early history of the American West. Chief Flying Hawk's dear friends Buffalo Bill and Chief Iron Tail had gone to the Sand Hills.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{looked up}} over my {{shoulder}} from the table at which I was sitting <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|There was {{a little}} red in Hoden's pale cheeks <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> swallow hard. I had struck deep again.|$|E
60|$|Before I {{had reached}} the lodge, where I had left my bicycle, <b>I</b> met Brownster, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> put my hand into my pocket. He had {{certainly}} been very attentive.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} no speech with him. He but reached the castle, himself, late last night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> this morning {{when he came to}} {{announce}} your presence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not till December. And oh! that gentleman, the conductor, he {{knew all}} about it, <b>I</b> could see, <b>and</b> by <b>and</b> by <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{lingering}} about the shop, {{as if he wanted}} to watch me." ...|$|R
60|$|My husband drew {{a little}} nearer towards Ada, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> solemnly lift {{up his hand}} to warn my guardian.|$|E
60|$|When I {{got on the}} coach, {{the driver}} had not taken his seat, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> talking to the landlady.|$|E
60|$|Lesage dashed to the fireplace, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{thrust his}} papers into the blaze and grind {{them down with}} his heel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps so. He {{told the}} girl {{he was a friend}} from New York. I went down first, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> was almost scared to death. I thought I was looking at a ghost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Does he--really <b>and</b> truly? <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> out of {{the little}} passage window, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought he looked quite thin! And Lizzie Bruce said Mrs. Hartley asked who that {{handsome}} young man was who looked so delicate.' ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{certainly}} very cruelly said; but Mr. Huddlestone {{was a man}} who attracted little sympathy; <b>and,</b> although <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> wince <b>and</b> shudder, <b>I</b> mentally endorsed the rebuke; nay, I added a contribution of my own.|$|R
60|$|The man moved away, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> in {{a corner}} talking to Louis. Lamartine served the grouse, and leaned {{across the table to}} me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't kill it, Prendick!" [...] cried Moreau. [...] "Don't kill it!" [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> stooping as {{he pushed}} through under the fronds of the big ferns.|$|E
6000|$|... "In your cottage. I saw {{him sitting}} at your table, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> come out. He looked terribly troubled, just {{as though he}} had found out something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is indeed}} kind," [...] murmured Thomasin. [...] "I was once acquainted with <b>him,</b> aunt, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> today <b>I</b> thought I should prefer his van to any {{conveyance}} of a stranger.

6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} of <b>him</b> <b>and</b> once <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> a few moons ago passing through Pinetown. A Kaffir with him {{told me that he}} was going over the Drakensberg to hunt for things that crawl and fly, being quite mad, Baas." ...|$|R
60|$|From the {{distance}} came similar cries, only pitched deeper, {{into a sort}} of roaring bass. These grew momentarily louder, <b>and</b> soon <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> approaching, my father--at least, by all the evidence of the times, I am driven to conclude that he was my father.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My duty {{called me}} to the Lobby when our shop shut up; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> there, sir,' Mr Tappertit replied, {{as he and his}} lieutenants took their seats. 'How do YOU do?' ...|$|E
60|$|My friend, having {{presented}} me, mentioned {{my desire}} to inspect the establishment, and received Monsieur Maillard's assurance that he would show me all attention, now took leave, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I said, [...] "he {{was here}} a minute ago, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> follow a gentleman away. I think I could find him {{for you if}} you would like me to try." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was {{a gentleman}} who called now <b>and</b> then; <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> twice. He had been an officer in father's ship, I think, or had known him long ago at sea. He found us out somehow in Chelsea. There {{was no one else}} at all." ...|$|R
60|$|So, for {{the first}} <b>and</b> last time, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> So the Visitation of God ruled it that he <b>and</b> <b>I</b> should meet.|$|R
