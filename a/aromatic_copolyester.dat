40|$|The {{objectives}} of the research included a study of melt spinning characterizations of thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers (TLCPs) and {{an examination of the}} feasibility of introducing a second TLCP as a 2 ̆ 7 coupling agent 2 ̆ 7 to improve the adhesion between components in normally incompatible TLCP/thermoplastic blends. The effect of processing conditions during isothermal melt spinning of two TLCPs, a wholly <b>aromatic</b> <b>copolyester</b> KU- 9211 (also named K 161) and an aliphatic containing TLCP, PET/PHB 60, on fiber properties were conducted. Among the processing variables studied, the draw ratio was the primary factor in determining both the fiber modulus and the molecular orientation. A composite model based on a rigid-rod rotation mechanism and the deformation of nematic domains in an elongational flow field was used to model the experimental results and was compared with other theories available in the literature. Conformance of experimental data to the composite model was obtained by using a single temperature dependent parameter n, suggesting that the rigid-rod rotation mechanism could be used to predict the orientation development of TLCPs. ^ With regard to the second objective, thermotropic LCP/LCP fiber blends containing K 161 and PET/PHB 60 as the constituents were prepared by a combination of melt-blending and hot-drawing. Morphological evidence showed that the dispersed phase consisted primarily of highly oriented, 0. 5 to 2 μm diameter rigid-rods of aromatic fibers imbedded in a matrix of predominantly aliphatic TLCP fibrils with diameters in the range of 20 to 50 nm. An interphase of approximately 50 nm strongly bonded the two phases together. It was found that the processing conditions employed for melt blending had caused PET/PHB 60 to undergo chain scission, thereby creating chemical interactions between the two TLCP components during the melt blending process. Preliminary studies on ternary systems confirmed the concept of using a second TLCP phase, PET/PHB 60, to improve the adhesion of binary K 161 /PET blends. It was also found that the adhesion between the reinforcing K 161 and the matrix PET phases depended on both the absolute content of the coupling PET/PHB 60 phase introduced and the relative composition of the two thermotropic LCPs. ...|$|E

Crystal-nematic and nematic-isotropic endotherms were observed on heating; however, degradation took place near the isotropization temperature. Thus, on cooling, the sequence was reversible only if the previous heating was beyond the crystal-nematic but below the isotropization temperature.

Hereto, a number of copolyesters, varying in molar mass and chemical composition (CC) were synthesized, which allowed a systematic study {{on the effects of}} those parameters in GPEC. By RP-GPEC, highly detailed separations were obtained. Information on chemical composition differences could, however, only be obtained for the lower molar masses. From these results, qualitative evidence for differences in the chemical microstructure of two strongly resembling copolyesters was found that could not be obtained by other methods such as SEC and NMR. Nevertheless, it was found difficult to unambiguously assign observed differences in the high molar mass parts of RP-GPEC chromatograms. Therefore, RP-GPEC must mainly be considered as a versatile, qualitative fingerprinting tool. In contrast, NP-GPEC provides more and quantitative information on microstructural differences.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this dissertation was the synthesis and modification of thermotropic liquid crystalline copolyesters to be blended with isotropic engineering thermoplastics such as PET. There {{has been a lot}} of interest in the last several years in the blending of thermotropic LCPs with engineering thermoplastics to form in situ composites. Yet, due to the typically high melt transitions of highly aromatic thermotropic LCPs, several methods have been studied in this dissertation to reduce the melt transitions of LCPs to within the processing window of engineering thermoplastics. ^ Three series of thermotropic, <b>aromatic</b> <b>copolyesters</b> derived from EHQ, PHQ, HQ, EG, and TA were synthesized, and characterized by PLM, DSC, NMR, TGA, and solution viscometry. It was shown that the melt transition was effectively reduced through the copolymerization of the monomers. For melt blending with engineering thermoplastics, such as PET, the transition temperatures for the Series III samples were too high, while some of the Series I and II copolymers with low amounts of PT units had thermal transitions in the range which would make them more favorable for blending. ^ Several different liquid crystalline copolyesters were thermally post-treated successfully to increase their degree of randomness. Both poly(ethoxyphenylene terephthalate-co-ethylene terephthalate) s and poly(phenylphenylene terephthalate-co-ethylene terephthalate) s were thermally randomized. It was found that increased randomness numbers caused decreased melt transition temperatures and crystallization temperatures. The more random sequence distributions also resulted in a decreased crystallinity of the copolyesters as observed by reduced enthalpies of fusion and crystallization. ^ Two different LC copolyesters, poly(EPT-co-ET) and poly(PPT-co-ET), were solution blended with PET using a mixture solvent of TFAA/Chloroform. Four different samples of each LC copolyester, with varying degrees of randomness, were used in the blends. The blends were characterized by DSC, polarized light microscopy, and rheological testing. It was observed that the melt viscosity of the blend had a strong dependence on the degree of randomness of the LC copolymer used. The copolyesters with high degrees of randomness caused a reduction of the melt viscosity. ...|$|R
40|$|The present {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{in an attempt}} to improve several important properties of polypropylene (PP) by utilizing 5 to 30 wt% of superior polymers in polypropylene polyblends. Mechanical, morphological, rheological, and creep properties of blends of polypropylene and two thermotropic liquid crystal polymers (Rodrun 3000 and Vectra A- 950) based on wholly <b>aromatic</b> <b>copolyesters</b> have been investigated. Two compatibilizers (PP-g-AA and PP-g-MA) were selected for these incompatible blends of PP with liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) to improve interfacial properties. Blends were prepared using a single-screw extruder with mixing head. These immiscible blends of PP with two LCPs were significantly improved in morphology and mechanical properties through the selected compatibilizers. In the case of the self-reinforcement of LCP polyblends, LCPs easily form fibrillar structures in the PP matrix and the aspect ratio of these fibrillar structures increases with increased draw ratios. The compatibilizers increased the mechanical properties of polyblend strands considerably up to 5 times in tensile modulus and 3 times in tensile strength over virgin polypropylene. This is comparable or even exceeds the corresponding values of glass-reinforced PP. Considerable creep resistance was observed for PP/LCP polyblends and the creep modulus of reinforced strands showed up to 23 fold increase compared with virgin polypropylene. The influence of liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) on the primary crystallization process of polypropylene was investigated both in isothermal and non-isothermal crystallization behavior with a DSC instrument. The time required to complete the primary crystallization appears to be considerably reduced by the presence of liquid crystal polymers. However, the maximum crystallinity of PP is not affected in the presence of liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) in isothermal crystallization. The melt viscosity of these polyblends is found to be lower than virgin PP. Their reduction in viscosity is dramatic at low shear rates. The significantly higher rate of crystallization of PP and lowered melt viscosity of blends have been projected to be beneficial for injection molding. These compatibilized PP/LCP blends overcome some of the disadvantages of glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene (GRP), namely, high melt viscosities of GRP, difficulties in processing and molding, and abrasiveness to compounding equipments and molds. As a result, LCPs may provide a more efficient reinforcement for polypropylene than does glass fibers, considering all of the above factors...|$|R

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), and {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) were employed to investigate the structure and properties of the resulting fibers. Mechanical properties of the fibers were also evaluated. It was found that both the crystallite size and heat of fusion of the liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) increase steadily with draw ratio. However, the crystal-nematic transition temperature of the LCP is virtually unaffected by drawing. Moreover, heat of fusion of LCP is much smaller than that of isotropic condensation polymers {{despite the presence of}} very sharp diffraction peaks in WAXS measurements. These results are ascribed to the (semi) rigid rod nature of the LCP chains and the persistence of an ordered structure in the LCP melt, i. e., entropy effect. It was further observed that tensile modulus and tensile strength along fiber axis rise with draw ratio for the composite fibers. The elastic modulus of the composite fibers were found to be as high as 19 GPa and tensile strength reached 146 MPa with draw ratios below 40 and an LCP content of 30 wt%.
