5|$|After Banner, Briskin {{returned}} to work <b>at</b> <b>Columbia</b> Pictures, where he began producing for them in 1926, and in 1928 he was given control over 18 of their productions. By 1929, Briskin had risen to be a top executive at the studio, sharing honors with studio head Harry Cohn, in giving the closing address at Columbia's annual sales meeting in July 1929. By the end of 1929, Briskin was the assistant general manager of Columbia, and {{on a visit to}} New York City signed several Broadway playwrights to long-term contracts with the studio, including Elmer Harris, Jo Swerling, and Paul Hervey Fox. Not only was Briskin active in the production office <b>at</b> <b>Columbia,</b> but he also played on Columbia's baseball team, which competed in the Motion Picture Baseball League. It was while working <b>at</b> <b>Columbia</b> that Briskin met Frank Capra. In 1930, Briskin's brother Irving, who he had employed while at Banner, joined him as a producer <b>at</b> <b>Columbia.</b>|$|E

5|$|In September 1941, Allison {{joined the}} S-1 Section, which coordinated the early {{investigations}} into the feasibility of an atomic bomb. He began building a reactor in the squash courts under the disused stands of Stagg Field. He became head of the Metallurgical Laboratory's chemistry section in January 1942, and in March, his small experimental reactor using beryllium came closer to criticality than the graphite-moderated design of Enrico Fermi's group <b>at</b> <b>Columbia</b> University. During 1942, Compton brought all the research groups working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design <b>at</b> <b>Columbia</b> University, Princeton University and the University of California together at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago.

Sixteen percent of students <b>at</b> <b>Columbia</b> receive Federal Pell Grants, which mostly go to students whose family incomes are below $40,000. Fifteen percent of students are the first member of their family to attend a four-year college.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} a chain {{reaction}} to occur, fissioning uranium atoms had to emit additional neutrons to keep the reaction going. <b>At</b> <b>Columbia</b> University in New York, Enrico Fermi, John Dunning, Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States on 25 January 1939. Subsequent work confirmed that fast neutrons were indeed produced by fission. Szilard obtained permission {{from the head of}} the Physics Department <b>at</b> <b>Columbia,</b> George B. Pegram, to use a laboratory for three months, and persuaded Walter Zinn to become his collaborator. They conducted a simple experiment on the seventh floor of Pupin Hall <b>at</b> <b>Columbia,</b> using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. They discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible.|$|E

5|$|Smyth {{studied at}} Clinton Grammar School in his youth. He became {{interested}} in geology at a young age: his native region of Upstate New York had many fossils, and his family's business involved extracting the local iron ore. In 1884, he entered Hamilton College in Clinton, where he studied science. After a year he transferred to the School of Mines <b>at</b> <b>Columbia</b> University. <b>At</b> <b>Columbia</b> {{he was president of}} the Glee Club.

5|$|The {{scientists}} <b>at</b> <b>Columbia</b> {{decided that}} they should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium when bombarded by neutrons. On 25 January 1939, {{in the basement of}} Pupin Hall <b>at</b> <b>Columbia,</b> an experimental team including Fermi conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States. The other members of the team were Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, John R. Dunning, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack. The next day, the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics began in Washington, D.C. under the joint auspices of George Washington University and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. There, the news on nuclear fission was spread even further, which fostered many more experimental demonstrations.|$|E

5|$|As 1938 began, {{there was}} much {{speculation}} as to where Briskin would go next. He {{was considered one of}} the top film executives in the industry. In mid-May, it was reported that Briskin was in negotiations with Sam Cohn to return to his former studio, Columbia, in the role of general manager. However, his name was still being discussed for other major positions throughout the industry, such as the production head at Universal Pictures. On May 26 it was announced that Briskin and Columbia had reached a 7-year agreement for him to take over {{as the head of the}} production at the studio, where he resumed his former position of general manager on May 30. As part of the agreement, Briskin was issued stock options on 10,000 shares of Columbia stock, with a value of $13.875 per share. Briskin's return to Columbia would also reunite him with his brother, Irving, who had been a producer <b>at</b> <b>Columbia</b> for several years. Samuel Briskin's would be one of the top money earners in Hollywood in 1938, his earnings topping $106,000, putting him in the top 10 <b>at</b> <b>Columbia.</b>|$|E
