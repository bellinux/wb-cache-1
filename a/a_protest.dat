50|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} assessment reforms under Proposition 218 is how <b>a</b> majority <b>protest</b> is determined. Rather than being based on an absolute majority, as was the case prior to Proposition 218, <b>a</b> majority <b>protest</b> is now determined based on the assessment ballots actually received by the local agency. If a property owner does not properly return an assessment ballot, that fact will not count for or against the proposed assessment. Proposition 218 also does not allow an agency to overrule <b>a</b> majority <b>protest.</b> If <b>a</b> majority <b>protest</b> exists under Proposition 218, the agency is prohibited from imposing the proposed assessment.|$|R
