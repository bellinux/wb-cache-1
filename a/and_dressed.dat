5|$|TNA held a Black Tie Brawl and Chain {{match between}} Jay Lethal and Sonjay Dutt, which lasted 11 minutes and 14 seconds. In this match, both {{competitors}} were tied together via a chain <b>and</b> <b>dressed</b> in tuxedos. The {{only way to}} win was to strip their opponent of the tuxedo and either make them submit or pin them afterwards. Lethal won the encounter after jumping off of a turnbuckle to drive his elbow into Dutt's chest and followed with the pin.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{management}} {{were very}} upset with Sean Waltman after {{he failed to}} appear {{to participate in the}} Four Way Elimination Tag Team match. This anger was due to Waltman being one-half of the winners of the Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament.

Waltman was not used by TNA until January15, 2006 when he appeared at their Final Resolution PPV event.|$|E
5|$|The {{belief of}} many {{followers}} that their founder was {{the incarnation of}} the Supreme God has also drawn criticism. According to Professor Raymond B.

5|$|Another {{prominent}} {{church in}} the capital, the Church of the Holy Apostles, which {{had been in a}} very poor state {{near the end of the}} 5th century, was likewise rebuilt. Works of embellishment were not confined to churches alone: excavations at the site of the Great Palace of Constantinople have yielded several high-quality mosaics dating from Justinian's reign, and a column topped by a bronze statue of Justinian on horseback <b>and</b> <b>dressed</b> in a military costume was erected in the Augustaeum in Constantinople in 543. Rivalry with other, more established patrons from the Constantinopolitan and exiled Roman aristocracy (like Anicia Juliana) might have enforced Justinian's building activities in the capital as a means of strengthening his dynasty's prestige.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundCutaneous adverse drug {{reactions}} frequently {{present as}} a benign maculopapular exanthema (MPE) with a rapid healing. Sometimes systemic signs are present, which could represent a more severe or systemic MPE (sMPE) or even be the initial {{phase of a}} drug reaction with eosinophilia <b>and</b> systemic symptoms (<b>DRESS).</b> Histopathology associated with MPE, sMPE <b>and</b> <b>DRESS</b> has not been well characterized. ObjectivesTo study the cutaneous histopathological changes associated with MPE, sMPE <b>and</b> <b>DRESS.</b> MethodsA retrospective clinicopathological analysis of 13 cases of MPE, 13 of sMPE <b>and</b> 45 of <b>DRESS,</b> collected in one centre from 2005 to 2013. ResultsThe number of histopathological changes per section increased gradually from MPE to sMPE <b>and</b> <b>DRESS.</b> Prevalence of spongiosis, dermal lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils did not differ between MPE, sMPE <b>and</b> <b>DRESS.</b> Keratinocyte damage, rare in MPE, was regularly found in sMPE <b>and</b> frequent in <b>DRESS.</b> The density of the inflammatory infiltrate increased progressively from MPE to sMPE <b>and</b> <b>DRESS.</b> Atypical lymphocytes were absent in MPE, present in sMPE and more frequent in DRESS. Deep dermal involvement and leukocytoclastic vasculitis were only observed in DRESS. LimitationsThis was a retrospective study. ConclusionsNumerous histopathological changes per section in drug-induced exanthema should alert for a more severe form of cutaneous adverse drug reactions, i. e. DRESS...|$|R

5|$|Near {{midnight on}} 20 May, Eichmann was sedated by an Israeli doctor on the Mossad team <b>and</b> <b>dressed</b> as a flight attendant. He was smuggled out of Argentina aboard the same El Al Bristol Britannia {{aircraft}} {{that had a}} few days earlier carried Israel's delegation to the official 150th anniversary celebration of Argentina's independence from Spain. After a tense delay at the airport getting the flight plan approved, the plane took off for Israel, stopping over in Dakar, Senegal, to refuel. They arrived in Israel on 22 May, and Ben-Gurion announced Eichmann's capture to the Knesset—Israel's parliament—the following afternoon. In Argentina, the abduction was met with a violent wave of antisemitism carried out by far-right elements, including the Tacuara Nationalist Movement.|$|E

A {{domestic}} Barbary macaque belonging to the steward of the palace's grapevines attacked or was attacked by the king's German Shepherd Dog, Fritz, and Alexander attempted to separate the two animals. As he did so, another monkey attacked Alexander and bit him deeply on the leg and torso. Eventually servants arrived and chased away the monkeys, and the king's wounds were promptly cleaned <b>and</b> <b>dressed</b> but not cauterized.

5|$|Psycho {{is based}} on Robert Bloch's 1959 novel of the same name, which was loosely {{inspired}} by the case of convicted Wisconsin murderer and grave robber Ed Gein. Both Gein (who lived just 40 miles from Bloch) and the story's protagonist, Norman Bates, were solitary murderers in isolated rural locations. Each had deceased, domineering mothers, had sealed off a room in their home as a shrine to her, <b>and</b> <b>dressed</b> in women's clothes. However, unlike Bates, Gein is not strictly considered a serial killer, having been charged with murder only twice.|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate how perceived stressful conditions (PSC) and perceived non-stressful conditions (PNSC) influence eating <b>and</b> <b>dressing</b> behaviors of Chinese females. Chinese female university students (18 – 30  years) residing in the United States, completed a validated and reliable 45 -itemized Chinese Stress Eating <b>and</b> <b>Dressing</b> Survey (CSEDS). The CSEDS included: (i) effort to control making healthy eating choices <b>and</b> <b>dressing,</b> (ii) foods eaten <b>and</b> <b>dress</b> items selected during PSC, (iii) foods eaten <b>and</b> <b>dress</b> items selected during PNSC, and (iv) demographics. Seven comfort food categories and eight appearance categories were used. The CSEDS included multiple choice, yes/no, and Likert scale questions. Statistical analyses were performed using t tests. A total of 129 females completed the CSEDS. Mean body mass index (BMI) calculated from reported heights and weights was 20.86  ±  3.86. From PNSC to PSC, there were significant decreases in all dressing patterns (p < . 028), and the majority of the participants reported dressing casually during PSC (78.3 %). Overall, there was a decrease in the types of foods eaten during PNSC to PSC, but significance was noted for common foods (e.g., Chinese, Other Asian, Italian, American, and Mexican; p = . 033), mixed dishes (e.g., casseroles, soy and vegetable based dishes, meat entrees, and salads; p = . 018), and soft foods (e.g., rice, noodles, bread, dumplings, and eggs; p = . 003). During PSC, Chinese females tended to select a limited variety of foods, forgo appearance enhancement items, <b>and</b> <b>dress</b> casually suggesting that ethnic groups vary in eating <b>and</b> <b>dressing</b> behaviors. Findings from this research contribute to the body of knowledge related to stress and its influence on appearance (eating <b>and</b> <b>dressing)</b> behaviors specifically of Chinese female university students when transitioning from one country to another.|$|R

5|$|St Edwen's {{is built}} from local red gritstone, formed into square blocks <b>and</b> <b>dressed</b> with sandstone. The roof {{is made from}} slate with stone edging. The church, {{which is in the}} Late Decorated style, has a tower topped with a broach spire at the north-west corner of the nave, {{supported}} by buttresses. The church is entered through a porch with an arched doorway in the lowest of the three stages of the tower. Inside, the woodwork of the roof is exposed; some of the nave timbers might be medieval beams reused in the 1856 rebuilding. The nave and chancel are divided by an arch and by three steps leading up from the nave. The chancel and sanctuary are separated by an altar rail set on top of some wooden panels.|$|E
5|$|The Annunciation was {{a popular}} theme in European art, {{although}} a difficult scene to paint, because it depicts Mary's union with Christ as she becomes the tabernacle for the Word made flesh. Mary as Theotokos, the God-bearer, was affirmed in 431 at the Council of Ephesus; two decades later the Council of Chalcedon affirmed the doctrine of Incarnation– that Christ was of two natures (God and Man)– and her perpetual virginity was affirmed at the Lateran Council of 631. In Byzantine art, Annunciation scenes depict the Virgin enthroned <b>and</b> <b>dressed</b> in royal regalia. In later centuries she was shown in enclosed spaces: the temple, the church, the garden.|$|E

5|$|In Bengal, on {{the night}} of the sixth day after childbirth, a number of items may be placed in the lying-in chamber in {{deference}} to Shashthi, such as an earthen pitcher of water covered with a napkin, offerings of husked rice, cooked rice, bananas and sweets, bangles, and pieces of gold and silver. A pen and paper are also kept in the room, because it is believed that Shashthi (or, according to some traditions, Chitragupta or Brahma) comes into the home after everyone is asleep and writes the child's fortune on the paper with invisible ink. In Bihar, the sixth day ceremony is called Chathi or Chati ("sixth") and Shashthi is known by the epithet Chati Mata ("Mother Chati"). A lump of cow dung dressed in red cloth or paper and covered with vermilion, symbolising the goddess, is kept in the lying-in room. Here, the new-born baby is oiled <b>and</b> <b>dressed</b> in new clothes and rings and then named; a feast follows this ceremony. Childless people may perform a vrata (ritual) in worship of Shashthi, called either Chati Mata or Shashthi Vrata, in an effort to conceive.|$|E
