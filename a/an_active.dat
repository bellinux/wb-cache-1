40|$|Dark green leafy {{vegetables}} (DGLV) are {{rich source of}} pro-vitamin A carotenoids, with all-trans-b-carotene as the main compound contributing over 90 % of the vitamin A content. The other pro-vitamin A carotenoids present in DGLV are the cis isomers of b-carotene; the 9 -cis and the 13 -cis, and a-carotene in some vegetables. The dehydration processes of freeze-, solar- and sun-drying resulted in all-trans-b-carotene undergoing isomerization and oxidation to produce cis isomers and monoepoxides of b-carotene, which are pro-vitamin <b>A</b> <b>active,</b> and some volatile compounds. The isomerization process results in {{the reduction of the}} relative proportions of all-trans isomer and an increase in the relative proportion of the cis isomers. Oxidation of all-trans-b-carotene induced the formation of vitamin <b>A</b> <b>active</b> epoxides; 5, 6 - and 5, 8 -monoepoxides of b-carotene as intermediate products that decompose to smaller volatile compounds. The epoxides were detected in low but sometimes in measurable amounts on some dehydrated and/or stored vegetable samples. The vitamin <b>A</b> <b>active</b> degradative compounds of all-trans-b-carotene were monitored using isocratic HPLC procedures. The factors influencing degradation of pro-vitamin A carotenoids during dehydration are discussed...|$|R
