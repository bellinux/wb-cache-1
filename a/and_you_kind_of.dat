However, for unknown reasons, the video was scrapped, and Hilson re-shot a clip for the video with [...] "Knock You Down" [...] and [...] "Number One" [...] director Chris Robinson. Robinson told Rap-Up, [...] "Keri Hilson has a great personality and is a real girl. That’s what we want to get across."

It is a bit of that, but it’s a bit toned down for the video, because you got so much censoring, I can’t do everything I do on stage (laughs). So when people come out they’re probably still gonna be a bit surprised to see it live, after seeing the video. But I’m very pleased with the video. I love the colours and it’s reminiscent of the whole late 70s early 80s era in music." [...] Chris Brown, Omarion, Monica, Melody Thornton, and Polow Da Don all appear in the video. The video begins with Hilson, dressed lavishly, arriving late to a Jeep full of the previous stated people. The clip flips back to what happened earlier that night, showing Hilson getting ready in a seductive fashion, as she chooses perfume and picks out clothes. Scenes of Hilson performing in front of a leather-like wall are interspersed in between her and her friends riding down a boulevard to the club. Once she arrives to the club, she is attracted to a particular man, and subsequently performs elaborate, sensual choreography with him and other dancers, before slow dancing.

So this song was kind of like, 'Shake yourself out of it, things will be OK,'. Because sometimes I have to write songs for myself, reminding me to let it go.

5000|$|Reflektor {{is an art}} {{rock and}} dance-rock album. Primary lyricist Win Butler notes that the 1959 film Black Orpheus {{inspired}} his lyrics on the album, in particular its themes of isolation and death: [...] "Black Orpheus {{is one of my}} favorite films of all time, which is set in Carnival in Brazil. The Orpheus myth is the original love triangle, Romeo and Juliet kind of story. Lyrically, it's not literally about my life. I feel like I'm kind of a bit of a sponge in a way. Like, if people around me are going through things, I find it very hard not to be empathetic." [...] Also influential to the album's lyrical content is an essay by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, entitled [...] "Two Ages". Butler states, [...] "It's about the reflective age. This is like in 1846, and it sounds like he's talking about modern times.

5000|$|... "Right Thru Me" [...] is styled with pop-rap tones, {{and has an}} {{electronic}} beat, while being influenced by R&B. Lyrically, the song describes someone who wonders aloud about how a lover can see the real her. Lyrically, [...] "Moment 4 Life", is about a desire to maintain a feeling of accomplishment, as Drake follows behind Minaj and raps the same theme of enjoying the moment. Straying away from the standard rap song construction of three verses and a hook, Nicki performs a brain-dump of sorts on the track, spitting as if she’s making a speech to both her fans and detractors. [...] "Check It Out" [...] features the nearly constant repetition of the piano and vocal hook from The Buggles 1979 classic, [...] "Video Killed the Radio Star", which is famous for being the first video ever played on MTV. [...] "Super Bass" [...] utilizes electronic music and pop in its composition, while Minaj raps over a hip hop beat, Minaj explained the song's concept, stating: [...] "'Super Bass' is about the boy that you are crushing over, ... <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{want to get your}} mack on, but you're taking the playful approach." ...|$|E

It seemed so hectic and crazy, and I was sure I wasn't ready to deal with that." [...] She was, however, persuaded when her father said that the show would be about her album and music, which she thought was [...] "kind of cool": [...] "You're actually seeing a deeper look into how this album got made." [...] She also wanted to prevent people from thinking that she was [...] "just like Jessica", so she thought the show [...] "was the smartest way {{to put an end to}} the comparisons." [...] She said in one interview: [...] "I chose to do it because it's like a making of the album but at the same time they come into my real life too. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> get to see everything I go through in the process.

5000|$|... "Super Bass" [...] was co-written by Minaj, Ester Dean, Roahn Hylton, and Daniel [...] "Kane Beatz" [...] Johnson, who {{produced}} the song alongside JMIKE. While being interviewed by MTV News during the video shoot for the single, Minaj explained the song's concept, stating: [...] "'Super Bass' {{is about the}} boy that you are crushing over, ... <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{want to get your}} mack on, but you're taking the playful approach." [...] The song utilizes electronic music and pop in its composition, while Minaj raps over a hip hop beat, while also infusing elements of J-pop combined with an upbeat hook. [...] It uses a busy beat that is interspersed with digital rain drop sound effects and strong bass. Minaj's vocals in the song have been described as [...] "breathy". [...] "Super Bass" [...] is written in the key of B major with a moderate tempo of 128 beats per minute. Despite writing in the key of B major, the song has no B major chords. Minaj's lyrics in the song are often provocative and suggestive, with lines like [...] "He just gotta give me that look, when he give me that look / Then the panties comin' off, off, uh" [...] and a catchy onomatopoetic refrain: [...] "Boom, badoom, boom, boom, badoom, boom, bass, he got dat super bass".|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{completing}} the tour {{and returning to}} Brooklyn, Lopatin rented a small, windowless basement studio and began recording new material. Drawing on his experiences touring, he noted that [...] "a lot of my thoughts on the record were about dealing with puberty and how your pubescent body is essentially the staging area for all this mutation." [...] Other inspirations included the video hosting service Vevo, satellite radio stations such as Ozzy's Boneyard and Lithium, and the writing of French philosopher Julia Kristeva (in particular, her influential 1980 essay Powers of Horror). About the latter, Lopatin explained, Kristeva talks about the abject things that come out that we have desire to see. So {{the things that we}} try to contain within us is like this pre-semiotic reality and society is the way we want to present ourselves ... And yet, when the stuff comes out — like, you sneeze <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{want to look at the}} napkin for a second ... So I started thinking, that's a good formal constraint, like how do I kind of vaguely represent things that leak or things that are kind of disgusting but still seductive? [...] In addition, the isolated recording environment encouraged an abrasive and dense sound relative to Oneohtrix Point Never's recent releases, with Lopatin stating that [...] "I was making pretty aggressive, nihilistic stuff early on and kind of went away from that for a bit. In some ways I feel like I’m back now." ...|$|E

I kind of feel like I’m ready to take a risk before I hit 30 and realize that actually I’ve missed my opportunity. A calculated risk." [...] At the same time, Burnet issued his own reasons for returning. He told The Sun: [...] "I’ve had so much support from fans since I left the show, so it’s great {{to have the opportunity to}} reprise the storyline and give viewers a resolution to the Craig and John Paul story." [...] Sutton stated that he wanted Burnet to come back. [...] "I was always very keen for Guy to come back and I know that Bryan Kirkwood and the writers, everyone was always keen for him to come back," [...] he relayed. [...] "It was just a question if the logistics of it could work out because Guy’s been living in L.A. since he left the show, so it was just a case of scheduling it in and making sure that if I was going to leave, he could come back and film. It’s worked out perfectly." [...] Sutton had planned on leaving sooner, but stayed around longer so that Burnet could come back. [...] "I never really imagined myself staying on a show for two years," [...] he revealed. [...] "It’s a great place to work because everybody’s so young and so up for the job … <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> get caught up in it and before you know it, you’ve been there for two years.
