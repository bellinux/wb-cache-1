6000|$|Mrs. Munger laughed again, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> with a proselyting sigh, [...] "It's a pity you couldn't all {{find your}} way into the Church." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a moment's silence, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> 'His enemy! Is {{that what}} you mean? But {{then he would have}} known it was he.' ...|$|E
6000|$|His wife {{made him}} {{tell her what}} they were, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Yes, that was loathsome; I couldn't have {{believed}} it of Mr. Fulkerson." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{seemed on}} the point of making a further appeal. Her lips, even, were parted, her head a little thrown back. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> stopped. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> nothing. The silence lasted so long that he became almost embarrassed.|$|R
6000|$|The cruel {{light of}} the diamond was in Nanny's eyes for a moment, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> shuddering, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Tak your ring awa, tak it out o' my sicht." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was a small}} child, {{but very}} white, with blue eyes and dark hair that curled. Rachel gazed at it long <b>and</b> tenderly. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Bring me water while there is yet time." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Cliff sat {{for some}} minutes without answering, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Willy, you do {{sometimes}} {{get into your}} head an idea that absolutely sparkles!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Catherine {{looked at}} her lover a minute, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I shall persuade him. But I am glad we shall be rich," [...] she added.|$|E
6000|$|Edna stood {{silent for}} a few moments, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Captain, do you suppose that this dome was entirely covered by water when the lake was full?" ...|$|E
6000|$|At noon on {{the next}} day Lily had still said nothing to her mother about the letter; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> what <b>she</b> <b>said</b> was very little. [...] "When must you answer Mr. Crosbie, mamma?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She stopped, {{and turned}} till her eyes rested upon {{the face of}} La Tremouille; and so she stood, silent, {{measuring}} him, the excitement in all faces burning steadily higher and higher, and all pulses beating faster <b>and</b> faster; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> with deliberation: ...|$|R
60|$|But the Seigneur had gravely shaken {{his head}} in silent refusal, {{and there had been}} no further {{question}} of such a thing. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> when <b>she</b> <b>said</b> good-bye to him--the thing came flooding back to him now--there had been tears in her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "He won't go to-morrow," [...] thought Margery; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> to Matlack: [...] "I {{think we}} ought to know Mr. Sadler's rules. Has he any more of them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|His smile made Madame de Cintre smile. [...] "Have you formed it?" [...] she asked. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> in a {{different}} tone, [...] "Where {{do you wish to}} live?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him with a glance of blended love and mockery, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> in his ear, [...] "I feel as if we had fallen from some star." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True," [...] Gavin said, uncomfortably, {{while the}} Egyptian again toyed with her ring. She was too {{impulsive}} to be reticent except now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> suddenly <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You {{have looked at}} this ring before now. Do {{you know that if}} you had it on your finger you would be more worth robbing than with eighty pounds in each of your pockets?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Upon my word I felt {{inclined}} {{to kiss her}} and have wondered ever since if {{she would have been}} very angry. I am not certain that she did not divine the inclination. At any rate after a little pause she dropped my hands <b>and</b> laughed. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|Alice {{looked at}} him with a complex <b>and</b> {{baffling}} face; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> in a low voice: [...] "After it all, I am still glad you are brave." ...|$|R
6000|$|And the old dame {{looked at}} him through her {{spectacles}} one minute, and two, and three; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "He's sick; and a bairn's a bairn, sweep or none." ...|$|E
6000|$|A blush suffused {{the cheek}} of Edith; {{she turned her}} head a little aside, as if she were {{arranging}} some drawings. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> in a somewhat hushed and hesitating voice, ...|$|E
6000|$|Ida listened patiently {{to all my}} faint arguments, for I felt my courage quailing {{under her}} pretty {{sympathetic}} glance, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> decisively, [...] "You are quite right and yet quite wrong." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “I met a {{young lady}} at a party and she invited me {{to try out for}} rugby,” Knight recalled. “I’d never heard of rugby. She {{characterized}} it as being like football <b>and</b> soccer. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> ‘tackle’ <b>and</b> I was like ‘I’m there.’ I went to a practice the next week, and that was it.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{little girl}} {{admitted}} that <b>she</b> did not, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> smiling happily, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Oh, you must mean feek, kusk, dalu, and liben!" ...|$|R
6000|$|As we approached, she {{greeted us}} pleasantly, {{very much as}} if she had {{expected}} our coming, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> addressing Walkirk, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> with a smile: ...|$|R
6000|$|Madame Munster {{looked at}} him, and her eye {{exhibited}} a slight responsive spark. She touched {{her lips to}} a glass of wine, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Describe them. Give me a picture." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hear about what?" [...] {{his wife}} asked, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> to Reverdy, [...] "Good morning, Abel. Won't you light and have breakfast with us? It's just ready. I reckon Sally will excuse you." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{a moment}} Mrs. Archibald hesitated, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "As we are hermits, I suppose {{we must not}} keep {{together}} any {{more than we can}} help, and so I will let you go alone." ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{aunt was}} very kind, {{and talked to}} her affectionately and encouragingly of the hopes that her mother would find her father recovering, {{and that it would}} turn out after all quite an {{expedition}} of pleasure <b>and</b> refreshment. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> how much <b>she</b> rejoiced to have Gillian with her, as a companion to herself, while her sister was so busy, and she was necessarily so much left alone.|$|R
6000|$|She did {{not look}} at him and pretend ignorance, as 'Manda Grier would have done; but lifting her moist eyes <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{dropping}} them, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Why, Mr. Barker, what can you mean?" ...|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1940, Stanisław Hadyna met her for the last time, asking {{what would happen to}} the world. As he wrote in his book, Pilchowa began weeping <b>and</b> shaking, <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> in a quiet voice: This all is horrible. They are burning people in furnaces. Thousands of people, whole trainloads. They are chased across the forests and snow, behind barbed wires of camps. They are shooting. Pits filled with dead bodies.|$|R
6000|$|Pony's {{mother was}} silent for a moment as if she could not answer, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Well, all I know is, I wish there was no such boy in this town as Jim Leonard." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lemuel {{declared}} that he was perfectly comfortable, {{but she would not}} be contented till he had changed, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Why don't you look after your company, S'tira Dudley? I should think you'd be ashamed." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{was silent}} for another moment <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Father, I have a message for you. He said, 'I send my peace to him; {{and it will not}} return unto me.' He said you needed him." ...|$|E
60|$|She wasn't {{quite so}} dazzlingly {{beautiful}} {{as they are}} on the stage, but we passed that. She showed us up into the drawing-room, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> would go <b>and</b> tell her mistress we were there.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Woodward {{remained}} with her eldest daughter {{for two days}} after the trial, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> was forced to return to Hampton. She had earnestly entreated Gertrude to accompany her, with her child; but Mrs. Tudor was inflexible. <b>She</b> had, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> very much to do; so much, that she could not possibly leave London; the house and furniture were on her hands, and must be disposed of; their future plans must be arranged; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> nothing, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> should induce her to sleep out of sight of her husband's prison, or to omit any opportunity of seeing him which the prison rules would allow her.|$|R
5000|$|As a child, Treechada {{knew she}} was a girl, but {{in front of her}} parents, she had to pretend and live as a male.
