Like its predecessors, Toy Story 3 received enormous critical acclaim, earning a 99% approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes. It also grossed more than $1billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing animated film until the release of 2013's Frozen.|$|E

When we analyzed isolates with primers for the pp 65 and major immediate-early genes, we observed nearly uniform amplification yielding products of predicted sizes.

Analysis of a-sequence products from two isolates demonstrated 50 to 70 % nucleotide homology with the a sequence of HCMV Towne strain DNA. We observed 95 % nucleotide homology for the two a-sequence products derived from the father-child pair. Analysis of <b>day-care</b> <b>center</b> isolates indicated that two children excreted two distinct HCMV strains during the study interval.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study, we found fecal colonization with multiresistant Escherichia coli exhibiting high-level trimethoprim resistance in 19 % of diapered children attending six <b>day-care</b> <b>centers</b> in Houston, Tex. To examine the potential risk {{factors associated with}} this finding, we conducted cross-sectional studies among 203 children attending 12 <b>day-care</b> <b>centers,</b> 51 children attending a well-child clinic (controls), and 64 medical students. The prevalence of fecal colonization with trimethoprim-resistant E. coli among children attending <b>day-care</b> <b>centers</b> (30 %) was higher (P less than 0. 001) than among control children (6 %) or medical students (8 %). The prevalence of colonization among the children attending the 12 centers ranged from 0 to 59 % and was correlated {{with the number of}} diapered children enrolled (r = 0. 73; P less than 0. 01). In a case control study among the <b>day-care</b> <b>center</b> children, significant risk factors were an age of less than 12 months and attendance at a center with an enrollment of over 40 diapered children (odds ratios of 2. 2 and 3. 5, respectively); ethnicity, duration of attendance, and prior antibiotic administration were not associated with colonization. Plasmid analysis of 60 of the <b>day-care</b> <b>center</b> strains revealed 22 profiles, each of which was unique to <b>a</b> given <b>day-care</b> <b>center.</b> Transmission and carriage of trimethoprim-resistant strains for as long as 6 months was documented in one center studied on three occasions. Given the documented transmission of enteric pathogens among diapered children attending <b>day-care</b> <b>centers</b> and their spread into family members, it is likely that <b>day-care</b> <b>centers</b> are <b>an</b> important community reservoir of plasmid-associated antibiotic-resistant E. coli...|$|R
