5|$|Gia Long tolerated the Catholic {{faith of}} his French allies and {{permitted}} unimpeded missionary activities {{out of respect}} to his benefactors. The missionary activity was dominated by the Spanish in Tonkin and French in the central and southern regions. At {{the time of his}} death, there were six European bishops in Vietnam. The population of Christians was estimated at 300,000 in Tonkin and 60,000 in Cochinchina. However, he expressed dismay <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> condemnation of the traditional ancestor worship, a basic tenet of Vietnamese culture. Gia Long was also known for his disdain for Buddhism, the religion practiced by the majority of the population. Despite its popularity among ladies of the court, Gia Long often restricted the activities of Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|His initial {{reforms were}} aimed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> church which, {{because of its}} {{allegiance}} to the Vatican, was viewed a potentially subversive force. Joseph's first act was the proclamation of the Edict of Tolerance of 1781–82 which abolished the privileges which Catholics enjoyed over other Christian and non-Christian minorities. As {{an attack on the}} place of the church, it was deeply unpopular among Catholics, but because the non-Catholics were a tiny minority, it did not win any real support. The Edict was condemned by Cardinal Frankenberg who insisted that religious tolerance, the relaxation of censorship and the suppression of laws against the Jansenists all constituted an attack on the Catholic Church. Later, 162 monasteries whose inhabitants led a purely contemplative life were abolished. In September 1784, marriage was made a civil, rather than a religious, institution. This sharply reduced the church's traditional influence and power in its parishioners' family lives. Following this, in October 1786, the government abolished all seminaries in the territory to establish a single, state-run General Seminary (seminarium generale) in Leuven. Within the General Seminary, training would be in liberal and state-approved theology which was opposed by the upper ranks of the clergy.|$|E
5|$|Poniatowski {{died after}} a stroke on 12 February 1798. Paul I {{sponsored}} a royal state funeral, and on 3 March {{he was buried}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church of St. Catherine in St. Petersburg. In 1938, when the Soviet Union planned to demolish the Church, his remains were transferred to the Second Polish Republic, {{and put in a}} church at Wołczyn, his birthplace. This was done in secret, and it caused a controversy in Poland when the issue became known. In the 1990, due to poor state of the Wołoczyn Church (then in Belarus), his body was transferred to Poland once more, to St. John's Cathedral in Warsaw, where, on 3 May 1791, he had celebrated the adoption of the Constitution he had co-authored and endorsed. A final funeral ceremony was held on 14 February 1995.|$|E
