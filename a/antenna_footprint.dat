40|$|Remote sensing of {{sea surface}} {{salinity}} with sufficient accuracy {{to meet the}} needs of global oceanography is a challenging task. The global variability of the salinity signal in the open ocean is only a few Kelvin even at L-band and an accuracy on the order of 0. 1 K is desired to study the influence of salinity on ocean circulation and energy exchange with the atmosphere. On the other hand, resolution is not an issue for understanding the dynamics of the open ocean where scales of hundreds of km are not uncommon. This permits remote sensing with large <b>antenna</b> <b>footprints</b> and spatial averaging to reduce noise. However, <b>antennas</b> with large <b>footprints</b> introduce other problems. For example, the angle of incidence and hence the brightness temperature varies over the footprint. Similarly, the polarization of brightness temperature relative to the antenna ports changes. Studies have been conducted using antenna patterns representative of the antenna that will be flown on the Aquarius mission to examine these effects. Aquarius is a pushbroom style radiometer with three beams looking across track away from the sun. The beams are at incidences angles (at the spacecraft) of about 26. 5, 34 and 40 degrees each with a half-power beam width of about 5. 8 degrees. It is shown that the measured brightness temperature is biased relative to the value at boresight because of changes across the field of view. The bias can be as much as 4 K and positive or negative depending on polarization. Polarization mixing because of the variations of the local plane of incidence across the footprint also occur and can result in biased polarimetric measurements. A bias in the third Stokes parameter of as much as 0. 4 K is possible. Such effects may affect algorithms that use the third Stokes parameter to correct for Faraday rotation. Another issue associated with the antenna is sun glint. This is an issue determined by surface roughness and antenna sidelobes. Examples will be given for the random component (glint) for the case of the Aquarius antenna beams. Fortunately, the Aquarius beams mostly look to the dark side of the day-night termination, but during some portions of the year they will see sun-lighted ocean.

40|$|Measuring {{shallow soil}} water content is {{important}} for estimating water and energy fluxes for providing the knowledge of spatial distribution and dynamics in agricultural, hydrological, meteorological, and climatological research and applications. In that respect, the local point-scale and large-scale sensors are widely used, but the scientific demand for revealing the soil moisture dynamics at a field-scale with high spatial resolution is gaining interests. In this thesis, full-wave inversion of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data for soil characterization was studied. The advanced GPR full-wave models of Lambot et al. (2004) and Lambot and André (2013) were presented and studied in the laboratory and field conditions. The stability and repeatability of GPR systems and effects of GPR instability on inversion results were studied. Different GPR systems and antennas operating in near-field and far-field conditions were employed in the field conditions for high-resolution mapping of surface soil moisture. In addition, the effects of vegetation cover on retrieving the surface soil moisture were investigated in the laboratory and field conditions and an effective model of scattering was developed. The GPR systems based on vector network analyzer showed {{a high degree of}} stability while the impulse commercial GPR systems presented significant instability (drift), which was corrected by signal post-processing. Comparison of the field-scale soil moisture maps between the advanced far-field GPR model and traditional on-ground approaches (direct-ground wave) showed different characterization depths. Furthermore, employing different GPR systems and antennas as well as different GPR models (far-field/near-field) provides different characterization scales but the same soil moisture patterns at field scale. The numerical experiments for spatial soil moisture variability within the GPR <b>antenna</b> <b>footprint</b> showed the effective <b>antenna</b> <b>footprint</b> of about - 9 dB, which may measure the arithmetic average of the local soil moisture values.

40|$|The GNSS {{signals are}} an {{important}} active source for Earth's remote sensing in L band. Experiments performed over sea and land surfaces demonstrated the capability of GNSS-Reflected signals (GNSS-R) for remote sensing purposes. Presently, many research groups are focusing their efforts in developing GNSS-R sensors for soil moisture, sea, sea-ice, and snow cover monitoring. Applications like drought monitoring, farm production, irrigation planning, flood protection, fire prevention, and meteorological forecasts can take advantage from retrieved soil moisture content. Detected sea-surface winds could help to identify adverse meteorological conditions far from coastal zones. Sea altimetry measurements {{could be used to}} monitor tides and to identify natural hazards (i. e. tsunamis). Sea-ice topographic changes in the Arctic and Antarctic regions and dry ice stratification could be monitored in order to improve polar climatology knowledge. Recently the Remote Sensing Group of Politecnico of Turin and NavSAS laboratory of ISMB (Istituto Superiore Mario Boella) starts the design and implementation of a fully reconfigurable GNSS-R instrument for research activities, following a Software Defined Radio approach. Using this solution, the hardware is reduced to the RF stages only (i. e. antennas, demodulation, sampling) and the processing starts from the IF (Intermediate Frequency) samples of the raw signal. This is a low-cost portable observing system, designed to be easily placed for example also on board small aircrafts (also unmanned). In this sense, the system components were carefully chosen to minimize size and weight of the complete observing system. Together with the system definition, a user interface is started to be developed. Actually the interface allows a quasi real time control of the received signal. The correct estimation of the whole correlation function profile (in range and frequency space) is achieved by keeping the noise level as low as possible and increasing the SNR. Therefore, it is important to optimally process signals even when long - non coherent integration time is necessary. The interface we developed is able to process such signals using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) based acquisition algorithms. In addition, an optimized procedure is implemented to compensate for a residual code delay, enhancing the detection of weak signals. The interface allows also experimental activities planning, since it shows specular reflection points and isorange lines (inside receiver <b>antenna's</b> <b>footprint),</b> computed knowing estimated or predicted satellite positions. All the information are georeferenced using UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinate system and projected on Google© static maps. Thus, this user friendly interface is a helpful tool able to generate all the necessary output for the geophysical applications performed exploiting GNSS-R signals. In order to test instrument and interface, some experimental activities were recently done by placing the instrument on a high cliff to collect some looks from the sea surface and on board an aircraft to collects measurements from soil reflections (rice fields water flooding, soil moisture, altimetry). Another important activity is to adapt our GNSS-R system for space-based measurements in the framework of an educational project which is being carried out by students belonging to the Aerospace and ICT Engineering faculties of Politecnico of Turin. This student project is going to be developed in the framework of an initiative offered by the Education Office of the European Space Agency.

Lacking is a measure to quantify this advantage and to compare directional <b>antennas</b> of different <b>footprint</b> patterns. This paper introduces the concept of the effective beam width (and the effective null width as its dual counterpart) as a measure which quantitatively captures the capacity-boosting capability of directional antennas. Beam width is commonly defined to be the directional angle spread within which the main-lobe beam power is above a certain threshold. In contrast, our effective beam width definition lumps the effects of the (i) antenna pattern, (ii) active-node distribution, and (iii) channel characteristics, on network capacity into a single quantitative measure. We investigate the mathematical properties of the effective beam width and show how the convenience afforded by these properties {{can be used to}} analyze the effectiveness of complex directional antenna patterns in boosting network capacity, with fading and multi-user interference taken into account.

Typically, dwell times are in the order of 30 – 40 s, and over this interval the satellite’s trajectory may be approximated as a straight line. In addition, due to the much closer proximity of the receiver to the imaging scene, image resolution in the azimuth direction is predominantly defined by the relative motion of the receiver relative to the imaging area, while the contribution of the transmitter’s motion is almost negligible [13].|$|E

We assess the accuracy of GPS-based snow depth, density, and SWE data at 18 GPS sites via comparison to manual observations. The manual validation survey was completed around the time of peak accumulation at each site. Daily snow depth derived from GPS reflection data is very similar to the mean snow depth measured manually in the ∼ 1000 m 2 scale area around each antenna. This comparison spans site-averaged depths from 0 to 150 cm. The GPS depth data exhibit a small negative bias (− 6 cm) across this range of snow depths. Errors tend to be smaller at sites with more usable GPS ground tracks. Snow bulk density is modeled using the GPS snow depth time series and model parameters are estimated from nearby SNOTEL sites. Modeled density is within 0. 02 g cm− 3 of the density measured in a single snow pit at the validation sites, for 12 of 18 comparisons. GPS-based depth and modeled density are multiplied to estimate SWE. SWE estimates are very accurate over the range observed at the validation sites, from 0 to 60 cm (R 2 = 0. 97 and bias = − 2 cm).

This prototype demonstrates more than 85 % reduction in the ERA footprint alongside a drastic improvement in bandwidth over the 3 %- 4 % measured bandwidth of the classical single-feed ERAs with unprinted slabs. 8 page(s...|$|E
