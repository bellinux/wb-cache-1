40|$|High-quality {{batches of}} carbon {{nanotubes}} are produced at relatively low cost in a modified atmospheric-pressure electric-arc welding process {{that does not}} include the use of metal catalysts. What would normally be a welding rod and a weldment are replaced by an amorphous carbon <b>anode</b> <b>rod</b> and a wider, hollow graphite cathode rod. Both electrodes are water-cooled. The cathode is immersed in ice water to about 0. 5 cm from the surface. The system is shielded from air by flowing helium during arcing. As the anode is consumed during arcing at 20 to 25 A, it is lowered to maintain it at an approximately constant distance above the cathode. The process causes carbon nanotubes to form on the lowest 5 cm of the anode. The arcing process is continued until the anode has been lowered to a specified height. The nanotube-containing material is then harvested. The additional information contained in the instant report consists mostly of illustrations of carbon nanotubes and a schematic diagram of the arc-welding setup, as modified for the production of carbon nanotubes...|$|E

The switch, which had a rod-plane geometry, was filled with SF 6 at a pressure of 0. 8 bar (1. 0 bar = 100 kPa) absolute and was operated at a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 1 kHz. The erosion rates of anode and cathode electrode materials such as elkonite (a copper tungsten composite), brass, aluminum and two types of stainless steel was measured, and their surfaces were studied optically, photographed and chemically analyzed. The erosion rate of the <b>anode</b> (<b>rod)</b> electrode materials ranged from 21. 39 x 10 - 6 cm 3 C- 1 for elkonite to 60. 4 x 10 - 6 cm 3 C- 1 for brass, whilst a cathode (trigger disc) erosion rate as high as 51. 23 x 10 - 6 cm 3 C- 1 for aluminum was measured. The lifetime of the TCS switch was experimentally determined {{for each of the}} electrode material tested, and was found to be inversely proportional to the erosion rate of the rod electrode. The electrode surface morphology and the gas-electrode compound distribution have also been evaluated to address the erosion mechanism in effect. Additionally, the influence of rod electrode surface conditions and gas deterioration has been investigated in respect to the performance and operational behavior of the TCS switch...|$|E

The electrical resistance and resistivity properties, for different grades of cast iron, were tested and measured at different temperatures- using bench scale set ups- and evaluated as a potential replacement for the existing HPGI due to the limitations of that material. These cast iron alloys include low-phosphorus gray iron, ductile irons with compositions typical for ferritic (FDI), pearlitic (PDI) ductile iron grades and three alloys with low phosphorous irons with different carbon equivalents. The thermal expansion for steel stub, HPGI, and for the succeeded cast iron alloy was measured using high precision automatic dilatometer and analyzed. Microstructures and mechanical properties of the selected alloy were tested and compared with the existing HPGI. The results shown that, the contact pressure, at steel stub-cast iron collar-anode connection, plays the major {{role in determining the}} electrical resistance and hence the voltage drop. Gray iron with carbon equivalent= 4. 5 has the lowest electrical resistivities compared with the other tested cast iron alloys, meanwhile carbides in the as-cast structures seem to be beneficial in increasing the thermal expansion and hence the contact pressure during the anode service life. The saving percent in voltage drop between gray iron with carbon equivalent = 4. 5 and HPGI reached to 18 %.

A closer examination reveals a complex behaviour of the steel stub- cast iron- carbon joint. It was shown in previous work [1] to be a non-linear thermal-electrical-mechanical coupled system. Minimisation of the stub-to-carbon voltage drop is a balancing act between contact surface area and electrical contact resistance.

40|$|A basic {{life cycle}} {{analysis}} {{was performed on the}} major extant secondary cell technologies (NiCd, NiMH, Li-ion, and lead acid) and environmental concerns were identified for all battery types. As such, an investigation was undertaken to innovate a more environmentally sustainable battery. The investigation focused on the zinc-air cell, currently used as a primary cell. After testing alternate electrodes and electrolyte concentrations, a standard cell configuration was developed using a zinc foil <b>anode,</b> graphite <b>rod</b> cathode, and 0. 5 M KOH electrolyte. To recharge the cell, the acid refreshment schema was proposed. In this schema, the ZnO coating that forms on the anode during discharge is dissolved in acid solution, exposing a fresh Zn surface for further discharge. The concept of acid refreshment was proved with HCI but the bulk of testing was done with acetic acid (CH 3 COOH). An assembly of 8 standard cells with two-pronged zinc anodes was tested. One Zn surface was "refreshing" while the other was discharging in the electrolyte at all times. The peak power output of the assembly was 18. 5 m W. Due to design flaws, significant capacity losses were observed with cell cycling; it is believed that these can be greatly reduced with minor redesigning...|$|R

Experimental tests were carried out on reinforced concrete specimens with 3 different kinds of commercial anodes that are used for ICCP in order for comparative study. Results have shown that the type of anodes is irrelevant to the effectiveness of cathodic protection. CP current similarly flowed to the anodes regardless of anode types in seawater condition. In addition, current was much higher in seawater condition than freshwater and air condition. The results show that titanium <b>rod</b> <b>anode</b> was slightly more effective in fresh water, and titanium mesh anode showed a better performance in atmospheric condition.

A seawater battery solves this problem. In this paper we report the results of performance tests on the Kongsberg Simrad seawater battery system SWB 600 carried out from beginning of Dec. 1998, in the Sea around Japan. This battery has a magnesium <b>rod</b> <b>anode,</b> and a cathode composed of a carbon fiber assembly. In performance tests, a set of nine parallel cement-resistors of 10 ohm was used.

40|$|The tube to {{tube sheet}} (TTS) welds of steam {{generator}} of Fast Breeder Reactor {{is the most}} critical joint. This is because, sodium flows on shell side and water on tube side. Any failure would thus be catastrophic. Microfocal radiography is an established technique {{that is being used}} for the evaluation of such welds. Using microfocal radiography pores of the order of 25 microns could be detected. Microfocal radiography of TTS joints is primarily accomplished using a backward throw <b>rod</b> <b>anode.</b> Such an arrangement however is beset with its own problems. The angled beam results in uneven beam intensity across the weld. During actual weld radiography, the trailing edge of the beam where intensity is minimum, traverses a longer distance than the leading edge which compounds the problem of density variation. This results in uneven radiographic density and contrast. It is a well-known fact that sensitivity achievable in radiography is a function of radiographic contrast and definition. Radiographic contrast in turn is affected by subject and film contrast. Uneven radiographic contrasts make interpretation complex and sometimes result in unacceptable density variations.
