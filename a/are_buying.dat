25|$|The {{popularity}} of the term fractional ownership has caused extensive rebranding in other industries where similar concepts, such as real estate timeshares, were already well established. The main distinction between timeshare and fractional ownership is that with a timeshare you buy {{the right to use}} a property, but with fractional ownership, you <b>are</b> <b>buying</b> real estate. You get a deeded piece of real estate, just not for the entire parcel.|$|E
25|$|One early {{example of}} {{inventory}} proportionality {{used in a}} retail application in the United States was for motor fuel. Motor fuel (e.g. gasoline) is generally stored in underground storage tanks. The motorists {{do not know whether}} they <b>are</b> <b>buying</b> gasoline off the top or bottom of the tank, nor need they care. Additionally, these storage tanks have a maximum capacity and cannot be overfilled. Finally, the product is expensive. Inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of motor fuel, each stored in dedicated tanks, in proportion to the sales of each grade. Excess inventory is not seen or valued by the consumer, so it is simply cash sunk (literally) into the ground. Inventory proportionality minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in underground storage tanks. This application for motor fuel was first developed and implemented by Petrolsoft Corporation in 1990 for Chevron Products Company. Most major oil companies use such systems today.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, 99p Stores {{replaced}} their Torex electronic {{point of}} sale system with one provided by Futura to operate their touchscreen Intelligent Registers (IRs). As well as allowing the retailer to understand which products customers <b>are</b> <b>buying,</b> through up-to-date tracking {{of the most popular}} products, it will also allow stock to be moved around the business quickly. Other functionality includes its allocation and replenishment capabilities, helping to ensure constant stock via automated ordering. Following a successful pilot (in which the company tested the new system in a select number of stores before committing to it), Futura scheduled an ambitious roll-out programme at the end of 2009 to change both software and platform, reducing the normal roll-out period from six months to two months. The Futura team installed the system with Digipos touch-screen tills each evening after trading, enabling the store to start trading the very next day. Simultaneously, new chip-and-pin capability is being introduced, to ensure the company is PCI compliant, with contactless payments to follow.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviewers were enthusiastic. Some {{lamented the}} use of poor white Southerners, and {{one-dimensional}} black victims, and Granville Hicks labeled the book [...] "melodramatic and contrived". When the book was first released, Southern writer Flannery O'Connor commented, [...] "I think for a child's book it does all right. It's interesting that all the folks that <b>are</b> <b>buying</b> it don't know they're reading a child's book. Somebody ought to say what it is." [...] Carson McCullers apparently agreed with the Time magazine review, writing to a cousin: [...] "Well, honey, one thing {{we know is that}} she's been poaching on my literary preserves." ...|$|E
500|$|Record labels earn {{as much as}} forty {{per cent}} of their annual sales during the festive season. Speaking in 2009, music {{retailer}} Geoff Bonouvrie remarked: [...] "The whole psychology of buying changes around Christmas. ... People's buying habits change. They <b>are</b> <b>buying</b> gifts for other people." [...] As a result of this, topping the album chart for 25 December is considered prestigious among the industry, as Christmas number one albums often sell in high quantities. Between 1986 and 2012, 23 of the 27 Christmas number one albums were featured {{in the top three}} of their respective year-end bestsellers chart.|$|E
500|$|As {{the release}} of the new album approached, the band and its {{management}} found {{that they would have to}} navigate changes in the music industry, which Hurley described as [...] "a completely different place." [...] Facing declining record sales, the lack of a proper outlet for exhibition of music videos, and the economic crisis, Hurley commented that [...] "people <b>are</b> <b>buying</b> things they need to survive rather than records and concert tickets." [...] The group's 2007 album Infinity on High sold one million copies, which was considered a disappointment compared to From Under the Cork Trees sales of three million. Trohman attributed this to [...] "the same reason that nobody's records are selling that well: there's so much turmoil in the music industry, so much downsizing, and people are finding different ways to get their music more and more all the time. There's very little we can do about that as a band. All we can do is try to make great music and hope it connects with people." ...|$|E

500|$|On October 15, Madonna threw a pre-release {{party at}} New York City's Industria Superstudio, and signed all the invitations under her Sex alter ego [...] "Dita". During the party, Madonna showed up dressed as Little Bo Peep and even carried {{with her a}} stuffed toy lamb. Madonna's {{publicist}} Liz Rosenberg showed concern at first due to [...] "what the parents of America's impressionable teens will soon be thinking" [...] but later said that it [...] "all depends on your idea of lovemaking, which in Madonna's case, should give {{new meaning to the}} word erotic". Both Waldenbooks and Barnes & Noble prepared corporate statements that the managers could share with customers who are offended by Sex. (Both statements defended the right of bookstores to provide [...] "diversity and choice" [...] to customers and say censorship is not the role of bookstores.) Many book stores, too, stated that the book would not be sold to anyone under 18 {{and that it would be}} for display only behind the cash register. Bookstore owner David Epstein stated that [...] "The feeling of most people who have ordered the book is that Madonna is something special, that this is cutting-edge art, , they're not the kind of people who <b>are</b> <b>buying</b> it because it's smut and dirty pictures. People are interested in it as art." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon the album's {{release in}} early April 1962 in both mono and stereo format, a {{reviewer}} for Billboard magazine claimed that [...] "In {{addition to being}} powerful dealer material, this package will fracture knowledgeable jockeys who will find in it a wealth of material to talk {{about as well as}} play." [...] By mid-April, reports of the album's sales and radio airplay had started coming in from cities such as Dallas and Philadelphia. On June 23, 1962, the mono issue of Modern Sounds replaced the West Side Story soundtrack album as the number one album in the United States, knocking it {{off the top of the}} Billboard Pop Albums chart. The album spawned four charting singles, [...] "Born to Lose", [...] "Careless Love", [...] "I Can't Stop Loving You" [...] and [...] "You Don't Know Me", the latter two of which went number one on the Adult Contemporary chart. The hit singles quickly gained a significant amount of radio airplay on both country and R stations. By mid-May, the album's lead single, [...] "I Can't Stop Loving You", had sold 700,000 copies within its first four weeks of release. Record dealers began describing the album as [...] "equal in sales action to some of the early Presley disks" [...] and, after moving 400,000 copies of the single, influential Atlanta record distributor Gwen Kestler told Billboard magazine that [...] "the record is so hot in her district that people who don't even own record players <b>are</b> <b>buying</b> it." [...] "I Can't Stop Loving You" [...] hit number one on the Billboard Pop Singles chart on June 2, spending five consecutive weeks at the top of the chart. By the time it fell off the top, the single was reported to have reached nearly a million and a half in sales, moving over 100,000 copies per week. In July the record spent two weeks at number one in Great Britain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{technique}} of inventory proportionality is {{most appropriate for}} inventories that remain unseen by the consumer, as opposed to [...] "keep full" [...] systems where a retail consumer {{would like to see}} full shelves of the product they <b>are</b> <b>buying</b> so as not to think they <b>are</b> <b>buying</b> something old, unwanted or stale; and differentiated from the [...] "trigger point" [...] systems where product is reordered when it hits a certain level; inventory proportionality is used effectively by just-in-time manufacturing processes and retail applications where the product is hidden from view.|$|E
