5|$|One {{person could}} say that 'Hero' is a schmaltzy piece of garbage, but another person can write to me a letter and say, 'I've {{considered}} committing suicide {{every day of my}} life for the last ten years until I heard that song, and I realized, after <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be my own hero,' and that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done something with my life, you know? It meant something to someone.|$|E
25|$|The {{execution}} {{by lethal}} injection began at 10:53pm EDT. In his final words, Davis maintained his innocence, saying:Well, first of all I'd like to address the MacPhail family. I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E
25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E

500|$|The comedian Jack Benny {{may have}} had an {{unbilled}} cameo role, as was claimed by a contemporary newspaper advertisement and in the Casablanca press book. When asked in his column [...] "Movie Answer Man", critic Roger Ebert first replied, [...] "It looks something like him. That's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say." [...] In a later column, he responded to a follow-up commenter, [...] "I think you're right. The Jack Benny Fan Club can feel vindicated." ...|$|E
500|$|Later that month, Rihanna tweeted: [...] "Just {{left the}} studio... Recorded a #monster hook {{for one of}} my {{favorite}} artists!

In response, Urlacher has stated [...] "Just watch the film.

500|$|Jenna Fischer enjoyed {{doing her}} {{individual}} scenes with Rainn Wilson because their characters rarely interacted one-on-one. The filming of these scenes {{took place on}} the last days of production for the season, and not many people were still on set. The episode finished shooting in April 2007. Two weeks before the finale, actor Oscar Nunez gave brief allusions in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "There will be some movement. Major things moving. Major shifts that affect the entire office. So there's some good stuff coming up. That's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say." ...|$|E
500|$|The song created {{controversy}} over the writing credits. Steve Wallace, an Indiana songwriter, claimed he wrote [...] "Sometimes" [...] in 1990, but didn't copyright it until 2003, four years after Spears registered the song's copyright. Wallace claimed Spears confessed he wrote the song, by showing to the court a possible e-mail from the singer, which said, [...] "I now {{know for a fact}} that you wrote [...] But there's nothing I can do about it. That's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say about it." [...] The e-mail was considered fake and the lawsuit was dismissed on October 31, 2005, when Judge John D. Tinder claimed the singer didn't steal the song.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] he said, rising with difficulty, [...] "I {{have said}} <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have to say, and done <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do. <b>I</b> shall still {{hope that you}} may change your mind. I shall not yet abandon hope. Good-bye." ...|$|R

Willkie saw the damage Nazi bombing had inflicted on Britain, visiting bombed-out sites in London, Birmingham, Coventry, Manchester and Liverpool. In London during the Blitz, he walked the streets at night without helmet or gas mask (until Churchill gave him some), visiting bomb shelters. Churchill hosted Willkie at an official luncheon at 10 Downing Street and had him as a guest at Chequers. In his writings, Churchill recalled [...] "a long talk with this most able and forceful man".|$|E
500|$|At his {{confirmation}} hearings in 2017, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch recalled being moved by reading Sumner's gravestone {{as a law}} student at Harvard. Gorsuch closed his opening statement by reading a portion of Sumner's epitaph and adding [...] "hose words stick with me. I keep them on my desk. They serve {{for me as a}} daily reminder of the law's integrity, that a useful life can be led in its service, of the hard work it takes, and an encouragement to good habits when I fail and when I falter. At the end of it <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> ask for nothing more than to be described as he was. And if confirmed, I pledge to you that I will do everything in my power to be that man." ...|$|E
500|$|The Boston Herald noted {{superficial}} {{similarities between}} System Shock and Doom, but called System Shock [...] "much more elaborate". The reviewer noted its high system requirements and complex controls; of the latter, he said, [...] "There's {{no way you}} can play System Shock without first studying the manual for at least 20 minutes". The paper believed that the game would [...] "set a new standard for computer games with its combination of action and puzzle-solving". The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said that the game [...] "is like a well-prepared hamburger—familiar stuff, but good to the last byte". The reviewer noted the game's [...] "somewhat clumsy control", but said, [...] "That, however, is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find to complain about. Graphics and sound are outstanding, and the game is well-paced and riveting".|$|E

500|$|During a {{performance}} at a May 2004 Blue Jays-Rangers game in Toronto, Hung {{revealed that he}} would begin work on a second album. He said that it [...] "will include original songs and cover songs... There will be more bands this time. That's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell you." [...] Hung also {{announced that he was}} taking singing lessons before starting the recording sessions. When interviewed by MTV News in June 2004, he said that recording was [...] "gonna be a much slower process than the first time. Right now I'm concentrating on just picking songs... starting to practice them and things like that." [...] Producers submitted the songs to Koch Records, and Hung said in the interview that the label had [...] "some ideas and stuff, and we'll see. It's still early — very, very early." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the same publication, Ne-Yo explained how he wrote the lyrics, [...] "I'm listening to the track, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see is Rihanna and some random person sitting across from each other at the table with a gun sitting {{in the middle of the}} table and playing Russian roulette." [...] Ne-Yo further stated that Rihanna is not afraid to trying new things and from the first moment she heard the song he knew she would like it, [...] "I trust Rihanna to be Rihanna, and she trusts me to be me. That's the coolest thing about our relationship. I must say this song is a step in somewhat of a different direction for both of us." [...] When Harmony heard the song, both he and Ne-Yo were aware that they should change some elements and that it had to be darker and edgier.|$|E
500|$|.....of [...] that I have read, the {{negative}} ones often {{say something to}} the effect that the book is just like the game, so why read it? What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell you is that the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E

500|$|Near the novel's conclusion, Judd {{refuses to}} honor his {{agreement}} with Marty {{because there was no}} witness. When Marty asks his mother what a witness is, she responds: [...] "Somebody who knows the Lord Jesus and don't mind tellin' about it." [...] Despite Judd's refusal to honor the agreement, Marty persistently maintains his part of it. He decides: [...] "I got no choice. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do is stick to my side of the deal and see what happens. All in the world I can do." [...] After ultimately ceding Shiloh to Marty, Judd asks: [...] "What {{you going to do with}} that dog once he's yours?" [...] Marty's simple reply is: [...] "Love him." [...] Scholar Claudia Mills noted that: [...] "The resolution of the stand-off comes when Marty, in essence, stands witness, in his mother's religious sense of witness, for an ethic of love, crystallized in his love for Shiloh." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're {{just going to have to}} go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E
500|$|He spent £300,000 on midfielder Chris Birchall for {{the start}} of the 2006–07 season. His team started well, however midway through the campaign, {{following}} a run of five games without defeat, Coventry suddenly and unexpectedly hit a bad run of form. A 5–0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion began a sequence of eight games without a win, including six defeats. This culminated in a 2–0 home defeat to Bristol City in the FA Cup, a game which also saw a record low attendance at the Ricoh Arena. On 17 January 2007, the day after the cup exit, the club parted company with Adams, with Coventry lying 16th in the Championship. Adams stated that he intended to return to management as soon as possible. He admitted that the sale of Gary McSheffrey to Birmingham City had been a turning point in the club's season, but also said that [...] "I genuinely believe that I could have turned it around" [...] and [...] "I tried my best and that's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do." ...|$|E
