5|$|Females {{have two}} {{openings}} located under {{the edge of}} the mantle in the mantle cavity: the opening of the vagina and <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>for</b> laying eggs. The vagina accepts the sperm during copulation. The vagina is connected to the bursa copulatrix and to the spermatheca (for storing sperm). The other opening is for laying eggs. Egg cells originate in the ovary. Egg cells travel through the oviduct to the fertilization chamber, where fertilization occur. Eggs then develop in the glandular uterus. A capsule is formed in the diverticulum next to the uterus. The eggs are then laid.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} from his unsuccessful mission to Japan, Nuyts {{took up his}} position as the third Governor of Formosa, with his residence in Fort Zeelandia in Tayouan (modern-day Anping). One of his early aims was to force <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>for</b> the Dutch to trade in China — something which had eluded them since they arrived in East Asia in the early 17th century. To further this goal, he took the Chinese trade negotiator Zheng Zhilong hostage and refused to release him until he agreed to give the Dutch trading privileges. More than thirty years later {{it was to be}} Zheng's son Koxinga who ended the reign of the Dutch on Formosa.|$|E
5|$|After the Boss rescues Kinzie {{from her}} nightmare, she devises {{a plan to}} crash the simulation, which will force the Zin to draw power from their ship to keep it running, thus {{weakening}} the ship itself and creating <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>for</b> the Saints to enter. Working together, the remaining Saints manage to overload the simulation, shutting it down just as the Boss escapes. Assaulting Zinyak's ship, the Boss finds power armor emulating the powers {{they had in the}} simulation, and confronts Zinyak in his throne room. While the entire Zin Empire watches, Zinyak and the Boss battle each other. With help from the Saints, the Boss kills Zinyak by tearing his head off and emerges victorious. Impressed, the Zin forces surrender to the Boss, who becomes the new head of the Zin Empire.|$|E

25|$|In its {{earliest}} days the intelligent design movement {{was called the}} 'wedge movement'. The wedge metaphor, attributed to Johnson, {{is that of a}} metal wedge splitting a log and represents using an aggressive public relations programme to create <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>for</b> the supernatural in the public's understanding of science. Johnson acknowledges that the goal of the intelligent design movement is to promote a theistic agenda as a scientific concept.|$|E

25|$|Herbert von Karajan {{introduced}} {{the practice of}} performing operas exclusively in their original language instead of being translated into German. He also strengthened the ensemble and regular principal singers and {{introduced the}} policy of predominantly engaging guest singers. He began a collaboration with La Scala in Milan, in which both productions and orchestrations were shared. This created <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>for</b> the prominent members of the Viennese ensemble to appear in Milan, especially to perform works by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Richard Strauss.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{loose-fitting}} tunic, generally {{made from}} {{two or three}} rectangular pieces of fabric which are then joined together with stitching, ribbons or fabric strips, with <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>for</b> the head and, if the sides are sewn, openings for the arms. Traditional huipils, especially ceremonial ones, are usually made with fabric woven on a backstrap loom and are heavily decorated with designs woven into the fabric, embroidery, ribbons, lace and more. However, some huipils are also made from commercial fabric.|$|E
25|$|The Leatherman spent {{each night}} in a {{different}} 'cave' on his route where he had usually left a supply of firewood and tinder to start a fire soon after he arrived. The fire's heat would warm the stone sides of the 'cave' {{and allow it to}} stay warm throughout the night. Most of the cave's provided <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>for</b> the fire's smoke to exit while still providing shelter from cold wind and rain. The Leatherman would accept food and drink (and occasional lodging and/or treatment when ill) from concerned charitable citizens along the route.|$|E

25|$|The gulf-style or full niqab {{completely}} {{covers the}} face. It {{consists of an}} upper band that is tied around the forehead, together with a long wide piece of fabric which covers the face, leaving <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>for</b> the eyes. Many full niqab have two or more sheer layers attached to the upper band, which can be worn flipped down to cover the eyes or left {{over the top of}} the head. While a person looking at a woman wearing a niqab with an eyeveil would not be able to see her eyes, the woman wearing the niqab would be able to see out through the thin fabric.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} {{appearance}} as komusubi in the September tournament, Baruto managed an 8–7 score, while having a less than perfect start to the tournament. He was just 2–7 after 9 bouts where he competed with only the titled ranks of san'yaku wrestlers. His last six matches were against wrestlers from the maegashira ranks and there Baruto managed to hold his ground. He was promoted to sekiwake rank for the Kyushu Basho in November, as the west sekiwake Toyonoshima could not hold his position after a 6–9 finish in the Aki Basho, thus leaving <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>for</b> the position. He came through with a winning record in his sekiwake debut.|$|E
25|$|No kill {{or limited}} admit shelter are many times filled to {{capacity}} along with their partners. In these instances they will request that the owner hold the animal until there is an opening. Their names are then placed on a list to be called when a space is available. If a shelter is working with other shelters taking in their overflow, it may be quite awhile before there is <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>for</b> an owners pet. Many of these come from {{other regions of the}} country where there is an abundance of pets or more readily adoptable ones in other areas such as puppies or kittens.|$|E

25|$|The ecdysial suture {{is made of}} the coronal, frontal, and epicranial sutures {{plus the}} ecdysial and {{cleavage}} lines, which vary among different species of insects. The ecdysial suture is longitudinally placed on the vertex and separates the epicranial halves of the head {{to the left and}} right sides. Depending on the insect, the suture may come in different shapes: like either a Y, U, or V. Those diverging lines that make up the ecdysial suture are called the frontal or frontogenal sutures. Not all species of insects have frontal sutures, but in those that do, the sutures split open during ecdysis, which helps provide <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>for</b> the new instar to emerge from the integument.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{openings}} {{through the}} head of Bothriolepis: a keyhole opening along the midline on the upper side for the eyes and nostrils and <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>for</b> the mouth on the lower side near the anterior end of the head. A discovery regarding preserved structures {{that appear to be}} nasal capsules confirms the belief that the external nasal openings lay on the dorsal side of the head near the eyes. Additionally, the position of the mouth on the ventral side of the skull is consistent with the typical horizontal resting orientation of Bothriolepis. It had a special feature on its skull, a separate partition of bone below the opening for the eyes and nostrils enclosing the nasal capsules called a preorbital recess.|$|E
25|$|Other common {{styles of}} {{clothing}} popularly worn with a niqab in Western countries include the khimar, a semi-circular flare of fabric with <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>for</b> {{the face and}} a small triangular underscarf. A khimar is usually bust-level or longer, and can also be worn without the niqab. It is considered a fairly easy form of headscarf to wear, as there are no pins or fasteners; it is simply pulled over the head. Gloves are also sometimes worn with the niqab, because many munaqqabāt believe {{no part of the}} skin should be visible other than the area immediately around the eyes or because {{they do not want to}} be put in a position where they would touch the hand of an unrelated man (for instance, when accepting change from a cashier). Most munaqqabāt also wear an overgarment (jilbab, abaya etc.) over their clothing, though some munaqabat in Western countries wear a long, loose tunic and skirt instead of a one-piece overgarment.|$|E
