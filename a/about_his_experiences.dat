His son, Daniel, was born with severe autism; he has lived {{most of his life}} at the Allegheny Valley School, an {{institution}} specializing in intellectual developmental disabilities.

5|$|Ellis {{fought for}} players' rights, {{including}} the right to free agency. Jackie Robinson credited him with trying to further the rights of African American players, but warned him that he said too much. In 1971, Ellis testified before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Public Health <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>experiences</b> with sickle cell and later worked with people who had the disease and raised money for sickle cell research.|$|E

5|$|For his {{services}} in Iran, Savige was also mentioned in despatches a third time. He later {{wrote a book}} <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>experiences,</b> entitled Stalky's Forlorn Hope, {{which was published in}} Melbourne in 1920. In November 1918, he was evacuated to a hospital in Bombay, suffering an attack of malaria, and returned to Australia in January 1919 on the City of Exeter.|$|E
5|$|Hardy often {{acted as}} a scout who would help bring {{supplies}} to troops on the front line. On September 25, 1918, he {{was present at the}} Meuse River during a mustard gas attack and, {{at some point during the}} war, he received an injury to his knee. Hardy rarely spoke about the fighting itself, and preferred to talk about France's weather when asked <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>experiences</b> overseas.|$|E

5|$|Thomas David Jones was {{a member}} of the United States Air Force prior to working for NASA. As Jones was a United States federal {{employee}} at the time of the book's publication, he did not receive profits from sales of the work. English and Jones later produced another collaborative work, Scholastic Encyclopedia of the United States at War, which was published in 1998. Jones wrote another book <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>experiences</b> in space, Sky Walking: An Astronaut's Memoir, which was published in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Wacław Gluth-Nowowiejski, {{a member}} of the Home Army who was wounded during the {{uprising}} and barely managed to escape the Wehrmacht's Marymont massacre of civilians and wounded soldiers, hid {{in the basement of a}} destroyed house from mid-September until mid-November. Gluth-Nowowiejski wrote several books <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>experiences</b> after the war, including Rzeczpospolita Gruzów ("The Commonwealth of Ruins") and Stolica jaskiń: z pamięci warszawskiego Robinsona ("The capital of caves: memoirs of a Warsaw Robinson").|$|E

5|$|After {{his release}} from prison, Berkman served as editor of Goldman's anarchist journal, Mother Earth, and later {{established}} his own journal, The Blast. In 1917, Berkman and Goldman were sentenced {{to two years in}} jail for conspiracy against the newly instated draft. After their release from prison, they were arrested—along with hundreds of others—and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of that country's Bolshevik revolution, Berkman and Goldman soon became disillusioned, voicing their opposition to the Soviet's use of terror after seizing power and their repression of fellow revolutionaries. In 1925, he published a book <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>experiences,</b> The Bolshevik Myth.|$|E
5|$|Blitz {{conceived}} a rough storyline for {{the film}} while making Spellbound, a documentary about 1999's Scripps National Spelling Bee, but an HBO Films executive persuaded him to write the film based on his own adolescence {{when he told her}} <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>experiences</b> as a stutterer. The film's producers visited several cities in the United States and Canada; Thompson was cast based on a tape which his agent had sent and a follow-up audition after the first actor cast in the lead was forced to pull out. The film was shot over 30 days in Baltimore, Maryland and Trenton, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Dugan {{made his}} first sound effects {{recordings}} to augment his theatrical sound designs. As he grew more interested in field recording, he was attracted to the sounds found in pristine natural settings—environments without human noise. A board member and webmaster of Nature Sounds Society, Dugan has conducted equipment training sessions since 1994, and has given talks <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>experiences</b> in nature recording. He has traveled to New Zealand in pursuit of recordings, but mainly devotes himself to U.S. National Parks and Monuments such as Yosemite and Muir Woods. Other national parks and monuments at which he has recorded sound include Joshua Tree, Pinnacles, Lassen Volcanic, Yellowstone, Haleakala, Olympic, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Kings Canyon, Sequoia and Lava Beds.|$|E

5|$|In March 1915, {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Savige enlisted in the First Australian Imperial Force. He served in the ranks during the Gallipoli Campaign, and received a commission. He later served on the Western Front, where he was twice recommended for the Military Cross for bravery. In 1918, he joined Dunsterforce and served in the Caucasus Campaign, during which he was instrumental in protecting thousands of Assyrian refugees. He subsequently wrote a book, Stalky's Forlorn Hope, <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>experiences.</b> After the war he {{played a key role in}} the establishment of Legacy Australia, the war widows and orphans benefit fund.|$|E
5|$|In early 1941 the British press, with {{permission}} from the Air Ministry, was allowed to approach Cunningham and write <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>experiences.</b> One of the motivating reasons {{for the lack of}} censorship was morale. In {{the early stages of the}} Blitz, the perception among the civilian population was that the Germans could attack at will over Britain during the night. The publication of Cunningham's exploits were an attempt to assure the public the RAF was fighting back and imposing losses upon the Luftwaffe. Cunningham was singled out for attention for this purpose, though Rawnsley's contribution to his success was virtually ignored.|$|E
5|$|On 11 November 1929, Maxwell {{attended}} the New South Wales Dinner for {{recipients of the}} Victoria Cross in Sydney, and 1932 saw the publication of Hell's Bells and Mademoiselles, a book written in collaboration with Hugh Buggy <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>experiences</b> in the war. At the time, Maxwell {{was working as a}} gardener with the Department of the Interior in Canberra. The book was a success, but Maxwell soon spent what money he made from it. In the late 1930s, he wrote the manuscript for a second book entitled From the Hindenburg Line to the Breadline. The book was never published and the manuscript was lost when it was lent to someone to read.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his life, Crean {{remained}} an extremely modest man. When {{he returned to}} Kerry, he put all of his medals away and never again spoke <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>experiences</b> in the Antarctic. Indeed, there is no reliable evidence of Crean giving any interviews to the press. It has been speculated that {{this may have been}} because Kerry was a hotbed of Irish nationalism and later Irish republicanism, and, along with County Cork, an epicentre of violence. The Crean family were once subject to a Black and Tan raid during the Irish War of Independence. Their inn was ransacked until the raiders happened across Crean's framed photo in Royal Navy dress uniform and medals. They then left his inn.|$|E
5|$|Wiesel was 16 when Buchenwald was liberated by the United States Army in April 1945, {{too late}} for his father, who died after a beating while Wiesel lay silently on the bunk above {{for fear of being}} beaten too. He moved to Paris after the war and in 1954 {{completed}} an 862-page manuscript in Yiddish <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>experiences,</b> published in Argentina as the 245-page Un di velt hot geshvign ("And the World Remained Silent"). The novelist François Mauriac helped him find a French publisher. Les Éditions de Minuit published 178 pages as La Nuit in 1958, and in 1960 Hill & Wang in New York published a 116-page translation as Night.|$|E
5|$|Galland, who {{was born}} in Westerholt, Westphalia became a glider pilot in 1929 before he joined Lufthansa. In 1932, he {{graduated}} as a pilot at the Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule (German Commercial Flyers' School) in Braunschweig before applying to join the Reichswehr of the Weimar Republic later in the year. Galland's application was accepted, but he never took up the offer. In February 1934, he was transferred to the Luftwaffe. In 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, he volunteered for the Condor Legion and flew ground attack missions in support of the Nationalists under Francisco Franco. After finishing his tour in 1938 Galland was employed in the Air Ministry writing doctrinal and technical manuals <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>experiences</b> as a ground-attack pilot. During this period Galland served as an instructor for ground-attack units. During the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, he again flew ground attack missions. In early 1940 Galland managed to persuade his superiors to allow him to become a fighter pilot.|$|E
