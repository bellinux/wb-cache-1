50|$|An {{implication}} of indirect fire and improving guns was increasing range between gun and target, this increased {{the time of}} flight and the vertex of the trajectory. The result was decreasing accuracy (the increasing distance between the target and the {{mean point of impact}} of the shells aimed at it) caused by the increasing effects of non-standard conditions. Indirect firing data was based on standard conditions including a specific muzzle velocity, zero wind, air temperature and density, and propellant temperature. In practice, this standard combination of conditions almost never existed, they varied throughout the day and day to day, and the greater the time of flight, the greater the inaccuracy. An added complication was the need for survey to accurately fix the coordinates of the gun position and provide <b>accurate</b> <b>orientation</b> for the guns. Of course, targets had to be accurately located, but by 1916, air photo interpretation techniques enabled this, and ground survey techniques could sometimes be used.|$|E

The Infra-red laser beam is used to determine the distance to fingers and thumbs to obtain the <b>accurate</b> <b>orientation</b> of the hands.

40|$|Image-based mobile mapping systems enable an {{efficient}} acquisition of georeferenced image sequences, {{which can be}} used for geo-data capture in subsequent steps. In order to provide accurate measurements in a given reference frame while e. g. aiming at high fidelity 3 D urban models, high quality georeferencing of the captured multi-view image sequences is required. Moreover, sub-pixel <b>accurate</b> <b>orientations</b> of these highly redundant image sequences are needed in order to optimally perform steps like dense multi-image matching as a prerequisite for 3 D point cloud and mesh generation. While direct georeferencing of image-based mobile mapping data performs well in open areas, poor GNSS coverage in urban canyons aggravates fulfilling these high accuracy requirements, even with high-grade inertial navigation equipment. Hence, we conducted comprehensive investigations aiming at assessing the quality of directly georeferenced sensor orientations as well as the expected improvement by image-based georeferencing in a challenging urban environment. Our study repeatedly delivered mean trajectory deviations of up to 80 cm. By performing image-based georeferencing using bundle adjustment for a limited set of cameras and a limited number of ground control points, mean check point residuals could be lowered from approx. 40 cm to 4 cm. Furthermore, we showed that largely automated image-based georeferencing is capable of detecting and compensating discontinuities in directly georeferenced trajectories...|$|R
