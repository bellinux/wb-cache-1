There they met with Martić, RSK prime minister Borislav Mikelić and foreign minister Milan Babić. Martić refused to receive the draft before the UN Security Council issued a written statement extending the UNPROFOR mandate to protect the RSK. Kerestedjiants and Ahrens suggested that Martić should <b>acknowledge</b> <b>receipt</b> of the plan and then say that the RSK would not negotiate before the UNPROFOR issue was resolved, but he refused. The diplomats then attempted to meet Milošević in Belgrade about the matter, but Milošević refused to see them and the group returned to Zagreb the next day. Ahrens described the events of 30 January as [...] "a fiasco".|$|E
2500|$|Trigger (with new skipper Commander David R. Connole) {{stood out}} to sea on 11 March to begin her 12th war patrol {{and headed for the}} Nansei Shoto area. On 18 March, she {{attacked}} a convoy west of the islands, sinking the cargo ship Tsukushi Maru No.3 and damaging another. She reported the attack on 20 March, and the submarine was subsequently ordered to radio as many movements of the convoy as possible to help find a safe passage through a known mined area of the East China Sea. On 24 March, Trigger was ordered to begin patrolling west of the islands the next day, outside the 100fathom curve, and to steer clear of restricted areas. On 26 March, she was ordered to join a wolf pack called [...] "Earl's Eliminators" [...] and to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>receipt</b> of the message. A weather report came from the submarine that day but no confirmation of her having received the message. The weather report was Triggers last transmission. On 4 April, she was ordered to proceed to Midway, but she had not arrived by 1 May and was reported as presumed lost.|$|E
2500|$|I {{have also}} to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>receipt</b> {{of a letter}} from Mr. H.E. Holmes of Durban, {{enclosing}} the text of a pronouncement made by the South African Board of Control to the effect that, {{in the opinion of}} that body, the contest between the MCC team and The Reef at Vogelfontein on 22 and 23 December 1909, was not a first-class match. In the course of this encounter Hobbs scored 70 runs which are counted in his first-class aggregate. Seeing that the game was regarded, {{at the time it was}} played, as first-class and until a little while ago had been left in undisputed possession of that rank, the need for raising any question about the matter after more than twenty years is not at all obvious. In any circumstances, I should not advise the dragging up of what, with all due respect to the recent ruling of the South African Board, must remain a debatable matter. The Reef team included some Test match players and others who had appeared in Inter-State games so it certainly had considerable claims to be regarded as first-class and from that standing, I cannot, all things considered, agree after such a long lapse of time to reduce it. Outside the merits of the case, is there not something rather grotesque in the idea of a controlling body sitting in solemn conclave over so small a matter and deciding to upset what had been accepted for twenty years? ...|$|E
