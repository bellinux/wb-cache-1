50|$|In {{response}} to the Berlin Crisis of August 1961, Tweedy was recommissioned on 2 October of that year. Following refresher training, she was assigned the home port of Newport, Rhode Island, and commenced <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>barrier</b> duties in the Caribbean early in 1962. Throughout the year, she engaged in fleet and type exercises, made goodwill visits, and served as flagship for Escort Squadron 12. On 12 June, as Tweedy steamed from Pensacola to Norfolk, Virginia, she came upon nine Cuban nationals in distress after two days at sea in an open, 14-foot boat. Tweedy aided the refugees and, later in the day, transferred them to U.S. Coast Guard representatives for assistance {{on their way to}} Miami.|$|E
5000|$|... == World War II North Atlantic operations== After fitting out, Sutton sailed on 12 January 1945 for the Bermuda {{operating}} area {{and held her}} shakedown there until she headed for Boston, Massachusetts, on 14 February. After yard work at the Boston Navy Yard and training at Casco Bay, Maine, she was assigned to Escort Division (CortDiv) 79 which was attached to Task Group (TG) 22.13 and sailed for Argentia, Newfoundland, on 1 March. The group conducted anti-submarine patrols off Newfoundland from 4 to 22 March when it returned to Casco Bay. Sutton stood out of Casco Bay, on 3 April, with her task group which took station on the North-South <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>barrier</b> patrol.|$|E
5000|$|Under Belknaps command, Mine Squadron One {{deployed}} to its bases in Scotland at Inverness and Invergordon in May 1918. He personally commanded {{the activities of}} the squadron during its first foray into the North Sea on 2 June 1918, beginning the first offensive mining campaign {{in the history of the}} U.S. Navy and one of the largest U.S. Navy contributions to the Allied naval effort during the war. He commanded the squadron on nine more excursions, the last of them in the last week of October 1918, by which time it had laid 56,611 Mark 6 [...] "antenna" [...] mines in 13 groups, with each group consisting of rows of mines 134 nautical miles (248 km) across set at three preset depths of between 10 feet (3 meters) and 260 feet (79 meters), covering an area of 6,000 square miles. The British Royal Navy also contributed, laying 16,652 additional mines along the flanks of the American minefield. The war ended on 11 November 1918 before Mine Squadron One could finish a complete <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>barrier,</b> but the Barrage nonetheless is credited with sinking at least three German submarines and perhaps three more, as well as damaging three or four others. It also had a large psychological effect on German submarine crews, one of which mutinied when ordered to pass through the Barrage.|$|E
