2500|$|A limit {{case has}} been reached in Bolivia, with {{anaerobic}} digestion in temperature working conditions of less than 10°C. The anaerobic process is very slow, taking {{more than three times}} the normal mesophilic time process. In experimental work at University of Alaska Fairbanks, a 1,000 litre digester using psychrophiles harvested from [...] "mud from a frozen lake in Alaska" [...] has produced 200–300litres of methane per day, about 20 to 30% of the output from digesters in warmer climates. Mesophilic species outnumber thermophiles, and they are also more tolerant to changes in environmental conditions than thermophiles. Mesophilic systems are, therefore, considered to be more stable than thermophilic digestion systems. In contrast, while thermophilic digestion systems are considered less stable, their energy input is higher, with more biogas being removed from the organic matter in an equal amount of time. The increased temperatures facilitate faster reaction rates, and thus faster gas yields. Operation at higher temperatures facilitates greater pathogen reduction of the digestate. In countries where legislation, such as the <b>Animal</b> <b>By-Products</b> Regulations in the European Union, requires digestate to meet certain levels of pathogen reduction there may be a benefit to using thermophilic temperatures instead of mesophilic.|$|E

40|$|Hypertension or {{high blood}} {{pressure}} is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, which are {{the leading cause of}} death in the Western world. Next to lifestyle modifications, including smoke cessation, exercise, stress management and a healthy diet, functional foods containing angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) -inhibitory peptides can play a role in the prevention of hypertension. ACE (EC 3. 4. 15. 1) plays a key role in different blood pressure-regulating mechanisms, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron-system (RAAS) and the kallikrein-kinin-system (KKS), where its action results in an overall increase in blood pressure. Thus, peptides or protein hydrolysates with ACE-inhibitory activity have a blood pressure-lowering effect. In this project, the potential of different protein hydrolysates for the development of an antihypertensive functional food was investigated. Two main sections can be distinguished, the ACE-inhibitory and antihypertensive activity of gelatin hydrolysates was evaluated on the one hand, and a peptic hydrolysate of an <b>animal</b> <b>by-product</b> and its derivatives were investigated for blood pressure-lowering properties on the other hand. In each section, antihypertensive activity was confirmed at three levels: in vitro, in vivo and in organ baths, and finally, bio-active peptides were identified.

Potato peel, grass clippings and rice husks were the starting organic materials considered. The incorporation of 30 % (w/w) ES in a composting mixture did not affect mixture biodegradability, nor its capacity to reach sanitizing temperatures. After 25 days of composting, ES addition caused a nitrogen loss of about 10 g N kg− 1 of initial volatile solids, thus reducing nitrogen nutritional potential of the finished compost.
