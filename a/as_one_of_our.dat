Anderson once called it [...] "possibly the worst film ever made", while Elliott considers it [...] "awful". Cohen and Levy were similarly unimpressed and offered Anderson no further commissions for Anglo-Amalgamated. During the promotional campaign for Thunderbirds Are Go, made by AP Films' successor company Century 21 and released in 1966, Sylvia Anderson said of the earlier film, [...] "The less said about it, the better"; she has since commented that it [...] "hardly ranks <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> best efforts". A contemporary review in Monthly Film Bulletin was more positive: [...] "Quick off the mark, this modest little thriller soon settles down into a routine 'cops and robbers' format, efficient if not always too convincing." [...] Stronger praise came in the October 1960 issue of Kine Weekly, which commended Crossroads to Crime as being [...] "refreshingly free from pretence", adding: [...] "The film's moral is lofty, its tender domestic asides encourage feminine interest, and the climax is a corker." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Anonymous Conqueror wrote, They {{lead him}} to the temple, where they dance and carry on joyously, and the man about to be {{sacrifice}}d dances and carries on like the rest.

Soon comes the sacrificing priest--and this is no small office among them--armed with a stone knife, which cuts like steel, and is as big <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> large knives. He plunges the knife into the breast, opens it, and tears out the heart hot and palpitating. And this as quickly as one might cross himself.

Then he anoints the mouths of all the other idols of wood and stone, and sprinkles blood on the cornice of the chapel of the principal idol. Afterwards they burn the heart, preserving the ashes as a great relic, and likewise they burn the body of the sacrifice, but these ashes are kept apart from those of the heart in a different vase.|$|E
