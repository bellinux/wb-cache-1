5|$|The Egyptologist Wilfried Seipel has {{proposed}} that this pyramid was initially intended for queen Meresankh IV, whom he and Verner see as <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> of Djedkare.

Alternatively, Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton have proposed that she was <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> of the preceding king, Menkauhor Kaiu.|$|E
40|$|In this study, I {{examine the}} {{allocation}} mechanism within families {{by using the}} collective model. The empirical results suggest that <b>a</b> <b>wife's</b> income proportion affects her budget proportion. This connection exists for food and shows that <b>a</b> <b>wife's</b> income proportion is positively correlated with her preferred share of the food budget but is negatively correlated with a husband's preferred share of the food budget. I also explored the changes in <b>a</b> <b>wife's</b> income proportion and budget proportion between 1989 and 2004 {{and found that the}} correlation between the two became larger, suggesting that <b>a</b> <b>wife's</b> distribution power strengthened during this period...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>wife</b> of <b>a</b> {{substantive}} peer {{is legally}} {{entitled to the}} privileges of peerage: {{she is said to}} have a [...] "life estate" [...] in her husband's dignity. Thus <b>a</b> duke's <b>wife</b> is titled <b>a</b> [...] "duchess", <b>a</b> marquess's <b>wife</b> <b>a</b> [...] "marchioness", <b>an</b> earl's <b>wife</b> <b>a</b> [...] "countess", <b>a</b> viscount's <b>wife</b> <b>a</b> [...] "viscountess" [...] and <b>a</b> baron's <b>wife</b> <b>a</b> [...] "baroness". Despite being referred to as a [...] "peeress", she is not a peer in her own right: this is a 'style' and not a substantive title. However, this is considered a legal title, unlike the social titles of a peer's children.|$|R
5000|$|By the Victorian era, {{the concept}} of [...] "pater familias", meaning the husband {{as head of the}} {{household}} and moral leader of his family, was firmly entrenched in British culture. <b>A</b> <b>wife's</b> proper role was to love, honour and obey her husband, as her marriage vows stated. <b>A</b> <b>wife's</b> place in the family hierarchy was secondary to her husband, but far from being considered unimportant, <b>a</b> <b>wife's</b> duties to tend to her husband and properly raise her children were considered crucial cornerstones of social stability by the Victorians.|$|R

If <b>an</b> older <b>wife</b> objected to her husbands taking multiple wives, she was beaten for her defiance.

5|$|Although Maitreyi {{of ancient}} India, {{described}} as an Advaita philosopher, {{is said to be}} <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> of the sage Yajnavalkya in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad in the time of Janaka, the Hindu epic Mahabharata states Sulabha Maitreyi is a young beauty who never marries. In the latter, Maitreyi explains Advaita philosophy (monism) to Janaka and is described as a lifelong ascetic. She is called as a brahmavadini (a female expounder of the Veda) in ancient Sanskrit literature. Maitreyi and Yajnavalkya are estimated to have lived around the 8th century BCE.|$|E

In 1960, despite a strong recommendation from Albert Martin Sacks, a professor and later dean of Harvard Law School, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter rejected Ginsburg for a clerkship position due to her gender. Later that year, Ginsburg began a clerkship for Judge Edmund L. Palmieri of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, a position she held for two years.|$|E

Tärnström's widow blamed Linnaeus for making her children fatherless, causing Linnaeus to prefer sending out younger, unmarried students after Tärnström. Six other apostles later died on their expeditions, including Pehr Forsskål and Pehr Löfling.|$|E
