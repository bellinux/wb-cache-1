5|$|Then for {{the next}} week or two Mariah would call me and say, 'What {{do you think about this}} bit?' We would talk a little bit until she got the lyrics all nicely coordinated and done. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> just waited until the {{sessions}} began, which were in the summer of '94 where we got together in New York and started recording. And that's when we first hear her at the microphone singing, and the rest is history.|$|E
5|$|They {{made all}} these {{different}} bits up, not {{thinking in terms of}} verse, chorus, bridge or what was going to go where, just coming up with all these sections of chanting, rapping and singing, which we recorded all higgledy-piggledy. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> just sewed it together. It was rather like the way we'd been working on the dance remixes we'd been doing before. Kind of a cut-and-paste method.|$|E
5|$|Oscar's {{viewpoint}} {{rises and}} looks at his body from above, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> begin to witness {{his life in a}} roughly chronological order. His loving parents were killed in a violent car crash; Oscar and Linda, devoted to each other, were sent to different foster homes; Oscar moved to Tokyo and earned money through drug dealing until he could afford to bring Linda to live with him; Oscar sleeps with his friend Victor's mother in return for extra money to help bring his sister over; Linda found work as a stripper for the nightclub owner Mario, to Oscar's distress; Oscar increased the scope of his dealing operations and started using potent psychedelics—in particular, DMT—more frequently; Alex discovered that Oscar slept with Victor's mother; and finally, we again see Oscar meet Victor at The Void to sell him drugs, only to be shot in the bathroom.|$|E

25|$|We must refuse {{everything}} to the Jews as a nation and accord {{everything to}} Jews as individuals. We must withdraw recognition from their judges; they should only have our judges. We must refuse legal protection {{to the maintenance of}} the so-called laws of their Judaic organization; they {{should not be allowed to}} form in the state either a political body or an order. They must be citizens individually. But, some will say to me, they do not want to be citizens. Well then! If they do not want to be citizens, they should say so, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>we</b> should banish them. It is repugnant to have in the state an association of non-citizens, and a nation within the nation...|$|E
25|$|Thus we {{have the}} President of the Reorganized Church and son of Joseph Smith admitting, as well as apologizing for the rash {{statements}} {{of his father and}} other leaders in the old church, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> have Joseph F. Smith of the Utah church using about the same argument to excuse the language and murderous conduct of the Danites in Utah. All we care to say is reply to both of these descendants of the original prophet and organizer of the Danite Band is, that when the leading members and officers of the church for many years teach and practice, by threats and murders, ascribed to the Danite Band, then we believe the public is justified in denouncing such language and conduct, and affirming it to be the doctrine of the church.|$|E

500|$|The band's lead singer/guitarist Patrick Stump {{stated that}} the band had not planned to cover the song. [...] "Basically, I just started playing the riff in sound-check one day, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> all started playing it, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> started playing it live, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> figured we'd record {{it and put it}} out with our live DVD." [...] Bassist Pete Wentz added that the band had not {{originally}} intended for the song to be released as a single either. [...] "'Beat It' seemed like a song that would be cool and that we could do our own take on", he said. Having spent time deciding on a guitarist for the song, Wentz eventually called John Mayer to add the guitar solo. [...] "We were trying to think about who is a contemporary guitar guy who's going to go down as a legend", Wentz later noted.|$|E
500|$|Thalberg {{also stated}} that he [...] "took no chances in cutting it. We took it around to {{different}} theaters in the suburbs, ran it at its enormous length, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> took note of the places at which interest seemed to droop." ...|$|E

500|$|More than 750 {{slaves were}} rescued in the Combahee River Raid. Newspapers heralded Tubman's [...] "patriotism, sagacity, energy, [...] ability", {{and she was}} praised for her {{recruiting}} efforts – most of the newly liberated men went on to join the Union army. Tubman later worked with Colonel Robert Gould Shaw at the assault on Fort Wagner, reportedly serving him his last meal. She described the battle by saying: [...] "And then we saw the lightning, {{and that was the}} guns; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> heard the thunder, and that was the big guns; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> heard the rain falling, and that was the drops of blood falling; and when we came to get the crops, it was dead men that we reaped." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1948, Flanders and Swann wrote a {{song called}} [...] "In the D'Oyly Cart", a satire {{of the company and}} the rote [...] "business" [...] and {{gestures}} that it was accused of repeating. [...] The song was first performed in the revue Oranges and Lemons (1948) and revived in Penny Plain (1951). [...] It was broadcast in 1974 and included as the first track on the 1975 Flanders and Swann album, <b>And</b> <b>Then</b> <b>We</b> Wrote.|$|E

500|$|For {{the final}} twelve episodes of the season, Marvel once again ran the [...] "Art of..." [...] initiative, {{in which a}} {{different}} image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode, with the season's title being [...] "The Art of Evolution". The different artists were once again chosen to create the teaser posters, based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode. On how what is shown on each poster is chosen, Bell said, [...] "maybe we'll show [...] the script or let them watch the episode and let them respond to it emotionally and see what's interesting to them. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> {{have a conversation with}} them about how we'd like to portray that, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> try to lean into the strengths that they have. Some are more graphic, some are more character based, some are more composite, and some are cleaner. And that's one of the things [...] really look forward to each week, getting the initial sketches back from the artists and seeing their interpretation." [...] The art once again appeared as variant covers to select titles published by Marvel Comics in June 2015.|$|E
500|$|For his part, Rodgers {{recalled}} {{that he had}} first seen Madonna perform at a small club in New York in 1983. In an interview with Time magazine, Rodgers explained: [...] "I went to the club to see another woman sing, but when I got there Madonna was onstage. I loved her stage presence <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> met right after that. I kept thinking to myself, 'Damn, is she a star', but she wasn't at that time. I always {{wanted to work with}} her and Like a Virgin seemed like a perfect opportunity." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{filming the}} scene with Michael in the improv class, Ken Jeong, who played Bill, said that [...] "they (the crew) would shoot the scenes as scripted the first few takes, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> would improvise after that." [...] For example, [...] "the scene where I (Ken Jeong) say 'Good job' to Michael and he says 'Nice job, Bill... not' was improvised." [...] Jeong, who had {{previously}} taken part in an actual improv class, noted that [...] "Anyone who's ever taken an improv class appreciates that bit [...]" ...|$|E

We were devastated [...] I certainly don't have any bad feelings toward Eminem. He was gracious enough to let us use the song on the album—and we use [...] "The Real Slim Shady" [...] in the [...] "Angry White Boy Polka" [...] medley, too. But this is the first album I've ever released without an accompanying video.|$|E
500|$|Blige further {{revealed}} that the song would be released as a single but was delayed due to Beyoncé's pregnancy at that time adding that, [...] "whenever she's ready, if she's ever ready, I'm ready and it'll be great." [...] During an interview with Rap-Up magazine, Garrett further spoke about the collaboration, saying, [...] "I initially did the record for Beyoncé <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> just felt {{it would be an}} even bigger record with Beyoncé and Mary J. Blige... Both these women are two iconic female figures in the world, and what would be better than putting those two on a record? We felt it would be a really iconic move." ...|$|E
500|$|Farrell met English {{actress and}} singer Amelia Warner at {{the premiere of}} Quills in 2000. They dated from July to November 2001. There was {{speculation}} that they married; of the experience, the actor said [...] "Too fast, too young." [...] However, in December 2011 Warner told The Sun that the marriage was never legal: [...] "We had a ceremony {{on a beach in}} Tahiti that was by no means legal and we knew it wasn't... It was just a thing we did on holiday. We went shark feeding <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> did that. We booked them both on the activities desk at the hotel."
