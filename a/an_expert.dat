Besides the making of <b>an</b> <b>expert’s</b> detailed report on reconstructed state road R 3 / 620 - 6381 Štorje-Štanjel, an administrative procedure of recording a settled road is introduced, although {{this is no longer}} a part of a geodesic service.

Other regulations that have to be considered at field measurement, at ways of marking off the road and in making <b>an</b> <b>expert’s</b> detailed report, are described as well. The combination of classical and GPS procedure measurement in Geodesy is almost indispensable, the details of it are also described in the thesis.
