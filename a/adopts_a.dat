Scandium hydride is not well understood, although it appears not to be a saline hydride of Sc(II). As is observed for most elements, a diatomic scandium hydride has been observed spectroscopically at high temperatures in the gas phase. Scandium borides and carbides are non-stoichiometric, as is typical for neighboring elements.|$|E
5|$|Goldman pursued an {{independent}} education on her own, however, and {{soon began to}} study the political turmoil around her, particularly the Nihilists responsible for assassinating Alexander II of Russia.
