5|$|Among the downsides {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} was pollution. Brick firing produced {{particulate air pollution}} and paint-making created lead dust, while beer <b>and</b> <b>liquor</b> brewing produced grain swill. The worst pollution was coal dust and smoke, for which St. Louis was infamous by the 1890s. The greatest number of complaints to the St. Louis Board of Health were due to industries engaged in rendering, which produced noxious fumes. In spite of this, pollution control was hindered {{by a desire to}} promote growth. One of the few controls began in 1880, in which regulations would be enforced strictly in some areas while little in others, thereby encouraging factories to concentrate in industrial districts.|$|E
5|$|Bars and {{restaurants}} are considered strictly liable for their patrons' behavior, <b>and</b> <b>liquor</b> licenses can be suspended or revoked if a customer engages in illegal activity (e.g. fighting, public urination) after drinking. New Jersey law recognizes both dram shop liability and social host liability, wherein the server of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons or minors is liable {{if that person}} then causes death or injury to a third party in an alcohol-related automobile collision or other accident. In order to mitigate liability, the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) grants licensed establishments the right to exclude any patron for any reason, but warns business against violating civil rights laws.|$|E

5|$|Supermarkets, {{convenience}} stores, and {{gas stations}} in New Jersey rarely sell alcoholic beverages because state law prohibits any person or corporation from possessing {{more than two}} retail distribution licenses. While licenses for bars, restaurants <b>and</b> <b>liquor</b> stores are limited, other retail licenses are not.

5|$|The {{number of}} Class C retail {{licenses}} for bars, restaurants, <b>and</b> <b>liquor</b> stores {{is limited by}} population and often by municipal ordinances. Licenses are typically obtained from existing licensees who choose to sell, or when a new license is offered as a town's population grows. As a result, the price for a retail license is often prohibitively expensive. The sale of a new license is usually conducted by public auction. The intense competition can benefit a town by generating {{several hundred thousand dollars}} of revenue from the highest bidder. A 2006 license auction in Cherry Hill, New Jersey set the state record at $1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|Another legend {{tells the}} story of {{conversion}} of Chamunda into a Jain goddess. According to this story, Chamunda sculpted the Mahavira image for the temple in Osian, Jodhpur and was happy with the conversions of the Oswals to Jainism. At the time of Navratri, a festival that celebrates the Divine Mother, Chamunda expected animal sacrifices from the converted Jains. The vegetarian Jains, however, were unable to meet her demand. Ratnaprabhasuri intervened, and as a result, Chamunda accepted vegetarian offerings, forgoing her demand for meat <b>and</b> <b>liquor.</b> Ratnaprabhsuri further named her Sacciya, one who had told the truth, as Chamunda had told him the truth that a rainy season stay in Osian would be beneficial for him. She also became the protective goddess of the temple and remained the clan goddess, Kuladevi, of the Oswals. The Sachiya Mata Temple in Osian was built in her honour. Some Jain scriptures warn of dire consequences of worship of Chamunda by the Hindu rites and rituals.|$|E

A prolific Chinese writer, Wu Sijing, held her 17-table wedding banquet there in 1952, and was photographed in a white bridal dress, {{with her husband in}} a white suit and bowtie. This choice of dress would have been most unusual amongst mainland Chinese due to the nationalistic influence of Mao-era China, highlighting Singapore's confluence between Eastern and Western cultures, of which the hotel was at the forefront.

5|$|Local {{government}} divisions, {{in descending}} order by size, were the province, commandery, county, and district. Local fiefs of the nobility included the kingdom, which was modeled largely upon the regular commandery, {{as well as the}} marquessate, modelled largely upon the regular county. Although the central government's monopolies on salt, iron, <b>and</b> <b>liquor</b> eventually failed and were relinquished back to private production, the government successfully nationalized the issuing of coin currency through its imperial mint, which lasted from 113 BC {{until the end of the}} dynasty. The conscription system for commoners as non-professional soldiers was reduced in size in favor of a volunteer army and a substitution tax by Eastern Han. A small professional standing army existed throughout Western and Eastern Han. During times of crisis, the volunteer army increased in size, but large militias were raised and certain officer titles were revived for temporary use.|$|E
5|$|On June 30, 1975, {{four days}} after finalizing her divorce from Sonny, Cher married rock {{musician}} Gregg Allman, co-founder of The Allman Brothers Band.

Sonny and Cher's TV reunion, The Sonny and Cher Show, debuted on CBS in February 1976—the first show ever to star a divorced couple. Although the show was a ratings success on its premiere, Cher and Sonny's insulting onscreen banter about their divorce, her reportedly extravagant lifestyle, and her troubled relationship with Allman caused a public backlash that eventually contributed to the show's cancellation in August 1977.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{civilian}} administration encouraged Japanese {{businessmen and}} settlers to the expand phosphate mining and copra production, which came into commercial existence during the German colonial era. During this time, new infrastructure was built between towns—including road and harbour facilities, and electricity and sewerage lines were laid out. Immigration from Japan, Okinawa and Korea to Palau intensified {{as a result}} of new job opportunities. A state-owned enterprise, Nanyo Kohatsu Kabushiki Kaisha (South Seas Colonization Corporation) was formed in 1936 to streamline the islands' economic activities with the administration objective of developing the islands' self-sufficiency capabilities. In the late 1930s, Japanese pearl divers made regular visits to the Arafura Sea, and stopped by Palau from October to April. The influx of pearl divers from Japan {{led to the development of}} the island's tourist industry, and some Japanese settlers from Saipan opened new cafés, geisha houses <b>and</b> <b>liquor</b> houses in Koror to cater to the pearl divers during their stopovers in between October to April.|$|E

This democratically elected legislature became the Oregon Territorial Legislature when the territorial authorities arrived after the creation of the Oregon Territory by the United States in 1848. The body was first termed the Legislative Committee and later renamed the House of Representatives.

5|$|To {{pay for his}} {{military}} campaigns and colonial expansion, Emperor Wu nationalized several private industries. He created central government monopolies administered largely by former merchants. These monopolies included salt, iron, <b>and</b> <b>liquor</b> production, as well as bronze-coin currency. The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC, and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han. The issuing of coinage remained a central government monopoly {{throughout the rest of}} the Han dynasty. The government monopolies were eventually repealed when a political faction known as the Reformists gained greater influence in the court. The Reformists opposed the Modernist faction that had dominated court politics in Emperor Wu's reign and during the subsequent regency of Huo Guang (d.68 BC). The Modernists argued for an aggressive and expansionary foreign policy supported by revenues from heavy government intervention in the private economy. The Reformists, however, overturned these policies, favoring a cautious, non-expansionary approach to foreign policy, frugal budget reform, and lower tax-rates imposed on private entrepreneurs.|$|E

The only {{daughter}} of American businessman Frederick Leslie Hanks and Chinese-Hawaiian Akini, Charlotte was of mixed-Caucasian, Native Hawaiian and Chinese descent. Her father was allegedly {{a relative of}} Nancy Hanks, the mother of President Abraham Lincoln, and had settled in Hawaii after his second visit in 1853. A descendant of the Kahaloipua line of chiefs, her genealogy was considered of a higher rank than her husband. Her maternal grandfather was the early Chinese businessman Tyhune (i.e. Wong Tai-hoon), who owned the Tyhune Store in downtown Honolulu from the 1830s to the 1850s and invested in sugar, shipping, merchandise, <b>and</b> <b>liquor</b> sales. She inherited lands in Waikiki and Honolulu from her maternal grandmother Wahinekapu, a Hawaiian chiefess and the daughter or sister of Kahanaumaikai, {{who had been a}} recipient of land in the Great Māhele.

5|$|The SS owned {{experimental}} farms, bakeries, meat packing plants, leather works, {{clothing and}} uniform factories, and small arms factories. Under {{the direction of}} the WVHA, the SS sold camp labor to various factories at a rate of three to six Reichsmarks per prisoner per day. The SS confiscated and sold the property of concentration camp inmates, confiscated their investment portfolios and their cash, and profited from their dead bodies by selling their hair to make felt and melting down their dental work to obtain gold from the fillings. The total value of assets looted from the victims of Operation Reinhard alone (not including Auschwitz) was listed by Odilo Globocnik as 178,745,960.59 Reichsmarks. Items seized included 2,909.68 kilograms of gold worth 843,802.75 RM, as well as 18,733.69kg of silver, 1,514kg of platinum, 249,771.50 American dollars, 130 diamond solitaires, 2,511.87 carats of brilliants, 13,458.62 carats of diamonds, and 114kg of pearls.

5|$|Upon {{repeal of}} Prohibition and {{the passage of}} the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, the ABC issued {{regulations}} that prohibited bars <b>and</b> <b>liquor</b> stores from selling alcohol to a person under 21, which was considered the age of majority at that time. In 1939, it became a criminal offense to sell alcohol to a person under 21, and for a person under 21 to purchase or consume alcohol in a licensed establishment. The state criminalized the underage possession of alcohol in motor vehicles and other public areas in 1957, possibly in response to young New Jerseyans traveling to New York, where the drinking age was 18, and returning home with liquor. For many years laws against underage drinking and the serving of alcohol to minors did not apply on private property, though an adult who supplied a substantial amount of liquor to an underage person could possibly be prosecuted for contributing to the delinquency of a minor Furthermore, arrests and criminal prosecutions for underage drinking in bars or public areas were very uncommon before the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Another side {{trade was}} {{smuggling}} along the Pacific {{coast of the}} Spanish Empire, where foreign trade was prohibited by Spanish law. This trade peaked in the 1810s, then faded in the 1820s. Traders concentrated on Alta California, which produced a surplus of grain, beef, tallow, and hides, but was chronically short of manufactured goods. American ships brought goods to the missions of Alta California in exchange for grain, beef, and Californian sea otter skins. The grain, beef, and other provisions were taken to Sitka, which was perennially short of foods supplies. After Mexico gained independence in 1821 the American trade with Alta California continued in a slightly modified form. American traders brought mostly clothing, cottons, silks, lace, cutlery, alcohol, and sugar, which were traded for hides and tallow at a profit generally between 200% and 300%. The California Hide Trade became a major industry in its own right. By the 1830s, however, the missions of Alta California had been secularized by Mexican authorities and deserted by Indian labourers. The trade slid into unprofitability. The decline of the American trade with Alta California left just one significant alternative to the ever-dwindling sea otter trade—the provisioning of the settlements of Russian America, which lasted until the Americans abandoned the North West Coast altogether in the early 1840s. From {{the first decade of}} the 19th century until 1841 American ships visited Sitka regularly, trading provisions, textiles, <b>and</b> <b>liquor</b> for fur seal skins, timber, and fish. This trade was usually highly profitable for the Americans and the Russian settlements depended on it. Thus when Tsar NicholasI issued the ukase of 1821, banning foreign trade north of the 51st parallel, the Russian colonies in America were forced to ignore the ban and engage in smuggling.|$|E
