5|$|The {{fundamental}} DNA-based research {{carried out}} by Singh and his colleagues on primitive tribes including the tribal population of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, provided critical insights into the evolution and migration of humans, suggesting the out of Africa route of modern humans about 60,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Andaman Islands. These findings have furthered the scientific community's understanding {{of the origin of}} man in terms of evolution and migration from place to place.|$|E
5|$|The mammals {{represent}} the only living Synapsida, which {{together with the}} Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The early synapsid mammalian ancestors were sphenacodont pelycosaurs, a group that produced the non-mammalian Dimetrodon. At {{the end of the}} Carboniferous period, this group diverged from the sauropsid line that led to today's reptiles and birds. The line following the stem group Sphenacodontia split-off several diverse groups of non-mammalian synapsids—sometimes referred to as mammal-like reptiles—before giving rise to the proto-mammals (Therapsida) in the early Mesozoic era. The modern mammalian orders arose in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era, after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, and have been among the dominant terrestrial animal groups from 66 million years <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> present.|$|E

He attributes the divergence of the two species from a common ancestor to a change in their ecological niche; the ancestors of chimpanzees remained in the forests of equatorial Africa, whereas the ancestors of humans moved to open woodland and were exposed to different evolutionary pressures. Although Wade posits that much of human evolution {{can be attributed to the}} physical environment, he also believes that one of the major forces shaping evolution has been the nature of human society itself.|$|E

5|$|Magmatism in the Anahim Volcanic Belt can {{be traced}} {{as far back as}} 10–14million years ago with the {{emplacement}} of dike swarms and plutons as well as the eruption of rhyolite flows and breccias on the British Columbia Coast. The slow continuous westward motion of the North American Plate during the late Neogene positioned the Anahim hotspot further east at the Chilcotin Plateau where volcanic activity built the Rainbow Range shield volcano 8.7to 6.7million years ago. Volcanism then shifted eastwards, in displacement contrary with the North American Plate's movement, 6.1million years <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> construct <b>the</b> Ilgachuz Range shield volcano, which became extinct 2.1million years later. Renewed volcanic activity southeast of the Ilgachuz Range starting 3.5million years <b>ago</b> led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> creation of the Itcha Range, the youngest of the three Anahim shield volcanoes.

25|$|Hot springs {{are present}} {{throughout}} the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, indicating magmatic heat is present under the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. They are formed if water percolates deeply through the crust and heats {{up from the}} primal magmatic heat under the surface. After the groundwater is heated, the heated groundwater rises to the surface as a hot spring. In some cases, the heated groundwater may rise along extensional faults related to rifting in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. The Lakelse Hot Springs near Lakelse Lake Provincial Park in northern British Columbia is interpreted to be one such example. With a temperature of , the springs are the hottest in Canada. It is also possible the magma associated with the Nass Valley eruption 250 years <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north rose along the same north trending fault lines fueling the Lakelse Hot Springs.

25|$|Walking with Monsters (also {{distributed}} as Before the Dinosaurs - Walking with Monsters or Walking with Monsters - Life Before Dinosaurs) is {{a three-part}} British documentary film series {{about life in}} the Paleozoic, and briefly into the Mesozoic, bringing to life extinct arthropods, fish, amphibians, synapsids, and reptiles. As with previous Walking with... instalments, it is narrated by Kenneth Branagh. Using state-of-the-art visual effects, this prequel to Walking with Dinosaurs shows an epic 300 million year war between creatures before the dinosaurs. The series draws on the knowledge of over 600 scientists and depicts Paleozoic history, from the Cambrian Period (530 million years <b>ago)</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Early Triassic Period (248 million years ago). It was written and directed by Tim Haines. As with some of the other BBC specials, it was renamed in North America, where its title was Before the Dinosaurs: Walking with Monsters. It has also aired as a two-hour special on the Canadian and American Discovery Channel with yet another narrator, although Branagh's narration can still sometimes be heard. At the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2006 it won the Emmy Award in the category Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or More).|$|E
