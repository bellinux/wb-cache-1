2500|$|Among the {{services}} that AT aggressively promotes is its Rollover Minutes service, which allows customers to keep unused minutes from month to month on a twelve-month rolling cycle on its popular nationwide plans. Beginning in July 2007, AT allows its AT Unity plan users to have Rollover, a service which was exclusive to the Nation plans. AT also launched video share in 2007, in which a mobile caller can stream live video from one phone to another over the 3G network with video share capable phones. This allows one mobile phone user to view video from another user's camera through the mobile phone in real time. AT also had A-list, similar to former competitor Alltel's program launched on April 20, 2006 branded [...] "My Circle." [...] AT rolled out the A-list program on September 20, 2009. Customers with individual Nation plans of $59.99 or higher could use A-List with Rollover to select up to five domestic phone numbers to call anytime—including landlines and wireless numbers on any network—without using any of the minutes in their plan. FamilyTalk customers with plans of $89.99 or more could select up to ten numbers which any person in the FamilyTalk plan can call {{as much as they}} want. Effective September 1, 2011, the A-List feature is no longer available to new consumer and IRU customers. Existing customers who had A-List on their <b>account</b> <b>prior</b> to September 1, 2011, are able to keep the feature as long as they stay on a qualifying rate plan. As of October 25, 2013 AT no longer offers Nation Plans or Family Talk Plans to its new customers. New customers are now required to have one of AT Mobile Share Value plans which include unlimited Talk, Text and a shareable bucket of data start at $45 for a smartphone. As of January 8, 2016 AT no longer offers 2 year contracts for subsidized smart phones to its consumer customers. Customers who currently have 2 year contracts are grandfathered, until they upgrade to a new device they will have to choose from AT's NEXT installment plans for smartphones. AT has also reintroduced unlimited data plans for its customers who also have either AT U-verse or AT's newly acquired DirecTV. Unlimited data plans may be speed throttled after 22 GB of data have been used. With the inclusion of these new plans AT has also introduced a free roaming in Mexico feature for its postpaid customers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new nonlinear filtering algorithm that {{is shown to}} outperform state-of-the-art particle filters with resampling. Starting from the Itô stochastic differential equation, the proposed algorithm harnesses Karhunen-Loéve expansion to derive an approximate non-autonomous dynamical system, for which transfer operator based density computation can be performed in exact arithmetic. It is proved that the algorithm is asymptotically consistent in mean-square sense. Numerical results demonstrate that explicitly <b>accounting</b> <b>prior</b> dynamics entail significant performance improvement for nonlinear non-Gaussian estimation problems with infrequent measurement updates, {{as compared to the}} performance of particle filters.
