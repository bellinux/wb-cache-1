5|$|The Menominee Indian Tribe {{had entered}} {{into a series of}} {{treaties}} with the United States that did not specifically state that they had hunting <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> rights. In 1961, Congress terminated the tribe's federal recognition, ending its right to govern itself, federal support of health care and education programs, police and fire protection, and tribal rights to land. In 1963, three members of the tribe were charged with violating Wisconsin's hunting <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> laws on land which had been a reservation for over 100 years. The tribe members were acquitted, but when the state appealed, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the Menominee tribe no longer had hunting <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> rights because of the termination action by Congress.|$|E
5|$|The tribe was {{represented}} by Charles A. Hobbs of Washington, D.C. The tribe argued that the Menominee Termination Act did not extinguish treaty rights, but instead had two purposes; to terminate federal supervision of the tribe and to transfer to the state general criminal and civil jurisdictionwhich had already been accomplished by Public Law 280 and that law expressly preserved hunting <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> rights. In {{the event that the}} court would decide that the hunting <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> rights were extinguished, then the tribe should receive compensation for the loss of the rights.|$|E

40|$|Meat, milk <b>and</b> <b>fish</b> are {{critical}} to the poor both as food and income. While research has hugely increased farm production in rich countries, it hasn't succeeded yet to help the millions of family farms in developing nations to raise their production very much. The CGIAR research program on livestock <b>and</b> <b>fish</b> is experimenting with a different approach. Called ‘More meat, milk <b>and</b> <b>fish</b> by <b>and</b> for the poor’, it's addressing the whole way these foods move from small farms to tables. This so-called ‘food chain’ includes producing, processing, selling and consuming meat, milk <b>and</b> <b>fish.</b> The plan is within a decade to see more meat, milk <b>and</b> <b>fish</b> being produced <b>and</b> consumed {{by the people who}} need it most...|$|R
