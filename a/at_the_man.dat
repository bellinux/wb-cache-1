5|$|In Muncie, Indiana, Nora Pearce and Curtis Delario {{argue about}} the death of her husband, Ray. Nora {{believes}} Ray died from Gulf War syndrome. After attempting to comfort her, Delario starts to drive home and crashes into a man {{in the middle of the}} road. His car is totaled, but the man is unharmed as the car breaks around his body. Curtis, grievously injured, looks up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> and says, “Ray?” The man’s arm slams through the windshield as Curtis screams.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} summer, Greatfoot is {{run over}} and killed while {{crossing}} a freeway during a hunt. The pups begin hearing a strange wolf howl, but when they track it they find a fresh kill and the familiar human scent. New kills appear every few days as the young wolves grow larger and stronger. One night when they hear the unusual howl, they are closer than usual to it and reach the kill in time to meet their benefactor, a human male. The pack stares <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> before disappearing back into the forest, ignoring his howl. As he goes to leave, however, the six return {{to the edge of}} the clearing and howl.|$|E
5|$|On 11 January 2006, Venerable Ho died peacefully in {{her sleep}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> Fut Tong Nursing Home, at about 9:30pm, just one month before turning 98. Until being {{hospital}}ised in November 2005, she had cooked for and looked after herself and played {{an active role in}} running both the temple and the nursing home. During her hospital stay, she suffered a stroke, which affected her speech and paralysed the left side of her body. Discharged in December 2005, she was recuperating well at the nursing home until she developed a chest infection and breathing difficulties a few days before she died.|$|E

5|$|Stephen Stickler {{acted as}} the band's photographer, and Jay Papke and Dante Ariola {{directed}} the album's cover art and booklet. The cover depicts {{a little girl}} in a purple dress with a matching bow in her blonde hair, bringing her swing to a stop to squint in the sun <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> standing before her. The man is only seen as a dark shadow on the ground, and is holding {{what appears to be a}} horse shoe or, more presumably, blades. The band's logo, a childlike drawing of the band's name created by lead singer Jonathan Davis, is seen on the sandy ground by Dark Shadow; the way it's positioned next to the girls' shadow makes it appear the latter is being hanged.|$|E

500|$|The Avrocar story did not {{end with}} the {{termination}} of the program. Only two Avrocars were ever produced and because the U.S. military had paid for the work, they reverted to U.S. ownership {{at the end of}} the program. The second example, S/N 59-4975, utilized for [...] "flight" [...] testing, returned to Canada briefly for display in Montreal <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> and His World Exhibition (1968); after a lengthy period of outdoor display, it is now under restoration at the U.S. Army Transportation Museum in Fort Eustis, Virginia.|$|E
500|$|From their {{advantageous}} height by Königgrätz, the Austrians frequently bombarded the Prussian army encamped below them. On {{the same}} day that Frederick's doctors bled him, an Austrian cannonade grew so strong that Frederick rode out to observe the damage. During the ride, his vein opened. A company medic bound his wound, an incident later depicted by the painter Bernhard Rode. In his admiring history of Frederick the Great, the English historian Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) relayed the story of Frederick and a Croatian marksman. As Frederick was reconnoitering, Carlyle maintained, the King encountered the Croat taking aim at him. Reportedly, he wagged his finger <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> as if to say, [...] "Do not do that." [...] The Croat thought better of shooting the King, and disappeared into the woods; some reports maintain he actually knelt before the king and kissed his hand.|$|E
500|$|Bathurst's {{professional}} stage debut {{came the}} next year {{when he joined the}} second cast of Michael Frayn's Noises Off at the Savoy Theatre. He replaced Roger Lloyd-Pack as Tim Allgood and stayed at the Savoy for a year. Between roles, he worked as a television presenter for BBC East. After declining an offer to be a presenter of That's Life! he joined the National Theatre in 1984, where he appeared as a background actor in Saint Joan. He regards it as [...] "the most demoralising" [...] job he has ever had but was grateful for the theatre experience it gave him. The following year, he appeared <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> In The Moon, a pub theatre in Chelsea, in Judgement, a two-hour monologue on cannibalism. The opening night audience was made up of three people but after good reviews in the national press the audience grew to an average of fifteen.|$|E

500|$|In March 1916, the 5th Division {{was sent}} [...] {{across the desert}} to defend the Suez Canal. The {{crossing}} was first attempted by the 14th Brigade, who suffered badly. Elliott personally inspected the route, talked with officers familiar with it, and drew up a new timetable for the march, managing to get his men across with {{only a handful of}} casualties. On the march, one man forgot the ban on smoking. Elliott characteristically started to scream <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> even threatening to shoot him. Out from the ranks came a shout: [...] "If you shoot him, I'll shoot you." [...] When the soldier who called out was brought forward and explained that no one talked to his brother like that, Elliott sent the man to his school for non-commissioned officers, with the rationale that anyone who could stand up to himself in full flight clearly had leadership potential.|$|E
500|$|In the evening, {{a man of}} {{the family}} brings their badnjak into the house. If {{there is more than one}} badnjak, the {{thickest}} of them is regarded as the main one, and is brought in first. Stepping across the threshold, right foot first, the man greets his gathered family with the words [...] "Good evening and happy Christmas Eve to you." [...] The woman of the house greets him back, saying [...] "May God give you well-being, and may you have good luck", or [...] "Good luck to you, and together with you for many years to come [...] ", or similar, before throwing grain from a sieve <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> and the badnjak he carries. In the clan of Kuči, the woman touches the [...] "beard" [...] of the main badnjak with a whole loaf of bread. In Montenegro, two women holding lighted candles stand one on either side of the house door as the badnjaks are carried in.|$|E
500|$|Halperin {{described}} [...] "This Moment" [...] and [...] "Ghost" [...] as [...] "mid-tempo ballads {{that are}} closest in DNA to Perry's previous smashes". Perry stated {{that she was}} inspired to write [...] "This Moment" [...] after she heard the audio book of The Power of Now; the song's lyrics talk about [...] "living in the present"; with Perry [...] "add a romantic spin" [...] to it. Gary Trust described [...] "Ghost" [...] as a [...] "mesmerizing ballad", while Gundersen described it as [...] "powerful, dark, and haunting". Lipshutz felt that [...] "Ghost" [...] and [...] "By the Grace of God" [...] contain the album's [...] "most somber moments". While talking about each Prism track, Perry mentioned that [...] "By the Grace of God" [...] was the first song she wrote and recorded for the album back in November 2012 {{while she was in}} her [...] "dark" [...] phase. Jody Rosen from Vulture described bonus track [...] "Spiritual" [...] as an inspirational song. Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast described [...] "It Takes Two" [...] as a [...] "sweeping ballad" [...] which allowed Perry to [...] "show off a full-throated belt that so many of her more bubbly tracks mask". In [...] "Choose Your Battles", Perry [...] "pounds her chest and spews venom <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> she cannot understand".|$|E

500|$|The {{morning after}} the broadcast, several tabloid {{newspapers}} attacked the documentary, accusing it of sensationalism and [...] "trial by television". In the following days, they mounted a campaign against Carmen Proetta, one of the documentary's main witnesses, accusing her of being a former prostitute and of being anti-British; Proetta later successfully sued several newspapers for libel. Other newspapers accused [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] of misrepresenting the eyewitnesses' statements and criticised the IBA for allowing the documentary to be broadcast. The eyewitnesses interviewed for [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] gave evidence at the inquest into the shootings; most repeated the statements they had given the programme, but one witness—who had told the programme {{he had seen a}} soldier stand over one of the IRA members and fire <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> while he was on the ground—retracted his previous statement. As a result of the retraction, Thames commissioned an independent inquiry into the making of [...] "Death on the Rock"—the first time an inquiry had been commissioned into the making of an individual documentary. The Windlesham–Rampton report found that the programme's tendency was to present evidence that the IRA members had been unlawfully killed, but that it sought to raise questions rather than to reach a conclusion. The authors made several criticisms of the documentary, but overall found it a [...] "trenchant" [...] work of journalism, made in [...] "good faith and without ulterior motives". Thames lost its franchise and the IBA was abolished {{as a result of the}} Broadcasting Act 1990—decisions which several involved parties believed were influenced by the government's anger at [...] "Death on the Rock".|$|E
