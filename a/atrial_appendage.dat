5|$|The {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the {{receiving}} chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, {{present in the}} atrioventricular septum. This distinction is visible also {{on the surface of}} the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right <b>atrial</b> <b>appendage,</b> or auricle, and another in the upper left atrium, the left <b>atrial</b> <b>appendage.</b> The right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart. Similarly, the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible {{on the surface of the}} heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus.|$|E
5|$|The left atrium {{receives}} oxygenated blood {{back from}} the lungs via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. The left atrium has an outpouching called the left <b>atrial</b> <b>appendage.</b> Like the right atrium, the left atrium is lined by pectinate muscles. The left atrium is connected to the left ventricle by the mitral valve.|$|E
5|$|The right atrium {{receives}} blood almost continuously {{from the}} body's two major veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. A {{small amount of}} blood from the coronary circulation also drains into the right atrium via the coronary sinus, which is immediately above and {{to the middle of}} the opening of the inferior vena cava. In the wall of the right atrium is an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis, which is a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. Most of the internal surface of the right atrium is smooth, the depression of the fossa ovalis is medial, and the anterior surface has prominent ridges of pectinate muscles, which are also present in the right <b>atrial</b> <b>appendage.</b>|$|E

40|$|Juxtaposition of the <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> is an {{apparently}} rare congenital cardiac anomaly {{in which the}} <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> lie side by side, both {{to the left or}} {{to the right of the}} great arteries, known as left or right juxtaposition of the <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages,</b> respectively (Dixon, 1954). This abnormality now may readily be diagnosed by angiocardiography (Ellis and Jameson, 1963), and it is widely regarded as an ominous sign of severe cyanotic congenital heart disease. Beyond this general impression, however, the specific types of cardiac malformation likely to be associated with juxtaposition of the <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages,</b> and the rela-tive frequencies of each, remain far from clear. This is not surprising since only 21 post-mortem cases have been published, to our knowledge, almost all as isolated case reports (see Table III). This paper represents an attempt to clarify the picture.

A trial comparing closure against warfarin therapy found closure to be non-inferior when measured against a composite end point of stroke, cardiovascular death and systemic embolism.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{a single}} {{pulmonary}} vein develops {{in the form}} of a bulge in the back wall of the left atrium. This vein will connect with the veins of the developing lung buds. As development proceeds the pulmonary vein and its branches are incorporated into the left atrium and they both form the smooth wall of the atrium.

40|$|AbstractIn a {{prospective}} investigation, direct visualization of both <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> was attempted during transesophageal echocardiographic studies in 132 patients with congenital heart disease. High quality cross-sectional images delineating the unique morphologic details of both <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> were obtained in every patient. Abnormal cardiac position such as dextrocardia (four patients) or mesocardia (two patients) did not pose any problems for transesophageal assessment of both <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages.</b> Thus, direct diagnosis of atrial situs was possible in every patient. Atrial situs solitus {{was present in}} 127 patients studied. Three patients {{were found to have}} situs inversus, one had left atrial isomerism and one had right atrial isomerism. No patient with juxtaposed <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> was encountered. All patients had prior subcostal ultrasound scans for assessment of the morphology and relation of the suprarenal abdominal great vessels and the related patterns of hepatic venous drainage. Patients with abnormal atrial situs had correlative high kilovoltage filter beam radiography for assessment of bronchus morphology. The results of situs determination obtained by either method were in agreement. In this series, transesophageal echocardiography allowed the direct and accurate visualization of both <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> and the determination of atrial situs in all patients studied. Transesophageal echocardiography may prove to be the most reliable in vivo technique for determination of atrial situs...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} 1042 reports of necropsies on {{children}} dying at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh was reviewed. In each case, note was {{taken of the}} status of the spleen, the lobation of the lungs, the arrangement of the bronchi, the morphology of the <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages,</b> and the presence of any congenital malformations of the heart and great vessels and of any malformations of the abdominal organs. There was isomerism of the left <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> in eight (0. 77 %), 13 (1. 25 %) showed isomerism of the right appendages, and seven (0. 67 %) had multiple spleens without having isomerism of the <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages.</b> Unexpectedly, a normal spleen was found in one patient with isomerism of the right appendages and also in a patient with isomerism of the left appendages. In one patient with isomeric left <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> there was no spleen. The review showed that the morphology of the <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages,</b> and hence the arrangement of the atria, is not accurately predicted by the type of spleen. The arrangement of the <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> is the most reliable guide to the recognised combinations of congenital cardiac malformations previously described as "splenic syndromes". Because there is no certain way of predicting all the malformations in patients with complex congenital heart disease, it is advisable to record separately for each patient the details of lobation of the lungs, the bronchial and atrial arrangement, anomalies of the heart and great vessels, the type of spleen, and any abnormal arrangement of the abdominal organs...|$|R

He had not been given penicillin prophylaxis. Asplenia was confirmed at necropsy.

25|$|The left <b>atrial</b> <b>appendage</b> {{can also}} be surgically amputated, sutured or stapled {{simultaneously}} with other cardiac procedures such as a maze procedure or during mitral valve surgery.|$|E
25|$|The TEE {{has much}} better {{visualization}} {{of the left}} <b>atrial</b> <b>appendage</b> than transthoracic echocardiography. This structure, located in the left atrium, {{is the place where}} a blood clot forms in more than 90% of cases in non-valvular (or non-rheumatic) atrial fibrillation. TEE has a high sensitivity for locating thrombi in this area and can also detect sluggish bloodflow in this area that is suggestive of blood clot formation.|$|E
25|$|Causes of {{disturbed}} {{blood flow}} include stagnation of blood flow {{past the point}} of injury, or venous stasis which may occur in heart failure, or after long periods of sedentary behaviour, such as sitting on a long airplane flight. Also, atrial fibrillation, causes stagnant blood in the left atrium (LA), or left <b>atrial</b> <b>appendage</b> (LAA), and can lead to a thromboembolism. Cancers or malignancies such as leukemia may cause increased risk of thrombosis by possible activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances (paraneoplastic syndrome), by external compression on a blood vessel when a solid tumor is present, or (more rarely) extension into the vasculature (for example, renal cell cancers extending into the renal veins). Also, treatments for cancer (radiation, chemotherapy) often cause additional hypercoagulability. There are scores that correlate different aspects of patient data (comorbidities, vital signs, and others) to risk of thrombosis, such as the POMPE-C, which stratifies risk of mortality due to pulmonary embolism in patients with cancer, who typically have higher rates of thrombosis.|$|E
30|$|Diagnosis of RAI {{remains a}} challenge. Patients with RAI have {{abnormalities}} {{in the lungs}} and various intra-abdominal organs, and {{each side of the}} heart morphologically resembles the right atrium and right <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages.</b> Most affected patients also have juxtaposition of the abdominal aorta and asplenia. Radiological diagnosis of RAI may be suspected on plain radiographic films of the chest and abdomen, by identifying the position of the liver and stomach, and bronchial pattern (Freedom and Fellow 1973). Echocardiographic or angiographic demonstration of a juxtaposition of the aorta and inferior vena cava, and morphology of the <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> are used to support the diagnosis (Huhta et al. 1982).|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of the <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> {{was examined}} in 1842 specimen hearts from patients with congenital lesions. The {{external and internal}} features that permitted {{the identification of the}} right and left appendages were studied in detail in one tenth of the hearts. These results were compared with a similar analysis of 25 normal hearts. This study showed that criteria for identification of right and left appendages were reliable. Application of these criteria to the overall collection identified the usual arrangement in 1776 (97 %) hearts, a mirror image arrangement in eight (0. 4 %); left atrial isomerism in 22 (1. 2 %); and right atrial isomerism in 36 (1. 9 %). Fourteen (0. 81 %) had juxtaposed <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> (13 with usual arrangement and one with left isomerism). This did not interfere with identification of the left and right atria on the basis of appendage morphology. In only two cases did the determination by atrial morphology produce a result that was inconsistent with the arrangement of the other thoracoabdominal organs. Further examination of the atria in these showed a mistake had been made in the initial assessment. The atrial arrangement can be accurately determined by the morphology of the <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{segments}} of human right <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> and pulmonary arteries preincubated with [3 H]-noradrenaline and superfused with physiological salt solution containing desipramine and corticosterone, {{the involvement of}} imidazoline receptors in the modulation of [3 H]-noradrenaline release was investigated. In human <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages,</b> the guanidines aganodine and DTG (1, 3 -di(2 -tolyl) guanidine) which activate presynaptic imidazoline receptors, inhibited electrically-evoked [3 H]-noradrenaline release. The inhibition was not affected by blockade of α 2 -adrenoceptors with 1 [*]μM rauwolscine, but antagonized by extremely high concentrations of this drug (10 and/or 30 [*]μM; apparent pA 2 against aganodine and DTG: 5. 55 and 5. 21, respectively). In the presence of 1 [*]μM rauwolscine, [3 H]-noradrenaline release in human <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> was also inhibited by the imidazolines idazoxan and cirazoline, but not by agmatine and noradrenaline. The inhibitory effects of 100 [*]μM idazoxan and 30 [*]μM cirazoline were abolished by 30 [*]μM rauwolscine. In the <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages,</b> the rank order of potency of all guanidines and imidazolines for their inhibitory effect on electrically-evoked [3 H]-noradrenaline release {{in the presence of}} 1 [*]μM rauwolscine was: aganodine⩾BDF[*] 6143 [4 -chloro- 2 -(2 -imidazolin- 2 -yl-amino) -isoindoline]>DTG⩾clonidine>cirazoline>idazoxan (BDF[*] 6143 and clonidine were previously studied under identical conditions). This potency order corresponded to that previously determined at the presynaptic imidazoline receptors in the rabbit aorta. When, in the experiments in the human pulmonary artery, rauwolscine was absent from the superfusion fluid, the concentration-response curve for BDF[*] 6143 (a mixed α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist/imidazoline receptor agonist) for its facilitatory effect on electrically-evoked [3 H]-noradrenaline release was bell-shaped. In the presence of 1 [*]μM rauwolscine, BDF[*] 6143 and cirazoline concentration-dependently inhibited the evoked [3 H]-noradrenaline release. In human <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages,</b> non-adrenoceptor [3 H]-idazoxan binding sites were identified and characterized. The binding of [3 H]-idazoxan was specific, reversible, saturable and of high affinity (KD: 25. 5 [*]nM). The specific binding of [3 H]-idazoxan (defined by cirazoline 0. 1 [*]mM) to membranes of human <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> was concentration-dependently inhibited by several imidazolines and guanidines, but not by rauwolscine and agmatine. In most cases, the competition curves were best fitted to a two-site model. The rank order of affinity for the high affinity site (in a few cases for the only detectable site; cirazoline=idazoxan>BDF[*] 6143 >DTG⩾clonidine) is compatible with the pharmacological properties of I 2 -imidazoline binding sites, but is clearly different from the rank order of potency for inhibiting evoked noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerves in the same tissue. It is concluded that noradrenaline release in the human atrium and, less well established, in the pulmonary artery is inhibited via presynaptic imidazoline receptors. These presynaptic imidazoline receptors appear to be related to those previously characterized in rabbit aorta and pulmonary artery, but differ clearly from I 1 and I 2 imidazoline binding sites...|$|R
2500|$|More than 90% {{of cases}} of thrombi {{associated}} with non-valvular atrial fibrillation evolve in the left <b>atrial</b> <b>appendage.</b> [...] However, the LAA lies in close relation to the free wall of the left ventricle and thus the LAA's emptying and filling, which determines its degree of blood stagnation, [...] may be helped by {{the motion of the}} wall of the left ventricle, if there is good ventricular function.|$|E
2500|$|In atrial fibrillation, {{the lack}} of an {{organized}} atrial contraction can result in some stagnant blood in the left atrium (LA) or left <b>atrial</b> <b>appendage</b> (LAA). This lack of movement of blood can lead to thrombus formation (blood clotting). If the clot becomes mobile and is carried away by the blood circulation, [...] it is called an embolus. [...] An [...] embolus proceeds through smaller and smaller arteries until it plugs one of them and prevents blood from flowing through the artery. This process results in end organ damage due to loss of nutrients, oxygen, and removal of cellular waste products. [...] Emboli in the brain may result in an ischemic stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA).|$|E
2500|$|Because {{there is}} little if any {{effective}} contraction of the atria there is stasis (pooling) {{of blood in the}} atria. [...] Stasis of blood in susceptible individuals can lead to the formation of a thrombus (blood clot) within the heart. A thrombus is most likely to form in the atrial appendages. A blood clot in the left <b>atrial</b> <b>appendage</b> is particularly important as {{the left side of the}} heart supplies blood to the entire body through the arteries. Thus, any thrombus material that dislodges from this side of the heart can embolize (break off and travel) to the brain's arteries, with the potentially devastating consequence of a stroke. Thrombus material can, of course, embolize to any other portion of the body, though usually with a less severe outcome.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{accurate}} prenatal diagnosis at 22 weeks gestation of right atrial isomerism {{in association with}} tricuspid atresia. Several distinctive sonographic features of isomerism of the right <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> were present in this fetus: complex cardiac abnormality, ventriculoarterial discordance, juxtaposition of the aorta and the inferior vena cava to the right side, pulmonary atresia, and anomalous pulmonary venous return to the morphological right atrium. Tricuspid atresia, which is an extremely rare lesion within heterotaxy spectrum disorders, was present. Postnatal investigations confirmed all prenatally diagnosed abnormalities, with additional findings of pulmonary atresia with discontinuous pulmonary arteries and bilateral arterial ducts, asplenia, and bilateral eparterial bronchi. To our knowledge, tricuspid atresia {{in the setting of}} isomerism of the right <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> has not previously been diagnosed or reported prenatally.

40|$|The {{description}} of totally anomalous systemic venous connection {{is limited to}} case reports. In this review, we seek to clarify anatomic, physiologic, and hemodynamic aspects of this extremely rare anomaly. We also present findings of two patients in whom connection of all the systemic veins was anomalous. In the first patient, with usual atrial arrangement, all systemic veins, including the coronary sinus, were connected anomalously to the morphologically left atrium. Limited left-to-right shunt across an atrial septal defect provided {{the only source of}} blood flow to the lungs. The diagnosis was established by saline contrast echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. Extreme hypoplasia of the right ventricle precluded corrective surgery, so we performed a bidirectional Glenn operation, along with atrial septectomy. The second patient had isomerism of the left <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages,</b> which creates problems in the definition in anatomic terms since the connection of the systemic veins can never be normal anatomically when both atriums possess a morphologically left appendage. Our patient, nonetheless, had all the systemic and pulmonary veins, connected to the left-sided atrial chamber which then connected to the left ventricle, thus producing hemodynamics of totally anomalous systemic venous connection. We propose an algorithm for evaluation of this hemodynamic combination and discuss management options. We also intend to clarify the potential differences between connection and drainage, with particular attention to the arrangement of <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages.</b> Even though the hemodynamics may be comparable, in anatomic terms, both systemic and pulmonary venoatrial connection will always be anomalous with isomeric <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages...</b>|$|R
40|$|Juxtaposition of the <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} cardiac malformation, {{with the}} appendages both located on {{the left or right}} side of the great arteries. It is usually associated with cyanotic congenital heart disease. The aim of this report is to illustrate the anatomical features of normal and juxtaposed <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages,</b> with a review of the associated anomalies. In the Anatomical Collection of Congenital Heart Disease of the University of Padua, consisting in 1, 526 specimens, we found 17 (1. 1 %) cases of <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> juxtaposition with left juxtaposition in 15 (88 %) and right juxtaposition in 2 (12 %). Complete form was present in 11 cases and partial form in 6. In left juxtaposition, the situs was solitus in all, and the most frequent anomalies were complete transposition of great arteries in 9 (60 %) and tricuspid atresia in 5 (33 %); anomalies of position of the heart in the thorax (dextro-mesocardia) were present in 46 % of cases, hypoplastic right ventricle in 73 %, abnormal relation of the great arteries and subaortic or bilateral infundibulum in all. In right atrial juxtaposition, the atrial situs was solitus with mitral and pulmonary atresia in one case and left isomerism with aortic atresia and double-inlet right ventricle in the other. In describing this malformation, we propose to maintain the use of a positional definition using the terms right and left juxtaposition to describe the presence of both the appendages on the right or {{on the left side of}} the great arteries, respectively. The use of a morphological definition should be added in cases of situs inversus or isomerism, with description of the morphology of the appendage located in the wrong position...|$|R

40|$|A {{prenatal}} diagnosis of right atrial isomerism is often inferred through {{the recognition of}} a constellation of cardiac anomalies on the four-chamber view or by the detection of visceral heterotaxy and asplenia. However, the actual occurrence of discordance between {{the arrangement of the}} atria and thoracic and abdominal organs makes the identification of the morphology of both <b>atrial</b> <b>appendages</b> the only reliable way to make a final diagnosis of atrial isomerism. Three cases of right atrial isomerism with visceral heterotaxy and a complex cardiac defect, diagnosed in utero by cross-sectional and colour flow Doppler echocardiography, are reported. In all the patients, the right atrial isomerism was associated with an atrioventricular septal defect, a single aortic outlet from the right ventricle, and total anomalous venous return.

We carried out a systematic comparative analysis of mouse and human fetal cardiovascular development. Methods—Episcopic fluorescence image capture (EFIC) was performed on 66 wild type mouse embryos from embryonic day (E) 9. 5 -birth; 2 D and 3 D datasets were compared with EFIC and magnetic resonance images (MRI) from a study of 52 human fetuses (Carnegie Stage (CS) 13 – 23).
