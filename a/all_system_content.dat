40|$|Various new mobile {{multimedia}} broadcasting systems are being deployed on the market. These systems are different {{for example in}} their radio part, transport methods and media formats. Harmonization of components between different systems is beneficial only when the selected system component is optimal for <b>all</b> <b>systems.</b> Audio <b>content</b> is and will be the main content type in broadcasting, with or without other content types. A good audio codec should provide consistent high quality for different audio types like speech, music, and speech mixed with music and maintain this high quality consistency even at low bit rates. That is essential when audio is delivered with some other content or data consuming most of the channel capacity. The Extended AMR-WB (AMR-WB+) audio codec meets these requirements, providing high quality at exceptionally low rates, {{and in the same}} time providing consistent quality over all audio types. It has been designed and standardized for 3 GPP audio services in Packet-switched Streamin...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} Source engine, the designers found that the game's scope exceeded their resources. Bloodlines has several styles of gameplay, requiring different interfaces, animations and artificial intelligence for stealth and melee combat, and first- or third-person capability. Compared to contemporary first-person shooters, with 10 to 20 animated character models, Bloodlines had over 150 characters with 3,000 unique animations, in {{addition to}} boss characters, with their own styles of movement. The designers underestimated {{the length of time}} required to develop and improve these systems. The game's scope suffered from content not being removed when necessary; other components would be endlessly refined without being finalized, preventing the developers from focusing on other parts of the game <b>system.</b> <b>All</b> <b>content</b> additionally required approval by White Wolf and Activision.|$|R

40|$|Queueing {{systems with}} batch service have been {{investigated}} extensively during the past decades. However, nearly all the studied models share the common feature that an uncorrelated arrival process is considered, which is unrealistic in several real-life situations. In this paper, we study a discrete-time queueing model, with a server that only initiates service when the amount of customers in <b>system</b> (<b>system</b> <b>content)</b> reaches or exceeds a threshold. Correlation is taken into account by assuming a discrete batch Markovian arrival process (D-BMAP), i. e. {{the distribution of the}} number of customer arrivals per slot depends on a background state which is determined by a first-order Markov chain. We deduce the probability generating function of the <b>system</b> <b>content</b> at random slot marks and we examine the influence of correlation in the arrival process on the behavior of the system. We show that correlation merely has a small impact on the threshold that minimizes the mean <b>system</b> <b>content.</b> In addition, we demonstrate that correlation might have a significant influence on the <b>system</b> <b>content</b> and therefore has {{to be included in the}} model...|$|R

In order to limit the havoc caused, {{anonymous}} apps are currently removing all abusive and harmful posts. Apps, such as Yik Yak, Secret, and Whisper, are removing these posts by outsourcing the job of content supervision to oversea surveillance companies. These companies hire a team of individuals to inspect and remove any harmful or abusive posts. Furthermore, algorithms are also used to detect and remove any abusive posts the individuals may have missed. Another method used by the anonymous app named Cloaq {{to reduce the number}} of harmful and abusive posts is by limiting the amount of users that can register during a certain period. Under this <b>system,</b> <b>all</b> <b>contents</b> are still available to the public, however only registered users can post.

40|$|Abstract. In a {{distributed}} system {{such as a}} Data Grid, it is desirable to maintain and query dynamic and timely information about active participants such as services, resources and user communities. This enables information discovery and collective collaborative functionality that operate on {{the system as a}} whole, rather than on a given part of it. However, it is not obvious how a database (registry) should maintain information populated from a large variety of unreliable, frequently changing, autonomous and heterogeneous remote data sources. In particular, how can one avoid sacrificing reliability, predictability and simplicity while allowing to express powerful queries over time-sensitive dynamic information? We propose the so-called hyper registry, which has a number of key properties. An XML data model allows for structured and semi-structured data, which is important for integration of heterogeneous content. The XQuery language allows for powerful searching, which is critical for non-trivial applications. Database state maintenance is based on soft state, which enables reliable, predictable and simple content integration from a large number of autonomous distributed content providers. Content link, content cache and a hybrid pull/push communication model allow {{for a wide range of}} dynamic content freshness policies, which may be driven by <b>all</b> three <b>system</b> components: <b>content</b> provider, hyper registry and client. Key words. Dynamic Database, XQuery, Service Discover...|$|R

This project focused on migrating the site to a social publishing application with the goals of automating as many tasks and processes as possible, and providing each user increased access to manage the content relevant to themselves. The existing content aggregation tools were deemed insufficient for the site's specific needs, and so information extraction techniques were researched in order to implement a custom solution for importing data from remote web sites. Throughout the project access logs and user statistics were kept to monitor changes in user behaviour as site changes were implemented. Additional feedback was solicited from users via surveys available throughout the development period, including questions tailored to their role within the community. Overall the site received positive feedback from users and traffic metrics increased throughout the duration of the project. Administrative effort was also reduced despite the increase in sit...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the behavior of}} a discrete-time multiserver buffer system with infinite buffer size. Packets arrive at the system according to a two-state correlated arrival process. The service times of the packets are assumed to be constant, equal to multiple slots. The behavior of the system is analyzed by means of an analytical technique based on probability generating functions (pgf's). Explicit expressions are obtained for the pgf's of the <b>system</b> <b>contents</b> and the packet delay. From these, the moments and the tail distributions of the <b>system</b> <b>contents</b> and the packet delay can be calculated.

The relationship is general {{in the sense that}} it doesn't require knowledge of the exact nature of the arrival process.
