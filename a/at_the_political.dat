5|$|The Countess {{was left}} rich under Leicester's will; yet the {{discharge}} of his overwhelming debts diminished her wealth. In 1604–1605 she successfully defended her widow's rights in court when her possessions and her good name were threatened by the Earl's illegitimate son, Robert Dudley, who claimed that he was his father's legitimate heir, thus implicitly declaring her marriage bigamous. Lettice Knollys was always close to her large family circle. Helpless <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> eclipse of her eldest son, the second Earl of Essex, she lost both him and her third husband to the executioner in 1601. From the 1590s she lived chiefly in the Staffordshire countryside, where, in reasonably good health until the end, she died at age 91 on Christmas Day 1634.|$|E
5|$|By 1960, Quwatli had quarreled with Nasser {{and criticized}} his {{policies}} in Syria. In particular, he condemned {{the institution of}} land distribution and industrial nationalization in July 1961, stating it would harm the economy severely. He was also personally affronted that his son-in-law Fayez al-Ujl had much of his property seized by the government {{as part of the}} socialist measures. Resentment towards the union across the spectrum of Syria's political class, social elite and officer corps was on the rise, with these key groups chafing at the centralization of authority into Nasser's hands, domination by a vastly larger Egypt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>political,</b> social and economic levels and the sidelining of these groups in the governance of Syria. The Syrian public also grew wary of the virtual police state set up in the country by Sarraj. A coup by secessionist officers was undertaken in Syria on 28 September, effectively breaking up the UAR. Quwatli lent his support toward the coup, aligning himself with the secessionist officers.|$|E

25|$|French's {{almost daily}} letters to his {{mistress}} in 1915 reveal his {{wish to see}} Kitchener sacked, his concern at lack of High Explosive shells, his ambivalent relations with the French (although sympathetic <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> interference which French generals suffered), his anger (shared with many other Western Front generals) at the way scarce men and shells were being sent to Gallipoli, and his belief that the German advance into Russia in 1915 would ultimately fail; he hoped that Germany would sue for peace {{by the summer of}} 1915 or spring 1916.|$|E
25|$|The {{split in}} the Irish Republican Army, soon {{followed}} by a parallel split in Sinn Féin, {{was the result of}} the dissatisfaction of more traditional and militant republicans <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> direction taken by the leadership. The particular object of their discontent was Sinn Féin's ending of its policy of abstentionism in the Republic of Ireland. This issue is a key one in republican ideology, as traditional republicans regarded the Irish state as illegitimate and maintained that their loyalty was due only to the Irish Republic declared in 1916 and in their view, represented by the IRA Army Council.|$|E

25|$|In the Spring of 1791, Jefferson and Congressman James Madison took a {{vacation}} to Vermont. Jefferson had {{been suffering from}} migraines and {{he was tired of}} Hamilton in-fighting. In May 1792, Jefferson was alarmed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> rivalries taking shape; he wrote to Washington, urging him to run for re-election that year as a unifying influence. He urged the president to rally the citizenry to a party that would defend democracy against the corrupting influence of banks and monied interests, as espoused by the Federalists. Historians recognize this letter as the earliest delineation of Democratic-Republican Party principles. Jefferson, Madison, and other Democratic-Republican organizers favored states' rights and local control and opposed federal concentration of power, whereas Hamilton sought more power for the federal government.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1780s, radicalism in Ireland {{was taking}} a new, bolder form, typified by the letters penned by William Drennan which were {{published}} in the Belfast Newsletter and in pamphlets. In them he hit out at leaders of the Volunteers such as Grattan and Charlemont for their conservatism and restraint, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> establishment for preventing the reform of the Irish parliament. Most notably was his appeal for all Anglicans, Dissenters, and Roman Catholics to unite as one indifferent association, however he accepted that this would only appeal to the minority within each denomination. Inspiring and increasing the radicalisation of Irish reformists was the French Revolution which had started in 1789, and had so far remained largely bloodless, with the French king forced to concede effective power to a National Assembly.|$|E
25|$|The {{plans were}} taken up to {{political}} level in 1987, {{when they were}} launched by the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications of the Norwegian Parliament. Due {{to the possibility of}} covering the investment costs through savings on operations, the committee asked the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications to prioritize the tunnel on their budget proposals. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> level, the Finse Tunnel had to compete with upgrades in Eastern Norway, where NSB was planning to launch the InterCity Express service. The government chose to try to delay the decision to build the Finse Tunnel until after 1990 so it could be considered along with other railway projects in a central plan. Calculations showed a benefit-cost ratio of 1.93, making it a highly profitable venture for the government. The Minister of Transport and Communications, Kjell Borgen, wanted to give priority to the new line from Ski to Moss. It was not until after the 1989 election that Parliament managed to pass the necessary priorities to start construction, which started in 1990.|$|E

500|$|From 1949 to 1953, Buendía {{worked for}} La Nación and met the magazine's {{secretary}} Dolores Abalos Lebrija, whom he married on 19 January 1955. Though he first wrote for La Nación, his professional journalistic career {{began at the}} newspaper La Prensa in 1953. He worked as an editor, crime reporter, and political columnist for the newspaper until he became the editor-in-chief in January 1960. Around that time Buendía started his daily column Red Privada ("Private Network"), where he wrote about the alleged collusion of organized crime in Mexico's political system. In 1963, he left {{to work at the}} newspaper El Día and wrote <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> column Para Control de Usted ("For You to Control") under the penname [...] "J.M. Tellezgirón".

500|$|Furthermore, the {{political}} elite of Aleppo, which was considerably more ethnically and religiously diverse than the almost entirely Arab Muslim-populated Damascus, was culturally closer to Turkish-Ottoman society, and numerous members of Aleppo's elite were of Turkic, Kurdish and Circassian descent. Because of these factors, many in Aleppo's political class {{did not support the}} 1916 Arab Revolt, and those who joined it felt that the revolt negatively exceeded their expectations because it ultimately ended Ottoman rule, and thus broke the bonds of Islamic unity and initiated the separation of Aleppo from its Anatolian hinterland. There was also resentment in Aleppo, which under Ottoman rule had been the administrative center of the Aleppo Vilayet (Province of Aleppo) and was equal to Damascus in political stature, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> dominance of Damascus under Faisal. While there were several Aleppines who held influential positions in Faisal's Damascus-based government, Faisal's leading political authorities in Aleppo were from Damascus or Iraq. However, French officials incorrectly believed that the rivalry between Aleppo and Damascus would make Aleppo's elite embrace French rule. Instead, according to historian Phillip S. Khoury, Aleppo [...] "vigorously resisted [...] occupation in order that its voice be heard in the new political climate." ...|$|E
