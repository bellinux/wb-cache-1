The aim {{of the study was to}} improve the survival rates of patients with low-grade glial tumors (LGT) (grade III-IV) by determining optimal treatment strategy and main prognostic survival factors. A prospective study of the results of treatment of patients with LGT from 2009 to 2014 was conducted. The study consistently included 100 operated patients with LGT (anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and glioblastoma (GLB)). The median survival in the total group of patients (n= 100) was 363. 5 days (12 months). The main statistically significant prognostic factors of survival were: the completeness of tumor removal (p= 0. 00000000007) and the character of adjuvant therapy (p= 0. 000012).

40|$|Background: Pancytopenia is a {{relatively}} common hematological entity. It is a striking feature of many serious and life-threatening illnesses, ranging from simple drug-induced bone marrow hypoplasia, megaloblastic anemia to fatal bone marrow <b>aplasias</b> and leukemias. The severity of pancytopenia and the underlying pathology determine the management and prognosis. Thus, identification of the correct cause will help in implementing appropriate therapy. Objectives: To study the clinical presentations in pancytopenia due to various causes; and to evaluate hematological parameters, including bone marrow aspiration. Materials and Methods: It was a prospective study, and 104 pancytopenic patients were evaluated clinically, along with hematological parameters and bone marrow aspiration in Hematology Unit, Department of Pathology, JJMMC, Davanagere, {{during the period of}} September 2005 to September 2007. Results: Among 104 cases studied, age of patients ranged from 2 to 80 years {{with a mean age of}} 41 years, and male predominance. Most of the patients presented with generalized weakness and fever. The commonest physical finding was pallor, followed by splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. Dimorphic anemia was the predominant blood picture. Bone marrow aspiration was conclusive in all cases. The commonest marrow finding was hypercellularity with megaloblastic erythropoiesis. The commonest cause for pancytopenia was megaloblastic anemia (74. 04 %), followed by aplastic anemia (18. 26 %). Conclusion: The present study concludes that detailed primary hematological investigations along with bone marrow aspiration in cytopenic patients are helpful for understanding disease process and to diagnose or to rule out the causes of cytopenia. These are also helpful in planning further investigations and management...|$|R
40|$|Acquired {{bone marrow}} failure syndromes (BMFS) are a {{heterogeneous}} group of hematological disorders characterized by impaired bone marrow function and subsequent cytopenia {{of one or}} more blood cell lineages [1, 2]. The well-accepted pathogenic mechanism of the typical bone marrow failure - aplastic anemia (AA) - is a T cell mediated immune attack targeting the hematopoietic tissue [3]. This pathogenic mechanism is at least partially shared by other bone marrow failure syndromes, such as lineage-restricted <b>aplasias</b> and some myelodysplastic syndromes. Thus, for these disorders immunosuppression (IS) is the pivotal etiologic treatment. While the standard IS regimen include the heterologous anti-thymocyte globulin [4], here we review the recent data on the anti-CD 52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab as a novel IS agent for marrow failures. Alemtuzumab led to objective responses in aplastic anemia patients in 3 recent prospective studies, with overall response rates ranging between 37 % and 72 %. Adverse events were irrelevant, ruling out even the concerns about the risk of infectious complications. Alemtuzumab was effective even for the treatment of lineage-restricted marrow failure, with very acceptable toxicity and excellent response rates (as high as 80 %). More recently, even patients suffering from myelodysplastic syndromes showed a remarkable hematological response to alemtuzumab-based IS treatment. Thus, alemtuzumab is a novel IS agent representing an excellent alternative to ATG for all immune-mediated marrow failure syndromes. Even if the dose and the schedule may still require further refining, the available data support the need of large prospective trials comparing alemtuzumab to current standard IS regimens...|$|R

40|$|Children {{developing}} an isolated {{central nervous system}} (CNS) relapse as first recurrence of their acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are considered to have a systemic relapse as well. They are mostly treated with intensive chemotherapy and craniospinal irradiation. In most treatment schedules, irradiation is given early after induction treatment. Because craniospinal irradiation affects {{a large portion of}} hematopoietic bone marrow systemically, treatment is often delayed owing to <b>aplasias.</b> Also, dose reductions are frequently needed. Children receiving simultaneously irradiation and chemotherapy are prone to (often severe) neurotoxicity. This study reports on children with a first isolated CNS relapse of their ALL receiving chemotherapy for 40 weeks. Treatment ends with the administration of irradiation given after cessation of chemotherapy. Fourteen children, with blasts and > 5 cells/mm(3) in two consecutive samples of cerebrospinal fluid and a blast percentage < 5 % in their bone marrow were treated according to an intensive systemic and site-specific chemotherapy. Craniospinal irradiation was administered after cessation chemotherapy. Event-free-survival was 57 % (confidence interval 35 - 89 %), freedom from relapse was 61. 5 %; follow-up ranges from 2. 0 to 15. 1 years (median 11. 7 years). One child died from septicemia during induction. Five children experienced a second relapse and died from their malignancy. Two children [with a t(9; 22) or a rearranged MLL gene] relapsed prior to radiotherapy. Outcome was related to duration of first remission, age at relapse, and identification as a high-risk patient at initial diagnosis. No neurologic complications were noted during and after treatment. Delayed irradiation for isolated CNS relapse in children with ALL gives favorable survival rates, without significant toxicity. Neurotoxicity was absen...|$|R
40|$|Intensive {{induction}} therapy-in acute {{myeloid leukemia}} (AML), as in some other systemic malignancies- is a strategy fundamentally different from post-remission strategies. Approaches like consolidation treatment, prolonged mainte&not;nance, and autologous or allogeneic transplantation in the first remission are directed against minimal residual disease with a malignant cell population having survived the induction treatment. In contrast, induction therapy deals with naive tumor cells possibly different in their sensitivity from their counterparts in remission. Therefore, in AML {{it has been suggested}} to introduce intensification strategies into the induction part of treatment as a new step after the preceding intensification steps in the post-remission part. As expected from the dose effects observed in post-remission treatment using more AraC or longer treatment, similar dose effects have been found in the induction treatment both by the incorporation of high-dose AraC and by the double induction strategy administered in patients up to 60 years of age. For example, patients with poor risk AML due to an unfavorable karyotype, high LDH in serum, or delayed response, benefited from double induction containing high-dose AraC by a longer survival as compared to that from standard dose AraC. A corresponding dose effect in the induction treatment has been found in patients of 60 years and older receiving daunorubicin 60 vs 30 mg/m 2 as part of the TAD regimen with higher dosage. This treatment significantly increased the response and survival rate in older patients who represented a poor risk group as a whole. Thus, we could demonstrate, both in younger and older patients, that a poor prognosis can be improved by a more intensive induction therapy. High-dose AraC in induction, however, exhibits a cumulative toxicity in that a repetition of courses containing high-dose AraC in the post-remission period is associated with considerable myelotoxicity leading to longlasting <b>aplasias</b> of about 6 weeks. However, after intensive induction treatment, high-dose chemotherapy in remission may become practicable using autologous stem cell rescue and may contribute to a further improvement of the outcome in poor risk as well as average patients with AML. These approaches are currently investigated by the German AMLCG. While there are clear limitations in the intensity of antineoplastic treatment for AML, as for other systemic malignancies, some further intensification may be possible and effective...|$|R
