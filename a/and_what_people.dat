5|$|In 1993, Riefenstahl was {{the subject}} of the award-winning German {{documentary}} film The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, directed by Ray Müller. Riefenstahl appeared in the film and answered several questions and detailed the production of her films. The biofilm was nominated for seven Emmy Awards, winning in one category. Riefenstahl, who for some time had been working on her memoirs, decided to cooperate in the production of this documentary to tell her life story about the struggles she had gone through in her personal life, her film-making career <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> thought of her. She was also the subject of Müller's 2000 documentary film , about her return to Sudan to visit the Nuba people.|$|E
500|$|Shilts accused Ronald Reagan of {{neglecting}} {{to address}} AIDS to the American people until 1987—calling his behavior [...] "ritualistic silence"—even after Reagan called friend Rock Hudson {{to tell him}} to get well. After Hudson's death and in the face of increasing public anxiety, Reagan directed Surgeon General C. Everett Koop to provide a report on the epidemic. Though Koop was a political conservative, his report was nevertheless clear about what causes AIDS <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> and the U.S. government should do to stop it, including sex and AIDS education provided for all people.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Spoonman" [...] {{is notable}} for {{featuring}} {{a performance by}} Artis the Spoonman, a street entertainer in Seattle. The title of the song is credited to bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam. While {{on the set of}} the movie Singles, Ament produced a list of song titles for the fictional band featured in the movie. Cornell took it as a challenge to write songs for the film using those titles, and [...] "Spoonman" [...] was one of them. An acoustic demo version of the song appears in the movie. Cornell said that the song is about [...] "the paradox of who [...] is <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> perceive him as".|$|E

500|$|On October 22, 2015, {{producer}} Malek Akkad {{expressed his}} wishes to postpone production {{for the new}} Halloween film and insists that the next iteration and the extra time {{will result in a}} better film. Malek said of Halloween Returns: [...] "Although, I have to say, and this is somewhat new news, but unfortunately things happen in Hollywood where you have issues with studios and different variables. We've had {{to take a step back}} and now we’re trying to re-figure this beast that is the new Halloween. So there is a bit of a delay, but this new Halloween isn't going to be quite what has been announced <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> are expecting, so we're making some changes there as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Falling Down" [...] {{is said to}} be {{in regards}} to accusations of {{wrongdoing}} and has a sense of longing for a non-benefiting relationship. However in an interview, Gomez stated, during an interview that the song ultimately is a ridicule of the Hollywood life and fame, that was the meaning behind [...] "Smile for the camera, 'cause they're all about to trash ya." [...] Gomez further elaborated on the concept of the song on an interview with Just Jared Jr., saying, It's basically about Hollywood <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> think about it and essentially how plastic it is sometimes. It's fun and I think girls can relate to it somewhat, for me it was because of Hollywood but it can really relate to a mean girl, an ex-boyfriend, to whoever.|$|E
2500|$|The {{back cover}} {{includes}} the following quote from Dr. Herbert Ley, a former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration who died three years before the book was written: [...] "The thing that bugs me is that people think the FDA is protecting them. It isn't. What the FDA is doing <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> think it's doing are as different as night and day." [...] The statement, extracted from a 1969 New York Times interview, {{was made in the}} context of Ley's resignation from his post as a result of numerous policy disputes. [...] Trudeau's lawyer, David J. Bradford, says that this quote does not constitute a false endorsement of the book by Ley, but rather is merely a statement that is in line with the purpose of the book.|$|E

2500|$|Like The Office, Parks and Recreation is filmed with a single-camera setup in a cinéma vérité style {{simulating}} {{the look}} of an actual documentary, with no studio audience or laugh track. Within {{the context of the}} show, the characters are being filmed by a documentary crew, the members of which are never seen or heard from on-screen. The actors occasionally look at and directly address the cameras, and in some scenes directly engage the cameras in one-on-one interviews with the documentary crew members. The episodes are scripted, but the production encourages the cast to improvise, and dialogue or performances the actors make up during filming often make the final cut of the episodes. Schur said he believes the mockumentary style is particularly fitting for a show about city government because, [...] "It's a device for showing the ways people act and behave differently when they're in public and private [...] the difference between what goes on behind closed doors <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> present to the public is a huge issue." ...|$|E

[...] "Or, perhaps, you took it away out of mischief?" [...] "Yes." [...] "And you broke the seal, {{and looked at the}} papers?" [...] "I dare say." [...] "And then you kept them hidden, thinking they might be of some use to you? Or perhaps feeling ashamed of what you had done, and meaning to restore them if you got the opportunity?" [...] "You know best, sir." [...] The same result followed when we tried to find out where he had been, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> had taken care of him, during his last vagrant escape from home.

60|$|I {{was anxious}} {{to see what was}} {{happening}} in the town <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> were talking of; but I thought it prudent not to venture out, for my disguise might be seen through, and if I were discovered I knew well what to expect. So I sat at home twiddling my thumbs and chattering with Andrea. At last, getting tired of doing nothing, and seeing the good woman about to scrub out her courtyard, I volunteered to do it for her. I got a broom and a pail of water and began sweeping away vigorously, while Andrea stood in the doorway scoffing. For a little while I forgot the terrible scene in the piazza.|$|E

Tigg Montague's cab dashed by them in Regent Street, more gorgeous than ever.

60|$|About a {{year after}} I arrived in Dunchester I was elected {{a member of the}} City Club. It is a {{pleasant}} place, where ladies are admitted to lunch, and I used it a good deal in the hope of making acquaintances who might be useful to me. Among the habitues of this club was a certain Major Selby, who, having retired from the army and being without occupation, was generally {{to be found in the}} smoking or billiard room with a large cigar between his teeth and a whisky and soda at his side. In face, the Major was florid <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> call healthy-looking, an appearance that to a doctor's eye very often conveys no assurance of physical well-being. Being a genial-mannered man, he would fall into conversation with whoever might be near to him, and thus I came to be slightly acquainted with him. In the course of our chats he frequently mentioned his ailments, which, as might be expected in the case of such a luxurious liver, were gouty in their origin.|$|E
