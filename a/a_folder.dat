5|$|Malware {{blocking}} {{and removal}} garnered good results in PC Magazine testing. All but one malware samples contained within <b>a</b> <b>folder</b> were removed once the folder was opened. The last one was removed when executed. Modifications {{made to the}} samples did not affect detection. On a similar test, specifically using commercial keyloggers, Norton did not successfully detect all. In removing threats, Norton almost completely removed 40 percent of the malware samples and related executables. Norton was also able to remove more commercial keyloggers than any other product.|$|E
5|$|Catherine's father, Tom Miller (Ken Pogue), tells Black {{about two}} {{friends of his}} whose son was convicted of killing his wife. The father, C. R. Hunziger, is dying of {{pancreatic}} cancer, but maintains his distance from his son over the crime; his wife Adele, however, still believes her son to be innocent. Black visits the terminal Hunziger, hoping to change his mind, but the elderly man holds his position. Adele gives Black <b>a</b> <b>folder</b> full of documents relating to the case, which Black reviews. His knowledge of offender profiling leads him {{to believe that the}} convicted man, Malcom, is innocent; however the conviction was secured with a substantial level of physical evidence.|$|E
5|$|Improved {{reliability}} for on-disk structures: ReFS uses B+ trees for all on-disk structures including metadata and file data. Metadata and file data are organized into tables {{similar to a}} relational database. The file size, number of files in <b>a</b> <b>folder,</b> total volume size and number of folders in a volume are limited by 64-bit numbers; as a result ReFS supports a maximum file size of 16 exabytes, a maximum of 18.4 × 1018 folders and a maximum volume size of 1 yottabyte (with 64 KB clusters) which allows large scalability with no practical limits on file and folder size (hardware restrictions still apply). Free space is counted by a hierarchical allocator which includes three separate tables for large, medium, and small chunks. File names and file paths are each limited to a 32 KB Unicode text string.|$|E
5000|$|Documents {{cannot be}} [...] "stored" [...] in <b>a</b> virtual <b>folder,</b> since {{physically}} <b>a</b> virtual <b>folder</b> is just <b>a</b> file storing a search query. Any attempt to store a file in <b>a</b> virtual <b>folder,</b> {{depending on the}} implementation, is redirected to some physical store.|$|R
25|$|There is {{also the}} ability to save {{searches}} as <b>a</b> Search <b>Folder</b> where opening the <b>folder</b> will execute <b>a</b> specific search automatically and display the results as <b>a</b> normal <b>folder.</b> <b>A</b> search <b>folder</b> is just <b>an</b> XML file which stores the search query, including the search operators as well. When these files are accessed, the search is run with the saved query string and the results presented as <b>a</b> virtual <b>folder.</b> Windows Vista also supports query composition, where a saved search (called a scope) can be nested within the query string of another search.|$|R
5000|$|... 9th Generation was {{designed}} by Jeff Siadek, and published by Jeff Siadek Enterprises in 1986 as a 36-page book, a 16-page book, and a 6-page book in <b>an</b> outer <b>folder,</b> <b>a</b> sample character sheet, a cardstock screen, and <b>an</b> outer <b>folder.</b>|$|R
5|$|In Washington, D.C., Agent Fox Mulder appears {{before an}} FBI panel {{regarding}} {{his experiences in}} Antarctica. Meanwhile, The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) reports to the Syndicate on the alien in Phoenix, confident that he'll be able to kill it. Assistant Director Walter Skinner tells Mulder, {{who is working on}} restoring the burned X-Files, that Mulder and Scully have been denied reassignment on the X-Files, but that Mulder should seek out <b>a</b> <b>folder</b> left on the desk in his old office. Mulder goes there, only to discover that Jeffrey Spender and Diana Fowley have been assigned to the X-Files. Feeling betrayed by Fowley, Mulder leaves, but not before stealthily taking the folder with him.|$|E
5|$|Watts (Terry O'Quinn) is {{a former}} FBI {{assistant}} director {{and a member of}} the Millennium Group. Watts is Black's initial mentor in the group, and they investigate cases together as partners. Although Watts' faith in the group is shaken when he discovers their responsibility for a deadly viral outbreak, he is reluctant to leave and fights Black's attempts to sabotage and expose the group's work. He convinces Emma Hollis to join the group, using a potential cure for her father's illness as leverage. After Watts leaks <b>a</b> <b>folder</b> of sensitive group documents to Black to aid his crusade, he is attacked in his home by an assassin from the group and presumed dead.|$|E

5000|$|In November 2006, Microsoft {{released}} Windows Vista {{which allows}} users to save any search query as <b>a</b> Search <b>Folder,</b> <b>a</b> type of virtual folder. Search Folders are designed so that users {{are not required to}} remember where their files are stored. <b>A</b> Search <b>Folder</b> is not <b>a</b> physical <b>folder,</b> but is essentially an XML file that stores a defined query in a form that can be used by the Windows Search subsystem. Because of this, <b>a</b> Search <b>Folder</b> can be created anywhere that <b>a</b> normal <b>folder</b> can be created. A similar approach exists in Windows XP when the Windows Indexing Service is enabled, as a search can be saved as a [...]fnd file. However, a saved search query in Windows XP only saves a user's search criteria; users must still specify the location and perform the search again as results are not dynamic.|$|R

As Imogen switches off the TV, the play ends.|$|E
25|$|Folders {{are updated}} to {{incorporate}} different pages, {{similar to the}} home screen layout, allowing for a significant expansion of folder functionality. Each page of <b>a</b> <b>folder</b> can contain up to nine apps, and there can be 15 pages in total, allowing {{for a total of}} 135 apps in a single folder.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} Linux distributions, {{including}} Red Hat Linux and Slackware's ZipSlack, provided a similar {{tool in the}} mid-1990s, using syslinux and the UMSDOS filesystem driver. Later, SuSE provided something similar using syslinux and loop-mounted disk images on FAT filesystems. During the late '90s BeOS used a similar system to install the OS in <b>a</b> <b>folder</b> in Windows.|$|E

25|$|Similarly to the Nintendo DSi, {{the menu}} has updateable firmware. On April 25, 2012, a system update brought the {{introduction}} of <b>a</b> <b>folder</b> system, which allows users to put applications inside folders. On June 20, 2013, a system update brought {{the introduction of}} the Save Data Backup feature, which allows the user to back up save data from downloadable Nintendo 3DS software and most Virtual Console games. An update was released on October 30, 2014 to enable players to download custom themes for the Home Menu, based on various Nintendo titles.|$|E
25|$|A {{directory}} {{table is}} a special type of file that represents a directory (also known as <b>a</b> <b>folder).</b> Since 86-DOS 0.42, each file or (since MS-DOS 1.40 and PCDOS 2.0) subdirectory stored within it is represented by a 32-byte entry in the table. Each entry records the name, extension, attributes (archive, directory, hidden, read-only, system and volume), {{the address of the}} first cluster of the file/directory's data, the size of the file/directory, and the date and (since PCDOS 1.1) also the time of last modification. Earlier versions of 86-DOS used 16-byte directory entries only, supporting no files larger than 16 MB and no time of last modification.|$|E
5000|$|Virtual folders, however, do not {{actually}} {{exist on the}} file system; they are instead presented through Windows Explorer as <b>a</b> tree of <b>folders</b> that the user can navigate. This {{is known as the}} Shell namespace. On Windows XP systems, the root of this namespace is the Desktop virtual folder, which contains the My Documents, My Computer, My Network Places (Network Neighborhood in Windows 95 and 98) and Recycle Bin virtual folders. Some virtual folders (like Desktop) have <b>an</b> accompanying special <b>folder</b> that is <b>a</b> reference to a directory on the physical file system. Windows Explorer displays the combined contents of <b>a</b> virtual <b>folder</b> and its associated file system folder to the user. This can be seen in Figure 1, which shows the Folder view in Windows XP's Explorer; in the Desktop virtual folder, the four standard virtual folders can be seen, as well as <b>an</b> additional <b>folder,</b> [...] "a folder on the desktop", which is <b>a</b> real <b>folder</b> located in the Desktop directory in the user's profile.|$|R

25|$|Internet Explorer 7 adds {{support for}} tabbed browsing, Atom, RSS, internationalized domain names, a search box, a {{phishing}} filter, an anti-spoofing URL engine, fine-grained control over ActiveX add-ons, thumbnails of all open tabs {{in a single}} window (called Quick Tabs), page zoom, and tab groups. Tab groups {{make it possible to}} open <b>a</b> <b>folder</b> of Favorites in tabs with a single click. Importing bookmarks and cookies from other web browsers is also supported. Additionally, there is now proper support for PNG images with transparency as well as improvements and fixes to CSS and HTML rendering. The Windows RSS Platform offers native RSS support, with developer APIs.|$|E
25|$|Plings {{are also}} used in Acorn RISC OS to denote an {{application}} directory: <b>a</b> <b>folder</b> that when double clicked executes a program file inside called !Run. Other files in the appfolder generally contain resources the application needs to run. The appfolder {{can be viewed as}} a normal folder by double-clicking with the shift key held down. In addition, other special resource files such as !Boot (executed the first time the application containing it comes into view of the filer), !Sprites (an icon file containing icon definitions loaded if !Boot cannot be found) and !Help (a text, HTML or other executable file listed in the filer menu for the application) also start with a pling.|$|E
25|$|Addenda and {{corrigenda}} sheet issued with Italy 1915–1919, Falls commissioned for {{the volume}} 1939 but resigned to take job with The Times {{and replaced by}} Wynne.

Wynne rewrote certain passages, adding some comments from Gough; Edmonds, Wynne and Gough corresponded during the writing which Wynne finished in 1946. Edmonds rewrote parts in 1948, correcting in a fourth draft what he judged to be errors by Wynne who declined to be named as author of the work. for reason of economy, there was no map case, large maps were supplied in <b>a</b> <b>folder</b> on the back cover.
