40|$|A {{generalization}} {{of the forest}} technique procedure [...] - the R^- 1 -operation [...] -is elaborated and then employed to treat a variety of problems. First, it is employed to reveal the underlying simple structure of the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk renormalization prescription based on momentum subtractions. Second, we use this structure to derive a generalized Zimmermann identity connecting two different renormalized versions of a given Feynman integral. Third, the recursive procedure to minimally subtract the ultraviolet and infrared divergences from euclidean, dimensionally regularized Feynman integrals [...] -the R^*-operation [...] - is simplified by reformulating {{it in terms of}} the R-operation alone. The new formulation is shown to lead immediately to a simple and regular algorithm for evaluating the overall ultraviolet divergences of arbitrary dimensionally regularized Feynman integrals, (including the ones appearing in two-dimensional field-theoretical models), the algorithm neatly reducing the problem to computing some massless propagator-type integrals. Finally, we construct a brief and concise proof of a general theorem which gives an explicitly finite large momenta and/or masses asymptotic expansion of an arbitrary (minimally subtracted) euclidean Feynman integral.

40|$|Appendix II - "Energy in the New Zealand environment" is only {{available}} to view with the <b>Archive</b> <b>copy</b> {{held in the}} Library. An increasing demand for energy in New Zealand has brought {{the country to the}} point where major decisions have to be made concerning energy supply. It was considered desirable by the Environmental Council that the New Zealand public be involved in making such decisions. The Council felt that information should be made available on the environmental implications of alternative energy development strategies. This project involved the preparation of a booklet on energy for the Environmental Council. The booklet was designed to present to the general public factual, easily accessible information on the environmental implications of energy development and use. The role of the booklet is placed in perspective by the examination of environmental education material prepared by New Zealand Government agencies. It is evident that some steps have been taken by Government to provide the public with information {{that could be used in}} decision-making concerning alternative energy futures. There remains a need for channels through which the public may effectively participate in decision-making. Objectives of environmental education are also discussed in the report. It is suggested that the concept of decision-making is central to environmental education. Accordingly, the role of environmental education in relation to resource management decision-making is examined...|$|E

40|$|We present {{optical and}} {{near-infrared}} (NIR) photometry for three gamma-ray burst supernovae (GRB-SNe) : GRB 120729 A, GRB 130215 A / SN 2013 ez and GRB 130831 A / SN 2013 fu. In {{the case of}} GRB 130215 A / SN 2013 ez, we also present optical spectroscopy at t-t 0 = 16. 1 d, which covers rest-frame 3000 - 6250 Angstroms. Based on Fe II (5169) and Si (II) (6355), our spectrum indicates an unusually low expansion velocity of 4000 - 6350 km/s, the lowest ever measured for a GRB-SN. Additionally, we determined the brightness and shape of each accompanying SN relative to a template supernova (SN 1998 bw), which were used to estimate the amount of nickel produced via nucleosynthesis during each explosion. We find that our derived nickel masses are typical of other GRB-SNe, and greater than those of SNe Ibc that are not associated with GRBs. For GRB 130831 A / SN 2013 fu, we use our well-sampled R-band light curve (LC) to estimate the amount of ejecta mass and the kinetic energy of the SN, finding that these too are similar to other GRB-SNe. For GRB 130215 A, we take advantage of contemporaneous optical/NIR observations to construct an optical/NIR bolometric LC of the afterglow. We fit the bolometric LC with the millisecond magnetar model of Zhang & Meszaros (2001), which considers dipole radiation {{as a source of}} energy injection to the forward shock powering the optical/NIR afterglow. Using this model we derive an initial spin period of P= 12 ms and a magnetic field of B= 1. 1 x 10 ^ 15 G, which are commensurate with those found for proposed magnetar central engines of other long-duration GRBs.

40|$|The bolometric {{properties}} (nickel mass, ejecta {{mass and}} kinetic energies) of 61 Ibc supernovae (SNe), including 20 Gamma-Ray Burst and X-Ray Flash (GRB/XRF), 19 Ib, 13 Ic and 9 Ic-BL (broad-lined) SNe are presented. All {{of the available}} $BVRI$ photometry in the literature have been collected and used in a new method that utilizes a template supernova (SN 1998 bw) and an analytical model based on Arnett (1982) to accurately estimate the bolometric properties of each SN. A statistical analysis of the bolometric properties is then performed, where {{it is found that}} GRB/XRF SNe are the most energetic, and eject more mass (including nickel content) than Ib, Ic and Ic-BL SNe. The results are then compared to the existing progenitor models of Ibc SNe, where it is concluded that it is highly likely that at least two progenitor channels exist for producing a Ibc SN: most Ibc SNe arise via binary interactions, where the mass of the stellar progenitor is less than what is attributed to a Wolf Rayet star. Conversely, the progenitors of Ic-BL and GRB/XRF are more massive than those of Ib and Ic SNe, though a key difference between them is progenitor metallicity, with Ic-BL SNe arise from more metal rich progenitors. As mass loss in massive stars is influenced by metal content, the progenitors of Ic-BL SNe lose more mass, and therefore more angular momentum, before exploding. It is expected that the explosion mechanism in Ic-BL and GRB/XRF SNe is ``engine-driven'' (i. e. an accreting black hole, or a millisecond magnetar), but the increased mass loss of Ic-BL SNe means the central engine is less powerful than in GRB/XRF SNe. Finally, it is found that the SNe that accompany GRBs and XRFs are statistically indistinguishable, and some mechanism other than metallicity is needed to explain the differences in the high-energy components in these events.

This is an <b>archive</b> <b>copy,</b> from September 2005, of the Japanese Performing Arts Resource Center prototype. The Global Performing Arts Consortium (GloPAC) is beginning to develop Performing Arts Resource Centers (PARCs), which combine scholarly content with technological sophistication to create interactive, innovative, and interpretive Web-based learning environments designed to advance the teaching and study of the performing arts. Each PARC will have a specific focus, which may be geographic (Japan), temporal (turn of the 20 th century), ethnic (Afro-American), thematic (feminist theatre), or audience oriented (teens). The resources on these sites will use individual materials that are stored and fully described in the Global Performing Arts Database (GloPAD), which will provide further opportunity for contextual research. The Japanese Performing Arts Resource Center (JPARC) contains resources {{for the study of}} the traditional theatres of Japan and is GloPAC's initial prototype PARC. It was originally developed in 1999 by Karen Brazell, GloPAC Director and Goldwin Smith Graduate Professor of Japanese Literature and Theatre at Cornell University; Monica Bethe, GloPAC consultant and Professor at Otani University, Tokyo; and Cornell student assistants Tang Fang ' 99, architecture; Mien Wang, BFA ' 99 in painting and printmaking; and Thomas Lento ' 00, Asian studies. Joshua Young and Kumiko McKee, GloPAC Research Associates, have added to and edited certain pages within the site since its initial set up. JPARC currently includes an interactive play script, a digital video of a biwa performance, a dynamic slide show on costuming, and a 3 -D noh stage, as well as a multi-layered glossary and an index of translations, and primarily focuses on noh theatre at this time. An advisory committee has been formed to develop a more sophisticated JPARC, one that incorporates more advanced technologies, in-depth scholarly content, and Japanese performance genre. This JPARC copy and the archiving of it was made possible through the support of Atlantic Philanthropies by way of a grant administered by J.
