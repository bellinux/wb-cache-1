40|$|International audienceThe {{friction}} and wear behaviour of {{several kinds of}} middle temperature abradable seal coatings used in aircraft turbine engine was investigated. Their <b>abradability</b> was evaluated by sliding worn volume. The mechanisms of the sliding wear of the coatings are abrasive wear, adhesive wear and oxidation wear, but {{the weight of the}} adhesive wear and abrasive wear is different in different coatings and under different test loads. The results show that the <b>abradability</b> decreases with the increase of the hardness for a given kind of coating. Even if the hardness is close, the <b>abradability</b> is very different in different kinds of coatings. So, only by the hardness can the level of <b>abradability</b> not be not judged and the coating not be chosen and designed. The <b>abradability</b> of M 313 type of coating is the best, M 310 is close to M 601 and M 307 with low hardness is fairly good, but M 307 with high hardness is the worst...|$|E

40|$|Major program {{objectives}} were the continued development of NiCrAlY feltmetal and honeycomb systems for knife edge seal {{applications in the}} 1144 to 1366 K temperature range, and to initiate abradable seal material evaluation for blade tip seal applications in the 1366 to 1589 K temperature range. Larger fiber size, higher density feltmetal showed greatly improved erosion resistance with a slight reduction in <b>abradability</b> compared to the baseline feltmetal. Pack aluminide coating of the honeycomb extended the oxidation resistance and slightly improved the <b>abradability</b> of this material. Evaluation through selected <b>abradability,</b> erosion and oxidation testing, and pertinent metallography led to selection of a plasma sprayed yttria stabilized zirconia (ZrO 2) /CoCrAlY layered system as the system with the most potential to meet the 1589 K requirement for blade tip seals.

40|$|International audienceThe {{results and}} {{development}} of a new full ceramic abradable turbine seal coating material prepared by thermal spraying are presented. The main objective was to achieve high temperature <b>abradability</b> and low mating part wear using an erosion-resistant coating with high temperature stability and thermal shock resistance. The new coating was successfully laboratory tested at temperatures of at least 1100 °C (2012 °F). Commercial metal-based abradable coatings which are currently available are limited to lower operating temperatures. Typical plasma- sprayed ceramic coatings, because of inherent high particle velocities, are normally to dense to permit abrading without experiencing high turbine blade tip wear damage. In contrast, lower velocity combustion-sprayed ceramic coatings frequently have lower toughness and cohesive particle strength for resistance to abrasive erosion. The new coating material is designed to react exothermically, during combustion spraying, to produce a coating both with high interparticle cohesive strength for resistance to abrasive particle erosion and with controlled porosity for low turbine blade tip wear and effective <b>abradability.</b> Adjustment of spraying conditions gives flexibility to alter the coating hardness and porosity and permits the tailoring of <b>abradability</b> and erosion resistance properties for specific operating requirements. Based on specially developed test methods for high temperature <b>abradability,</b> high temperature particle erosion and thermal cycling, the modified zirconia coating showed superior performance to high performance baseline materials tested in the program. Industrial evaluation of this coating is presently being conducted...|$|E

The scratch test behaviour was also correlated with the mechanical properties of the coatings (elastic modulus, microhardness and ultimate tensile strength). The results obtained were compared with those from industrial trials, to ascertain if the scratch test {{could be used as a}} relatively cheap and effective alternative to expensive engine trials. We have shown that the Progressive <b>Abradability</b> Hardness, abbreviated below as PAH, can be utilised as a measure of <b>abradability</b> in the scratch test, and can be related to the mechanical properties, in a manner consistent with engine test-bed findings. We have also found that the <b>abradability</b> and the PAH can change with scratch length due, we believe, to coating compression and densification ahead of the slider.

40|$|International audienceSince {{the real}} {{conditions}} at the blade tip and the casing in a gas-turbine engine present a complex (very high speed) deformation situation that is difficult and expensive to replicate, we have evaluated {{the use of a}} (low speed) standard scratch tester, as a means of assessing the performance of abradable coatings. Three proprietary plasma-sprayed coatings, Ni-graphite, Al–Si-graphite and Al–Si-polyester, were chosen for the tests. The scratch test behaviour was correlated with the mechanical properties of each coating (elastic modulus, microhardness and UTS (ultimate tensile strength)). Our results were compared with those from industrial trials, to ascertain if the scratch test {{could be used as a}} relatively cheap and effective alternative to expensive engine trials. We have shown that the " Progressive <b>abradability</b> hardness " (also called " specific grooving energy "), abbreviated below as " PAH", can be utilised as a measure of <b>abradability</b> in the scratch test, and can be related to the mechanical properties, in a manner consistent with engine test-bed findings. We have also found that the <b>abradability</b> and " PAH" can change with scratch length due to coating densification ahead of the slider, which is not easily revealed by other tests (such as the pendulum method).

40|$|A plasma sprayed dual density ceramic {{abradable}} seal system for direct {{application to the}} HPT seal shroud of small gas turbine engines. The system concept {{is based on the}} thermal barrier coating and depends upon an additional layer of modified density ceramic material adjacent to the gas flow path to provide the desired <b>abradability.</b> This is achieved by codeposition of inert fillers with yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) to interrupt the continuity of the zirconia struture. The investigation of a variety of candidate fillers, with hardness values as low as 2 on Moh's scale, led to the conclusion that solid filler materials in combination with a YSZ matrix, regardless of their hardness values, have a propensity for compacting rather than shearing as originally expected. The observed compaction is accompanied by high energy dissipation in the rub interaction, usually resulting in the adhesive transfer of blade material to the stationary seal member. Two YSZ based coating systems which incorported hollow alumino silicate spheres as density reducing agents were surveyed over the entire range of compositions from 100 percent filler to 100 percent YSZ. <b>Abradability</b> and erosion characteristics were determined, hardness and permeability characterized, and engine experience acquired with several system configurations...|$|E
40|$|The {{processing}} conditions, microstructural and tribological {{characterizations of}} plasma sprayed CoNiCrAlY-BN high temperature abradable coatings {{are reported in}} this manuscript. Plasma spray torch parameters were varied to produce a set of abradable coatings exhibiting {{a broad range of}} porosity levels (34 - 62 %) and superficial Rockwell hardness values (0 - 78 HR 15 Y). <b>Abradability</b> tests have been performed using an abradable-seal test rig capable of simulating operational wear at different rotor speeds and seal incursion rates. These tests allowed determining the rubbing forces and quantifying the blade and seal wear characteristics for slow and fast seal incursion rates. Erosion wear performance and ASTM C 633 coating adhesion strength test results are also reported. For optimal <b>abradability</b> performance, it is shown that coating hardness needs to be lower than 70 and 50 HR 15 Y for slow and fast blade incursion rate conditions, respectively. It is shown that the erosion wear performance, as well as, the coating cohesive strength {{is a function of the}} coating hardness.

30|$|The {{tribological}} {{behaviors of}} {{two types of}} seal coatings, nickel–graphite and aluminum–hexagon-boron nitride (Ni–Cg and Al–hBN, respectively) versus a Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade used in turbofan engines were investigated using a high-speed rubbing test. The wear status and damage mechanism of the friction couples were studied and the <b>abradability</b> of the seal coatings was evaluated. By analysis of the coating properties and damage mechanism of the seal couple, the friction heat effect was identified as the key factor influencing blade wear forms as well as coating <b>abradability.</b> A one-dimensional heat conduction model was established to estimate the effect of increasing temperature on the friction interface. The results indicated that in the Ni–Cg and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V seal couple, the temperature rising rate (TRR) of the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade was faster {{than that of the}} Ni–Cg coating, and so the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade softened earlier than the Ni–Cg coating, causing the blade to suffer severe wear. In the Al–hBN and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V seal couple, the TRR of the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade was slower than that of the Al–hBN coating, and so the Al–hBN coating softened first; thus, blade damage was reduced or even replaced by coating adhesion. The square root ratio of thermal diffusivity between the blade and the coating could be taken as an indicator of the ratio of TRR between the blade and coating to predict blade wear status as well as damage mechanism. The results of the model agreed well with the experiment results of the two seal couples used in this study.|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} in this paper {{that the role of}} surface and near-surface plastic {{deformation}} is especially significant in both sliding and abrasive wear of lamellar composites. Lamellar structures were produced artificially from alternate layers of pure copper and pure tin or lead foils.

In each case the counterface was a hard alloy steel. Tests were run with the composite lamellae in two orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the sliding direction.

40|$|Experimental {{evaluation}} under simulated engine conditions {{revealed that}} conventional mainshaft seals have disadvantages of high gas leakage rates and wear. An advanced seal concept, the self-acting face seal, {{has a much}} lower gas leakage rate and greater pressure and speed capability. In endurance tests (150 hr) to 43 200 rpm the self-acting seal wear was not measurable, indicating noncontact sealing operation was maintained even at this high rotative speed. A review of published data revealed that the leakage through gas path seals has {{a significant effect on}} TSFC, stall margin and engine maintenance. Reducing leakages by reducing seal clearances results in rubbing contact, and then the seal thermal response and wear determines the final seal clearances. The control of clearances requires a material with the proper combination of rub tolerance (<b>abradability)</b> and erosion resistance. Increased rub tolerance is usually gained at the expense of reduced erosion resistance and vice versa...|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 95 - 102 The use of {{abradable}} and rub tolerant polymer seals {{to reduce}} leakage between rotating and stationary members in centrifugal compressors and steam turbines has {{increased over the}} years. Abradable materials such as mica-filled tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), nickel graphite, and aluminum alloy containing silicon/polyester are {{the most commonly used}} and have gained acceptance in the marketplace. This paper highlights the development of anew abradable silicon rubber adhesively bonded to a metal substrate. The <b>abradability</b> of the material was found to be excellent with no damage to the rotating member. For rub tolerant polymer seals little data are available on the effects of an aggressive rub with relation to deflection and wear at various temperatures. A series of test was done on labyrinth seals manufactured from various forms of carbon fill polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polyamideimide (PAI). these test evaluated their mechanical performance at low temperatures, room temperatures, and high temperatures. The results of the tests indicated that at room temperature and low temperatures, the seals exhibited acceptable deflection properties without damage to the rotating shaft and minimal material loss from the labyrinth teeth. However, at high temperatures of 150 ?F, the PAI material had greater deflection values than the two types of PEEK, which resulted in the PAI exhibiting greater tooth height loss compared to the PEEK materials.

Thermally sprayed abradable seals {{have been used in}} the compressor section of jet engines since the late 1960 s. These seals are predominantly coatings made from composite material that derive their <b>abradability</b> from the use of low shear strength materials or form a porous, friable coating structure. Due to the extreme temperatures on the turbine side of gas turbine engines, brazed or welded metallic structures made from nickel (Ni) based alloys have typically been used to provide gas path sealing. When thermal shock resistant ceramics because available, oxide ceramic, mostly zirconia based high temperature abradable seals for the high pressure turbine stages were developed. For the highest temperature stages, thermally sprayed oxide ceramics with or without metallic strain isolators are frequently used. On stages with reduced temperatures both ceramic and metallic coatings of the McrA 1 Y type can be used. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in compressor and turbine clearance control materials and systems, whereby a focus is placed on novel thermally sprayed ceramic turbine seals with encouraging property combinations, which are achieved by the introduction of alternative stabilizers.

40|$|In aero-engines it is {{possible}} for the blades of the compressor, turbine or fan to incur into their casings. At these interfaces a lining of composite abradable material is used to limit damage to components and thereby sustain the efficiency and longevity of the engine as a whole. These composite materials must have good <b>abradability</b> and erosion resistance. Previously, the wear mechanisms at the contact between the blade and the coating have been characterised using stroboscopic imaging and force measurement on a scaled test-rig platform. This work is focused on the characterisation of the wear mechanism for two different hardnesses of abradable lining. The established stroboscopic imaging technique and contact force measurements are combined with sectioning of the abradable material in order to analyse the material’s response during the tests. A measure of the thermal properties and the resulting temperature of the linings during the test have also been made to further understand the effect of coating hardness. The wear mechanism, material response, contact force and thermal properties of the coating have been used to characterise the different material behaviour with different hardness. At low incursion rates, with a soft coating, the blade tip becomes worn after an initial adhesive transfer from the coating. Post-test sectioning showed blade material and significant compaction present in the coating. The harder coating produced adhesion on the blade tip with solidification observed in the coating. Thermal diffusivity measurements and modelling indicated that thermally driven wear observed was {{as a consequence of the}} increased number of boundaries between the metal and hBN phases present interrupting heat flow, leading to a concentration of surface heat. At higher incursion rates, the wear mechanism is more similar between the coatings and a cutting mechanism dominates producing negligible adhesion and blade wear. ...|$|E

They address {{the results of the}} foam concrete modeling technology and assess the importance of technology-related parameters. Reinforcement efficiency criteria are also provided in the article. Dispersed reinforcement improves the plasticity of the concrete mix and reduces the settlement crack formation rate. Conventional reinforcement that involves metal laths and rods demonstrates its limited application in the production of concrete used for thermal insulation and structural purposes. Dispersed reinforcement is preferable. This technology contemplates the infusion of fibres into porous mixes. Metal, polymeric, basalt and glass fibres are used as reinforcing components. It has been identified that products reinforced by polypropylene fibres demonstrate substantial <b>abradability</b> and deformability rates even under the influence of minor tensile stresses due to the low adhesion strength of polypropylene in the cement matrix. The objective of the research was to develop the type of polypropylene of D 500 grade that would demonstrate the operating properties similar to those of Hebel and Ytong polypropylenes. Dispersed reinforcement was performed by the basalt fibre. This project contemplates an autoclave-free technology to optimize the consumption of electricity. Dispersed reinforcement is aimed at the reduction of the block settlement in the course of hardening at early stages of their operation, the improvement of their strength and other operating properties. Reduction in the humidity rate of the mix is based on the plasticizing properties of fibres, as well as the application of the dry mineralization method. Selection of optimal parameters of the process-related technology was performed with the help of G-BAT- 2011 Software, developed at Moscow State University of Civil Engineering.
