40|$|Nowadays, {{the issue}} of {{sustainability}} becomes an important topic not only for countries, but also regions. A specific example is a group <b>autonomous</b> <b>regions</b> located in strategic areas and influencing countries' economic and political performance. The research problem discussed in this paper is the influence and measurement of sustainable development on competitiveness of <b>autonomous</b> <b>regions.</b> The author focuses on the application of sustainable development in <b>autonomous</b> <b>regions,</b> factors influencing their performance, {{and the impact of}} sustainability on these factors. Based on literature review regarding competitiveness indicators with the reference to sustainability suggestions are made for new competitiveness indicators for these regions. In the paper, the author first examines sustainable conflict resolution schemes for <b>autonomous</b> <b>regions</b> at war. Then, aspects of Sustainable Competitiveness Index by World Economic Forum are presented and analyzed with regard to <b>autonomous</b> <b>regions.</b> The paper finishes with a proposal of new indicators...|$|R

5|$|After Prapiroon dissipated, the {{regional}} Disease Prevention and Control Center of Guangxi <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Region</b> sent out eight teams of health workers to help avoid epidemics in affected areas.

The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement sought for $4,825,791 (2006USD) in funds to assist 240,000 people who were affected over a 12-month span. Reconstruction in the areas devastated by Prapiroon began shortly after the typhoon dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Chinese paleontologists {{discovered}} a partial skull and {{skeleton of a}} small theropod (IVPP V4878) in the Xinjiang <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Region</b> of China in the mid-1960s. In 1977, Dong Zhiming described this specimen, which was recovered from the Subashi Formation in Shanshan County, as a new genus and species, Shanshanosaurus huoyanshanensis. Gregory Paul recognized Shanshanosaurus as a tyrannosaurid in 1988, referring it to the now-defunct genus Aublysodon. Dong and Currie later re-examined the specimen and deemed {{it to be a}} juvenile of a larger species of tyrannosaurid. These authors refrained from assigning it to any particular genus but suggested Tarbosaurus as a possibility.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, E was {{spoken by}} about 30,000 people, but by 2008 this number had dwindled to 9,000. Most E {{speakers}} {{are classified as}} Zhuang by the Chinese government. E speakers live primarily in the Guangxi <b>autonomous</b> <b>region</b> of China, specifically in the Rongshui Miao county and border areas of Luocheng Mulao. Villages inhabited by E speakers include Xiatan, Simo, Xinglong, and the Yonglei district. Ethnologue classifies E as rank 6b (Threatened). E speakers' most commonly spoken other languages are Yue Chinese and the Guiliu variant of Southwestern Mandarin.|$|E
5|$|In Tibet, {{the species}} {{has been found}} in the northeastern Tibet <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Region</b> in the Chamdo Prefecture; and in the {{southeast}} of the region in Tse (in December) and in Dzeng (in April), both in the South Tibet (Tsangpo) Valley region. The Tsangpo Valley sightings may be anomalous, only indicating winter visitation. The bird observed in Dzeng was in an environment alien to the species' normal coniferous forest environs, and both the Dzeng and Tse individuals had atypically pale underparts, indicating they may have been nominate S. leucopsis, but with genetic introgression traits from Przevalski's nuthatch.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of Hurricane Beta, the U.S. {{ambassador}} to Nicaragua signed a disaster declaration on October28, prompting the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to send aid. Before the storm hit, $200,000 {{was sent to}} the country for emergency relief supply distribution and helicopter fuel. On November1, USAID and OFDA airlifted 200 rolls of plastic sheeting, 5,020 ten-litre water containers, and 2,736 hygiene kits, valued at $120,877. Another $22,000 was used to supply an aircraft and Bell 204/205 helicopter to assist affected areas. On November10, another $100,000 was sent for sanitation and health activities. The United Nations sent $10,000 to the South Caribbean Coast <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Region</b> to cover emergency needs. Forty-five tents were sent to communities in need. The Spanish Government also sent $377,188 in aid and to Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus {{is known}} from three {{specimens}} {{collected in the}} lowlands of the South Caribbean Coast <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Region</b> in southeastern Nicaragua. The first, an old male, was collected on November5, 1904, in a banana plantation with very moist red clay on the Río Escondido near El Rama. The second, a young adult male, was caught on July26, 1966, in dense cane on the south bank of the Río Mico at El Recreo, 15km (9mi) west from {{the location of the}} first specimen, along with three other rice rats (O.couesi, Melanomys caliginosus, and Oligoryzomys fulvescens), the cotton rat Sigmodon hirsutus, and the cottontail rabbit Sylvilagus brasiliensis. The third was caught at a stream near Bluefields. Reid suggested that the species is semiaquatic, spending some time in the water, like other Oryzomys.|$|E
