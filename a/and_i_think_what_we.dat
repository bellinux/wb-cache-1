[...] "Where all did well there were two who chiefly helped us to win what we have done, and it is to our sorrow that one goes back to his own country now that his work is well accomplished. We will not lightly forget him. The other will, I hope, be spared to stay with you and share your triumphs as he has done your adversity. I have to {{announce}} my daughter's approaching marriage to your comrade, Henry Ormesby." ...|$|E
5000|$|Albarn {{described}} the sessions as [...] "putting things together that didnt work. We {{made a lot}} of mistakes but the ones that we thought worked we kept and put on the album. Theres still a few that Id like to have seen on the record, but it would have turned into a different record. Cause {{a lot of the other}} stuff was probably a bit rawer but still really interesting. The record may have been a double album and youd have had the laid back side and the more kind of fractious, difficult side <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted was to find the balance between those two." ...|$|E

5000|$|Landecker {{defended the}} casting by saying, “This show is great {{in large part}} because of him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> Jill tried to do — look, the truth is: he’s one of the {{greatest}} actors, he wanted to play this, she Soloway feels connected to him, the character’s also pre-transition when we start the show.” ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Deutsche Welle on September 8, 2016, Gutierrez explained, [...] "If you don't regulate the immigration, if you don't structure our communities, {{we are going to}} do whatever we want. We are going to take over. That is what I'm trying to say <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> is happening with my culture is that its imposing itself on the American culture - and both cultures are reacting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you! Clarence {{was not in}} a {{condition}} to notice anything very clearly during his journey, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> he suffered blunted his recollection. Besides, the subject is a distressing one to him, and it is seldom he can be induced to speak about it. Perhaps that is a pity; I find it does not always save one trouble in the end to avoid a little immediate pain." ...|$|R
5000|$|For 40,000 years Hanging Rock {{has brought}} people together, and Miranda {{and the film}} and the book {{are all part of}} that story. But a {{significant}} part of that story was to understand the Indigenous history and further investigate the Indigenous name ... We focus on one aspect of popular culture around Hanging Rock, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> Amy is trying to do is tell a broader story, and we certainly support that.|$|R
500|$|... "The thing is, I always saw Madonna as a {{performance}} artist. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to portray was the process {{about how a}} performer arrives at their work. And the thing is, what she had talked about as well, is that before a concert, what she finds very interesting is the rehearsals and the straining and maybe {{she would like to}} injure. [...] And she said that the process of making the concert became more intriguing than the final result." ...|$|R

5000|$|In another interview, Vedder stated:These attitudes out there...that it's the industry's music... And it's not. It's mine. And it's yours. Whoever's {{listening}} to it. It's mine and it's yours. And everybody in between, they're the distributors. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{that something like}} a music channel can be very powerful. Sometimes they think they're the ones who decide <b>what's</b> heard. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's a dangerous situation. <b>And,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>what's</b> more dangerous is that they think it belongs to them. That's probably what [...] "Not for You" [...] is about.|$|R
5000|$|Blessy Chettiar in her {{review on}} Daily News and Analysis {{asserted}} the author used [...] "flowery language" [...] {{in the novel}} to depict Nikki's daily experiences. The review claimed the language used is [...] "not necessarily enlightening". She concluded, [...] "Not insightful even by a long shot, Bollywood Striptease is only a tease, telling and re-telling what you already know." [...] Actress Riya Sen, who launched the book, claimed the novel exposes the inside of Bollywood, saying, [...] "This book has everything <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> she has written is true." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "But we're always {{concerned}} {{with the quality of}} the tune; just writing crazy music isn't enough, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>what</b> makes us different from other bands who go really technical. We're definitely writing songs." ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite being openly gay, he {{does not}} {{consider}} his sexuality to be a focal part of his act, once saying, [...] "I just think gay people need to get over themselves. Just because you're gay and on the telly doesn't mean you're a role model. I'm just a comedian. That's all I am. What am I meant to do? Do I go down the Julian Clary route and talk about fisting <b>and</b> poppers? <b>I</b> don't talk about being gay <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> better equality for gays than that?" [...] In September 2016, Carr announced his engagement to his long-term partner Paul Drayton.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2014, the British {{parliamentary}} Public Accounts Committee interviewed Kevin Nicholson (head of {{tax division}} in PwC UK) {{for the second}} time in two years. Margaret Hodge, the chairwoman of the committee, accused Nicholson of having lied in the first hearing before LuxLeaks. She said: [...] "It's very hard for me to understand that this is anything other than a mass-marketed tax avoidance scheme," [...] and [...] "I think there are three ways in which you lied <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> you are doing is selling tax avoidance on an industrial scale."Nicholson denied that PwC mass-marketed tax avoidance schemes.|$|R
5000|$|In a 2015 Fox Business interview, Spitznagel said: Great myths die hard. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> we’re {{witnessing}} {{today is}} the slow death {{of one of the}} great myths in human history: this idea that centrally planned command economies work, that they’re even feasible, and that they can be successful. It’s one of these enigmatic mythologies of the last hundred years in particular that we've been grappling with. Let’s remember that in the last hundred years a lot of blood has been shed over this mythology. And here we are today, how did we get here again? ...|$|R

[...] "But the fact is, gentlemen in a county like this always want to have everything done for them, and never {{to do anything for}} themselves. I'm sick of it, I know. Nobody is fonder of hunting a country than <b>I</b> am, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> I'm about." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “When I was invited, they’re like ‘It’s not a show, it’s not a presentation,’—she said ‘It’s an experience!’” shared Coco Rocha. “Everyone is {{definitely}} amused {{and the girls}} are just smiling <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s <b>what</b> fashion should be.” ...|$|R
5000|$|In his {{obituary}} for John Buller in the Guardian, Martin Wainwright wrote, '...John's {{discovery of}} Joyce fuelled him {{for most of}} his creative life, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> became fundamental to everything he composed was the Joycean notion that imagination is nothing but extended memory, that the commonplace of our musical or aural consciousness is virtually infinite, so that the task of the composer is {{to go down to the}} elements of musical consciousness and reorder them. His voice, in everything, came from this vision, and maybe that is why it embraced a wider than usual range of idioms and contrasts, including popular elements.' ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{described}} {{his time in}} the military as [...] "a very mild deployment" [...] as a Public Affairs Officer. He said that he wrote his collection of short stories based on his service and return to civilian life because: ...what I really want — <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> a lot of veterans want — is a sense of serious engagement with the wars, because it's important, because it matters, because lives are at stake, and it's something we did as a nation. That's something that deserves to be thought about very seriously and very honestly, without resorting to the sort of comforting stories that allow us to tie a bow on the experience and move on.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} chatting {{with him a}} bit," [...] Ralph said. [...] "He has never been to school, but has been brought up at home, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> from <b>what</b> {{he said he is}} the heir to an estate. He seemed rather to look down upon schools." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “They {{definitely}} get you noticed,” declared Cat Deeley. “I {{love her}} appreciation of color. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it’s beautiful <b>and</b> for me they fit my body; they {{look good on}} me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s <b>what</b> it’s all about. It’s about knowing your own body and knowing what suits you.” ...|$|R
5000|$|.....<b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it really}} came {{and out of}} though - {{it came out of}} some guy of Washington DC, that used to be with the CIA or FBI or {{something}} that was in the encryption game. He decided he wanted to do some kind of album cover, and he started talking to Steve O'Rourke, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> happened was Steve O'Rourke had in his brilliant mind {{that he was going to}} try something on the internet because he had been listening to me. And he got this guy, cause if you notice a lot of this stuff can't be traced where it comes from. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> know that Dave for one thing didn't even know how to sign on." ...|$|R
500|$|... "So {{the real}} thing is, let's get some really wise heads {{together}} {{and figure out how}} you want to deal with the interim and long-term storage.

5000|$|... "The {{only thing}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> really don't like that much is [...] "The Perfect Drug" [...] song. It {{was one of}} those things where you have a week to do a track for a movie, the mindset that you kind of adapt in that situation, or I did, was 'let's go in and {{experiment}} and see what happens, and it's not, y'know, whatever comes out of it, it's not the end of the world'. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> came out of it, married with a bloated, over-budget video, feels like ... the least thing that I would play to somebody if they said play me, y'know, the top hundred songs you've written, that probably wouldn't be in the top hundred. I'm not cringing about it, but it's not my favorite piece." ...|$|R

5000|$|.....<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s <b>what</b> {{you might}} hear {{separating}} it from The Movement, {{because this is}} a concentrated effort of O.C. and A.G.…more so than any other project because you hear us here and there. This is constantly us. There is no features on there. It’s just us." [...] explains A.G. in an interview.|$|R
5000|$|Going {{into the}} Olympic Games we weren't the {{overwhelming}} favorites {{to win the}} gold medal. We weren't even considered the strongest team in the tournament.
