5|$|The A1 route was {{designated}} in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme. Through the inner boroughs of the City, Islington, and Haringey it uses existing roads and streets; {{when it reaches}} {{what is now the}} outer London borough of Barnet, some stretches of purpose-built new roads were built, and others have been widened and made into dual carriageways. In 1828, John Benjamin Macneill, chief engineer to Thomas Telford, used Roman cement and gravel to solve problems with wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> the Archway Road section of what is now the A1, an innovative technique that was used there for the first time, and is the basis for modern road building.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two basic}} {{aerodynamic}} models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that creates a spiralling leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling and clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, {{at the price of}} wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> the wings.|$|E
5|$|De Soto {{continued}} her patrols in the Gulf of Mexico into {{the month of}} August, braving the sweltering heat to board and inspect coastal and seaborne traffic. The steamer Alice Vivian was seized on 16 August, as she had no papers, and the steamer Nita was taken the next day for the same reason. During this month, wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> the steamer's boilers began to show and, despite attempts at repair, De Soto steadily lost speed. On 12 September, following a nine-hour chase under steam and sail, the Union ship finally took the blockade runner Montgomery, a chase Capt. Walker claimed should have taken one fourth the time if the boilers were in good order. Tinkering helped build up steam pressure to a point, and De Soto managed to chase down the screw steamer Leviathan on 22 September.|$|E

25|$|The council {{are also}} {{concerned}} about wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> the bridge as, although no longer on a major road, it still carries significant traffic.

25|$|The ballast {{also serves}} as a means of drainage. Some more modern track in special areas is {{attached}} by direct fixation without ballast. Track may be prefabricated or assembled in place. By welding rails together to form lengths of continuous welded rail, additional wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> rolling stock caused by the small surface gap at the joints between rails can be counteracted; this also makes for a quieter ride (passenger trains).|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} prevent tool {{fracture}} and to minimize excessive wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> the tool and associated machinery, the welding cycle is modified so that the forces acting on the tool are as low as possible, and abrupt changes are avoided. In order {{to find the best}} combination of welding parameters, it is likely that a compromise must be reached, since the conditions that favour low forces (e.g. high heat input, low travel speeds) may be undesirable {{from the point of view}} of productivity and weld properties.|$|E

With insufficient numbers of Bf 109 aircraft to equip the formation they 'borrowed' aircraft from II./JG 11 (at Rheine) and III./JG 11 (at Oldenburg). Operating aircraft by day and also by night the extra wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> their aircraft and resulting lower serviceability rates made the arrangement very unpopular with the JG 11 maintenance personnel.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the change}} of the country's name to Myanmar on 20 June 1989, new notes began to be issued, but {{returning}} to more useful or practical denominations. This time, the old notes were not demonetised, but simply allowed to fall into disuse through inflation as well as wear <b>and</b> <b>tear.</b> <b>On</b> 1 March 1990, 1-kyat notes were issued, followed by 200-kyat notes on 27 March 1990. On 27, March 1994, notes for 50 pya, 20, 50, 100, and 500 kyats were issued, followed on 1 May 1995, by new 5- and 10-kyat notes. 1,000-kyat notes were introduced in November 1998.|$|E
25|$|Insects are {{the only}} group of {{invertebrates}} that have evolved wings and flight. Two insect groups, the dragonflies and the mayflies, have flight muscles attached directly to the wings. Other insects have the flight muscles attached to the thorax, making it oscillate and indirectly causing the wings to beat. Some very small insects make use not of steady-state aerodynamics but of the Weis-Fogh clap and fling mechanism, generating large lift forces {{at the expense of}} wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> the wings. Many insects can hover, maintaining height and controlling their position. Some insects such as moths have the forewings coupled to the hindwings so these can work in unison.|$|E

25|$|The roads have {{reverted to}} their {{previous}} 'heavily restricted' status. There is still considerable car traffic {{into and out}} of the park, mainly of families with children, dog walkers, kite/model aeroplane fliers and other recreational use. However, cross-park 'through traffic' is now completely blocked by sturdy gates across the main link roads, similar to the existing gates at all road entrances and exits, that open and close with dusk and dawn. This measure has significantly reduced the use of the park as a rush-hour short-cut (notably between Boldmere and Streetly), with some noticeable impact on congestion of local routes around the Park. The benefit of traffic restriction is improvement in the enjoyability of the park; with cleaner air, safer roads for walkers and cyclists, and much reduced visual and noise pollution, plus reduced wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> the poorly maintained, decaying road surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Insect {{flight is}} {{considerably}} different, {{due to their}} small size, rigid wings, and other anatomical differences. Turbulence and vortices play a much larger role in insect flight, making it even more complex and difficult to study than the flight of vertebrates. There are two basic aerodynamic models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that creates a spiralling leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling-and-clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, {{at the price of}} wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> the wings.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the case}} {{is the single most}} {{expensive}} part of a loaded round, the more times a case can be re-used, the better. Cases that are loaded to a moderate pressure will generally last longer, as they will not be work hardened or flow under pressure as much as cases loaded to higher pressures. Use of moderate pressure loads extends the life of the case significantly, not to mention saving quite a bit of wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>on</b> the barrel. Work hardening can cause cracks to occur in the neck as the hardened brass loses its malleability, and is unable to survive swaging back into shape during the resizing operation. Rifle brass tends to flow towards the neck (this is why rifle brass must be trimmed periodically) and this takes brass away {{from the rear of the}} case. Eventually, this will show as a bright ring near the base of the cartridge, just in front of the thick web of brass at the base. If brass is used after this ring appears, it risks a crack, or worse, a complete head separation, which will leave the forward portion of the brass lodged in the chamber of the gun. This generally requires a special stuck case removal tool to extract, so it is very undesirable to have a head separation.|$|E

5|$|An {{individual}} {{killer whale}} {{can often be}} identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, <b>and</b> <b>tears</b> <b>on</b> the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.|$|R
