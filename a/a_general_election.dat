5|$|Each {{parliament}} {{lasts for}} {{a maximum of}} five years from the date of its first sitting, and once a parliament has been dissolved <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election</b> must be held within three months. Following <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election,</b> the President appoints as Prime Minister an MP who, in his judgment, is likely to command {{the confidence of the}} majority of the MPs. In practice, the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the political party holding the majority of the seats in Parliament. The President also appoints other Ministers from among the MPs, acting in accordance with the Prime Minister's advice.|$|E

5|$|It is the {{prerogative}} of the monarch to summon and prorogue Parliament. Each parliamentary session {{begins with the}} monarch's summons. The new parliamentary session is marked by the State Opening of Parliament, during which the Sovereign reads the Speech from the throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords, outlining the Government's legislative agenda. Prorogation usually occurs about one year after a session begins, and formally concludes the session. Dissolution ends a parliamentary term, and is followed by <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election</b> for all seats in the House of Commons. <b>A</b> <b>general</b> <b>election</b> is normally held {{five years after the}} previous one under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, but can be held sooner if the Prime Minister loses a motion of confidence, or if two-thirds {{of the members of the}} House of Commons vote to hold an early election.|$|E

5|$|A Non-constituency Member of Parliament ("NCMP") is a {{candidate}} of an opposition political party who, despite having lost in <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election,</b> is declared elected as a Member of the Parliament of Singapore ("MP") by virtue of provisions in the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act enabling the unsuccessful candidates who have performed the best to be accorded the status. The MP is so called {{because he or she}} does not represent any constituency (or electoral division) in Parliament.|$|E
50|$|In Sri Lanka, a Member of Parliament {{refers to}} a member of the Parliament of Sri Lanka (since 1978), the National State Assembly (1972-78) and the House of Representatives of Ceylon (1947-72), the lower house of the Parliament of Ceylon. Members are elected in <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>elections</b> or {{appointed}} from the national lists allocated to parties (and independent groups) in proportion to their share of the national vote at <b>an</b> <b>general</b> <b>election.</b> <b>A</b> candidate to become an MP must be a Sri Lankan citizen and not hold dual-citizenship in any other country, be at least 18 years of age, and not be a public official or officeholder.|$|R

2500|$|On 22 April 2010, it was {{announced}} that a constitutional referendum, in order to reduce presidential powers and [...] "strengthen democracy," [...] would be held on 27 June 2010; <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>elections</b> would then follow on 10 October 2010.|$|R
5|$|A {{by-election}} {{need not}} be held to fill a vacancy in any GRC triggered by the death or resignation of an MP, {{even if there are}} no other minority candidates in that GRC, or any other reason. A by-election is required only if all the MPs in a GRC vacate their Parliamentary seats. Assuming that such a situation does arise, the Prime Minister would be obliged to call a by-election within a reasonable time, unless he intends to call <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election</b> in the near future.|$|E
5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election.</b> Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait until after the election, but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E
5|$|According to the Constitution and the PEA, {{there must}} be between three and six MPs in a GRC. The precise number of MPs in each GRC is {{declared}} by the President at the Cabinet's direction prior to <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election.</b> For {{the purposes of the}} 2015 general election, there were 13 SMCs and 16 GRCs, and each GRC had between four and six MPs.|$|E

5|$|Alexander {{controversially}} {{married the}} commoner Aspasia Manos in 1919, provoking a major scandal that forced {{the couple to}} leave Greece for several months. Soon after returning to Greece with his wife, Alexander was bitten by a domestic Barbary macaque and died of sepsis. The sudden death of the sovereign led to questions over the monarchy's survival {{and contributed to the}} fall of the Venizelist regime. After <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election</b> and a referendum, Constantine I was restored to the throne.|$|E
5|$|At {{the general}} {{election}} on 17 September 2006 the Alliance for Sweden won {{a majority of the}} votes after the first count, defeating the Social Democratic Party. The Moderates gained 26.1 percent of the votes, a new record for the party and over 10 percentage points higher than in 2002. The election result was also historic in being the worst result for the Social Democrats ever (34.6 percent) in <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election</b> under universal suffrage (introduced in 1921).|$|E
5|$|Baldwin called <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election</b> for 30 May 1929, which {{resulted}} in a hung parliament, with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his government resigned and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald (1866–1937) took office. In 1931, the MacDonald government faced a serious crisis, as the May Report revealed that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120million. On 24 August 1931 the Labour government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government supported by most Conservative MPs. Chamberlain once again returned to the Ministry of Health.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin called <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election</b> for 30 May 1929.

Chamberlain easily won in Edgbaston, which he represented {{for the rest of his}} life, but the general election resulted in a hung parliament, with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his Government resigned, and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald took office.|$|E
5|$|By 1987, {{unemployment}} was falling, {{the economy}} was stable and strong and inflation was low. Opinion polls showed a comfortable Conservative lead, and local council election results had also been successful, prompting Thatcher to call <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election</b> for 11 June that year, despite the deadline for an election still being 12 months away. The election saw Thatcher re-elected for a third successive term.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{decided to}} stand for the House of Commons, and was adopted as Unionist {{candidate}} for Birmingham Ladywood. After the war ended, <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election</b> was called almost immediately. He was elected with almost 70% of the vote {{and a majority of}} 6,833. He was 49 years old, which remains to date the oldest age at which any future Prime Minister has first been elected to the Commons.|$|E

5|$|Harper's Cabinet was {{defeated}} in a no-confidence vote on March 25, 2011, after being found in contempt of parliament. Harper thus, in accordance with constitutional convention, advised the Governor General to call <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election.</b> This was the first occurrence in Commonwealth history of a government in the Westminster parliamentary tradition losing {{the confidence of the}} lower house on the grounds of contempt of parliament. The no-confidence motion was carried with a vote of 156 in favour of the motion and 145 against.|$|E
5|$|In March 1979 James Callaghan's Labour {{government}} fell, and <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election</b> {{was called}} for 3 May. This led to a brief delay in {{the start of the}} trial as Thorpe, who still had a following among North Devon Liberals, was adopted as their candidate in the election. Largely isolated from his party's national campaign, he lost the seat to his Conservative opponent by over 8,000 votes.|$|E
