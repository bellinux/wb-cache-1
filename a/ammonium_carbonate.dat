40|$|The novel {{technology}} of calcination to prepare triuranium octaoxide (U 3 O 8) from <b>ammonium</b> uranyl <b>carbonate</b> in microwave fields was investigated {{on the basis}} of the temperature rising characteristics of <b>ammonium</b> uranyl <b>carbonate,</b> triuranium octaoxide (U 3 O 8), and their mixture. The result of experiments show that <b>ammonium</b> uranyl <b>carbonate</b> had weak capability to absorb microwave energy, while triuranium octaoxide has the very strong capability to absorb microwave energy and the sample temperature increased rapidly with an increase mixture ratio of triuranium octaoxide. The optimal calcination conditions were as follows: microwave power 700 W, calcination time 10 min and 60 g in this experiments range, respectively. Under these conditions the value of total uranium and U 4 + of triuranium octaoxide was 84. 28 % and 31. 02 %, respectively. It is feasible to prepare triuranium octaoxide by calcination from <b>ammonium</b> uranyl <b>carbonate,</b> which mixed with small amounts of triuranium octaoxide under microwave fields.

2500|$|Some {{difficulty}} {{has arisen}} since {{the passing of}} the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act concerning the use of the Pharmacopoeia as a legal standard for the drugs and preparations contained in it. The Pharmacopoeia is defined in the preface as only [...] "intended to afford {{to the members of the}} medical profession and those engaged in the preparation of medicines throughout the British Empire one uniform standard and guide whereby the nature and composition of, substances to be used in medicine may be ascertained and determined". It is obvious that it cannot be an encyclopaedia of substances used in medicine, and can only be used as a standard for the substances and preparations contained in it, and for no others. It has been held in the Divisional Courts (Dickins v. Randerson) that the Pharmacopoeia is a standard for official preparations asked for under their pharmacopoeial name. But there are many substances in the Pharmacopoeia which are not only employed in medicine, but have other uses, such as sulphur, gum benzoin, tragacanth, gum arabic, <b>ammonium</b> <b>carbonate,</b> beeswax, oil of turpentine, linseed oil, and for these a commercial standard of purity as distinct from a medicinal one is needed, since the preparations used in medicine should be of the highest possible degree of purity obtainable, and this standard would be too high and too expensive for ordinary purposes. The use of trade synonyms in the Pharmacopoeia, such as saltpetre for purified potassium nitrate, and milk of sulphur for precipitated sulphur, is partly answerable for this difficulty, and has proved to be a mistake, since it affords ground for legal prosecution if a chemist sells a drug of ordinary commercial purity for trade purposes, instead of the purified preparation which is official in the Pharmacopoeia for medicinal use. This would not be the case if the trade synonym were omitted. For many drugs and chemicals not in the Pharmacopoeia there is no standard of purity that can be used under the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act, and for these, as well as for the commercial quality of those drugs and essential oils which are also in the Pharmacopoeia, a legal standard of commercial purity is much needed. This subject formed the basis of discussion at several meetings of the Pharmaceutical Society, and the results have been embodied in a work called Suggested Standards for Foods and Drugs by C.G. Moor, which indicates the average degree of purity of many drugs and chemicals used in the arts, as well as the highest degree of purity obtainable in commerce of those used in medicine.|$|E
