5|$|Shortly {{before the}} Voyager 1 encounter, Stan Peale, Patrick Cassen, and R. T. Reynolds {{published}} {{a paper in}} the journal Science predicting a volcanically modified surface and a differentiated interior, with distinct rock types rather than a homogeneous blend. They based this prediction on models of Io's interior that took into account the massive <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> produced by the varying tidal pull of Jupiter on Io caused by its slightly eccentric orbit. Their calculations suggested that the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generated for an Io with a homogeneous interior would be three {{times greater than the}} <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generated by radioactive isotope decay alone. This effect would be even greater with a differentiated Io.|$|E
5|$|A general {{drawback}} of conduction {{through a}} wall technologies is that the retorts are more costly when scaled-up due to the resulting large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> conducting walls made of high-temperature alloys.|$|E
5|$|Some reviewers {{praised the}} new laptop's {{performance}} and compact size, {{the quality of}} the screen, and sturdy unibody build, which allowed easier upgrading of internal components as compared to the original models. Some reviewers also noted that the new MacBook Pro ran more quietly and at cooler temperatures than first generation machines. Others, however, criticized the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generated by the new design.|$|E
50|$|Unlike some {{techniques}} discussed here, the use {{of thermal}} compound or padding is almost universal when dissipating significant <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Therefore, {{water may}} be a better coolant if an engine is {{permanently}} producing large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat,</b> making it better for high-performance or racing engines.|$|R

5|$|Although Jupiter {{would need}} to be about 75 times as massive to fuse {{hydrogen}} and become a star, the smallest red dwarf is only about 30 percent larger in radius than Jupiter. Despite this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun; the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation it receives. This additional heat is generated by the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism through contraction. This process causes Jupiter to shrink by about 2cm each year. When it was first formed, Jupiter was much hotter and was about twice its current diameter.|$|E
5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only a limited <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E
5|$|Another {{problem with}} the NIF lasers is that the flashtubes create a {{significant}} <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat,</b> which warms the laser glass enough to cause it to deform. This requires a lengthy cooling-off period between shots, {{on the order of}} 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than one shot per day. To be useful as a power plant, about a dozen shots would have to take place every second, well beyond the capabilities of the NIF lasers.|$|E
30|$|Electric {{bottom-hole}} heaters {{are designed}} to deliver controlled <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> energy using externally controlled power cables. Figure  3 shows a schematic representation of a bottom-hole heater.|$|R
2500|$|Heat is {{typically}} transferred through engineered heating or cooling systems {{by using a}} flowing gas or liquid. [...] Air is sometimes used, but quickly becomes impractical under many circumstances because it requires large ducts to transfer relatively small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat.</b> In systems using refrigerant, this working fluid {{can also be used}} to transfer heat a considerable distance, though this can become impractical because of increased risk of expensive refrigerant leakage. [...] When large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> are to be transferred, water {{is typically}} used, often supplemented with antifreeze, corrosion inhibitors, and other additives.|$|R
50|$|The devices {{generate}} {{alternating current}} signals through a sliver electrode, stimulating the tongue's taste receptors {{to emulate the}} major taste components. It also produces small, varying <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> to simulate food.|$|R
5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs {{along the edge of}} their wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the capillary network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|Larger bodied {{specimens}} of Dimetrodon have larger sails {{relative to their}} size, an example of positive allometry. Positive allometry may benefit thermoregulation because it means that, as individuals get larger, surface area increases faster than mass. Larger-bodied animals generate {{a great deal of}} heat through metabolism, and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> that must be dissipated from the body surface is significantly greater than what must be dissipated by smaller-bodied animals. Effective heat dissipation can be predicted across many different animals with a single relationship between mass and surface area. However, a 2010 study of allometry in Dimetrodon found a different relationship between its sail and body mass: the actual scaling exponent of the sail was much larger than the exponent expected in an animal adapted to heat dissipation. The researchers concluded that the sail of Dimetrodon grew at a much faster rate than was necessary for thermoregulation, and suggested that sexual selection was the primary reason for its evolution.|$|E
5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E
50|$|EPA {{approved}} a new permit that will force {{the plant to}} virtually stop releasing massive <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>heated</b> water into the Taunton River daily, a situation that environmentalists say decimated the fish population.|$|R
30|$|Production {{facility}} {{heating systems}} (building and use water) can {{also benefit from}} heat recovery from the pneumatic system. However, in Western Australia this <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> energy is too low for reasonable implementation [22].|$|R
50|$|Zaikron: Appears in episode 37. Powers include swimming, a 10-tube missile {{launcher}} in the torso, flight, coiling treads in each shoulder that emit massive <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat,</b> reformation, and saw-like wheels on the hips.|$|R
5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} before the Voyager 1 encounter, Stan Peale, Patrick Cassen, and R. T. Reynolds {{published}} a paper in the journal Science predicting a volcanically modified surface and a differentiated interior, with distinct rock types rather than a homogeneous blend. They based this prediction on models of Io's interior that took into account the massive <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> produced by the varying tidal pull of Jupiter on Io resulting from Io's Laplace resonance with Europa and Ganymede not allowing its orbit to circularize. Their calculations suggested that the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generated for an Io with a homogeneous interior would be three times greater than the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generated by radioactive isotope decay alone. This effect would be even greater with a differentiated Io.|$|E
25|$|On a {{laboratory}} scale, sulfuric acid can be diluted by pouring concentrated acid onto crushed ice made from de-ionized water. The ice melts in an endothermic process while dissolving the acid. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> needed to melt {{the ice in}} this process {{is greater than the}} <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> evolved by dissolving the acid so the solution remains cold. After all the ice has melted, further dilution can take place using water.|$|E
5000|$|Planck (1914, page 40) {{refers to}} a {{condition}} of thermodynamic equilibrium, in which [...] "any two bodies or elements of bodies selected at random exchange by radiation equal <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> with each other." ...|$|R
5000|$|High-level waste - highly {{radioactive}} materials that emit significant <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat.</b> Cooling and shielding is necessary {{so as to}} protect the environment from their potential adverse effects. Safe disposal is possible only in deep geological repositories.|$|R
50|$|Melanin {{is not a}} photocarcinogen, {{because it}} dissipates the {{excitation}} energy into small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> (see photoprotection). Oxybenzone (a component of some sunscreens) is suspected owing to its skin penetrating qualities and its production of free radicals.|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{chemical}} {{experiments on}} this compound must be performed with caution {{to prevent the}} great <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> released in an exothermic reaction from causing the solution to boil-over or damage the vessel.|$|E
25|$|Design of an {{industrial}} heating system starts with {{assessment of the}} temperature required, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> required, and the feasible modes of transferring heat energy. In addition to conduction, convection and radiation, electrical heating methods can use electric and magnetic fields to heat material.|$|E
25|$|The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> {{applied to}} the metal is a {{function}} of the welding tip size, the speed of travel, and the welding position. The flame size is determined by the welding tip size. The proper tip size is determined by the metal thickness and the joint design.|$|E
50|$|ColdHeat was an American company founded {{to develop}} and market {{products}} using the proprietary graphite-like compound Athalite.

25|$|To aid combustion, {{liquefied}} sulfur (140–150°C) is sprayed {{through an}} atomizing nozzle to generate fine drops of sulfur {{with a large}} surface area.

5000|$|Different notations {{are used}} for infinitesimal <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> (...) and infinitesimal <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> entropy (...) because entropy is a {{function}} <b>of</b> state, while <b>heat,</b> like work, is not.
