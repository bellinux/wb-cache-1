40|$|On 27 April 1998, the European Union (EU) {{removed the}} People's Republic of China from {{its list of}} {{non-market}} economies (NMEs) due to the progress made under China's economic reforms. After that, it has applied a hybrid anti-dumping policy towards imports from China, {{including the use of}} the <b>analogue</b> <b>country</b> method, conditional market economy treatment, one country one duty rule and individual treatment. However, there has been no significant change as far as the EU anti-dumping authority's practice is concerned. This is inconsistent with China's current economic status as a transitional economy with many sectors very close to a market economy. This thesis analyses the implementation of the policy and explores its legal problems and issues from both a theoretical and practical standpoint. The study begins by examining the origin of EU anti-dumping legislation - the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) anti-dumping rules. It identifies the legal problems of EU anti-dumping practice in the context of China's economic reforms starting from 1979. In order to suggest solutions to several of the problems thus identified, comparative studies are made to reveal alternative strategies by illustrating the anti-dumping legislation of the U. S, Australia, New Zealand and Japan insofar as it is applicable to China. Due to China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 11 December 2001, new issues and disputes may arise with regard to the EU's anti-dumping practice. With regard to all of these issues, this thesis finally attempts to propose solutions to both the EU and China. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

50|$|RTI(-4229)-150, ((−)-2β-Carbocyclobutoxy-3β-(4-methylphenyl)tropane) is a phenyltropane {{derivative}} {{which acts}} as a potent dopamine reuptake inhibitor and stimulant drug. It is around 5x more potent than cocaine, but is more selective for the dopamine transporter relative to the other monoamine transporters. RTI-150 has a fast onset of effects and short duration of action, and its abuse potential in animal studies {{is similar to that}} of cocaine itself; its main application in scientific research has been in studies investigating the influence of pharmacokinetics on the abuse potential of stimulant drugs, with the rapid entry of RTI-150 into the brain thought to be a key factor in producing its high propensity for development of dependence in animals. RTI-150 is not explicitly illegal anywhere in the world, but its similar structure and pharmacological activity to cocaine makes it possible that it would be considered a controlled substance <b>analogue</b> in <b>countries</b> such as the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand which have controlled substance analogue legislation.|$|R

Analogues of α-PPP such as pyrovalerone and MDPV have been more widely used and are presumed to be more potent and addictive than α-PPP itself. Structure-activity relationships of these drugs suggest {{that a variety of}} ring-substituted analogues are likely to be potential drugs of abuse, and stimulant activity has been found for analogues with between 3 and 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain.|$|R

5000|$|This is nihilism, or this is truth. He has to push in past boundaries. There is {{the outline}} of a body, distinct, separate, its {{integrity}} an illusion, a tragic deception, because unseen there is a slit between the legs, and he has to push into it. There is never a real privacy of the body that can coexist with intercourse: with being entered. The vagina itself is muscled and the muscles have to be pushed apart. The thrusting is persistent invasion. She is opened up, split down the center. She is occupied--physically, internally, in her privacy. ...There is no analogue anywhere among subordinated groups of people to this experience of being made for intercourse: for penetration, entry, occupation. There is no <b>analogue</b> in occupied <b>countries</b> or in dominated races or in imprisoned dissidents or in colonialized cultures or in the submission of children to adults or in the atrocities that have marked the twentieth century ranging from Auschwitz to the Gulag. There is nothing exactly the same, and this is not because the political invasion and significance of intercourse is banal up against these other hierarchies and brutalities. Intercourse is a particular reality for women as an inferior class; and it has, in it, as part of it, violation of boundaries, taking over, occupation, destruction of privacy, all of which are construed to be normal and also fundamental to continuing human existence. There is nothing that happens to any other civilly inferior people that is the same in its meaning and in its effect even when those people are forced into sexual availability, heterosexual or homosexual; while the subject people, for instance, may be forced to have intercourse with those who dominate them, the God who does not exist did not make human existence, broadly speaking, dependent on their compliance. The political meaning of intercourse for women is the fundamental question of feminism and freedom: can an occupied people--physically occupied inside, internally invaded--be free; can those with a metaphysically compromised privacy have self-determination; can those without a biologically based physical integrity have self-respect?
