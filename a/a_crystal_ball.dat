5|$|George {{returns to}} Paris and learns from Andre Lobineau, a {{colleague}} of Nicole's, that Montfauçon is a location in Paris. Flap and Guido attempt to steal the tripod from the museum; but they are beaten to the theft by Nicole, who gives the artifact to George. In the sewers of Montfauçon, George spies on a secret meeting of people who {{claim to be the}} Templars, and he learns of their plan to find the Sword of Baphomet. After the group leaves, George uses the tripod and gem in the underground chamber to reveal the name of a village in Syria: Marib. He travels to the village and discovers that Khan has been looking for him. At a nearby rock formation called the Bull's Head, George finds a lens and deduces that it is represented on the manuscript as <b>a</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>ball.</b> He also discovers an idol with three bearded faces, Baphomet; and a Latin inscription that describes Britain. Khan arrives and holds George at gunpoint, but George manages to escape.|$|E

25|$|One {{class of}} methods of scrying {{involves}} a self-induced trance, {{with or without}} the aid of a medium such as <b>a</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>ball.</b> Some say that the sensation is drug-like, some that various drugs can potentiate the experience; others categorically exclude any connection with drug usage, claiming that it invalidates any images observed.|$|E

25|$|The Wicked Witch of the West also changes {{significantly}} between {{books and}} movie. In the books no mention is ever made {{of her skin}} color, whereas in the movie she is green without explanation, although the Winkies she has enslaved and turned into soldiers are also green. In the book it is implied but not stated that she dresses in yellow, as yellow is the official dominant color of the Winkie Country where she rules, whereas in the movie she dresses entirely in black. In the book she is portrayed as having only one eye, which is so powerful it could see distant objects like a telescope, but in the movie she uses <b>a</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>ball</b> to watch Dorothy and her friends from afar. The 1939 MGM film makes the first reference to The Witches of the East and West being sisters, which {{was not the case}} in the book; none of the Witches in Baum's Oz are related.|$|E

500|$|Because Tibetan {{philosophy}} of mind is ultimately soteriological, {{it focuses on}} meditative practices such as Dzogchen and Mahamudra that allow a practitioner to experience the true reflexive nature of their mind directly.

500|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{has decided}} to boycott the Steamtown Mall after a shop owner refuses to serve him, {{going so far as}} to cancel orders to {{businesses}} there. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and the rest of the office convince Dwight to get revenge on the shop owner by making Dwight appear to be high-class, and then having him refuse to buy from the shop, a scheme the office references from the movie Pretty Woman. Using tips from the rest of the office to make himself appear more sophisticated, Dwight, with Jim and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), return to the shop. To their surprise, the shop owner immediately recognizes Dwight even in his new attire, and explains that they did not serve him before because they were intimidated by his blood-soaked hands (actually beet juice). Dwight, somewhat flustered from the truth of the situation being revealed to him, stumbles over his words before finally saying the line he had come all the way there to say, [...] "You made a big mistake. Huge!", while waving his shopping bags. The group leaves somewhat embarrassed, but not before Dwight buys what he came for: a pewter wizard statuette holding <b>a</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|E
