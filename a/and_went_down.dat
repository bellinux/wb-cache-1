5|$|From 1915, Summer Hill {{was served}} by trams from Hurlstone Park. Trams left New Canterbury Road <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> Prospect Road, then swung right onto Smith Street. They turned onto Lackey Street, {{where they went}} right and {{terminated}} at the station. Low usage and rival buses saw the line closed in 1933, however some remains can be seen.|$|E
5|$|Both battleships were {{relegated to}} reserve and {{auxiliary}} {{roles in the}} mid-1930s. Kilkis, which had been upgraded in the mid-1920s, became a naval artillery training facility in 1932. Limnos guns were removed and installed in a coastal defense battery {{on the island of}} Aegina. While they were both anchored in the Salamis Naval Base on 23 April 1941, both ships were sunk during the German invasion of Greece by Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers. Kilkis was hit by bombs <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> in shallow water at her moorings; Limnos was also hit, but was able to get underway enough to be beached. The wrecks were refloated and sold for scrap in the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Hector Macdonald Laws (Hec) Waller, DSO and Bar (4 April 1900– 1 March 1942) was {{a senior}} officer in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). His career spanned almost thirty years, {{including}} service in both world wars. At the helm of HMAS Stuart in the Mediterranean from 1939 to 1941, he won recognition as a skilful ship's captain and flotilla commander. He then transferred to the South West Pacific as captain of the light cruiser HMAS Perth, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> with his ship against heavy odds during the Battle of Sunda Strait in early 1942.|$|E
5|$|After {{the militia}} {{advanced}} about 200yards (200m), the Kickapoo suddenly let loose a loud yell from their hidden {{position on the}} bank of an oxbow lake along the river. The warriors fired a volley toward the advancing militia and three men, Samuel Black, Samuel Wells and Montaville Morris, were hit <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>down.</b> Dodge did not hesitate and ordered his men to charge, they obeyed and waited until they were within six feet of the Kickapoo before discharging their weapons. The fight, after the initial charge and volley, descended into a hand-to-hand struggle with tomahawks, bayonets, muskets and spears the weapons of choice. The fighting only lasted a few minutes: nine Kickapoo were killed on the spot and the other two were felled while fleeing across the lake. During the hand-to-hand combat a fourth member of the militia, Thomas Jenkins, was wounded. Though short, the Battle of Horseshoe Bend had a lasting impact and influence {{on the rest of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Traveling {{down the}} rows of Austrian battleships, the two men {{encountered}} Viribus Unitis at around 4:40am. Rossetti placed one canister of TNT on the hull of the battleship, timed to explode at 6:30am. He then flooded the second canister, sinking it on the harbor floor close to the ship. This second canister exploded close to the Austrian freighter Wien, resulting in her sinking. The men had no breathing sets, and therefore had to keep their heads above water. They were discovered and taken prisoner just after placing the explosives under the battleship's hull. The two-man team were captured and taken aboard Viribus Unitis, where they informed the new captain of the battleship {{what they had done}} but did not reveal the exact position of the explosives. Admiral Vuković then arranged for the two prisoners to be taken safely to the sister ship , and ordered the evacuation of the ship. The explosion did not happen at 6:30 as predicted and Vuković returned to the ship with many sailors (believing mistakenly that the Italians had lied). He therefore remained on his ship <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> with her and 300–400 of her crew when the mines exploded shortly afterwards at 6:44. Following the explosion, the battleship sank in 15 minutes.|$|E

25|$|The {{force of}} the {{explosion}} almost instantly tore the ship in two parts. The bow quickly sank vertically, while the severely damaged 30-meter high stern drifted for another hundred meters before sinking. Eighteen other ships arrived at the site, {{but most of the}} crew were trapped inside the hull <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> with the ship.|$|E

This noticeably increased the populace's support for Catherine and is reenacted annually in the historic carnival of Verrès.|$|E

25|$|By {{now there}} was an {{increasing}} number of men in the water, and trooper James Werner Magnusson of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles saw an injured soldier struggling in the very rough sea.

The ousted passenger, luckily a strong swimmer, had made it to shore, but his companions must not have fancied the idea of following him into the frigid and swift water, as they all paid their fares immediately.|$|E

Though he recovered from injuries in late December, Malinga was unavailable to South Africa series after a bout of dengue. Malinga was picked up to the Australian tour and played in the match against Prime Minister's XI.

25|$|At 10:24a.m., the Vietnamese {{warships}} HQ-16 and HQ-10 {{opened fire}} on the Chinese warships. The HQ-4 and HQ-5 then joined in. The sea battle lasted about 40 minutes, with vessels on both sides taking damage. The smaller Chinese warships managed to maneuver into the blind spots of the main cannons on the Vietnamese warships and damaged all four Vietnamese ships, especially the Nhật Tảo (HQ-10), which could not retreat because her last working engine was disabled. The crew was ordered to abandon ship, but her captain, Lt. Commander Ngụy Văn Thà, remained on board <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> with his ship. The HQ-16, severely damaged by friendly fire from the HQ-5, was forced to retreat westwards. The HQ-4 and HQ-5 soon joined in the retreat.|$|E
25|$|The 2002 Oregon gubernatorial {{election}} {{took place}} on November 5, 2002. Incumbent Democratic Governor of Oregon John Kitzhaber was unable to seek a third consecutive term as governor, therefore creating an open seat. To replace him, former Oregon Supreme Court Associate Justice Ted Kulongoski won a crowded and competitive Democratic primary, while former State Representative Kevin Mannix emerged from an equally competitive Republican primary. The campaign between Kulongoski and Mannix, who were joined by Libertarian nominee Tom Cox, was close <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to the wire. Ultimately, Kulongoski eked out a narrow margin of victory over Mannix, which was slightly smaller than Cox's total vote share, allowing Kulongoski to win {{what would be the}} first of two terms as governor.|$|E
