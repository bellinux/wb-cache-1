25|$|According to the French Government, {{which does}} {{not have the right to}} ask direct {{questions}} about religion and uses a criterion of people's geographic origin as a basis for calculation, there were between 5 and 6 million Muslims in metropolitan France in 2010. The government counted <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> in France who migrated from countries with a dominant Muslim population, or whose parents did. Only 33% of those 5 to 6 million people (2 million) said they were practicing believers. That figure is the same as that obtained by the INED/INSEE study in October 2010.|$|E
25|$|A complex {{operation}} {{was needed to}} house and feed <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> moving and staying in Portugal for a considerable period of time. According to Saraiva and some other historians, {{it should also be}} Leite Pinto, former Portuguese minister of education, that should also take the credit for most refugees saved during the war. Professor Baltasar Rebelo de Sousa mentioned the “Leite Pinto operation", that used sealed trains to bring thousands of refugees into Portugal, and praised this operation in a tribute to Leite Pinto. Forced by the circumstances, several Portuguese assistance associations, sponsored by the government, were then created in Portugal for the integration and hosting of this large number of refugees, mostly Jews, also hosted and received by Portuguese families.|$|E

25|$|McGuirk {{had many}} people who worked for him as matchmaker: Leo Voss, Sam Menacker, Rip Tyler, Wayne Martin, and George Scott. Of <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>people,</b> Cowboy Bill Watts played {{a big part in}} McGuirk’s promotion, both {{positively}} and negatively. His first real connection to McGuirk was in 1968, when McGuirk submitted the only vote in favor of passing the NWA Championship to him. McGuirk and Watts worked together to promote Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana in the late 1970s. On July 22, 1978, their joint promotion of a wrestling show at the Louisiana Superdome drew an estimated 31,000 fans and a gate of $140,000. A dispute between the two in August 1979 strained their friendship. While Watts incorporated Mid-South Sports Inc. and had agreements Jim Barnett, Eddie Graham, Fritz Von Erich, and Vincent J. McMahon that made the promotion thrive. McGuirk became desperate and hoped that George Scott would help keep the territory afloat.|$|E
25|$|The year 1795 {{marked the}} {{downfall}} of the Dutch Republic and gave birth to the Batavian Republic. At the beginning of the 19th century, the first codification of Dutch national citizenship appeared in the Napoleonic Code for the Kingdom of Holland effective from 1801–1811, originating from the French code of civil rights, the Code Civil. In 1813, after the proclamation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Code Civil continued to remain in effect even though a new Dutch constitution was drawn in 1815. The new constitution de facto became the first Dutch codification of Dutch citizenship, where it was stated that, starting from 1815, only residents had the freedom to occupy positions in public offices. This was a significant change from the citizenship laws of the preceding centuries. The Dutch civil code stipulated that residents were only those people who were born to parents officially residing on Dutch territory. Due to the colonial ambitions of the Netherlands, <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> who traveled abroad in official service of the country were considered to live in the Netherlands and were to be counted as residents. The new Dutch civil law was the building block for the implementation of jus sanguinis. On the other hand, even though descent remained very important for the acquisition of citizenship, the emphasis on the significance of residency, was evidence of the French influence of jus soli.|$|E

500|$|Akiva Goldsman {{decided to}} move the story from Los Angeles to New York City to take {{advantage}} of locations that would more easily show emptiness. Goldsman explained, [...] "L.A. looks empty at three o'clock in the afternoon, [...] New York is never empty [...] [...] [...] it was a much more interesting way of showing the windswept emptiness of the world." [...] Warner Bros. initially rejected this idea because of the logistics, but Francis Lawrence was determined to shoot on location, to give the film a natural feel that would benefit from not shooting on soundstages. Lawrence went to the city with a camcorder, and filmed areas filled with crowds. Then, a special effects test was conducted to remove <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>people.</b> The test had a powerful effect on studio executives. Michael Tadross convinced authorities to close busy areas such as the Grand Central Terminal viaduct, several blocks of Fifth Avenue, and Washington Square Park.

[...] In her closing message in Müller's biography of Anne Frank, Miep Gies expressed a similar thought, though she attempted to dispel what she felt was a growing misconception that [...] "Anne symbolises the six million victims of the Holocaust", writing: [...] "Anne's life and death were her own individual fate, an individual fate that happened six million times over.

Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. <b>All</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while."
