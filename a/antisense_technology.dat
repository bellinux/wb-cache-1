5|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{a biological}} {{process in which}} RNA molecules inhibit gene expression or translation, by neutralizing targeted mRNA molecules. Historically, it was known by other names, including co-suppression, post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), and quelling. Only after these apparently unrelated processes were fully understood did it become clear that they all described the RNAi phenomenon. Andrew Fire and Craig C. Mello shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on RNA interference in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which they published in 1998. Since the discovery of RNAi and its regulatory potentials, it has become evident that RNAi has immense potential in suppression of desired genes.

It has long appeared to be an ideal strategy to leverage new genomic knowledge for drug discovery and development. During the past 20 years the technology associated with the development of antisense has improved dramatically and emerging chemistries have made antisense oligonucleotides into powerful and versatile tools to study the function of proteins in living cells. In recent years, <b>antisense</b> <b>technologies</b> have been widely used as potent and promising tools for this purpose.

In actual fact, there is a conventional identity between GMOs and transgenic organisms, so that genetic modification methods such as somatic hybridization and mutagenesis are equalized to conventional breeding. A loophole in this system is represented by more or less innovative genetic engineering approaches under regulatory discussion, such as cisgenesis, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, and <b>antisense</b> <b>technologies,</b> that are redefining the concept of GMOs and might circumvent the requirements of the GMO legislation and, indirectly, of organic farming...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the effects of {{structure}} on nucleic acid heteroduplex formation by analyzing hybridization of tRNAphe to {{a complete set of}} complementary oligonucleotides, ranging from single nucleotides to dodecanucleotides. The analysis points to features in tRNA that determine heteroduplex yield. All heteroduplexes that give high yield include both double-stranded stems as well as single-stranded regions. Bases in the single-stranded regions are stacked onto the stems, and heteroduplexes terminate at potential interfaces for coaxial stacking. Heteroduplex formation is disfavored by sharp turns or a lack of helical order in single-stranded regions, competition from bases displaced from a stem, and stable tertiary interactions. The study is relevant to duplex formation on oligonucleotide microarrays and to <b>antisense</b> <b>technologies...</b>|$|R

40|$|The tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus) has an {{important}} place in the aquaculture of the developing world. It {{is also a very}} useful laboratory animal, and readily lends itself to the transgenic technology. Through the use of reporter genes, a range of potential gene promoters have been tested in tilapia, both through transient and stable expression of the reporter construct. Using the transgenic technology, growth enhanced lines of tilapia have been produced. These fish have no abnormalities and offer a considerable growth advantage for future exploitation. It is however crucial that transgenic fish, to be exploited in aquaculture, be sterile, and various methods of achieving sterility are considered. These include triploidy, gene knock out of crucial hormone encoding genes via homologous recombination, and knock down of the function of the same genes via ribozyme or <b>antisense</b> <b>technologies.</b> Transgenic tilapia also offer the potential for exploitation as biofactories in the production of valuable pharmaceutical products, and this is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are {{a family}} of {{endogenous}} small noncoding RNA molecules, of 19 – 28 nucleotides in length. In humans, up to 3 % of all genes are estimated to encode these evolutionarily conserved sequences. miRNAs are thought to control expression of thousands of target mRNAs. Mammalian miRNAs generally negatively regulate gene expression by repressing translation, possibly through effects on mRNA stability and compartmentalisation, and/or the translation process itself. An extensive range of in silico and experimental techniques have been applied {{to our understanding of}} the occurrence and functional relevance of such sequences, and <b>antisense</b> <b>technologies</b> have been successfully used to control miRNA expression in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, miRNAs have been identified in both normal and pathological conditions, including differentiation and development, metabolism, proliferation, cell death, viral infection and cancer. Of specific relevance and excitement to the area of diabetes research, miRNA regulation has been implicated in insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, diabetic heart conditions and nephropathy.

This gene specifies resistance to amikacin and other aminoglycosides, seriously limiting {{the effectiveness of}} these antibiotics. An antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN 4) that binds to a duplicated sequence on the aac(6 =) -IbmRNA, one of the copies overlapping the initiation codon, efficiently inhibited translation in vitro. An isosequential nuclease-resistant hybrid oligomer composed of 2 =, 4 =-bridged nucleic acid-NC (BNANC) residues and deoxynucleotides (BNANC-DNA) conjugated to the permeabilizing peptide (RXR) 4 XB (“X ” and “B ” stand for 6 -aminohexanoic acid and -alanine, respectively) (CPPBD 4) inhibited translation in vitro at the same levels observed in testing ODN 4. Furthermore, CPPBD 4 in combination with amikacin inhibited growth of a clinical A. baumannii strain harboring aac(6 =) -Ib in liquid cultures, and when both compounds were used as combination therapy to treat infected Galleria mellonella organisms, survival was comparable to that seen with uninfected controls. Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic human pathogen,mainly nosocomial, that causes bacteremia, meningitis, uri-nary tract infections, pneumonia, and necrotizing fasciitis among other infections (1 – 4).

The association of the Xi with macro-histone H2A is also disturbed by PNA interference mapping.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to their}} short lifecycles and {{relatively}} large clutch sizes, zebrafish are a useful model for genetic studies. A common reverse genetics technique {{is to reduce}} gene expression or modify splicing using Morpholino <b>antisense</b> <b>technology.</b> Morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) are stable, synthetic macromolecules that contain the same bases as DNA or RNA; by binding to complementary RNA sequences, they can reduce the expression of specific genes or block other processes from occurring on RNA. MO can be injected into one cell of an embryo after the 32-cell stage, reducing gene expression in only cells descended from that cell. However, cells in the early embryo (less than 32 cells) are interpermeable to large molecules, allowing diffusion between cells.|$|E
50|$|There are {{currently}} no established treatments, but, one study, focused on myotonic dystrophy type 1, {{suggests that the}} use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) known as gapmers can aid in decreasing the mutant RNA repeat transcripts.

Specifically, the use of CAG gapmers showed significant decrease of toxic RNA in cell cultures and a slightly less significant decrease in a test of mouse skeletal muscle. The study also noted that ASO treatment can result in possible muscular damage, but had reason to suggest that further research of <b>antisense</b> <b>technology</b> would result in reduced effect.|$|E

An antisense RNA vector containing the full-length HuIFN-gamma cDNA in the opposite orientation was electroporated into cells constitutively producing very high levels of the cytokine. Approximately 53 % of the resulting clones exhibited a specific HuIFN-gamma inhibition of an average of 95. 5 %. The results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analyses revealed that the antisense effect originated from a specific reduction of the targeted mRNA caused by antisense RNA expression. This very effective antisense RNA strategy can have possible therapeutic applications in treating diseases where HuIFN-gamma is known to play a negative role, such as in certain autoimmune diseases. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Antisense oligonucleotides (AON) offer a {{rational}} approach for drug design. The specificity of AONs towards a complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) target via Watson and Crick base pairing {{as well as}} their ease of synthesis render this technology very attractive. RNase H-degradation of mRNA via formation of a AON/mRNA hybrid is crucial to mainstream <b>antisense</b> <b>technologies.</b> Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of the AON's structure and conformational flexibility for efficient induction of RNase H activity. However the precise mode of action and substrate specificity of the RNase H are not fully understood at present. Our Laboratory recently discovered that incorporation of flexible acyclic linkers (e. g. butanediol, 2 '-seco-RNA) significantly amplifies enzyme activity. Unfortunatly incorporation of such linkers was accompanied by a drop in the thermal stability of the AON/RNA hybrids. This prompted us to incorporate a less flexible linker such as a peptide nucleic acid, with the hope to maintain similar enzymatic activity while increasing the duplex thermal stability. This thesis highlights the synthesis of the 5 '-amino nucleoside analogue required for the incorporation of the peptide nucleic acid in both 2 '-fluoroarabinonucleic acid (2 'F-ANA) and DNA. Circular dichroism experiments afforded information on the hybrid conformation in solution, whereas UV thermal melting studies provided a measure of the thermal stability of such hybrid duplexes. Finally, ability of various linker modified AON/RNA hybrids to activate the RNase H enzyme was evaluated in parallel with the corresponding native unmodified DNA/RNA hybrids. Incorporation of a PNA residue within DNA or 2 '-FANA did not afford improvement in neither thermal stability nor enzymatic cleavage (except for homopolymeric sequences vs DNA) as compared to control or butyl-sequences...|$|R

50|$|The down {{regulation}} of the invariant chain (Ii) becomes important when considering the two pathways by which antigens are presented by cells. Most recognized tumor antigens are endogenously produced, altered gene products of mutated cells. These antigens, however, are normally only presented by MHC class I molecules, to CD8+ T cells, and not expressed on the cell surface bound to MHC class II molecules, which is required for presentation to CD4+ T cells. Research {{has shown that the}} two pathways by which antigens are presented cross over in the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell, in which MHC class I, MHC class II and endogenously synthesized antigenic proteins are all present. These antigen proteins are prevented from binding to MHC class II molecules by a protein known as the invariant chain or Ii, which, in a normal cell, remains bound to the MHC class II molecule until leaving the ER. Down {{regulation of}} this Ii, using <b>antisense</b> <b>technology,</b> has yielded promising results in allowing MHC class I tumor antigens to be expressed on MHC class II molecules at the cell surface (Qui, 1999).|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{aforementioned}} mechanisms by which CD4+ cells {{play a role in}} tumor immunity are dependent on phagocytosis of tumors by APCs and subsequent presentation on MHC class II. It is rare that tumor cells will express sufficient MHC class II to directly activate a CD4+ T cell. As such, at least two approaches have been investigated to enhance the activation of CD4+ T cells. The simplest approach involves upregulation of adhesion molecules, thus extending the presentation of antigens by APC (reference?). (Chamuleau et al., 2006) A second approach involves increasing the expression of MHC class II in tumor cells. This technique has not been used in vivo, but rather involves injection of tumor cells which have been transfected to express MHC class II molecules, in addition to suppression of the invariant chain (Ii, see below) through <b>antisense</b> <b>technology.</b> (Qiu, 1999) Mice vaccinated with irradiated strains of these cells show a greater immune response to subsequent challenge by the same tumor, without the upregulation of MHC class II, then do mice vaccinated with irradiated, but otherwise unaltered tumor cells. These findings signify a promising area of future research in the development of cancer vaccines.|$|E
40|$|In theory, {{the use of}} {{antisense}} oligodeoxynucleotides pro-vides {{a method}} to inhibit the intracellular expression of arty given targeted gene specifically.

5000|$|PTPmu is {{expressed}} in the developing brain and retina. [...] A brain cell, or neuron, has a cell body that contains the nucleus and two types of extensions or processes that grow out from the cell body, the dendrites and axons. Dendrites generally receive input from other neurons, while axons send output to adjacent neurons. These processes are called neurites when grown ‘’in vitro’’ on tissue culture plates, {{because it is not}} clear whether they are dendrites or axons. ‘’In vitro’’ growth studies are useful for evaluating the mechanisms that neurons use to grow and function. A neurite outgrowth assay is a type of experiment where neurons are placed on different adhesive substrates on tissue culture plates. A neurite outgrowth assay is meant to mimic how neurons grow inside the body. During development of the nervous system, neuronal axons reach their often-distant targets by reacting to different substrates in their environment, so-called guidance cues, that are attractive, repulsive or simply permissive, meaning these substrates pull axons toward them, away from them, or act in a way that allows growth, respectively. When PTPmu is applied to a dish as an ‘’in vitro’’ substrate, it promotes neurite outgrowth. [...] PTPmu also acts as a guidance cue during development of the nervous system, by repelling neurites of the temporal neural retina, while permitting growth of neurites from the nasal neural retina. [...] Expression of PTPmu protein capable of dephosphorylating tyrosine residues is required for mediating both nasal neurite outgrowth and temporal neurite repulsion. [...] By blocking the expression of PTPmu protein with <b>antisense</b> <b>technology,</b> or by expressing catalytically inactive mutants of PTPmu (molecules of PTPmu that can not dephosphorylate their target proteins) in the developing retina, it was shown that PTPmu is required for the development of the neural retina.|$|E
