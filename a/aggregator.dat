30|$|The <b>aggregators</b> are {{independent}} organizations who investigate the potential benefit [54], aggregate the separate EVs, {{and invest in}} facilities for supporting control [55]. The revenue of <b>aggregators</b> comes from the arbitrage in bargaining with the GSO. <b>Aggregators</b> promise to follow the orders of the GSO at the appointed time. The GSO shares the benefit to <b>aggregators</b> in return, according to whether <b>aggregators</b> follow their promises well. So <b>aggregators</b> have strong motivations to coordinate EV owners to make their charging behavior forecastable or controllable so as to {{enhance the quality of}} V 2 G services. DSM contracts would be signed between the <b>aggregators</b> and EV owners. When the DSM contracts are executed, the separate EVs are aggregated to form a so-called active distribution system (ADS).|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} role of <b>aggregators</b> in search ad markets and their effects on that marketplace. <b>Aggregators</b> can have {{positive}} effects {{similar to those of}} an arbitrageur. We argue and provide empirical evidence that, unlike arbitrageurs, <b>aggregators</b> can continue to profit {{even in the absence of}} price imbalances. Furthermore, we argue that the standard generalized second price (GSP) auction mechanisms create incentives for <b>aggregators</b> to design their sites to negatively affect the user experience and that the existence of <b>aggregators</b> in the marketplace can also negatively affect nonaggregator merchants. We propose a specific quality-based GSP mechanism that reduces the negative impacts of <b>aggregators</b> on the user and marketplace while allowing some of their positive benefits for users...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the development of}} web <b>aggregators,</b> entities that collect information {{from a wide range}} of sources, with or without prior arrangements, and add value through post-aggregation services. New Web-page extraction tools, context sensitive mediators, and agent technologies have greatly reduced the barriers to constructing <b>aggregators.</b> We predict that <b>aggregators</b> will soon emerge in industries where they were not formerly present. Through studying over a hundred existing and emerging <b>aggregators,</b> we present a model for understanding the <b>aggregator's</b> strategic interaction with existing organizations. We also suggest different ways that businesses can take advantage of the new opportunities presented. Finally, we provide valuable insights to all organizations concerning the issues, impacts, and actions required as <b>aggregators</b> become increasingly present. 1...|$|R

This article develops a model of price and quality competition between firms in the online news industry. In equilibrium, firms randomise in their pricing strategies and this generates the cross- sectional mixture of advertiser and subscription funded models we observe.
