50|$|Emeralds are {{typically}} found in calcite-dolomite veins with minor pyrite, ankerite, albite, and quartz. These veins {{are the product}} of intrusive hydrothermal fluids and metasomatic fluid interaction followed by deposition in fractures that formed {{as a result of the}} tectonic activity in the belt. The metasomatic fluids appear to be derived from particular shale formations, which are likely the source of vanadium which is the cause of the vibrant colour characteristic and could be why only formations of a certain composition are perspective target horizons for emerald mineralization. Fluids flow along faults and/or fractures and are at least partially driven by pressure from thrust propagation. Through a drop in pressure, fluids are able to cool and crystallize forming the emeralds over time. From observations of several of the mines in the area, the mineralization is favoured in the fractures within an <b>alteration</b> <b>halo</b> around large regional faults in particular formations. For example, where the Itaco Fault interacts with the Muzo Formation of Las Pavas, emeralds are formed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The metamorphosed Palaeoproterozoic Orivesi {{gold deposit}} in {{southern}} Finland is {{located within the}} Tampere Schist Belt, which belongs to the Svecofennian domain. The Orivesi mine, run by Outokumpu Mining Oy, was in production from 1994 to 2003, during which time a total of approximately 1. 7 million tons of ore was extracted, with an Au content of 9. 31  g/t, implying a total output 13. 115 tons of gold in concentrate. The hydrothermal <b>alteration</b> <b>halo</b> can be divided successively into chlorite-dominant, sericite-dominant and quartz-dominant rocks from the outer zone inwards. The host rocks of the ore are quartz rocks with andalusite-rich quartz rocks. Topaz-bearing rocks also occur in the inner part of the <b>alteration</b> <b>halo.</b> In addition to Au, the elements Ag, Te, Bi, Sb, S, As, Se, Cu, Zn, Pb, Sn and Mo are enriched to varying degrees within the <b>alteration</b> <b>halo.</b> The main ore minerals include base metal sulphides, sulphosalts and tellurides. Pyrite {{is the most common}} sulphide. The sulphosalts are represented by tetrahedrite, bournonite, boulangerite and meneghinite. The most common gold, gold-silver and silver tellurides are calaverite, montbrayite, petzite, kostovite, sylvanite and hessite. Other known tellurides include tellurobismuthite, altaite, melonite, frohbergite, tsumoite, tetradymite and rucklidgeite. Gold occurs mostly in fine-grained native grains containing an average of 5 % Ag. The native gold is usually of very small grain size, generally <  20  µm. Most of the gold grains in the deposit occur as intergrowths with tellurides. The adjacent hypabyssal intrusion is an obvious source of both hydrothermal fluids and metals. A comb quartz layering has been discovered in the transition zone between the intrusion and the <b>alteration</b> <b>halo.</b> The Orivesi deposit is thought to belong to the high-sulphidation epithermal type. Soon after its formation the deposit encountered deformation and metamorphism that amounted to lower amphibolite facies conditions. The subsequent retrograde metamorphism caused the reappearance of some hydrothermal minerals typical of high-sulphidation epithermal deposits...|$|E
40|$|The rate of {{volatile}} expulsion, {{the duration}} of venting, the total volume of volatiles expelled, {{and the size of}} intrusion required to supply them are key parameters in the formation of any magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposit that can be estimated from the morphology of the hydrothermally altered rock. The radius of pervasively altered rock around the fluid source and the taper of <b>alteration</b> <b>halo</b> with distance from the pervasively altered zone constrain the duration and rate of volatile expulsion. The volume of altered rock records the total mass of volatiles expelled. An analysis of the Pittsmont Dome at the porphyry copper system at Butte, Montana provides an example. The moles of hydrogen ion consumed during alteration are calculated from the mineralogy of unaltered and altered rock. Published composition estimates are used to determine the concentration of reactable hydrogen ion in the magmatic fluid. Diffusion from the vein to a reaction front {{at the edge of the}} halo surrounding it constrains the rate of hydrogen ion loss from the vein. Semi-analytic and finite difference simulations of <b>alteration</b> <b>halo</b> formation show how the radius of the pervasively altered zone and the steepness of the taper beyond that zone depend on the rate of volatile expulsion; the faster the fluid velocity, the less steep the taper. Data from the Pittsmont Dome suggest 23 to 30 billion tons of magmatic fluid was expelled over a period of less than 20 years. Assuming 5 wt% magmatic water in the porphyry intrusion, a spherical intrusion ~ 7 km in diameter is needed to supply the volatiles for just this part of the Butte mineralization system...|$|E
40|$|<b>Alteration</b> <b>halos</b> are the {{fingerprints}} left by hydrothermal flow in rocks and indicative of ore forming processes. The Nanling Range in southern China is a world-class tungsten province. However, it is poorly understood why <b>alteration</b> <b>halos</b> normal to veins in many tungsten deposits {{in the area}} decrease with increasing depth, and {{the time it takes}} to form the halos. Finite element based numerical experiments were conducted to investigate hydrothermal flow and species diffusion processes from fractures to adjacent wallrock in the tungsten deposits. The vertical distribution of <b>alteration</b> <b>halos</b> is influenced by wallrock porosity, fracture permeability, and the duration of hydrothermal flow in fractures. When hydrothermal fluids flow upwards, wider <b>alteration</b> <b>halos</b> are formed at deeper levels, when the wallrock has a constant porosity for a depth of around one kilometre. This is inconsistent with the characteristics of <b>alteration</b> <b>halos</b> in the tungsten deposits in southern China. <b>Alteration</b> <b>halos</b> in the tungsten deposits could be formed when the wallrock porosity decreases with increasing depth. The silicification and greisenization of the tungsten deposits could form over a period from tens of years to a few thousand years. Such a period is much shorter than the uncertainties of existing isochronal ages and may represent the duration of mineralizing pulses rather than all the geological events associated with tungsten mineralization. Tungsten diffusion from fractures to adjacent wallrock cannot produce large-scale disseminated tungsten mineralization during such a short period of time...|$|R

40|$|The geo-electric method detects Induced Polarization {{anomalies}} in the subsurface. In {{sedimentary rocks}} these anomalies are often {{situated in a}} halo above a deeper-seated hydrocarbon occurrence. An epigenetic <b>alteration</b> <b>halo</b> is stimulated by small but persistent leakage from the trap, due to diffusion and/or porefill perculation processes.

Mathematical modelling permits simulation of the micro-leakage and the geochemical processes triggered in the overburden. The influence of various rock physical parameters is examined.

Na-rich intermediate Na–K mica typically occurs together with paragonite whereas K-rich intermediate Na–K mica is intergrown with muscovite. The intermediate Na–K mica is interpreted to have formed {{as a result of the}} incomplete transformation of K-rich mica to Na-rich mica through dissolution and recrystallization processes driven by compositional changes of the hydrothermal fluids interacting with the volcanic rocks.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results of}} a short-wave infrared (SWIR) reflectance spectroscopic study of clay minerals from the Athabasca Basin. Clay minerals (dickite, kaolinite, illite, and chlorite) are widespread in the Athabasca Basin and are particularly abundant in the <b>alteration</b> <b>haloes</b> associated with the unconformitytype uranium deposits. Many previous studies have emphasized a complex paragenesis of the Athabasca kaolinite-group minerals from detrital or early diagenetic origin in unaltered sandstones to occurrences in the <b>alteration</b> <b>haloes</b> associated with uranium mineralization and in the bleached zones and late fractures. SWIR reflectance spectroscopic analysis revealed that dickite is a characteristic phase in the unaltered sandstones, whereas kaolinite is a common clay mineral in the <b>alteration</b> <b>haloes</b> and also occurs in the bleached zones and late fractures. The presence of dickite has been confirmed by combined methods of XRD, EMPA, SEM, TEM and SWIR. Although the kaolinite-group minerals of the Athabasca sedimentary rocks do not exhibit any significant variation in composition, a wide range in crystallinity (Hinckley index of 0. 12 to 1. 61) has been revealed by XRD analysis. This variation in crystallinity of kaolinite is related to paragenesis. A linear relationship was established between the Hinckley index and the S WIR absorption feature at 1400 nm. Therefore, SWIR reflectance spectroscopy is a useful paragenetic indicator. All samples of illite {{examined in this study}} were collected from <b>alteration</b> <b>haloes</b> associated with uranium mineralization and belong to the 3 T polytvpe or mixtures of 3 T and 2 M. XRD analysis revealed that these samples of illite vary in crystallinity from 1. 39 to 4. 0. Unfortunately, Pima II is incapable of distinguishing 3 T and 2 M polytypes of illite. Also no correlation was found between crystallinity and the SWIR spectra of illite. Two types of chlorite (clinochlore and sudoite) are present in the Athabasca Basin, although the latter is particularly common in the <b>alteration</b> <b>haloes</b> and has been studied in some details. Sudoite is almost invariably interlayered with illite and exhibits a wide range of compositional variation. Spectral study lias revealed that the intensities of the absorption near the 2200 nm region increase with the increase of relevant chemical compositions (AI and Fe). Artificial mixture experiments using well-characterized mineral Standards have revealed that the spectral features vary systematically with the change of the mineral abundances. Results of these artificial mixtures were used to modify an existing method for the quantitative analysis of clay minerals in the Athabasca Basin...|$|R
40|$|The Nanling Range {{located in}} South China is a {{world-class}} tungsten province. Those tungsten deposits are spatially and temporally {{associated with the}} granitic magmatism during the Late Mesozoic (J(2) -K- 2). It is common that <b>alteration</b> <b>halos</b> decrease with increasing depth at the vein-type tungsten deposits. However, the mechanisms forming the alteration characteristics are still enigmatic. In this contribution, we investigate the influences of variable fluid density and viscosity on the fluid flow and species diffusion from fractures to adjacent wallrock at the Dajishan tungsten deposit using finite element based numerical experiments. Fluid density has a negative influence on the transient pressure-driven fluid flow at Dajishan. Large-density fluids slow fluid flow and heat transfer. High-viscosity fluids flow slowly. Variations of fluid viscosity at Dajishan are large and influence hydrothermal fluid flow and species diffusion from fractures to surrounding wallrock. Depth-dependent porosity and permeability of wallrock are effective mechanisms forming the <b>alteration</b> <b>halos</b> at Dajishan. Hydraulic and geometric characteristics of joint zones influence diffusion of chemical species at {{the initial stages of}} hydrothermal fluids injected into fractures. High-permeability narrow joint zones favor formation of thick <b>alteration</b> <b>halos</b> at shallower levels. Depth-dependent wallrock porosity also impedes diffusion of metals from fractures to adjacent wallrock increasing ore formation efficiency at Dajishan. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Quantitative {{determination}} of the mineralogical composition of hydrothermally altered rocks was performed {{by means of the}} Rietveld method using X-ray powder-diffraction data. Initially, experiments were carried out to minimize systematic errors arising from preferred orientation of particles as well as micro-absorption. The precision of the proposed method was tested by independent replicate sample-preparation and analyses. The closeness of the replicate phase-determinations showed that random within-laboratory errors were comparatively small. Expressed as chemical compositions, the quantitative results are in good agreement with the major oxide concentrations determined by X-ray fluorescence. The results indicate that the relative abundances of phases and refined element substitutions were accurately determined. The method developed was applied to hydrothermally altered rocks from the Waterloo volcanic-rock-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) deposit in Queensland, Australia. Hierarchical cluster analysis led to the discrimination of several mineralogically distinct alteration-induced assemblages. These mineral assemblages are characteristic of specific zones of alteration. The strong spatial zoning with respect to the mineralized body and the distinct mineralogical assemblages of the <b>alteration</b> <b>halo</b> are interpreted to result primarily from varying degrees of hydrolytic decomposition and potassium metasomatism of the wallrocks.

The Stimson formation sandstones unconformably overlie the Murray mudstone formation and represent the youngest stratigraphic unit explored by Curiosity to date. Aqueous alteration of the parent sandstone resulted {{in a loss of}} half of the original crystalline mineral phases and a three-fold increase in X-ray amorphous material. Aqueous fluids extensively leached Mg, Al, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn and other elements from the parent material, decreased the pyroxene to feldspar ratio by a factor of two, introduced Ca and mixed-cation sulfates, and both passively and actively enriched the silica content.

Although surface and {{peripheral}} {{zone of the}} sample have yellowish altered portion, glassy chilled margin remains as relatively unaltered area.

40|$|The {{mineralogy}} {{and chemistry}} of altered basalts and the stable isotopic compositions of secondary vein carbonates were studied in cores from Ocean Drilling Program Hole 843 B, located in 95 -Ma crust of the Hawaiian Arch. Millimeter- to centimeter-sized dark <b>alteration</b> <b>halos</b> around veins are 5 %- 15 % altered to celadonite and Fe-oxyhydroxides, plus minor saponite and calcite. Adjacent gray host rocks are about 15 % altered to saponite and calcite. The dark halos are enriched in H 2 O+, CO 2, FeT, K 2 O, MnO, and Fe 3 +/FeT and depleted in SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, MgO, and TiO 2 relative to gray host rocks. Brown <b>alteration</b> <b>halos</b> occur around veins where veins are more abundant, and {{are similar to}} dark halos, but contain more Fe-oxyhydroxides and exhibit greater Fe 2 O 3 T contents and higher Fe 3 +/FeT. Stable isotopic compositions of vein carbonates are consistent with their precipitation from seawater at temperatures of 5 °- 40 °C. Crosscutting relationships of veins and zoned vein and vesicle fillings reveal a sequence of secondary mineral formation and alteration conditions. Celadonite and Fe-oxyhydroxides formed and dark <b>alteration</b> <b>halos</b> developed relatively early, under oxidizing conditions at low temperatures (< 50 °C). Saponite formed later at lower seawater/rock ratios and under more reducing conditions. Calcite and pyrite formed last in veins and vesicles from more evolved, seawaterderived fluids at temperatures of 5 °- 40 °C. A second stage of celadonite, with compositions distinct from the early celadonite, also occurred relatively late (within the "calcite stage"), and {{may be related to}} refracturing of the crust and introduction of less-evolved seawater solutions into the rocks. Trends to higher K 2 O contents are attributed to alteration, but high K/Ti, Ba, and Zr contents indicate the presence of enriched or transitional MORB. CO 2 contents of Pacific ODP cores exhibit a general increase with age suggesting progressive fixation of CO 2 as calcite in the crust, but this could be complicated by local heterogeneities in fracturing and calcite formation in the crust...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of whether or not it is possible to trace the signature of alteration haloes surrounding deep-seated unconformity-type U mineralization through thick Quaternary tills is one of great importance for those conducting exploration in glaciated areas. The geochemical signals associated with alteration are often subtle and subject to numerous sources of noise, and multi-till stratigraphies can completely mask or truncate dispersal patterns. To study glacial dispersal from alteration zones surrounding unconformity-type uranium mineralization, this study focuses on a deep-seated (> 100 m) basement-hosted unconformitytype U mineralized body known as Tatiggaq, which is located in the Thelon Basin of Nunavut. The Tatiggaq area presents an ideal opportunity to investigate this problem, since the area is blanketed by a thick (12 - 34 m) multi-till stratigraphy, mineralization does not intersect the bedrock-till interface, and the mineralization is surrounded by an extensive illitic <b>alteration</b> <b>halo</b> that reaches the bedrock surface. The recovery of till samples from diamond drill core from the multi-till stratigraphy overlying the subcropping <b>alteration</b> <b>halo</b> provides a unique opportunity to model glacial dispersal and identify whether the fingerprint of buried alteration can be traced through three dimensions to the modern day surface. Sampling of till recovered during diamond drilling was combined with the sampling of surficial mudboils in the area surrounding Tatiggaq to trace the dispersal of alteration. The drill core samples were collected from four stratigraphic units that were deposited by early southwesterly and southerly ice flows, followed by a reversal in ice flow towards the northwest and westnorthwest. Knowledge of the till stratigraphy directly above the Tatiggaq alteration zone was used to construct a three dimensional model of the sediments overlying bedrock to allow the tracing of alteration through the subsurface. The geochemical fingerprint of the <b>alteration</b> <b>halo</b> at Tatiggaq was identified by applying univariate and multivariate statistical analysis, including principal component analysis, to geochemical data from altered and fresh rocks in the region. This analysis identified the enrichment of Fe 2 O 3, K 2 O, Al 2 O 3, P 2 O 5, TiO 2, B, Ni, U, Cr, and Sc, and depletion of CaO, MnO, Na 2 O, Mo, Zn, Ba, and Sr in the altered rocks using total digestion of rock powders (HF-HClO 4 -HNO 3). Partial digestion of the same rock powders using HNO 3 -HCl identified the enrichment of U and depletion of V, Zn, Y, and Yb in the altered rocks. The observed trends in the bedrock data were then applied to the till geochemistry data to identify alteration signatures that were discernible across the till stratigraphy. These enrichment and depletion trends were used to generate four alteration indices (AI) for use in uranium exploration: - 1 = (2 + 23) / [(2 +) + (2 + 23) ] () - 2 = (+ +) / [(+) +(+ +) ] () - 3 = / (+) () - 4 = / (+) () A 3 D model of the till sequence was constructed with GOCAD® and populated with interpolated values for the four alteration indices in order to trace alteration through the subsurface. Analysis of these trends revealed that alteration near the bedrock surface is pronounced, but rapidly attenuates moving up the stratigraphic sequence. Despite the rapid attenuation of the alteration signal in the subsurface, the signal is detectable at the surface down-ice from the main alteration zone with AI 1 and AI 2, and above the alteration zone with AI 3. Although AI 4 was successful at delineating alteration in the subsurface, no patterns were observed in the surficial mudboil data using AI 4. This study shows that despite a complex Quaternary stratigraphy and ice-flow history in a region, it is possible to trace glacial dispersal of subtle geochemical signatures related to subcropping alteration zones surrounding buried basement-hosted unconformity-type uranium deposits. However, the detection of such alteration signals requires a detailed knowledge of the alteration signal being sought out and an understanding of the depositional history and stratigraphy of Quaternary sediments. Continuing research into alteration systems surrounding basement hosted unconformity-type uranium deposits will help determine the applicability of the ratios developed here to other regions...|$|E

While geologic understanding of the genesis {{of these types of}} deposits is improving, there has been little work aimed at documenting their geophysical responses. We therefore investigate the geophysical signature of two major hypogene non-sulfide deposits, Vazante in Brazil and Beltana in Australia.

Small to large IP effects were found to considerably improve the fit to the observed AEM data, and the overall fitted IP parameters were spatially consistent. However, the locations of anomalous IP parameters were quite distinct from anomalies in other geophysical data. The airborne chargeability highs were adjacent to or surrounded the ground chargeability highs in the five cases analyzed from Tasmanian data. Modeling using the established Cole-Cole physical property values for sulfides predicts that an inductive airborne system is insensitive to many conventional IP targets, unless the mineral grain size is substantially less than 1 mm. In the cases in which airborne IP responses were adjacent to ground IP targets, we hypothesized that the airborne IP may be finer grained minerals in an <b>alteration</b> <b>halo</b> surrounding the sulfide sources of the large ground IP anomalies.

40|$|Kerr-Addison, a major Archean lode {{gold deposit}} of the Abitibi Belt, {{is located in}} a zone of talc-carbonate and chlorite-carbonate rocks, {{immediately}} south of the Kirkland Lake-Larder Lake Fault Zone. Relict volcanic textures and chemical data indicate that most of the wall rocks of the mine were originally mafic and ultramafic rocks. Petrographic and geochemical studies reveal greenschist facies metamorphism with superposed distinct zonation of hydrothermal alteration, characterized by massive introduction of CO(, 2) and variable enrichments of alkali-metals and calcium, which produced a great variety of mineral assemblages. These assemblages are classified into: (a) metamorphic assemblages; (b) an initial stage of alteration; and (c) advanced stage of alteration. The alteration stages are divided into alteration types, based on the presence of certain diagnostic minerals. Alteration types of the initial stage contain chlorite which is replaced by muscovite or albite in the advanced stage of alteration. The proportion of carbonate minerals and quartz increases in this process.;Oxygen isotope data indicate fairly constant temperatures (270 (DEGREES) - 300 (DEGREES) C), and isotopic composition of hydrothermal fluids ((delta) (2 ̆ 718) O = 5 (2 ̆ 7 o) /oo) across the alteration zoning.;Gold mineralization at the Kerr-Addison mine and its contiguous <b>alteration</b> <b>halo</b> are interpreted as the result of repeated cycles of fracturing, fluid penetration and local reaction with rocks. Fluid-rock interaction produced lateral variations of fluid composition which led to gold concentration, probably due to gradients in pH, in the interface between the carbonate-muscovite and carbonate-albite alteration types...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 157 - 167. The Ventersdorp Contact Reef (VCR) is an auriferous {{conglomerate}} which unconformably overlies {{the rocks}} of the Witwatersrand Supergroup. It {{acted as a}} palaeo-aquifer and is capped by relatively impermeable metabasalts of the Ventersdorp Supergroup. Three post-depositional alteration events, which form an <b>alteration</b> <b>halo</b> in the footwall and hangjngwall rocks around the VCR, can be recognised. The first of these alteration events is attributed to regional metamorphism and is identified by the formation of pyrophyllite in the footwall quartzites and a lower green schist facies mineral assemblage in the hangingwall metabasalts. The second and third alteration events are interpreted as metasomatic fluid in filtration events which were focused along the VCR horizon. The second alteration event involved K⁺metasomatism which affected the footwall and hanging wall rocks up to a distance of several metres away from the VCR The third alteration event, during which the muscovite was partially replaced, {{was associated with the}} formation of chlorite in and immediately around the VCR-Chlorite thermometry suggests a temperature of 307 ± 14 °C for this event. The close mineralogical association of gold with chlorite, secondary pyrite and secondary quartz in the VCR is interpreted to indicate that gold remobilisation was associated with the chlorite forming alteration event. The inhomogeneity found in gold particles within a hydrothermal quartz vein indicates a sharp drop in temperature after gold precipitation, suggesting {{a very short period of}} hydrothermal fluid infiltration...|$|E

Halli) in the Chitradurga greenstone belt of the western Dharwar craton, southern India. It occurs in the distal <b>alteration</b> <b>halo</b> of the G. R. Halli gold deposit as (a) clusters of very fine grained aggregates which form a minor constituent in the matrix of the altered metabasalt (AMB tourmaline) and (b) in quartz-carbonate veins (vein tourmaline). The vein tourmaline, based upon the association of specific carbonate minerals, is further grouped as (i) albite-tourmaline-ankerite-quartz veins (vein- 1 tourmaline) and (ii) albite-tourmaline-calcite-quartz veins (vein- 2 tourmaline). Both the AMB tourmaline and the vein tourmalines (vein- 1 and vein- 2) belong to the alkali group and are classified under schorl-dravite series. Tourmalines occurring in the veins are zoned while the AMB tourmalines are unzoned.

40|$|In the Neves area, the pre-Alpine {{intrusive}} protolith of the Zentralgneise unit (Tauern window, Eastern Alps) is well {{preserved in}} a kilometric-scale low-strain domain without pervasive Alpine deformation. It is compositionally heterogeneous, consisting predominantly of granodiorites, with lesser leucocratic granites, and different generations of lamprophyres and aplites. The intrusive rocks are crosscut by fractures that were locally infiltrated by fluids {{and surrounded by}} <b>alteration</b> <b>haloes.</b> Incipient Alpine amphibolite facies ductile deformation is strongly localized on these precursor fractures and on lithological planar heterogeneities, resulting {{in the development of}} several different types of shear zones. Fractures without <b>alteration</b> <b>haloes</b> initially accommodate slip entirely on the fracture itself. With increasing deformation, a foliation is progressively developed in the adjacent host rock, eventually producing a single heterogeneous “ductile” shear zone with the typical sigmoidal foliation pattern. Strong layers (aplite dykes and bleached <b>alteration</b> <b>haloes</b> developed to either side of precursor fractures) localize shear on their boundaries to produce characteristic paired shear zones. Shearing is more evenly distributed within weak layers (lamprophyres and quartz veins), with a marked discontinuity in shear strain against the adjacent, little deformed granodiorite. Shear zone development was accompanied by the formation of new fractures and quartz-rich veins in the host rock, which in turn also localized shear. Magmatic contacts, fractures and quartz veins are mostly steeply dipping and effectively span the complete range of strike orientations. The kinematics of the overprinting (strike-slip) shear zones was determined by the orientation of the initial discontinuities relative to the local principal compressive stress axis σ 1 (here oriented ca. 345 °). Discontinuities of almost all orientations show shear reactivation, even in the case of very low resolved shear stress, indicating an overall viscous response of the system without a specific yield stress. The geometry and kinematics of the shear zone network suggest that the overall deformation in low-strain domains was close to coaxial. During deformation along the shear zone network, compatibility was maintained by fracturing (with the development of new quartz veins) and by distributed ductile deformation of the host rock, especially within contractional domains of the shear network and at shear zone intersections. Deformation never propagates into the undeformed homogeneous granodiorite as discrete ductile shear zones but is limited by the original extent of the precursor discontinuities. Shear zone development in intact rock is always preceded by fracturing, which localizes subsequent shear reactivation...|$|R
40|$|The Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity has traversed up section through {{approximately}} 100 m of {{sedimentary rocks}} deposited in fluvial, deltaic, lacustrine, and eolian environments (Bradbury group and overlying Mount Sharp group). The Stimson formation unconformably overlies a lacustrine mudstone {{at the base}} of the Mount Sharp group and has been interpreted to be a cross-bedded sandstone of lithified eolian dunes. Unaltered Stimson sandstone has a basaltic composition similar to the average Mars crustal composition, but is more variable and ranges to lower K and higher Al. Fluids passing through alteration "halos" adjacent to fractures have altered the chemistry and mineralogy of the sandstone. Elemental mass gains and losses in the <b>alteration</b> <b>halos</b> were quantified using immobile element concentrations, i. e., Ti (taus). <b>Alteration</b> <b>halos</b> have elemental gains in Si, Ca, S, and P and large losses in Al, Fe, Mn, Mg, Na, K, Ni, and Zn. Mineralogy of the altered Stimson is dominated by Ca-sulfates, Si-rich X-ray amorphous materials along with plagioclase feldspar, magnetite, and pyroxenes. The igneous phases were less abundant in the altered sandstone with a lower pyroxene/plagioclase feldspar. Large elemental losses suggest acidic fluids initially removed these elements (Al mobile under acid conditions). Enrichments in Si, Ca, and S suggest secondary fluids (possibly alkaline) passed through these fractures leaving behind X-ray amorphous Si and Ca-sulfates. The mechanism for the large elemental gains in P is unclear. The geochemistry and mineralogy of the altered sandstone suggests a complicated diagenetic history with multiple episodes of aqueous alteration under a variety of environmental conditions (e. g., acidic, alkaline) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance spectroscopy to {{the characterization of}} clay minerals in the Athabasca Basin, in Saskatchewan, has been evaluated by detailed examination of 70 mineral separates (20 of kaolinite, 10 of dickite, 19 of illite, 16 of chlorites and 5 of magnesiofoitite). Clay minerals in the Athabasca Basin are widespread in the sandstones and are particularly abundant in <b>alteration</b> <b>haloes</b> associated with unconformity-type U deposits. SEM, TEM, XRD, EMPA, EPR and SWIR analyses confirm that dickite is a major clay mineral in the sandstones. Kaolinite from different geological settings has distinct values of crystallinity (i. e., Hinckley index in the range 0. 84 to 1. 61 in <b>alteration</b> <b>haloes,</b> 0. 45 to 0. 7 in the bleached zones of the paleoregolith, and 0. 12 to 0. 31 in late fractures and cavities). The SWIR reflectance spectroscopy is capable of quantita-tively estimating the crystallinity of kaolinite by using a “ 14 SP Index”. Attempts to use SWIR reflectance spectroscopy for structural and compositional analysis of Athabasca illite and sudoite were complicated by the common occurrence of impurities in these minerals. Binary and ternary mixtures using well-characterized mineral standards reveal that SWIR reflectance spectroscopy is capable of identifying clay minerals at abundances as low as 1 wt%. Also, numerical relationships between spectral features and the abundances of clay minerals have been established from the muscovite – kaolinite, muscovite – dickite and muscovite – sudoite mixtures, and {{have been used to}} improve an empirical SWIR method for quantitative analysis of clay minerals in the Athabasca Basin.

40|$|The {{magnetite}} {{deposits of}} the Turgai belt (Kachar, Sarbai and Sokolov), in the Valerianovskoe {{zone of the}} southern Urals, Kazakhstan, contain a combined resource of over 3 Gt of iron oxide ore. The deposits are hosted by carbonate sediments and volcaniclastic rocks of the Carboniferous Valerianovka Supergroup, and are spatially related to the gabbroic to granitoid composition intrusive rocks of the Sarbai–Sokolov intrusive series. The magnetite deposits are developed dominantly as metasomatic replacement of limestone, but also, to a lesser extent, of volcanic rocks. Pre-mineralisation metamorphism and alteration resulted {{in the formation of}} wollastonite and the silicification of limestone. Magnetite mineralisation is associated with the development of a high temperature skarn assemblage of diopside, grossular–andradite garnet, actinolite, epidote and apatite. Sub-economic copper-bearing sulphide mineralisation overprints the magnetite mineralisation and is associated with deposition of hydrothermal calcite and the formation of an extensive sodium <b>alteration</b> <b>halo</b> dominated by albite and scapolite. Chlorite formation accompanies this stage and further later stage hydrothermal overprints.

Similar to {{previously}} studied rocks from the upper sections of Hole 504 B, the rocks recovered during Leg 148 are mildly to moderately evolved mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) ranging in their MgO concentrations from 7. 8 to 10. 0 wt%. The rocks exhibit {{the same sort of}} depletion as the lavas of Hole 504 B, characterized by very low incompatible element abundances (e. g., TiO 2 = 0. 54 - 1. 03 wt%, Zr = 29 - 53 ppm, and Ce = 2. 2 - 5. 5 ppm). Chondrite-normalized La/Sm and Nb/Zr ratios are markedly lower than average N-MORB, suggesting a highly depleted mantle source. Fractional crystallization of plagioclase, olivine, ± clinopyroxene can account for most of the chemical variability, whereby the degree of fractionation is less than 50 %. The chemical effects of alteration are more difficult to distinguish because they can sometimes have the same consequences as mag-matic differentiation. Formation of chlorite, amphibole, albite-oligoclase, and titanite replacing groundmass and primary min-erals are typical for all samples.

40|$|International audienceAmmonium illite and {{ammonium}} illite-smectite mixed layers, {{together with}} potassium illite, smectite and minute amounts of kaolinite {{were identified in}} hydrothermally altered andesite rocks from the Harghita Ba˜i area of the Eastern Carpathians, Romania. K-Ar dating and oxygen isotope tracing, as well as rare-earth elemental analyses were made to provide new information on the timing and crystal-chemical processes characterizing the crystallization and further evolution of these illite-type mineral phases. The combined results suggest the occurrence of hydrothermal activity in two distinct episodes with nucleation of two generations of illite-type particles of different chemistry and morphology. About 9. 5 Ma ago, potassium illite crystallized in <b>alteration</b> <b>halos</b> of the porphyry Cu system, probably at a temperature of ~ 270 ºC from fluids having a d 18 O of ~ 2. 9 % (V-SMOW). Associated smectite seems to have precipitated slightly later in external <b>alteration</b> <b>halos</b> at a similar temperature, but from fluids depleted in alkalis and with a different d 18 O. Alternately, ammonium-rich illite-smectite mixed layers formed very recently, less than ~ 1 million years ago at a temperature of ~ 90 ºC from fluids of probable meteoric origin that altered the previously crystallized potassium illite, resulting in the crystallization {{of a new generation}} of ammonium illite-smectite mixed layers. Evidence of this dissolution-precipitation process is provided by a significant increase in the d 18 O of the mixed-layer structures and by a significant change in their REE contents and distribution patterns. Occurrence of potassium in the ammonium-rich mixed layers probably relates to the progressive alteration of the first-generation potassium illite and a discrete concomitant take up of released K by the new NH 4 - rich interlayers of the ammonium mixed layered sequence...|$|R
