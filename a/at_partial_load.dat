Bringing 160,00 G.R.T. ships into the port (<b>at</b> <b>partial</b> <b>load</b> capacity) is a considerable accomplishment in view of the fact that the Port of Ashdod was intended for navigation by ships of maximum deadweight of 30,000 tons (before the port was expanded in the 2000s).|$|E

40|$|Wave {{power is}} a large {{untapped}} source of renewable energy. There is {{a wide variety of}} wave energy converters {{and one of them is}} the Symphony Wave Power device. The aim of this thesis is to find the best generator design for the Symphony. There is some research available on generator designs for wave energy converters but the Symphony is a unique case, so a new research needed to be conducted. Several generator types can be used in the Symphony. Compared to an induction and switched reluctance generator, the iron-cored permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) seems a good choice because it is efficient and reliable. A disadvantage, however, is that, in the case of the Symphony, the iron losses are relatively high <b>at</b> <b>partial</b> <b>loads.</b> An air-cored PMSG does not have this problem since it has no iron losses at all. A drawback of the air-cored PMSG is that it needs more permanent magnetic material, which is expensive. Finally, it was decided to test and compare the iron-cored radial flux PMSG and the air-cored axial flux PMSG on both performance and costs. For both generator types, an analytical model was built which puts out the efficiency and material cost. To find the best generator geometries for the case of the Symphony, an optimization procedure was created which minimizes both material costs and losses. It was found that an axial flux air-cored PMSG is both cheaper and more efficient than a radial flux iron-cored PMSG. The iron losses of an iron-cored generator are relatively high <b>at</b> <b>partial</b> <b>loads</b> while the Symphony operates <b>at</b> <b>partial</b> <b>loads</b> most of the time...|$|R

5000|$|Gas turbines, {{another form}} of {{internal}} combustion engine, usually meet an efficiency of 20 to 28 percent at full load with landfill gas. Efficiencies drop when the turbine is operating <b>at</b> <b>partial</b> <b>load.</b> Gas turbines have relatively low maintenance costs and nitrogen oxide emissions when compared to RP engines. Gas turbines require high gas compression, which uses more electricity to compress, therefore reducing the efficiency. Gas turbines are also more resistant to corrosive damage than RP engines. Gas turbines need a minimum of 1,300 cfm and typically exceed 2,100 cfm and can generate 1 to 10 MW. A gas turbine (greater than 3 MW) can typically cost $1,400 per kW with annual {{operation and maintenance costs}} of $130 per kW. [...] Estimates are in 2010 dollars.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{intake valve}} closing (EIVC)Another way to {{decrease}} the pumping losses associated with low engine speed, high vacuum conditions is by closing the intake valve earlier than normal. This involves closing the intake valve midway through the intake stroke. Air/fuel demands are so low at low-load conditions and the work required to fill the cylinder is relatively high, so Early intake valve closing greatly reduces pumping losses. [...] Studies have shown early intake valve closing reduces pumping losses by 40%, and increases fuel economy by 7%. It also reduced nitric oxide emissions by 24% <b>at</b> <b>partial</b> <b>load</b> conditions. A possible downside to early intake valve closing is that it significantly lowers {{the temperature of the}} combustion chamber, which can increase hydrocarbon emissions.|$|E
50|$|Starting from 1996 the Dutch oil and {{gas company}} NAM {{installed}} {{over a period of}} 10 years 20 large E-motor driven (with variable speed drive) gas compressors of 23 MW fully equipped with active magnetic bearings on both the E-motor and the compressor. These compressors are used in the Groningen gas field to extract the remaining gas from this large gas field and to increase the field capacity. The motor-compressor design was done by Siemens and the active magnetic bearings were delivered by Waukesha Bearings (owned by Dover Corporation). (Originally these bearings were designed by Glacier, this company was later taken over by Federal Mogul and is now part of Waukesha Bearings.) By using active magnetic bearings and a direct drive between motor and compressor (without the gearbox in between) and applying dry gas seals, a full dry-dry (oil free) system has been installed. Applying active magnetic bearings in the driver and in the compressor (compared to the traditional configuration with a gearbox, plain bearings and a gasturbine-driver) results in a relatively simple system with a very wide operating range and high efficiencies (particularly <b>at</b> <b>partial</b> <b>load).</b> As done in the Groningen field, the full installation can additionally be placed outdoors without the need for a large compressor building.|$|E

40|$|Induction Motor (IM) drives {{are widely}} used in industrial, commercial, domestic, and other {{applications}} due to their simple robust construction, safe-long trouble free operation with minimum maintenance and wear and tear etc. Maximum efficiency of an IM usually occurs at near full load operation at rated 'voltage. But in many applications these motors are required to operate at other than rated load, where, the efficiency is {{much less than the}} maximum attainable efficiency. To achieve the maximum attainable efficiency at loads other than rated values, it is necessary to regulate the flux level by changing the voltage/frequency suitably at any given motor load. Large IMs usually are fairly highly efficient, compared to small TM. Low efficiency leads to uneconomic use of power in industrial installations. Maximum attainable efficiency operation of an IM <b>at</b> <b>partial</b> <b>loads</b> may be obtained by using a controller which can search for the maximum attainable efficiency condition <b>at</b> the given <b>partial</b> <b>load</b> and then operate the IM at that condition.

50|$|The {{mid-size}} stationary engine-generator {{pictured here}} is a 100 kVA set which produces 415 V at around 110 A. It {{is powered by a}} 6.7-liter turbocharged Perkins Phaser 1000 Series engine, and consumes approximately 27 liters of fuel an hour, on a 400-liter tank. Diesel engines in the UK can run on red diesel and rotate at 1,500 or 3,000 rpm. This produces power at 50 Hz, which is the frequency used in Europe. In areas where the frequency is 60 Hz (United States), generators rotate at 1,800 rpm or another divisor of 3600.

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{analysis of}} a gas-driven NH 3 -H 2 O heat pump whose cycle approaches the GAX concept is carried out. Full load operation is investigated by varying hot water temperatures and <b>partial</b> <b>load</b> operation is investigated by decreasing gas input down to 50 % of the full load value. Numerical simulations bolster measurements accuracy and provide insight on the variation of cycle COP and Gas Utilization Efficiency (GUE), based on gross calorific value. A nearly constant GUE of about 1. 5 is found for hot water temperatures lower than 50 Â°C. The GUE steadily decreases above 50 Â°C, reaching about 1. 33 at 60 Â°C. The COP varies more smoothly, from 1. 73 at 45 Â°C to 1. 60 at 60 Â°C. The GUE and COP reduction at 50 % of the nominal gas input is 6. 8 % and 6. 4 %, respectively.
