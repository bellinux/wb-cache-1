40|$|Abstract Herein is {{presented}} a numerical methodology for a static resistance analysis of symmetrically loaded multiplanar KK joints in circular hollow steel sections. This methodology addresses {{factors related to}} the simulation of KK joints such as the material properties, the boundary conditions, mesh generation and refinement, incremental load steps and failure criteria. An objective criterion is proposed to identify the two failure modes most often occurring in KK joints. Failure mode 1 is observed when two neighboring diagonal <b>braces</b> <b>loaded</b> {{in the same sense}} act as one brace penetrating the chord together. In the failure mode 2, excessive deformation is observed in the chord region between two neighboring braces, folding the chord wall. However, in some cases the failure mode is not easily identified or both failure types are present. The proposed criterion objectively identifies the failure mode. In order to compute the joint resistance, an important failure criterion often adopted in literature for uniplanar K joints is the one known as Lu's deformation. In this paper, a strategy is proposed, which is an extension of Lu's criterion for multiplanar KK joints...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014. The paper {{analyses}} {{the behavior}} of a structure which includes a classically restrained steel column under an axial load and a single flexible brace attached at an arbitrary point along the column to restrict its lateral deformation. The column is assumed to have an initial imperfection limited according to the current code requirements. Focusing on lateral deformations only, the paper studies the maximum load the system can resist before failure, as well as a brace force arisen at this load. Due to the complexity of the problem when it is extended from the elastic region to the plastic domain, a numerical solution is utilized. In the current work, a student version of AbaqusTM provides results of finite-element analysis implemented for a variety of ASTM A 992 steel W-Shaped columns. The results confirm that the failure <b>load</b> and <b>brace</b> force highly depend on brace location and its stiffness.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parametric study of symmetrically loaded multiplanar KK connections in circular hollow steel sections. The connections were designed with {{gaps between the}} diagonal braces. Analyses were performed using the commercial finite element program Ansys. A total of 54 KK connections and their corresponding uniplanar K connections were analyzed and compared {{in terms of the}} connection resistance. A new objective criterion to assess the two failure modes most often occurring in KK connections is proposed. Failure mode 1 is observed when two neighboring diagonal <b>braces</b> <b>loaded</b> in the same sense act as one brace penetrating the chord together. In failure mode 2, excessive deformation is observed in the chord region between two neighboring braces, folding the chord wall. However, in some cases, the failure mode is not easily identified, or both failure types are present The proposed criterion is based on the diametric deformation of the chord and objectively assesses the failure mode. By comparing the connection resistance of KK and K connections as determined using numerical analyses, analytical expressions to predict the connection resistance of KK connections were developed. The expressions accurately predict the connection resistance based on geometric parameters and the resistance of the corresponding uniplanar K connection. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Steel moment-resisting {{frames are}} {{susceptible}} to large lateral displacements during severe earthquake ground motions leading engineers to turn to stiffer concentrically braced frames (CBF) {{as a way to}} resist earthquake <b>loads.</b> <b>Braced</b> framed systems are efficient because the lateral loads are resisted primarily by <b>brace</b> axial <b>loads</b> with little or no bending in the members. Brace behavior, however, is typically controlled by undesireable member buckling behavior. As a result, during cyclic <b>loading,</b> the <b>brace</b> hysteretic behavior is unsymmetric and there is deterioration of the building lateral load behavior. Buckling restrained braces (BRB) and partially buckling restrained braces (PBRB) have been proposed as alternatives to conventional brace design. Both use the steel section more effectively than conventional frames: BRBs achieve stable, symmetric hysteretic behavior by accommodating ductile compression yielding and thus can achieve the full theoretical capacity of the brace in both tension and compression. PBRBs, while not as efficient as BRBs, are ideal for the retrofit of existing braces since they can be built in situ with little impact on the surrounding structure. Additionally, the brace capacity is not affected, thus {{there is no need to}} retrofit the connections or subsequent elements of the force resisting system. The objective of this thesis is to assess the potential design space of PBRBs. A series of analyses of a six story CBFs is conducted. The braces are provided with a range of hysteretic behaviors varying from that of a 'slender' brace to that of a BRB. Between these extremes, 'intermediate' and 'stocky' brace behavior represents the spectra of potential PBRB behavior. It is demonstrated that structural behavior is improved as the braces progressed from slender to stocky to BRB. The incremental improvement is most significant as one improves upon slender behavior and becomes less pronounced as the brace slenderness is reduced. This result is encouraging for the use of PBRBs as a retrofit measure for slender braces...|$|R
