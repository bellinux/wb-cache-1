The union promoted the ideas of development of industry - lowering taxes, social security benefits for workers, and increasing state <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>industry.</b> Members of the organization were elected to the Sejm, the Senate, were members of governments of the Second Republic of Poland, and served other state institutions. They published three magazines: Economic Review (Przegląd Gospodarczy), The Polish Courier (Kurier Polski), and The Telegram (Depesza). Stanisław Sebastian {{established the}} Industrial Bank of Warsaw SA (Bank Przemysłowy Warszawski S.A.) and was the president of the Commercial Bank (Bank Handlowy) in Warsaw, the Central Union of Polish Industry (Centralny Związek Przemysłu Polskiego), the Polish Bank Association (Związek Banków Polskich), and the Association of Polish Industrialists (Stowarzyszenie Przemysłowców Polskich). He devoted his life to the struggle for the independence of the Polish economy from the influence of the partitioners, and, after regaining independence, from that of neighbouring countries.|$|E

We show that states and regions are becoming more specialized within the EU, but this process is very slow. While {{there is no evidence}} of polarization occurring at the national level, some regions are losing out. National state <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> <b>industry</b> appear <b>to</b> have little effect for either good or ill, since their effectiveness at attracting economic activity and employment is limited. European Structural Funds expenditure, by contrast, does have an effect on {{the location of}} industry, notably by attracting industries that are intensive in research and development. However, this effect has mostly been acting counter to states' comparative advantage - R&D-intensive industries have been encouraged by these <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> locate in countries and regions that have low endowments of skilled labour. Only in Ireland, where Structural Funds reinforced rather than offset comparative advantage, have poor regions been enabled systematically to catch up with the EU average.

40|$|Greek exceptionalism is a claim widely made in {{comparative}} politics.

While Greece behaves differently in the cases of sectoral and regional subsidies, the “outlier” effect disappears in the case of sectoral subsidies once the impact of Simitis’ government and economic development are taken into account.

40|$|The {{conventional}} academic {{rationale for}} supranational intervention <b>to</b> curb state <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> <b>industry</b> appeals <b>to</b> transfrontier spillovers. However, competition policy practitioners often speak {{in terms of}} curbing "wasteful" spending, {{regardless of whether or}} not any international spillovers are involved. Although it is often argued that such wasteful spending calls not for supranational state aid control but rather for better domestic political accountability, this paper argues that wasteful spending may be a by-product of accountability, not a symptom of its absence. Specifically, we describe a model in which politicians fund projects that are wasteful as a way to signal their diligence, and voters rationally reward them for this. We discuss implications for the role of state aid control mechanisms. © 2006 by the European Economic Association. SCOPUS: cp. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The United States {{government}} {{has provided a}} range of assistance <b>to</b> help troubled <b>industries.</b> Such aid {{is of particular interest}} in debates over in- dustrial or competitiveness policy and in thinking about how effectively American government intervenes in the "micro economy. " The experience of <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> one <b>industry,</b> the New England fisheries, suggests that programs fail to achieve their ends for three major reasons. First, industry spokesmen and government officials have difficulty understanding the cause of in- dustry problems. Second, programs fail when they are inappropriate ap- proaches to solving the problems. Third, many programs have implementation difficulties. Findings on other industries suggest that the same kinds of problems interfere with the success of other programs. If government efforts <b>to</b> help <b>industries</b> often fail in ways that are somewhat predictable, then Congress and federal agencies should make the assistance more effective by taking specific steps. These efforts to improve programs, however, are problematic themselves and will not ensure success. Copyright 1990 by The Policy Studies Organization. ...|$|R
