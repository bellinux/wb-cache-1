25|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions {{at the beginning of}} most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better concentrate on {{what is going on in}} the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to guess what will happen next. For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E

Therefore, {{people who do not}} stop to look at the poem itself or to study the images in the poem <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> the poem really says, are inclined to accept the poem because of the pious sentiment, the prettified little pictures (which in themselves appeal to stock responses), and the mechanical rhythm." ...|$|E
500|$|Natasha starts dating Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) and she {{believes}} that they are perfect for each other. Novakovic said that they [...] "bring out the worst in each other" [...] and added [...] "I don't think she could find a guy that would tolerate her like Andrew does. She thinks he's the only guy she could possibly be with." [...] Natasha thinks that school and studying is not cool and is happy that Andrew feels the same, until Summer Hoyland joins their class and Andrew becomes interested in his studies. Natasha fears that she could lose her control over Andrew. Summer later asks Natasha {{if there is anything}} else, other than the physical aspect, to her relationship with Andrew. Novakovic says that [...] "Natasha is furious, but it does make her stop <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> she is doing." [...] Natasha does begin to have her doubts about the relationship and she decides to test Andrew, by telling him she wants their relationship to have to be about communicating and understanding each other. Andrew does not take the new direction of the relationship well. Novakovic said that Natasha believes the relationship between her neighbours, Susan (Jackie Woodburne) and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), is something to be inspired by. She added [...] "That's what she wants to look forward to, but she's getting way ahead of herself. Andrew likes her but he isn't as serious as she is." [...] Novakovic opined that Andrew and Natasha [...] "bring out the worst in each other" [...] and that Natasha's relationship with Andrew had been one of her favourite storylines.|$|E

2500|$|Patrik Lindén, {{spokesman}} for EURid at the time, denied the allegations by Parsons, stating that [...] " [...] verified that each registrar was an individual legal entity. Each {{had to sign}} an agreement with us, and prepay €10,000." [...] Parsons didn't dispute that each registrar was a separate legal entity, but noted that creating such entities was trivial: [...] "Mr. Linden seemed proud that the EURid registry verified that each applicant was a legal entity before it was accredited. Take a moment <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> that means. You can form a “legal entity” for $50 – an LLC – and you are good to go. Is that what we want a registry to do? Don’t we want them instead {{to make sure that}} the organization it allows to provide end-users with its domain names – especially Europe’s very own domain name – are actually in the domain name registration business?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Weill {{also contributed}} {{greatly to the}} Verfremdungseffekt by his music. Often the music would {{intentionally}} be unsuited for the onstage action, preventing the audience from getting carried away by the onstage emotion. For example, in act 2, scene 13, the hurricane has spared Mahagonny, and the people feel free to do whatever makes them happy. For Jacob Schmidt, this means eating a lot. He sings of how he has not had his fill yet with such lines as [...] "Not enough by half! / I may eat myself for supper." [...] And yet, the music betrays the seeming unbridled ecstasy of Jacob; he is singing to a discordant melody, and the accordion accompaniment sounds stark and rather macabre. The intention is that the audience realizes that all this is very wrong; Jacob claims {{to be having a}} great time, but the music suggests all may not be well, thus the audience needs to pay attention <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> is really going on. To further this point, Jacob then dies and the chorus sings of how happy he was while dragging out his corpse. This last twist of welcoming death is unexpected and contributes to the alienation.|$|E
2500|$|At his {{arraignment}} at the District Court of Pittsburg County on June 4, 2002, Duty asked Judge Steven Taylor {{to enter}} a guilty plea to the murder and requested the death penalty, {{against the advice of}} his defense counsel. On October 28 of that year, Duty was deemed competent to enter the plea after court-ordered evaluations by the Carl Albert Community Mental Health Center and Eastern Oklahoma State Hospital. While testifying on his own behalf, Duty declined to present any mitigating evidence and said that he preferred death over spending a life sentence in lockdown 23 hours day. He also wrote to the prosecutor that he would kill again. Mary Wise pleaded to the court to sentence Duty to life in prison without the possibility of parole, stating: [...] "I don't believe he ought to have a choice. I think he ought to sit in that cell and face those four walls <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> he did {{for the rest of his}} natural-born life. And I hope and pray to God that you live to be 110 years old, because that's how long I want you to think about what you did." [...] Judge Taylor denied her request, calling Duty a [...] "textbook case for the death penalty". Duty was initially scheduled to be executed on February 24, 2005.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Participatory Sensing {{enables us}} to build a large {{platform}} for wide-area sensing by utilizing cellphones as sensor nodes. One of the main problems in the participatory sensing is the high power consumption on a cellphone because of the limitation of its battery. In this paper, we propose a low power data transport protocol, which is called as Piggyback Transport Protocol (PBTP). The PBTP utilizes the user think time to upload sensor data. In the user think time, a user watches the display <b>and</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> should he or she do next. The PBTP uploads sensor data in the inactivity timer period on the user think time. The inactivity timer period represents the cellphone has connection to a base station, but does not communicate to the base station. The paper evaluates the PBTP with simulation, and the result shows PBTP reduces power consumption compared to the previous work. I...|$|R
