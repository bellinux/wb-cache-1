The reason {{is the idea of}} mounting all the outer gimbal axes of the CMGs parallel to each other. This allows the decomposition of the steering law problem into a linear one for the inner gimbal <b>angle</b> <b>rates</b> and a planar one for the outer gimbal <b>angle</b> <b>rates.</b> The inner gimbal <b>angle</b> <b>rates</b> are calculated first, since they are not affected by the outer gimbal <b>angle</b> <b>rates.</b> For the calculation of the outer rates, the inner rates are then known quantities.

5000|$|After the {{cancellation}} of the Arrow program in 1959, Maynard {{was one of the}} group of top Avro engineers who were [...] "loaned" [...] to the newly formed NASA's Space Task Group, in Langley, Virginia, to work on Project Mercury. (Later, after moving to Houston, this group formed the core of what became NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center, later renamed the Johnson Space Center.) Initially assigned to be Project Engineer for the first flight-test Mercury capsule. Among other activities in that role, he participated in the recovery of the Mercury-Atlas 1 capsule from the sea-floor following the failure of its launch vehicle. During the recovery operations, he performed a 30-foot free-dive to find one particular missing component of the capsule. He stated in an official interview that during the subsequent launch failure review process, his post-flight calculations showed the skin of the launch vehicle just below the spacecraft would have buckled, due to the combined drag and bending loads at the max-Q point exceeding the tensile stress in the skin due to internal pressure. Based on that finding, the NASA specified that future Mercury-Atlas launch vehicles add doublers to the skin structure in that area, and that future launch trajectories be shallowed to reduce pitch <b>angle</b> <b>rate,</b> to reduce the bending stress on the launch vehicle. This failure mode did not recur on those subsequent launches.|$|E
5000|$|The initial {{suspicion}} {{was that}} the fiberglass fairing placed {{on top of the}} capsule to sit in place of the absent LES had broken loose and punctured the Atlas's LOX tank. NASA's Owen Maynard, who was involved in Mercury systems engineering, led the recovery of the MA-1 capsule from the sea-floor (in which he performed a 30-foot free-dive to find one particular missing component of the capsule). He stated in an oral history interview that his post-flight calculations showed the skin of the launch vehicle just below the spacecraft would have buckled due to the combined drag, acceleration, and bending loads which exceeded the resisting tensile stress in the skin provided by internal pressure. Maynard recalled that [...] "The problem of mating the Mercury capsule to the Atlas was far from being properly resolved at the time of MA-1." [...] Based on that finding, the NASA specified that future Mercury-Atlas launch vehicles add doublers to the skin structure in that area, and that future launch trajectories be shallowed to reduce pitch <b>angle</b> <b>rate,</b> to reduce the bending stress on the launch vehicle. In fact, Atlas 50D already had slightly thicker skin than Big Joe's booster (Atlas 10D) but only on the RP-1 tank while the LOX tank still had the standard thin-gauge Atlas ICBM skin. This failure mode did not recur on those subsequent launches. There were also suspicions that the lack of a launch escape system had negatively affected the booster's aerodynamic profile. Convair engineers had argued that including the LES was necessary both from an aerodynamic standpoint and for data-gathering purposes, but Mercury program officials ultimately ruled against it.|$|E
