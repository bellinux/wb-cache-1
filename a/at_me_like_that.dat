2500|$|In December, popular US teen website Pop Dust called [...] "Want U Back" [...] the 25th Best Song of 2012. They {{wrote about}} it saying [...] "An entire {{timeline}} of Stockholm Syndrome in three-and-a-half minutes: Who is this manic muppet, and why is she grunting? Does she know he doesn’t want her back? At least she’s honest about her brattiness though, that’s refreshing. Do you think she’s in on the joke? Huh, it’s over already? OK, maybe just one more listen. Wait, why can’t I get her voice out of my head? Rimembah ol {{the things that you}} an’ oi did fuhst? No, stop looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> I’m just doing my Cher Lloyd impression".|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't let him hit me! Oh, please don't let him hit me! I've {{been hit}} cruel to-day because I {{spoke to a}} man. Don't let him look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that!</b> He's reg'lar wicked, that one. Don't let him look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> neither! Oh, I feel as if I hadn't nothing on when {{he looks at me}} like that!' ...|$|E
60|$|DOOLITTLE. Can {{you blame}} the girl? Don't look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> Eliza. It ain't my fault. I've come into money.|$|E
6000|$|Gwendolen. Yes, but {{men often}} propose for practice. I know my brother Gerald does. All my girl-friends tell me so. What wonderfully blue eyes you have, Ernest! They are quite, quite, blue. I {{hope you will}} always look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> just <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> {{especially}} when {{there are other people}} present. [Enter Lady Bracknell.] ...|$|R
5000|$|Another slight {{variation}} {{occurs in}} the final lines, when Helene accepts Harry's proposal of marriage and says, [...] "I hope that after we marry, you'll always look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> just <b>like</b> this... especially in front of other people!" [...] In the original play by Oscar Wilde, the line is, [...] "I hope you will always look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> just <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> especially when {{there are other people}} present." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] conceded Peter reluctantly, [...] "she wasn't pretty--but {{she looked}} like the woman in that picture the Story Girl's father sent her last week--the one with the shiny ring round her head and the baby in her lap. I've seen Aunt Jane look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> just <b>like</b> <b>that</b> woman looks at her baby. Ma never looks so. Poor ma is too busy washing. I wish I could dream of my Aunt Jane. I never do." ...|$|R
60|$|Why are you {{all looking}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that?</b> You look {{as if you were}} going to try me for something.|$|E
6000|$|... "You want something," [...] she {{answered}} sharply and suspiciously. [...] "Don't look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Speak to me--tell {{me what you}} want." ...|$|E
60|$|ENID. [Rising.] Oh! that's not true! {{the poor}} thing's heart---- What {{makes you look}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that?</b> I tried to help her.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996 Valdobrev {{married his}} high school love Jana. [...] "We have many shared {{memories}} as childhood sweethearts in Stara Zagora. We were 10 when we first met. Our parents were coming back from an excursion, we {{got off the bus}} at the same station and headed in different directions. After a few meters I stopped and turned to look back. She had stopped too and was looking <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> We stood <b>like</b> <b>that</b> for a few moments, staring at each other, our parents holding our hands. Growing up with someone's memories and making that journey through adulthood together is probably what makes a relationship strong. No one knows me better than Jana." [...] In 1998 Jana gave birth to their daughter Maria. Three weeks after that Valdobrev had a terrible car accident that almost cost him his life and kept him immovable and out of action for a year. For that reason he couldn’t join Regis Wargnier’s Oscar-nominated film production East/West, for which he'd been cast to play opposite Catherine Deneuve and Sandrine Bonnaire.|$|R
