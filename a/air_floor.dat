40|$|A {{parallel}} method enabling {{acceleration of the}} numerical analysis of the transient temperature field in an <b>air</b> <b>floor</b> heating system is presented in this paper. An initial-boundary value problem of the heater regulated by an on/off controller is formulated. The analogue model is discretized using the implicit finite difference method. The BiCGStab method is used to compute the obtained system of equations. A computer program implementing simultaneous computations on CPUand GPU(GPGPUtechnology) was developed. CUDA environment and linear algebra libraries (CUBLAS and CUSPARSE) are used by this program. The time of computations was reduced eight times in comparison with a program executed on the CPU only. Results of computations are presented {{in the form of}} time profiles and temperature field distributions. An influence of a model of the heat transfer coefficient on the simulation of the system operation was examined. The physical interpretation of obtained results is also presented.

40|$|A heat {{transfer}} {{model has been}} developed for a naturally ventilated greenhouse under the tropical climatic conditions. In the tropical region, greenhouses are characterized by high exposure in solar radiation and air exchange through natural ventilation. Therefore in this research, incident angle of solar radiation on the greenhouse roof surface has been considered as an important factor to improve the accuracy in calculating the radiation received by the greenhouse. The {{heat transfer}} model consists of four layers represent the cover, inside <b>air,</b> <b>floor</b> surface and soil layers of the greenhouse. The model was applied to a naturally ventilated standard-peak greenhouse. A computer program was developed to predict {{the temperature of the}} inside air. Incident angle of direct solar radiation on roof surface and outside microclimate parameters data were used as the input values. Heat transfer equations were solved by using the Runge-Kutta Method while the angle of direct solar radiation with the roof surface was calculated by using the principles of geometry. Results show that the model performed well in predicting the temperature of the inside air as compared to that of the measure value...|$|E

A field study was conducted that enrolled 139 households from California, which has had more stringent flame retardant requirements than other countries and areas. The study collected passive <b>air,</b> <b>floor</b> and indoor window surface wipes, and dust samples (investigator collected using an HVS 3 and vacuum cleaner) in each home. PentaBDE and BDE 209 were detected {{in the majority of}} the dust samples and many floor wipe samples, but the detection in air and window wipe samples was relatively low. Concentrations of each PBDE congener in different indoor environmental media were moderately correlated, with correlation coefficients ranging between 0. 42 and 0. 68. Correlation coefficients with blood levels were up to 0. 65 and varied between environmental media and age group. Both investigator-collected dust and floor wipes were correlated with serum levels {{for a wide range of}} congeners. These two sample types also had a relatively high fraction of samples with adequate mass for reliable quantification. In 42 homes, PBDE levels measured in the same environmental media in the same home 120 year apart were statistically correlated (correlation coefficients: 0. 57 - 0. 90), with the exception of BDE 209 which was not well correlated longitudinally.

40|$|In Flanders, a {{shift of}} the {{distribution}} of mastitis pathogens towards coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and coliforms in dairy cattle has been observed in recent years. This may partially explain the recent problems of increasing bulk milk somatic cell counts, decreasing milk quality or both. To clarify the complex relationships between different factors explaining the mastitis status of cows and quarters and their evolutions in time, the following protocol and research tools were developed and optimized. Ten randomly selected dairy cows of six Flemish dairy herds (n= 60) are monitored during one year. For comparison, three farms with and three without former specific coliform problems are included in the study. On this farms udder health is observed and potential environmental or animal related risk factors are monthly assessed at three different levels (farm, cow and quarter). Teat swabs, quarter milk samples and barn samples (<b>air,</b> <b>floor,</b> bedding materials, feces) are cultured for presence of mastitis bacteria. Molecular identification and typing techniques are used to detect CNS strains and to identify the main sources of CNS infections. At farm level the milking process is monitored by on the one hand, a monthly technical review of the milking machine and on the other hand, by a video controlled milking routine registration. Information on additional management factors is registered using a questionnaire. Additionally climatic variations (temperature, humidity, gas concentrations, dust) in the barn are investigated with innovative instruments. At cow level, zootechnical information (age, parity, oestrus, pregnancy, production) is complemented with records of cleanliness, body condition, gait and milking characteristics. At the quarter level, the conformation, teat apex condition and cleanliness of the teats are observed with an image processing program developed in Halcon (Halcon 8. 0, MVTec Software GmbH, München, Germany). All of the presented measurement methods have been developed and optimised for routine detection and have been proven to be robust enough for monthly monitoring...|$|E

40|$|The {{insecticide}} DDT {{is still}} used in {{specific areas of}} South Africa for indoor residual spray (IRS) to control malaria vectors. Local residents could be exposed to residues of DDT through various pathways including indoor air, dust, soil, food and water. The aims {{of this study were}} to determine the levels of DDT contamination, as a result of IRS, in representative homesteads, and to evaluate the possible routes of human exposure. Two villages, exposed (DV) and reference (TV) were selected. Sampling was done two months after the IRS process was completed. Twelve homesteads were selected in DV and nine in TV. Human serum, indoor <b>air,</b> <b>floor</b> dust, outside soil, potable water, leafy vegetables, and chicken samples (muscle, fat and liver) were collected and analyzed for both the o,p′- and p,p′-isomers of DDT, DDD and DDE. DDT was detected in all the media analyzed indicating a combination of potential dietary and non-dietary pathways of uptake. DV had the most samples with detectable levels of DDT and its metabolites, and with the exception of chicken muscle samples, DV also had higher mean levels for all the components analyzed compared to TV. Seventy-nine percent of participants from DV had serum levels of DDT (meanΣDDT 7. 3 μg g− 1 lipid). These residues constituted mainly of p,p′-DDD and p,p′-DDE. ΣDDT levels were detected in all indoor air (mean ΣDDT 3900. 0 ng m− 3) and floor dust (meanΣDDT 1200. 0 μg m− 2) samples. Levels were also detected in outside soil (mean ΣDDT 25. 0 μg kg− 1) and potable water (mean ΣDDT 2. 0 μg L− 1). Vegetable sample composition (meanΣDDT 43. 0 μg kg− 1) constituted mainly p,p′-DDT and p,p′-DDD. Chicken samples were highly contaminated with DDT (muscle mean ΣDDT 700. 0 μg kg− 1, fat mean ΣDDT 240, 000. 0 μg kg− 1, liver mean ΣDDT 1600. 0 μg kg− 1).

40|$|Enterobacter spp. are Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped, and non-sporeforming {{bacteria}} {{belonging to}} the Enterobacteriaceae family. Enterobacter spp. have achieved a relevant clinical significance as opportunistic bacterial microorganisms and have overcome as an outstanding nosocomial pathogens in Intensive Care Units. The longer they persist under dry or nutrient-limited conditions (<b>air,</b> <b>floors</b> or in fomites), the longer they may {{be a source of}} transmission and thus endanger a susceptible patient or a healthcare worker. Between the responsible mechanisms that could allow these nosocomial pathogens to persist with these stress conditions are their ability to form biofilms and to resist desiccation. According to this hypothesis, we investigated the fitness of eighteen Enterobacter spp. clinical isolates evaluating its survival under desiccation and low-nutrient concentration (stress conditions that simulate the environmental conditions in a hospital setting). Moreover, we assessed the virulence of some strains challenged with these stress conditions in the Galleria mellonella infection model. As a result, we conclude that Enterobacter spp. have the capability to survive on dry surfaces without losing their virulence and biofilm-forming property, which may have a role in indirect transmission, therefore indicating that regular cleaning and disinfection in hospitals should {{be an integral part of}} strategies to reduce the spread of resistant Enterobacter spp. Máster en Biología Molecular y Biomedicin...|$|R
