40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to show the {{importance}} of the business contexts of individual countries to understand corporate <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> in international settings. Using data from five countries, we show that while agency theory constructs are effective in explaining <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> in corporate settings that have a strong agency orientation, such as that of the United States, it is necessary to go beyond such constructs to understand <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> in other corporate settings. Given the variety of international business settings, we use a generic theory, institutional theory. To conduct this examination into cross-country <b>accounting</b> <b>practices,</b> we focus on an earnings quality measure based on accrual <b>accounting</b> <b>practices,</b> the abnormal accruals component of accounting earnings. We provide evidence to support the view that with varying business settings we are likely to see diversity in <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> that result in different levels of accruals or accruals based earnings quality. 34 page(s...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the attitudes of accountants concerning the acceptability of 14 questionable <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> from the amount of material and immaterial perspectives. The results show that, for all 14 questionable <b>accounting</b> <b>practices,</b> the differences in acceptability between the amount of materiality and immateriality were all statistically significant. Regarding the amount of immateriality, especially for questionable, but still legal <b>accounting</b> <b>practices,</b> accountants appear to have the higher average level of acceptability under the extreme pressure from the top management. While questionable <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> are clearly illegal, no matter what the amount is material or immaterial, accountants appear to have the lowest average level of acceptability. This finding may be helpful for businesses and professional associations as they develop their own policies, standards and educational programs regarding dealing with questionable <b>accounting</b> <b>practices...</b>|$|R

5|$|S.S.C. Napoli was {{expelled}} from the professional league in 2004. Thanks to Article 52 of N.O.I.F., the sports title was transferred to Napoli Soccer (later the new Napoli) in the same year, while the old Napoli was liquidated. On the eve of bankruptcy, the club was in deep financial trouble to achieve positive operating income (excluding windfall profit from players trading). At that time the club was using cash plus player swap to boost short term profit (€28,329,090 in 2000–01; €17,721,534 in 2001–02 season), but also increased the long term cost (as amortization) by purchasing players. In the second last season before bankruptcy, the club was partially saved by the non-standard <b>accounting</b> <b>practice</b> of amortization. {{it was due to}} Silvio Berlusconi, owner of Milan and prime minister of Italy, introducing Italian Law 91/1981, Article 18B. Napoli dramatically reduced the amortization from €33,437,075 to €1,659,088 + €4,660,123, due to €46,601,225 of the intangible asset (player contracts), which was deferred to amortize in 10-year installments, instead of varying from 1 to 5 years by the length of player contract. However, the practice was unable to save the club from the financial aid from a sugar daddy, when the owner withdrew.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} has investigated the current application of management <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> in Saudi and non-Saudi manufacturing firms that {{operate in the}} Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, and {{the internal and external}} contingent aspects that prompted these firms to adopt or not to adopt advanced management <b>accounting</b> <b>practices.</b> In order to achieve the aforementioned aims, a mixed methodology was used, with a questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews being used as instruments for collecting the required data. Three types of statistical analysis were used (descriptive, bivariate and multivariate) to analyse the data obtained from the returned questionnaires (158 out of 260). Analysis of the descriptive parts of the questionnaires has shown that Saudi and non-Saudi manufacturing firms are still loyal to their traditional management <b>accounting</b> <b>practices,</b> such as the extensive use of one accounting system for several purposes, traditional allocation methods, traditional decision-making tools, standard costing systems, traditional budgeting, and traditional financial measures. At the same time, the analysis has shown that there is slow move toward adopting new trends in management accounting among these firms, mainly due to satisfaction with traditional management <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> and a lack of relevant skill regarding the advanced management <b>accounting</b> <b>practices.</b> The bivariate results have shown that adoption of advanced management <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> by Saudi and non-Saudi manufacturing firms is subject to certain contingent aspects, such as perceived environmental uncertainty, competition, size and firm strategy, but not product range or number. The same statistical test has shown that there is a partial relationship between the extent of adoption of advanced management <b>accounting</b> <b>practices,</b> culture, and advanced manufacturing technologies. The results of the multivariate test have shown that adoption of advanced management <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> by Saudi and non-Saudi manufacturing firms is related to only three predictors, which are size, number of products, and prospector strategy. Theoretical analysis of the interviews has revealed that adoption of advanced management <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> is due to perceived environmental uncertainty, price and quality competition, size, number of products, culture, and firm strategy, but not advanced manufacturing technology. Also, analysis of the interviews has confirmed the descriptive finding regarding the heavy use of traditional management <b>accounting</b> <b>practices.</b> The research concludes by emphasising that the case of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia follows the mainstream in regards to the limited acceptance of advanced management <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> and the fact that adoption of these practices is due to certain internal and external contingent drivers...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the extent to which Portuguese local {{entities}} have implemented a set of environmental <b>accounting</b> <b>practices,</b> and to analyse some potential determining factors of their use. Design/methodology/approach – The data were collected by sending a postal questionnaire to a sample of medium-sized and large city councils and the municipal companies belonging to those municipalities. Three variables were considered as possible factors that drive the development of environmental <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> in the local public sector. Findings – The degree of development of environmental <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> in Portuguese local entities is low. Organisational size and the degree of development of environmental management practices are positively and statistically related to the level of development of environmental <b>accounting</b> <b>practices.</b> However, the findings suggest that the existence of compulsory environmental accounting standards is not positively associated with the development of environmental <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> by Portuguese local entities. Research limitations/implications – The study limits itself to Portugal and, therefore, its results could not be applicable in other settings. Practical implications – Portugal is experiencing a phase of development of regulatory environmental disclosure requirements. Understanding the environmental <b>accounting</b> and reporting <b>practices</b> currently developed by Portuguese local entities, as well as their drivers, may help regulators to develop more suitable standards for the sector.
