5|$|According to the Bureau of Immigration, 54,057 Armenians {{entered the}} US between 1899 and 1917. The top listed {{countries}} of origin were Turkey (46,474), Russia (3,034), Canada (1,577), Great Britain (914) and Egypt (894). Immigrants {{were asked to indicate}} which state they were going to settle in; for Armenians, the most popular <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> New York (17,391), Massachusetts (14,192), Rhode Island (4,923), Illinois (3,313), California (2,564), New Jersey (2,115), Pennsylvania (2,002), Michigan (1,371). The largest Armenian American communities at that time were located in New York City; Fresno; Worcester, Massachusetts; Boston; Philadelphia; Chicago; Jersey City; Detroit; Los Angeles; Troy, New York; and Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, Fermi {{continued}} {{teaching at the}} University of Chicago. His PhD students in the post-war period included Owen Chamberlain, Geoffrey Chew, Jerome Friedman, Marvin Goldberger, Tsung-Dao Lee, Arthur Rosenfeld and Sam Treiman. Jack Steinberger was a graduate student. Fermi conducted important research in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons. He made the first predictions of pion-nucleon resonance, relying on statistical methods, since he reasoned that exact <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> not required when the theory was wrong anyway. In a paper co-authored with Chen Ning Yang, he speculated that pions might actually be composite particles. The idea was elaborated by Shoichi Sakata. It has since been supplanted by the quark model, in which the pion {{is made up of}} quarks, which completed Fermi's model, and vindicated his approach.|$|E
25|$|Three {{teams of}} two contestants (namely Red, Yellow and Purple) were spotted $500 ($300 {{in the first}} few episodes) to begin the game with. Correct <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> worth $50, and {{incorrect}} <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> penalized by that amount. After two rounds, the team in third place was eliminated, {{and at the end of}} the last round, only one team prevailed.|$|E
50|$|If {{any other}} {{contestant}} {{thinks that the}} contestant's <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> wrong, he/she can challenge that particular contestant, receiving double runs if the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> correct, but losing double runs if the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> wrong.|$|R
50|$|Only one <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> accepted, {{from the}} first player to provide one. If the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> correct, five points are awarded to the player giving it. If the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> incorrect, the player's {{opponent}} receives three points.|$|R
50|$|After no correct <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> {{given by}} viewers, the correct <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> {{revealed}} to be 292.|$|R
25|$|During the yarchei kallah, the gaon laid {{before the}} {{assembly}} {{a number of}} the questions that had been sent in during the year {{from all parts of the}} Diaspora. The requisite <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> discussed, and were finally recorded by the secretary of the academy according to the directions of the gaon. At the end of the yarchei kallah the questions, together with the <b>answers,</b> <b>were</b> read to the assembly, and the <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> signed by the gaon. A large number of the geonic responsa originated in this way; but many of them were written by the respective Geonim without consulting the kallah assemblies convened in the spring.|$|E
25|$|Though the <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> {{considered}} satisfactory, the Quraysh did not {{convert to}} Islam.|$|E
25|$|The gold {{standard}} materials, without <b>answers,</b> <b>were</b> released to participants, who {{then had a}} short time to run their programs over them and return their sets of answers to the organizers.|$|E
50|$|Memory - The {{players have}} to take it turns to name things of a list {{relating}} to the chosen subject. The round ends when an incorrect <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> given, an <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> repeated or if no <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> given within 5 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|Each <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> {{accompanied}} by a picture or icon of the character to which the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> attributed.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Answer</b> <b>is</b> B: a {{multiple}} choice quiz where the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> always the second option [...] "B".|$|R
25|$|On Match Game PM, a {{third round}} was added {{after the first}} season as games proved to be too short to fill the half-hour. Again, the only celebrities who played were {{those who did not}} match that {{contestant}} in previous rounds. In Match Game PM, the questions with the most obvious <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> typically used in the third round.|$|E
25|$|Two contestants competed. The {{object was}} {{to remove the}} digits 1 through 9 from a game board by rolling an {{oversized}} pair of dice. In order to determine who gained control of the dice, the host asked a toss-up question. The <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> usually multiple choice, true/false, or yes/no. The first contestant to buzz in received the chance to answer, and answering correctly won control. If that contestant did not answer correctly, control went to the opponent.|$|E
25|$|All those <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> truthful, {{although}} {{the second one}} is not a direct answer to the question. It would later be discovered that Bronston personally had had an account with International Credit Bank in Geneva, on which he made deposits and drew checks totalling up to $180,000 during the five years in which the company was active and closed just before the bankruptcy filing. As a result, the matter was referred to federal prosecutors, who secured a perjury indictment against Bronston.|$|E
50|$|An animal {{question}} with two possible <b>answers</b> <b>was</b> asked {{to the players}} by {{an employee of the}} San Diego Zoo. After the question was read, the players held up signs with either one of the answers on them, then the <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> revealed. A correct <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> also worth 10 points.|$|R
50|$|Round 2: Both of {{the contestants}} faced three glasses of water, they must {{calculate}} {{how much water}} in these glasses in grams (They had a margin of 3 grams). Marco's <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> 276 g, actually 273.7 g; but Yang's <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> 498 g, the actual <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> 493.6 g. Marco won Round 2.|$|R
25|$|In most quiz bowl competitions, {{players and}} coaches may protest the moderator's {{decision}} if they believe their <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> incorrectly rejected, or an opponent's <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> incorrectly accepted.|$|R
25|$|In February 1927, {{with the}} {{co-operation}} of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), V. J. Woolley {{who was at}} the time the Research Officer for the SPR, arranged a telepathy experiment in which radio listeners were asked to take part. The experiment involved 'agents' thinking about five selected objects in an office at Tavistock Square, whilst listeners on the radio were asked to identify the objects from the BBC studio at Savoy Hill. 24, 659 <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> received. The results revealed no evidence for telepathy.|$|E
25|$|Bilateral {{conflicts}} {{also exist}} with Bulgaria, mainly related to conflicting {{views about the}} two countries' shared 19th- and 20th-century history and the ethnic separateness of the two nations. Bulgaria joined the EU on 1 January 2007. In July 2006, Bulgarian foreign minister Ivaylo Kalfin and president Georgi Parvanov stated that Bulgaria's support for Macedonian membership might not be unconditional, citing concerns over negative and aggressive attitudes against Bulgaria and Bulgarian history fostered by the Macedonian authorities. Defiant <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> reported from the Macedonian political leadership.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{was among}} the first {{national}} governments to set up an official blog. Under David Saranga, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs became active in adopting Web 2.0 initiatives, including an official video blog and a political blog. The Foreign Ministry also held a microblogging press conference via Twitter about its war with Hamas, with Saranga answering questions from the public in common text-messaging abbreviations during a live worldwide press conference. The questions and <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> later posted on IsraelPolitik, the country's official political blog.|$|E
50|$|The duel {{is worth}} 10 points. Just like the French show, only one <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> accepted, {{but if the}} <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> wrong the other player gets 10 points.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sire, {{bear with}} me. If I speak in heat, I speak in zeal. You {{ask me what}} I wish: my <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> a {{national}} existence, which we have not. You ask me what I wish: my <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> the Land of Promise. You ask me what I wish: my <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> Jerusalem. You ask me what I wish: my <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> the Temple, all we have forfeited, all we have yearned after, all for which we have fought, our beauteous country, our holy creed, our simple manners, and our ancient customs.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Each correct <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> {{added to}} a video wall above the contestants' heads, placed so that they cannot see it. These <b>answers</b> <b>are</b> used for all {{questions}} in subsequent rounds.|$|R
25|$|While {{government}} officials in India cite full cooperation by U.S. authorities, the opposition parties and others in India have demanded explanations of why Headley was allowed to travel freely for years between India, Pakistan, and the U.S., and why he was working undercover for the DEA. Some Indian analysts have speculated that David Headley was a double agent for the Central Intelligence Agency that had infiltrated LeT, an accusation denied by the CIA. As soon as Headley was arrested in Chicago, the Indian media had a barrage of questions for the government about him, whose <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> slow in coming.|$|E
25|$|After the report, another Guard officer came to Tripp and {{his colleagues}} with new {{information}} which did substantiate some of the allegations, and revealed to them DeZarn's role in the 1990 party. He was indicted on a perjury charge in 1996. His attorneys unsuccessfully sought to have the indictment dismissed {{on the grounds that}} his <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> literally truthful. The district court refused to do so since other witnesses had answered questions about the 1991 party with reference to the 1990 one, and that DeZarn's other answers had shown he knew which party was at issue.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} in the early 1980s of 610 undergraduate women {{asked if they had}} ever said no to sex, even though they fully intended to have sexual intercourse. The majority, 68.5% of these women answered 'no' when their intention was 'maybe'. The other 39.3% answered that when they have said 'no' really meant 'yes'. The explanations in support of their <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> that they were fearful of being considered promiscuous. Some claimed they were inhibited about sex. Others answered that they intended to manipulate the male because they were angry, wanted him to become more aroused or more aggressive.|$|E
5000|$|Link rounds: every <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> also a world capital, {{or part of}} each <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> {{an animal}} or color (inventive quiz teams {{will come up with}} more interesting, or amusing links) ...|$|R
50|$|Busemann and Petty {{showed that}} the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> {{positive}} if K is a ball. In general, the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> positive in dimensions at most 4, and negative in dimensions at least 5.|$|R
50|$|Six clips will {{be shown}} to the players, all of which pertain to pop culture. The {{question}} and the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> linked to the clip shown. Each correct <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> 30 points.|$|R
25|$|A two-to-four-word phrase was given, {{with part of}} {{the phrase}} blank, and the {{contestant}} attempted to fill-in the most common response based on a prior studio audience survey. The contestant consulted three celebrities for suggestions, and chose their favorite of those answers or one of their own. The top three <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> then revealed in ascending order. The most popular answer in the survey was worth $500, the second-most popular $250, and the third most popular $100. If a contestant failed to match {{any of the three}} answers, the bonus round ended. The idea for Family Feud (which Dawson began hosting in 1976) was derived from the Audience Match.|$|E
25|$|Literary {{analysis}} {{has been going}} on since classical Greece, when the writers of those times read previous works on the subject. No definitive <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> ever forthcoming by this method; it rather served to better define the problems. The method perhaps reached a peak in the Victorian era when new methods of systematic comparison began to be applied in philology. Typical of the era is the long and detailed study of William Ewart Gladstone, who among his many talents was a trained classicist. Until further ancient texts come to light, advances on the subject cannot be made. The most likely source of progress regarding the Pelasgians continues to be archaeology and related sciences.|$|E
25|$|In March, {{others were}} accused of witchcraft: Martha Corey, child Dorothy Good, and Rebecca Nurse in Salem Village, and Rachel Clinton in nearby Ipswich. Martha Corey had {{expressed}} skepticism about {{the credibility of the}} girls' accusations and thus drawn attention. The charges against her and Rebecca Nurse deeply troubled the community because Martha Corey was a full covenanted member of the Church in Salem Village, as was Rebecca Nurse in the Church in Salem Town. If such upstanding people could be witches, the townspeople thought, then anybody could be a witch, and church membership was no protection from accusation. Dorothy Good, the daughter of Sarah Good, was only four years old, but not exempted from questioning by the magistrates; her <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> construed as a confession that implicated her mother. In Ipswich, Rachel Clinton was arrested for witchcraft at the end of March on independent charges unrelated to the afflictions of the girls in Salem Village.|$|E
2500|$|Another common clue type is the [...] "hidden clue" [...] or [...] "container", {{where the}} <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> {{hidden in the}} text of the clue itself. For example, [...] "Made a dug-out, buried, and passed away (4)" [...] is solved by DEAD. The <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> written in the clue: [...] "maDE A Dug-out". [...] "Buried" [...] {{indicates}} that the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> embedded within the clue.|$|R
40|$|Your mission, {{should you}} choose to accept it, is to provide the common phrases or words that the {{following}} punished misdefinitions refer to. For the shorter <b>answers</b> these <b>are</b> like cryptic crossword clues. Example: body building might {{be defined as the}} morgue. The numbers tell how many letters are in each word of the answer. Where it provides a clue, single word <b>answers</b> <b>are</b> broken down into part-words: means the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> a 10 -letter word made up of elements of 6 and 4 letters. My <b>answers</b> <b>are</b> at the back of this issue, but other <b>answers</b> may <b>be</b> possible...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLet Zn=([0, 1]n×(0, 1]) ∪(∂([0, 1]n) ×{ 0 }). De Groot asked: Is cmpZn⩾n {{for every}} n? It {{is known that}} the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> yes for n= 1 and 2. V. A. Chatyrko and Y.
