40|$|There is a {{range of}} joining {{techniques}} available for use with ODS alloys, but care should be exercised in matching the technique to the final duty requirements of the joint. The goal for joining ODS alloys is a joint with no local disruption {{of the distribution of}} the oxide dispersion, and no significant change in the size and orientation of the <b>alloy</b> <b>microstructure.</b> Not surprisingly, the fusion welding processes typically employed with wrought alloys produce the least satisfactory results with ODS alloys, but some versions, such as fusion spot welding, and the laser and electron-beam welding technologies, have demonstrated potential for producing sound joints. Welds made using solid-state spot welding reportedly have exhibited parent metal properties. Thus, it is possible to employ processes that result in significant disruption of the <b>alloy</b> <b>microstructure,</b> as long as the processing parameters are adjustment to minimize the extent of or influence of the changes in the <b>alloy</b> <b>microstructure.</b> Selection among these joining approaches largely depends on the particular application and component configuration, and an understanding of the relationships among processing, <b>alloy</b> <b>microstructure,</b> and final properties is key. Recent developments have resulted in friction welding evolving to be a prime method for joining ODS sheet products, and variants of brazing/diffusion bonding have shown excellent promise for use with tubes and pipes. The techniques that come closest to the goal defined above involve solid-state diffusion bonding and, in particular, it has been found that secondary recrystallization of joints made by pulsed plasma-assisted diffusion can produce the desired, continuous, large alloy grain structure through the joint. Such joints have exhibited creep rupture failure at > 82 % of the load needed to fail the monolithic parent alloy at 1000 C...|$|E
