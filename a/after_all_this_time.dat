5|$|Shooting on Edge of Darkness {{began on}} 9 July 1984 {{and ran for}} five months until 5 December 1984. Location filming took place in London (including the Barbican Arts Centre, BBC Television Centre and the Hilton International Kensington), Yorkshire (including the {{headquarters}} of the West Yorkshire Police in Bradford, the Middleton Railway, the headquarters of Systime Computers (now the O2 building) in Leeds where Craven hacks into the MI5 computer and at Westwood Cottage, Ilkley for Craven's home), Scotland (including the Gleneagles Hotel, where Jedburgh addresses the NATO conference and also where President Reagan's Reykjavík policy was formulated) and Wales (including Clogau Gold Mine and Manod, Blaenau Ffestiniog doubling as Northmoor with the hot cell a set constructed at a factory in Penygroes). Throughout the entire shoot, the production continued to be known as Magnox; the title Dark Forces was briefly considered before the serial was renamed Edge of Darkness in April 1985. As the shoot progressed it became apparent to the cast and crew that they had a potential hit on their hands; Bob Peck recalled, “I think we knew when we were making it {{that it was a good}} piece of work” while Kennedy Martin told reporters “I haven't had this feeling about something for 20 years. It's wonderful, <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> to get something that actually works”.|$|E

500|$|Eric Renner Brown of Entertainment Weekly {{praised the}} album's variety and scale: [...] "By nature, Radiohead albums {{will always be}} {{somewhat}} epic, {{but this one is}} more consistently grandiose than any of the band's releases since 2000's masterpiece Kid A." [...] Jon Pareles, writing for the New York Times, wrote that A Moon Shaped Pool was perhaps [...] " [...] darkest statement – though the one with the band's most pastoral surface." [...] He praised Yorke's vocals and Greenwood's string arrangements, writing: [...] "Both Mr. Yorke and Mr. Greenwood are relentlessly inquisitive listeners, lovers of melody and explorers of idioms, makers of puzzles who don't shy away from emotion." [...] Chris Barton of the Los Angeles Times described A Moon Shaped Pool as [...] "a rich and engrossing listen that somehow finds more undiscovered territory for a band that has built a career on doing just that." [...] MTV's Simon Vozick-Levinson wrote: [...] "A Moon Shaped Pool provides a thrilling answer to the existential concerns that confront any band that's made it this far ... <b>After</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> hearing these five old friends challenge themselves into a new phase of evolution can still blow even a jaded fan's mind." ...|$|E

500|$|Robyn Brothers {{felt the}} line [...] "I'd break {{bread and wine}} / If there was a church I could receive in" [...] {{referenced}} feelings of spiritual alienation. She compared the song to [...] "Zooropa", stating that both reference a response to uncertainty and an unavoidable feeling of alienation. Writing for Uncut, Gavin Martin wondered if the lyric [...] "What {{are we going to}} do now it's all been said / No new ideas in the house, and every book has been read" [...] was an examination of the band's longevity, stating [...] "Bono sounded fragile, wounded, seeming even to ponder the band's usefulness." [...] He noted that it contained references to both Holy Communion and oral sex, and compared it to [...] "The Fly", noting that both songs were [...] "delivered in an amoral voice" [...] and helped to deconstruct the prevailing image of the band. Artist Gavin Friday, a childhood friend of Bono, thought the chorus line [...] "Don't let the bastards grind you down" [...] was a retaliation to the criticism of the press. Elizabeth Wurtzel of The New Yorker felt the line gave the song a political, martyr-complex. She noted that it eventually [...] "unfurls as a song about love facing the long run. It comes as a relief to discover, <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> that the guys in U2 are as hormonally charged and concerned with love as the rest of us." ...|$|E
500|$|After Mal and Peter Asher (A head of Apple Records) saw {{the rock}} band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal {{constantly}} {{suggested that the}} Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ... I thought I was different from other people in my relationship with The Beatles and being loved by them and treated so nice, I felt {{like one of the}} family. Seems I fetch and carry. I find it difficult to live on the £38 I take home each week and would love to be like their other friends who buy fantastic homes and have all the alterations done by them, and are still going to ask for a rise. I always tell myself—look, everybody wants to take from, be satisfied, try to give and you will receive. <b>After</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> I have about £70 to my name, but was content and happy. Loving them as I do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. Feel a bit better now—EGO?" [...] Evans' financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: [...] "April 24: [...] "Had to tell George —'I'm broke'. Really miserable and down because I'm in the red, and the bills are coming in, poor old Lil [...] suffers as I don't want to get a rise. Not really true don't want to ask for a rise, fellows are having a pretty tough time as it is." ...|$|E

5000|$|The righteousness of God may {{refer to}} his holiness, to his justice, or to his saving activity. A notable {{occurrence}} of the word is in [...] - [...] "for in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed" [...] (NIV). Martin Luther grew up believing that this referred to an attribute of God - namely, his distributive justice. Luther's change of mind and subsequent interpretation of the phrase as referring to the righteousness which God imputes to the believer was {{a major factor in}} the Protestant Reformation. More recently, however, scholars such as N. T. Wright have argued that the verse refers to an attribute of God <b>after</b> <b>all</b> - <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> his covenant faithfulness.|$|R

2500|$|Owing to the {{box office}} success and {{continued}} popularity of The Sound of Music (1965), Plummer remains widely known for his portrayal of Captain Von Trapp, a role he later described as [...] "so awful and sentimental and gooey". He found all aspects of making the film, except working with Andrews, unpleasant and avoids using its name, instead calling it [...] "that movie", [...] "S", or [...] "The Sound of Mucus". He declined to attend the 40th Anniversary cast reunion, but did provide commentary on the 2005 DVD release. Plummer relented in 2010 for the 45th anniversary, and appeared with the full cast on The Oprah Winfrey Show on October 28, 2010.

2500|$|In the 1966 World Cup, West Germany {{reached the}} final after beating the USSR in the semifinal, facing hosts England at Wembley Stadium.

The first extra time goal by Geoff Hurst, nicknamed [...] (Wembley goal) in Germany, is still controversial <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> As the Swiss referee did not see the situation properly, the opinion of the Soviet linesman Tofik Bakhramov who believed that the ball bounced back from the net rather than the crossbar led {{to one of the most}} contentious goals in the history of football. While the Germans pushed hard to tie the game, spectators entered the field in the final seconds, and Hurst scored another controversial goal giving England a 4–2 win.|$|E

2500|$|Siberian peasants {{more than}} those in European Russia relied on their own force and abilities. They had {{to fight against the}} harder climate without outside help. Lack of serfdom and landlords also contributed to their {{independent}} character. Unlike peasants in European Russia, Siberians had no problems with land availability; the low population density gave them the ability to intensively cultivate a plot for several years in a row, then to leave it fallow {{for a long time and}} cultivate other plots. Siberian peasants had an abundance of food, while Central Russian peasantry had to moderate their families' appetites. Leonid Blummer noted that the culture of alcohol consumption differed significantly; Siberian peasants drank frequently but moderately: [...] "For a Siberian vodka isn't a wonder, unlike for a Russian peasant, which, having reached it <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> is ready to drink a sea."

[...] Andrea Devaro of Long Island Press concluded, [...] "its simplicity beautifully portrays the complexity of emotions invoked in the song." [...] Leah Collins of Dose called Adele [...] "'60s bombshell glam" [...] {{and said that the}} video's [...] "simplicity is its strength." [...] She added: [...] "There's something about streetlamps, cafes and the River Seine that lend an air of melancholic elegance to what would otherwise be just another walk of shame by a girl with two-day-old hair. Not everyone gets to indulge in moments as tragic but beautiful as a weepy solitary walk through Paris landmarks. But then, we don't all have voices as tragic and beautiful as Adele's either." [...] A more mixed review was given by AOLs Ashley Percival who called the video predictable and added [...] "It's all very pleasant, but <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> what's the point?". Nicole Eggenberger [...] of OK! wrote that Adele [...] "created the perfect music video to go along with her hauntingly beautiful ballad" [...] and further described it as [...] "simple yet stunning." ...|$|E
