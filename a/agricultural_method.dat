25|$|Agriculture is the {{cultivation}} and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants {{and other products}} used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development {{in the rise of}} sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant <b>agricultural</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{laws that}} deal with straying cattle provide the {{earliest}} documentary evidence for an open-field farming system. They show that open-field agriculture was practiced in Wessex in Ine's time, and {{it is probable that}} this was also the prevalent <b>agricultural</b> <b>method</b> throughout the English midlands, and as far north and east as Lindsey and Deira. Not all of Wessex used this system, however: it was not used in Devon, for example. [...] The law which mentions a [...] "yard" [...] of land is the first documented mention of that unit. A yard was a unit of land equal to a quarter of a hide; a hide was variable from place to place but could be as much as [...] The yard in this sense later became the standard holding of the medieval villein, and was known as the virgate. [...] One historian has commented that [...] "the beginnings of a manorial economy are clearly visible in Ine's laws." ...|$|E

He says the play will begin at [...] "ventitré ore", an <b>agricultural</b> <b>method</b> of time-keeping that means the play will begin an hour before sunset. As Nedda steps down from the cart, Tonio offers his hand, but Canio pushes him aside and helps her down himself. The villagers suggest drinking at the tavern. Canio and Beppe accept, but Tonio stays behind. The villagers tease Canio that Tonio is planning an affair with Nedda. Canio warns everyone that while he may act the foolish husband in the play, in real life he will not tolerate other men making advances to Nedda. Shocked, a villager asks if Canio really suspects her. He says no, and sweetly kisses her on the forehead. As the church bells ring vespers, he and Beppe leave for the tavern, leaving Nedda alone.|$|E

60|$|Directly {{below the}} bluff {{on which the}} house stood were Stephen Petter's grassy meadows and his fields of grain and corn, and in the rich pastures, or {{in the shade of}} the trees {{standing}} by the bank of the rapid little stream that ran down from the woodlands, might be seen his flocks and his herds. By nature he was a very good farmer, and his <b>agricultural</b> <b>method</b> he had not derived from his books. There were people who said--and among these Calthea Rose expressed herself rather better than the others--that Mr. Petter's farm kept him, while he kept the Squirrel Inn.|$|E
60|$|Man who is ceasing {{to be an}} {{agricultural}} animal {{becomes more and more}} a builder, a traveller, and a maker. How much he ceases to be a cultivator of the soil the returns of the Redistribution Committee showed. Every year the work of our scientific laboratories increases the productivity and simplifies the labour of those who work upon the soil, and the food now of the whole world is produced by less than one per cent. of its population, a percentage which still tends to decrease. Far fewer people are needed upon the land than training and proclivity dispose towards it, and as a consequence of this excess of human attention, the garden side of life, the creation of groves and lawns and vast regions of beautiful flowers, has expanded enormously and continues to expand. For, as <b>agricultural</b> <b>method</b> intensifies and the quota is raised, one farm association after another, availing itself of the 1975 regulations, elects to produce a public garden and pleasaunce in the place of its former fields, and the area of freedom and beauty is increased. And the chemists' triumphs of synthesis, which could now give us an entirely artificial food, remain largely in abeyance because it is so much more pleasant and interesting to eat natural produce and to grow such things upon the soil. Each year adds to the variety of our fruits and the delightfulness of our flowers.|$|E

Modern archaeologists now comprehend the sophisticated intensive and productive agricultural techniques of the ancient Maya, {{and several of the}} Maya <b>agricultural</b> <b>methods</b> have not yet been reproduced. Intensive <b>agricultural</b> <b>methods</b> were developed and utilized by all the Mesoamerican cultures to boost their food production and give them a competitive advantage over less skillful peoples. These intensive <b>agricultural</b> <b>methods</b> included canals, terracing, raised fields, ridged fields, chinampas, the use of human feces as fertilizer, seasonal swamps or bajos, using muck from the bajos to create fertile fields, dikes, dams, irrigation, water reservoirs, several types of water storage systems, hydraulic systems, swamp reclamation, swidden systems, and other agricultural techniques that have not yet been fully understood.

5000|$|The {{domestic}} economy largely focused on agriculture and crafts for local consumption.

However, with the expansion of the kingdom agricultural plantations began to be a common <b>agricultural</b> <b>method</b> in the kingdom.

Major products of Mahmuei are saffron (Za`ferân) and barberry (Zereshk) that are cultivated for exporting. Beet and wheat are cultivated as well. Grapes, black plume, apricots, melons, watermelons, almonds and pistachios are produced for local use. Before 1950, opium was also cultivated. Prior to digging the first deep well about 1980s, dry farming was the only <b>agricultural</b> <b>method.</b> Today, in addition to a string of underground aqueducts (Qanât), there are two networks of piped water and 23 electric and diesel deep wells for field irrigation.|$|E
5000|$|Broadcasting is the {{distribution}} of audio or video content or other messages to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model. [...] Broadcasting began with AM radio, which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers. Before this, all forms of electronic communication (early radio, telephone, and telegraph) were one-to-one, with the message intended for a single recipient. The term broadcasting, borrowed from the <b>agricultural</b> <b>method</b> of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about, was coined by either KDKA manager Frank Conrad or RCA historian George Clark around 1920 to distinguish this new activity of [...] "one-to-many" [...] communication; a single radio station transmitting to multiple listeners.|$|E
