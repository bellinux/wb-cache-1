Since Jiang was a young girl, her father taught her to appreciate famous books, paintings, and songs. When she was 5 years old, she dreamt about being a gymnast, so her mother sent her to study dance and gymnastics. However, since her stature did not fit the standards of a gymnast, the coach of the Bengbu city gymnastics team refused to regard her as a formal team member. Afterwards, she spent five years practicing as an informal member. At the age of 17, she took the college entrance examination with the goal of going to normal university. However, she was instead accepted by a water conservation secondary school because her score was five points below the <b>acceptance</b> <b>line</b> for a normal university. In 1986, she graduated from the secondary school and started to work at the Bengbu City Water Company. Her job was to design ways of water transportation for residents. Nevertheless, she was not satisfied with her life at the time and decided to go to Beijing in 1988 to start her new life.|$|E

However, {{little is known about}} the correlation between different assays to measure global methylation and whether the source of DNA matters when examining methylation profiles in different blood cell types. Using information from 620 women, 217 and 403 women with DNA available from granulocytes (Gran) and total white blood cells (WBC), respectively, and 48 women with DNA available from four different sources [WBC, Gran, mononuclear (MN) and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) ], we compared DNA methylation for three repetitive elements (LINE 1, Sat 2, Alu) by MethyLight, luminometric methylation assay (LUMA) and [3 H]-methyl acceptance assay. For four of the five assays, DNA methylation levels measured in Gran were not correlated with methylation in LCL, MN or WBC; the exception was Sat 2. DNA methylation in LCL was correlated with methylation in MN and WBC for the [3 H]-methyl <b>acceptance,</b> <b>LINE</b> 1 and Alu assays. Methylation in MN was correlated with methylation in WBC for the [3 H]-methyl acceptance and LUMA assays. When we compared the five assays to each other by source of DNA, we observed statistically significant correlations ranging from 0. 3 – 0. 7 for each cell type with one exception (Sat 2 and Alu in MN). Among the 620 women stratified by DNA source, correlations among assays were highest for the three repetitive elements (range 0. 39 – 0. 64). Results from the LUMA assay were modestly correlated with LINE 1 (0. 18 – 0. 20). These results suggest that both assay and source of DNA are critical components in the interpretation of global DNA methylation patterns from WBC...|$|E

40|$|Successful host shifts by herbivorous insects {{may require}} the modiÞcation of {{multiple}} larval and adult traits. The seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) rarely attacks lentil (Lens culinarisMedikus), which is distantly {{related to its}} typical hosts. In a previous study, larval survival in lentil seeds increased from 2 to 85 % in fewer than 20 generations of laboratory selection. However, lentil is also a poor oviposition host; lifetime fecundity on lentil was initially {{less than a third}} of that on the ancestral host [mung bean, Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek] and one fourth of females did not even recognize lentil as a potential host. This study examined the genetic lability of host acceptance. We performed both quasi-natural selection, in which replicate lines switched to lentil were compared with those remaining on mung bean, and artiÞcial selection, in which lines were established using females from the base population that exhibited especially low or high acceptance of lentil during a short-term assay. After only Þve to eight generations of quasi-natural selection, lifetime fecundity on lentil was 2 to 3 times higher in the lentil lines than in the mung bean lines. Lentil-line females also accepted the novel host sooner after adult emergence. Similarly, a single generation of artiÞcial selection was sufÞcient to increase oviposition on lentil in the <b>acceptance</b> <b>line.</b> Host acceptance was not genetically correlated with larval survival, which remained 2 % in lines artiÞcially selected for either high or low acceptance of lentil seeds.

40|$|AbstractWhile {{the share}} of {{renewables}} has been growing rapidly since the 1990 s, at present electricity generation in Germany is still based on coal and nuclear energy, with nuclear power and lignite covering almost the whole base load electricity generation, and hard coal serving as the main energy carrier for medium-load generation. However, both coal and nuclear energy are facing major challenges. The future of coal in Germany is uncertain {{against the background of}} strong climate policy regulations and issues of public <b>acceptance.</b> In <b>line</b> with current legislation, nuclear power is being phased out. In its strategy for CO 2 emissions reduction, the German government has identified the carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies as one of the options. Major government papers highlight the importance of further research and development (R&D) in the field of CCS technologies. German industry supports R&D activities on CCS by participating in the work of public–private partnerships (PPP), e. g. the COORETEC initiative, the GEOTECHNOLOGIEN programme, as well as by implementing CCS demonstration projects. In view of the difficulties coal has been facing with regard to public acceptance in Germany, the public acceptance of CCS technologies is recognised as an important precondition for their large-scale deployment. Thus, research on public acceptance of CCS is one of the priorities accompanying R&D on these technologies. Besides the strategy of fostering national R&D activities on CCS, Germany is actively participating in international networks and organisations dealing with the CCS issues...|$|R

Automatically assigning the right solution providers to the maintenance task at hand is arguably as important as providing the right tool support for it, especially in the far too commonly found state of inadequate or obsolete documentation of large-scale software systems. Two maintenance tasks related to assignment and assistance to software developers and reviewers are addressed, and solutions are proposed. The key insight behind these proposed solutions is the analysis and use of micro-levels of human-to-code and human-to-human interactions (eg., code review). We analyzed code reviews that are managed by Gerrit and found different markers of developer expertise associated with the source code changes and their <b>acceptance,</b> time <b>line,</b> and human roles and feedback involved in the reviews. We formed a developer-expertise model from these markers and showed its application in bug triaging.

40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} is {{a serious}} problem around the world, especially in developing countries. The production of iron-biofortified rice will help ameliorate this problem. Previously, expression of the iron storage protein, ferritin, in rice using an endosperm-specific promoter resulted in a two-fold increase in iron concentration in the resultant transgenic seeds. However, further overexpression of ferritin did not produce an additional increase in the seed iron concentration, and symptoms of iron deficiency were noted in the leaves of the transgenic plants. In the present study, we aimed to further increase the iron concentration in rice seeds without increasing the sensitivity to iron deficiency by enhancing the uptake and transport of iron via a ferric iron chelator, mugineic acid. To this end, we introduced the soybean ferritin gene (SoyferH 2) driven by two endosperm-specific promoters, along with the barley nicotianamine synthase gene (HvNAS 1), two nicotianamine aminotransferase genes (HvNAAT-A and -B), and a mugineic acid synthase gene (IDS 3) to enhance mugineic acid production in rice plants. A marker-free vector was utilized as a means of increasing public <b>acceptance.</b> Representative <b>lines</b> were selected from 102 transformants based on the iron concentration in polished seeds and ferritin accumulation in the seeds. These lines were grown in both commercially supplied soil (iron-sufficient conditions) and calcareous soil (iron-deficient conditions). Lines expressing both ferritin and mugineic acid biosynthetic genes showed signs of iron-deficiency tolerance in calcareous soil. The iron concentration in polished T 3 seeds was increased by 4 and 2. 5 times, as compared to that in non-transgenic lines grown in normal and calcareous soil, respectively. These results indicate that the concomitant introduction of the ferritin gene and mugineic acid biosynthetic genes effectively increased the seed iron level without causing iron sensitivity under iron-limited conditions...|$|R

Recent {{studies suggest that the}} visual impact of transmission lines is one of the industry’s most pressing concerns and that “more visually acceptable pole designs ” is the number one technical improvement that could ease the siting of new lines. 1 For decades, utilities have sought to answer the following questions: Would more visually appealing transmission structures improve public <b>acceptance</b> of new <b>lines?</b> What measure of acceptance would justify the cost and effort?

25|$|Against the new calendar, the {{argument}} is made that inasmuch {{as the use of}} the Julian calendar was implicit in the decision of the First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea (325), no authority less than an Ecumenical Council may change this decision. However, the fact is that that Council made no decision or decree at all concerning the Julian calendar. Its silence constituted an implicit acceptance not of the Julian calendar, but of the civil calendar, which happened to be, at that time, the Julian calendar (the explicit decision of Nicaea being concerned, rather, with the date of Easter). By virtue of this, defenders of the new calendar argue that no decision by an Ecumenical Council was or is necessary today in order to revise (not abandon) the Julian calendar; and further, that by making the revision, the Church stays with the spirit of Nicaea I by keeping with the civil calendar in all its essentials—while conversely, failure to keep with the civil calendar could be seen as a departure from the spirit of Nicaea I in this respect. Lastly, it is argued that since the adoption of the new calendar evidently involves no change in or departure from the theological or the ethical teachings of Orthodox Christianity, but rather amounts to a merely disciplinary or administrative change—a clock correction of sorts—the authority to enact that change falls within the competency of contemporary, local episcopal authority. Implicit <b>acceptance</b> of this <b>line</b> of reasoning, or something very close to it, underlies the decision to adopt the new calendar by those Orthodox churches which have done so.|$|R

However the Manufacturing and Quality control of these devices has not kept pace with the advances in design technology. Instead the industry relies on eighty year old, end of <b>line,</b> <b>acceptance</b> sampling methods, due in part to destructive nature of some of the tests but mostly due to hesitancy in embracing new technological concepts. The regulatory bodies have acknowledged this hesitancy and are encouraging the use of Process analytical technology (PAT) concepts to understand and control process variation at source. Two strands of research were required to meet this challenge. The first is to develop real time non destructive assessment methods and the second requirement is to develop an approach for the statistical assessment of the overall process in real time. This thesis investigates the application of this technology on two critical to quality attributes of a combinational medical device, which currently apply end of <b>line</b> destructive <b>acceptance</b> sampling for batch release.

Drug content was assessed by developing a transferable Raman Spectroscopy Technique which quantified the coating components non‐destructively. Extensive designed experiment was deployed to establish the critical factors affecting variation and to create populations of product at extreme conditions. Prototypes for both methods developed and demonstrated successfully on site to the senior management team in Abbott Vascular.

40|$|The ongoing {{liberalization}} process {{around the}} world {{has led to the}} emergence of energy markets, facilitating more international trade between countries making the best use of energy resources and optimizing overall power systems. Consequently, inter-area power exchanges have significantly increased and further growth can be foreseen. In Europe, the planning of large energy infrastructures has entered a new dimension, namely the trans-European one. The way of thinking is gradually switching from national to regional (European) interests, as this is {{the most efficient way to}} attain a sustainable energy future. This brings many new challenges. Europe finds itself at the beginning of a transition towards a low carbon and sustainable electricity supply system, which is guided by the European Union (EU) Energy Policy core objectives: competitiveness, reliability and sustainability. This thesis looks at transmission expansion planning approaches under increased uncertainties. The liberalization of the electricity sector, the emergence of international electricity markets and increased penetration of renewable energy sources introduce many new challenges to transmission system operators. This is mainly because the complexity and related uncertainties in the power system have very much increased. These uncertainties are around the transmission scheduling and operation, and are especially related to the future needs for transmission capacity. Consequently, more advanced and robust methods for planning the transmission grid are needed. In addition, the building of new transmission lines is usually a lengthy process because of the authorization process duration. This process needs to become shorter in order to match the fast pace of changes in generation capacity and location. The main contributions of this thesis are: a new (round-the-year) method and new criteria for assessing the bottlenecks in the grid; a security-based iterative method for proposing network reinforcements; investigating the potential development of a transnational offshore grid in the North Sea and its effects on the onshore system; proposing an approach for streamlining approval procedures of transmission lines and fostering societal <b>acceptance</b> of transmission <b>lines.</b> Intelligent Electrical Power GridElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{visible light}} {{diagnostic}} beam line at SPEAR 3 utilizes dipole radiation extracted through an ID exit port to evaluate electron beam properties {{at a variety}} of diagnostic end-stations. The unfocused SR light is collected 17 m from the source point by a 150 mm diameter, f= 2 m lens and optically relayed to the appropriate station. For transverse imaging, an image-intensified PiMax camera with 2 ns gate allows measurement of fast beam dynamics for either the stored beam or the injected beam. For these applications the visible light is switched into either a standard symmetric-lens transport line or a beam-shaping transport line equipped with cylindrical lenses and a rotating mirror to sweep the beam image across the camera photocathode. A separate two slit stellar-interferometer branch line can resolve the diffraction-limited vertical beam height down to about 10 m. For longitudinal charge profile measurements, the light is switched to a Hamamatsu C 5680 streak camera with net system resolution of ~ 2. 5 ps rms. In this paper we outline the main photon beam transport line, review the SR beam properties and describe measurement capabilities at each diagnostic station. TRANSPORT LINE AND PHOTON BEAM PROPERTIES The SPEAR 3 light source features a 10 nm-rad emittance electron beam with up to 500 mA circulating current. The visible light diagnostic beam line takes dipole radiation ~ 10 mrad into a standard, 1. 27 T dipole magnet where the source point dimensions are 150 x 20 m and the critical photon energy is 7. 6 keV. At 500 mA the total radiated power into the 3. 5 x 6 mrad beam <b>line</b> <b>acceptance</b> is 245 W. To reduce beam power on the first Rh-coated Si mirror (M 0), the x-ray component is intercepted by a ± 0. 47 mrad GlidCop „cold finger ‟ extending horizontally across the core of the beam. Hence, as illustrated in Figure 1, both the upper and lower portions of the beam are accessible for observation. This configuration yields the maximum photon flux and the opportunity for transverse beam coherence measurements. The remaining 5 W beam power past the cold finger strike...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Engineering of Loughborough University. For over a decade UK legislation has existed which grants powers to English Local Authorities to implement a Workplace Parking Levy (WPL). Despite positive experiences in Australia of utilising area wide parking space levies to pay for public transport improvements, only one UK local authority to date (2017), Nottingham City Council, has chosen to implement a WPL. The Nottingham WPL scheme is intended {{to act as a}} transport demand management measure as well as a core funding mechanism for transport improvements including two new tram <b>lines.</b> <b>Acceptance</b> by the public and the business community is a key barrier to implementing a WPL. The two major criticisms of the Nottingham scheme prior to its implementation were that a WPL would discourage business investment and thus damage the economy while its intended impact on traffic congestion would be minimal. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of the Nottingham WPL scheme s performance is essential in order to facilitate transferability of this approach to other UK and European Cities. This thesis contributes to the wider WPL evaluation project by evaluating to what extent the Nottingham WPL has met three key objectives identified for the scheme which address the impact on congestion, transport mode share and inward investment. This research utilises a theoretical evaluation approach, a Theory of Change approach strengthened by elements of Realistic Evaluation. This approach provides an appropriate framework for evaluating progress towards the three key objectives by identifying a plausible model for change and expected impacts for the Nottingham WPL and the transport improvements which it part funds. This model or Theory of Change, is then tested to understand if the scheme is achieving the desired impacts by analysing appropriate indicators to measure and attribute change to causal factors. Methods used to facilitate this research include, benchmarking indicators against similar UK Cities, questionnaire surveys to assess the reasons for mode switch, time series modelling of the impact on congestion and a consideration of the reasoning behind investment and de-investment decisions made by businesses in Nottingham. It is concluded that while the WPL and its associated transport improvements are resulting in congestion constraint and mode shift away from commuting by car, these impacts are being reduced by the presence of exogenous change notably, economic and population growth, short term disruption to the road network resulting from roadworks associated with the construction of transport improvements and suppressed demand for commuting by car. Additionally, this research shows that there is a body of evidence which demonstrates that the WPL has not negatively impacted on levels of inward investment and that there is some evidence to date that suggests the improved transport system facilitated by the WPL is attractive to potential business investors...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} open {{innovation}} has gained widespread <b>acceptance</b> in different <b>lines</b> of research, {{and it has}} had {{a major impact on}} both research and practice during the last decade. The inherent logic of open innovation is simply that firms can and should use external as well as internal knowledge and information sources, and both internal and external paths to market, when they seek to maximize returns from development activities. While the mainstream literature has mainly reported on open innovation during product development, this thesis highlights the importance of open innovation activities during process development. Indeed, strong collaboration and significant joint development activities are typically required between buyers and suppliers when developing and implementing new process technologies. This is especially true in the process industries where process development is a key source of competitiveness. However, joint process development projects in this setting are often plagued by severe budget overruns, time delays, and quality problems. Developing and implementing new process technology is thus a risky endeavor that may seriously endanger long-term competitive advantages and the financial viability of firms if not managed proficiently. In particular, these projects are often complex to manage, as interdependencies among a number of actors, activities, and the overall process design create problems and information gaps for both buyers and suppliers. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} increased knowledge to facilitate improved collaboration so as to decrease the risk of project failure. Accordingly, the purpose of this thesis is to increase the understanding of how process firms and equipment suppliers can improve the management of joint development projects. Empirically, the results are based on three case studies and a comprehensive project-level survey within the process industries. The thesis is based on empirical data from 84 interviews with employees of two process firms and nine equipment suppliers as well as 251 survey respondents from 52 joint development projects. These numbers include respondents from eight European countries. The results can be summarized in a number of points. First, firms should revise their development processes to manage interorganizational collaboration. Second, different problems and collaborative activities must be managed as the project progresses from development to implementation. To this end, different stages require different participants and different modes of communication and coordination among participants. Thus, the content and the intensity of the collaboration should be tailored to the information processing needs in different stages of the equipment’s lifecycle. To support an appropriate collaboration process, firms should tailor their procurement procedures to the characteristics of the project. These findings present a number of implications for managers and practitioners alike in light of the increasing importance of interorganizational collaboration and process development.
