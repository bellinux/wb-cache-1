40|$|Das Gesundheitssystem in Deutschland ist in den letzten dreißig Jahren nicht nur Gegenstand zahlreicher Reformversuche gewesen, es sind nunmehr tatsächlich nachhaltige Veränderungen im Steuerungssystem festzustellen. Der einstmals große Einfluss der relativ autonomen gemeinsamen Selbstverwaltung ist gesunken. Durch Gesundheitsreformen intervenierte der Staat in den Regelungsbereich der Selbstverwaltung, begrenzte den Entscheidungsspielraum korporatistischer Verhandlungssysteme und implementierte ökonomische Anreize, welche das Verhalten der Leistungserbringer und Finanzierungsträger beeinflussen sollen. Die Bilanz dieser Strukturreformen für die staatliche Steuerungsfähigkeit fällt positiv aus. Reformblockaden, wie sie die Politikwissenschaft im korporatistischen System des ambulanten Sektors feststellte, wurden teilweise durchbrochen. Einerseits verbesserte der neue Steuerungsmix die Durchsetzungsfähigkeit des Staates gegenüber den korporatistischen Akteuren, andererseits scheinen die Reformen die Handlungsfähigkeit korporatistischer Institutionen zu gefährden. Im Zuge der Implementation von Wettbewerbselementen ist insbesondere das Kollektivvertragssystem politisch bedroht. Angesichts der Reformdynamik plädiert die vorliegende Arbeit für eine planvolle Modifikation korporatistischer Institutionen. Wettbewerb und ökonomische Anreize lassen erwarten, dass zur Gewährleistung der versorgungspolitischen Performanz staatliche Regulierung eher noch ausgebaut werden muss. Die Steuerungspotenziale korporatistischer Institutionen sollten erhalten bleiben, um diese staatlichen Maßnahmen zu unterstützen.

The once great influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relatively autonomous common self-government has decreased. Through health care reforms, the state intervened in <b>the</b> regulation area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self-government, limited the deciding match space of corporatist bargaining systems, and implemented economic incentives in order to influence <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> providers and purchasers.

A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. <b>The</b> study <b>of</b> faith-based giving, {{development}} and engagement with human catastrophe is only beginni ng {{to be identified}} and resear ched by social scientists and other disciplines. Almost all faiths in the world im press upon their adherents to serve and engage in humanitarian aid causes. Some faiths prescribe and proscribe through divine teachings on how adheren ts should go about participating in humanitarian aid causes and set certai n constraints and parameters for its fulfilment as a religious act and duty. Islam is one such religion that requires its adherents to conform to religious <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> giving through <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> charity which makes up <b>the</b> third article <b>of</b> faith. Muslims <b>the</b> world over are required to give {{a portion of their}} surplus income by way of prescribed and optional charities to humanitarian aid causes both within a nd outside of their community. This prescription is incumbent on all Muslims irre spective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> society that they live in as long as they profess faith. The Muslim community in South Africa comprises a minority group with diverse socio-historical backgrounds and its demographic position is no different to <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country’s population. It is characterised by Muslims who had slave, indentured, migrant and trading histories who have now made a permanent presence in <b>the</b> southern tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> African continent. Its social organisation has evolved over time and currently as a mino rity group it has entrenched itself in all facets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South African way of life, networking with other diasporic communities and nation states worldwide. It has a well-developed philanthropic infrastructure and is known to have undertaken humanitarian aid causes both within and outside of its community. In post-apartheid South Africa, the Sout h African Muslim community, given the country’s reintegration in the global system after years of political isolation, has played an indelible role in supporting humanitarian aid causes in disaster affected areas. It is in this context that this study examines <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> a Muslim faith-based organisation’s engagement in benevolent disaster related humanitarian aid causes in South Africa. Given <b>the</b> diverse number <b>of</b> faith-bas ed humanitarian organisations amongst Muslims in South Africa, the study undertakes an extensive case study of one faith-based organisation which has a track record in providing such service. The study is preceded by an extensive literature study with a view to formulating a conceptual framework upon which later analysis is undertaken together with the empirical data. It draws on key sociological concepts in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> philanthropy in order to provide a scientific context to the study. An in-depth analysis is made of religious texts and writings which prov ide the context around which faith-based organisations fulfil their humanitarian aid objectives. <b>The</b> empirical aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study is triangulated using both qualitative and quantitat ive data derived from a select group of donors and volunteers who made up the key respondents in the study. Documentary and conflict analysis were under taken to construct a profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case taking into consideration <b>the</b> different aspects <b>of</b> its social organisation. The study concludes with <b>the</b> presentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research in keeping with its main assumptions and concludes with practical recommendations and how to better align with faith-based organisations engaged in international disaster relief missions with a view to be more effective and pursue sustainable ways of engagement in disaster afflicted areas...|$|R
