5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle was {{constructed}} by Thomas, the Earl of Lancaster, between 1313 and 1322. Thomas was <b>an</b> <b>immensely</b> powerful English baron, the second {{richest man in}} England after the King, with major land holdings across the kingdom. He had a turbulent relationship with his cousin, King Edward II, and had been a ringleader in the capture and killing of Edward's royal favourite, Piers Gaveston, in 1312.|$|E

He finds Najid alone {{in the city and}} soon develops a paternal relationship with the boy. He has a close relationship with Sarah and grows despondent when she dies from a mutated strain of the virus {{near the end of the}} second series. He volunteers for the experimental vaccine and survives.|$|E
5|$|After his {{election}} to parliament in 1934, Davies was a consistent {{advocate for the}} interests of Merthyr Tydfil and the Welsh mining community. Largely indifferent to party discipline, he defied official Labour policy by championing such causes as disarmament and Welsh nationalism. His persistence in doing so brought him several suspensions from the party, and he was never offered ministerial office. <b>An</b> <b>immensely</b> popular figure locally, he was regularly returned at general elections with large majorities. In 1966, after an unstable colliery spoil tip collapsed on the village of Aberfan {{with the loss of}} 144 lives, Davies controversially stated that he had long thought that the tip was unsafe. He had not reported his suspicions, for fear that an inquiry would cause the closures of local pits. Not long after his unexpected 1970 electoral triumph, Davies died early in 1972 aged at least 85 and possibly 90 or more.|$|E

5|$|The {{marines are}} {{overwhelmed}} by the aliens. Scaling cliffs and navigating destroyed buildings, Gordon reaches safety underground. The marines pull out of Black Mesa and begin airstrikes. Gordon goes through underground water channels as aliens pick off the remaining marines. He arrives at the Lambda Complex, where scientists developed the teleportation technology that allowed travel to Xen. The remaining staff tell Gordon that the satellite failed to reverse {{the effects of the}} resonance cascade as <b>an</b> <b>immensely</b> powerful being {{on the other side of}} the rift is keeping it open. The scientists activate the teleporter to send Gordon to Xen and stop the being. In Xen, Gordon encounters the remains of researchers before him and defeats Gonarch, the huge egg-laying headcrab. At a factory creating alien soldiers, he defeats levitating creatures and enters a giant portal. In a vast cave, Gordon confronts the Nihilanth, the entity maintaining the rift, and destroys it.|$|E
5|$|O'Hara {{married her}} third husband, Charles F. Blair, Jr., 11 years her senior, on 12 March 1968. Blair, <b>an</b> <b>immensely</b> popular figure, {{was a pioneer}} of transatlantic aviation, a former brigadier general of the US Air Force, a former chief pilot at Pan Am, and founder {{and head of the}} U.S. Virgin Islands airline Antilles Air Boats. A few years after her {{marriage}} to Blair, O'Hara, for the most part, retired from acting. In the special features section to the DVD release of The Quiet Man, a story is recounted that O'Hara retired after longtime collaborators John Wayne and John Ford teased her about being married but not being a good, stay-at-home housewife, though Blair himself wanted her to retire from acting and help run his business. Blair died in 1978 while flying a Grumman Goose for his airline from St. Croix to St. Thomas, crashing after an engine failure. O'Hara was elected CEO and president of the airline, with the added distinction of becoming the first woman president of a scheduled airline in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Real {{property}} {{law in the}} English and Welsh legal system had evolved from feudalism, and was <b>an</b> <b>immensely</b> complex system understood by {{only a small number}} of lawyers. In particular peculiarities meant that land owned by beneficiaries could be sold without the agreement of all the beneficiaries involved, something partially rectified by the Settled Land Act 1882 and the Land Transfer Act 1897. Despite these statutes reform in this area was still needed, and Lord Haldane presented reform bills to parliament in 1913, 1914 and 1915 with no real progress thanks to the opposition of the Law Society. In March 1917 a Reconstruction Subcommittee under Sir Leslie Scott was created to consider land policy after the First World War, and Schuster (who had devilled for Scott when working as a barrister in Liverpool) was appointed as a member. The subcommittee decided that the law should be changed to merge real and personal {{property law}}, and that outdated aspects of land law such as copyholds and gavelkind should be eliminated. When Birkenhead became Lord Chancellor in 1919 he inherited the problem of English property law, and immediately instructed Schuster to prepare the department for forcing a bill through Parliament on the matter.|$|E

5|$|Stromberg demanded {{complete}} authenticity in casting, language, and {{the depiction}} of Eskimo life. Casting was critical. Van Dyke cast Inupiat natives (most of them from Barrow, Alaska) for all the minor roles, but Stromberg was so insistent on finding the perfect male lead that casting the title role of Mala/Kripik proved difficult. MGM wanted Ray Wise, the actor and cameraman (who later {{changed his name to}} Ray Mala), as the star of the picture, and he would become Alaska's first movie star. Wise was a half-Inupiat, half-Russian Jew who previously starred in the 1932 documentary film Igloo. Van Dyke wanted an all-native cast, not a half-native lead, and rejected Wise. A young native Alaskan was hired for the role, but he walked off the set in July 1932 when the stress of filming proved too great. Already on location in Alaska and isolated from the studio, Van Dyke turned to Ray Wise. Not only could Wise perform his own stunts, but Stromberg praised him as <b>an</b> <b>immensely</b> realistic actor. Wise came to Hollywood in 1925, and in addition to his work on Igloo was working as an assistant cameraman. He was hired as a guide for Eskimo's production to Alaska, and was able to offer his services to the film when the original actor quit. Although the film's credits state that professional actors were used only for the Canadian police roles, in fact the major female roles were played by professional actresses Lotus Long and Lulu Wong Ying. Numerous minor roles are also clearly filled by trained actors in make-up and costume.|$|E

Nonetheless, these beverages were formerly drunk as a compliment to meat and poultry dishes, sweet porridge, and dessert. Of particular note is sbiten, <b>an</b> <b>immensely</b> popular medieval drink which has since been replaced by tea as the Russian mainstay beverage.|$|E
