40|$|Cambridge University Press (2008) 2015. Introduction Aspiration is the {{introduction}} of oropharyngeal or gastric contents into the respiratory tract. Three major syndromes may develop {{as a consequence of}} aspiration: chemical pneumonitis, bronchial obstruction secondary to aspiration of particulate matter, and bacterial aspiration pneumonia. Less commonly, interstitial lung disease occurs in persons with chronic aspiration. Which of these consequences emerges is determined by the amount and nature of the aspirated material {{as well as by the}} integrity of host defense mechanisms. The term aspiration pneumonia refers to the infectious consequences of introduction of relatively large volumes of oral material into the lower airways (macroaspiration). Although healthy persons frequently aspirate small volumes of pharyngeal secretions during sleep, the development of pneumonia after such microaspiration is normally prevented by mechanical (e. g., cough and mucociliary transport) and immunologic responses. Pneumonia arises when these host defenses are not able to limit bacterial proliferation either because of microaspiration of highly virulent pathogens to which the host lacks specific immunity (e. g., Streptococcus pneumoniae or enteric gram-negative bacteria) or because of macroaspiration of large quantities of organisms that may not necessarily be highly virulent. Aspiration may be clinically obvious, as when acute pulmonary complications follow inhalation of vomited gastric contents. Such <b>acute</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>pneumonitis,</b> representing damage to lung parenchyma by highly acidic gastric contents, is often referred to as Mendelsonâ€™s syndrome. On the other extreme, so-called silent aspiration, as occurs in persons with neurologic impairment who lack cough responses, is often followed by the indolent onset of infectious pneumonia consequent to contamination of the lower airways by low virulence mixtures of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms from the oropharynx...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} use of beryllium in {{a variety}} of industries continues to be a hazard. New cases are still being reported to the UK Beryllium Case Registry, now numbering 60 in the period 1945 - 1988. The majority of cases follow inhalation which results in <b>acute</b> beryllium disease (<b>chemical</b> <b>pneumonitis)</b> or more commonly chronic beryllium disease [...] a granulomatous pneumonitis. Granulomatous skin nodules also occur following local implantation. The clinical and radiological features are briefly described with the emphasis on pathology and immunology. Laser microprobe mass spectrometry analysis of tissue sections is a major advance in diagnosis. Detection of beryllium distinguishes the granulomas of chronic beryllium disease from other diseases, in particular sarcoidosis. The role of beryllium lymphocyte transformation tests is discussed. Chronic beryllium disease is steroid dependent and local excision of skin lesions appears to be curative. There is no evidence that beryllium is carcinogenic...|$|R
40|$|Background: Fire eater's lung (FEL) is a {{distinct}} form of <b>acute</b> <b>chemical</b> toxic <b>pneumonitis,</b> which is caused by aspiration of flammable petrochemical derivatives used by street performers for 'fire eating'. The optimal management of this condition {{has not yet been}} determined. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate patient characteristics, clinical features, treatment, and outcome of FEL. Methods: A single-center retrospective review of consecutive cases of FEL in children and adults reported to a national poison center (the Swiss Toxicological Information Center) between 1995 and 2012. Results: 123 cases (83. 7 % males, mean age 21. 9 years) were included. The most frequently reported symptom was cough (50. 4 %), followed by chest pain (45. 5 %), and fever (35. 8 %). Dyspnea was reported by 23. 6 %. Cough (p = 0. 002) and chest pain (p = 0. 02) were significantly more prevalent in subjects reporting to have aspirated the fuel compared to those who have swallowed it or who did not perceive poison exposure. A pulmonary infiltrate was detected in 83 % of the cases in whom chest X-ray was performed. Overall, 22 % were treated with an antibiotic agent for a mean duration of 10. 4 days. Corticosteroids were administered in 4. 9 %. All showed complete recovery irrespective of the therapeutic management. Conclusion: The combination of intense pleuritic chest pain, cough, dyspnea, and fever, or any of these symptoms after 'fire eating' or erroneous swallowing of a petroleum distillate should alert the clinician to the diagnosis of FEL. Early antibiotic treatment of severe cases seems justified, considering that clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings of FEL are overlapping with bacterial superinfection...|$|R

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the immune status {{in a group of}} {{children}} with <b>acute</b> <b>chemical</b> injury and to define the role of integral hematological parameters in the rapid evaluation of the functional state of the immune system. Subjects and methods. Ten patients aged 1 to 3 years with <b>acute</b> <b>chemical</b> poisoning were examined. They underwent immune status examination and clinical blood analysis with calculation of integral hematological parameters, by using the conventional formulas. Results. Within the first 24 hours of the disease, the children were found to have higher neutrophils, lower lymphocytes, and moderate monocytosis. Immunological studies revealed a reduction in total lymphocyte counts due to a decreased T-cell ratios. The level of B lymphocytes did not differ from the normal values, {{but at the same time}} there was impaired B-lymphocyte production of immunoglobulins. The absorbing capacity of neutrophils remained unchanged and oxygen-dependent cellular metabolism was enhanced. Conclusion.

40|$|During {{the last}} three years the National Poisons Control Centre (NVIC) of the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) found an {{increasing}} number of poisonings of children by lamp oil. In order to establish the circumstances of exposure, the frequency and severity of clinical effects and the treatment received, a prospective study was carried out in 1996. In close co-operation with the General Inspectorate for Health Protection (IGB) more specific information on the circumstances of exposure and the products involved was collected during the second half year of the study. Lamp oil ingestions involve a considerable risk of aspiration and <b>chemical</b> <b>pneumonitis.</b> In this study ingestion of lamp oil resulted in clinical effects in the majority of the cases. Effects most frequently seen were coughing, vomiting and dizziness. <b>Chemical</b> <b>pneumonitis</b> was reported in several cases. Physicians need to be notified that not all performed therapies were according to the NVIC guidelines and that these therapies possess risks for serious and unwanted clinical effects. Most of the children drank the lamp oil directly from the lamp. Drinking from the lamp clearly needs more attention so people may be notified by warnings on the packages.

40|$|A scientifically sound {{assessment}} of the risk to human health resulting from <b>acute</b> <b>chemical</b> releases is the cornerstone for chemical incident prevention, preparedness and response. Although the general methodology to identify <b>acute</b> toxicity of <b>chemicals</b> has not substantially {{changed in the last}} decades, there is ongoing debate on the current approaches for human health risk assessment in scenarios involving <b>acute</b> <b>chemical</b> releases. A survey was conducted to identify: (1) the most important present and potential future chemical incident scenarios and anticipated changes in chemical incidents or their management; (2) information, tools and guidance used in different countries to assess health risks from <b>acute</b> <b>chemical</b> releases; and (3) needs for new information, tools, guidance and expertise to enable the valid and rapid health risk {{assessment of}} <b>acute</b> <b>chemical</b> exposures. According to the results, there is an obvious variability in risk assessment practices within Europe. The multiplicity of acute exposure reference values appears to result in variable practices. There is a need for training especially on the practical application of acute exposure reference values. Although acutely toxic and irritating/corrosive chemicals will remain serious risks also in future the development of plausible scenarios for potential emerging risks is also needed.
