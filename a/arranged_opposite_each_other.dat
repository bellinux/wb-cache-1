40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis is to design a quantum well infrared detector with tunable spectral bandwidth. The tunability of the bandwidth is achieved by using the linear Stark effect for the ground to first excited state transition in an asymmetric quantum well. The position of the absorption peak {{is dependent on the}} direction of the electric field, and therefore it can be either blue or red shifted by changing the direction of the field. If two identical asymmetric quantum wells are <b>arranged</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> we can obtain both the blue and red shift for either direction of the bias. This method can produce broader peaks with tunable bandwidths proportional to the applied field. A program was developed to calculate the energy levels and wavefunctions of an arbitrary quantum well. The program was used to design a step quantum well capable of detecting infrared in the 8 - 12 m m band. The validity of the approach was verified by comparison with experimental data and found to have a good agreement. The designed step well was used to create a tunable bandwidth detector. The analysis showed that the bandwidth could be tuned to more than twice the peak width. The numerical simulation indicates the possibility of manufacturing a tunable bandwidth infrared detector by using step quantum wells. First Lieutenant, Turkish Arm...|$|E

The structure was determined from two different crystal forms to resolutions of 1. 75 and 2. 05 A, respectively. ClgR folds into a five-helix bundle with a helix-turn-helix motif typical for DNA-binding proteins. Upon dimerization the two DNA-recognition helices are <b>arranged</b> <b>opposite</b> to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> at the protein surface in a distance of approximately 30 A, which suggests that they bind into two adjacent major grooves of B-DNA in an anti-parallel manner.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. In this thesis a tunable bandwidth quantum well photo-detector (TB-QWIP) is fabricated and experimentally characterized. The designed detector {{is based on}} the Stark effect with two quantum step wells <b>arranged</b> <b>opposite</b> to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> to simultaneously achieve both blue- and red-shift of the absorption peak for either direction of the bias. The characterization of the TB-QWIP is based on absorption measurement with Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) spectroscopy, current versus applied voltage (I-V) measurement with a semiconductor parameter analyzer, and photocurrent spectroscopy. The measured IR absorption peaks found at room temperature 8. 8 m and 10. 0 m are in good agreement with designed values. The dark current of the test detector was found to be 10 - 9 A and a background photocurrent was found to be 700 x 10 - 9 A at - 4 V bias at 10 K. The background-limited performance of the device was found to be at 60 K. The peak responsivity of the detector was 0. 39 A/W at 8. 2 Ã¦m. The maximum normalized detectivity under background limited conditions D*BLIP, was calculated to be 3. 5 x 1011 cm Hz /W. The bandwidth of the detector tuned with bias from 1. 8 Ã¦m at - 1 V to 2. 7 Ã¦m at - 4 V, which amounts to 50 % higher than the original width. Further tuning of TB-QWIP parameters based on the analysis of this thesis hold promise for 100 % increase of peak width by an applied bias. Lieutenant Colonel, Hellenic Air Forc...|$|R
