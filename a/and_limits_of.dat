5|$|In a 1978 {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Clavaria, Ronald Petersen placed C.zollingeri in the subgenus Clavaria, a grouping of species with clamp connections absent from all septa in the fruit body; others in the subgenus included C.purpurea, C.fumosa, and the type, C.vermicularis. A large-scale molecular analysis of the phylogenetic distributions <b>and</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> clavarioid fungi in the family Clavariaceae was published by Bryn Dentiger and David McLaughlin in 2006. Based on their analysis of ribosomal DNA sequences, C.zollingeri shared the greatest genetic similarity with Clavulinopsis laeticolor. Petersen's concept of the infrageneric {{classification of}} Clavaria was largely rejected in this analysis, as {{two of the three}} subgenera he proposed were found to be polyphyletic.|$|E

He both reviewed earlier studies on motion and conducted two of his own, concluding perceiving movement {{was more than the}} sum of seeing successive sequential images. He also surveyed and reported in reviews in the Psychological Bulletin experiments at various labs, including those in Europe, on matters related to sensation and perception.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{theory of}} Islamic {{jurisprudence}} elaborates how scriptures {{should be interpreted}} {{from the standpoint of}} linguistics and rhetoric. It also comprises methods for establishing authenticity of hadith and for determining when the legal force of a scriptural passage is abrogated by a passage revealed at a later date. In addition to the Quran and sunnah, the classical theory of Sunni fiqh recognizes two other sources of law: juristic consensus (ijmaʿ) and analogical reasoning (qiyas). It therefore studies the application <b>and</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> analogy, as well as the value <b>and</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> consensus, along with other methodological principles, some of which are accepted by only certain legal schools. This interpretive apparatus is brought together under the rubric of ijtihad, which refers to a jurist's exertion in an attempt to arrive at a ruling on a particular question. The theory of Twelver Shia jurisprudence parallels that of Sunni schools with some differences, such as recognition of reason (ʿaql) as a source of law in place of qiyas and extension of the notion of sunnah to include traditions of the imams.|$|E

25|$|Author {{and pilot}} William Langewiesche {{asserted}} that insufficient credit {{was given to}} the A320's fly-by-wire design, by which the pilot uses a side-stick to make control inputs to the flight control computers. The computers then impose adjustments <b>and</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> their own to keep the plane stable, which the pilot cannot override even in an emergency. This design allowed the pilots of Flight 1549 to concentrate on engine restart and deciding the course, without the burden of manually adjusting the glidepath to reduce the plane's rate of descent. Sullenberger said that these computer-imposed limits also prevented him from achieving the optimum landing flare for the ditching, which would have softened the impact.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that a high void {{coefficient}} does not necessarily make a reactor inherently unsafe, as some of the fission neutrons are emitted with a delay of seconds or even minutes (post-fission neutron emission from daughter nuclei), so steps can be taken to reduce the fission rate before it gets too high. However, it does make it considerably harder to control the reactor (especially at low power) and makes it imperative that the control systems are very reliable and the control room personnel (regardless of rank or position) are rigorously trained in the peculiarities <b>and</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> the system. Neither of these requirements were in place at Chernobyl: since the reactor's actual design bore the approval stamp of the Kurchatov Institute and was considered a state secret, discussion of the reactor's flaws was forbidden, even among the actual personnel operating the plant. Some later RBMK designs did include control rods on electromagnetic grapples, thus controlling the reaction speed and, if necessary, stopping the reaction completely. The RBMK at Chernobyl, however, had manual control rods.|$|E
25|$|Tennessee was {{admitted}} to the Union on June 1, 1796 as the 16th state. It was the first state created from territory {{under the jurisdiction of the}} United States federal government. Apart from the former Thirteen Colonies only Vermont and Kentucky predate Tennessee's statehood, and neither was ever a federal territory. The Constitution of the State of Tennessee, Article I, Section 31, states that the beginning point for identifying the boundary is the extreme height of the Stone Mountain, at the place where the line of Virginia intersects it, and basically runs the extreme heights of mountain chains through the Appalachian Mountains separating North Carolina from Tennessee past the Indian towns of Cowee and Old Chota, thence along the main ridge of the said mountain (Unicoi Mountain) to the southern boundary of the state; all the territory, lands and waters lying west of said line are included in the boundaries <b>and</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> the newly formed state of Tennessee. Part of the provision also stated that the limits and jurisdiction of the state would include future land acquisition, referencing possible land trade with other states, or the acquisition of territory from west of the Mississippi River.|$|E

After the {{collapse}} of the Raid of Ruthven, another initiative to secure a pro-English government in Scotland, Walsingham reluctantly visited the Scottish court in August 1583, knowing that his diplomatic mission was unlikely to succeed. James VI dismissed Walsingham's advice on domestic policy saying he was an [...] "absolute King" [...] in Scotland. Walsingham replied with a discourse on the topic that [...] "young princes were many times carried into great errors upon an opinion of the absoluteness of their royal authority and do not consider, that when they transgress the bounds <b>and</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> the law, they leave to be kings and become tyrants."

500|$|The front [...] of the aircraft, {{from the}} front of the cockpit to near the front of the {{first-class}} passenger cabin, was reconstructed.

The cockpit voice recorder used a 1/4inch recording tape that operated on a 30-minute loop. It therefore only retained that half-hour of the flight before the recorders failed, six minutes before the crash. The CVR recording and transcript were covered by a strict privilege under section 28 of the Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act and thus were not publicly disclosed, although the air traffic control recordings are less strictly privileged: section 29 of the same act provides only that they may not be used in certain legal proceedings.

The character received mixed reactions from the show's cast and television critics. Jeanmarie described Vincent as representing {{the way in}} which Passions [...] "pushed the boundaries <b>and</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> what other soap operas didn't dare to do." [...] On the other hand, Tracey Ross said the storyline of Vincent giving birth to his father's child made her [...] "physically nauseous" [...] and she could only complete the delivery scenes after the show's acting coach Maria O'Brien convinced her of [...] "the comedic possibilities." [...] Jamey Giddens of Daytime Confidential felt that Jeanmarie deserved an Emmy for making Vincent's outlandish situations believable. Josh Robertson of Complex called Duplaix, who had been a Playboy Playmate, {{one of the most successful}} soap actresses for her performances as Valerie in 34 episodes of Passions, along with her portrayal of Rachel Gannon in 95 episodes of One Life to Live.

Bianco commented positively on the way Colfer's singing was used to [...] "dig beneath the archness and anger in Kurt's behavior", calling it [...] "a textbook example of what music can add to drama." [...] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald went further in his praise, deeming [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] "the perfect blend of music, characterization and plot - and easily the most provocative scripted hour in prime-time of the new season." [...] Perigard appreciated the fact there were no easy answers presented, with no characters undergoing religious conversions {{during the course of the}} episode. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal felt that [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] succeeded in balancing opposing viewpoints, resulting in [...] "a nuanced, atypical episode of Glee that was both conflictingly emotional and confidently serious about the topic of religion", and Semigran similarly commended the episode's balance, writing that Falchuk [...] "covered both sides of controversial debate with grace, humor, and most importantly, respect." [...] In an article discussing Glee increasingly inconsistent tone, characterizations, and weird moments in the second season, film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz cited [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] as an exception: [...] "an episode built around an earnest, Afterschool Special-style contemplation of faith that improbably turned out to be one of the series' boldest, silliest, maybe finest hours".|$|E
