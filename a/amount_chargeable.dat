6000|$|During {{the last}} fiscal year 23,196 names {{were added to}} the pension rolls and 4,876 dropped therefrom, leaving at its close 187,963. The amount paid to pensioners, {{including}} the compensation of disbursing agents, was $28,422,884, an increase of $4,411,902 on that of the previous year. The munificence of Congress has been conspicuously manifested in its legislation for the soldiers and sailors who suffered in the recent struggle to maintain [...] "that unity of government which makes us one people." [...] The additions to the pension rolls of each successive year since the conclusion of hostilities result in a great degree from the repeated amendments of the act of the 14th of July, 1862, which extended its provisions to cases not falling within its original scope. The large outlay which is thus occasioned is further increased by the more liberal allowance bestowed since that date upon those who {{in the line of duty}} were wholly or permanently disabled. Public opinion has given an emphatic sanction to these measures of Congress, and it will be conceded that no part of our public burden is more cheerfully borne than that which is imposed by this branch of the service. It necessitates for the next fiscal year, in addition to the <b>amount</b> justly <b>chargeable</b> to the naval pension fund, an appropriation of $30,000,000.|$|R

40|$|In {{the ever-changing}} {{telecommunications}} industry {{there appears to}} be an enormous amount of confusion not only as to the appropriate <b>amount</b> of compensation <b>chargeable</b> to the users of public rights-of-way, but also as to the very authority of state and local governments to require compensation. This was not always the case. It has long been a well-settled legal principle that local governments may receive reasonable 2 ̆ 2 rental 2 ̆ 2 compensation from private commercial entities for their use of local public property for private economic gain, even where federal statutory law restricts local governments from denying access to rights-of-way for telecommunications services. For example, in a turn-of-the-century case construing the applicability of a federal law to a telegraph company 2 ̆ 7 s use of local public property, the Kentucky Court of Appeals, citing several previous United States Supreme Court cases, stated: The Congress of the United States has no power to take private property for public purposes without compensation, and it can no more take the property of a state or one of its municipalities than the property of an individual. The acts of Congress [...] . conferred on the defendant [telecommunications company] no right to use the streets and alleys of the city [...] . which belonged to the municipality. Although this principle has seemed to be well-settled since 1903, it may be revisited again 92 years later in light of (1) contemporary constitutional challenges, (2) advances in technology, (3) a recent Federal Communications Commission (2 ̆ 2 FCC 2 ̆ 2) action on video dialtone services, and (4) proposed Congressional telecommunications legislation involving telecommunications companies 2 ̆ 7 use of local rights-of-way for the 2 ̆ 2 information superhighway 2 ̆ 2 -that cornucopia of telecommunications services. This article will first examine the municipal and federal authority behind this established legal principle and then analyze the current issues facing it...|$|R
