500|$|After {{returning}} to Colorado Springs, O'Hare, {{who did not}} skate in the 1000m, filed a formal complaint. The complaint was founded on Ohno's seemingly deliberate attempt to stop Biondo {{from being able to}} pass Smith. [...] Because of that blocking move on Biondo, Smith finished in second place and Davis finished first. [...] For three days, Ohno, Smith, and Davis stood before an arbitration panel of the United States Olympic Committee. [...] During the hearing, Davis was never accused of being at fault and Smith made the statement: [...] "Any allegation that there was a fix, conspiracy or understanding between Apolo and me, or anyone else, to let Shani win the race is completely false. Shani is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>athlete,</b> skated a great race, and deserves to be on the team." [...] The final verdict was that O'Hare's claims went unproven, all three were absolved of guilt, and the claim was dismissed. [...] After the dismissal, Ohno stated, [...] "I am thrilled that the arbitration process has officially vindicated me... As I've said since the moment of these accusations, they were untrue and I did nothing wrong".|$|E

According to his obituary in The Philadelphia Inquirer, [...] "his ambition was to stand out prominently as a six-day pedestrian and at the age of eighteen he was out in the world trying to win fame and fortune on the tan bark track."

2500|$|Cappon {{was known}} for his {{conservatism}} as a coach. [...] In 23 years at Princeton, the uniforms never changed, having small sewn-on numbers and no player names. [...] He considered a fast break as a lack of discipline and would not allow his players to shoot before five or ten passes had been completed. [...] In 1995, former Princeton player Selden Edwards wrote an article on Cappon's influence at Princeton. [...] Edwards, a junior varsity player in the Cappon era, wrote that [...] "Cappy was Princeton basketball to anyone even vaguely familiar with the teams of that era." [...] Edwards described Cappon's physical appearance this way: [...] "In 1959, the fall I arrived at Princeton, Cappy was in peak form, a character who knew he was a character. He was in his early sixties, and his body {{looked as if it had}} been sculpted in ice cream and left in the sun. He was bald, the skin on his face drooped, he had deep shadows under his eyes. His voice was gravelly, and he enunciated as if he had wads of Kleenex in his mouth. He always said exactly what he meant, and his language was delightfully salty. Legend had it that he had been <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>athlete</b> at Michigan, but by the 1960s no one could imagine that. He was grumpily personable and totally without pretension." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the other}} end of the smoking-room I ran into a group of men bunched excitedly and angrily around Bertie Messener. And Bertie was {{stirring}} them up and prodding them in his cool, cynical way. Bertie didn't care about the strike. He didn't care much about anything. He was blase--at least in all the clean things of life; the nasty things had no attraction for him. He was worth twenty millions, all of it in safe investments, and he had never done a tap of productive work in his life--inherited it all from his father and two uncles. He had been everywhere, seen everything, and done everything but get married, and this last in the face of the grim and determined attack of a few hundred ambitious mammas. For years he had been the greatest catch, and as yet he had avoided being caught. He was disgracefully eligible. On top of his wealth he was young, handsome, and, as I said before, clean. He was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>athlete,</b> a young blond god that did everything perfectly and admirably with the solitary exception of matrimony.

6000|$|There existed a {{periodical}} entirely {{devoted to}} verse, but nobody knew anybody {{who wrote in}} it. A comic journal was started; I remember the pride with which when a freshman, I received an invitation to join its councils as an artist. I was to do the caricatures of all things. Now, methought, I shall meet the Oxford wits of whom I have read. But the wits were unutterably disappointing, {{and the whole thing}} died early and not lamented. Only one piece of academic literature obtained and deserved success. This was The Oxford Spectator, a most humorous little periodical, in shape and size like Addison's famous journal. The authors were Mr. Reginald Copleston, now Bishop of Colombo, Mr. Humphry Ward, and Mr. Nolan, <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>athlete,</b> who died early. There have been good periodicals since; many amusing things occur in the Echoes from the Oxford Magazine, but the Spectator was the flower of academic journals. [...] "When I look back to my own experience," [...] says the Spectator, [...] "I find one scene, of all Oxford, most deeply engraved upon 'the mindful tablets of my soul.' And yet not a scene, but a fairy compound of smell and sound, and sight and thought. The wonderful scent of the meadow air just above Iffley, on a hot May evening, and the gay colours of twenty boats along the shore, the poles all stretched out from the bank to set the boats clear, and the sonorous cries of 'ten seconds more,' all down from the green barge to the lasher.

6000|$|Meanwhile I {{find it a}} real {{uplifting}} {{privilege to}} live in an air so unterrorized as that of this country, and to feel what confidence we insuperably feel in the big sea-genius, let alone the huge sea-resources, of this people. It is a great experience. I mean the whole process of life here is now--even if it does so abound in tragedy and pity, such as one can often scarcely face. But there is too much of all that to say--and all I intended was to remark that while Germany roars and runs amuck the new armies now at last ready are being oh so quietly transported across the diabolised Channel. The quiet and the steady going here, amid the German vociferation, is of itself an enormous--I was going to say pleasure. We have just heard from Burgess of the arrival of his regiment at Havre--they left the Tower of London but a few days ago.... I go to-morrow to the Protheros to help them with tea-ing a party of convalescent soldiers from hospital--Mrs. J. G. Butcher, like thousands, or at least hundreds, of other people, sends her car on certain afternoons of the week to different hospitals for four of the bettering patients--or as many as will go into it--and they are conveyed either to her house or to some other arranged with. I have [...] "met" [...] sets of them thus several times--the [...] "right people" [...] are wanted for them, and nothing can be more interesting and admirable and verily charming than I mostly find them. The last time the Protheros had, by Mrs. Butcher's car, wounded Belgians--but to-morrow it is to be British, whom I on the whole prefer, though the Belgians are more gravely pathetic. The difficulty about them is that they are so apt to know only Flemish and understand almost no French--save as one of them, always included for the purpose, can interpret. I had to-day to luncheon a most decent and appreciative little sapper in the Engineers, whom I originally found in hospital and whose teeth I have been having done up for him--at very reduced military rates! There is nothing one isn't eager to do for them, and their gratitude for small mercies, excellent stuff as they are, almost wrings the heart. This obscure hero (<b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>athlete</b> in the running line) is completely well again and goes {{in a day or two}} back to the Front; but oh how they don't like the hellishness of it (that is beyond all conception,) and oh how they don't let this make any difference!

40|$|ABSTRACT Hamstring {{injuries}} {{are among the}} most frequent in sports. The high relapse rate is a challenge for sports medicine and has <b>a</b> <b>great</b> impact on <b>athletes</b> and sport teams. The treatment goal is to provide the athlete the same functional level as before the injury. Thus, functional rehabilitation is very important {{to the success of the}} treatment. Currently, several physical therapy modalities are used, according to the stage of the lesion, such as cryotherapy, laser therapy, therapeutic ultrasound, therapeutic exercise, and manual therapy. However, the evidence of the effectiveness of these modalities in muscle injuries is not fully established due to the little scientific research on the topic.
