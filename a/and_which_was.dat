5|$|Although he {{had little}} {{interest}} in formal education and rarely attended classes, Sylvester was enrolled at Jordan High School. He graduated in 1969 at the age of 21; in his graduation photograph, he appeared in drag wearing a blue chiffon prom dress and beehive hairstyle. By the end of the decade, the Disquotays had begun to drift apart, with a number of them abandoning cross-dressing and others recognizing that they were trans women and undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Sylvester always considered himself male and began to tone down the feminine nature of his clothing, aiming for a more androgynous look which combined male and female styles <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> influenced by the fashions of the hippie movement.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{battalion}} undertook {{a series of}} local patrols after this, the fighting around Parramatta constituted {{the last of the}} 2/10th's major actions of the war. After the hostilities ended in mid-August following Japan's surrender, {{the battalion}}'s personnel were slowly repatriated back to Australia in drafts for demobilisation and discharge. Some chose to remain in the Army, with a group of about 70 being transferred to other units for subsequent service in the 34th Brigade, which had been formed to undertake occupation duties in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The battalion was finally disbanded on 29 December 1945 while still at Balikpapan; upon disbandment there were only 42 members of the battalion left for the 2/10th's final parade, during which the battalion flag was entrusted to the Militia 10th Battalion, which had served briefly in a garrison role in Australia during the war <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> subsequently re-raised in South Australia after the war.|$|E

5|$|An {{economic}} downturn was beginning in Canada by 1958. Because {{of tax cuts}} instituted the previous year, the budget presented by the government predicted a small deficit for 1957–58, and a large one, $648million, for the following year. Minister of Finance Fleming and Bank of Canada Governor James Coyne proposed that the wartime Victory Bond issue, which constituted two-thirds of the national debt <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> due to be redeemed by 1967, be refinanced to a longer term. After considerable indecision on Diefenbaker's part, a nationwide campaign took place, and 90% of the bonds were converted.

5|$|Beersheba was {{developed}} by the Ottoman Empire from a camel-trading centre on the northern edge of the Negev, halfway between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea.

Beersheba's hospital, army barracks, railway station (with water tower), engine sheds, large storage buildings, and a square of houses, were well-designed and strongly-constructed stone buildings, with red tiled roofs and a German beer garden. The inhabitants of the region from Beersheba northwards varied; the population was mainly Arabs belonging to Sunni Islam, with some Jewish and Christian colonists.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{rebellion}} at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney write, a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, {{they had an}} advantage which was a disadvantage, too, <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night {{the lives of millions}} of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly.

It also showed that the first line stood on the western face of the arch, while the second on the eastern. According to the current view, this refers to the usurper Joannes (r. 423–425), while according to the supporters of the traditional view, it indicates the gate's construction as a free-standing triumphal arch in 388–391 to commemorate the defeat of the usurper Magnus Maximus (r. 385–388), <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> only later incorporated into the Theodosian Walls.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{conditions}} set out by Tikhon's decree for this temporary autonomy not being met, the American diocese of the Russian church declared self-governance in 1924, against the protests of the patriarchate, {{with which it}} had communication <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> capable of governance had its American branch been willing. The refusal of the American branch {{to submit to the}} patriarchate thus based itself officially on a document whose conditions it had not met.
