5|$|In 1962, a {{group of}} {{researchers}} <b>at</b> <b>Bell</b> Laboratories discovered laser action in xenon, and later found that the laser gain was improved by adding helium to the lasing medium. The first excimer laser used a xenon dimer (Xe2) energized by a beam of electrons to produce stimulated emission at an ultraviolet wavelength of 176 nm.|$|E
5|$|The {{safety culture}} at WCRC {{was found by}} the {{investigation}} to be weak. This was evidenced {{by a number of}} factors, including the lack of traction inspectors, failure to test for drugs and alcohol, failure to download data from OTDRs to analyse individual driver performance, failure to maintain OTDR equipment correctly, failure to report missing seals on safety equipment where they were required to be fitted. Failure to keep proper records. Failure to improve following the incident <b>at</b> <b>Bell</b> Busk (detailed below).|$|E
5|$|In later life, Hamming became {{interested}} in teaching. Between 1960 and 1976, {{when he left the}} Bell labs, he held visiting or adjunct professorships at Stanford University, the City College of New York, the University of California at Irvine and Princeton University. As a Young Turk, Hamming had resented older scientists who had used up space and resources that would have been put to much better use by the young Turks. Looking at a commemorative poster of the Bell Labs' valued achievements, he noted that he had worked on or been associated with nearly all of those listed {{in the first half of}} his career <b>at</b> <b>Bell</b> Labs, but none in the second. He therefore resolved to retire in 1976, after thirty years.|$|E

From the following year the Australian Surf rider's Association - ASA (Victorian Branch) - Now called Surfing Victoria hosted and staged the annual surfing competition <b>at</b> <b>Bells</b> Beach held <b>at</b> Easter each year. The ASA also ran the conservation contest <b>at</b> <b>Bells</b> Beach which included tree planting {{in an effort to}} help preserve natural values every year since the mid-1970s.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, one {{improvement}} to Zeus {{was already}} being studied: a new phased-array radar replacing Zeus' mechanical ones would greatly {{increase the number}} of targets and interceptors that a single site could handle. Much more powerful computers were needed to match this performance. Additionally, the antennas were mounted directly in concrete and would have increased blast resistance. Initial studies <b>at</b> <b>Bell</b> Labs started in 1960 on what was then known as the Zeus Multi-function Array Radar, or ZMAR. In June 1961, Western Electric and Sylvania were selected to build a prototype, with Sperry Rand Univac providing the control computer.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} <b>at</b> <b>Bell</b> Labs before {{the rise of}} the commercial video game industry in the early history of video games, and was ported during 1969 from the Multics operating system to the GECOS operating system on the GE 635 computer, and then to the PDP-7 computer. As a part of porting the game to the PDP-7, Thompson developed his own operating system, which later formed the core of the Unix operating system. Space Travel never spread beyond Bell Labs or had an effect on future games, leaving its primary legacy as part of the original push for the development of Unix.|$|E
5|$|Although early {{computers}} such as EDSAC made successful use {{of mercury}} delay line memory, the technology had several drawbacks; it was heavy, it was expensive, {{and it did}} not allow data to be accessed randomly. In addition, because data was stored as a sequence of acoustic waves propagated through a mercury column, the device's temperature had to be very carefully controlled, as the velocity of sound through a medium varies with its temperature. Williams had seen an experiment <b>at</b> <b>Bell</b> Labs demonstrating the effectiveness of cathode ray tubes (CRT) {{as an alternative to the}} delay line for removing ground echoes from radar signals. While working at the TRE, shortly before he joined the University of Manchester in December 1946, he and Tom Kilburn had developed a form of electronic memory known as the Williams or Williams–Kilburn tube based on a standard CRT, the first random-access digital storage device. The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) was designed to show that the system was a practical storage device, by testing that data held within it could be read and written at the speed necessary for use in a computer.|$|E

5|$|On 1 July 1958, {{responding}} to Eisenhower's call, the nuclear powers convened the Conference of Experts in Geneva, aimed at studying means of detecting nuclear tests. The conference included {{scientists from the}} US, Britain, the Soviet Union, Canada, Czechoslovakia, France, Poland, and Romania. The US delegation was led by James Fisk, a member of PSAC, the Soviets by Evgenii Fedorov, and the British delegation by William Penney, who had led the British delegation to the Manhattan Project. Whereas the US approached the conference solely from a technical perspective, Penney was specifically instructed by Macmillan to attempt to achieve a political agreement. This difference in approach {{was reflected in the}} broader composition of the US and UK teams. US experts were primarily drawn from academia and industry. Fisk was a vice president <b>at</b> <b>Bell</b> Telephone Laboratories and was joined by Robert Bacher and Ernest Lawrence, both physicists who had worked on the Manhattan Project. Conversely, British delegates largely held government positions. The Soviet delegation was composed primarily of academics, though virtually all of them had some link to the Soviet government. The Soviets shared the British goal of achieving an agreement at the conference.|$|E
5|$|Some {{mainframe}} {{games that}} did not appear in 101 BASIC Computer Games have still had a lasting impact. One such game was Space Travel, developed by Ken Thompson in 1969, which simulates travel in the Solar System. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model {{of the solar system}} with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, and adjust the overall speed by adjusting the scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational pull of the astronomical bodies. The game was developed <b>at</b> <b>Bell</b> Labs, and was ported during 1969 from the Multics operating system to the GECOS operating system on the GE 635 computer, and then to the PDP-7 minicomputer. While porting the game to the PDP-7, Thompson developed ideas for his own operating system, which later formed the core of the Unix operating system. Space Travel never spread beyond Bell Labs or had an effect on future games, leaving its primary legacy as part of the original push for the development of Unix.|$|E
5|$|The {{piezoelectric}} {{properties of}} crystalline quartz were discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880. The first quartz crystal oscillator {{was built by}} Walter G. Cady in 1921, and in 1927 the first quartz clock was built by Warren Marrison and J. W. Horton <b>at</b> <b>Bell</b> Telephone Laboratories in Canada. The following decades saw the development of quartz clocks as precision time measurement devices in laboratory settings—the bulky and delicate counting electronics, built with vacuum tubes, limited their practical use elsewhere. In 1932, a quartz clock able to measure small weekly variations in the rotation rate of the Earth was developed. The National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the time standard of the United States on quartz clocks from late 1929 until the 1960s, when it changed to atomic clocks. In 1969, Seiko produced the world's first quartz wristwatch, the Astron. Their inherent accuracy and low cost of production {{has resulted in the}} subsequent proliferation of quartz clocks and watches.|$|E
