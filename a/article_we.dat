25|$|In {{functional}} analysis and linear algebra the spectral theorem establishes {{conditions under which}} an operator can be expressed in simple form as a sum of simpler operators.

25|$|Since the 1960s, {{improving}} {{the efficiency of}} foreign aid has been a common topic of academic research. There is debate on whether foreign aid is efficacious, but {{for the purposes of}} this <b>article</b> <b>we</b> will ignore that. Given that schema, a common debate is over which factors influence the overall economic efficiency of foreign aid. Indeed, there is debate about whether aid impact should be measured empirically at all, but again, we will limit our scope to increasing the economic efficiency.|$|E

30|$|The Web of Science {{database}} {{is considered}} {{as the main}} source for <b>articles.</b> <b>We</b> used concurrently both “crowdsourcing” and “open innovation” as keywords to search articles. On the Web of Science database, articles are classified into various categories. We selected two categories – business and management – to extract articles on crowdsourcing which have been published under those two disciplines. <b>We</b> extracted all <b>articles</b> under B&M disciplines, which contain both crowdsourcing and open innovation terms. Altogether 49 articles have been found through our search on the Web of Science database. However, after reading all articles, 42 are included for analysis and other seven articles left out for their irrelevancy. To include more <b>articles,</b> <b>we</b> searched on the Scopus database and found additional seven <b>articles.</b> <b>We</b> searched on Google scholar and found one more article. Thus, 50 articles have been finally considered for this study purpose. Moreover, articles appeared in top-tier outlets on crowdfunding are additionally considered.
