40|$|Graduation date: 2017 This {{work is a}} {{culmination}} {{of a series of}} published works related {{to the use of the}} Material Point Method (MPM) in modeling wood <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonds.</b> The use of wood as construction material has the potential to play a small role in the solution to the current CO 2 and climate change crisis. Therefore, wood as an engineering and structural material appears to have increased popularity among green-minded architects and builders. Much of wood used as a structural or engineering material is in the form of a wood composite, common examples include plywood, oriented strand board (OSB), laminated veneer lumber (LVL), particle board, cross-laminated timber (CLT), and others. Clearly, a vital component of all these products is the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> between the pieces of wood. The motivation of this work is to thoroughly understand the mechanics and properties of a wood <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> through the use of computational numerical modeling. A detailed and full-featured customized numerical modeling paradigm for wood <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonds</b> using MPM is introduced. The effective goal is to start with a specific wood structure and the liquid properties of an uncured adhesive, and to fully model and verify every aspect of the wood <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> with MPM. This is a complex endeavor and has several intermediate steps, including modeling how adhesive flows into the wood structure and modeling the mechanical performance of the wood <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonds.</b> To improve the modeling of fluids and fluid-structure interaction in MPM, an advancement called XPIC (eXtended Particle In Cell) was invented and introduced to significantly reduce noise and high frequency oscillations in MPM simulations. XPIC was used to improve MPM simulations in all the chapters of this dissertation. MPM simulations were used to model the pressure-driven flow of uncured adhesive in a wood structure, created using XCT scans of actual wood <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> segments. These simulations are verified against experimental x-ray data. To model the mechanical performance of a wood bond, mechanical properties are needed, ideally the properties of the particular piece of wood. This is partially achievable with nanoindentation. However, the standard methods for analyzing nanoindentation don't apply to the anisotropic wood cell walls and further numerical modeling is needed. The use of MPM for modeling nanoindentation is investigated and it is found that MPM is well suited to handle this modeling and that numerical modeling is indeed important for accurate and consistent material properties. Finally, modeling the mechanical performance of a wood <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> with the geometry created from the adhesive squeezing simulations or from XCT data is investigated. MPM simulations investigating the mechanical behavior of wood-adhesive bonds are compared with experimental data obtained from DVC analysis of XCT scans of wood specimens under load. Not every step in the proposed overarching modeling paradigm has been fully completed but progress has been made toward each step. And the feasibility of each step is demonstrated. Once the modeling paradigm has been fully implemented with MPM and verified with experiments, the next phase is to use this modeling to further the understanding of wood <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonds,</b> to suggest and inform additional experiments, and to optimize <b>adhesives</b> and <b>bonding</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Small and {{hydrophilic}} monomers as HEMA and TEGDMA {{can easily}} penetrate human tissues. For biocompatibility issues {{it is therefore}} better to avoid such monomers in dental adhesive formulations. The {{purpose of this study}} was (1) to determine the micro-tensile bond strength (muTBS) to enamel/dentin of a HEMA/TEGDMA-free three-step etch&rinse adhesive (cmf Adhesive System, Saremco), and (2) to characterize it's interfacial interaction with enamel/dentin using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). METHODS: Twelve intact freshly extracted human third molars were used for muTBS. The three-step etch&rinse adhesive OptiBond FL (Kerr) served as control <b>adhesive.</b> After <b>bonding</b> <b>procedures</b> and subsequent composite build-up (Z 100, 3 M ESPE), specimens were sectioned to sticks and trimmed at the interface to a cylindrical hour-glass shape. TEM section of non-demineralized and demineralized sections were prepared by ultra-microtomy and examined. RESULTS: The muTBS of the cmf Adhesive System to enamel was not statistically significantly different from that of the control (OptiBond FL) adhesive (p= 0. 3512); the muTBS to dentin was however significantly lower (p< 0. 0001). TEM showed a tight interface at enamel for both adhesives. A relatively thick, completely demineralized and acid-resistant hybrid layer was formed at dentin. Some degree of spot- and cluster-like nano-leakage was observed with cmf Adhesive System, but did not differ in extent and form in comparison to that observed with the OptiBond FL control. CONCLUSIONS: The new three-step adhesive cmf Adhesive System showed indications of good bonding effectiveness, certainly to enamel and only significantly lower to dentin, when compared to the gold-standard adhesive. The latter may be related to the adapted HEMA/TEGDMA-free formulation and the somewhat lower mechanical properties. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{ultrasonic}} {{techniques to}} nondestructively evaluate <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> degradation have been studied. The {{key to the}} present approach is the introduction of an external factor which pulls the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> in the nonlinear range, simultaneously with the application of an ultrasonic technique. With the aid of an external static tensile loading, a superimposed longitudinal wave has. been used to obtain {{the slopes of the}} stress-strain curve of an <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> at a series of load levels. The critical load, at which a reduction of the slope is detected by the superimposed longitudinal wave, is an indication of the onset of nonlinear behavior of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond,</b> and therefore of bond degradation. This approach has been applied to the detection of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> degradation induced by cyclic fatigue loading. Analogously to the longitudinal wave case, a superimposed shear wave has been used to obtain the effective shear modulus of adhesive layers at different shear load levels. The onset of the nonlinear behavior of an <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> under shear loading has been detected by the use of a superimposed shear wave. Experiments show that a longitudinal wave can also detect the nonlinear behavior when an <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> is subjected to shear loading. An optimal combination of ultrasonic testing and mechanical loading methods for the detection of degradation related nonlinear behavior of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonds</b> has been discussed. For the purpose of a practical application, an ultrasonic technique that uses a temperature increase as an alternative to static loading has also been investigated. A general strain-temperature correspondence principle that relates a mechanical strain to a temperature has been presented. Explicit strain-temperature correspondence relations for both the tension and shear cases have been derived. An important parameter which quantifies the relation between the wave velocity and temperature has been defined. This parameter, which is indicative of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> nonlinearity and which can be conveniently obtained by an ultrasonic measurement, has been used as an indication of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> degradation.

40|$|Part 4 : Metrology and Quality ControlInternational audienceAdhesive bonding for {{industrial}} purposes has, {{over the last}} years, become more important compared to conventional joining methods, due to application in miniaturized systems where other ways of joining are too bulky.

The effects of the heated water environments on the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonding</b> layer between the CFRP and concrete beams were evaluated by quantifying: (1) the changes of delaminations within the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonding</b> layer, (2) the changes in resistance to direct shear force and (3) the changes of failure mode distribution. Before the exposure, the condition of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonding</b> layer was inspected by infrared thermography (IRT). After exposure, the deterioration of the same bonding layer and failure mode distributions were measured by analyzing the visual photos on the failed CFRP strips. The failure modes were found to be affected largely by the combined effect of elevated temperature and moisture ingress, in which three types were identified: failure at concrete beams, at <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonding</b> layer and interface between CFRP strip and concrete.
