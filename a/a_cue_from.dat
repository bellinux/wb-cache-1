25|$|In the 1890s, Edwardes {{hit upon}} a new {{strategy}} for the Gaiety, which was a variation from the kinds of shows that he and Carte had produced and also had elements of the Gaiety burlesques and of music hall entertainments. The earliest of these shows, taking <b>a</b> <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> Dorothy, had a musical style similar to the Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas. Into this mix, he incorporated some {{of the elements of}} the form that Harrigan & Hart had established on Broadway a decade earlier. Like Thomas German Reed and W. S. Gilbert before him, Edwardes wanted to produce musical plays that were more respectable (and would attract a more affluent, polite crowd) than risqué burlesque. But Edwardes sought pieces that integrated spoken dialogue and music in a lighter, less satiric way than Gilbert and Sullivan had, using topical songs, fashionable costumes and sassy byplay between the characters.|$|E

500|$|While the Sejm {{comprised}} representatives only of {{the nobility}} and clergy, the reformers were supported by the burghers (townspeople), who {{in the fall of}} 1789 organized a Black Procession, demonstrating their desire {{to be part of the}} political process. Taking <b>a</b> <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> similar events in France, and with the fear that if burghers' demands were not met, their peaceful protests could turn violent, the Sejm on April 18, 1791 adopted a law addressing the status of the cities and the rights of the burghers (the Free Royal Cities Act).

Degrassi focuses on a high school with a disparate student body, with countless individual stories to tell (which is why the franchise has lasted this long). There's nothing corny or sweet about [...] "Degrassi" [...] as it boldly tackles everything from obesity to date rape, thongs to drugs". Others, such as The Advocate gave praise and said the series was breaking new ground by depicting a gay romance between two teenaged boys.|$|E
