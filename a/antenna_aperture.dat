Of particular interest is the design of FSS structures whose reflection coefficient has prespecified phase response over a broad set of frequencies. Previous FSSs primarily considered designs on the basis of the reflection-coefficient am-plitude and were intended for radome applications rather than substrates. Designing FSSs subject to phase requirements will be seen to require some compromise in the magnitude. Broad-band requirements also present us with a need for noncommensurate FSS designs.

50|$|In general, the <b>aperture</b> of an <b>antenna</b> is not {{directly}} related to its physical size. However some types of antennas, for example parabolic dishes and horns, have a physical aperture (opening) which collects the radio waves. In these <b>aperture</b> <b>antennas,</b> the effective <b>aperture</b> Aeff must always be less than the area of the <b>antenna's</b> physical <b>aperture</b> Aphys, as {{can be seen from the}} definition above. An <b>antenna's</b> <b>aperture</b> efficiency, ea is defined as the ratio of these two areas:The aperture efficiency is a dimensionless parameter between 0 and 1.0 that measures how close the antenna comes to using all the radio power entering its physical <b>aperture.</b> If the <b>antenna</b> were perfectly efficient, all the radio power falling within its physical aperture would be converted to electrical power delivered to the load attached to its output terminals, so these two areas would be equal Aeff = Aphys and the aperture efficiency would be 1.0. But all antennas have losses, such as power dissipated as heat in the resistance of its elements, nonuniform illumination by its feed, and radio waves scattered by structural supports and diffraction at the aperture edge, which reduce the power output. Aperture efficiencies of typical antennas vary from 0.35 to 0.70 but can range up to 0.90.|$|R

Due to the limited number of connection points into trackside fibre-optic cables (ca. one per 5 km), and the limited spacing possible between trackside-to-train links (ca. 100 m due to fog), novel solutions for track-side communications backbones are needed. We estimate the total capacity as being in the order of 40 Gbit/s, which requires the investigation of novel means of providing spectral efficiency.

50|$|So {{the power}} output of an antenna in watts {{is equal to}} the power density of the radio waves in watts per square metre, multiplied by its {{aperture}} in square metres. The larger an <b>antenna's</b> <b>aperture</b> is, the more power it can collect from a given field of radio waves. To actually obtain the predicted power available Po, the polarization of the incoming waves must match the polarization of the antenna, and the load (receiver) must be impedance matched to the antenna's feedpoint impedance.|$|R

50|$|In {{simple terms}} the {{frequency}} dependency {{of the path}} loss can be explained like this: {{with the increase of}} the frequency the requirement to keep the gain of the receiving antenna intact will cause an <b>antenna</b> <b>aperture</b> to be decreased, which will result in less energy being captured with the smaller antenna, which is similar to increasing the path loss in the situation when receiving antenna gain would not have been fixed.|$|E
50|$|In addition, it {{is found}} that the value of β changes very little as the stub is moved, and α varies over a very large range. This feature allows to taper the <b>antenna</b> <b>aperture</b> to control sidelobes.The fact that the L-shaped {{structure}} strongly leaks may also be related to another leakage mechanism: the use of leaky higher modes. In particular, it may be found that all the groove-guide higher modes are leaky.|$|E

5000|$|Hence {{path loss}} is a {{convenient}} tool; {{it represents a}} hypothetical received-power loss that would occur if the receiving antenna were isotropic. Therefore, the FSPL {{can be viewed as}} a convenient collection of terms that have been assigned the unfortunate name path loss. This name calls up an image of purely geometric effect and fails to emphasize the requirement that [...] A better choice of the name would have been unity-gain propagation loss. Hence frequency dependency of the path loss is caused by the frequency dependency of the receiving antenna's aperture in case the antenna gain is fixed. <b>Antenna</b> <b>aperture</b> in turn determines how well an antenna can pick up power from an incoming electromagnetic wave.|$|E

40|$|This book is {{intended}} as an advanced text for courses in antennas, {{with a focus}} on the mature but vital background field of <b>aperture</b> <b>antennas.</b> The book is aimed at final year, MSc, PhD and Post-Doctoral students, as well as readers who are moving from academia into industry, beginning careers as wireless engineers, system designers, in R&D, or for practising engineers. It assumes the reader has undertaken an earlier course of study on Maxwell's equations, fields and waves. Some of these topics are summarised in the early few chapters in order to provide continuity and background for the remaining chapters. The <b>aperture</b> <b>antennas</b> covered include the main types of horns, reflectors and arrays as well as microstrip patches, reflectarrays and lenses. To provide more than a superficial treatment of arrays, the topic of mutual coupling is covered in greater detail than most similar books in the area. Also included is an introduction to arrays on non-planar surfaces, which is of importance for applications that involve curved surfaces such as in aerodynamics or for making <b>aperture</b> <b>antennas</b> unobtrusive. A chapter is included on some modern <b>aperture</b> <b>antennas</b> to illustrate design techniques beyond the most common types of <b>aperture</b> <b>antennas</b> described in the early chapters. This is to show where advances have recently been made and where they could be improved in the future. Also included are selected topics of a practical nature for <b>aperture</b> <b>antennas,</b> namely fabrication and measurement. 430 page(s...|$|R
