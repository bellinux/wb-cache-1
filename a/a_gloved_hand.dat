25|$|LucasArts' {{previous}} graphic adventure, Sam & Max Hit the Road (1993), {{introduced a}} new inventory and interaction system to replace those of their prior games, which had taken up the lower third of the player's screen. Full Throttle continued to refine on the changes introduced in Sam & Max Hit the Road: Objects or characters with which Ben can interact are indicated by a red square appearing around the cursor's crosshairs when the cursor is placed over the object. When this occurs, holding down the left mouse button causes a contextual pie menu {{to appear in the}} shape of the emblem of Ben's biker gang: a flaming circle topped by a skull and flanked by a boot and <b>a</b> <b>gloved</b> <b>hand.</b> The player hovers the cursor over elements of the emblem and then releases the mouse button to attempt various interactions with the object; for example, selecting the skull's mouth to speak to a character, its eyes to examine an object, or the hand to pick up, use, or pull the object. Right-clicking anywhere on the screen brings up the player's inventory of collected objects, which can be examined or dragged and dropped in order to use them with other items in the inventory or with objects or characters in the scene. These gameplay features would be further developed for The Curse of Monkey Island (1997).|$|E
2500|$|The Strokes {{released}} {{their debut}} album, Is This It, in the US in October 2001. The album {{was produced by}} Gordon Raphael, as was their follow-up album Room On Fire. RCA delayed the North American (US) release over concerns with the album’s cover and lyrics. The UK-released cover features a black-and-white photo of <b>a</b> <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> on a woman's naked backside, shown in semi-profile (photographer Colin Lane's then-girlfriend,) while the North American version {{replaced it with a}} photo of particle collisions in the Big European Bubble Chamber. RCA replaced the track [...] "New York City Cops" [...] with [...] "When It Started", as the former featured potentially inflammatory lyrics {{in the wake of the}} [...] September 11 attacks. The track [...] "New York City Cops"—featuring the refrain, “New York City Cops, they ain't too smart”—was listed as No. 12 on New York Magazines [...] "Ultimate New York Playlist" [...] on March 1, 2010. Despite its delayed release (and the potential controversy), Is This It received critical acclaim—among other accolades, four stars from Rolling Stone, and a 9.1 from Pitchfork Media. The album made many critic's top-ten lists, was named the best album of the year by Entertainment Weekly and TIME, and (in an article previewing summer concerts) NME urged readers to attend the Strokes’ shows—as they were touring some of the [...] "best pop songs ever." [...] While critics noted the influence of CBGB stalwarts Television, Casablancas and bandmates claimed to have never heard the band, instead citing the Velvet Underground as a reference point.|$|E

60|$|He {{turned the}} white-legged horse round the street corner, and sought one shining window from among {{those at the}} back of the house.

These were the things he carried with him as he turned away again, and rode through the darkening and deserted Parks at a quick rate.|$|E

60|$|Ida {{smiled a}} little as she remembered a man of {{considerable}} importance in the wheat-lands of Assiniboia, whom she had last seen sitting, clad in blue shirt and very old trousers, on a huge machine which a double span of reeking horses hauled through the splendid grain. He had driven it since sunrise, and it was dusk of evening then, and his wants were, as she knew, remarkably simple. He bore {{his share of the}} burden under a burning sun, but it seemed to her that, had Weston been in his place, he would have ridden around that farm with <b>a</b> <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> on his hip, and would have raised it only now and then, imperiously, to direct the toilers. Then she thought of another man, who was like him in some respects, and was then, in all probability, plodding through the lonely bush.|$|E
60|$|Thus aroused, Austen {{made his}} way towards the vacant chair, {{and when he was}} seated raised his eyes to the gallery rail, and Mr. Crewe, the {{legislative}} chamber, and its audience ceased to exist. It is quite impossible--unless one is a poetical genius--to reproduce on paper that gone and sickly sensation which is, paradoxically, so exquisite. The psychological cause of it in this instance was, primarily, the sight, by Austen Vane, of his own violets on a black, tailor-made gown trimmed with wide braid, and secondarily of an oval face framed in a black hat, the subtle curves of which no living man could describe. The face was turned in his direction, and he felt an additional thrill when he realized that she must have been watching him as he came in, for she was leaning forward with <b>a</b> <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> on the railing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Charming attention!" [...] said Pandora Day {{with the}} laugh that seemed always {{to invite the}} whole of any company to partake in it; though for some moments after this she and her {{interlocutor}} appeared to continue the conversation only with their eyes. Meanwhile Vogelstein's also were not idle. He looked at her visitor from head to foot, and {{he was aware that}} she was quite unconscious of his own proximity. The gentleman before him was tall, good-looking, well- dressed; evidently he would stand well not only at Utica, but, judging from the way he had planted himself on the dock, in any position that circumstances might compel him to take up. He was about forty years old; he had a black moustache and he seemed to look at the world over some counter-like expanse on which he invited it all warily and pleasantly to put down first its idea of the terms of a transaction. He waved <b>a</b> <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> at Pandora as if, when she exclaimed [...] "Gracious, ain't they long!" [...] to urge her to be patient. She was patient several seconds and then asked him if he had any news. He looked at her briefly, in silence, smiling, after which he drew from his pocket a large letter with an official-looking seal and shook it jocosely above his head. This was discreetly, covertly done. No one but our young man appeared aware of how much was taking place--and poor Count Otto mainly felt it in the air. The boat was touching the wharf and the space between the pair inconsiderable.|$|E

60|$|And the superior-minded critic yawned behind <b>a</b> well <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> and {{dubbed the}} play melodramatic, unreal, and stagey, quite {{foreign to the}} life of to-day.

6000|$|Through {{the great}} arched {{window of the}} hall I saw the hotel brougham waiting at the door. On passing {{the door of the}} front room (it was {{originally}} meant for a drawing-room but a bed for Blunt was put in there) I banged with my fist on the panel and shouted: “I am obliged to go out. Your mother’s carriage is at the door.” I didn’t think he was asleep. My view now was that he was aware beforehand of the subject of the conversation, and if so I did not wish to appear as if I had slunk away from him after the interview. But I didn’t stop—I didn’t want to see him—and before he could answer I was already half way up the stairs running noiselessly up the thick carpet which also covered the floor of the landing. Therefore opening the door of my sitting-room quickly I caught by surprise the person who was in there watching the street half concealed by the window curtain. It was a woman. A totally unexpected woman. A perfect stranger. She came away quickly to meet me. Her face was veiled and she was dressed in a dark walking costume and a very simple form of hat. She murmured: “I had an idea that Monsieur was in the house,” raising <b>a</b> <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> to lift her veil. It was Rose and she gave me a shock. I had never seen her before but with her little black silk apron and a white cap with ribbons on her head. This outdoor dress was like a disguise. I asked anxiously: ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{one moment}} her lips {{clung to his}} with all their might. She {{wrenched}} them away, felt for the handle blindly, opened the door, and, shutting it in his face, went slowly, swaying a little, down the stairs. She trailed <b>a</b> <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> along the wall, as if its solidity could help her. At the last half-landing, where a curtain hung, dividing off back premises, she stopped and listened. There wasn't a sound. 'If I stand here behind this curtain,' she thought, 'I shall see him again.' She slipped behind the curtain, close drawn but for a little chink. It was so dark there {{that she could not}} see her own hand. She heard the door open, and his slow footsteps coming down the stairs. His feet, knees, whole figure came into sight, his face just a dim blur. He passed, smoking a cigarette. She crammed her hand against her mouth to stop herself from speaking and the crushed gardenia filled her nostrils with its cold, fragrant velvet. He was gone, the door below was shut. A wild, half-stupid longing came on her to go up again, wait till he came in, throw herself upon him, tell him she was going, beg him to keep her with him. Ah! and he would! He would look at her with that haggard pity she could not bear, and say, [...] "Of course, Leila, of course." [...] No! By God, no! [...] "I am going quietly home," [...] she muttered; [...] "just quietly home! Come along, be brave; don't be a fool! Come along!" [...] And she went down into the street: At the entrance to the Park she saw him, fifty yards in front, dawdling along. And, {{as if she had been}} his shadow lengthened out to that far distance, she moved behind him. Slowly, always at that distance, she followed him under the plane-trees, along the Park railings, past St. James's Palace, into Pall Mall. He went up some steps, and vanished into his Club. It was the end. She looked up at the building; a monstrous granite tomb, all dark. An emptied cab was just moving from the door. She got in. [...] "Camelot Mansions, St. John's Wood." [...] And braced against the cushions, panting, and clenching her hands, she thought: 'Well, I've seen him again. Hard crust's better than no bread. Oh, God! All finished--not a crumb, not a crumb! Vive-la, vive-la, vive-la ve. Vive-la compagnie!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Bosengate {{received}} the announcement with equanimity. He {{would be home}} even earlier! And gathering up the sheets of paper he had scribbled on, he put them {{in his pocket and}} got up. The would-be suicide was being taken out of the court--a shambling drab figure with shoulders hunched. What good were men like that in these days! What good! The prisoner looked up. Mr. Bosengate encountered in full the gaze of those large brown eyes, with the white showing underneath. What a suffering, wretched, pitiful face! A man had no business to give you a look like that! The prisoner passed on down the stairs, and vanished. Mr. Bosengate went out and across the market place to the garage of the hotel where he had left his car. The sun shone fiercely and he thought: 'I must do some watering in the garden.' He brought the car out, and was about to start the engine, when someone passing said: [...] "Good evenin'. Seedy-lookin' beggar that last prisoner, ain't he? We don't want men of that stamp." [...] It was his neighbour on the jury, the commercial traveller, in a straw hat, with a little brown bag already in his hand and the froth of an interrupted drink on his moustache. Answering curtly: [...] "Good evening!" [...] and thinking: 'Nor of yours, my friend!' Mr. Bosengate started the car with unnecessary clamour. But as if brought back to life by the commercial traveller's remark, the prisoner's figure seemed to speed along too, turning up at Mr. Bosengate his pitifully unhappy eyes. Want of his wife!--queer excuse that for trying to put it out of his power ever to see her again! Why! Half a loaf, even a slice, was better than no bread. Not many of that neurotic type in the Army--thank Heaven! The lugubrious figure vanished, and Mr. Bosengate pictured instead the form of his own wife bending over her [...] "Gloire de Dijon roses" [...] in the rosery, where she generally worked a little before tea now that they were short of gardeners. He saw her, as often he had seen her, raise herself and stand, head to one side, <b>a</b> <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> on her slender hip, gazing as it were ironically from under drooped lids at buds which did not come out fast enough. And the word 'Caline,' for he was something of a French scholar, shot through his mind: 'Kathleen--Caline!' If he found her there when he got in, he would steal up on the grass and--ah! but with great care not to crease her dress or disturb her hair! 'If only she weren't quite so self-contained,' he thought; 'It's like a cat you can't get near, not really near!' ...|$|E
