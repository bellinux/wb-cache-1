25|$|Conflicts of {{interest}} can arise when the professional responsibilities {{of a teacher}} are affected, or appear to be affected, by a special personal relationship with a student. These can include showing favoritism towards a student sexually involved with the teacher, or hostility towards a student due to a past relationship. If <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> sexually involved with a student, colleagues may feel pressured to give preferential treatment to the student, such as better marks, extensions on essays, extra help, or academic opportunities. When there are multiple relationships between several staff and students, the possibilities for conflict {{of interest}} are enormous. Even {{if there is no}} favoritism or hostility, it can be perceived by others to be exhibited.|$|E
25|$|Captains of House are {{slightly}} different though {{in that they}} play a more personal role for pupils who want to voice problems with conditions within the house and this often means that House Captains {{have a lot more}} pupils to be responsible for.

They tend to be in close contact with the housemaster so that any issues requiring immediate attention can be sorted out as well as being able to relay any general ideas or concerns in the House Captains' Council which meet once every two weeks.

25|$|Childhood amnesia (also {{known as}} {{infantile}} amnesia) {{is the common}} inability to remember events from one's own childhood. Sigmund Freud notoriously attributed this to sexual repression, while modern scientific approaches generally attribute it to aspects of brain development or developmental psychology, including language development, which may be why people do not easily remember pre-language events. Researchers have found that implicit memories cannot be recalled or described. Remembering {{how to play the}} piano is a common example of implicit memory, as is walking, speaking and other everyday activities that would be difficult to focus on if they had to be relearned every time one got up in the morning. Explicit memories, on the other hand, can be recalled and described in words. Remembering the first time meeting <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> an example of explicit memories.|$|E

25|$|In the Indian {{education}} system, a teacher’s {{success is}} loosely defined. It is either {{based on a}} student’s success or based on the years of teaching experience, both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher’s skill set or competencies. The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, {{both of which are}} often not an indicator of a good teacher. This means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager. Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, {{there is a need to}} identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.|$|E

Although Rowling has said that Gilderoy Lockhart is her only character that she [...] "deliberately based on a real person", Snape was reportedly based, at least in part, on John Nettleship, who taught Rowling chemistry and employed her mother as an assistant at Wyedean School near Chepstow.

2500|$|In 2003 Helen Giddings, a Democratic {{member of}} the Texas House of Representatives, first {{authored}} the anti student-teacher sex bill but only intended for it to into effect if the student is 17 or younger. Warren Chisum of Pampa removed the maximum age from the bill. The bill was passed in 2003. Shortly after the law passed, a teacher engaged in sexual intercourse with her 18-year-old student, and a Texas court refused to indict her. In 2011 an amendment made it so that <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> forbidden from having sexual relations with any student in his/her school district, not just his/her school. Afterwards criminal prosecutions of teachers in relationships with students going to other schools in the same school district, including teachers of other educational levels, began occurring.

2500|$|The best {{indicator}} of teacher quality, according to Dewey, {{is the ability}} to watch and respond to the movement of the mind with keen awareness of the signs and quality of the responses he or her students exhibit with regard to the subject-matter presented (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, 1904). [...] As Dewey notes, [...] "I have often been asked how it was that some teachers who have never studied the art of teaching are still extraordinarily good teachers. [...] The explanation is simple. [...] They have a quick, sure and unflagging sympathy with the operations and process of the minds they are in contact with. [...] Their own minds move in harmony with those of others, appreciating their difficulties, entering into their problems, sharing their intellectual victories" [...] (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.36). [...] Such <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> genuinely aware of the complexities of this mind to mind transfer, and she has the intellectual fortitude to identify the successes and failures of this process, as well as how to appropriately reproduce or correct it in the future.|$|E

Rabbi Jose deduced that the man of discernment (navan) is of a higher degree than the wise man (hacham), for even a pupil who gives new ideas to <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> called [...] "wise." [...] A wise man knows for himself as much as is required, but the man of discernment apprehends the whole, knowing both his {{own point of view}} and that of others.

Rabbi Jose taught that the man of discernment apprehends the lower world and the upper world, his own being and the being of others.|$|E
2500|$|According to Sansone and Morgan, when {{students}} are already motivated to engage in an activity for their own personal pleasure and then a teacher provides the student with feedback, the type of feedback given can change the way that student views the activity and can even undermine their intrinsic motivation. [...] Maclellan also looked at the relationship between tutors and students and in particular, {{and the type of}} feedback the tutor would give to the student. Maclellan’s results showed that praise or criticism directed towards the student generated a feeling of “fixed intelligence” while praise and criticism directed towards the effort and strategy used by the student generated a feeling of “malleable intelligence” [...] [...] In other words, feedback concerning effort and strategy leaves students knowing that there is room for growth. This is important because {{when students}} believe their intelligence is “fixed”, their mindset can prevent skill development because students will believe that they only have a “certain amount” of understanding on a particular subject matter and might not even try.Therefore, it’s crucial that <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> aware of how the feedback they give to their students can both positively and negatively impact the student’s engagement and motivation [...]|$|E
2500|$|The trouble though is, {{that this}} productive/unproductive {{distinction}} {{is not easily}} made in practice, given changes in the market, in social-organizational efficiency, and in production techniques, {{and it does not}} necessarily {{have anything to do with}} whether a worker produces something tangible or not. What looks like an efficiency gain from [...] "weeding out" [...] seemingly unproductive activity may in fact not be an efficiency gain in total, or it may be very difficult to prove that it is. If fewer workers are made to do more work, intensifying labor, then accidents, illness or errors may increase. In the real world, technical efficiency and financial efficiency are not necessarily the same thing at all. Hence there is continual debate in management theory about these issues, with few [...] "general" [...] answers being available, since much depends on the specific organizational technique of enterprises. The only [...] "general" [...] answer there is, is to recast the accounting for every detailed activity that workers perform as a statistically observable input-output relationship which results in a [...] "product", even if the [...] "product" [...] is no real product at all, but some kind of service or performance result. By describing a labor-service or a task performance as a product, it seems identifiably productive, although substantively it may not create any new product. In Marxist theory, this is called the [...] "commodification of services": each specific service is accounted for as a specific alienable product with a certain price tag, and managed accordingly. Eventually, many services which have to be performed by trained staff are replaced by mass-produced things, because that is more profitable and cheaper to buy.
