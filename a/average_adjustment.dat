Estimating a dynamic factor model for 404 inflation sub-indices of the euro area CPI allows to decompose the dynamics of inflation sub-indices into a part due to a common macroeconomic shock and to sector specific idiosyncratic shocks. Although idiosyncratic shocks dominate the variance of sectoral prices, one common factor {{appears to be the}} main driver of aggregate dynamics. In addition, the heterogenous propagation of this common shock across sectoral inflation rates, and in particular its slow propagation to inflation rates Of Services, generates the persistence of aggregate inflation. We conclude that the aggregation mechanism explains a significant amount of aggregate inflation persistence. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

This paper addresses {{the question of how to}} measure the accuracy of such adjustments. We show that many existing error measures are generally not suited to the task due to specific features of the demand data. Alongside well-known weaknesses of existing measures a number of additional effects are demonstrated that complicate the interpretation of measurement results and even can lead to false conclusions being drawn. To ensure an interpretable and unambiguous evaluation we recommend the use of a metric based on aggregating performance ratios across time series using the weighted geometric mean. We illustrate that this measure has the advantage of treating over and under-forecasting even-handedly, a more symmetric distribution and is robust. Empirical analysis using the recommended metric showed that on <b>average</b> <b>adjustments</b> yielded improvements under symmetric linear loss, but in terms of some traditional measures adjustments harmed accuracy. As a consequence, further support is given to the critical importance of selecting appropriate error measures when evaluating forecasting accuracy...|$|R

We first estimate a dynamic factor model for 404 inflation sub-indices of the euro area CPI. This allows to decompose the dynamics of inflation sub-indices in two parts: one due to a common "macroeconomic" shock and one due to sector specific "idiosyncratic" shocks. Although "idiosyncratic" shocks dominate the variance of sectoral prices, one common factor, which accounts for 30 per cent of the overall variance of the 404 disaggregate inflation series, is the main driver of aggregate dynamics. In addition, the heterogenous propagation of this common shock across sectoral inflation rates, and in particular its slow propagation to inflation rates of services, generates the persistence of aggregate inflation.

40|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 1992 single-market deadline, there were {{concerns}} that inter-industry adjustment pressures among EU member countries would increase. Such expectations were due partly to a perceived reversal of the post-Second World War growth in intra-industry trade (IIT). Finds that average IIT levels continued to rise during the implementation of the single market. It is argued that the concept of marginal IIT(MIIT) is of greater relevance to adjustment than “static” IIT. Some evidence is shown to support this proposition, and a comprehensive set of intra-EU MIIT indices is calculated for the 1980 s. Since average MIIT levels in the 1988 - 92 period were higher than in the early 1980 s, this analysis also supports the conclusion that, on <b>average,</b> <b>adjustment</b> to the single market was no more disruptive than that experienced during earlier stages of European integration.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to an {{analysis}} of financial ratio adjustment in European financial statements. To that end, we use an hierarchical model based on the partial adjustment model. This model allows us to distinguish between adjustments that are due to external shocks and which affect all countries, on the one hand, and those resulting from internal shocks which affect the relative position of one country with respect to the rest, on the other. In addition to estimating the <b>average</b> <b>adjustment</b> coefficients of each ratio, we locate those countries that have a behaviour which is significantly different from the rest. We find that, in general, the evolution of the ratios analysed is mainly determined by their adjustments to external shocks, with the ratios related to the profit and loss account demonstrating a greater sensitivity to all types of shocks. By contrast, the debt ratios show the least sensitivity. When considered on a country-by-country basis, the most significant differences appear in the results ratios, with Spain being the country that is most sensitive to external shocks, and Denmark and Germany being least sensitive to all types of shocks. ...|$|E

Minimum-cost feedback schemes based on simple, but practically interesting, models for disturbances and dynamics have been discussed in several particular cases. The more general situation in which there may be measurement and adjustment errors, deterministic process drift, and costs of taking an observation, of making an adjustment, and of being off target, is considered in this article.

The models incorporated state-dependent white noise and moving <b>average</b> <b>adjustment</b> for filtering, with maximum likelihood parameter estimates obtained using an EM (expectation-maximisation) based iteration. Adjustment for filtering was included as it could be expected that the electronic filter used in recording would have a major effect on obviously brief intermediate conductance level sojourns. Preliminary data analysis revealed that the brevity of intermediate level sojourns caused difficulties in assignment of data points to levels as a result of over-estimation of noise variances. When reasonable constraints were placed on these variances using the better determined noise variances for the closed and fully open levels, idealisation anomalies were eliminated. Nevertheless, simulations suggested that mean sojourn times for the intermediate levels were still considerably over-estimated, and that recording bandwidth was a major limitation; improved results were obtained with higher bandwidth data (10 kHz sampled at 25 kHz). The simplest model consistent with these data had four open conductance levels, intermediate levels being approximately 20 %, 51 % and 74 % of fully open. The mean lifetime at the fully open level was about 1 ms; estimates for the three intermediate levels were 5492 mu s, probably still over-estimates. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
