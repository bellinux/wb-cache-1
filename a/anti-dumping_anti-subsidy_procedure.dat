40|$|Traditionally the American steel {{industry}} {{is the most}} protected industrial sector in the USA and internationally {{it is the largest}} user of <b>anti-dumping</b> and <b>anti-subsidy</b> proceedings. At the end of 1994 a ruling from the GATT Panel settled the most recent trade dispute in the steel market. A number of the <b>anti-dumping</b> and <b>anti-subsidy</b> proceedings applied for by US integrated steel producers in 1992 remain in effect. The following paper outlines the latest trade dispute in the steel trade, beginning with an overview of the various rounds of protectionism to date, and seeks to analyse the background to and causes of the dispute...|$|R
40|$|This article proposes several {{amendments}} to the Anti-Dumping (AD) Agreement and the chapter on Countervailing Duties (CVD) of the Subsidies Agreement, drawing {{from the experience of}} the State of Israel in AD and CVD administration over more than a decade. In particular, the Article argues for the need for international regulation of the institutional settings of such administration within Member States. To this end, provisions should be added to the relevant WTO agreements that relate to the nature and composition of the national administering authorities, with the guiding principle being to ensure independence of the authorities and objectivity, fairness and transparency of their investigations and determinations. International Law must try to guarantee that these authorities are immune to political pressures from interested parties. We suggest that the authority in these matters be transferred to independent, quasi-judicial bodies, as opposed to administrative agencies that are part of government ministries or controlled by them or by political organs. We argue, based on reason, as well as on evidence from several countries, that such bodies are more likely to produce balanced decisions, taking into account interests of both domestic industry and consumers, and also show that there are precedents within existing WTO law of such institutional regulation. We then proceeded to discuss amendments of the substantive law, particularly in relation to the definition of dumping. Here we propose granting clear priority to the establishment of normal value on the basis of actual sales by the foreign producer in his home market, and to restrict the use of the other options offered by the AD Agreement. To this end, we suggest, inter alia, to abolish or restrict the use of the methodology that allows sales made at prices below per unit (fixed and variable) costs of production to be treated as not being “in the ordinary course of trade” by reason of price and therefore disregarded in determining normal value. With respect to the assessment of AD and CV duties, we recommend to require compliance with the “Lesser Duty Rule”. We present statistical data from Israel, which shows the significant influence that the application of this Rule has had on the rate of AD duties in Israel. We further recommended the adoption of the Israeli methodology on how to apply the Rule, namely to generally base the calculation upon the price undercutting rate, and not on a target price. In {{view of the fact that}} <b>anti-dumping</b> and <b>anti-subsidy</b> <b>procedures</b> and measures are on the rise, and that more and more countries adopt such procedures based on the WTO Anti-Dumping and Subsidies Agreements, it is exceedingly important that these agreements are amended so as to minimize the damage to international trade caused by their use, while at the same time preserving them as a safeguard measure that will allow continued multilateral trade liberalization. This article suggests some ways in which this could be achieved...|$|R

Regression of the manufacturing is put forward in developed countries for the increase of employment. On the other hand, countries actively cultivate new economic growth points and compete for strategic high ground. Then the trade protectionism is increasing. The export products of our country suffer the <b>anti-dumping</b> and <b>anti-subsidy</b> and the friction has spread to the high technology fields. In reaction to this phenomenon, the reason would be analyzed in this paper, and the countermeasure and suggestion for the trade friction will be put forward. Therefore, the innovation ability need promote and the industrial transformation need realize. Meanwhile, a good environment for innovation need create and enterprises innovation need encourage...|$|R

In conclusion, based on the analysis of safeguard measures in the European Community's legal system and their practice in actual cases, it apparent that the European Community is making a serious effort to comply with the standards of the WTO Safeguards Agreement. In certain respects, the European Community has a comparatively higher level of standards than the WTO. Nevertheless, there continue to be challenges to WTO-compatibility in the European Community's safeguards, especially in terms of non-parallelism, the simultaneous imposition of a provisional safeguard measure at the initiation of a safeguard investigation, the vague meaning of regional safeguards, and so on...|$|R

These instruments empower the European Union to defend its traders against unfair trade of imported products or subsidized imports as well as against change in clear trade flows, if they are harmful to the EU economy. Economical legitimacy of <b>anti-dumping</b> and <b>anti-subsidy</b> trade defence actions is generally {{based on the fact}} that the international trade has no mechanism for correcting anti-competitive practice similar to the competition authorities that operate in almost all national economies.

30|$|As China’s PV {{and wind}} energy exports have grown rapidly, Chinese {{companies}} {{have become the}} victims of protectionism abroad. The USA launched an <b>anti-dumping</b> and <b>anti-subsidy</b> investigation into turbine equipment and PV products imported from China, causing huge losses to Chinese companies. The verdict against China has greatly hindered Chinese PV equipment exports to the USA. Following {{in the footsteps of}} the USA, the German Solar Energy Association planned to raise an anti-dumping case in 27 EU countries against China. Such protectionism practices suffocate China’s rapid growth in the new energy industry. China’s solar photovoltaic product exports dropped over the period from January to June 2012, after rapid growth for six consecutive years. The industry’s exports are now valued at US$ 12.894 billion, down YoY by 31.49  %. Leading enterprises such as Suntech, Jiangxi Saiwei, and Baoding Yingli endured huge export losses, while some others saw their share prices plummet in American stock markets. Those companies which performed the best in the past suffered the greatest losses.|$|R

40|$|Climate Change {{has found}} its way into the World Trade Organization through the {{backdoor}} of the profitable and contentious trade in solar and wind energy technologies. In addition to the Ontario FIT dispute critically examined in this article, there are at least five other active disputes in Geneva over aspects of trade in wind and solar technologies, with more on the horizon. Solar panels constitute a significant part of China’s total export sales in the EU and {{for more than two years}} its trade has overheated EU-China relations. The <b>anti-dumping</b> and <b>anti-subsidy</b> investigations that resulted have now culminated in a tentative settlement to bring Chinese solar panel prices to a “sustainable” level. Winds have been blowing more strongly on the other side of the Atlantic, though in a similar direction, where the US imposed record high rates of anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese (and Vietnamese) wind towers, as well as silicon solar panels. The political economy unfolding in both cases has been quite similar: on one side - claiming unfair trade allegedly committed by the Chinese exporters - are the import-competing manufacturers of Renewable Energy (`RE’) technology, and on the other side, the rest of the RE industry, particularly generators in whose interest it is to have access to the best and cheapest equipment, regardless of origin...|$|R
