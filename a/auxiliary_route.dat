5|$|SR104 is considered, by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>route</b> of US101, {{part of a}} {{numbering}} system established during the 1964 state highway renumbering. Every year, WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways {{in the state to}} measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 3,800 and 44,000 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly in the Shoreline area. The EdmondsKingston ferry carried 3.808 million passengers and 2.025 million vehicles in 2012, according to WSF statistics. The segments of the highway between Discovery Bay and Kingston and SR99 and I-5 in Edmonds and Shoreline are designated as part of the National Highway System, while the whole route is designated by WSDOT as a Highway of Statewide Significance because it connects major communities in the state of Washington.|$|E
5|$|The first {{segment of}} what later became I-94 within the state, the Willow Run Expressway, was built near Ypsilanti and Belleville in 1941, with an easterly {{extension}} to Detroit in 1945. This expressway was initially numbered M-112. In the mid-1950s, {{state and federal}} officials planned an Interstate to replace the original route of U.S. Highway12 (US12). By 1960, the length of I-94 was completed from Detroit to New Buffalo. Two years later, the US12 designation was dropped from the freeway. Subsequent extensions in the 1960s completed {{most of the rest of}} the route, including the remaining sections between Detroit and Port Huron which superseded the routing of US25. The last segment opened to the public in 1972 when Indiana completed its connection across the state line. Since completion, I-94 has remained relatively unchanged; a few interchanges have been rebuilt, a second span was constructed for the Blue Water Bridge, and in 1987, a plane crashed on the freeway during take off from the airport in Detroit. The routing of I-94 is notable for containing the first full freeway-to-freeway interchange in the United States, connecting to the Lodge Freeway (M-10), and for comprising the first complete border-to-border toll-free freeway in a state in the United States. The highway has one <b>auxiliary</b> <b>route,</b> I-194, which serves downtown Battle Creek, and eight business routes. Various segments have been dedicated to multiple people and places.|$|E

25|$|U.S. Route 101, {{despite its}} number, {{is not an}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>route,</b> but rather {{considered}} a primary U.S. route {{in its own right}} as major highway west of the former U.S. Route 99 on the west coast of the United States.|$|E

25|$|The Interstates in Hawaii, all {{located on}} the most populous island of Oahu, carry the prefix H. There are three one-digit routes in the state (H-1, H-2, and H-3) and one <b>auxiliary</b> <b>route</b> (H-201). These Interstates connect several {{military}} and naval bases together, {{as well as the}} important cities and towns spread across Oahu, and especially the metropolis of Honolulu.|$|E
25|$|The {{portion of}} the Thruway between Montezuma and the Rochester area is one of mostly rural nature, with the highway passing through remote, open fields, {{and for the most}} part {{avoiding}} highly populated areas. Along this stretch, it connects to two cities, both located well to the south of the Thruway: Geneva by way of exit42 for NY14 and Canandaigua by way of exit43 via NY21. The next exit along the highway, exit44 for NY332, also serves Canandaigua; the junction is the primary exit for Canandaigua-bound travelers from the Rochester area. Here, the Thruway temporarily widens from four to six lanes as it continues generally westward to meet I-490 at exit45 near Victor. Like in the vicinity of Schenectady and Utica, an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>route</b> of I-90—here I-490—directly serves a city (Rochester) while the Thruway bypasses it.|$|E

25|$|By 1933 the SH 20 {{designation}} {{was dropped}} over the Fredericksburg to Kerrville highway and extended instead over the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>route</b> SH 20A. That year {{the road was}} described between Fredericksburg and Hempstead as paved except for the portion in Hays County around Dripping Springs and a short portion west of Elgin that were described as surfaced. The portion west of Fredericksburg toward Junction was graded earth. In 1935, US 290 was routed over SH 20 except for the portion between Austin and Paige where US 290 was routed further south through Bastrop. By 1936, the formerly surfaced portion west of Elgin had been paved, but the Hays County portion remained merely surfaced. West of Fredericksburg, the Gillespie County portion had been surfaced while the Kimble County portion remained as an improved earth road. On September 26, 1939, the SH 20 designation was dropped along all portions of the route running along US 290 {{as a result of}} that year's general redescription of the state highway system leaving SH 20 as a greatly shortened route running from Austin to US 290 near Paige. On May 23, 1951, US 290 was relocated away from Bastrop northward along SH 20 which was then decommissioned.|$|E
500|$|MD 410 has {{one former}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>route.</b> MD 410A was the {{designation}} for the [...] portion of Belcrest Road between MD 500 and MD 410 in Hyattsville. The route was assigned by 1999. MD 410A {{was transferred to}} county maintenance in 2004.|$|E
