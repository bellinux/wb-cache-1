It was called [...] "The Match of the Century", and {{received}} front-page media {{coverage in the}} United States and around the world. Fischer's win was an American victory in a field that Soviet players had dominated for the previous quarter-century; players closely identified with, and subsidized by, the Soviet state. Kasparov remarked, [...] "Fischer fits ideologically into {{the context of the}} Cold War era: a lone American genius challenges the Soviet chess machine and defeats it". Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman calls Fischer's victory [...] "the story of a lonely hero who overcomes an entire empire".

500|$|Art historians {{gradually}} revised their {{dating from}} 1450 to the currently accepted 1435–40, {{earlier in the}} artist's career. This estimate is based on three factors; the dating of the Rolin Madonna, van der Weyden's opportunity of viewing that panel, {{and his ability to}} produce his own work after such a viewing. He is known to have visited Brussels– where van Eyck kept his studio– [...] in 1432 and again 1435. Erwin Panofsky suggested c. 1434 as the earliest possible date, and that the Rolin panel was completed in 1433 or 1434. Julius Held was sceptical of this early dating, noting that if true we are [...] "forced to assume that within one year of Jan's work Rogier received a commission which gave him an opportunity to adopt Jan's compositional pattern while subjecting {{it at the same time}} to a very thorough and highly personal transformation, and <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> Bruges, under Jan's very eyes".|$|E

Brown, seeing <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> silhouette on the shade, rushes to Bianca's assistance. He finds her reading peacefully, and is told that the incident must have been an hallucination of his own brain. A few evenings after this Bianca actually is attacked by a burglar.

500|$|Althorp {{house is}} {{described}} as standing in a low situation, [...] "approached by a handsome avenue, beautifully shaded with trees". The house was originally a [...] "classically beautiful" [...] red brick Tudor building, and a Johannes Vorstermans painting dated to 1677 shows a smaller red house at Althorp and Holdenby House in {{the distance to the}} far right. Cosmo III noted that the interior of Althorp house was strongly influenced by Italian architecture, and remarked that it [...] "may be said to be the best planned, and best arranged country seat in the kingdom; for though there may be many which surpass it in size, none are superior to it in symmetrical elegance". The current building dates to 1688. Diarist John Evelyn described it that year: [...] "The house, or rather palace, at Althorpe is a noble uniform pile in form of a half H, built of brick and freestone 'a la moderne'; the hall is well, the staircase excellent; the rooms of state, galleries, offices, and furniture, such as may become a great prince. It is situate {{in the midst of a}} garden, exquisitely planned and kept and <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> a park walled in with hewn stone, planted with rows and walks of trees, canals and fishponds and stored with game." [...] Its appearance was radically altered in the 18th century when the architect Henry Holland was commissioned to make extensive changes starting in 1788. Mathematical tiles were added to the exterior, brought from Ipswich, encasing the old red brick, and four Corinthian pilasters, made from Roche Abbey stone in Yorkshire, were added to the front. The stone used to make the pilasters was reportedly intended by Christopher Wren to be used in the construction of St Paul's Cathedral. Sash windows with glazing bars and [...] "moulded stone ...|$|E

In his autobiography Mansell stated that when Chapman died, [...] "The bottom dropped out of my world. Part of me died with him. I had lost a member of my family". Following Chapman's death, relationships at Lotus became strained, as replacement team principal Peter Warr did not have a high regard for him as a driver or person. Warr in his book titled Team Lotus – My View From The Pit Wall stated about the 1982 season, [...] "After carefully analysing the season just finished, it was completely clear who was the number one.

2500|$|During the British rule, the Sepoy Mutiny (also {{called the}} First War of Independence (the Uprising) was put down in 1857 {{and the last}} Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar II was taken {{prisoner}} at Humayun tomb. This fort was then the scene of lot of war activity. During the Upraising, Emperor Bahadur Shah II‘s complicity with the mutinous soldiers was obvious. He operated from this Fort. During August and early September 1857 he held meetings at the fort on war strategy. He also watched, from the ramparts of the fort, artillery fire aimed at the British Army. He even played a psychological game with his army officers who had come in a delegation seeking salary, when {{he told them that}} he would forego some of his crown jewels for the purpose and that he would give up his life for the cause; the officers refused his offer trusting that the Emperor was stating <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> right earnest. Following this, even proclamations were issued declaring that the Emperor would lead the attack against the British and urging all his people, irrespective of caste or creed, to join him in fighting the war. But, in the middle of September 1857, British soldiers were closing in on the Fort. At this stage, his trusted assistant Bhakt Khan urged the Emperor to leave the fort and accompany him to a safer place and look for a day when he could [...] "renew war in the open country". But the Emperor refused, permitted his army to vacate the fort but he himself moved to the Humayun tomb. The fourth infantry of the British army entered the Salimgarh Fort where they encountered a single sentry only. Similar experience was encountered by the Punjab Fourth infantry regiment when, earlier, they had entered the Palace from the Lahore gate of the Red Fort.|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, Crews {{joined the}} UC Berkeley English Department, where he taught for 36 years before {{retiring}} as its chair in 1994. Crews was an anti-war activist from 1965 to about 1970 and advocated draft resistance as co-chair of Berkeley’s Faculty Peace Committee. Though he shared the widespread assumption during the mid-1960s that psychoanalytic theory was a valid account of human motivation {{and was one}} of the first academics to apply that theory systematically to the study of literature, Crews gradually came to regard psychoanalysis as a pseudoscience. This convinced him that his loyalty should not belong to any theory but rather to empirical standards and the skeptical point of view. Throughout his career, Crews has brought his concern for rational discourse to the study of various issues, from the controversy over recovered memory, the credibility of the Rorschach test, and belief in alien abductions to the Theosophical Society, creationism, and “intelligent design.” He has also advocated for clear writing based on standards of sound argument and rhetorical effectiveness rather than adherence to rigid school-book rules. “What interests me is general rationality,” said Crews,General rationality requires us to observe the world carefully, to consider alternative hypotheses to our own hypotheses, to gather evidence in a responsible way, to answer objections. These are habits of mind that science shares with good history, good sociology, good political science, good economics, what have you. And I summarize <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> what I call the [...] "empirical attitude." [...] It's a combination of feeling responsible to the evidence that is available, feeling responsible to go out and find that evidence, including the evidence that is contrary to one's presumptions, and responsibility to be logical with one's self and others. And this is an ideal that is not so much individual as social. The rational attitude doesn't really work when simply applied to one's self. It is something that we owe to each other.|$|E
