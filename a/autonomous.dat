5|$|During the 1930s, {{as part of}} the {{changing}} Soviet policy towards its ethnic territories, a decision was made to increase the proportion of ethnic Russians in the <b>autonomous</b> oblast. On April10, 1936, the predominantly Russian city of Maykop, as well as Giaginsky District and Khansky Selsoviet of Maykopsky District, became a part of the <b>autonomous</b> oblast (with the selsoviet having been incorporated into Giaginsky District). At the same time, the administrative center of the <b>autonomous</b> oblast was moved from Krasnodar to Maykop. Tuapse, a port on the Black Sea, was considered for the role of the administrative center, but the idea was rejected as it would give the native population access to the sea.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s {{and early}} 2000s, several city councils and <b>autonomous</b> {{communities}} had opened registers for civil unions that allowed benefits for unmarried couples of any sex, although {{the effect was}} mainly symbolic. Registries were created in 16 out of 17 of Spain's <b>autonomous</b> communities; Catalonia (1998), Aragon (1999), Navarre (2000), Castile-La Mancha (2000), Valencia (2001), Balearic Islands (2001), Madrid (2001), Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002), Castile and León (2002), Extremadura (2003), Basque Country (2003), Canary Islands (2003), Cantabria (2005), Galicia (2008) and La Rioja (2010), and in both <b>autonomous</b> cities; Ceuta (1998) and Melilla (2008) Spanish law already allowed single people to adopt children; thus, a same-sex couple could undertake a de facto adoption, but the partner who was not the legal parent had no rights if the relationship ended or the legal parent died. Same-sex marriages were not legal in the <b>autonomous</b> communities, because the Spanish Constitution gives the State sole power to legislate marriage.|$|E

5|$|On June2, 1924, when Kuban-Black Sea Oblast was abolished, the <b>autonomous</b> oblast {{was first}} subordinated to South-Eastern Krai and later, on October16, 1924, to North Caucasus Krai. No other {{significant}} changes occurred until February7, 1929, when the five districts were re-organized into three (Krasnogvardeysky, Psekupsky, and Shovgenovsky). When North Caucasus Krai was split on January10, 1934, Adyghe <b>Autonomous</b> Oblast was subordinated {{to the newly}} created Azov-Black Sea Krai. On December28, 1934, the three districts of the <b>autonomous</b> oblast were once again re-organized into five (Koshekhablsky, Krasnogvardeysky, Ponezhukaysky, Shovgenovsky, and Takhtamukaysky), due to the directive to downsize the districts in Azov-Black Sea Krai.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{mission to}} move a {{metallic}} disc {{from one side of}} an arena to another with a completely <b>autonomous</b> flying robot was seen by many as almost impossible. The college teams continued to improve their entries {{over the next two years}} when the competition saw its first <b>autonomous</b> takeoff, flight, and landing by a team from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Three years later in 1995 a team from Stanford University was able to acquire a single disk and move it from one side of the arena to the other in a fully <b>autonomous</b> flight—half a decade earlier than some pundits had predicted.|$|E

5|$|This list of <b>autonomous</b> areas {{arranged}} by country gives {{an overview of}} <b>autonomous</b> areas of the world. An <b>autonomous</b> area is defined as an area {{of a country that}} has a degree of autonomy, or has freedom from an external authority. It is typical for it to be geographically distant from the country, or to be populated by a national minority. Countries that include <b>autonomous</b> areas are often federacies. The <b>autonomous</b> areas differ from federal units and independent states in the sense that they, in relation to the majority of other sub-national territories in the same country, enjoy a special status including some legislative powers, within the state (for a detailed list of federated units, see Federated state#List of federal units by federation).|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the other}} onboard instruments, the {{operation}} of the cameras for visible light is not <b>autonomous,</b> but rather it is controlled by an imaging parameter table contained in one of the on-board digital computers, the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS). Since the 1990s, space probes usually have completely <b>autonomous</b> cameras.|$|E

5|$|Mancera {{has worked}} as {{candidate}} attorney, lawyer, and adviser at several law firms, including García Cordero y Asociados and Grupo de Abogados Consultores. Mancera has been a professor at several universities of Mexico, including the UNAM, <b>Autonomous</b> Technological Institute of Mexico, University of the Valley of Mexico, Panamerican University, <b>Autonomous</b> University of Aguascalientes, and <b>Autonomous</b> University of Baja California. In 2002, Mancera was a review committee member of the Criminal Procedure Code for the Federal District, and around the same time, he began working in government after Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico City's Secretary of Public Security, invited him to be his adviser. After Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the mayor of Mexico City, named Ebrard as Social Development Secretary of the city, Mancera was assigned Legal Director of the Social Development Secretariat. In 2006, Mancera was named Assistant Attorney General of Mexico City.|$|E

In addition, there are several Iraq, Georgia, Bulgaria, the Republic of Macedonia, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and western Mongolia.|$|E
25|$|Ambient {{intelligence}} and <b>autonomous</b> control {{are not part}} of the original concept of the Internet of things. Ambient {{intelligence and}} <b>autonomous</b> control do not necessarily require Internet structures, either. However, there is a shift in research to integrate the concepts of the Internet of things and <b>autonomous</b> control, with initial outcomes towards this direction considering objects as the driving force for <b>autonomous</b> IoT.|$|E

25|$|Madeira: {{possession}} (1418–1420); colony (1420–1580); crown colony (1580–1834); <b>autonomous</b> district (1834–1976). Made an <b>autonomous</b> {{region in}} 1976.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, a new Serbian Constitution {{was enacted}} that drastically reduced {{the powers of}} the <b>autonomous</b> provinces, reserving many formerly <b>autonomous</b> rights to the central authorities in Belgrade. It also changed back the name of Kosovo from the Socialist <b>Autonomous</b> Province of Kosovo to the <b>Autonomous</b> Province of Kosovo and Metohija, returning the province to the status predating the 1970s and using the Serbian name for {{the western part of the}} region.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{the various}} health {{services}} {{fall under the}} responsibility of the respective <b>autonomous</b> communities, but also under basic direction and coordination by the central state.

25|$|Azores: colonies (1427–1766); captaincy-general (1766–1831); <b>autonomous</b> {{districts of}} Angra do Heroismo, Horta and Ponta Delgada (1831–1976). Made an <b>autonomous</b> region in 1976.|$|E
25|$|Mining robots are {{designed}} to solve {{a number of problems}} currently facing the mining industry, including skills shortages, improving productivity from declining ore grades, and achieving environmental targets. Due to the hazardous nature of mining, in particular underground mining, the prevalence of <b>autonomous,</b> semi-autonomous, and tele-operated robots has greatly increased in recent times. A number of vehicle manufacturers provide <b>autonomous</b> trains, trucks and loaders that will load material, transport it on the mine site to its destination, and unload without requiring human intervention. One of the world's largest mining corporations, Rio Tinto, has recently expanded its <b>autonomous</b> truck fleet to the world's largest, consisting of 150 <b>autonomous</b> Komatsu trucks, operating in Western Australia. Similarly, BHP has announced the expansion of its <b>autonomous</b> drill fleet to the world's largest, 21 <b>autonomous</b> Atlas Copco drills.|$|E
25|$|<b>Autonomous</b> public {{utilities}} are typically affiliated {{to the local}} corporation in their governorate. They are cost centers within the LC. For example, the <b>autonomous</b> utility in Bait al-Faqih reports to the local corporation in Hodeidah, and the <b>autonomous</b> utility in Rada'a, where the reform process had been piloted, reports to the local corporation in Al/Bayda'. Two of the 15 <b>autonomous</b> utilities are still affiliated to NWSA. These two utilities—in Ataq, the capital of Shabwah Governorate, and in Al Mahwit—are located in governorates {{where there is no}} local corporation yet. They are in an intermediate state before becoming LCs. The Rada’a Principles apply to all <b>autonomous</b> {{public utilities}}.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Autonomous</b> Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) is an <b>autonomous</b> region. Unlike other {{administrative}} regions, <b>autonomous</b> regions {{have additional}} political power, {{and have a}} regional governor and assembly. In addition, the constitution allows {{for the creation of}} <b>autonomous</b> region in the Cordillera Central. However, only the ARMM has been approved by voters in a plebiscite. Voters in the Cordilleras have rejected autonomy in 1990 and 1998; hence the Cordillera Administrative Region remains as a regular administrative region with no added powers or officials.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the newer}} {{application}} areas is <b>autonomous</b> vehicles, which include submersibles, land-based vehicles (small robots with wheels, cars or trucks), aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The level of autonomy ranges from fully <b>autonomous</b> (unmanned) vehicles to vehicles where computer vision based systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully <b>autonomous</b> vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, i.e. for knowing where it is, or for producing a map of its environment (SLAM) and for detecting obstacles. It {{can also be used}} for detecting certain task specific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars, and systems for <b>autonomous</b> landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for <b>autonomous</b> driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military <b>autonomous</b> vehicles ranging from advanced missiles, to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with <b>autonomous</b> vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Mars Exploration Rover and ESA's ExoMars Rover.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish State is {{integrated}} by 17 <b>autonomous</b> communities and 2 <b>autonomous</b> cities, both groups being the highest or first-order administrative {{division in the}} country. <b>Autonomous</b> communities are integrated by provinces, {{of which there are}} 50 in total, and in turn, provinces are integrated by municipalities. In Catalonia, two additional divisions exist, the comarques (sing. comarca) and the vegueries (sing. vegueria) both of which have administrative powers; comarques being aggregations of municipalities, and the vegueries being aggregations of comarques. The concept of a comarca exists in all <b>autonomous</b> communities, however, unlike Catalonia, these are merely historical or geographical subdivisions.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Proton has {{announced}} their partnership with LG Electronics {{in the development}} of <b>autonomous</b> safety technology. In September 2014, Proton previewed an Iriz prototype with LG's Advanced Drive Assistance System (ADAS). With the LG ADAS implementation, new <b>autonomous</b> safety features like <b>Autonomous</b> Emergency Braking (AEB), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Cross Traffic Assist (CTA), Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) and High Beam Assist (HBA) can be incorporated into Proton's future offerings. The inclusion of <b>autonomous</b> safety features has become a necessary prerequisite for a full 5-Star Euro NCAP and ANCAP rating.|$|E
25|$|Spain {{is divided}} into 17 <b>autonomous</b> communities, which in turn are divided into 50 {{province}}s. There are also two <b>autonomous</b> cities: those of Ceuta and Melilla. Finally, each province comprises a number of municipalities.|$|E
25|$|Khanty and Mansi peoples live in Khanty–Mansi <b>Autonomous</b> Okrug of Russia. Komi {{subgroup}} Komi-Permyaks {{used to live}} in Komi-Permyak <b>Autonomous</b> Okrug, {{but today}} this area is a territory with special status within Perm Krai.|$|E
25|$|The urban {{units have}} an <b>autonomous</b> city, municipal, or town council and are {{subdivided}} into wards and mtaa. The non-urban units have an <b>autonomous</b> district council but are subdivided into village councils or township authorities (first level) {{and then into}} vitongoji.|$|E
