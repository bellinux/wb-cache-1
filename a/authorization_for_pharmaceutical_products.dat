40|$|This paper investigates how {{regulation}} {{impinged on}} the launch strategies of international <b>pharmaceutical</b> corporations <b>for</b> new molecules across the main OECD markets between 1960 – 2008. Comprehensive IMS data {{is used to}} analyze the international diffusion of 845 molecules from 14 different anatomic therapeutic categories using non-parametric survival analysis. The paper focuses on two main regulatory changes that substantially reshaped the barriers to entry: the U. S. Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, and the establishment of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 1995. We find that legal transaction costs {{have a significant impact on}} timing of launch. Stringent market <b>authorization</b> requirements <b>for</b> new <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products</b> in the United States after 1962 resulted in a significant U. S. drug lag in the introduction of pharmaceutical innovation vis-à-vis Europe from 1960 – 1984. However, financial incentives stemming from the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act proved effective in closing this lag. A more streamlined EMA regulatory approval process has reduced barriers to entry in Europe, thereby enabling quicker diffusion of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products,</b> yet a marked pattern of delay in the adoption of innovation is still evident due to local differences in pricing regulations. Any new molecule launch strategically takes place first in higher-priced European Union (EU) markets as a result of the threat of arbitrage and price dependency across EU Member States...|$|R

40|$|This comment will {{demonstrate}} how discrepancies among product li- ability standards and different interpretations of their application have cre- ated fear and {{uncertainty in the}} pharmaceutical industry. This fear has caused distortions in the market, increased costs for both manufacturers and consumers, and chilled {{the research and development}} of new products. To combat these problems, this comment proposes that the United States, the European Union, and Japan work together to create a new international, uniform system of <b>product</b> liability <b>for</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products.</b> Harmo- nizing the standard of liability <b>for</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> among these regimes has proven inadequate to stop inconsistency and uncertainty. This comment proposes the creation of an International Drug Administration (IDA), com- prised of members from different countries that would serve as an interna- tional regulatory agency promulgating registration and development requirements for new drugs on the international market. A special subset of the IDA would serve as an administrative tribunal for liability cases. The IDA tribunal would provide a uniform system of product liability, compen- sating consumers for injury but not punishing manufacturers without fault. Part II of this comment will introduce the current liability standards <b>for</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products</b> in the United States, the European Union, and Ja- pan, and will explain how these standards developed and how they differ from each other. Part I will then illustrate how these differences translate into uncertainty and how that uncertainty negatively affects the pharmaceu- tical market. Part IV will introduce the concept of international regulation of the pharmaceutical industry through an IDA. Finally, Part V will explain how this IDA would act as an administrative tribunal <b>for</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>product</b> liability claims. This system would eliminate inconsistency and uncertainty in product liability and provide a better, more uniform system of <b>product</b> liability <b>for</b> the <b>pharmaceutical</b> industry...|$|R

30|$|Existing {{inventory}} {{models for}} multi-customers {{are not applicable}} to <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products</b> <b>for</b> several reasons. <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>products</b> can be more expensive than other products to purchase and distribute, and shortages and improper use of essential medicines can have a high cost in terms of wasted resources and preventable diseases and death. Therefore, special care should be taken in pharmaceutical inventory decisions to ensure 100 % product availability at the right time, at the right cost, and in good condition to the right customers. The quality of health care industries strongly depends {{on the availability of}} pharmaceuticals on time. If a shortage occurs at a hospital, an emergency delivery is necessary, which is very costly and can affect the patient health. Inventory management strategies that are unsuitable for health care industries may lead to large financial losses and a significant impact on patients. Hence, inventory strategies <b>for</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products</b> are more critical than those for other products. Thus, a specific inventory model is necessary to control <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products,</b> to save patient lives and reduce unnecessary inventory costs.|$|R
