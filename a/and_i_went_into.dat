500|$|For me, I {{was a new}} {{actor to}} Los Angeles, didn’t know the TV {{business}} very well so I was just excited to work and play a vampire. I had no clue what I {{was going to do}} or how I was going to be scary. Until that is, they put the vampire makeup on me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the trailer and smiled, which I thought was creepy. Joss always said he was intrigued that someone who looked like me and talked like me was like the scariest vampire ever. That's what he wanted, my sweet voice and demeanour until all of a sudden I'm just this vicious vampire." ...|$|E

The BBC {{announced that it}} would not broadcast [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] due to the line [...] "I'd love to turn you on", which, according to the corporation, advocated drug use. Other lyrics allegedly referring to drugs include [...] "found my way upstairs and had a smoke / somebody spoke <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> a dream". A spokesman for the BBC stated: [...] "We have listened to this song over and over again.

Stewart also added: [...] "We always knew that the records we created were special [...] at the time it was more contractual obligation , I can only have so many songs produced by me on the album, and she honestly didn't need any more records, as you can tell by the success of this album, the songs have been flawless." [...] The producer later revealed one of the songs was titled [...] "Dressing Up", saying: [...] "This song is really special. It's called 'Dressing Up,' so it's going to be a big record, I think, it definitely fits. It's right there in what her sensibilities are as a musician and a songwriter. She doesn't change much. She has a very keen musical taste. It'll be really good".|$|E
