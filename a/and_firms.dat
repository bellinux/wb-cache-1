The Board of Regents accepted the society's offer, and a formal transfer of the Romney Classical Institute's former campus was made. The society discovered that, in order to make good on its promise, it had to raise more than $1,000, a close to impossible task during the Reconstruction Era in Romney. Following a resolution on July 11, 1870, to raise between $1,200 and $1,300, a subscription of $1,383.60 was raised after 118 individuals <b>and</b> <b>firms</b> donated the needed funds, and shortly thereafter the formal transfer of the property was completed.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} working capital efficiency <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> profitability, <b>and</b> how this relationship is affected by economic fluctuations. In the existing literature, the relationship between working capital efficiency <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> profitability has been extensively researched. However, the impact of economic fluctuations {{on the relationship between}} working capital efficiency <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> profitability is sparsely researched. To the best of our knowledge, only Enqvist, Graham and Nikkinen (2014) have addressed the impact ofeconomic fluctuations on the relationship between working capital efficiency <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> profitability. This thesis is a replication of their study in another geographical setting, another time period and studying different types of firms. Using a sample of 2, 589 firm-year observations of listed Swedish firms for the years 2000 - 2015, this thesis conducts multiple regression analysis {{to examine the relationship between}} working capital efficiency <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> profitability. The findings of this thesis propose that firms can enhance profitability by improving their working capital efficiency. However, the relationship between working capital efficiency <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> profitability does not appear to be significantly affected by economic fluctuations. This thesis contributes to the existing literature by further strengthening the understanding of the relationship between working capital efficiency <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> profitability. In addition, it also adds to the existing literature on the relationship between working capital efficiency <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> profitability in a Swedish context...|$|R

Based on widely existing literature that studied the relationship between corporate governance <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> performance, studies that investigated the role of executive committee with firm performance {{are few and far}} between and hence, the main aim of this study is to discover this relation.
