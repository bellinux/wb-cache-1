5000|$|As octocorals, {{sea pens}} are colonial animals with {{multiple}} polyps (which look somewhat like miniature sea anemones), each with eight tentacles. Unlike other octocorals, however, a sea pen's polyps are specialized to specific functions: a single polyp develops into a rigid, erect stalk (the rachis) and loses its tentacles, forming a bulbous [...] "root" [...] or peduncle at its base. The other polyps branch out from this central stalk, forming water intake structures (siphonozooids), feeding structures (autozooids) with nematocysts, and reproductive structures. The entire colony is fortified by calcium carbonate {{in the form}} of spicules and a central <b>axial</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
50|$|G. mariae is the {{smallest}} sea fan in the Caribbean, growing to a height of about 30 cm. The much branched structure is mostly two dimensional, and as it enlarges, the branches become cross-connected to form a net. The branches are only slightly compressed and the side branches are pinnately divided. The colour varies, most specimens are whitish and others are yellow, and there is often some violet colour near the base. Two other growth forms exist in the Caribbean; one has many short, free branches on one or both faces of the net; the other, which is usually bright yellow, has {{the lower part of}} the colony anastomising and net-like, while the upper and outer parts have free branches. The supporting <b>axial</b> <b>rod</b> in the main stem and branches is formed of gorgonin, calcified to some extent, a flexible and almost unbreakable material. This enables the gorgonian to brace itself and sway with the current so that the polyps can expand to feed.|$|E
50|$|Rugose corals always show tabulae, {{horizontal}} plates {{that divide}} the corallite skeleton. The corallites are usually large relative to {{different types of}} coral. Rugose corals will sometimes have dissepiments, which are curved plates connected to septa and tabulae. The symmetry can be distinguished by the orientation of septa in a transverse section of the coral. Rugose corals always display bilateral symmetry whereas tabulate and scleractinian corals show radial symmetry. Initially there are only 4 major septa; later minor septa are added in the 4 resulting spaces. The complex arrangement of septa is diagnostic of rugose corals. Rugose corals will also always have a columella, an <b>axial</b> <b>rod</b> which supports the septa running up {{the center of the}} corallite. It is present in rugose corals because they were mainly solitary and so required the extra support. Tabulate corals have no columella because they were always colonial and relied on the support of neighboring corallites.|$|E

The mechanical structure comprises an iron yoke {{surrounded by a}} 20 mm thick aluminium alloy shell, and includes four loading pads that transmit the required pre-compression from the outer shell into the two coils. The outer shell is pre-tensioned with mechanical keys that are inserted {{with the help of}} pressurized bladders and two 30 mm diameter aluminium alloy <b>rods</b> provide the <b>axial</b> loading to the coil ends.

40|$|The later {{morphogenesis}} of the acrosome of Limnodriloides winckelmanni and Rhyacodrilus arthingtonae {{is compared}} with that in Enchytraeus and in earthworms. After superposition of the acrosome {{on the tip of}} the nucleus the manchette continues apically beyond the nucleus to ensheath the acrosomal tube.

40|$|Two {{finite element}} {{procedures}} are described for predicting the dynamic response of general 3 -D fluid-filled elastic piping systems. The first approach, a low frequency procedure, models each straight pipe or elbow as {{a sequence of}} beams. The contained fluid is modeled as a separate coincident sequence <b>axial</b> members (<b>rods)</b> which {{are tied to the}} pipe in the lateral direction. The model includes the pipe hoop strain correction to the fluid sound speed and the flexibility factor correction to the elbow flexibility. The second modeling approach, an intermediate frequency procedure, follows generally the original Zienkiewicz-Newton scheme for coupled fluid-structure problems except that the velocity potential is used as the fundamental fluid unknown to symmetrize the coefficient matrices. From comparisons of the beam model predictions to both experimental data and the 3 -D model, the beam model is validated for frequencies up to about two-thirds of the lowest fluid-filled labor pipe mode.

40|$|The most {{limiting}} {{design criteria}} for nuclear reactor normal operating conditions (ANS Condition I) {{are known to}} be rod internal pressure and cladding oxidation, while those for nuclear reactor transient operating conditions (ANS Conditon II) to be fuel centerline temperature and transient cladding total tensile strain. However, the design margins against fuel temperature and transient cladding tensile strain become smaller since power uprating is being or will be utilized for the most of nuclear power reactors to enhance the economics of nuclear power. In order to secure sufficient design margins against fuel temperature and cladding total tensile strain even for power uprating, the current <b>axial</b> <b>rod</b> power profiles used in the reactor transient analysis were optimized to reduce over-conservatism, considering that 118 % overpower of a steady-state peak rod average power was not exceeded during the reactor transients.

40|$|Ultrastructural {{analyses}} of bivalve spermatozoa are relevant in studies that aim to identify taxonomic traits {{for the purposes}} of discriminating species and conducting phylogenetic studies. In the present work, spermatozoa of mussel specimens of the genus Mytella, collected from two populations living in distinct habitats, were examined by electron microscopy. The objective was to identify sperm ultrastructural taxonomic traits {{that could be used to}} differentiate Mytella species. The specimens were from populations that live in intertidal zones on the southeast coast of Brazil, either buried in muddy-sand sediment or anchored to rocky substrates. The acrosomal vesicle was conical and long, the <b>axial</b> <b>rod</b> extended from the nucleus to the acrosome, the nucleus was an oblate spheroid with a condensed chromatin, the intermediate portion contained mitochondria encircling a pair of centrioles, and there was a single flagellum. The sperm was of a primitive type. The spermatozoon ultrastructure did not distinguish the specimens buried in muddy-sand sediment from those anchored to rocky substrates. The data suggest that the specimens analyzed, despite living in distinct habitats, belong to the same species, which conchological analyses identified as M. charruana.

40|$|Plesiomorph {{characters}} for the oligochaete spermatozoon are proposed. The chief trends {{from these}} plesiomorphies have been elongation of the acrosome and its tube; {{withdrawal of the}} primary acrosome vesicle and the <b>axial</b> <b>rod</b> into the acrosome tube and development of a capitulum; development of connectives, from the secondary tube to the <b>axial</b> <b>rod</b> (though there is some possibility that the reverse, absence of connectives, is plesiomorph); detorting and shortening of the midpiece (or possibly, again, the reverse) {{with an increase in}} numbers of mitochrondria from the plesiomorph four to eight; modification of the base of the tube to form a limen of variable form; and, in one line (lumbricids) flattening of the tip of the nucleus and correspondingly of the limen. Sperm ultrastructure, examined for 9 oligochaete families, corresponds well with taxonomic and phylogenetic groupings recently recognized by the author. However, convergent similarity of the phreodrilid sperm to that of the Lumbricina suggests a corresponding alteration of fertilization biology in the phreodrilids. The results indicate that the Haplotaxidae lie {{at the base of the}} opisthopores, though they do not unequivocally contraindicate acceptance of a Haplotaxis-like form as a stem form of the Haplotaxida (opisthopores and Haplotaxidae) and Tubificida.

The goal {{of this study was to}} establish the most ergonomic table height for the particular physique of the surgeon and the different types of laparoscopic instrument handles that he or she uses. Methods: In a simulated model, two probands of different stature (50 th {BS 50 } and 95 th {BS 95 } percentile) used laparoscopic instruments with four different handle designs (shank, pistol, <b>axial,</b> and <b>rod).</b> The instruments were inserted into a board in three different angles ({IA} = 20 °, 30 °, 40 °).

Histopathological examination revealed extensive granulomatous inflammation within the dermis and subcutaneous fascial plane between the fat and <b>axial</b> musculature. Acid-fast <b>rods</b> were detected within the smallest lesions, which were presumably the ones that had developed earliest. Eventually, after several months of incubation at room temperature, a very slowly growing acid-fast organism was isolated. Sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene identified it as a Mycobacterium species closely related (0. 59 % divergence) to M. triplex, an SAV mycobacterium. Intradermal inoculation of healthy green moray eels with this organism reliably reproduced the lesion. Experimentally induced granulomatous dermatitis appeared within 2 weeks of inoculation and slowly but progressively expanded during the 2 months of the experiment.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{spermiogenesis}} of Mytilus edulis (a marine mussel) {{has been}} studied, employing techniques {{of light and}} electron microscopy and cytochemical preparations. The observations trace {{the development of the}} acrosomal complex, the nucleus, the mitochondrial middle-piece, and the flagellum. In early spermatids numerous membrane-bounded proacrosomal vesicles arise from several Golgi complexes and coalesce to form a single large acrosomal vesicle. This comes to rest on the anterior surface of the nucleus and invaginates to become an elongated cone-shaped structure. An electron dense, spherical mass of membranoid sleeve material, also arising from the Golgi complex, adjoins the acrosomal vesicle and later occupies its indentation. In mature spermatozoa the membranoid sleeve lines the cavity of the cone-shaped acrosomal vesicle and surrounds the <b>axial</b> <b>rod.</b> Precursor material of the <b>axial</b> <b>rod</b> is first observed between the nucleus and the acrosomal vesicle as an aggregation of fibers. This later extends posteriorly into the nucleus and anteriorly into the cavity of the acrosomal vesicle. In the mature spermatozoon the fibrous <b>axial</b> <b>rod</b> ends posteriorly in the centriolar region of the middle-piece. The endoplasmic reticulum of early spermatids is a rudimentary system of membrane-bounded canaliculi and flattened vesicles which is predominantly free of ribosomes. Independent or clustered ribosome-like particles are present in the ground cytoplasm. By late spermiogenesis the reticulum has largely disappeared and the ground cytoplasm containing a dense particulate aggregate is sloughed off. In the early spermatid a dense filamentous network of chromatin in the interior and along the periphery of the nucleus increases in size by accretion of the finer karyoplasm. Eventually the interaggregate spaces are obliterated as the large, coarsely granular masses coalesce to form the compact, barrel-shaped nucleus of the sperm. By mid-spermiogenesis the randomly distributed elipsoid mitochondria become localized around the nucleus. The association with the nucleus is intimate and in many cases the mitochondria may be found in shallow recesses with the nuclear envelope reflected over their surface. Subsequently the mitochondria became spheroid, reduced to five in number, and restricted to the sperm middle-piece. Two cylindrical centrioles are situated near the base of the nucleus and are surrounded by the mitochondria of the middle-piece. The distal centriole elongates and from it the longitudinal fibrils of the sperm flagellum originate. The proximal centriole, oriented obliquely to the distal centriole, retains its initial structure. Tests with Sudan black B showed the presence of phospholipids in the mitochondria of late spermatids and mature sperm. Cytochemical techniques for carbohydrates indicated a neutral mucoprotein for the proacrosomal vesicles and allowed these to be identified in early spermatogenesis. The development of the Mytilus spermatid was compared with that of other vertebrate and invertebrate species...|$|E

The NESTOR experiment performed by CEA-EDF-EPRI provided accurate data for various variables (mean and RMS axial velocities, pressure drops, and rod inner-surface temperatures) for a 5 ? 5 PWR fuel rod assembly with and without complex split-type mixing vane grids (MVGs). This study investigates isolated CFD methodological factors for rod bundles with complex split-type MVGs under isothermal and single-phase heated prototypic PWR thermal hydraulic conditions. Examined CFD methodological factors include; mesh size, isotropic/anisotropic turbulence models, axial domain considerations, and conjugate heat transfer considerations for the single-phase heated problem. Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models were considered because of their practical feasibility in application to the real PWR fuel rod bundle. Under a high-quality mesh, results from isothermal steady calculations adopted steady RANS turbulence models with a wall function (high-y+ treatment) can produce; (i) accurate pressure losses across MVG and SSG spans, (ii) comparable mean axial velocity (MVG and simple support grid (SSG) spans), and (iii) comparable and RMS axial velocity fluctuation (MVG span) profiles with NESTOR experimental profiles for the MVG rod bundle with alternating SSGs in the downstream regions. Heated steady calculations over-predicted <b>axial</b> and azimuthal <b>rod</b> inner-surface temperature distributions at various axial elevations in the MVG and SSG span wake region...|$|R
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{studied the}} shape of dust grains grown in a cluster-cluster type of aggregation (CCA) and derived characteristic axial ratios to describe the nonsphericity. CCAs might be described by an axial ratio {{in the limit of}} large aggregates, where and describe the minimum and maximumr = r /r 2. 0 r rCCA g, max g, min g, min g, max radius of gyration, while small aggregates show a somewhat larger value in their mean axial ratio up to but rapidly decrease to the limit. The axial ratios for large aggregates are in agreementr 3. 0 r 2. 0 CCA CCA with the general findings of different authors for axial ratios of interstellar dust grains that are generally described by rods or spheroids. Beyond this kind of agreement, our approach does not necessarily require a special shape for individual dust grains but rather offers a physical process to generate nonsphericity. Although the simple shapes might be sufficient for first-order applications and are easier to handle analytically, our results offer a firm ground of special <b>axial</b> ratios for <b>rods</b> or spheroids on a more physical basis apart from any ad hoc assumptions. We also find an alignment of the aggregates during sedimentation in a gas along the drift axis leading to an axial ratio of with respect to the drift axis and an axis perpendicular to this drift. This resultr = 1. 21 5 0. 02 CCA, align is directly applicable to dust grains in protoplanetary disks and planetary atmospheres.
