In such circumstances, the <b>accounting</b> <b>treatment</b> may result in less pro-forma debt than if straight debt was used as takeover currency or to fund an acquisition. The perception was that gearing was less with a convertible than if straight debt was used instead.

Instead it has to be classified both as (1) preference capital and as (2) convertible as well.|$|E
500|$|Although the Olympus inquiry had {{questioned}} the auditors' signing {{off on the}} <b>accounting</b> <b>treatment</b> of preferred shares, and whether the handover from KPMG to Ernst & Young in 2009 was thorough, E's own review in turn questioned [...] "the thoroughness and accuracy" [...] of the Olympus inquiry's findings.

It further said that its powers of investigation were limited by their inability to question the outgoing audit firm.|$|E
500|$|The {{accounts}} of Olympus were audited in the 1990s by the Japanese affiliate of then 'big five' accounting firm Arthur Andersen until the latter collapsed in 2002, when KPMG Azsa became its auditor. KPMG remained the auditor up until 2009, {{after which the}} Ernst & Young ShinNihon (E) took over. At no point were any major issues signalled by the company's auditors; The Financial Times (FT) reported that KPMG had raised some questions when the firm audited Olympus, but audit reports were always unqualified, and E signed off on [...] "clean" [...] audit reports in 2010 and 2011. According to an email sent by former chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa that Michael Woodford made public, Olympus had replaced KPMG with E after the former expressed disagreement with the <b>accounting</b> <b>treatment</b> of the Gyrus acquisition. The FT queried why, this being the case, KPMG had {{signed off on the}} 2009 accounts. Tsutomu Okubo raised a question in the upper house of the Diet as to why the auditors apparently failed to stop the cover-up; the Japanese Institute of Certified Accountants said that it would look into the auditors' role.|$|E

500|$|According to {{a letter}} filed with the UK Registrar of Companies, the {{auditors}} to Gyrus resigned [...] "partly because of its client's accounting for the securities". KPMG qualified Gyrus' accounts {{because they could not}} ascertain that Axam was not a related party. The auditors also took issue with the <b>accounting</b> <b>treatment</b> of the preference shares. In its audit letter to Gyrus Group dated 26 April 2010, KPMG considered that there were [...] "circumstances connected with our ceasing to hold office that should be {{brought to the attention of}} the company's members or creditors." [...] Ernst & Young, the firm that succeeded KPMG, also expressed reservations about the 2010 Gyrus accounts for uncertainty, due to the lack of information about Axam. Bloomberg noted that both Gyrus annual reports were filed late: instead of filing within the nine-month statutory limit, the accounts were filed more than a year from the company's year end. In late November 2011 Michael Andrew, KPMG International global chairman, said his firm had complied with its legal obligations to pass on information related to Olympus's 2008 acquisition of Gyrus, and were removed as auditors for so doing. Andrew said: [...] "It's pretty evident to me there was very, very significant fraud and that a number of parties had been complicit." [...] However, the while the Japanese firm forced a ¥71 billion restatement of dubious valuation of certain acquired assets, the firm signed off on the financial statements in the same year that contained questionable figures other members of its global network in UK and elsewhere had apparently expressed grave reservations over.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>accounting</b> <b>treatment</b> of CDS {{used for}} hedging may not {{parallel}} the economic effects and instead, increase volatility. [...] For example, GAAP generally require that CDS be {{reported on a}} mark to market basis. [...] In contrast, assets that are held for investment, such as a commercial loan or bonds, are reported at cost, unless a probable and significant loss is expected. Thus, hedging a commercial loan using a CDS can induce considerable volatility into the income statement and balance sheet as the CDS changes value over its life due to market conditions and due to the tendency for shorter dated CDS to sell at lower prices than longer dated CDS. One can try {{to account for the}} CDS as a hedge under FASB 133 but in practice that can prove very difficult unless the risky asset owned by the bank or corporation is exactly the same as the Reference Obligation used for the particular CDS that was bought.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{focuses on}} {{alternative}} <b>accounting</b> <b>treatments</b> {{over time to}} assess {{their impact on the}} level of conservatism in a comparison between Italian local accounting standards and United States generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP). Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach is adopted to investigate the accounting ad-justments applied to net income and shareholders’ equity as included in the Form 20 -F reconciliations reported by all Italian firms that were listed on a US market over the period 1999 - 2008. The methodology first introduced by Gray (1980) and frequently applied over 30 years to several international accounting comparisons is adapted to recognise a multi-period dimension of the accounting choice. In particular, we focus on the temporal dimension of such adjustments in order to capture their attitude to reverse or become permanent over time. Findings: The results show that the level of conservatism is visible in the measurement of net assets and is shaped by the prevailing directional effect of accounting adjustments that become permanent as their cumulative reversal is persistently delayed. Such a phenomenon arises and intensifies when the accounting differences relate to recurring operations and/or to long-term assets and liabilities. Amongst them, those violating the clean surplus relation are the most controversial as they not only generate a permanent effect in the measurement of net assets, but also an opposite permanent effect in the measurement of earnings. Originality/value: Our propositions express a sequence of the timing effects of alternative <b>accounting</b> <b>treatments</b> that highlight the primary role of permanent differences in persistently shaping the value of net assets and helping to provide a less erratic interpretation of the level of conservatism. Practical implications: Identifying the duration of alternative <b>accounting</b> <b>treatments</b> is also relevant to assess the potential influence on stakeholders’ decision making process as this may steadily influence the future of a firm...|$|R
