5|$|I {{found they}} begin the festivities of Christmas by a curious procession: {{a party of}} young people procure {{the head of a}} dead horse, which is <b>affixed</b> to a pole about four feet in length; a string is <b>affixed</b> to the lower jaw; a horse-cloth is also {{attached}} to the whole, under which one of the parts gets, and by frequently pulling the string, keeps up a loud snapping noise, and is accompanied {{by the rest of the}} party, grotesquely habited, with hand-bells; they thus proceed from house to house, ringing their bells, and singing carols and songs; they are commonly gratified with beer and cake, or perhaps with money. This is called, provincially, a Hodening.|$|E
5|$|Central Atlas Tamazight's {{personal}} pronouns distinguish three persons, and two genders.

5|$|From 1840 to 1844, the Penny Black, {{and other}} stamps issued, were obliterated with the Maltese Cross cancellation. There was no text or numeral to help {{identify}} any of these cancels as Irish, but some Maltese Crosses are uniquely identifiable with certain Irish towns, including Belfast, Eyrecourt, Cork, Hollymount, Limerick and Mullingar. From 1844 on, the cancels used included text or numerals that identified the post town. Cancels of both types are easier to identify if the stamp is still <b>affixed</b> to a cover, since this makes the complete postmark visible, but a stamp no longer <b>affixed</b> to a cover may still permit identification {{of the town of}} use if enough of the postmark can be seen on the stamp itself. Numerals of Irish town cancels were uniquely set in a 4 pointed diamond shape whereas town cancels in England and Wales used an oval shape and Scotland used a rectangular form.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} types of <b>affixes,</b> namely prefixes (awalan), suffixes (akhiran), circumfixes (apitan) and infixes (sisipan). These <b>affixes</b> are {{categorised}} into noun <b>affixes,</b> verb <b>affixes,</b> and adjective <b>affixes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Joint <b>affixes</b> are the {{patterns}} which provide grammatical meaning references by forming complements or phrases. These patterns have occurred by {{the usage of}} multiple <b>affixes</b> in company. None of the <b>affixes</b> which bring about the joint <b>affixes,</b> can correspond {{the function of the}} joint <b>affix</b> itself in terms of both syntax and semantic. The <b>affixes</b> realize a new function by unifying. As convenient to this usage seventeen <b>affix</b> patterns have been fixed in Turkish. Ten of them are used with verbs and seven of them are used with nouns. The joint <b>affixes</b> which are used with verbs constitute adverbial participle phrases. The joint <b>affixes</b> which are used with nouns have the function of forming definite/chain noun complement, reduplication or phrases with two case <b>affixes.</b> In this study, functions of joint <b>affixes</b> with regard to semantic and syntax have been examine...|$|R
50|$|Lexical <b>affixes</b> (or {{semantic}} <b>affixes)</b> {{are bound}} elements that appear as <b>affixes,</b> but function as incorporated nouns within verbs and as elements of nouns.

Although similar to incorporated nouns, lexical <b>affixes</b> differ in that they never occur as freestanding nouns, i.e. they always appear as <b>affixes.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Mari Lwyd itself {{consists}} of a horse's skull that is decorated with ribbons and <b>affixed</b> to a pole; {{to the back of}} the skull is attached a white sheet, which drapes down to conceal both the pole and the individual carrying this device. On occasion, the horse's head was represented not by a skull but was instead made from wood or even paper. In some instances, the horse's jaw was able to open and close as a result of string or lever attached to it, and there are accounts of pieces of glass being <b>affixed</b> into the eye sockets of some examples, representing eyes. An observer of the tradition as it was performed at Llangynwyd during the nineteenth century noted that preparation for the activity was a communal event, with many locals involving themselves in the decorating of the Mari Lwyd.|$|E

40|$|The {{distinction}} between the <b>affix</b> and the clitic is sometimes not easy to make, as clitics also have some characteristics of <b>affixes.</b> This paper demonstrates that the clitic in Degema is distinct from the <b>affix</b> despite many features they have in common. Some of the criteria that are held to apply cross-linguistically do not absolutely distinguish the clitic from the <b>affix</b> in Degema. The paper provides background information as regards the elements that separate into clitics and <b>affixes</b> in Degema, features that are common to both clitics and <b>affixes,</b> {{and some of the}} features that are considered as distinguishing clitics from <b>affixes.</b> The definitions of the Degema clitic and <b>affix,</b> respectively, are proposed...|$|R
50|$|Inflectional <b>affixes</b> encode {{the subject}} and object of the theme. Wiyot makes a sharp {{distinction}} between definite and indefinite subjects, and each of these classes has {{its own set of}} inflectional <b>affixes.</b> Certain classes of Wiyot verbs can also take benefactive and instrumental <b>affixes.</b> The benefactive characterizes the verb as being done to a third person object for the benefit of a second object. Instrumental <b>affixes</b> convey that action is performed using a device of some kind. Instrumental and benefactive <b>affixes</b> directly encode for the subject of the verb and thus do not appear with inflectional <b>affixes</b> for subject. Therefore, the most inflectional <b>affixes</b> a verb can possibly take is three.Inflectional <b>affixes</b> can be either terminal or nonterminal in nature. Terminal <b>affixes,</b> when added to verb or noun themes, can complete words, while nonterminal <b>affixes</b> require additional affixation.The noun form rakhóhwalił, meaning he/she laughs at me, contains two inflectional <b>affixes</b> that modify the verb form rakhohw- shown above: -al is the nonterminal suffix that encodes a first person object, and -ił is the terminal suffix for a third person subject.|$|R

50|$|The {{grammatical}} {{rules of}} an <b>affix</b> grammar {{are those of}} a context-free grammar, except that certain parts in the nonterminals (the <b>affixes)</b> are used as arguments.

40|$|The {{execution}} of Turkish {{which is an}} agglutinating language is achieved mostly through <b>affixes.</b> In Turkish {{there are more than}} two hundred <b>affixes</b> most of which have more than a single usage variation. The distinction between derivational and inflectional <b>affixes</b> relating to the classification of these <b>affixes</b> is accepted rather as a superficial and insufficient classification. In this frame an apparent diversity attracts attention about works concerning the classification of <b>affixes.</b> The reason of this diversity should be searched in the differences within the features of <b>affixes</b> which have been based on and given a certain priority. Because role and function of <b>affixes</b> with regard to their usage, change according to sub-branches of linguistics.

2500|$|Since <b>affixes</b> {{may be used}} as root words, {{and roots}} may combine like <b>affixes,</b> the {{boundary}} between the two is blurred. Indeed, many so-called <b>affixes</b> are indistinguishable from other roots. However, [...] "true" [...] <b>affixes</b> are grammatically fixed as being either prefixes or suffixes, whereas the order of roots in compounds is determined by semantics.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a longstanding}} debate {{about how to}} {{appropriately}} model the combinability of <b>affixes,</b> especially English suffixes. One widely accepted principle {{is the notion of}} so-called selectional restrictions, i. e. grammatical requirements of particular <b>affixes.</b> For example, the suffix -ness can only combine with adjectival bases. Hay (2002) proposed a psycholinguistic approach to <b>affix</b> ordering now known as Complexity-Based Ordering (CBO), which claims that <b>affix</b> order is determined by the parsability of the <b>affixes,</b> i. e. more separable <b>affixes</b> can appear only outside of less separable <b>affixes.</b> Hay shows that this principle accounts for why many grammatical <b>affix</b> combinations are unattested. CBO has since been supported by research of derivational <b>affixes</b> (English prefixes, English suffixes and Russian suffixes). However, as a processing model, CBO should apply very broadly, and in this paper, I discuss some difficulties of reconciling CBO with inflectional <b>affixes.</b> I also examine combinations of Russian prefixes - which have some properties typical of inflection - and show, surprisingly, that they can be ordered with a significantly low number of cycles, as CBO predicts.
