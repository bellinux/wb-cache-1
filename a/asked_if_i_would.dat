25|$|I didn't {{play that}} well in {{stages of the}} tour and other players {{deserved}} a game. But we got to halfway through the tour and (captain) Greg Chappell {{came to me and}} said there was trouble at the top of the order and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to open the batting in the county games. I did that and I was quite successful. I think at the end of the tour I finished about fifth in the batting averages. But that didn't seem to make any difference. I was the only one who didn't play a Test match.|$|E
2500|$|Cahill later reflected: [...] "They <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> take part, {{even though}} I was only 14 {{at the time}} and it was an under-20 tournament. I saw it simply as a chance to go on holiday because my {{grandmother}} was ill at the time in Samoa. It was a chance to go back and see her on expenses as the Samoans were paying for all my flights, accommodation and living expenses. I could not have cared less about playing for them. It was a men's tournament and I never expected to play." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{produced}} the Black Crowes, and Jimmy joined {{them for a}} run of live dates in 1999. I saw the show in New York, and then I went to California and recorded the shows, took the tapes away, and fixed them up a little and mixed them. I did Live at the Greek without any input from anyone, as it wasn't originally {{going to be an}} official release. But I think everyone was impressed with it; certainly Jimmy said he was. Then, when Jimmy decided to do a new [...] DVD, he started looking for someone familiar with the modern applications necessary for surround sound mixing. If you listen to the Royal Albert Hall [...] opening in 5.1, you can see Jimmy had this audio concept really early on of giving people a sense of the band going onstage and the audience swells around you. We had a meeting to discuss the requirements needed for the DVD project audio, and afterward, he <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be interested in ‘helping’ him.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{he stopped}} and {{released}} me, standing {{between me and the}} way we had come, looking up into my face as though to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> now follow him voluntarily or if he must still resort to force.|$|R
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} a wagoner, {{who happened to}} be passing, brought me a note from Mrs. Perch, very badly spelled, <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> let one of my men bring her a pail of water, for she could not think of coming herself or letting any of the children come near my place if spouting fires were expected.|$|R
60|$|Major Selby muttered {{something}} uncomplimentary about Sir John, and then <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{come home with}} him.|$|R
2500|$|Hello Folks, Donna Deegan here. For {{those of}} you who haven't been {{watching}} this past week, where've you been? Seriously, if you haven't had the time to tune in, I have changed my name to, well, my name. So many of you have e-mailed to say [...] "Hey Donna, it's about time!" [...] Well, fortunately the station thought so too. Tim and I have been married for more than five years, and I have been Deegan everywhere but on the air since then. So why now? Well, there is no great strategy here. For some time now the station has been putting together a new look for our news opens, graphics etc. That's a big deal and very expensive so it's not done very often. While making those plans they very graciously <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to change my on-air name. I talked it over with my kids and with Tim and everyone said [...] "go for it" [...] so I did. That simple. The decision {{had nothing to do with}} my recent recurrence. It will be fun to see if I can actually call myself the correct name every day. Between chemo and my normal space cadet nature, I think the betting pool is in full swing.|$|E
2500|$|... 20/20 {{also asked}} Black Swan editor Andy Weisblum for {{his take on}} the math. He responded that [...] "there are about 35 shots that are full body shots in the movie. Of those 35 shots, 12 are Natalie, {{and then the rest}} are Sarah. But over the overall film, Natalie did a lot more than that. I mean, she did most of the other shots. It was {{sometimes}} hard for me to tell the difference as the editor, it was so close." [...] Lane further reiterated the point that prior to the Oscar ceremony, she gave an interview with Glamour for an article titled The Real Black Swan. After this interview, a Black Swan producer contacted her: [...] "He <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> please not do any more interviews until after the Oscars because it was bad for Natalie's image ... They were trying to create this image, this facade, really, that Natalie had done something extraordinary. Something that is pretty much impossible ... to become a professional ballerina in a year and half." [...] Lane also emphasized that her criticism was not directed at Portman's acting: [...] "I think she is a really beautiful actress ... I loved working with her. And she was really focused on her character every day. I definitely think she deserves all the credit that she got with the Oscar." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Lynch {{was working}} on the first few episodes of Twin Peaks, his friend Monty Montgomery [...] "gave me a book that he wanted to direct as a movie. He <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> maybe be {{executive}} producer or something, and I said 'That's great, Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?' And he said, 'In that case, you can do it yourself'." [...] The book was Barry Gifford's novel Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula, which told the tale of two lovers on a road trip. Lynch felt that it was [...] "just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened." [...] With Gifford's support, Lynch adapted the novel into a film called Wild at Heart, a crime and road movie starring Nicolas Cage as Sailor and Laura Dern as Lula. Describing his plot as a [...] "strange blend" [...] of [...] "a road picture, a love story, a psychological drama and a violent comedy", Lynch altered much from the original novel, changing the ending and incorporating numerous references to the classic film The Wizard of Oz. Despite receiving a muted response from American critics and viewers, it won the Palme d'Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival.|$|E
60|$|My friend B. {{called on}} {{me this morning}} and <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> go to a theatre with him on Monday next.|$|R
2500|$|However, in June 2003, it was {{confirmed}} that Lisa would {{once again be}} returning to the serial. Benjamin said, [...] "I couldn't believe it when I got the call a few months ago to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> return to Walford. I didn't think Lisa would give up baby Lou without one last fight." [...] The return storyline was temporary, allowing Lisa to usurp Phil and once again take custody of her daughter, with the help of Den Watts. The character then disappeared, exiting in November 2003.|$|R
60|$|Next morning Haught <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to {{ride around}} {{through the woods}} and {{probably}} get {{a shot at a}} deer. Romer coaxed so to go that I finally consented.|$|R
6000|$|RANSOM, returning: [...] "That wasn't necessary. The {{young lady}} was so {{impressed}} by my behavior, that she <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> give her some lessons {{in the use of}} oil." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Having {{explained}} the circumstances so far, Miss Westerfield next mentioned the motive which {{had brought her}} to my office. She <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> inform her of Mrs. Norman's address.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I told them. I {{was there}} last week. And {{they were so}} interested. Two days ago Miss Patty wrote me a note asking me to call; and then she <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> take her gift to you. What would you wish most from Patty's Place, Anne?" ...|$|E
60|$|He then <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> please {{to grant}} him one thing, that, {{whatever}} his opinion should be, {{what he should}} say should be no prejudice to them in their present condition.|$|R
5000|$|... "When ALA first <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> run for president, I said, 'That's {{the last}} thing in the world I want to do, conduct a Council meeting with {{everybody}} shouting, [...] "Point of order!"'" ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Peterson, [...] "He Elvis <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> mind <b>if</b> he {{recorded}} 'The Wonder of You.' I said, 'You don't {{have to ask}} permission; you're Elvis Presley.' He said, 'Yes, I do. You're Ray Peterson.'" ...|$|R
60|$|When he {{had said}} thus he comes upstairs, and I was by that time {{come out of my}} room; so he tells me the {{minister}} was below, and that he had talked with him, and that upon showing him the license, he was free to marry us with all his heart, 'but he asks to see you'; so he <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> let him come up.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I {{was trying}} on their frocks, but they trailed {{on the ground}} upon me, so she <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> come and sit by the nursery fire till my habit was dry; {{and there was a}} dear little good-humoured baby, so fair and pretty. She is not a bit shy, will go to anybody, but, they say, she likes no one so well as her brother Norman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Basta! basta!" [...] He {{turned to}} me apologetically. [...] "We have agreed to speak Italian; in that way I keep up the language; {{astonishing}} the {{number of things that}} dog will understand!" [...] I was about to take my leave, when he <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> walk a little way with him--"If you are free, that is." [...] We went up the street with Freda {{on the far side of}} her master.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not under}} trust," [...] said Antony. [...] "Your father {{may be a}} sworn servant of the Earl and, the Queen--Queen Elizabeth, I mean; but I have taken no oaths--nobody <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> come here." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{told him}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do so, {{with all the}} {{interest}} and curiosity that his preparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, he <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers [...] "at it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Attention {{was also}} given to Grayson Perry who {{exhibited}} pots decorated with sexual imagery, {{and was the}} prize winner. He wore a flouncy skirt to collect the prize, announced by Sir Peter Blake, who said, after being introduced by Sir Nicholas Serota, [...] "Thank you very much Nick. I'm quite surprised to be here tonight, because two days ago I had a phone call <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be a judge for the Not the Turner Prize. And two years ago I {{was asked by the}} Stuckists to dress as a clown and come and be on the steps outside, so I am thrilled and slightly surprised to be here." ...|$|R
60|$|Resolved {{not to lose}} {{a minute}} in getting to Knowlesbury, I paid my bill at the hotel, and hired a fly {{to take me to}} the town. A gentleman who heard me give the order, and who saw that I was going alone, {{informed}} me that he lived in the neighbourhood of Knowlesbury, and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have any objection to his getting home by sharing the fly with me. I accepted his proposal as a matter of course.|$|E
6000|$|Feb. 28.--On Sunday, Sir George Lewis {{called on}} me, and said my [...] office {{had been offered}} him. This was after being refused by [...] Cardwell and Baring. He asked my advice as to {{accepting}} it. This I [...] told him I could not give. He <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> assist him with [...] information in case of his accepting. I answered that he might [...] command me precisely as if instead of resigning I had only removed [...] to another department. I then went {{over some of the}} matters needful [...] to be made known. On Tuesday he came again, acquainted me with his [...] acceptance, and told me he had been mainly influenced by my [...] promise.[344] ...|$|E
6000|$|So it {{came about}} that when, on the {{following}} morning, I was <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{like to see the}} wonders of Ragnall Castle, I answered [...] "Yes." [...] Really, however, I wanted {{to have a look at}} Lord Ragnall himself, if possible, for the account of his many perfections had impressed the imagination of a poor colonist like myself, who had never found an opportunity of setting his eyes upon a kind of human angel. Human devils I had met in plenty, but never a single angel--at least, of the male sex. Also there was always the possibility that I might get a glimpse of the still more angelic lady to whom he was engaged, whose name, I understood, was the Hon. Miss Holmes. So I said that nothing would please me more than to see this castle.|$|E
60|$|In reply, he <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{take it for}} a {{piece of}} sincerity, if, after a trial, he should tell me his mind, and would not be displeased if he {{declined}} speaking his thoughts till he had talked with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} of what Mrs. Saltonstall said this morning. She <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{like to go to}} Paris with her for the winter. It has always been one of my dreams to go abroad, and I do hope I shall not be disappointed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems, Mr. Jackson, that The Judge {{has refused}} {{not only our}} article, but also the {{advertisement}} of the company. I don't know much about {{this side of the}} affair myself, but Sir Robert <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> come round and see if things couldn't be arranged." ...|$|R
6000|$|At length {{the little}} boy, {{who had a}} seat quite in the chimney-corner, took off his {{stockings}} and shoes, warmed his feet, and having had his sore leg freshly salved, went off to bed; then the fool made bare his knotty-looking feet and legs, and followed him; and finally the old man exposed his calves also to our gaze. We had never {{had the good fortune}} to see an old man's legs before, and were surprised to find them fair and plump as an infant's, and we thought that he took a pride in exhibiting them. He then proceeded to make preparations for retiring, discoursing meanwhile with Panurgic plainness of speech on the ills to which old humanity is subject. We were a rare haul for him. He could commonly get none but ministers to talk to, though sometimes ten of them at once, and he was glad to meet some of the laity at leisure. The evening was not long enough for him. As I had been sick, the old lady <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not go to bed,--it was getting late for old people; but the old man, who had not yet done his stories, said, [...] "You ain't particular, are you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said {{he liked}} me for telling the truth, {{and not being}} ashamed to do it! He said the sin was in the false shame and the hypocrisy; for that's {{the sort of man}} he is, you see, and that's like him always! He <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> marry him--out of hand--and do my best to be his lawful wife. He said he wanted me to think it over and sleep on it, and to-morrow he would come and see me for an answer. I slipped off the boat at 'Frisco, and went alone to a hotel where I wasn't known. In the morning I didn't know whether he'd keep his word or I'd keep mine. But he came! He said he'd marry me that very day, and take me to his farm in Santa Clara. I agreed. I thought it would take me out of everybody's knowledge, and they'd think me dead! We were married that day, before a regular clergyman. I was married under my own name,"--she stopped and looked at Jack, with a hysterical laugh,--"but he made me write {{underneath}} it, 'known as Nell Montgomery;' for he said HE wasn't ashamed of it, nor should I be." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was not so}} {{much the}} sum, as the {{occupation}} and hope given me by the office of Governor, which I took on myself, which were then so precious to me. Mr. F.'s Brewery (the site has since been changed) then stood near to Pedlar's Acre in Lambeth and the surgeon who attended my wife in her confinement, likewise took care of the wealthy brewer's family. He was a Bavarian, originally named Voelker. Mr. Lance, the surgeon, I suppose, made him acquainted with my name and history. The worthy doctor would smoke many a pipe of Virginia in my garden, and had conceived an attachment for me and my family. He brought his patron to my house; and when Mr. F. found that I had a smattering of his language, and could sing [...] "Prinz Eugen the noble Ritter" [...] (a song that my grandfather had brought home from the Marlborough wars), the German conceived a great friendship for me: his lady put her chair and her chariot at Mrs. Warrington's service: his little daughter took a prodigious fancy to our baby (and to do him justice, the Captain, who is as ugly a fellow now as ever wore a queue, was beautiful as an infant) [The very image of the Squire at 30, everybody says so. M. W. (Note in the MS.)]: and his son and heir, Master Foker, being much maltreated at Westminster School because of his father's profession of brewer, the parents <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> take charge of him; and paid me a not insufficient sum for superintending his education.|$|E
60|$|He then <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{swear to}} be secret, and that, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{did not agree}} to what he proposed, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{nevertheless}} never betray him. I readily bound myself to that, upon the most solemn imprecations and curses that the devil and both of us could invent.|$|R
60|$|I {{ought to}} have {{mentioned}} in my hurried note to you, that my knowledge of the consultation[108] in question only preceded yours by certain hours; and that Longman <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> make the design known to you, as he {{thought it might be}} a liberty to address you otherwise. This I did therefore.|$|R
5000|$|Fiori {{explained}} in an interview: [...] "One day in Corsica, when I went to Bastia, Jean-Jacques Goldman <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> possibly agree {{to sing with}} him. Then, in the Restonica, we met a young girl absolutely unknown named Christine, {{and the idea of}} a trio became imperative." [...] He also noted that the song is sad.|$|R
