5|$|Before leaving Atlantic, the Rolling Stones {{released}} Undercover (UK 3; US 4) in late 1983. Despite {{good reviews}} and the Top Ten peak {{position of the}} title track, the record sold below expectations <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> tour to support it. Subsequently, the Stones' new marketer/distributor CBS Records took over distributing the Stones' Atlantic catalogue.|$|E

5|$|When {{the north}} Manhattan Bridge tracks were closed for repairs from 1986 to 1988, in 1995, and from 2001 to 2004, this station was {{served by the}} Grand Street Shuttle to the Sixth Avenue Line <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> subway service to Brooklyn.

5|$|At {{that time}} there was dispute {{regarding}} the difference between rational numbers and irrational numbers <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> consistency {{in the way in}} which decimal fractions were represented. In 1586, Simon Stevin published a small pamphlet called De Thiende ("the tenth") which historians credit as being the basis of modern notation for decimal fractions. Stevin felt that this innovation was so significant that he declared the universal introduction of decimal coinage, measures, and weights to be merely a question of time.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 118, over {{a period}} of six months, she was {{submitted}} to neurophysiological tests and a CT scan. The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency was comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal brain lobe functions were relatively spared from deterioration <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> evidence of progressive neurological disease, depressive symptoms or other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was in fact found to improve slightly over the six-month period. Calment reportedly remained mentally intact until the end of her life.|$|E

5|$|Before {{coming to}} Cambridge, Burhop had {{not engaged in}} {{political}} activities. At Cambridge he encountered political debate generated by the suffering caused by the Great Depression {{and the rise of}} fascism in Europe. While he rejected his parents' faith in favour of rationalist science, he did not reject their values, especially that of compassion for others, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> estrangement between them. At Cambridge he embraced socialism, and believed that scientists had a moral responsibility to society, one that included fighting fascism.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2004 college {{football}} season, the Atlantic Coast Conference determined its champion via round-robin play {{during the course}} of the regular season <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> conference championship game. In 2004, the Atlantic Coast conference added two teams—Virginia Tech and Miami—expanding the league to 11 teams. At the time, {{college football}} teams were limited by the NCAA to 11regular-season games, three or four of which typically featured teams outside the home team's conference. Following the 2004season, the league added a 12th team—Boston College—and became eligible to hold a championship game at the conclusion of the 2005 season.|$|E
5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, whole-body extract immunotherapy {{was widely}} used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used for ant stings. However, fatal failures were reported, and this led to scientists to research for alternative methods of desensitisation. Before 1986 allergic reactions were not recorded <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> study on Myrmecia sting venom; whole body extracts were later used on patients during the 1990s, but this was found to be ineffective and was subsequently withdrawn. In 2003, ant venom immunotherapy was shown to be safe and effective against Myrmecia venom.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the state}} of anarchy being {{experienced}} by the city, Belgrano's death was largely unnoticed. The only newspaper of the time to note his death was El Despertador Teofilantrópico, written by Francisco de Paula Castañeda, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> government representation at his funeral. Former students of his educative institutions would arrive in the following days with obsequies, when the news started to be known. The following year the political context was less chaotic and Bernardino Rivadavia, who was minister by then, organised a massive state funeral.|$|E
5|$|Fischer {{missed the}} 1961–62 Championship (he was {{preparing}} for the 1962 Interzonal), <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> 1964–65 event. Out of eight U.S. Chess Championships, Fischer lost only three games; to Edmar Mednis in the 1962–63 event, and in consecutive rounds to Samuel Reshevsky, and Robert Byrne in the 1965 championship, culminating in a total score of 74/90 (61 wins, 26 draws, 3 losses).|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the Pact, the Scandinavian countries and Finland were relieved. The Germans and Soviets were now allies, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> German threat against the Soviet Union. But shortly afterwards, Germany invaded Poland and Great Britain and France declared war against Germany. Next, the Soviets invaded eastern Poland, and later Moscow requested that the Baltic states allow the establishment of Soviet military bases and the stationing of troops on their soil. The government of Estonia accepted the ultimatum, signing the corresponding agreement in September, while Latvia and Lithuania followed suit in October.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 26 September 1981, Bill Shankly was {{admitted}} to Broadgreen Hospital following a heart attack. His condition appeared to be stable <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> suggestion that his life was in danger. But, on the following Monday morning, his condition suddenly deteriorated and was transferred into intensive care. At 00:30 on 29 September, he suffered another cardiac arrest and was certified dead, aged 68, at 01:20. He was cremated at the Anfield Crematorium on 2 October and his ashes were scattered on the Anfield pitch at the Kop end.|$|E
5|$|San {{hunter and}} gatherers, {{ancestors}} of the Khoisani peoples, were the first known inhabitants of the region that is now Mozambique, followed in the 1st and 4th centuries by Bantu-speaking peoples who migrated there across the Zambezi River. In 1498, Portuguese explorers landed on the Mozambican coastline. Portugal's influence in East Africa grew throughout the 16th century; she established several colonies known collectively as Portuguese East Africa. Slavery and gold became profitable for the Europeans; influence was largely exercised through individual settlers <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> centralised administration and, in the meantime, Portugal had {{turned her attention to}} India and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The German army's rapid {{manoeuvres}} {{during the}} invasion had forced the tactical withdrawal of Yugoslav forces facing Hungarian army units <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> significant fighting {{between the two}} armies. The Hungarian forces advanced south to the Danube between Vukovar and the confluence with the Tisza without any real military resistance. Serb Chetnik irregulars fought isolated engagements, and the Hungarian General Staff considered irregular resistance forces to be their only significant opposition.|$|E

5|$|The Skanska case {{occurred}} during Kirchner's presidency, during which {{several members of}} de Vido's ministry were accused of bribery in requests for tender for pipeline construction, based on a tape recording of Skanska employees discussing the bribes. The case was closed in 2011, when it was ruled that the tape was not acceptable evidence <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> overpricing. It was reopened in 2016 (with Cristina Kirchner out of the government), and the tape was accepted as evidence.|$|E
5|$|The defense, {{to support}} their theory that Conley murdered Phagan in a robbery, focused on Phagan's missing purse. Conley claimed in court that he saw Frank place the purse in his office safe, {{although}} he denied having seen the purse before the trial. Another witness testified that, on the Monday after the murder, the safe was open <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> purse in it. The significance of Phagan's torn pay envelope was disputed by both sides.|$|E

From 1852 to 1888, the city was run by a Board of Trustees <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> elected mayor. However, the president of the board was called mayor as a courtesy.|$|E
