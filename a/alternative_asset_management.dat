Using secondary data collected from the Melaka Syariah Court and Amanah Raya Berhad Melaka, a number of hibah cases were identified from 2013 - 2015 and highlighted for further discussion in the paper. Interviews, telephone and email correspondences were conducted to further understand the issues concerning hibah cases and their reasoning. The findings indicated that {{the highest number of}} registered on hibah cases was recorded in 2015, increasing from 2013. The data result shows that there are more than 20 cases recorded in Melaka except only 12 cases in 2013.

Therefore, it is a need to have a standard guideline regarding hibah to avoid any dispute about this matter in the future. Besides that, the dissemination of knowledge about hibah should be done in order to increase the awareness about the acceptable procedure of hibah because it is considered as the best <b>alternative</b> of <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> and to avoid unclaimed Muslim asset...|$|R
40|$|Under the {{combined}} {{effects of climate}} and traffic, roads deteriorate, slowly {{at first and then}} at an accelerated pace once the distresses become visible and significant. At this advanced stage, remedial measures quickly become very expensive as distresses increase.

Pavement Management Systems (PMS) have been developed {{over the past two decades}} in order to offer road operators a rational and comprehensive <b>alternative.</b> More recently, <b>Asset</b> <b>Management</b> Systems (AMS) have extended this rational approach to encompass road infrastructure management. The latest and most effective systems combine into a single, consistent and deterministic framework the phases of road infrastructure assessment, maintenance programming and strategic analysis.
