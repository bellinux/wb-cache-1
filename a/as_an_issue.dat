5|$|The {{demographics}} of the Supreme Court of the United States encompass the gender, ethnicity, and religious, geographic, and economic backgrounds of the 113 {{people who have been}} appointed and confirmed as justices to the Supreme Court. Some of these characteristics have been raised <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> since the Court was established in 1789. For its first 180 years, justices were almost always white male Protestants.|$|E
5|$|The cage {{crinoline}} {{made out}} of spring steel wire was first introduced in the 1850s, with the earliest British patent for a metal crinoline (described as a 'skeleton petticoat of steel springs fastened to tape.') granted in July 1856. Alison Gernsheim suggests that the unidentified French inventor was probably R. C. Milliet of Besançon, as the July 1856 patent was filed by their British agent, C. Amet. Milliet had already patented a 'tournure de femme' in Paris on 24 April 1856 which was described as comprising 'elastic extensible circles joined together by vertical bands.' Following its introduction, the women's rights advocate Amelia Bloomer felt that her concerns about the hampering nature of multiple petticoats had been resolved, and dropped dress reform <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue.</b> Diana de Marly, in her biography of the couturier Charles Frederick Worth noted that by 1858 there existed steel factories catering solely to crinoline manufacturers, and shops that sold nothing else but crinolines. One {{of the most significant}} manufacturers of crinolines was that of Thomson & Co., founded by an American with branches across Europe and the United States. At the height of their success, up to four thousand crinolines were produced by Thomson's London factory in a day, whilst another plant in Saxony manufactured 9.5 million crinolines over a twelve-year period. In 1859 the New York factory, which employed about a thousand girls, used 300,000yards of steel wire every week to produce between three and four thousand crinolines per day, while the rival Douglas & Sherwood factory in Manhattan used a ton of steel each week in manufacturing hoop skirts.|$|E

25|$|Along with {{property}} and ideology, social lives were also held in common. As an example, most kibbutz dining halls exclusively utilized benches, not <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of cost or convenience, but because benches were construed as {{another way of}} expressing communal values.

25|$|Nussbaum condemns the {{practice}} of female genital mutilation, citing deprivation of normative human functioning in its risks to health, impact on sexual functioning, violations of dignity, and conditions of non-autonomy. Emphasizing that female genital mutilation is carried out by brute force, its irreversibility, its non-consensual nature, and its links to customs of male domination, Nussbaum urges feminists to confront female genital mutilation <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of injustice.|$|E
25|$|Psychologist Frances Cherry has {{suggested}} {{the interpretation of}} the murder <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of bystander intervention is incomplete.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse if the UN today {{constructs}} the water <b>issue</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> security <b>issue</b> and to argue about in which way the organization in that case does so alternatively why it can be said that the UN doesn’t construct the water <b>issue</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> security <b>issue.</b> In order to reach this purpose the following questions will be answered: •Does the UN construct the water <b>issue</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> security <b>issue</b> today? -If yes, in which way? -If no, why can it be said that the organisation doesn’t? The methods used are qualitative literature studies of policy documents on water from the UN. The focus is to analyze the ideas about water and to apply my theory on the concept of security, which is Barry Buzan’s framework on security, to these ideas. The main results showed that the UN strongly constructs the water <b>issue</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> environmental security <b>issue</b> for environments and species and in relatively strong terms also constructs it <b>as</b> <b>an</b> environmental security <b>issue</b> for civilisations. In rare cases the organisation constructs it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> societal security <b>issue,</b> but the UN doesn’t construct the water <b>issue</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> military, political or economic security issue...|$|R

25|$|Setting {{aside the}} will would have, in fact, {{threatened}} {{the prospects of}} James VI, by opening up a fresh legal front. It indeed specified the preference for descendants of Mary, rather than Margaret. But in its absence, {{the matter of the}} succession could not be handled <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> under statute law. If it were left to the common law, the question of how James, an alien, could inherit could be raised in a more serious form.|$|E
25|$|When Straffen's {{murder trial}} opened on 21 July, he pleaded not guilty, and the defence opted {{to leave the}} {{question}} of his sanity <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> {{to be determined by}} the jury. After the prosecution case (led by the Solicitor-General, Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller) had opened and called the first witnesses to establish the facts about the murder of Linda Bowyer, they applied to call additional evidence about the two murders in Bath. This application was resisted by Straffen's defence as prejudicial, but the judge ruled the evidence admissible.|$|E
