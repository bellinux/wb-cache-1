5|$|Ariel is the fourth-largest of the 27 known moons of Uranus. Ariel orbits and rotates in the {{equatorial}} plane of Uranus, {{which is almost}} perpendicular to the orbit of Uranus <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>has</b> an extreme seasonal cycle.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} masses of the W bosons, {{particle}} transformations or decays (e.g., flavour change) that depend on the weak interaction typically occur much more slowly than transformations or decays that depend only on the strong or electromagnetic forces. For example, a neutral pion decays electromagnetically, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>has</b> a life of only about 10−16seconds. In contrast, a charged pion can only decay through the weak interaction, and so lives about 10−8seconds, or a hundred million times longer than a neutral pion. A particularly extreme example is the weak-force decay of a free neutron, which takes about 15minutes.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 Lord Evershed {{resigned}} as Master of the Rolls, and Denning {{was appointed to}} replace him on 19 April 1962 with a salary of £9,000. Although Denning himself described it as 'a step down' he was pleased with his appointment, as he had much preferred his time with the Court of Appeal than the House of Lords. Court of Appeal judges sit in threes, and the Lords in fives (or more), so {{it was suggested that}} to get his way in the Court of Appeal Denning only had to persuade one other judge whereas in the House of Lords it was at least two. The other 'benefit' of the Court of Appeal is that it hears more cases than the House of Lords, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>has</b> a greater effect on the law. During his twenty years as Master of the Rolls, Denning could choose both which cases he heard, and the judges with whom he sat. Therefore, on most issues, he effectively had the last word; comparatively few cases went on to the House of Lords, which was at that time Britain's highest court of law.|$|E

25|$|Rome {{has long}} hosted artistic communities, foreign {{resident}} communities {{and a large}} number of foreign religious students or pilgrims <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>has</b> always been a multilingual city. Today because of mass tourism, many languages are used in servicing tourism, especially English which is widely known in tourist areas, and the city hosts large numbers of immigrants <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>has</b> many multilingual immigrant areas.|$|E

25|$|Since animal mtDNA evolves {{faster than}} nuclear genetic markers, it {{represents}} a mainstay of phylogenetics and evolutionary biology.

25|$|The King George whiting is {{a highly}} rated food fish and is common in {{southern}} Australia <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>has</b> become {{a major component of}} the commercial and recreational fisheries in this region, with aquaculture potential still being explored but apparently of low value.|$|E
25|$|Gamete production: Organisms that undergo sexual {{reproduction}} must first produce gametes, cells which have half the typical number of chromosomes of the species. Often immunity that prevents gamete production also inhibits {{secondary sexual characteristics}} <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>has</b> effects similar to castration.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from sexual}} dimorphism, {{there are many}} other {{examples}} of human genetic polymorphisms.

25|$|Message {{authentication}} codes (MACs) {{are much}} like cryptographic hash functions, except that a secret key {{can be used}} to authenticate the hash value upon receipt; this additional complication blocks an attack scheme against bare digest algorithms, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>has</b> been thought worth the effort.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the {{production}} of unit of hydrogen fuel by steam reformation or electrolysis was approximately 3 to 6 times more expensive than {{the production}} of an equivalent unit of fuel from natural gas. When evaluating costs, fossil fuels are generally used as the reference. The energy content of these fuels is not a product of human effort <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>has</b> no cost assigned to it. Only the extraction, refining, transportation and production costs are considered. On the other hand, the energy content of a unit of hydrogen fuel must be manufactured, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>has</b> a significant cost, on top of all the costs of refining, transportation, and distribution. Systems which use renewably generated electricity more directly, for example in trolleybuses, or in battery electric vehicles may have a significant economic advantage because there are fewer conversion processes required between primary energy source and point of use.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} {{independent}} nations has grown rapidly since World War II, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>has</b> {{the number of}} coin issuing authorities. Countries {{of the third world}} generally have a very small domestic demand for collector coins, hence the non-circulating commemoratives issued are oriented towards the international market for collector items. Circulating commemoratives are found in the third World as well as in western nations. India has been issuing circulating commemoratives frequently since the 1960s. Almost every nation in the world have issued commemorative coins.|$|E
25|$|The Moplah {{rebellion}} witnessed many cruel {{attacks on}} Hindus, and the British officers.

25|$|When {{fastening}} a three-button suit, {{the middle}} button is fastened, {{and the top}} one sometimes, but the bottom is traditionally not designed to be (although in the past some jackets were cut {{so that it could}} be fastened without distorting the drape; {{this is not the case}} with current clothing). A four-button suit is untraditional <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>has</b> no traditional guidelines on buttoning, but the middle ones at least should be fastened. Additionally, the one button suit has regained some popularity (it is also one of the classic styles of Savile Row tailoring). The button should always be fastened while standing.|$|E
25|$|Compton {{has been}} {{referred}} to on numerous occasions in gang affiliation, gangsta rap and g-funk songs, especially in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>has</b> attained an association not only with gang violence and crime, but with hip hop music as well. The city is known as the home of many famous rappers. (see list List of people from Compton, California#Arts and entertainment) Compton has evolved into a younger community; the median age of people living in Compton was 25 {{at the time of the}} last full census survey in 2010; the United States average at the time was 35.3.|$|E
