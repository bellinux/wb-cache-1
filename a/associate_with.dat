5|$|When {{he assumed}} his Senate seat in 1855, Crittenden was sixty-nine years old, the eldest {{member of that}} body.

Despite his misgivings about some of the party platform, he campaigned on behalf of Millard Fillmore, the party's candidate in the 1856 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|In eukaryotes, {{modifications}} of RNA nucleotides are in general directed by small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA; 60–300nt), {{found in the}} nucleolus and cajal bodies. snoRNAs <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> enzymes and guide them to a spot on an RNA by basepairing to that RNA. These enzymes then perform the nucleotide modification. rRNAs and tRNAs are extensively modified, but snRNAs and mRNAs can also be the target of base modification. RNA can also be methylated.|$|E

5|$|The Mangalorean Catholics {{constituted}} {{a small community}} widely scattered across the South Canara district.

The Hindus, including the indigenous Brahmins (mostly belonging to the Shivalli, Havyaka, and Kota sub-groups) and Bunts did not <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> the Catholics and would not admit them into their houses on account of their religion. However, a close contact was kept by the Catholics with the Hindus of the same caste who were refugees from Goa. Catholics would invite their Hindu cousins to festivities such as birth celebrations, weddings, and funeral feasts. The Hindus accepted such invitations.
