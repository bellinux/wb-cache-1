25|$|The {{range of}} three six-cylinder engines carried {{over to the}} HT series, however the {{transmission}} options for the V8 engines were many and varied. Initially, the 253 V8 only came with either three-speed column- or four-speed floor-mounted manual transmissions. The 307 V8 was only available with two-speed Powerglide automatic. This arrangement continued until the 307 stocks were exhausted, following which the 253 and 308 locally built V8 engines could then be ordered with <b>any</b> <b>manual</b> or automatic transmission across the range, excepting the Holden Brougham which was always specified as a 308 automatic. A new locally manufactured three-speed automatic transmission, the Tri-Matic, was introduced late {{in the life of}} the HT range, except on HT Brougham which retained the two-speed automatic Powerglide transmission.|$|E

500|$|The {{nature of}} the afterlife which the dead person enjoyed is {{difficult}} to define, because of the differing traditions within Ancient Egyptian religion. In the Book of the Dead, the dead were taken into {{the presence of the}} god Osiris, who was confined to the subterranean Duat. There are also spells to enable the ba or akh of the dead to join Ra as he travelled the sky in his sun-barque, and help him fight off Apep. As well as joining the Gods, the Book of the Dead also depicts the dead living on in the 'Field of Reeds', a paradisiac likeness of the real world. The Field of Reeds is depicted as a lush, plentiful version of the Egypt of the living. There are fields, crops, oxen, people and waterways. The deceased person is shown encountering the Great Ennead, a group of gods, as well as his or her own parents. While the depiction of the Field of Reeds is pleasant and plentiful, {{it is also clear that}} manual labour is required. For this reason burials included a number of statuettes named shabti, or later ushebti. These statuettes were inscribed with a spell, also included in the Book of the Dead, requiring them to undertake <b>any</b> <b>manual</b> labour that might be the owner's duty in the afterlife. It is also clear that the dead not only went to a place where the gods lived, but that they acquired divine characteristics themselves. In many occasions, the deceased is mentioned as [...] "The Osiris – [...] " [...] in the Book of the Dead.|$|E
2500|$|Penniman {{was famous}} for her skill in {{gardening}} and her garden was stocked with a rare variety of plants and shrubs. And {{it was here that}} two herbaria were made by Mrs. Penniman and her youngest daughter Adelia, who was born in 1800. The region around the High Bridge was discovered by a Massachusetts botanist, who botanized {{the west side of the}} state in 1829, to be “a remarkable region, rich in rare and interesting plants.” A part of this “remarkable region" [...] was comprised in the Penniman farm, and here, in 1814, the mother/daughter botanists found and preserved their specimens. They doubtless followed the windings of the river in both directions and are known to have gone often through the woods then on the site of the Fort in their search for wild flowers. Not satisfied with the pressed flowers in the herbarium, they carried home the plants from their native haunts and cultivated and improved them in the home garden. Botany was said to be Mrs. Penniman’s “favorite amusement.” This was before <b>any</b> <b>manual</b> of botany had been published in this country. But botanical textbooks were not the only books published in the old country to be found in this home. A granddaughter of Penniman tells how each of Scott’s novels was purchased as soon as it appeared, and how eagerly it was read and the question of authorship discussed by the whole circle of friends of the family. It may be that the specimens in these small herbaria were the oldest in the state, for the oldest in the herbaria of the University of Vermont are dated 1819. There were 80 or 90 specimens in each herbarium, although quite a number of cultivated plants are included. Many of the botanical names have long since been changed, and one at least, the ground or moss pink, had not been listed in the Vermont Flora, though reported as a recent “find” from Wallingford and also from Colchester.|$|E
60|$|L. Well, I {{suppose the}} Egyptian queens thought every body got cramp in their neck, if they sewed long; and that thread always cut people's fingers. At all events, {{every kind of}} manual labour was despised both by them, and the Greeks; and, while they owned the real good and fruit of it, they yet held it a {{degradation}} to all who practised it. Also, knowing the laws of life thoroughly, they perceived that the special practice necessary to bring <b>any</b> <b>manual</b> art to perfection strengthened the body distortedly; one energy or member gaining {{at the expense of}} the rest. They especially dreaded and despised any kind of work that had to be done near fire: yet, feeling what they owed to it in metal-work, as the basis of all other work, they expressed this mixed reverence and scorn in the varied types of the lame Hephæstus, and the lower Pthah.|$|E

I have a small income of my own, so that I should not be a burthen on the mission, and understanding that mechanical arts are found useful, I will mention that I learnt shoemaking at Milbank, and carpentry at Portland, and I would gladly undertake <b>any</b> <b>manual</b> occupation needed in a mission. Latterly I was employed in the schoolmaster's department; and I have some knowledge of music. My education is of course, imperfect, but I am endeavouring to improve myself.

After the three, hours' work, which constitutes a day's work with us, is done, the young people have all sorts of games and sports, and they carry them as late into life as the temperament of each demands. But what I was saying to Mr. Twelvemough--perhaps I did not make myself clear--was that we should regard the sterile putting forth of strength in exercise, if others were each day worn out with hard manual labor, as insane or immoral. But I can account for it differently with you, because I understand that in your conditions a person of leisure could not do <b>any</b> <b>manual</b> labor without taking away the work of some one who needed it to live by; and could not even relieve an overworked laborer, and give him the money for the work, without teaching him habits of idleness. In Altruria we can all keep ourselves well by doing each his share of hard work, and we can help those who are exhausted, when such a thing happens, without injuring them materially or morally." ...|$|E

The deformation interface allows for performing various deformations, including stretching, compressing, squeezing, enlarging, twisting and tapering, on shapes interactively mimicking how they are done in real life. The manipulation interface allows an object to be directly grabbed and manipulated with either one or two hands, while also smoothly switching between them. Constrained methods are also provided for precise manipulation. An intuitive metaphor {{is designed to help}} the users to discover the interaction techniques by themselves without <b>any</b> <b>manuals</b> or instructions. A rendering pipeline, based on function-based extension of VRML/X 3 D, is designed with hidden complexity to support the proposed functionalities of the system.
