One observer described it as [...] "so understated that [...] is easy to miss even when one is looking for it", while another said [...] "pass by <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> think it's {{the home of a}} batty husband and wife who rarely go outside". [...] The building has a dirty awning and cheap blinds that give the impression the business is closed for remodeling. Schwa is surrounded by dingy buildings and a tire store featuring plastic palm trees.|$|E
500|$|Coward was {{homosexual}} but, {{following the}} convention of his times, this was never publicly mentioned. The critic Kenneth Tynan's description in 1953 {{was close to}} an acknowledgment of Coward's sexuality: [...] "Forty years ago he was Slightly in Peter Pan, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> {{say that he has}} been wholly in Peter Pan ever since. No private considerations have been allowed to deflect the drive of his career; like Gielgud and Rattigan, like the late Ivor Novello, he is a congenital bachelor." [...] Coward firmly believed his private business was not for public discussion, considering [...] "any sexual activities when over-advertised" [...] to be tasteless. Even in the 1960s, Coward refused to acknowledge his sexual orientation publicly, wryly observing, [...] "There are still a few old ladies in Worthing who don't know." [...] Despite this reticence, he encouraged his secretary Cole Lesley to write a frank biography once Coward was safely dead.|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{was born}} in Winchester, Massachusetts on March 16, 1982. While he was in second grade, he moved to Londonderry, New Hampshire. Today, he talks little of his {{childhood}} except to discuss his father, Mike Wilson, who was an Air Force veteran and a demanding perfectionist. During fall, he would have Brian bag leaves and bury them in the woods; and in winter, he would have Brian spend seven hours shoveling snow on weekends. Brian said in a 2011 interview, [...] "I think that's how {{you need to be}} raised. It's not your friend, it's your dad. And he's going to be strict. And one day you're going to understand why. And sometimes, it's a little too late. They might pass away, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not get that chance to say thanks or understand why you did those things. But when you become a man, you understand why." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} intended for a rock opera Townshend {{had been working}} on, Lifehouse, which was a multi-media exercise based on his followings of the Indian religious avatar Meher Baba, showing how spiritual enlightenment could be obtained via a combination of band and audience. The song was written {{for the end of}} the opera, after the main character, Bobby, is killed and the [...] "universal chord" [...] is sounded. The main characters disappear, leaving behind the government and army, who are left to bully each other. Townshend described the song as one [...] "that screams defiance at those who feel any cause is better than no cause". He later said that the song was not strictly anti-revolution despite the lyric [...] "We'll be fighting in the streets", but stressed that revolution could be unpredictable, adding, [...] "Don't expect to see what you expect to see. Expect nothing <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> gain everything." [...] Bassist John Entwistle later said that the song showed Townshend [...] "saying things that really mattered to him, and saying them for the first time." ...|$|E
500|$|Louise Nevelson {{has been}} a {{fundamental}} key in the feminist art movement. Credited with triggering the examination of femininity in art, Nevelson challenged the vision of what type of art women would be creating with her dark, monumental, masculine and totem-like artworks. Nevelson believed that art reflected the individual, not [...] "masculine-feminine labels", and chose to take on her role as an artist, not specifically a female artist. Reviews of Nevelson's works in the 1940s wrote her off as just a woman artist. A reviewer of her 1941 exhibition at Nierendorf Gallery stated: [...] "We learned the artist is a woman, in time to check our enthusiasm. Had it been otherwise, we might have hailed these sculptural expressions as by surely a great figure among moderns." [...] Another review was similar in its sexism: [...] "Nevelson is a sculptor; she comes from Portland, Maine. You'll deny both these facts <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> even insist Nevelson is a man, when you see her Portraits in Paint, showing this month at the Nierendorf Gallery." ...|$|E
2500|$|Project {{director}} Casey Hudson {{said that}} one of the greatest achievements and one of the greatest risks was the combat system. [...] "We wanted to create something that combined the strategic aspects of our Baldur's Gate series and Neverwinter Nights but which presented it through fast, cinematic 3D action," [...] Hudson said. [...] "That required us to make something that hadn't really been done before." [...] The developers intended to make the game have more open-ended gameplay. Gallo compared some situations to Deus Ex: [...] "You have several ways to get through an area <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> need a character who has a specific skill to do that." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Such a class {{you must}} have, {{or you would}} not have that other class which leads progress, civilization, and refinement. It {{constitutes}} the very mud-sill of society and of political government; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> as well attempt to build a house in the air, as to build either the one or the other, except on this mud-sill." [...] Hammond believed that in every class one group must accomplish all the menial duties, because without them the leaders in society could not progress. He argued that the hired laborers of the North were slaves too: [...] "The difference… is, that our slaves are hired for life and well compensated; there is no starvation, no begging, no want of employment," [...] while those in the North had to search for employment.|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Chris Roper scored Mob Wars 6.2 out of 10, writing [...] "there are {{a number}} of areas where the ball was dropped." [...] He was mildly {{impressed}} with the card gameplay, but felt it wasn't enough to [...] "help the game rise above mediocrity." [...] He called the game [...] "an interesting idea, but it doesn't feel cohesive enough or like either part was pushed as far as it could go." [...] GameSpot's Greg Mueller scored it 6 out of 10. He too was more impressed with Mob Wars mode than Story Mode, writing [...] "it sounds like the makings of an experiment gone awry, like some sort of Frankenstein's monster of game design, but it's actually playable--and even fun." [...] However, he called the connection between Story Mode and Mob Wars [...] "tenuous and disjointed." [...] He concluded [...] "Mob Wars doesn't live up to its potential. There are some flashes of a good game in there, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have fun for the first couple of hours, but unfortunately that enjoyment is fleeting, and you'll be left feeling aggravated and disappointed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{one of the}} {{international}} alpine skiing classifiers was Mirre Kipfer. [...] She said [...] "Sometimes athletes try to cheat, to hide what they can really do. [...] They are athletes {{who want to be}} in a class [...] that is more advantageous to for them. [...] In testing and classification they don't show what they can really do. [...] They try to show that they are not able to do some movement, and that is why we have started functional testing." [...] She goes on to say [...] "The second problem is that when you have a very good athlete who is very well trained in the sport, you don't want to punish that person for their good performance. [...] He or she might be an elite athlete doing a very good sport performance, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> be tempted to say 'OK, he is doing so well he must be in another class.' We do try to get fewer classes so that we don't get, for example, 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports. [...] We try to review the classes, but you always have borderline classes and it is always difficult. [...] In winter the aim is to have three classes, like sitting, standing and blind: that is certainly the future that we are all looking to." ...|$|E
