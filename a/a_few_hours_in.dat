In 1949 and 1967, snow stayed on the ground for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> higher locations like Point Loma and La Jolla. The other three occasions, in 1882, 1946, and 1987, involved flurries but no accumulation.|$|E

On Thursdays and Sundays, flights are handled {{in a period}} of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the mornings and on Saturdays only the evening hours are used. Often there are days when 10,000 passengers on 120 flights are channelled through the 2,800m2 terminal, counting as one of the highest peak loads worldwide in this category.|$|E
5|$|Okapis are {{primarily}} diurnal {{but may be}} active for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. Okapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. Rut in males and estrus in females {{does not depend on}} the season. In captivity, estrous cycles recur every 15 days. The gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months.|$|E

5|$|The {{sea otter}} is diurnal. It has {{a period of}} {{foraging}} and eating in the morning, starting {{about an hour before}} sunrise, then rests or sleeps in mid-day. Foraging resumes for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the afternoon and subsides before sunset, and a third foraging period may occur around midnight. Females with pups appear to be more inclined to feed at night. Observations of the amount of time a sea otter must spend each day foraging range from 24 to 60%, apparently depending on the availability of food in the area.|$|E
5|$|On February 10, a VNQDD member injured a {{policeman}} at a Hanoi checkpoint; at night, Arts students threw bombs at government buildings, which they regarded {{as part of}} the repressive power of the colonial state. On the night of February 1516, Học and his remaining forces seized the nearby villages of Phu Duc and Vĩnh Bảo, in Thái Bình and Hải Dương provinces respectively, for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours.</b> <b>In</b> the second village, the VNQDD killed the local mandarin of the French colonial government, Tri Huyen. On February 16, French warplanes responded by bombarding the VNQDD's last base at Co Am village; on the same day, Tonkin's Resident Superior René Robin dispatched 200 Gardes indigènes, eight French commanders and two Sûreté inspectors. A few further violent incidents occurred until February 22, when Governor-General Pierre Pasquier declared that the insurrection had been defeated. Học and his lieutenants, Chinh and Nguyen Thanh Loi, were apprehended.|$|E
5|$|While some {{cockatoos}} are generalists {{taking a}} wide range of foods, others are specialists. The glossy black cockatoo specialises in the cones of trees of the genus Allocasuarina, preferring a single species, A. verticillata. It holds the cones in its foot and shreds them with its powerful bill before removing the seeds with its tongue. Some species take large numbers of insects, particularly when breeding; in fact the bulk of the yellow-tailed black cockatoo's diet is made up of insects. The large bill is used in order to extract grubs and larvae from rotting wood. The amount of time cockatoos have to spend foraging varies with the season. During times of plenty they may need to feed for only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the day, in the morning and evening, then {{spend the rest of the}} day roosting or preening in trees, but during the winter most of the day may be spent foraging. The birds have increased nutritional requirements during the breeding season, so they spend more time foraging for food during this time. Cockatoos have large crops, which allow them to store and digest food for some time after retiring to a tree. During hard times, the cockatoos also display versatility in their diet, travelling widely in order to find food, feeding on more green plant material and in some species using their large bills to dig up corms.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of very few varieties, known as teinturiers, most wine grapes produce clear or colorless juice. This includes such well known red wine grape varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir. The color in red wine comes from phenolics in the skin called anthocyanins that react with other components in wine (such as tannins, acetaldehyde and pyruvic acid) to form polymeric pigments. The anthocyanins are extracted from the skin {{during the process of}} maceration which can last from <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the case of some rosés (which usually only have 20–50mg/l of anthocyanins) to several days in the case of most red wines (which often have in excess of 250mg/l of anthocyanins).|$|E
25|$|Yaks mate in the summer, {{typically}} between July and September, {{depending on}} the local environment. For {{the remainder of the}} year, many bulls wander in small bachelor groups away from the large herds, but, as the rut approaches, they become aggressive and regularly fight among each other to establish dominance. In addition to non-violent threat displays, bellowing, and scraping the ground with their horns, bull yaks also compete more directly, repeatedly charging at each other with heads lowered or sparring with their horns. Like bison, but unlike cattle, males wallow in dry soil during the rut, often while scent-marking with urine or dung. Females enter oestrus up to four times a year, and females are receptive only for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> each cycle.|$|E
25|$|In 1354 Charles {{crossed the}} Alps without an army, {{received}} the Lombard crown in St. Ambrose Basilica, Milan, on 5January1355, and was crowned emperor at Rome by a cardinal in April {{of the same}} year. His sole object {{appears to have been}} to obtain the Imperial crown in peace, in accordance with a promise previously made to Pope Clement. He only remained in the city for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> <b>in</b> spite of the expressed wishes of the Roman people. Having virtually abandoned all the Imperial rights in Italy, the emperor re-crossed the Alps, pursued by the scornful words of Petrarch, but laden with considerable wealth. On his return, Charles was occupied with the administration of the Empire, then just recovering from the Black Death, and in 1356 he promulgated the famous Golden Bull to regulate the election of the king.|$|E

25|$|On January 10, 1917 Wedge {{was arrested}} {{on a charge of}} using slanderous {{language}} on January 1, 1917 to a former member of his congregation, whom Wedge had ousted from church membership for irregular conduct. On January 13, 1917, Wedge was jailed for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> Rhinelander after being found guilty of using abusive language. After pleading not guilty, Wedge admitted the charge, but indicated he had been provoked, and refused to pay the fine of $5 and costs. Wedge was released after the fine was paid anonymously. On February 18, 1917 Wedge was admitted to St. Mary's Hospital after collapsing while preaching in the evening service at the Rhinelander First Baptist Church, and was unable to complete the service. On February 23, 1918 Wedge resigned from the First Baptist church due to his health and departed for Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he planned to remain until he regained his health and then return to his pastorate.|$|E
25|$|Watchmen, as {{guardians of}} {{the peace of the}} streets, were {{supposed}} to deal within the confines of their beat with drunkenness, soliciting, and petty tumults, and detaining suspicious characters. However, they were often willing to concede privileges to certain prostitutes, consequently provoking parishioners' complains about their inability to enforce the law. Indeed, even the prostitutes taken up by the watch were frequently released after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the watch house without seeing any magistrate. The circumstances changed when theft or some other kind of crimes were committed. Public opinion, and Moreton too, firmly believed that these women needed to be restrained in their liberties not only for their vices and immoralities but because they represented a real threat to common living. Unfortunately, most of the times this was easier said than done. Watchmen had the power to apprehend criminals within the boundaries of their parish, and they were liable to be reprimanded for leaving their beats. So they might not have been so inclined to chase a woman who crossed into another parish in order to avoid being taken.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that between people, Ebola disease spreads only by {{direct contact with the}} blood or other body fluids of a person who has developed symptoms of the disease. Body fluids that may contain Ebola viruses include saliva, mucus, vomit, feces, sweat, tears, breast milk, urine and semen. The WHO states that only people who are very sick are able to spread Ebola disease in saliva, and whole virus has not been reported to be transmitted through sweat. Most people spread the virus through blood, feces and vomit. Entry points for the virus include the nose, mouth, eyes, open wounds, cuts and abrasions. Ebola may be spread through large droplets; however, this {{is believed}} to occur only when a person is very sick. This contamination can happen if a person is splashed with droplets. Contact with surfaces or objects contaminated by the virus, particularly needles and syringes, may also transmit the infection. The virus is able to survive on objects for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> a dried state, and can survive for a few days within body fluids outside of a person.|$|E
