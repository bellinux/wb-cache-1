[...] It is hypothesized that the Malagasy sacred ibis evolved from the <b>African</b> <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis</b> when the latter supposedly spread to and colonized Madagascar from mainland Africa.|$|E

50|$|Because this ibis has {{historically}} been widely considered conspecific with the <b>African</b> <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis,</b> no early separate conservation measures have been proposed for the former.

50|$|The Réunion ibis or Réunion {{sacred ibis}} (Threskiornis solitarius) is an extinct species of ibis that was endemic to the {{volcanic}} island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean.

50|$|Mangrove swamps are {{important}} feeding grounds for fish, birds and animals. Marine wildlife includes oysters and shrimps. Mammals found here include the African manatee. Birds in these wet habitats include Goliath heron, purple heron, cattle egret, striated heron, western reef heron, greater flamingo, lesser flamingo, African spoonbill, and <b>African</b> <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis.</b> The forests also provide important habitat for migratory birds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis</b> {{has been}} {{introduced}} into France, Italy, Spain, Taiwan, and Bahrain. Some studies indicate that the growing introduced populations in southern Europe have significant economic and ecological impacts, while others suggest that they constitute no substantial threat to native European bird species. The adaptable ibises supplement their diet by feeding at rubbish tips, which helps them to survive the winter in these temperate regions.|$|E

50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis</b> was {{an object}} of {{religious}} veneration in ancient Egypt, particularly associated with the deity Djehuty or otherwise commonly referred to in Greek as Thoth. He is responsible for writing, mathematics, measurement and {{time as well as}} the moon and magic. In artworks of the Late Period of Ancient Egypt, Thoth is popularly depicted as an ibis-headed man in the act of writing.|$|E
5000|$|Contemporary {{accounts}} {{described the}} species as having white and grey plumage merging into yellow, black wing tips and tail feathers, a long neck and legs, and limited flight capabilities. Dubois' 1674 account {{is the most}} detailed contemporary description of the bird, here as translated by Hugh Strickland in 1848: Solitaires. These birds are so called because they always go alone. They are {{the size of a}} large Goose, and are white, with the tips of the wings and tail black. The tail feathers resemble those of an Ostrich; the neck is long, and the beak is like that of a Woodcock, but larger; the legs and feet like those of Turkeys. This bird has recourse to running, as it flies but very little. The plumage colouration mentioned is similar to that of the related <b>African</b> <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis</b> and straw-necked ibis, which are also mainly white and glossy black. In the reproductive season, the ornamental feathers on the back and wing tips of the <b>African</b> <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis</b> look similar to the feathers of an ostrich, which echoes Dubois' description. Likewise, a subfossil lower jaw found in 1994 showed that the bill of the Réunion ibis was relatively short and straight for an ibis, which corresponds with Dubois' woodcock comparison. Cheke and Hume have suggested that the French word (bécasse) from Dubois' original description, usually translated to [...] "woodcock", could also mean oystercatcher, another bird with a long, straight, but slightly more robust, bill. They have also pointed out that the last sentence is mistranslated, and actually means the bird could be caught by running after it. The bright colouration of the plumage mentioned by some authors may refer to iridescence, as seen in the straw-necked ibis.|$|E
50|$|Subfossils of the Réunion ibis {{show that}} it was more robust, likely much heavier, and had a larger head than the African sacred and straw-necked ibises. It was {{nonetheless}} similar to them in most features. According to Hume, it would have been no longer than 65 cm (25 in) in length, the size of the <b>African</b> <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis.</b> Rough protuberances on the wing bones of the Réunion ibis {{are similar to those of}} birds that use their wings in combat. It was perhaps flightless, but this has not left significant osteological traces; no complete skeletons have been collected, but of the known pectoral elements, only one feature indicates reduction in flight capability. The coracoid is elongated and the radius and ulna are robust, as in flighted birds, but a particular foramen between a metacarpal and the alular is otherwise only known from flightless birds, such as some ratites, penguins, and several extinct species.|$|E
