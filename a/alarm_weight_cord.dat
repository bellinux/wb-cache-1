The aim {{of this study is to}} measure the levels of PCBs and OH-PCBs in maternal and cord blood samples in a population with background levels of PCBs. We analyzed 51 maternal and corresponding cord blood samples in the northern part of the Netherlands. The PCB concentrations in maternal plasma ranged from 2 to 293 ng/g lipid, and OH-PCB concentrations from nondetectable (ND) to 0. 62 ng/g fresh <b>weight.</b> In <b>cord</b> plasma, PCB concentrations were 1 – 277 ng/g lipid, and OH-PCB concentrations, ND to 0. 47 ng/g fresh <b>weight.</b> The <b>cord</b> versus maternal blood calculated ratio was 1. 28 ± 0. 56 for PCBs and 2. 11 ± 1. 33 for OH-PCBs, expressed per gram of lipid. When expressed per gram fresh weight, the ratios are 0. 32 ± 0. 15 and 0. 53 ± 0. 23 for PCBs and OH-PCBs, respectively. A significant correlation between the respective maternal and cord levels for both PCBs and OH-PCBs was found. Our results indicate that OH-PCBs and PCBs are transferred across the placenta to the fetus in concentrations resulting in levels of approximately 50 and 30 %, respectively, of those in maternal plasma.

The study included 54 pregnant women at delivery with their corresponding full term newborns. They were chosen {{to be free of}} any medical or obstetric problems that may interfere with intrauterine growth and development. Newborn body weight, length, head circumference, arm circumference, chest circumference and Ponderal Index (PI = weight in grams/length in cm 3) were recorded. Serum albumin, prealbumin, retinol binding protein, transferrin and fibronectin in maternal and cord blood were evaluated using radial immunodiffusion kits. Cases were put into two groups: low birth weight equal to or less than 2. 5 kg (n = 24) and control above 2. 5 kg (n = 30). In low birth weight group, the correlation between maternal weight and neonatal birth-weight, PI and cord fibronectin was significantly positive. It was negative between maternal body weight and neonatal length, head and chest and arm circumferences. Correlation between maternal BMI and neonatal <b>weight,</b> <b>cord</b> blood albumin and fibronectin was significantly positive. It was negative between BMI and neonatal length, PI, head and chest and arm circumferences. In both studied groups, maternal height positively correlated with neonatal weight.

At birth, birth <b>weight</b> and <b>cord</b> blood c-peptide, glucose, insulin, visfatin, leptin, adiponectin and IL 6 in each neonate were measured. RESULTS: First trimester maternal BMI correlated positively with cord blood c-peptide (p= 0. 035, r= 0. 74) and negatively with cord blood visfatin (p= 0. 049, r=- 0. 67).

Folate and vitamin B 12 (Vit-B 12) are necessary during foetal development and their deficiency prevalence in Indians is very high. The objective of the present paper is to assess whether foetal homocysteine (Hcy) /folate metabolic pathway genes, their cofactors and homocysteine level independently (or collectively) predispose children to Low birth <b>weight.</b> Methods: <b>Cord</b> blood was collected for the study. Frequency of 5 SNPs in 4 -Hcy-pathway genes, and levels of Hcy, Vit-B 12 and folate were evaluated. Results: Of the 421 newborns recruited for the study, 38 % showed low birth weight (< 2. 5 kg) and 16 % were preterm babies. 101 neonates developed neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (NNH). High prevalence of Vit-B 12 (65 %) and folate (27 %) deficiency was observed in newborns along with hyperhomocystinemia (hypHcy- 25 %). Preterm delivery, micronutrient deficiency, hypHcy and MTHFR 677 T SNP are associated as risk factor while G allele of TCN 2 C 776 G is protective against LBW.

40|$|When {{studying}} {{the relationship of}} trace elements with human health, it becomes increasingly evident that keeping a balanced level of minerals in every cell {{of the human body}} may be crucial to optimising health and preventing disease. Dietary deficiencies of trace elements have been reported to alter various aspects of reproductive physiology, however, there is an <b>alarming</b> <b>weighting</b> towards studies focusing on their involvement in male reproductive function. Furthermore, those studies which are female focused have a tendency to investigate the role of trace elements in maintaining a healthy pregnancy, and the impact on offspring, as opposed to addressing preconception ovarian function. This research predominantly used a combination of two synchrotron-based X-ray techniques, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging, to investigate the role that trace elements play in female reproductive function. More specifically, by probing the in situ bioaccumulation of trace elements in bovine ovaries, important findings were made regarding the distribution of iron (Fe), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) which were localised to specific structures. Additionally, widespread high levels of bromine (Br) were observed across all imaged tissues. By classifying the ovarian follicles according to their health status, as well as their size (follicular diameter), and extracting average elemental concentrations for these follicles from the XRF images, it was possible to quantitatively analyse the cohort of 97 imaged follicles. Statistically significant differences were found for the elements Fe and Br (health status), and for Se (size). Se appeared to be the element which most greatly distinguished large (> 10 mm) antral follicles from smaller counterparts and PCA scores plots supported this notion with the large follicles deviating {{from the rest of the}} cohort. Owing to the statistically significant and very precise localisation of Se to the granulosa cells of large healthy follicles, a suite of additional biologically-based experiments were performed (quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (qRTPCR), immunohistochemical staining, and Western immunoblotting) in order to identify the Se species as glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx 1). Taking into account what is already known about this selenoprotein, it was concluded that Se and selenoproteins may play a critical role as an antioxidant during late follicular development. There has been much debate about the essentiality of Br to human and animal life. Owing to its high levels across all ovarian tissues imaged, subsequent experimentation was carried out to probe the chemical form of this element. Analyses of the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of a variety of mammalian tissues and fluids led to the conclusion that the form of Br in all samples, detected under normal physiological conditions, was bromide. The application of synchrotron radiation to measure trace elemental distributions in bovine ovaries at such high resolutions has provided new insights into this organ. While this research was intended to form a baseline study for healthy ovaries, if extended to disease states in the future, our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms occurring in this complex organ could be significantly enhanced.

The use of an age threshold (typically 45 years) and the identification of <b>alarm</b> features, including <b>weight</b> loss, repeated vomiting, and signs of bleeding, seem to be valid on the basis o...|$|R
40|$|The in-utero {{environment}} affects fetal development; it {{is vital}} to understand how maternal diet during pregnancy influences childhood body composition. While research indicates that triglycerides in hyperglycaemic women may increase birth weight, little is known about this relationship in euglycemic women. This study examines the relationship between maternal blood lipid status and infant adiposity up to 2 years of age. Data from 331 mother-child pairs from the ROLO longitudinal birth cohort study was analysed. Maternal dietary intakes were recorded and fasting blood lipids, leptin and HOMA were measured in early and late pregnancy and cord blood. Infant anthropometric measurements and skin-fold thicknesses were recorded at birth, 6 months and 2 years. Correlation and regression analyses were used to explore associations between maternal blood lipid status and infant adiposity. All maternal blood lipids increased significantly during pregnancy. Maternal dietary fat intake was positively associated with total cholesterol levels in early pregnancy. Late pregnancy triglycerides were positively associated with birth weight (P = 0. 03) while cord blood triglycerides were negatively associated with birth weight (P = 0. 01). Cord HDL-C was negatively associated with infant weight at 6 months (P = 0. 005). No other maternal blood lipids were associated with infant weight or adiposity up to 2 years of age. Maternal and fetal triglycerides were associated with birth <b>weight</b> and <b>cord</b> HDL-C with <b>weight</b> at 6 months. Thus, maternal lipid concentrations may exert in-utero influences on infant body composition. There may be potential to modulate infant body composition through alteration of maternal diet during pregnancy...|$|R
