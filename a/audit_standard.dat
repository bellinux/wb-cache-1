40|$|An audit was {{undertaken}} in 2009 {{to determine the}} success of the new national orthodontic referral protocol introduced to the Health Service Executive (HSE) in 2007 and operated in the Dublin Mid-Leinster HSE region. It was repeated in 2011 to determine if the HSE austerity measures have had a bearing on the orthodontic service performance in the Dublin Mid-Leinster HSE region. The audit also measured the success of referring practitioners in identifying the correct Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) classification of the patient. In the 2011 audit, the figures were broken down to identify the occlusal variables that caused dental practitioners most difficulties in identification. The audit demonstrates a good referral to assessment timeframe in 2009 (85 - 80 % compliance for IOTN 5 and 4 within three to six months, respectively), which deteriorates significantly in 2011 (26 - 4 % for IOTN 5 and 4 within three to six months, respectively). The ability of dentists to identify the correct IOTN classification was better in 2009 (60 % correct) compared to 2011 (51 % correct), but both figures fell below the <b>audit</b> <b>standard</b> of 75 % of referrals with correct IOTN classifications. The IOTN occlusal dental health components most readily identified by referring practitioners and meeting audit standards were 5 a (overjet > 9 mm), 5 i (impacted teeth) and 5 h (extensive hypodontia). The remaining occlusal dental health components in the HSE IOTN fell below the <b>audit</b> <b>standard.</b> The audit clearly identifies a requirement for a continued educational effort to maintain the HSE IOTN skill base in primary care, and a need for additional resources to manage the demand for orthodontic assessments...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} the negotiating positions, or preferences over <b>auditing</b> <b>standards,</b> of the interest groups that may set such standards or negotiate changes in <b>standards.</b> We represent <b>auditing</b> <b>standards</b> by two properties: toughness and vagueness (or lack of precision). Our model predicts that auditors and investors would consider both toughness and vagueness to influence or set <b>auditing</b> <b>standards</b> (e. g., preference over vague-ness depends {{on the level of}} toughness.) Since the market is composed with auditors with different wealth and different investment projects, the optimal level of standards would be different for these parties. Therefore, in general, <b>auditing</b> <b>standards</b> with a certain level of vagueness is preferred. By analyzing economic incentives in the process of setting <b>auditing</b> <b>standards,</b> we help explain how the standards have developed into their current form. ∗We greatly appreciate the advice from Kin Lo, Hugh Neary, and Sandra Chamberlain.
