40|$|The current {{approach}} {{of a system}} of two bodies that interact through a gravitational force goes beyond the familiar ex positions [1 - 3] and derives some interesting features and laws that are overlooked. A new expression for the angular momentum of a system in terms of the angular momenta of its parts is deduced. It is shown that the characteristics of the relative motion depend on the system’s total mass, whereas the characteristics of the individual motions depend on the masses of the two bodies. The reduced energy and angular momentum densities are constants of motion that do not depend on the distribution of the total mass between the two bodies; whereas the energy may vary in absolute value from an infinitesimal to a maximum value which occurs when the two bodies are of equal masses. In correspondence with infinite possible ways to describe the absolute rotational positioning of a two body system, an infinite set of Laplace-Runge-Lenz vectors (LRL) are constructed, all fixing a unique orientation of the orbit relative to the fixed stars. The common expression of LRV vector is an approximation of the actual one. The conditions for nested and intersect ing individual orbits of the two bodies are specified.

40|$|Bridge Glacier is a lake-calving glacier in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia and has retreated over 3. 55  km since 1972. The {{majority}} of this retreat has occurred since 1991. This retreat is substantially greater than {{what has been}} inferred from regional climate indices, suggesting {{that it has been}} driven primarily by calving as the glacier retreated across an overdeepened basin. In order to better understand the primary drivers of ablation, surface melt (below the equilibrium line altitude, ELA) and calving were quantified during the 2013 melt season using a distributed energy balance model (DEBM) and time-lapse imagery. Calving, estimated using <b>areal</b> change, <b>velocity</b> measurements, and assuming flotation were responsible for 23  % of the glacier's ablation below the ELA during the 2013 melt season and were limited by modest flow speeds and a small terminus cross-section. Calving and surface melt estimates from 1984 to 2013 suggest that calving was consistently a smaller contributor of ablation. Although calving was estimated to be responsible for up to 49  % of the glacier's ablation for individual seasons, averaged over multiple summers it accounted between 10  and 25  %. Calving was enhanced primarily by buoyancy and water depths, and fluxes were greatest between 2005 and 2010 as the glacier retreated over the deepest part of Bridge Lake. The recent rapid rate of calving is part of a transient stage in the glacier's retreat and is expected to diminish within 10 years as the terminus recedes into shallower water at the proximal end of the lake. These findings are in line with observations from other lake-calving glacier studies across the globe and suggest a common large-scale pattern in calving-induced retreat in lake-terminating alpine glaciers. Despite enhancing glacial retreat, calving remains a relatively small component of ablation and is expected to decrease in importance in the future. Hence, surface melt remains the primary driver of ablation at Bridge Glacier and thus projections of future retreat should be more closely tied to climate...|$|R
40|$|The mass (volume and <b>areal</b> densities) versus <b>{{velocity}}</b> {{as well as}} {{the size}} versus velocity distributions of a shock-induced cloud of particles are investigated using large scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A generic 3 D tin crystal with a sinusoidal free surface roughness (single wavelength) is set in contact with vacuum and shock-loaded so that it melts directly on shock. At the reflection of the shock wave onto the perturbations of the free surface, 2 D sheets/jets of liquid metal are ejected. The simulations show that the distributions may be described by an analytical model based on the propagation of a fragmentation zone, from the tip of the sheets to the free surface, within which the kinetic energy of the atoms decreases as this zone comes closer to the free surface on late times. As this kinetic energy drives (i) the (self-similar) expansion of the zone once it has broken away from the sheet and (ii) the average size of the particles which result from fragmentation in the zone, the ejected mass and the average size of the particles progressively increase in the cloud as fragmentation occurs closer to the free surface. Though relative to nanometric scales, our model reproduces quantitatively experimental profiles and may help in their analysis.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} <b>areal</b> <b>velocity</b> is closely linked {{historically}} {{with the concept}} of angular momentum. Kepler's second law states that the <b>areal</b> <b>velocity</b> of a planet, with the sun taken as origin, is constant. Isaac Newton was the first scientist to recognize the dynamical significance of Kepler's second law. With the aid of his laws of motion, he proved in 1684 that any planet that is attracted to a fixed center sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. By the middle of the 18th century, the principle of angular momentum was discovered gradually by Daniel Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler and Patrick d'Arcy; d'Arcy's version of the principle was phrased in terms of swept area. For this reason, the principle of angular momentum was often referred to in the older literature in mechanics as [...] "the principle of areas." [...] Since the concept of angular momentum includes more than just geometry, the designation [...] "principle of areas" [...] has been dropped in modern works.|$|E
5000|$|The {{constancy}} of <b>areal</b> <b>velocity</b> may {{be illustrated}} by uniform circular and linear motion. In uniform circular motion, the particle moves with constant speed v around {{the circumference of}} {{a circle of radius}} r. Since the angular velocity ω = v/r is constant, the area swept out in a time Δt equals ω r2Δt; hence, equal areas are swept out in equal times Δt. In uniform linear motion (i.e., motion {{in the absence of a}} force, by Newtons first law of motion), the particle moves with constant velocity, that is, with constant speed v along a line. In a time Δt, the particle sweeps out an area ½vΔtr⊥ (the impact parameter). [...] The distance r⊥ does not change as the particle moves along the line; it represents the distance of closest approach of the line to the center O (the impact parameter). Since the speed v is likewise unchanging, the <b>areal</b> <b>velocity</b> ½vr⊥ is a constant of motion; the particle sweeps out equal areas in equal times.|$|E

In 1739 d'Arcy was sent abroad by his parents to an uncle in Paris. He was tutored in mathematics by Jean-Baptiste Clairaut, and became a friend of Jean-Baptiste's son, Alexis-Claude Clairaut, (Alexis Clairaut), who was a brilliant young mathematician. d'Arcy made original contributions to dynamics. He {{is best known for his}} part in the discovery of the principle of angular momentum, in a form which was known as [...] "the principle of areas," [...] which he announced in 1746. See the article on <b>areal</b> <b>velocity.</b> d'Arcy also had an illustrious military career in the French army. He obtained the title of [...] "Count" [...] in the French nobility. He was a generous patron of Irish refugees in France. In addition to his contributions to dynamics, he performed research on artillery and on electricity. An experiment of his, reported in 1765, on visual perception is often referred to: it involved a rotating disk on which a burning coal was placed; when the disk was spun at an angular velocity exceeding seven revolutions per second, a full circle of light was perceived. This and other experiments makes d'Arcy first person to demonstrate the illusion of a moving image; although Joseph Plateau greatly elaborated on this initial finding. d'Arcy was elected to the Academie Royale des Sciences in 1749. He died from cholera in Paris in October 1779.|$|E

We learn how gravity is an irrotational aether flow that is permeated with tiny swirling sinks that siphon the aether away from the larger sink. These tiny swirling sinks are stacked {{on top of each}} other in their axial planes so as to form the double helixes that constitute Faraday’s lines of force. The magnetic permeability represents the areal density in the equatorial plane of these vortices and hence it represents the flux density of a bundle of Faraday’s lines of force measured perpendicularly to the lines. Magnetic permeability and electric permittivity both represent a leakage factor in the gravitational field...|$|E

Indeed attempts to solve it have ranged from those devoid of science but fairly accurate to those based on some physical principle (s) but rather inaccurate, such as Berlage's and 0. Schmidt's theories. The problem of planetary motions was first tackled by Eudoxus, who proposed rotating tilted concentric spheres, rather like a gyroscope, to explain each planet. When Kepler solved the problem of their motions {{with the concept of}} <b>areal</b> <b>velocity,</b> the area swept out in an invariable plane divided by the time is a constant, the problem of a law for their spacing remained. Indeed, I think the unit of angular momentun should be named after Kepler for his contribution of area as a vector.

40|$|Transparent {{mesoporous}} TiO 2 (M-TiO 2) {{thin films}} were prepared on quartz via a reverse micelle, sol-gel, spin-coating technique. Films {{were characterized by}} atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman and UV-vis spectroscopies and {{were found to be}} mostly anatase with low surface roughness (Rt approximate to 5 nm). The time dependence of film photoinduced superhydrophilicity (PISH) was measured by observation of the spreading of a sessile water drop using a new, continuous measurement technique wherein the drop was first applied to the semiconductor surface and then was filmed while it and the underlying substrate were illuminated by 315 nm ultraband gap light. Results obtained at 100 % relative humidity (RH) at 293 K showed that drops on M-TiO 2 surfaces exhibited a photoinduced "stick-slip" behavior, the first time such an effect has been observed. The thermodynamic driving force for this photoinduced stick-slip was the departure of the system from capillary equilibrium as, with increasing illumination time, the concentration of surface Ti-OH groups increased and the equilibrium contact angle of the drop, theta(0), decreased. A simple theoretical description of photoinduced stick-slip is derived and is used to calculate a value of the potential energy barrier associated with surface inhomogeneities that oppose onset of movement of the triple line, U = 6. 63 x 10 (- 6) J m(- 1). This {{is the first time that}} U has been quantified for a surface with photoinduced superhydrophilicity. Triple line retreat measurements on an evaporating drop on M-TiO 2 in the dark, RH = 60 %, T = 293 K, gave a value of U = 9. 4 x 10 (- 6) J m(- 1), indicating that U decreases upon UV illumination and that U in the light is primarily associated with inhomogeneities that are unaffected by an increase in the surface Ti-OH population, such as the physical roughness of the surface. In the dark evaporation experiment, the drop was found to retreat with an <b>areal</b> <b>velocity</b> of 1. 48 x 10 (- 8) m(2) s(- 1). However, under UV illumination, the drop was found to spread at a substantially faster velocity of 2. 33 x 10 (- 5) m(2) s(- 1), the latter being of the order of the velocities of 10 (- 4) m(2) s(- 1) observed in (dark) drop-spreading experiments conducted in the presence of trisiloxane surfactant superspreaders. This suggests that, once slip has started, the triple line processes over a thin precursor film of condensed water whose formation has been promoted by the photoinduced increase in the Ti-OH population at the semiconductor surface...|$|E

Smaldone, [URL] The three Kepler’s laws are addressed {{in the case of the}} planets of the solar system. The visualization of the planets’ motions, the surrounding stars and the Milky Way are based on real data and images. The polar projection (fish-eye format) allows to observe the full hemisphere of the sky. The time counters measure the time in Universal Time (U. T.). Pedagogical Effectiveness and Transformation Potential. These keywords summarise the educational contributions offered by “Eyes on Kepler Laws” in addressing some learning/teaching problems commonly encountered by students and teachers when the Kepler’s laws are studied (e. g. meaning of each law, similarities and differences in the planets’ orbits, evaluation of revolution periods, areal vs orbital velocity, etc.). Two historical portraits show Tycho Brahe (1546 – 1601) and Johannes Kepler (1571 – 1630) together with the first edition of Quadrans Muralis (1598) and Astronomia nova (1609), Harmonices Mundi (1619). These allude to the great power of abstraction of the work by Kepler, based on the analysis of very many and much accurate observations by Tycho Brahe. The connection between the orbits of the 8 planets in the solar system and their abstract representations as visualization of the orbits (dynamic display) can help the learners familiarise with these phenomena. The used planetarium images together with the possibilities of various viewpoints and scale changes (zooming in/out) produce a context very close to reality and much richer then that of a simulation based only on mathematical models. It is therefore possible to discuss power and limits of a model, approximations, graphic displays, etc… The Kepler First Law and the difficulty in understanding the different eccentricity of elliptical orbits is addressed by visualising Mercury, Venus and Earth orbits, the last two being almost circular while the first is clearly elliptical. The Second Law is clarified by analysing the motion of Mercury, with special focus on its position and velocity near perihelion and aphelion. The constancy of <b>areal</b> <b>velocity</b> can be checked be measuring the area swept off in four days of Mercury revolution (PM = 88 days). The Third Law is addressed via the examples of Mercury and Venus; the periods and semi-axes of their dynamically shown orbits are measured and related. The two planets move on the real background of a steady Milky Way and the moving Earth and Mars. The well acknowledged Predict – Observe - Explain (POE) learning cycle can be easily implemented. The learners are initially asked to predict features of the motion of various solar planets; then the multimedia is used and the learners explain, with their words (orally or in writing) the results of their observations. The comparison between the P and O phases of the cycle allows to address possible learning difficulties. Iteration of the POE cycle facilitate both spiralling around Kepler’s Laws and addressing their content at diverse depth. Eyes on Kepler Laws can be used for class activities, home work, tasks and problem-based learning. It is also appropriate in teacher’s education programs...|$|E
