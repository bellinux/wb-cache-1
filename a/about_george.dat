5|$|Alongside {{the second}} series of Life Begins, Bullen {{continued}} developing George the Third. The title {{was changed to}} It Happens until eventually settling on All <b>About</b> <b>George</b> in time for filming in 2005. All <b>About</b> <b>George</b> starred Rik Mayall as George Kinsey, a builder whose life is changed when six generations of his family move into his home. Initially excited about the series when he attended the cast read-throughs, Bullen's optimism waned {{by the time it}} was broadcast as he felt there were too many characters and the series' premise unclear. In a 2008 interview, he describes it as one of his worst TV series. Life Begins returned for a third and final series in 2006. The same year, filming commenced on Tripping Over, a series about intercontinental backpackers in 1976 and 2006. SeaChange writers Andrew Knight and Andrea Denholm conceived the idea in 2003 and asked Bullen, a friend of Knight's, to develop it with them. A co-production between Australia's Channel Ten and Britain's Five, Tripping Over was broadcast in both countries at the end of 2006.|$|E
5|$|Seidler read <b>about</b> <b>George</b> VI's {{life after}} {{overcoming}} a stuttering condition he endured during his youth. He started {{writing about the}} relationship between the therapist and his royal patient as early as the 1980s, but {{at the request of the}} King's widow, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, postponed work until her death in 2002. He later rewrote his screenplay for the stage to focus on the essential relationship between the two protagonists. Nine weeks before filming began, Logue's notebooks were discovered and quotations from them were incorporated into the script.|$|E
5|$|In 1995 he {{commissioned}} a comedy drama on spec from Mike Bullen, a BBC radio producer and first-time writer. Like An Evening with Gary Lineker, The Perfect Match was based around football and received respectable reviews. Harries {{was interested in}} producing more comedy dramas, based {{on the success of}} American programmes like Thirtysomething, and assigned Granada producer Christine Langan to work with Bullen. Langan and Bullen developed Cold Feet, which was broadcast in 1997 and was commissioned for a full series in 1998. It won the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series in 2002, which Harries collected with Bullen and Spencer Campbell. Harries executive produced two more series of Bullen's; Life Begins (2004–2006) and All <b>About</b> <b>George</b> (2005).|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the public}} blamed Ernest for Sellis's death. The more extreme Whig papers, anti-royal pamphleteers, and caricaturists all offered nefarious {{explanations}} for Sellis's death, in which the Duke was to blame. Some stories had the Duke cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis killed for finding Ernest and Mrs. Sellis in bed together. Others suggested that the Duke was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had {{played a part in}} the death. Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who wrote books <b>about</b> <b>George</b> III's children, ascribe part of the animus and fear towards the Duke {{to the fact that he}} did not conduct love affairs in public, as did his older brothers. According to them, the public feared what vices might be going on behind the locked doors of the Duke's house, and assumed the worst.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony <b>about</b> <b>George</b> Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Haakon Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised {{on the witness stand}} with transcripts of these, which he had not been given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of any crime.|$|E

Many American Jews disagreed with the Middle East policies of the Carter administration.|$|E
25|$|At the reception, various {{patrons and}} curators congratulate George {{on his work}} while George flits among them, commenting on the {{difficulties}} of producing modern art ("Putting It Together"). Like his great-grandfather, he conjures his surroundings, allowing himself to hold multiple conversations at once. The only voice he finds he cannot ignore is that of an art critic who advises him that he is repeating himself and wasting his gifts. After the museum's patrons have left for dinner, Marie speaks to her mother's image in the painting, worrying <b>about</b> <b>George.</b> When he arrives to take her home, she tells him about her mother, attempting to pass on a message about the legacy we leave behind ("Children and Art"). She dozes off and George, alone with the painting, realizes he is lacking connection.|$|E
25|$|This {{bibliography}} of George Washington {{is a comprehensive}} list of written and published works <b>about</b> <b>George</b> Washington, first President of the United States, his life in general or in part and includes primary sources containing Washington's works, letters, records, diaries, etc. The literature on Washington is immense, his biographers and editors having lived in four separate centuries. Many of the publications listed here lend themselves to Washington in a biographical capacity, while many cover specific events and other topics where Washington is the central or an important figure. Publications covering subjects such as 'The Winter at Valley Forge', 'The Battle of Brooklyn' and Washington's farewell address are well placed {{and can be found}} in this bibliography. Washington was diligent about keeping records, maintained many dairies throughout his adult life, and corresponded with many prominent figures, family members and friends. At this late date nearly all of Washington's writings have been studied, transcribed, organized, edited and published by a good number of historians over the years, providing the basis by which the many biographical accounts of Washington's life have been written.|$|E

[...] In response to his comments, the Anti-Defamation League stated: [...] "There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government." [...] On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that [...] "I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant.

500|$|Michael J. Bullen (born 13 January 1960) is an English screenwriter. Bullen {{grew up in}} the West Midlands of England, {{attending}} the Solihull School and later Magdalene College, Cambridge. He left with a degree in history of art and became a radio producer for the BBC World Service. Unhappy with the quality of British television targeted at people his age, Bullen took a course in screenwriting and developed a one-off comedy drama for Granada Television. This led to the commissioning of Cold Feet, a multiple-award-winning comedy drama that aired on the ITV network from 1998 to 2003. The series won Bullen the Writer of the Year award at the 2003 British Comedy Awards. He wrote two more series for Granada; Life Begins, which ran for three years, and All <b>About</b> <b>George,</b> which ran for only one. His works have been described as being [...] "about the intricacies of interpersonal relationships and what happens when they break down".|$|E

News from the ship and news received by radio were in the single-sheet newspaper.

The newspaper pages, printed on a shipboard press, measured about [...] The newspaper's motto: [...] "We Cannot Tell a Lie".

The works expanded {{over the next few}} years, developing Henry Cort's puddling process, to become the largest ironworks in the world by 1806.|$|R
