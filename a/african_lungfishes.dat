50|$|<b>African</b> <b>lungfishes</b> breed at the {{beginning}} of the rainy season. They construct nests or burrows in the mud to hold their eggs, which they then guard against predators. When they hatch, the young resemble tadpoles, with external gills, and only later develop lungs and begin to breathe air.|$|E
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>lungfishes</b> are elongated, eel-like fishes, with thread-like {{pectoral}} and pelvic fins. They have soft scales, and the dorsal {{and tail}} fins are fused {{into a single}} structure. They can either swim like eels, or crawl along the bottom, using their pectoral and pelvic fins. The largest species reach about 200 cm long.|$|E
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>lungfishes</b> {{generally}} inhabit shallow waters, such as {{swamps and}} marshes; however, {{they are also}} found in larger lakes such as Lake Victoria. They can live out of water for many months in burrows of hardened mud beneath a dried-up stream bed. They are carnivorous, eating crustaceans, aquatic insect larvae, and molluscs.|$|E

50|$|Like other <b>African</b> <b>lungfish,</b> the West <b>African</b> <b>lungfish</b> is an obligate air {{breather}} and a freshwater-dwelling fish. It is demersal, {{meaning that it}} lives primarily buried within riverbeds. Due to the dry season frequently drying the rivers and floodplains in which it lives, the West <b>African</b> <b>lungfish</b> can aestivate {{for up to a}} year; however the West <b>African</b> <b>lungfish</b> generally only estivates between wet seasons.|$|R
50|$|The gilled <b>African</b> <b>lungfish</b> (Protopterus amphibius), {{also known}} as the East <b>African</b> <b>lungfish,</b> is a species of <b>African</b> <b>lungfish.</b> It is found in swamps and flood plains of East Africa, where {{positively}} identified from Kenya, Somalia and Mozambique. Records from Tanzania require confirmation and {{may be the result of}} introductions.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>lungfishes</b> are obligate air breathers, {{with reduced}} gills in the adults. They have two {{anterior}} gill arches that retain gills, {{though they are}} too small to function as the sole respiratory apparatus. The lungfish heart has adaptations that partially separate the flow of blood into its pulmonary and systemic circuits. The atrium is partially divided, so that the left side receives oxygenated blood and the right side receives deoxygenated blood from the other tissues. These two blood streams remain mostly separate as they flow through the ventricle leading to the gill arches. As a result, oxygenated blood mostly goes to the anterior gill arches and the deoxygenated blood mostly goes to the posterior arches.|$|E
50|$|The {{immature}} lungfish is {{spotted with}} gold {{on a black}} background; in the adult, this fades to a brown or gray color. Its tooth-bearing premaxillary and maxillary bones are fused as in all Dipnoi. South American lungfish also share an autostylic jaw suspension (where the palatoquadrate is fused to the cranium) and powerful adductor jaw muscles with the extant Dipnoi. Like the <b>African</b> <b>lungfishes,</b> this species has an elongated, almost eel-like body. It may reach a length of 125 cm. The pectoral fins are thin and thread-like, while the pelvic fins are somewhat larger, and set far back. The fins {{are connected to the}} shoulder by a single bone, which is a marked difference from most fish, whose fins usually have at least four bones at their base; and a marked similarity with nearly all land-dwelling vertebrates. The gills are greatly reduced and essentially non-functional in the adults.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the South American and <b>African</b> <b>lungfishes,</b> the Australian {{species has}} gills {{on all the}} first four gill arches, while the fifth arch bears a hemibranch. It is also the only facultative air {{breather}} lungfish species, only breathing air when oxygen in the water {{is not sufficient to}} meet their needs. The lung is a single long sac situated above and extending the length of the body cavity, and is formed by a ventral outgrowth of the gut. Internally, the lung is divided into two distinct lobes that interconnect along its length, compartmentalized by the infolding of the walls.Each compartment is further divided to form a spongy alveolar region. Blood capillaries run through this region close enough to the air space in the lung to enable gas exchange. Lungfish breathe in using a buccal force-pump similar to that of amphibians. The contraction of smooth muscles in the walls of the lung results in exhalation.|$|E

40|$|Recently, minimal and {{non-invasive}} {{tools for}} organismic physiology like MR imaging and spectroscopy (NMR) {{became more and}} more available in zoological physiology. These techniques have opened a broad window of applications in comparative physiology. For example, we could show that in vivo MR imaging and spectroscopy techniques adequately monitor the effects of long-term anoxia (up to 11 days) on circulatory performance, cellular energy metabolism and acid-base regulation in freshwater turtles (Trachemys scripta). In another project, tissue oxygenation and blood flow were studied together with energy metabolism and acid-base regulation in ground squirrels during hibernatation and arousal. <b>African</b> <b>lungfishes</b> (Protopterus spp.) undergo aestivation during dry periods. Recently, P. spp. were successfully brought into aestivation after building a dried mucous cocoon inside a plastic container (Chew et al. 2004). This set-up was used to investigate aestivating lungfish under normoxia and hypoxia in a MRI scanner by monitoring high-energy phosphates and intracellular pH through in vivo 31 P-NMR spectroscopy over a time period of 12 days. Large changes occurred in phosphodiester concentrations during transition to aestivation, indicating dramatic changes in cellular membrane properties. Chew et al. (2004). J. Exp.

40|$|The extant lungfish, {{including}} three genera, the Australian, South American and <b>African</b> <b>lungfishes,</b> retain a dentition that appeared {{first in the}} Devonian, {{in some of the}} oldest members of this group. The dentition consists of permanent tooth plates with persistent cusps that appear early in development of the fish. The cusps, separate early in development, form ridges that are arranged in a radiating pattern, and fusion of the cusps {{to each other and to}} the underlying jaw bone produces a tooth plate. The lungfish dentition is based on a template of mantle dentine that surrounds bone trabeculae enclosed in the tooth plate. The mantle layer is covered by enamel. In most derived dipnoans, this framework encloses two further forms of dentine, known as interdenteonal and circumdenteonal dentines. The tooth plates grow in area and in depth without evidence of macroscopic resorption of dentines or of enamel. Increase in size and changes in shape of lungfish tooth plates is actually achieved by a process involving microscopic remodelling of the bone contained within the margin of each tooth plate, and the later addition of new dentines and enamel within and around the bone. This is accomplished without creating weakness in the structural integrity of the tooth plate and bone complex, and proceeds in line with growth and remodelling of the jaw bones attached to the tooth plates...|$|E
40|$|The {{sharpness}} {{and thus}} information {{content of the}} retinal image in the eye depends on the optical quality of the lens and its accurate positioning in the eye. Multifocal lenses create well-focused color images and {{are present in the}} eyes of all vertebrate groups studied to date (mammals, reptiles including birds, amphibians, and ray-finned fishes) and occur even in lampreys, i. e., the most basal vertebrates with well-developed eyes. Results from photoretinoscopy obtained in this study indicate that the Dipnoi (lungfishes), i. e., the closest piscine relatives to tetrapods, also possess multifocal lenses. Suspension of the lens is complex and sophisticated in teleosts (bony fishes) and tetrapods. We studied lens suspension using light and electron microscopy in one species of lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) and two species of African lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus aethiopicus and Protopterus annectens annectens). A fibrous and highly transparent membrane suspends the lens in both of these phylogenetically widely separated vertebrate groups. The membrane attaches to the lens approximately along the lens equator, from where it extends to the ora retinalis. The material forming the membrane is similar in ultrastructure to microfibrils in the zonule fibers of tetrapods. The membrane, possibly in conjunction with the cornea, iris, and vitreous body, seems suitable for keeping the lens in the correct position for well-focused imaging. Suspension of the lens by a multitude of zonule fibers in tetrapods may have evolved from a suspensory membrane similar to that in extant <b>African</b> <b>lungfishes,</b> a structure that seems to have appeared first in the lamprey-like ancestors of allextant vertebrates...|$|E

40|$|<b>African</b> <b>lungfishes</b> are ammonotelic in water. They can aestivate {{for long}} periods on land during drought. During aestivation, the gills are covered with dried mucus and ammonia {{excretion}} ceases. In fishes, ammonia excretion through the gills involves Rhesus glycoproteins (RhGP/Rhgp). This study aimed to obtain the complete cDNA coding sequences of rhgp from the gills of Protopterus annectens, and to determine their branchial mRNA and protein expression levels during the induction, maintenance and arousal phases of aestivation. Three isoforms of rhgp (rhag, rhbg and rhcg) were obtained in the gills of P. annectens. Their complete cDNA coding sequences ranged between 1311 and 1398 bp, coding for 436 to 465 amino acids with estimated molecular masses between 46. 8 and 50. 9 kDa. Dendrogramic analyses indicated that Rhag was grouped closer to fishes, while Rhbg and Rhcg were grouped closer to tetrapods. During the induction phase, the protein abundance of Rhag, but not its transcript level, was down-regulated in the gills, suggesting {{that there could be}} a decrease in the release of ammonia from the erythrocytes to the plasma. Furthermore, the branchial transcript levels of rhbg and rhcg decreased significantly, in preparation for the subsequent shutdown of gill functions. During the maintenance phase, the branchial expression levels of rhag/Rhag, rhbg/Rhbg and rhcg/Rhcg decreased significantly, indicating that their transcription and translation were down-regulated. This could be part of an overall mechanism to shut down branchial functions and save metabolic energy used for transcription and translation. It could also be regarded as an adaptive response to stop ammonia excretion. During the arousal phase, it is essential for the lungfish to regain the ability to excrete ammonia. Indeed, the protein abundance of Rhag, Rhbg and Rhcg recovered to the corresponding control levels after 1 day or 3 days of recovery from 6 months of aestivation...|$|E

40|$|<b>African</b> <b>lungfishes</b> can undergo {{long periods}} of {{aestivation}} on land during drought. During aestivation, lungfishes are confronted with desiccation and dehydration, and their gills become non-functional {{and covered with a}} thick layer of dried mucus. Aquaporins (Aqps) are a superfamily of integral membrane proteins which generally facilitate the permeation of water through plasma membranes. This study aimed to obtain the complete cDNA coding sequences of aqp 1 and aqp 3 from the gills of Protopterus annectens, and to determine their branchial mRNA and protein expression levels during the induction, maintenance and arousal phases of aestivation. Dendrogramic analyses of the deduced Aqp 1 and Aqp 3 amino acid sequences of P. annectens revealed their close relationships with those of Latimeria chalumnae and tetrapods. During the induction phase, there were significant decreases in the transcript levels of aqp 1 and aqp 3 in the gills of P. annectens, but the branchial Aqp 1 and Aqp 3 protein abundance remained unchanged. As changes in transcription may precede changes in translation, this could be regarded as an adaptive response to decrease the protein abundance of Aqp 1 and Aqp 3 in the subsequent maintenance phase of aestivation. As expected, the branchial transcript levels and protein abundance of aqp 1 /Aqp 1 and aqp 3 /Aqp 3 were significantly down-regulated during the maintenance phase, probably attributable to the shutdown of branchial functions and the cessation of volume regulation of branchial epithelial cells. Additionally, these changes could reduce the loss of water through branchial epithelial surfaces, supplementing the anti-desiccating property of the dried mucus. Upon arousal, it was essential for the lungfish to restore branchial functions. Indeed, the protein abundance of Aqp 1 recovered partially, with complete recovery of mRNA expression level and protein abundance of Aqp 3, in the gills of P. annectens. These results provide insights into how P. annectens regulates branchial Aqp expression to cope with desiccation and rehydration during different phases of aestivation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract OnlyCulture of {{resilient}} {{species to}} drought and stressed water quality conditions {{may be a}} significant part of the future of African aquaculture. Air breathing fishes potentially have a role in low-management culture systems because dissolved oxygen is not a limiting factor. The <b>African</b> <b>lungfish</b> (Protopterus spp) is advantageous because it is an indigenous fish with good quality flesh, an air-breather and a biocontrol agent against schistosome vector snails. Little is known about indigenous practices of culture, harvest, and marketing of Protopterus spp from farm ponds and water bodies. This study assessed the status and potential of lungfish aquaculture in Uganda in seven districts in Kampala, Wakiso, Kumi, Busia, Soroti, Pallisa and Jinja. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders; fish farmers, fisher folk communities, Fisheries officers, scientists, fish traders, and consumers.
