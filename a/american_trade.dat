5|$|Tensions between Britain and the United States {{escalated}} {{again during}} the Napoleonic Wars, as Britain tried to cut off <b>American</b> <b>trade</b> with France and boarded American ships to impress men into the Royal Navy. The US declared war, the War of 1812, and invaded Canadian territory. In response Britain invaded the US, but the pre-war boundaries were reaffirmed by the 1814 Treaty of Ghent, ensuring Canada's future would be separate {{from that of the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|The trade's {{boom years}} ended around 1810, after which a long decline {{was marked by}} {{increasing}} economic diversification. By 1810, the supply of sea otter pelts had fallen due to overhunting. <b>American</b> <b>trade</b> declined during the War of 1812, but after 1815, Americans were able to resume and expand the maritime fur trade, and continued to dominate.|$|E
5|$|Although in speeches Seward had {{predicted}} all of North America joining the Union, he had, as a senator, opposed the Gadsden Purchase obtaining land from Mexico, and Buchanan's attempts to purchase Cuba from Spain. Those stands were likely because {{the land to}} be secured might become slave territory. After the Civil War, this {{was no longer an}} issue, and Seward became an ardent expansionist and even contemplated the purchase of Greenland and Iceland. The Union Navy had been hampered {{due to the lack of}} overseas bases during the war, and Seward also believed that <b>American</b> <b>trade</b> would be helped by the purchase of overseas territory.|$|E

5|$|The British {{agreed to}} depart from their forts around the Great Lakes, and the United States-Canada {{boundary}} had to be re-adjusted. Numerous pre-Revolutionary debts were liquidated, and the British opened their West Indies colonies to <b>American</b> <b>trade.</b> Most importantly, the treaty delayed war with Great Britain and instead brought a decade of prosperous trade. The treaty angered the French and became a central issue in many political debates. Relations with France deteriorated after the treaty was signed, leaving succeeding president John Adams {{with the prospect of}} war.|$|E
5|$|The Great Western Railway {{originated}} from {{the desire of}} Bristol merchants to maintain their city as the second port {{of the country and}} the chief one for <b>American</b> <b>trade.</b> The increase in the size of ships and the gradual silting of the River Avon had made Liverpool an increasingly attractive port, and with a Liverpool to London rail line under construction in the 1830s Bristol's status was threatened. The answer for Bristol was, with the co-operation of London interests, to build a line of their own; a railway built to unprecedented standards of excellence to out-perform the lines being constructed to the North West of England.|$|E

Polk had vowed to resolve.|$|E

5|$|Another side {{trade was}} {{smuggling}} along the Pacific {{coast of the}} Spanish Empire, where foreign trade was prohibited by Spanish law. This trade peaked in the 1810s, then faded in the 1820s. Traders concentrated on Alta California, which produced a surplus of grain, beef, tallow, and hides, but was chronically short of manufactured goods. American ships brought goods to the missions of Alta California in exchange for grain, beef, and Californian sea otter skins. The grain, beef, and other provisions were taken to Sitka, which was perennially short of foods supplies. After Mexico gained independence in 1821 the <b>American</b> <b>trade</b> with Alta California continued in a slightly modified form. American traders brought mostly clothing, cottons, silks, lace, cutlery, alcohol, and sugar, which were traded for hides and tallow at a profit generally between 200% and 300%. The California Hide Trade became a major industry in its own right. By the 1830s, however, the missions of Alta California had been secularized by Mexican authorities and deserted by Indian labourers. The trade slid into unprofitability. The decline of the <b>American</b> <b>trade</b> with Alta California left just one significant alternative to the ever-dwindling sea otter trade—the provisioning of the settlements of Russian America, which lasted until the Americans abandoned the North West Coast altogether in the early 1840s. From {{the first decade of}} the 19th century until 1841 American ships visited Sitka regularly, trading provisions, textiles, and liquor for fur seal skins, timber, and fish. This trade was usually highly profitable for the Americans and the Russian settlements depended on it. Thus when Tsar NicholasI issued the ukase of 1821, banning foreign trade north of the 51st parallel, the Russian colonies in America were forced to ignore the ban and engage in smuggling.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, FES {{accounted}} for around 5 per cent of all Guinness production, with two thirds destined for Australia and the United States, where it was largely used as a medicinal product. Australia remained the single largest export market for the product until 1910, when it was eclipsed by the United States. Due to the expense of importation, FES was a premium product, selling for double the price of domestic stouts. By 1912, total production had reached 105,000 hogsheads. The <b>American</b> <b>trade</b> was disrupted by the onset of World War I and then discontinued entirely with the introduction of Prohibition. The product was not popular when it returned in the 1930s, as drinkers now preferred the lighter and cheaper Guinness Extra Stout. Following discontinuation of export during World War II, FES did not return to the United States until 1956, but this was not successful, and the beer was withdrawn shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The British Hudson's Bay Company {{was formed}} in 1670 to {{capitalize}} on the Native American fur trade near Hudson Bay. The company came to dominate the North <b>American</b> <b>trade</b> in the 18th century. The North West Company of Montreal {{was formed in}} 1779 to compete with Hudson's Bay Company establishing their western headquarters and key exchange point at Grand Portage in what is now Minnesota. Grand Portage, with its two wharves and numerous warehouses, became one of Britain's four main fur trading posts, along with Niagara, Detroit, and Michilimackinac. British ships crossed Lake Superior regularly transporting supplies to the region and bringing back valuable furs. Even after Grand Portage became property of the U.S. in 1783 the British operations, such as North West Company and the XY Company, continued to operate in the area for some time.|$|E

5|$|During the Industrial Revolution, Scotland {{became one}} of the {{commercial}} and industrial centres of the British Empire. With tariffs with England now abolished, the potential for trade for Scottish merchants was considerable, especially with Colonial America. However, the economic benefits of union were very slow to appear, primarily because Scotland was too poor to exploit the opportunities of the greatly expanded free market. Scotland in 1750 was still a poor rural, agricultural society with a population of 1.3million. Some progress was visible, such as the sales of linen and cattle to England, the cash flows from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow after 1740. The clippers belonging to the Glasgow Tobacco Lords were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia. Merchants who profited from the <b>American</b> <b>trade</b> began investing in leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, sailcloth, glassworks, breweries, and soapworks, setting the foundations for the city's emergence as a leading industrial centre after 1815. The tobacco trade collapsed during the American Revolution (1776–83), when it sources were cut off by the British blockade of American ports. However, trade with the West Indies began {{to make up for the}} loss of the tobacco business, reflecting the extensive growth of the cotton industry, the British demand for sugar and the demand in the West Indies for herring and linen goods. During 1750–1815, 78 Glasgow merchants not only specialised in the importation of sugar, cotton, and rum from the West Indies, but diversified their interests by purchasing West Indian plantations, Scottish estates, or cotton mills. They were not to be self-perpetuating due to the hazards of the trade, the incident of bankruptcy, and the changing complexity of Glasgow's economy.|$|E
