25|$|Public {{opinion polls}} have {{consistently}} shown that <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> {{believe there was}} a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. Gallup polls have also found that only 20–30% of the population believe that Oswald had acted alone. These polls also {{show that there is}} no agreement on who else may have been involved.

In February and March, a Pew Research Center for the People & the Press survey found about as many adults favored (45%) as opposed (46%) allowing same-sex couples to marry legally, compared to a 2009 Pew Research survey that found just 37% backed same-sex marriage while 54% opposed. In March and April, polls by Gallup, ABC News/Washington Post, and CNN/Opinion Research all showed that <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> approved of same-sex marriage.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} of 1980 {{was a key}} turning point in American politics. It signaled the new electoral power of the suburbs and the Sun Belt. Reagan's success as a conservative would initiate a realigning of the parties, as liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats would either leave politics or change party affiliations through the 1980s and 1990s to leave the parties much more ideologically polarized. While during Barry Goldwater's 1964 campaign, many voters saw his warnings about a too-powerful government as hyperbolic and only 30% of the electorate agreed that government was too powerful, by 1980 <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> believed that government held too much power.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{argued that}} some {{politicians}} supporting the War on Terror {{are motivated by}} reasons other than those they publicly state. Others accuse those politicians of cynically misleading the public to achieve their own ends. For instance, {{in the months leading}} up to the invasion of Iraq, President Bush and members of his administration indicated that they possessed information which demonstrated a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. Published reports of the links began in late December 1998. In January 1999, Newsweek magazine published a story about Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda joining forces to attack U.S. interests in the Gulf Region. ABC News broadcast a story of this link soon after. Polls suggested that <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> believed that Saddam Hussein was linked to the attacks of September 11, 2001. However, despite shifting public opinion, the Bush Administration believed that there was the possibility of a potential collaboration between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath regime following the U.S. led invasion of Afghanistan.|$|E

Gallup polls dating back to 1944 have shown a consistent majority of the public supporting a direct vote; however, support decreased significantly in their 2016 poll, conducted {{a few weeks after the}} 2016 election, when they found support for the popular vote at 49%, an all-time low, with 47% wanting to keep the Electoral College.

50|$|As Bonomi (1971) shows, {{the most}} {{distinctive}} feature of colonial society was the vibrant political culture, which attracted {{the most talented}} and ambitious young men into politics. First, suffrage was the most generous in the world, with every man allowed to vote who owned {{a certain amount of}} property. Fewer than one-percent of British men could vote, whereas <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> freemen were eligible. The roots of democracy were present, although deference was typically shown to social elites in colonial elections.|$|R

2500|$|By {{agreeing to}} subsume its own weapons program within the Americans', {{the plan would}} have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952. Although <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> {{including}} Truman supported the proposal, several key officials, including the Atomic Energy Commission's Lewis Strauss and Senator Arthur Vandenberg, did not. Their opposition, and security concerns caused by the arrest in early 1950 of Klaus Fuchs, a Soviet spy working at Harwell, ended the negotiations in January 1950. After Britain developed atomic weapons through its own efforts, the scientist Sir Leonard Owen nonetheless stated that [...] "the McMahon Act {{was probably one of}} the best things that happened ... as it made us work and think for ourselves along independent lines." ...|$|E
