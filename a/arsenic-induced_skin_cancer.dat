Epigenetic changes, including microRNA expression changes, might be playing a role. This dissertation investigates the impact of miRNA expression changes in <b>arsenic-induced</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancer.</b> MiRNA expression was measure and compared using 3 different techniques, RTq-PCR, hybridization arrays and RNA-sequencing. MiRNAs differential expression in skin lesions was phenotype- and stage-related. Immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT) were transformed by chronic low arsenite exposure serving {{as a model for}} arsenic-induced skin carcinogenesis. Early changes in miRNAs and target mRNAs contribute to arsenic-induced carcinogenesis. Throughout the time course of arsenic exposure, dysregulation of cells’ growth and cancer-related pathways were identified. Comparisons between the miRNA profiles in lesions and cells predict some miRNAs may serve as biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for arsenic-induced tumors.

Nicotinamide (vitamin B 3) reduces premalignant keratoses in sun-damaged skin, likely by prevention of UV-induced cellular energy depletion and enhancement of DNA repair. We investigated whether nicotinamide modifies DNA repair following exposure to UV radiation and sodium arsenite. HaCaT keratinocytes and ex vivo human skin were exposed to 2 μM sodium arsenite and low dose (2 J/cm 2) solar-simulated UV, with and without nicotinamide supplementation. DNA photolesions in the form of 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 2 '-deoxyguanosine and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers were detected by immunofluorescence. Arsenic exposure significantly increased levels of 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 2 '-deoxyguanosine in irradiated cells. Nicotinamide reduced both types of photolesions in HaCaT keratinocytes and in ex vivo human skin, likely by enhancing DNA repair. These results demonstrate a reduction of two different photolesions over time in two different models in UV and arsenic exposed cells.

40|$|Long-term {{exposure}} to arsenic {{is associated with}} cancers of lung, urinary bladder, kidney, liver and skin. Arsenic car-cinogenesis might result from oxidative stress, altered growth factors, chromosomal abnormality, immune dysregula-tion, and aberrant epigenetic regulations. Bowen’s disease (As-BD) {{is the most common}} form of <b>arsenic-induces</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> and is characterized by chronicity, multiplicity, and predisposition in sun-spare skin. However, only about 1 % of the population exposed to arsenic developped <b>skin</b> <b>cancers,</b> indicating the host immune response plays an important modulatory role in skin carcinogenesis. In this review, we review the pathomechanisms of arsenic skin carcinogenesis and the immune interactions. Arsenic affects innate and adaptive immune responses through CD 4 + T cells, monocytes, macrophages, and Langerhans cells. In skin of As-BD, CD 4 + T cells undergo selective and differential apoptosis via Fas-FasL interaction. Numbers and dendrites of Langerhans cells are reduced in As-BD lesions. There is a defective homeostasis and aberrant trafficking of Langerhans cells. Such information is essential to understand the molecular mechanism for arsenic carcinogenesis in both skin and in internal organs...|$|R

We studied the presence of 8 -hydroxy- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine by immunohistochemistry using N 45. 1 monoclonal antibody in 28 cases of arsenic-related skin neoplasms and arsenic keratosis as well as in 11 cases of arsenic-unrelated Bowen’s diseases. The frequency of 8 -hydroxy- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine positive cases was significantly higher in arsenic-related skin neoplasms (22 of 28; 78 %) than in arsenic-unrelated Bowen’s disease (one of 11; 9 %) (p <[*] 0. 001 by χ 2 test). 8 -Hydroxy- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine was also detected in normal tissue adjacent to the arsenic-related Bowen’s disease lesions. Furthermore, arsenic was detected by neutron activation analysis in the deparaffined skin tumor samples of arsenic-related disease (four of five; 80 %), whereas arsenic was not detected in control samples.

This thesis investigated whether nicotinamide affected DNA repair in HaCaT keratinocytes following exposure to UV and sodium arsenite and also in melanocytes following exposure to UV. HaCaT keratinocytes and ex vivo human skin were exposed to 2 µM sodium arsenite and low dose (2 J/cm 2) UV, with and without nicotinamide supplementation. Primary melanocytes were exposed to UV alone, with or without nicotinamide. DNA photolesions in the form of 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (8 oxoG) and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers were subsequently detected by immunofluorescence. Arsenic exposure significantly increased levels of 8 oxoG in irradiated cells. Nicotinamide reduced both types of photolesions in HaCaT keratinocytes, primary melanocytes and in ex vivo human skin. These results demonstrate a reduction of two photolesions over time in two different models in UV and arsenic exposed cells.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the prevalence and multiple risk factors of <b>arsenic-induced</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> among residents in Taiwanese villages in which chronic arseniasis is hyperendemic, a total of 1571 subjects aged 30 or more years were recruited between September 1988 and March 1989.

The overall prevalence of skin cancer was as high as 6. 1 %, showing an increase with age in both men and women. There was a significant dose-response relation between skin cancer prevalence and chronic arsenic exposure as indexed by duration of residence in the endemic area, duration of consumption of high-arsenic artesian well water, average arsenic exposure in parts per million (p. p. m.) and cumulative arsenic exposure in p. p. m. -years.

40|$|Arsenic is an {{environmental}} toxin which increases skin cancer risk for exposed populations worldwide, however the biomolecular mechanism {{is yet to}} be fully elucidated. Genomewide epigenetic repatterning occurs with arsenic exposure – a process which is associated with altered gene expression and activity of epigenetic regulators.

SIRT 1 is a lysine deacetylase with a well-characterised role in mediating cellular adaptation to metabolic stress; in part, by regulating activation of the tumour suppressor p 53, and also by maintaining patterns of gene expression by regulating the activity of chromatin remodelling complexes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Individual {{variability}} in arsenic metabolism may underlie individual susceptibility toward <b>arsenic-induced</b> <b>skin</b> lesions and <b>skin</b> <b>cancer.</b> Metabolism of arsenic proceeds through sequential reduction and oxidative methylation being {{mediated by the}} following genes: purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), arsenic (+ 3) methyltransferase (As 3 MT), glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO 1), and omega 2 (GSTO 2). PNP functions as arsenate reductase; As 3 MT methylates inorganic arsenic and its metabolites; and both GSTO 1 and GSTO 2 reduce the metabolites. Alteration in functions of these gene products may lead to arsenic-specific disease manifestations. OBJECTIVES: To find any probable association between arsenicism and the exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the above-mentioned arsenic-metabolizing genes, we screened all the exons in those genes in an arsenic-exposed population. METHODS: Using polymerase chain reaction {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analysis, we screened the exons in 25 cases (individuals with <b>arsenic-induced</b> <b>skin</b> lesions) and 25 controls (individuals without <b>arsenic-induced</b> <b>skin</b> lesions), both groups drinking similar arsenic-contaminated water. The exonic SNPs identified were further genotyped in a total of 428 genetically unrelated individuals (229 cases and 199 controls) for association study. RESULTS: Among four candidate genes, PNP, As 3 MT, GSTO 1, and GSTO 2, we found that distribution of three exonic polymorphisms, His 20 His, Gly 51 Ser, and Pro 57 Pro of PNP, was associated with arsenicism.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been demonstrated that arsenic induces overexpression of keratinocyte-derived growth factors, which {{are likely to have}} a significant role in <b>arsenic-induced</b> <b>skin</b> hyperkeratoses and <b>cancer.</b> The mechanism(s) involved in this induction are, however, still elusive. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the early intracellular events that follow in[*]vitro treatment with sodium arsenate in a murine keratinocyte cell line (HEL 30), which leads to cytokine overproduction. First, we observed that sodium arsenate induced a concentration-dependent production of interleukin- 1 α and a significant increase in cell proliferation, that could be suppressed by the addition of a neutralizing antibody against murine interleukin- 1 α, confirming the ability of arsenic to induce keratinocyte growth-promoting cytokines. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that arsenate induced a dramatic alteration in keratinocyte mitochondria. This effect could be prevented by rotenone pretreatment, which suggests the possible involvement of mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species. Arsenic induced a concentration- and time-dependent increase in cellular oxidative activity, which was followed by activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κB and activator protein- 1, that are essential for interleukin- 1 α synthesis. Prior treatment with rotenone or prolonged treatment with ethidium bromide, an inhibitor of mitochondrial DNA and RNA synthesis, to deplete cells of functional mitochondria, completely prevented sodium arsenate-induced interleukin- 1 α production, this indicates the pivotal role of these organelles in sodium arsenate-induced keratinocyte growth factors...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{inorganic}} arsenic in contaminated {{drinking water}} poses an environmental public health threat {{for hundreds of}} millions of people in the US and around the world. Arsenic is a known carcinogen for skin cancer. However, the mechanism by which arsenic induces skin cancer remains poorly understood. Here, we have shown that arsenic induces p 62 expression in an autophagy-independent manner in human HaCaT keratinocytes. In mouse skin, chronic arsenic exposure through drinking water increases p 62 protein levels in the epidermis. Nrf 2 is required for basal and arsenic-induced p 62 up-regulation. p 62 knockdown reduces arsenic-induced Nrf 2 activity, and induces sustained p 21 up-regulation. p 62 induction is associated with increased proliferation in mouse epidermis. p 62 knockdown had little effect on arsenic-induced apoptosis, while it decreased cell proliferation following arsenic treatment. Our findings indicate that arsenic induces p 62 expression to regulate the Nrf 2 pathway in human keratinocytes and suggest that targeting p 62 may help prevent <b>arsenic-induced</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancer...</b>|$|E

40|$|Chronic arsenic {{exposure}} {{is known to}} produce arsenicosis and cancer. To ascertain whether perturbation of methylation {{plays a role in}} such carcinogenesis, the degree of methylation of p 53 and p 16 gene in DNA obtained from blood samples of people chronically exposed to arsenic and skin cancer subjects was studied. Methylation-specific restriction endonuclease digestion followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of gene p 53 and bisulfite treatment followed by methylation-sensitive PCR of gene p 16 have been carried out to analyze the methylation status of the samples studied. Significant DNA hypermethylation of promoter region of p 53 gene was observed in DNA of arsenic-exposed people compared to control subjects. This hypermethylation showed a dose-response relationship. Further, hypermethylation of p 53 gene was also observed in <b>arsenic-induced</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> patients compared to subjects having skin cancer unrelated to arsenic, though not at significant level. However, a small subgroup of cases showed hypomethylation with high arsenic exposure. Significant hypermethylation of gene p 16 was also observed in cases of arsenicosis exposed to high level of arsenic. In man, arsenic has the ability to alter DNA methylation patterns in gene p 53 and p 16, which are important in carcinogenesis. Key Words: DNA; hypermethylation; hypomethylation; arsenic; cancer.

The occurrence of high arsenic (As) in groundwater and surface water mostly due to a combination of geological processes and/or anthropogenic activities. In Buyat areas which is located in Ratatotok regency covered about 200 km 2 and about 130, 000 people are living within that ranges. About 90 percent of them drink high-arsenic well water and consumed rice with Arsenic (As.). This sampling survey was conducted to investigate the arsenic level concentration in drinking water from well and rice grain and to characterize <b>arsenic-induced</b> <b>skin</b> lesion. Total water arsenic was measured by flow injection analysis using atomic fluorescence detection with inline photooxidation and continuous hydride generation. Rice arsenic was measured by different parts of rice plant and rice samples were oven-dried, digested with HNO 3, HCl and perchloric acid, filtered and tested with GFAAS. Then we assess the potential risks posed by community who are living in the area in term of target hazard quotient (THQ). We selected cases (persons with <b>arsenic-induced</b> <b>skin</b> lesions) and control (persons without <b>arsenic-induced</b> <b>skin</b> lesions) from the area concern and at the background sites area for control.

Results We observed that the odds of arsenic-related skin lesions were approximately three times higher among women who were anemic (hemoglobin[*]<[*] 120  g/L) compared to women with normal hemoglobin levels [Odds Ratio (OR) [*]=[*] 3. 32, 95  % Confidence Intervals (CI) : 1. 29, 8. 52] after adjusting for arsenic levels in drinking water and other covariates. Furthermore, 75  % of the women with anemia had adequate iron stores (serum ferritin ≥ 12  μg/L), suggesting that the majority of anemia detected in this population was unrelated to iron depletion. Conclusions Considering the magnitude of arsenic exposure and prevalence of anemia in Bangladeshi women, additional research is warranted that identifies the causes of anemia so that effective interventions can be implemented while arsenic remediation efforts continue...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Skin</b> <b>cancer</b> is {{the most}} common form of cancer in the United States and is a public health concern. There are over 5 million new cases of {{keratinocyte}} <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> (KC) (previously known as non-melanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer)</b> and over 65, 000 new cases of melanoma annually in the United States. <b>Skin</b> <b>cancer</b> is highly preventable, although prevention methods are not commonly practiced. Nurse practitioners have a key role in educating and encouraging patients to practice <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> prevention methods. Purpose/Aims: The purpose of this project was to determine whether a brief educational video can improve nurse practitioner knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> and <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> prevention counseling. Methods: A single subject pre-test post-test design guided this project. Participants completed an online pretest assessing <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Following the pretest participants were given access to the video intervention. The intervention included information about <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> and published guidelines about <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> prevention counseling. Changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors and satisfaction with the intervention were assessed through a post-test. Results: A total of 30 eligible Arizona nurse practitioners completed both the pretest and posttest surveys. There was a statistically significant increase (p=. 000) in knowledge from 64. 17 % on the pretest to 87. 5 % on the posttest. Attitudes about <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> and <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> counseling were fair on the pretest and significantly improved (p=. 000) on the posttest. On the pretest, nurse practitioners had poor attitudes regarding <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> prevention counseling practice behaviors. These attitudes favorably increased (p=. 009) on the posttest. Self-reported practice behaviors also improved significantly following the intervention (p=. 000). Participants' attitudes regarding the intervention were generally favorable. Conclusions: A brief educational intervention offered online to nurse practitioners is highly effective for improving their knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> and <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> prevention counseling. The intervention is feasible to administer and is acceptable to nurse practitioners...|$|R
40|$|Background: Reduction of {{immunosuppression}} {{is considered}} a reasonable adjuvant therapeutic strategy in solid-organ transplant recipients experiencing multiple or high-risk <b>skin</b> <b>cancers.</b> However, the literature provides no guidance about what threshold of cancer development would warrant initiation of reduction of immunosuppression. Objectives: To develop expert consensus guidelines for initiation of reduction of transplant-associated immunosuppression for solid-organ transplant recipients with severe <b>skin</b> <b>cancer.</b> Methods: An expert consensus panel was convened by the International Transplant <b>Skin</b> <b>Cancer</b> Collaborative and <b>Skin</b> Care for Organ Transplant Patients Europe Reduction of Immunosuppression Task Force. Thirteen hypothetical patient scenarios with graduated morbidity and mortality risks were presented and mean and mode expert opinions about appropriate level of reduction of systemic immunosuppression (mild, moderate, severe) were generated. Results: Mild reduction of transplant-associated immunosuppression was considered warranted once multiple <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> per year developed or with individual high-risk <b>skin</b> <b>cancers.</b> Moderate reduction was considered appropriate when patients experienced > 25 <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> per year or for <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> with a 10 % 3 -year risk of mortality. Severe reduction was considered warranted only for life-threatening <b>skin</b> <b>cancers.</b> Conclusions: Reduction of immunosuppression {{is considered a}} reasonable adjuvant management strategy for transplant recipients with numerous or life-threatening <b>skin</b> <b>cancers.</b> Proposed guidelines are presented for the graduated reduction of immunosuppression coincident with the increasing <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> risks...|$|R

40|$|Background: Nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} post-transplant malignancy found in renal transplant recipients. Long term immunosuppressant therapy, previous history of nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> and UV exposure are the greatest drivers of these malignancies in renal transplant recipients compared to the general population. Squamous cell carcinoma {{is the most}} prevalent type of nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> lesions {{that can lead to}} increased morbidity and metastasis in this population. Sirolimus is a relatively new immunosuppressant that is known to have anti-tumor effects, especially in the instance of <b>skin</b> <b>cancer.</b> Will sirolimus reduce the recurrence of nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> in renal transplant recipients with a previous history of nomelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer?</b> Method: An extensive medical literature search was completed using MEDLINE, CINAHL, EBSCO, and Web of Knowledge. Search terms used included <b>skin</b> <b>cancer,</b> <b>skin</b> neoplasm, organ transplant, renal transplant, and sirolimus. Relevant articles were further evaluated for quality using the GRADE criteria. Results: Three randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria of the systematic review. The studies showed a decreased incidence of nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> in renal transplant recipients with a history of nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer.</b> One study demonstrated a significantly longer survival free of squamous cell carcinoma in the sirolimus group compared to calcineurin inhibitor therapy. Another study found a significantly decreased rate of nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> in the sirolimus group. All studies observed an increased incidence of adverse drug reactions in the sirolimus group that led to high discontinuation rates. The overall quality of evidence was low after assessing each study with GRADE criteria. Conclusion: The findings suggest that sirolimus is effective at reducing the recurrence of nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> lesions in renal transplant recipients with a history of nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer.</b> While there appears to be some significance for sirolimus conversion of renal transplant recipients with nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer,</b> better quality research is necessary to determine the long term effects of sirolimus in renal transplant patients.
