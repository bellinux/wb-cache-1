500|$|Several {{actors were}} {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Robert Modell, even Lance Henriksen, who went on to play the lead role in Millennium. Initially, Gilligan considered Harvey Fierstein for the role of Modell, but Robert Wisden read the script and [...] "blew us away". Rob Bowman was pleased with Wisden's performance and said, [...] "I thought Robert Wisden was great as Pusher. He is a very energized kind of confident actor with lots of ideas of his own. It took me about {{a day and a half}} to get him into it, and then I never had to speak to him again, because he had that look in his eyes. I would walk up to talk to him about the scene <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he was already there.|$|E
2500|$|In On a Wing and a Prayer Campese wrote that, [...] "I {{was playing}} full-back and dropped a few bombs the All Blacks put up to me. I had a far from {{spectacular}} game {{and we ended}} up losing. Afterwards, I went in to have a shower <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Jonsey was very upset... But what right did our coach have to tell the other players, [...] "Don't worry, fellows, you played without a full-back today'. I found that out two days later and you can imagine how I felt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barresi: [...] "I {{called the}} editor at The Globe and I said, 'I have a tape, I'm {{on the way}} down town to hand it to the District Attorney.' And his words were, 'let us come with you.' And then I knew I had him. The next thought in my mind was I'm going to ask for $30,000. You always ask for twice as much as what you hope to get. He put me on hold, and within less than a minute he came back and he said 'well, we can't give you thirty, we'll give you ten.' I said 'make if fifteen,' he said 'you have a deal.'" [...] Reporter: [...] "Could you see the {{headlines}} coming? Barresi: [...] "Oh yeah, sure, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> money coming too." ...|$|E
60|$|But he {{grew tired}} of looking around, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he was {{beginning}} to get frightened.|$|R
60|$|Mr. John came {{up by the}} car, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he {{was in one of}} his moods.|$|R
60|$|The first peep of morning, then, {{showed us}} this horrible place, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Alan knit his brow.|$|R
2500|$|Carmichael joined ASCAP in 1931. The {{following}} year {{he began working}} as a songwriter for Ralph Peer's Southern Music Company, the first music firm to occupy the new Brill Building, which became famous as a New York songwriting mecca. The Great Depression rapidly {{put an end to}} the jazz scene of the Roaring Twenties. People were no longer attending clubs or buying music, forcing many musicians out of work. Carmichael was fortunate to retain his low-paying, but stable job as a songwriter with Southern Music. Beiderbecke's early death in 1931 also darkened Carmichael's mood. Of that time, he wrote later: [...] "I was tiring of jazz <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> other musicians were tiring as well. The boys were losing their enthusiasm for the hot stuff…. No more hot licks, no more thrills." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alderman {{was injured}} in the first test of the 1982-83 Ashes. He had taken 1-84 in the first innings {{when there was a}} pitch invasion. Alderman was hit {{in the back of the}} head by a member of the crowd, Gary Donnison. Alderman recalled, [...] "he ran off, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> there were no police in the {{vicinity}} so I attempted to apprehend him." [...] Alderman charged at Donnison and tackled him to the ground but fell on his shoulder and injured himself. [...] "I can't remember a lot of how I fell ... but I was immediately aware I was injured ... it was very painful indeed," [...] Alderman said. [...] "At the time I thought it would just pop back in - little did I know that it would be a year before I could bowl in a competitive match again," [...] he said. [...] "I had to learn to swim a mile a day for eight months. What is tough in sport, is that if you have a physical injury or problem, no one wants to know you. In a way, when I came back, it was like starting another career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Netanyahu defines {{capitalism}} as [...] "the {{ability to}} have individual initiative and competition to produce goods and services with profit, but not to shut out somebody else from {{trying to do the}} same." [...] He says that his views developed while he was working as an economic consult for Boston Consulting Group: [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the Boston Consulting Group looked at governments and worked for governments. They wanted to do a strategic plan for the government of Sweden. I was on that case and looked at other governments. So I went around to other governments in Europe in 1976 and I was looking at Britain. I was looking at France. I was looking at other countries, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they were stymied by concentrations of power that prevented competition. And I thought, hmm, as bad as they are, ours was worse because we had very little room for private sector competition to the extent that we had government-controlled or union-controlled companies, and so you really didn't get the competition or the growth... And I said, well, if I ever have a chance, I'll change that." ...|$|E
60|$|Again {{her eyes}} flamed upon inc. Her lips parted a little, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the white glimmer of her teeth.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> by {{the look}} of her now how sorely in need she was of my aid and comfort.|$|R
5000|$|I {{spent about}} two weeks, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wrote {{a song called}} [...] "Disco Down", that was just {{complete}} to a formula. [...] "Right, that'll do, there's your single." [...] And the record company creamed themselves when they heard it. It was like, [...] "I can't do this any more." [...] I was writing it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the video, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the front cover of the single, {{and it was just}} complete formula. There was no soul in it...|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} head away, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she was crying.|$|E
60|$|Grace turned pale, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{her sweet}} countenance became {{thoughtful}} and repentant.|$|E
60|$|Grace's cheeks flushed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she was {{extremely}} gratified, though still tremblingly anxious.|$|E
60|$|Silver paused, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> by {{the faces}} of George and his late comrades that these words had not been said in vain.|$|R
5000|$|... "If the ACC {{continues}} to struggle, and Florida State {{goes off to}} the SEC or something like that, and Clemson moves in a different direction, {{all of a sudden}} Virginia, Duke , and North Carolina — which are all very similar institutions to the Big Ten, there is a real possibility that we may end up having that kind of T which goes south. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> them joining us. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> them having a real interest in joining us." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{occurred}} to him that it was unnecessary to explain. He assisted me into a sitting position, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> with my own eyes.|$|R
60|$|At this, I {{began to}} feel uneasy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> my wife shared my trouble.|$|E
60|$|It {{was bright}} starlight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{we were making}} a {{complete}} circuit in the smooth water.|$|E
60|$|The figure glided yet nearer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it was trembling, and now {{its arms}} were {{extended}} also.|$|E
60|$|The man leaned {{upon his}} oar, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{in the gloom}} that his face was thrust forward, {{and that it was}} {{wrinkled}} with suspicion.|$|R
60|$|Cudworth {{held his}} hand {{to me in the}} moonlight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the scars. It {{looked as if it had}} been mangled by a dog.|$|R
60|$|My dearie stood {{straight}} up and the trembling left her. She stepped back, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her face, white as the dead, but calm and resolved.|$|R
60|$|Rupert's {{surprise}} was now more natural, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> his interest--shame on our propensities for it!--was very natural, too.|$|E
60|$|Then {{there was}} a short silence, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she was crying under her veil. I laid my hand upon hers.|$|E
60|$|The man's brow grew {{black with}} anger. He was very angry, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{it was with}} {{difficulty}} he kept his hands off me.|$|E
60|$|Father {{was silent}} for a few minutes. He was {{thinking}} deeply, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the lines of decision forming in his face. At last he spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall see}} that," [...] I cried, {{springing}} forward, {{but he was}} already gone, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> his tall form moving away through the gathering darkness.|$|R
60|$|They all sat {{and gazed}} into their glasses, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> they found my {{attitude}} on the affair unpalatable. But Miller was ready at all events.|$|R
60|$|I glanced {{towards the}} table. As I had expected, de Cartienne was {{watching}} us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he was straining every nerve to overhear our conversation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I don't know," [...] said Kendricks, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> his fancy was {{beginning}} {{to play with the}} situation; [...] "I don't see why it isn't a charming scheme." ...|$|E
60|$|One day {{he came to}} me as I {{was sitting}} in the club, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he had had an idea. He looked happier than he had done in weeks.|$|E
60|$|His moustaches {{bristled}} {{out more}} like a cat's than ever, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> by the flash of his eyes that he was carried away by his dream.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so. Of course, {{sometimes}} it was moonlight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> their faces well; and besides, {{the light of the}} lantern often fell upon their faces." ...|$|R
6000|$|The man, who {{had opened}} the door only a few inches, kept in the background, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing of him, but I heard his grim, monosyllable reply: ...|$|R
