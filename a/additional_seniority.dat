25|$|In 1965, Williams began {{pressing}} {{for a law}} that would require a mandatory retirement age of 65 for all elected officials. Though mandatory retirement was never enacted, Williams announced in 1969 that he would not seek a fifth term in the U.S. Senate. On December 31, 1970, he resigned from the Senate just before the end of his term, allowing his protégé, newly elected Republican William V. Roth, Jr., to gain <b>additional</b> <b>seniority</b> in his new class of U.S. Senators.|$|E
5000|$|Delaware: John J. Williams (R) {{retired and}} was {{replaced}} by William Roth (R). He subsequently (December 31, 1970) resigned to give Roth <b>additional</b> <b>seniority</b> in the next term.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, Gramm {{left his}} Senate seat (effective November 30) {{a few weeks}} before the {{expiration}} of his term in hopes that his successor, fellow Republican John Cornyn, could gain seniority over other newly elected senators.However, Cornyn did not gain <b>additional</b> <b>seniority</b> due to a 1980 Rules Committee policy.|$|E
50|$|Also in {{the state}} of Victoria, the head of police force is, unlike all the other states and territories, a 'Chief Commissioner'- as opposed to a 'Commissioner'. The reason for this is, during Victoria's pre-federation history, there was more than one {{commissioner}} in the colony, one metropolitan and one for the goldfields, hence an <b>additional</b> degree of <b>seniority</b> was introduced. The office of Chief Commissioner has remained since.|$|R
5000|$|The {{goal of the}} {{initiative}} {{was to create a}} new Oregon state statute mandating that only [...] "classroom performance" [...] — not <b>seniority,</b> <b>additional</b> duties, qualifications, advanced degrees, or additional training — would determine teachers' pay raises. It would also mandate that the [...] "most qualified" [...] teachers be retained under employment, replacing seniority as a major consideration. [...] "Classroom performance" [...] and [...] "most qualified" [...] are not defined by the measure.|$|R
2500|$|Over the years, {{recipients}} of the Iron Cross received ever increasing pensions, in 1842, those in need or not having any other pension or income would receive 100 francs, this amount was increased to 250 francs in 1855. [...] A law of 27 May 1857 gave civil servants who were {{recipients of}} the Iron Cross ten <b>additional</b> years of <b>seniority.</b> [...] A budgetary law enacted in 1858 gave pensions to widows and orphans of deceased {{recipients of the}} Iron Cross.|$|R
50|$|On October 6, 1948, Vera Bushfield was {{appointed}} to the Senate to temporarily fill the vacancy caused by her husband's death. She served from October 6, 1948 until her resignation on December 26, 1948. Mundt had won the November election, and her resignation enabled Governor George T. Mickelson to appoint Mundt to the vacancy, giving him a few days of <b>additional</b> <b>seniority</b> over other Senators elected in 1948, whose terms began in January, 1949.|$|E

5000|$|Geoffrey {{entered the}} Royal Navy in 1889 {{at the age}} of fourteen. He was {{appointed}} a midshipman on 14 June 1892. His naval career got {{off to a good start}} as he was advanced seven months in seniority for results that allowed him to pass out of Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. [...] However, he lost a month of this <b>additional</b> <b>seniority</b> for leaving his ship despite having his leave stopped in 1894. [...] He was promoted to acting sub-lieutenant on 19 February 1896, and he was confirmed in the rank of sub-lieutenant on 20 January 1897, back-dated to the original acting promotion. [...] He was promoted to lieutenant on 30 September 1898.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{training}} phase for recruits to the National Police Force was nine months, {{followed by a}} year of practical training. Promotions to corporal, sergeant, and sergeant major were based on <b>seniority,</b> <b>additional</b> training, and performance. In the Franco era, most police officers were seconded from the army. Under a 1978 law, future police officers were to receive separate training, and army officers detailed to the police were to be permanently transferred. By 1986 only 170 army officers remained in the National Police Force. Under the 1986 organic law, military-type training for police was to be terminated, and all candidate officers were to attend the Higher Police School at Ávila, which previously had served as the three-year training center for the Higher Police Force. The ranks of the plainclothes corps—commissioners, subcommissioners, and inspectors of first, second, and third class—were to be assimilated into the ranking system of the uniformed police—colonel, lieutenant colonel, major, captain, and lieutenant. Two lower categories—subinspection and basic—would include all nonofficer uniformed personnel. The newly unified National Police Corps was {{to be responsible for}} issuing identity cards and passports, as well as for immigration and deportation controls, refugees, extradition, deportation, gambling controls, drugs, and supervision of private security forces.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Economic Sciences, Washington State UniversityAcademic couples {{make up a}} {{significant}} portion of the academic labor market. Unlike other dual-career households, academic couples must not only find employment in the same region, but often in the same institution. Previous work has not considered how outcomes may be different when dual career households work for the same employer. In the first chapter, we develop a theoretical model of the academic labor market in which couples wish to remain together but may be heterogeneous in their level of productivity. We consider two evaluation polices for hiring academic couples, an independent and an average policy. The predictions of the model are sensitive to the choice of evaluation policy. We test for differences in productivity using annual publications as a proxy for productivity. We find that couples have more publications per year than their peers. In the second chapter I set up a test of the theory that high mobility costs for academics result in negative returns to seniority. Academic couples are more limited in their job prospects such that their expected market wage, if they were to move, is lower than their colleagues' which results in a higher probability of remaining at the current institution. A greater probability of remaining means the university can offer a lower wage to couples each year than they could for other faculty and maintain the same probability that the couple will accept. I first estimate the relative probability of leaving the university and find that couples are much less likely to leave than their colleagues. I then estimate a wage equation similar to previous literature and find evidence that academic couples are penalized more for each <b>additional</b> year of <b>seniority</b> relative to other academics but the result is not robust across multiple specifications. In the third chapter I compare outcomes of couples hired into the same department with couples hired into different departments. I suspect outcomes may be different when multiple department heads are involved in hiring and salary decisions rather than a single department head. I find differences in annual publications, salary and employment duration. I then discuss policy implications. School of Economic Sciences, Washington State Universit...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{coordination}} problem of agents deciding to join a group that uses membership revenues to provide a discrete public good and excludable ben-efits. The public good and the benefits are jointly produced, so that benefits are valued only if the group succeeds in providing the public good. With asymmetric information {{about the cost of}} provision, the membership game admits a unique equilibrium and we characterize the optimal membership fee. In a static context, we show that heterogeneity in agents ’ valuations for the excludable benefits is al-ways detrimental to the group. We also consider a dynamic version of the model where heterogeneity arises endogenously: returning members receive <b>additional</b> <b>seniority</b> benefits at the expense of new members. The dynamic game has a unique equilibrium in the space of monotone strategies, and we characterize the ex-ante optimal dynamic contract. In this context, we show that offering se-niority benefits is beneficial for the group despite the heterogeneity in valuations created, and we prove that the optimal level of seniority benefits increases when asymmetries in information among agents become small...|$|E
