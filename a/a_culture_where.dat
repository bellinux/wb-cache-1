Inevitably, many of the mask types relate to use in these ceremonies and are linked with the activities of secret societies.

This is often accomplished by linking the mask to an ancestral presence, and thus bringing the past into the present.|$|E

25|$|In The Culture of Narcissism, Christopher Lasch {{defines a}} narcissistic culture as one where every {{activity}} and relationship {{is defined by}} the hedonistic need to acquire the symbols of wealth, this becoming the only expression of rigid, yet covert, social hierarchies. It is <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>where</b> liberalism only exists insofar as it serves a consumer society, and even art, sex and religion lose their liberating power. In such a society of constant competition, there can be no allies, and little transparency. The threats to acquisitions of social symbols are so numerous, varied and frequently incomprehensible, that defensiveness, as well as competitiveness, becomes a way of life. Any real sense of community is undermined—or even destroyed—to be replaced by virtual equivalents that strive, unsuccessfully, to synthesize a sense of community.|$|E

500|$|While {{aboard the}} ship Greyhound, Newton gained notoriety for {{being one of}} the most profane men the captain had ever met. In <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>where</b> sailors {{commonly}} used oaths and swore, Newton was admonished several times for not only using the worst words the captain had ever heard, but creating new ones to exceed the limits of verbal debauchery. In March 1748, while the Greyhound was in the North Atlantic, a violent storm came upon the ship that was so rough it swept overboard a crew member who was standing where Newton had been moments before. After hours of the crew emptying water from the ship and expecting to be capsized, Newton and another mate tied themselves to the ship's pump to keep from being washed overboard, working for several hours. After proposing the measure to the captain, Newton had turned and said, [...] "If this will not do, then Lord have mercy upon us!" [...] Newton rested briefly before returning to the deck to steer for the next eleven hours. During his time at the wheel he pondered his divine challenge.|$|E
500|$|In a 1998 {{interview}} in Christianity Today, Bong Rin Ro of the Asia Graduate School of Theology {{suggested that the}} growth in popularity of prosperity theology in South Korea reflects a strong [...] "shamanistic influence". Bong pointed to parallels between the tradition of paying shamans for healing and the prosperity theology's contractual doctrine about giving and blessings. Asia's economic problems, he argued, encouraged {{the growth of the}} doctrine in South Korea, though he claims it ignores the poor and needy. During the interview, he stated that he saw the problem beginning to be reversed, citing calls for renewed faith and other practices. Cho Yong-gi, pastor of Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul, has been criticized for shamanising Christianity. This criticism has focused on his healing and exorcism ministries and his promise of material blessings. Malaysian Christian writer Hwa Yung has defended Cho's healing and exorcism ministries, arguing that he successfully contextualized the Gospel in <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>where</b> shamanism was still prevalent. However, Hwa criticizes Cho's teaching of earthly blessings for not reflecting a trust in God's daily provision and for their heavy focus on earthly wealth.|$|E

But even if you ultimately reject their messages, old-school fairy tales are part of our cultural vocabulary. There's something a little sad about kids growing up in <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>where</b> their fairy tales come pre-satirized, the skepticism, critique and revision having been done for them by the mama birds of Hollywood." [...] Cory Edwards wrote into the magazine, expressing his similar sentiments and writing, [...] "As the writer-director of Hoodwinked, it may surprise you that I couldn't agree more with James Poniewozik's article. Even as I was making the film, I asked myself the same question: Are we parodying something that kids should have the chance to experience first, 'un-parodied?' We {{went to great lengths to}} distance our film from Shreks humor (and no, I don't think Shrek considers kids). I would hope that Hoodwinked and its sequels will be seen as trying to do something genuine with its characters, rather than look for the next joke at the expense of innocence.

500|$|Louise Watson, {{writing for}} Screenonline, felt the film's costume and make-up help [...] "convey the full Cinderella {{transformation}} of Austen's heroine. At first the undervalued family martyr, Anne is the wallflower {{who has lost}} her 'bloom'. Her loose-fitting costumes hint at how she has pined away since refusing Wentworth... As she regains her confidence, she blossoms; she dresses becomingly, her eyes sparkle and her features become animated". Paulette Richards argues that the film's [...] "unreliable" [...] male characters, such as Sir Walter, are identified as such by the flamboyant nature of their clothing. This flamboyance is especially clear to modern viewers, who live in <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>where</b> [...] "real men" [...] are expected to care little for their clothing. Conversely, the film's Wentworth is typically depicted in naval uniforms, which is a contrast to Bryan Marshall's version of the character in the 1971 adaptation. This uniform helps set Wentworth apart {{from many of the}} other male characters, allowing him to appear romantic but isolated. Gina and Andrew MacDonald had a similar view of the film, writing that it accurately captures Austen's satire by juxtaposing the upper classes' extravagance in fashion with the virtuous qualities of the Royal Navy. The naval men's profession is emphasised by the frequency of wearing their uniforms, in contrast to other adaptations of the novel.|$|E
2500|$|Netball {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular women's {{participation}} sports in South Africa. The sport is also played by a large number of men.

The history of South Africa's netball involvement mirrors that of other sports played in the country like rugby union.

2500|$|Christian egalitarians {{respond by}} arguing that God is not gendered, and that males and females image God equally and without any differences. In addition, terms such as [...] "Father" [...] and [...] "Son", used in {{reference}} to God, should be understood as analogies or metaphors used by the biblical authors to communicate attributes about God in <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>where</b> men had social privilege. Similarly, Christ became a male not because it was theologically necessary, but because 1st-century Jewish culture would not have accepted a female Messiah. Wayne Grudem takes exception to these egalitarian arguments, insisting that Christ's maleness was theologically necessary; he also alleges that egalitarians are increasingly advocating that God should {{be thought of as}} [...] "Mother" [...] as well as [...] "Father", a move which he sees as theologically liberal.|$|E
