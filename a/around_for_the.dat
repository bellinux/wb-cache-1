5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
5|$|Manager Johnny Duncan {{identified}} Revie as {{the player}} {{to build his}} team <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1947–48 and 1948–49 seasons, and though the Foxes fared poorly in the league they managed to reach the 1949 FA Cup Final. Revie scored the opening goal of the semi-final victory over First Division champions Portsmouth, having being told pre-match that opposition goalkeeper Ernest Butler tended to palm the ball over the attacker's head before reclaiming possession Revie positioned himself {{to take advantage of}} the situation when teammate Jack Lee challenged Butler for the ball, leaving Revie with a simple conversion. However Revie suffered a nasal haemorrhage caused by a burst vein one week before the final, and the condition became so severe it would threaten his life and see him miss his first chance to play at Wembley. He could only listen on the radio as Leicester lost 3–1 to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the final. Revie decided to leave Leicester after Duncan left the club, having already been dissatisfied with the club's lack of progress in the league.|$|E
25|$|There {{are those}} in golf who would argue into next month that the final two rounds of the 1977 British Open were the {{greatest}} head-to-head golf match ever played. Not having been <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first five hundred or so years of the game, I'm not qualified to speak on such matters.

25|$|The 60th Street Tunnel {{opened on}} August 1, 1920, {{allowing}} BMT trains to reach Queensboro Plaza. However, the stations on the Astoria and Corona Lines were built to IRT specifications, which were too narrow for BMT rolling stock. As a result, those trains terminated at Queensboro Plaza using a relay track {{east of the}} station to turn <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> return trip to Manhattan.|$|E
25|$|The {{station was}} built in 1912 and {{remained}} in operation until 1938 when financial distress caused the New York, Westchester & Boston Railway to shut down. The property lay dormant for many years until it was purchased by a local artist in the mid-1950s for conversion to a private residence. The building still retains most of the original details including the two original passenger platforms. The original driveway and turn <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> station has been converted to a dead-end street.|$|E

The biggest risk to the public is on Job Glacier, where large fumaroles were discovered. While there was some indication that the fumarole field has been <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> last 40 years, that July a helicopter pilot who was trained as a geologist noticed the fumaroles on the glacier. On top of that, throughout the summer of 2016 the NRC received reports of a sulphuric smell around the valley of Mount Meager.|$|E

25|$|In {{the season}} opener on Monday Night Football against the Arizona Cardinals, Smith led the 49ers to a 20–17 win in a two-minute comeback. While down 17–13 with less than two-minutes left, Smith drove down the field, {{highlighted}} by a 25-yard scramble. After the scramble, he threw a 22-yard pass to Arnaz Battle that was fumbled on the one-yard line, but recovered by a 49er so the ball was placed back on the one-yard line with 26 seconds left. The following play Battle ran an end <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game-winning touchdown. Smith finished the game 15 for 31 with 126yards and two rushes for 37yards.|$|E
25|$|The year of 1971 {{was vital}} to VAM as it {{represented}} a complete turn <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> company. The new Camioneta Rambler American {{based on the}} Hornet Sportabout was introduced, the Rambler Classic obtained all characteristics of AMC's new Matador, and the Javelin was restyled as a new generation. On the outside, the car was {{exactly the same as}} its AMC counterpart with the only exception of the wheels and the lack of factory stripes and decals. A unique characteristic of the second generation VAM Javelin was round porthole opera windows mounted on the C-pillars installed by some VAM dealerships either with or without vinyl roofs.|$|E
25|$|As mayor, Voinovich was {{a member}} of the National League of Cities and was elected President in 1985. Voinovich also oversaw a huge scale urban renaissance {{downtown}}. Sohio (purchased by BP America in 1987), Ohio Bell, and Eaton Corporation all built new offices downtown (most notably the BP Building). Brothers Richard and David Jacobs astonished the city by rescuing its troubled Indians franchise, ultimately turning it <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> better. The two also improved the desolate area located by the Erieview Tower and turned it into the glass-roofed Galleria at Erieview. Voinovich also enticed Society Bank to build the Society Center, the largest skyscraper in Cleveland and the 15th largest in the nation (since renamed Key Tower). In addition, the National Civic League awarded Cleveland the All-America City Award three times in five years (1982, 1984, 1986), in addition to its first, won in 1950.|$|E

25|$|Late in 2008 Jennings {{took over}} as head coach of Royal Challengers Bangalore, a team in the Indian Premier League owned by the {{business}} tycoon Vijay Mallya. He was now heading a unit that experienced a forgettable IPL 2008 after finishing 7th on the log among the 8 competing teams. Jennings brought the team together by making Anil Kumble {{the captain of the}} side for the second edition of the IPL that was to start in South Africa. Under Jennings, Royal Challengers Bangalore had success and made it to the finals of the league facing Deccan Chargers in 2009. This was a big turn <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> franchise and the team who had a bad run the previous season. The same year, Royal Challengers Bangalore also qualified for the inaugural Champions League Twenty20. In 2010, the team made it to the semi-finals losing to Mumbai Indians and later finishing 3rd on the table.|$|E
25|$|He managed {{only one}} World Cup {{appearance}} though, after England failed {{to qualify for}} both the 1974 and 1978 tournaments. He finally reached a World Cup in 1982 when England got to the finals in Spain. He was duly named in the squad for the tournament but was suffering from a chronic back injury and was unfit {{to play in a}}ll of England's group games. In a last, desperate effort to play in a World Cup (he knew {{that he would not be}} <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1986 competition) he secretly hired a car and drove from Spain to a specialist he knew in Germany for intensive treatment. He recovered sufficiently to appear as a substitute for the last 26 minutes of England's final Second Round game against hosts Spain. Unfortunately, though, his brief experience of World Cup football saw him miss a point-blank header which would have broken the deadlock, in a game England needed to win to progress to the semi-finals. England drew the game 0-0 and were eliminated from the competition.|$|E
25|$|Luke is {{revealed}} to be keeping secret that the drug therapy is only a temporary solution, and Laura will eventually return to her catatonic state. Lulu is able to convince her cousin Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright) to postpone her marriage to Jasper Jacks (Ingo Rademacher), allowing her parents to use the supplies already in place. On November 16, 2006, Luke and Laura remarry on their 25th wedding anniversary. A drunken Tracy has {{to be removed from}} the ceremony, and scheming Maxie manages to sneak into the ceremony and catch Laura's bouquet, much like Scott had 25 years before. On November 20, Luke reveals that Laura's illness is no longer mental but physical and she will soon revert to her catatonic state. Laura decides she wants an early Christmas as she may not be <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> real one, and is able to comfort Lulu when she reveals the truth about her abortion. When Luke arrives with the tree, Laura is confused, confirming that her catatonia is returning. After being escorted back to the asylum, Laura reveals to her daughter that she doesn't think she really killed Rick Webber and asks her to prove her innocence. After saying goodbye to her family, Laura returns to her chair and sits with Luke as he tearfully watches her slip back into silence.|$|E

Ellen McLain provided {{the voice of the}} antagonist GLaDOS. Erik Wolpaw noted, [...] "When we were still fishing <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> turret voice, Ellen did a sultry version. It didn't work for the turrets, but we liked it a lot, and so a slightly modified version of that became the model for GLaDOS's final incarnation."

500|$|SFX {{magazine}} {{ranked the}} episode as the sixth [...] "Top 10 Resurrections", reasoning that it allowed Mulder to be <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> series finale a year later.

In a list comparing Fringe episodes {{with those of the}} X-Files, UGO Networks writer Alex Zalben named [...] "Deadalive" [...] as the best resurrection story, beating out Fringes [...] "Unearthed". Zalben cited the [...] "emotional reunion at the end" [...] as the deciding factor, though [...] "both [...] kind of suck".|$|E

Initially fearing that he had made some mistake and that they were going to kill his character off, Johnson learned that Whitney would be enlisting into the Marines. The actor has expressed his pleasure in the way the writers handled Whitney's departure, by giving the character the exit of a hero.|$|E

[...] In a similar list, Complex enlisted the 20 best characters from the series, ranking her the 17th best character. Comparison was also made to the other female characters in the game such as Ivy, calling it a [...] "stark contrast". Additional praise was given in their review of Soulcalibur IV, stating an approval of her design combined with her personality, and a preference for her over the game's unlockable characters.|$|E
