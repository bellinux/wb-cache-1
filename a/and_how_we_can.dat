The area is home to huge colonies of gannets, puffins, skuas and other seabirds. The centre allows visitors to watch live video from the islands as well as learn about the threats the birds face <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> protect them, and has helped to significantly raise the profile of seabird conservation in the UK. Seabird tourism can provide income for coastal communities as well as raise the profile of seabird conservation. For example, the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in New Zealand attracts 40,000 visitors a year.|$|E

25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

[...] In response, LDS Church officials issued a statement saying the church is [...] "politically neutral" [...] and hoping that [...] "the campaign practices of political candidates would not suggest that their candidacy is supported by or connected to the church." [...] Rammell later retracted his original plan to limit his meetings only to LDS men, apologizing to [...] "all those citizens who are not members of the LDS faith, who have expressed a sincere interest in attending my meetings and discussing this prophecy <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> step forward and save the United States Constitution".|$|E
500|$|Initial {{hardware}} for the 360's successor, {{commonly referred}} to by the industry as the [...] "Xbox 720", was reportedly under development as early as May 2011. The official developer kit was codenamed Durango, {{and appeared to be}} available to developers by mid-2012. Leaked documents suggested that the new console would include an improved Kinect sensor, cloud access to games and media, integration with phone and tablet devices, and technology to provide players heads-up displays on glasses worn by the player, codenamed [...] "Fortaleza"; Microsoft did not comment on these reported features. Leaked design documents also suggested that Microsoft was seeking to eliminate the ability to play used games, though Microsoft later clarified it was still reviewing the design and were [...] "thinking about what is next <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> push the boundaries of technology like we did with Kinect", but did not comment on the validity of the information.|$|E
500|$|Like {{many other}} African hip hop groups {{including}} Positive Black Soul, Daara J takes an activist stance. Faada Freddy states: [...] "We tell of peace <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> live together {{because there are}} lots of conflicts going on nowadays. We're here on behalf of the Africans to remind everybody that it shouldn't be like that. There's always a solution. Rather than fussing and fighting we'd better learn to live in peace and live together, because that's the only way to survive." [...] The group is especially focused on educating the world about Africa. Faada Freddy has also stressed the importance of understanding life on the continent: [...] "Nowadays people are tending to show the negative part of Africa but Africa is not only about AIDS, heartache, corruption and all that even though it exists just like everywhere else. But Africa has a lot to provide." [...] In the Senegalese election of 2000, Daara J were involved in editing speeches for political leaders and the promotion of that year's campaign against corruption.|$|E

500|$|The trio {{embarked}} on a European tour the following fall, during which DeLonge felt increasingly conflicted both about his creative freedom within the group and the toll touring was taking on his family life. [...] "It became [...] we weren't a band, it wasn't {{the three of us}} working together for a goal," [...] said Hoppus, [...] "it was like me and Travis having to pull his along, and be like, 'Come on, let's go, let's do this that we all created and that we love.'" [...] DeLonge eventually expressed his desire to take a half-year respite from touring in order {{to spend more time with}} family. Hoppus and Barker were dismayed by his decision, which they felt was an overly long break. In addition, DeLonge was not fond of Barker's new reality television series, Meet the Barkers; he disliked television cameras everywhere, feeling as though his personal privacy was invaded. Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, DeLonge agreed to perform at Music for Relief's Concert for South Asia, a benefit show to aid victims. Further arguments ensued during rehearsals, rooted in the band member's increasing paranoia and bitterness toward one another. DeLonge asserted he would only record another album at his home in San Diego, suggesting he mail Pro Tools files back and forth to Hoppus and Barker in Los Angeles. The duo were flexible regarding DeLonge's time off, but became angry when he began deciding [...] "when we can and can't tour, when <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> record." ...|$|E

While previous encyclopedias, notably the Encyclopædia Britannica, were book-based, Microsoft's Encarta, published in 1993, was available on CD-ROM and hyperlinked. The development of the World Wide Web led to many attempts to develop internet encyclopedia projects. An early proposal for a web-based encyclopedia was Interpedia in 1993 by Rick Gates; this project died before generating any encyclopedic content.
