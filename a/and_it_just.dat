5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
25|$|On August 25, 2009, Griffin {{released}} a second comedy album, Suckin' It for the Holidays, in another {{bid for a}} Grammy. The album was initially {{released a}}s a digital download and retail released on November 3, 2009. Despite the album's holiday title, it contains little holiday-related content, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> barely made the nominations cut-off. On December 2, 2009 it was nominated for Best Comedy Album, making it Griffin's second Grammy nomination.|$|E
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> kind of set in.|$|E

500|$|... "Redux II" [...] {{was highly}} praised by Carter, saying that [...] "I think that Redux II {{is one of}} the best episodes we've ever done". Frank Spotnitz said [...] "Redux II is one of my {{favorite}} episodes. I think the story has a crystal purity and clarity, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> comes to a perfect point for me". Anderson said [...] "I thought it was a terrific episode, especially the scenes in the hearing room, and the whole progression of Scully praying. How it was written and shot and how it was edited. Fabulous".|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} remix features Teyana Taylor and rapper Fabolous, and {{was released}} by Songz via Twitter during his [...] "Music Monday" [...] series preceding the album. The second features Mase who jumped on dual remixes for the song and Drake's [...] "Best I Ever Had." [...] In an interview with New York's Power 105.1, {{he said that the}} death of Michael Jackson inspired his latest comeback, stating, [...] "Mike passed away <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> lit the fire in me—it made me go in the studio and do something. I’m excited." ...|$|E
500|$|Oates {{was one of}} the NHL's great playmakers, a {{style that}} he credits his father as encouraging: [...] "It was just kind of our family talks: 'If you can be unselfish, your {{teammates}} will always like you.' <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> kind of became my role, where I was obviously trying to please my dad, growing up and becoming a playmaker out of that." [...] Oates' father, a British immigrant, idolized Stanley Matthews, considered one of the greatest soccer players of all time and hoped that his son would adopt a pass-first mentality similar to Matthews.|$|E
5|$|It {{had nothing}} to do with his {{immigration}} status. <b>And</b> <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> being used by advocates of this crushing anti-immigration policy to make a cheap political point.|$|R

5000|$|DailyGrindhouse.com {{called the}} film [...] "a gleefully bloody {{tale of a}} roller derby team against the supernatural, <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> as {{energetic}} <b>and</b> fun as the sport itself." ...|$|R
500|$|Though {{the season}} was much more violent than {{previous}} MCU works, DeKnight felt that sexual violence would be [...] "too far", saying that [...] "Daredevil wasn’t asking {{for a lot of}} sexual situations, especially since Matt Murdock is not really in the position to get into a relationship, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> didn’t fit the story for that season. I think that’ll change moving forward, but I never pushed any kind of sexual agenda on the show. I think once Daredevil was a hit and people were really responding positively, you can see the progression into more of an adult world in Jessica Jones." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It's confusing. I felt {{a little}} let down with my {{releases}} from Aphrodite. I was caught out {{like a lot of}} artists were, with record companies figuring out how to do single releases these days. I remember doing a promo for one of the last singles <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> felt really old-fashioned. I'm pretty computer-savvy, something didn't feel right, but no one said anything to me. You get Britney releasing [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] and Gaga's [...] "Born This Way" [...] available on iTunes the day you hear it first. That's how it should be. And there's me waiting for a mid-week chart figure like it's 1989." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{heard about}} [...] <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> really touched me, {{and she had}} stuff in her life that she could relate to. Gaga {{is one of the}} most talented artists I have worked with in my life and I'm excited about doing more with her... There are a lot of levels to the song. There's {{something}} very vulnerable about it and something very defiant about it, especially the way [...] sings it. The first verse is vulnerable—'You tell me it's going to get better?'—and the second verse comes in and it builds. Really? It gets better? No. You don't know until it happens to you...|$|E
6000|$|... "Better put about," [...] {{he said to}} the mate, [...] "and cruise about until daylight. We ain’t {{found the}} belt either, <b>and</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>just</b> {{possible}} he’s got it." ...|$|R

500|$|In a 2003 {{interview}} with the Grand Rapids Press, Dufek recalled growing up in Ann Arbor and meeting his father's Michigan teammates. [...] "Living in Ann Arbor, and seeing {{all the things that}} embody a great university, you learned that there were highly successful people in athletics, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> made you want to feel a part of it. Then, as you got older, and you got more deeply involved in the game yourself, you just hoped that {{you had a chance to}} play in college -- and after watching all those games at Michigan Stadium, that maybe Michigan would take a chance on you." ...|$|E
500|$|Show creator Daniel Knauf {{stated that}} the tree in Carnivàle is the iconic Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden. Its implied meaning and power {{prompted}} him to {{place it on the}} Tattooed Man's chest because [...] "this is where you will build your empire. This is what it all boils down, [...] <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> had a certain power." [...] Played by Don Swayze, the Tattooed Man is often depicted without a focus on his face, although a few frames in the pilot episode show him played by Clancy Brown (Brother Justin). Knauf confirmed the Tattooed Man as the spiritual representation of the Usher of Destruction.|$|E
500|$|Before Selena signed her {{contract}} with EMI Latin in 1989, Behar and Stephen Finfer requested Selena for an English-language debut album. She {{was asked to}} make three demonstration recordings for Charles Koppelman, chairman of EMI Records. After reviewing them, Koppelman declined a crossover attempt, believing Selena should first strengthen her fan base. In a 2007 interview, Behar spoke about the difficulty of recording Selena's English-language debut. He said EMI [...] "had let {{all of us to}} believe that she would record in English, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> wasn't materializing for whatever reason". Behar said the record company [...] "didn't believe, they didn't think it could happen", and continuously told Selena and her father [...] "it wasn't the right time" [...] for an English-language debut.|$|E
6000|$|It was a gaiety, {{for that}} matter, that Mitchy's could match. [...] "It does promise well! But I've another idea even now, <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> what I'm again trying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, father. It is good discipline. White Fang {{will have}} to learn many things, <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> as well that he begins now. He'll adjust himself all right." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I'm deeply {{concerned}} about where we are," [...] Mr Beattie said. [...] "If they have stuffed this up, they should come clean. There are now too many questions <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> looking sloppy.|$|R
500|$|The {{original}} pilot from 2009 was poorly {{received in}} a private viewing with friends, one of whom, Craig Mazin, said to Benioff and Weiss, [...] "You guys have a massive problem", and said [...] "change everything" [...] when asked for ideas. It was so disliked that Kit Harington joked that when he annoys Benioff and Weiss, they threaten to release the episode on YouTube. Weiss said of the viewing: [...] "Watching them watch the pilot was a deeply humiliating, painful experience, because these are very smart individuals, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> clearly wasn’t working for any of them on a very basic level." [...] For example, it was never established that the two major characters, Jaime and Cersei Lannister were in fact brother and sister, a major plot point.|$|E
500|$|... 'You know what, I'm {{going to}} be freezing. I'm {{going to be}} miserable, I'll be {{complaining}} all day, I'll be sorry that I ever chose a cold place. So I said, 'Let's {{do it in the}} desert, it'll be warm,' and it would be sort of the opposite, because even though you think of deserts as being hot, they're still sort of frozen in terms of there's no vegetation and they're very desolate. I thought that that would still work as a visual, but then we got there and it was like 20 degrees below zero, it was bitterly cold, and I was barefoot. I was barefoot for the entire video, and then it started pouring rain and everyone got really sick, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> actually {{turned out to be a}} really miserable experience.|$|E
500|$|That {{sense of}} {{crossing}} cultural boundaries was, for Al Kooper, {{at the heart}} of Blonde on Blonde: [...] " [...] was the quintessential New York hipster—what was he doing in Nashville? It didn't make any sense whatsoever. But you take those two elements, pour them into a test tube, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> exploded." [...] For Mike Marqusee, Dylan had succeeded in combining traditional blues material with modernist literary techniques: [...] " [...] took inherited idioms and boosted them into a modernist stratosphere. 'Pledging My Time' and 'Obviously 5 Believers' adhered to blues patterns that were venerable when Dylan first encountered them in the mid-fifties (both begin with the ritual Delta invocation of [...] "early in the mornin"). Yet like 'Visions of Johanna' or 'Memphis Blues Again', these songs are beyond category. They are allusive, repetitive, jaggedly abstract compositions that defy reduction." ...|$|E
50|$|Lu Jie {{has no idea}} {{her husband}} Yongzhao is leading a double life, until the day she sees him {{entering}} a hotel with a young woman. Her world crumbles - <b>and</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>just</b> the beginning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, don't {{ask me why}} {{she refused}} him, Owen. Of course she couldn't care for a boy like that. But he can't realize <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> as miserable for {{him as if he}} were a {{thousand}} years old." ...|$|R
30|$|To {{the general}} public this {{phenomenon}} is not too much of problem <b>and</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>just</b> a small psychological experiment at best, but it’s a different story in science laboratories. Such a tendency could cause a serious problem in science field.|$|R
500|$|Ki {{was mixed}} by Townsend, and {{features}} very little compression, {{in contrast with}} his usual wall-of-sound production style. Townsend explained that he originally [...] "tried doing the wall-of-sound with it <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> kind of ruined it...it {{turned it into a}} not-so-good Strapping record." [...] The album deliberately eschews the loudness wars, the recent music industry practice of competitively mastering audio to seem as loud as possible. [...] "I officially pull my hat out of the loudness wars", Townsend told his mastering engineer. The album's songs were primarily written in open C tuning, except for [...] "A Monday", [...] "Trainfire", and [...] "Disruptr" [...] in open B, [...] "Heaven's End" [...] and [...] "Winter" [...] in open B, and [...] "Quiet Riot" [...] in standard tuning. Townsend has cited Second Nature by The Young Gods, Paul Horn, Chants of India by Ravi Shankar, and Ween as influences on the album.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Eric Kripke had {{previously}} {{written for the}} WB series Tarzan, and was offered the chance to pitch show ideas to the network. He used the opportunity for Supernatural, a concept he had been developing for nearly ten years. Kripke envisioned Supernatural as a road trip series, deeming it the [...] "best vehicle to tell these stories because it's pure, stripped down and uniquely American... These stories exist in these small towns all across the country, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> makes so much sense to drive {{in and out of}} these stories." [...] Though the network rejected his initial pitch—a tabloid reporter investigates supernatural occurrences throughout the country—they were still interested in a series featuring urban legends. Kripke quickly suggested a Route 66-style series, and the network loved it. Filming was greenlit after director David Nutter, who previously had worked with Kripke on Tarzan, signed on.|$|E
500|$|Asked in February 2017 {{if there}} would be more Audioslave reunion shows in the future, Cornell replied, [...] "It's always a possibility. I mean, we've been talking about it for at least three or four years now. We were talking about {{actually}} picking dates, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> ended up not working out because everybody's so busy. They have another band again, they all have separate bands that they do themselves, I have Soundgarden and a solo career that's taking up a lot of time, and I just did Temple of the Dog. So, it's really honestly as simple as we end up having a window of time where it's comfortable for everybody and we want to do it, because I definitely feel like everybody's up for it." [...] On May 18, 2017, Cornell was found dead in his hotel room in Detroit after performing at a show with Soundgarden, ending the possibility of a reunion.|$|E
6000|$|... "I declare, my dear," [...] she said, [...] "it's {{the most}} {{delightful}} thing I've heard for years <b>and</b> years; <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> exactly what I had planned myself, only I never told anybody. Dear me; {{it makes me}} so happy!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Jason Heller of The A.V. Club {{noted that}} their second album [...] "crams {{splinters}} of rhythm into dark, gorgeous choruses and acidic shout-alongs. The venom is still there, <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> as potent, but it tastes a little sweeter this time around" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can see {{well enough}} alone, <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> as well you shouldn't know HOW I kem or HOW I went away. Enough {{for you to}} know that I'll be miles away before that paper comes out. So stay where you are." ...|$|R
