5|$|Whereas <b>Asynchronous</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Mode</b> (ATM) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) {{are typical}} data-link {{protocols}} for larger networks such as WANs; Ethernet and Token Ring are typical data-link protocols for LANs. These protocols {{differ from the}} former protocols {{in that they are}} simpler, e.g., they omit features such as quality of service guarantees, and offer collision prevention. Both of these differences allow for more economical systems.|$|E
5|$|For the Internet, the {{physical}} medium and {{data link protocol}} can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads {{to the adoption of}} media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the <b>Asynchronous</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Mode</b> (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.|$|E
5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as <b>Asynchronous</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Mode</b> (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E
40|$|The AXD 301 is a new, multiservice, carrier-class ATM {{switch from}} Ericsson {{that can be}} used in several {{positions}} in a network. In its initial release, the AXD 301 is scalable from 10 Gbitrs [...] in one subrack [...] up to 160 Gbitrs. The AXD 301 supports every service category defined for ATM, as well as integrated support for IPand voice. An advanced buffering mechanism allows services to be mixed without compromising quality. Designed for non-stop operation, the AXD 301 incorporates duplicate hardware and software modularity, which enables individual modules to be upgraded without disturbing traffic. The switching system, which supports both ATM Forum and ITU-T signaling, is easily managed using an embedded Web-based management system. q 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 25 - 28, 1993 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaAs {{technology}} progresses we {{are faced}} with ever increasing volumes and rates of raw and processed telemetry data along with digitized high resolution video and the less demanding areas of video conferencing, voice communications and general LAN-based data communications. The distribution of all this data has traditionally been accomplished by solutions designed to each particular data type. With the advent of <b>Asynchronous</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Modes</b> or ATM, a single technology now exists for providing an integrated solution to distributing these diverse data types. This allows an integrated set of switches, transmission equipment and fiber optics to provide multi-session connection speeds of 622 Megabits per second. ATM allows for the integration of many of the most widely used and emerging low, medium and high speed communications standards. These include SONET, FDDI, Broadband ISDN, Cell Relay, DS- 3, Token Ring and Ethernet LANs. However, ATM is also very well suited to handle unique data formats and speeds, {{as is often the case}} with telemetry data. Additionally, ATM is the only data communications technology in recent times to be embraced by both the computer and telecommunications industries. Thus, ATM is a single solution for connectivity within a test center, across a test range, or between ranges. ATM can be implemented in an evolutionary manner as the needs develop. This means the rate of capital investment can be gradual and older technologies can be replaced slowly as they become the communications bottlenecks. However, success of this evolution requires some planning now. This paper provides an overview of ATM, its application to test ranges and telemetry distribution. A road map is laid out which can guide the evolutionary changeover from today's technologies to a full ATM communications infrastructure. Special applications such as the support of high performance multimedia workstations are presented...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Experimental {{measurements}} {{have been}} made to investigate meaning of the change in voltage for the pulse gas metal arc welding (GMAW-P) process operating under different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>modes.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments with different values of pulsing parameter and simultaneous recording of high speed camera pictures and welding signals (such as current and voltage) were used to identify different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>modes</b> in GMAW-P. The investigation is based on the synchronization of welding signals and high speed camera to study the behaviour of voltage signal under different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>modes.</b> Findings: The results reveal that the welding arc is significantly affected by the molten droplet detachment. In fact, results indicate that sudden increase and drop in voltage just before and after the drop detachment can be used to characterize the voltage behaviour of different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>mode</b> in GMAW-P. Research limitations/implications: The results show that voltage signal carry rich information about different drop transfer occurring in GMAW-P. Hence it’s possible to detect different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>modes.</b> Future work should concentrate on development of filters for detection of different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>modes.</b> Originality/value: Determination of drop <b>transfer</b> <b>mode</b> with GMAW-P is crucial for the appropriate selection of pulse welding parameters. As change in drop <b>transfer</b> <b>mode</b> results in poor weld quality in GMAW-P, so in order to estimate the working parameters and ensure stable GMAW-P understanding the voltage behaviour of different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>modes</b> in GMAW-P will be useful. However, in case of GMAW-P hardly any attempt is made to analyse the behaviour of voltage signal for different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>modes.</b> This paper analyses the voltage signal behaviour of different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>modes</b> for GMAW-P...|$|R
