5|$|In 1779, father Baghdasar vardapet {{decorated}} the narthex walls with frescoes of King Abgar V, Theodosius I, Saint Gayane, Hripsime, Khosrovidukht, <b>and</b> <b>Gabriel.</b> According to Murad Hasratyan, the unknown painter had fused together the styles of Armenian, Persian, and Western European art.|$|E
5|$|Like many {{prominent}} French composers of the period, Massenet {{became a}} professor at the Conservatoire. He taught composition there from 1878 until 1896, when he resigned after the death of the director, Ambroise Thomas. Among his students were Gustave Charpentier, Ernest Chausson, Reynaldo Hahn <b>and</b> <b>Gabriel</b> Pierné.|$|E

5|$|After the British were defeated, more French Creole {{families}} evaded Anglo-American rule {{by moving}} to the Spanish-controlled land on the west bank, including wealthy merchants Charles Gratiot, Sr. <b>and</b> <b>Gabriel</b> Cerre. Both the Gratiot and Cerre families intermarried with the Chouteau family to create a Creole-dominated society in the 1780s and 1790s. The families also had marital ties to Spanish government officials, including the lieutenant governors Piernas and Cruzat.|$|E
5|$|Being Cristian Nemescu's last {{completed}} project, {{the film}} stars Mădălina Ghiţescu as Marilena <b>and</b> <b>Gabriel</b> Huian as Andrei. Originally, {{the film was}} intended to be used as an exercise, and was not supposed to be longer than seven minutes. In the end, the project evolved to an unusual length of 45minutes; the film's approach also turned from comedy to teenage love. Reception from the public was favorable – it impressed through its unitary view and the way the screenplay, picture and sound combine together into a new and organic way, by using innovative, unusual techniques.|$|E
5|$|By 1725, {{the castle}} had become ruinous. Early in the century, {{the remains of}} the castle was sold to the town of Weymouth, whose people reused some of the stone to {{construct}} their new town bridge. Local tradition in the 19th century maintained that several houses in Weymouth were also constructed using stone taken from the castle. In 1825, the carved stone Elizabethan arms of the castle were moved to All Saints Church in Wyke Regis. Captains continued to be formally appointed, however, <b>and</b> <b>Gabriel</b> Stewart held the post as late as 1795.|$|E

5|$|Four {{players have}} scored two hat-tricks in World Cup matches: Sándor Kocsis (both 1954); Just Fontaine (both 1958); Gerd Müller (both 1970); <b>and</b> <b>Gabriel</b> Batistuta (1994 and 1998). Batistuta is thus {{the only person}} to score hat-tricks in two World Cups. He has another unique record of scoring hat-tricks, both were {{achieved}} on 21 June of the year, against World Cup finals debutants (Greece and Jamaica), and each time the third goal was a penalty. Kocsis and Müller scored their hat-tricks in consecutive matches.|$|E
5|$|George Koval's father, Abram Koval, {{left his}} home town of Telekhany in Belarus to immigrate to the United States in 1910. Abram, a carpenter, settled in Sioux City, Iowa, which {{at the turn of}} the 20th century was home to a {{sizeable}} Jewish population of merchants and craftsmen. He and his wife Ethel Shenitsky Koval raised three sons: Isaya, born 1912; George (or Zhorzh), born Christmas 1913; <b>and</b> <b>Gabriel,</b> born 1919.|$|E

Since they were younger, Calixto {{always had a}} crush on Lupe and he became her boyfriend and later husband. Shortly after the ship explosion, he <b>and</b> Lupe found <b>Gabriel</b> <b>and</b> left Salvacion to live a {{peaceful}} life. They raised <b>Gabriel</b> <b>and</b> loved him as his own. Calixto and Lupe became his parent-figures.|$|R

5|$|If {{there is}} a halo effect {{spreading}} to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. LeBel and Campbell tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners. DeHart, Pelham, Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, <b>and</b> <b>Gabriel</b> concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship relationships as well.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his management of the proprietary, Martin began taking {{an active role in}} political and civil affairs within his uncle's domain. Following an act of the Virginia General Assembly in February 1752, the Anglican Frederick Parish was authorized to hold an election for twelve parish vestrymen before June 15 of that year. Martin was elected as a vestryman, alongside his uncle Lord Fairfax <b>and</b> <b>Gabriel</b> Jones. Martin and his fellow vestrymen set about expanding and enlarging the Anglican presence within the parish.|$|E
5|$|Mozart did {{not write}} down a cadenza for the movement, or at least there is no {{evidence}} of him having done so. Many later composers and performers, including Johannes Brahms, Ferruccio Busoni <b>and</b> <b>Gabriel</b> Fauré, have composed their own. Uniquely among Mozart's concertos, the score does not direct the soloist to end the cadenza with a cadential trill. The omission of the customary trill is likely to have been deliberate, with Mozart choosing to have the cadenza connect directly to the coda without one.|$|E

5|$|The {{founding}} members of Genesis, singer Peter Gabriel, keyboardist Tony Banks, guitarist Anthony Phillips, bassist and guitarist Mike Rutherford, and drummer Chris Stewart, met at Charterhouse School, {{a private school}} in Godalming, Surrey. Banks <b>and</b> <b>Gabriel</b> arrived at the school in September 1963, Rutherford in September 1964, and Phillips in April 1965. The five were members {{in one of the}} school's two bands; Phillips and Rutherford were in The Anon with singer Richard Macphail, bassist Rivers Jobe, and drummer Rob Tyrell, while Gabriel, Banks, and Stewart made up Garden Wall.|$|E
5|$|After much fanfare, Muhammad departs jannah airport, {{riding a}} buraq, or winged horse. The Archangel Gabriel accompanies him. On the way, they {{encounter}} a Soviet spacecraft. Hearing {{that they are}} infidels, Muhammad approaches to investigate, only to crash into the spacecraft, obliterating it and the buraq and killing the three cosmonauts; Muhammad <b>and</b> <b>Gabriel</b> are able to catch a cloud. Later, they pass Jakarta, which Gabriel describes as the most sinful place on Earth. Angered by Gabriel's statement that less than a million of Indonesia's 90 million Muslims are true believers, {{as well as the}} fact that it is the birthplace of Nasakom, Muhammad declares that Islam will never die and waits on the cloud.|$|E
5|$|Francis Penny Burnage, {{son-in-law}} of Charles, became {{chairman of}} Charles Churchill & Co, <b>and</b> <b>Gabriel</b> {{continued to work}} for that company. They moved quickly to add manufacturing capacity to what {{would otherwise have been}} just a sales organisation: in December 1934 the company took over Cornelius Redman & Sons, renaming it Churchill-Redman Ltd. The facility was used initially to manufacture American machine tools under licence, rather as the machine tool company had started out in the early 1900s. A particularly notable example of its output was the licence granted in 1937 by Jones & Lamson of Springfield, Vermont, for the Fay automatic lathe. It was to become a pattern for Gabriel to orchestrate take-overs of other companies but not subsume them: they would have their own management team and retain a separate corporate identity.|$|E

5|$|Kipandjikusmin {{later wrote}} to Ekspres {{magazine}} that his goal {{in writing the}} short story was to expose the corruption in Sukarno's government, focusing on the religious leaders who had agreed with Nasakom when it was politically expedient to do so, yet turned against the PKI when the party was hunted and its members killed. He also admitted the influences proposed by Jassin, writing that he had often thought of the Catholic heaven as being similar to the Javanese Kahyangan, with God being similar to Batara Guru. His depictions of Muhammad <b>and</b> <b>Gabriel</b> transforming into eagles were influenced by images of Christ as the Lamb of God. It was originally {{meant to be a}} serial, and Jassin had already received the second instalment by the time the controversy began.|$|E
5|$|La Purisima Concepcion de la Virgen Maria Parish Church (also The Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary Parish Church), {{commonly}} known as Baclayon Church, is a Roman Catholic Church in the municipality of Baclayon, Bohol, Philippines within {{the jurisdiction of the}} Roman Catholic Diocese of Tagbilaran. Baclayon was founded by the Jesuit priest Juan de Torres <b>and</b> <b>Gabriel</b> Sánchez in 1596, and became the oldest Christian settlement in Bohol. It was elevated as a parish in 1717 and the present coral stone church was completed in 1727. The Augustinian Recollects succeeded the Jesuits in 1768 and heavily renovated the church since then.|$|E
5|$|Leicester possessed one of {{the largest}} {{collections}} of paintings in Elizabethan England, being the first great private collector. He was a principal patron of Nicholas Hilliard, as well as interested in all aspects of Italian culture. The Earl's circle of scholars and men of letters included, among others, his nephew Philip Sidney, the astrologer and Hermeticist John Dee, his secretaries Edward Dyer and Jean Hotman, as well as John Florio <b>and</b> <b>Gabriel</b> Harvey. Through Harvey, Edmund Spenser found employment at Leicester House on the Strand, the Earl's palatial town house, where he wrote his first works of poetry. Many years after Leicester's death Spenser wistfully recalled this time in his Prothalamion, and in 1591 he remembered the late Earl with his poem The Ruins of Time.|$|E
