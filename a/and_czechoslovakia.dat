5|$|After the Second World War {{ended in}} 1945, Hampden started to host Scotland matches more frequently. Before then, Hampden had only hosted 15 matches against England and one match each against Austria <b>and</b> <b>Czechoslovakia.</b> During the post-war {{attendance}} boom, Hampden {{was the only}} stadium big enough to host the crowds who {{wanted to see the}} team. Matches that would have ordinarily attracted a crowd of 40,000 were being attended by nearly 100,000. The Hampden fixture list was also expanded by the new Scottish League Cup competition. In 1947, Rangers defeated Aberdeen in the first League Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1930s, Nazi Germany made {{increasingly}} aggressive territorial demands, threatening war {{if they were not}} met. It seized Austria <b>and</b> <b>Czechoslovakia</b> in 1938 and 1939. Hitler made a non-aggression pact with Joseph Stalin and invaded Poland in September 1939, launching World War II in Europe. In alliance with Italy and smaller Axis powers, Germany conquered most of Europe by 1940 and threatened Great Britain. Reichskommissariats took control of conquered areas and a German administration was established in what was left of Poland. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned, murdered in Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps, or shot.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, U.S. President Warren G. Harding {{received}} {{her at the}} White House to present her with the 1 gram of radium collected in the United States. Before the meeting, recognising her growing fame abroad, and embarrassed {{by the fact that}} she had no French official distinctions to wear in public, the French government offered her a Legion of Honour award, but she refused. In 1922 she became a fellow of the French Academy of Medicine. She also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, <b>and</b> <b>Czechoslovakia.</b>|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} fall of Phnom Penh to Vietnamese forces and their Kampuchean allies in January 1979, representatives of Democratic Kampuchea called for an {{emergency}} meeting of the United Nations Security Council, so Prince Norodom Sihanouk could present the deposed regime's case. Despite strong objections from the Soviet Union <b>and</b> <b>Czechoslovakia,</b> the UN Security Council gave Sihanouk this chance. Although Sihanouk distanced himself from the human rights abuses of the Khmer Rouge, he accused Vietnam of using aggression to violate Kampuchea’s sovereignty. As such, he demanded all UN countries to suspend aid to Vietnam and not recognise the Vietnamese-installed regime. Subsequently, seven non-aligned members of the UN Security Council submitted a draft resolution calling for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea, which was endorsed by the People's Republic of China, France, Norway, Portugal, the United States and the United Kingdom. However, the resolution was not approved due to strong opposition from the Soviet Union <b>and</b> <b>Czechoslovakia.</b> Ted Galen Carpenter, a foreign policy analyst from the Cato Institute argues that Vietnam did not invade Cambodia out of any noble desire to stop the atrocities committed by Pol Pot's regime but rather to consolidate their domination of Indochina.|$|E
5|$|The Panzer IV was {{partially}} succeeded by the Panther medium tank, which {{was introduced to}} counter the Soviet T-34, although the Panzer IV continued as a significant component of German armoured formations {{to the end of}} the war. The Panzer IV was the most widely exported tank in German service, with around 300 sold to Finland, Romania, Spain and Bulgaria. After the war, Syria procured Panzer IVs from France <b>and</b> <b>Czechoslovakia,</b> which saw combat in the 1967 Six-Day War. 8,553 Panzer IVs of all versions were built during World War II, with only the StuG III assault-gun/tank destroyer's 10,086 vehicle production run exceeding the Panzer IV's total among Axis armored forces.|$|E
5|$|The first {{victims were}} a few {{thousand}} men arrested in July 1941 and brought from Riga Central Prison.

In 1943 and onwards Nazis dug up graves and burned the bodies to hide the evidence. It is estimated {{that there are now}} around 20,000 victims buried in the forest.|$|E

5|$|Webster's first {{priority}} was {{to appoint a}} musical director to build the company from scratch. He negotiated with Bruno Walter and Eugene Goossens, but neither of those conductors was willing to consider an opera company with no leading international stars. Webster appointed a little-known Austrian, Karl Rankl, to the post. Before the war, Rankl had acquired considerable experience in charge of opera companies in Germany, Austria <b>and</b> <b>Czechoslovakia.</b> He accepted Webster's invitation to assemble and train the principals and chorus of a new opera company, alongside a permanent orchestra that would play in both operas and ballets.|$|E

5|$|At the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, the Soviet {{team won}} all seven of its games, earning the gold medal. Canada {{finished}} the tournament with five wins and two losses, putting {{the team in}} a three-way tie for second place with Sweden <b>and</b> <b>Czechoslovakia.</b> Before 1964, the tie-breaking procedure was based on goal difference in games against teams in the medal round; under that system, Canada would have placed third ahead of the Czechoslovakian team. During the tournament the procedure was changed to take all games into consideration, which meant that the Canadians finished fourth. At the time, the Olympics counted as the World Championships; under their (unchanged) rules, Canada should have received bronze for the World Championships.|$|E

5|$|By April, {{resistance}} against the Third Army was tapering off, and the forces' main efforts turned to managing some 400,000 German prisoners of war. On April 14, 1945 Patton {{was promoted to}} general, a promotion long advocated by Stimson in recognition of Patton's battle accomplishments during 1944. Later that month, Patton, Bradley and Eisenhower toured the Merkers salt mine {{as well as the}} Ohrdruf concentration camp, and seeing the conditions of the camp firsthand caused Patton great disgust. Third Army was ordered toward Bavaria <b>and</b> <b>Czechoslovakia,</b> anticipating a last stand by Nazi German forces there. He was reportedly appalled to learn the Red Army would take Berlin, feeling the Soviet Union was a threat to the U.S. army's advance to Pilsen, but was stopped by Eisenhower from reaching Prague before V-E Day on May 8 {{and the end of the}} war in Europe.|$|E
5|$|During high school, Williams played several sports competitively. He {{attended}} Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, {{and graduated}} with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and economics in 1937. He served as the vice-president of his senior class {{and was a member}} of the Kappa Alpha Order. Like his older brother, Manning Holland Williams, he earned his degree after three years and was admitted to Phi Beta Kappa. At the age of 19, Williams enrolled at Harvard Business School, receiving his Master of Business Administration degree two years later. Following his graduation from Harvard Business School, Williams worked in the loan department at Manufacturers Trust Company in New York City for two years. Williams traveled to Europe, in 1937 and 1939, visiting Germany, Austria <b>and</b> <b>Czechoslovakia.</b> Prior to this experience, Williams was an avowed pacifist, but after visiting Nazi Germany he felt obligated to enlist in the United States Navy.|$|E
5|$|From 1921, {{the country}} had {{negotiated}} the Little Entente with Romania <b>and</b> <b>Czechoslovakia</b> {{in the face of}} Hungarian designs on its territory, and after a decade of bilateral treaties, had formalised the arrangements in 1933. This had been followed the following year by the Balkan Entente of Yugoslavia, Greece, Romania and Turkey, aimed at thwarting Bulgarian aspirations. Throughout this period, the Yugoslav government had sought to remain good friends with France, seeing her as a guarantor of European peace treaties. This was formalised through a treaty of friendship signed in 1927. With these arrangements in place, Italy posed the biggest problem for Yugoslavia, funding the anti-Yugoslav Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation which promoted Bulgarian irredentism. Attempts by King Alexander to negotiate with Benito Mussolini fell on deaf ears, and after Alexander's assassination, nothing of note happened on that front until 1937. In the aftermath of Alexander's assassination, Yugoslavia was isolated both militarily and diplomatically, and reached out to France to assist its bilateral relationship with Italy.|$|E

5|$|In early 1964 Sihanouk {{signed a}} secret {{agreement}} with North Vietnam and the Viet Cong, allowing Chinese military aid meant {{for them to}} be delivered through Sihanoukville's port. In turn, the Cambodian army would be paid for delivering food supplies to the Viet Cong, {{and at the same time}} skim off 10percent of all military hardware supplies. In addition, he also allowed the Viet Cong to build a trail through eastern Cambodia, so that their troops could receive war supplies from North Vietnam. The trail later became known as the Sihanouk Trail. When the US learned of Viet Cong presence in eastern Cambodia, they started a bombing campaign over it, spurring Sihanouk to sever diplomatic ties with the US in May 1965. As a result of this secret agreement, Communist countries, including China, the Soviet Union, <b>and</b> <b>Czechoslovakia,</b> provided military aid to Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{was born}} Rudolph Muller in the Moravian city of Kroměřížthen known as Kremsier in Austria-Hungaryon 2 September 1899.

At the {{outbreak}} of World War II he fled Austria to escape the persecution of the Jews and arrived in London in March 1939 to pursue a career in the British theatre and film industry.

5|$|On 31 October 1918, {{at the end}} of World War I and the {{dissolution}} of Austria-Hungary, the majority of the area was taken over by local Polish authorities supported by armed forces. The interim agreement of 2 November 1918 reflected the inability of the two national councils to come to final delimitation. On 5 November 1918, the area was divided between Poland <b>and</b> <b>Czechoslovakia</b> by an interim agreement of two local self-government councils (Czech Zemský národní výbor pro Slezsko and Polish Rada Narodowa Księstwa Cieszyńskiego). Before that, the majority of the area was taken over by Polish local authorities. In 1919 both councils were absorbed by the newly created and independent central governments in Prague and Warsaw. The former was not satisfied with this compromise and on 23 January 1919 invaded the area while Poland was engaged in its war against the West Ukrainian National Republic.|$|E
