40|$|Abstract — Laser {{detection}} and tracking of aircrafts based systems (LIDARs, LIgth Detection And Ranging systems) are {{emerging as a}} critical design trend in development of new generation ATM (Air Traffic Management) paradigms, {{of which they are}} the main innovations. The realization of laser sensors as rotating laser range-finder arrays and their combination to versatile systems lead to major advantages for the application such as Air Traffic Control within <b>Aerodrome</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Zone</b> (ATZ), airport surveillance and ground to air laser communications, and last but not least to save cost usually at the same time with getting an improved ATC (Air Traffic Control) performance. These laser systems that today can be developed without particular difficulties are challenging classical ATM paradigms in many aspects. Nevertheless, it is commonly recognized that the effectiveness of these systems strictly relies on the capability to reliably perform a track data fusion with airpor...|$|E

The proposed methodology is considered at the frontier of technological research but it represents the only realistic way to put solid basis for the fabrication of effective radar and lidar integrated systems for incorporation in new generation ATM paradigms...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the recent research activities aimed at developing a flexible and low-cost measurement {{system for the}} determination of aviation-related pollutant concentrations in dense air traffic areas. The proposed bistatic Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system includes an airborne component and a ground-based component. The airborne component consists of a tuneable laser emitter installed on an Unmanned Aircraft (UA) and the ground-based component is constituted by a target surface calibrated for reflectance and a rail-mounted camera calibrated for radiance. The system performs Differential Absorption LIDAR (DIAL) measurements. The specific implementation for the measurement of CO 2 in the <b>aerodrome</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>zone</b> of a major airport is studied in this paper. The analytical and empirical models to directly estimate the extinction coefficients are also presented and uncertainty analysis is performed for a preliminary validation of the bistatic DIAL system. The relevant opportunities and challenges, and {{the viability of the}} system in the intended operational domains are also discussed. The presented numerical results show satisfactory performances in term of accuracy and precision even in degraded meteorological conditions, which are comparable to the more complex and relatively costly techniques currently available...|$|E

A novel laser tracking technology (SKY-Scanner System) capable to detect and track of aircrafts up to at least 6 nautical miles from the <b>Aerodrome</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Zone</b> (ATZ) has been proposed. The proposed methodology is considered at the frontier of technological research but it represents the only realistic way to put solid basis for the fabrication of effective radar and lidar integrated systems for incorporation in new generation ATM paradigms. The present paper is mainly focused on the simulation software of the above mentioned system. The simulation software is necessary in order to predict the behavior that the system, which is currently under development, will have. The software consists of two modules: Sim-module and Scen-module, both integrated in a single software package. The Sim-module simulates the mechanical system, the interaction of the laser with atmosphere, and the reflection {{on the surface of the}} airplane. The Monte-Carlo method will be used in order to take into account of random variables involved in the system, for example noise, turbulence, and error in mechanical positioning system of the lidar. The Scen-module simulates a scenery in which one or more aircraft will move along trajectories the user will specify...|$|E
