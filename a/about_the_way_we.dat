[...] Theron Martin of Anime News Network considered it a story about [...] "trying {{to find a way to}} cope with a devastating loss". According to Katherine Dacey, the former senior manga editor for PopCultureShock, 12 Days contains [...] "lovely, quiet observations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> grieve, define family, express desire, and remember moments of hurt and betrayal." [...] Johanna Draper Carlson, a reviewer for Publishers Weekly, wrote that Jackie's action of consuming the ashes serves as [...] "a transition period, a way to indulge her grief and then a time to be able to be herself again."

According to Ernie C, [...] "Everybody writes about whatever they learned growing up, and we were no exception. Like The Beach Boys sing about the beach, we sing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> grew up." [...] Ice-T states that [...] "Body Count was an angry record. It {{was meant to be}} a protest record. I put my anger in it, while lacing it with dark humor." [...] The spoken introduction, [...] "Smoked Pork" [...] features Ice-T taking on the roles of a gangster pretending to be seemingly stranded motorist and a police officer who refuses to aid. The track begins with Mooseman and Ice-T driving their car towards a police car, and then Ice-T asks for the gun Mooseman has and tells Mooseman to stay in the car, much to Mooseman's chagrin, as Mooseman wanted to kill the cop in this round. Ice-T then walks up to the policeman, pretending to be a stranded motorist, asking for help, but the policeman refuses, saying: [...] "Nah, that's not my job! My job's not to help your fuckin' ass out!", then telling him that [...] "my job is eatin' these doughnuts". When the officer recognizes Ice-T, gunshots are heard.

[...] It also has a 73 out of 100 rating based on 31 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews", at Metacritic. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post called the film [...] "outrageously profane" [...] and [...] "wildly funny", writing that [...] "While censorship is the filmmakers' main target [...] favorite monster is the Motion Picture Association of America, self-appointed guardians of the nation's chastity. It's all in good dirty fun and in service of their pro-tolerance theme." [...] Stephen Holden of The New York Times heavily praised the film, regarding the film's [...] "self-justifying moral" [...] as [...] "about mass entertainment, censorship and freedom of speech." [...] He also praised Cartman's subjection to the V-chip, which he called [...] "the movie's sharpest satirical twist, reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange". Entertainment Weekly graded the film an A− and praised the film's message in a post-Columbine society, as well as Parker and Shaiman's musical numbers, which [...] "brilliantly parody / honor the conventions of Broadway show tunes and, especially, the Disney-formula ditties that began with Alan Menken and Howard Ashman." [...] The Washington Post Michael O'Sullivan neutrally regarded the offensive nature of the film, commenting [...] "Yes, the lampooning is more broad than incisive, but under the bludgeoning of this blunt instrument very few sacred cows are left standing." [...] In a review that was later quoted on the film's original home video cover, Richard Corliss from Time warned viewers [...] "You may laugh yourself sick – as sick as this ruthlessly funny movie is." [...] Corliss would later name the film his fifth favorite animated film of all time. The film had {{its fair share of}} critical detractors, without noting the conservative family groups offended by the film's humor. Jack Matthews of the Daily News suggested the film's running time made Parker and Stone [...] "run out of ideas", while Roger Ebert stated that the [...] "vicious social satire" [...] of the film both [...] "offended" [...] and [...] "amazed" [...] him. Ebert called the film [...] "the year's most slashing political commentary", but also said, [...] "It is too long and runs out of steam, but it serves as a signpost for our troubled times.

40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{concerned}} with finding out about mental health patients - taking this term at the outset - and exploring how their stories might be found in different places from 1912. It considers, then, the shifting identities of patients over time, as well as exploring issues around how historians might productively locate stories and narratives of mental illness, hospitalisation, recovery, and sometimes, cycles of these. Overall, it situates Tokanui patients in a wider framework for mental health histories in New Zealand and seeks to find their stories among the many accounts of mental illness. Where the previous chapter considered changing modalities for treatment, and told patient stories sensitively to capture this {{from the perspective of}} a practising psychiatrist, this chapter is written from the point of patients, but also mediated by the view of the historian. It therefore asks readers to think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> tell stories of mental health, as much as <b>about</b> <b>the</b> stories themselves...|$|R

The senescence period brings numerous changes, health and social problems, period which must be anticipated humanely and sustained financially. The concept of “active ageing” targets the optimization of health and security opportunities, thus improving the quality of life for the elderly. The word “active” refers to the continuous involvement of the aged persons in the economic, social, cultural and spiritual life. Once retired, they can actively contribute to the wellness of the family and community to which they belong, and the purpose of active ageing is to increase the lifespan and life quality of the oldpeople, including the ones which suffer from handicaps. ...|$|R
