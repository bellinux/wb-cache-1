5|$|The {{first people}} {{to write about the}} May Revolution were {{participants}} who wrote memoirs, biographies and diaries. However, their works were motivated by purposes other than historiographic ones, such as to explain the reasons for their actions, clean their public images, or express their support or rejection of the public figures and ideas of the time. For example, Manuel Moreno wrote the biography of his brother Mariano as propaganda for the revolutions in Europe, and Cornelio Saavedra wrote his autobiography <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> his image was highly questioned, to justify himself to his sons.|$|E
5|$|The view of some modern {{scholars}} {{that the}} 4th-century cavalry {{was a more}} efficient service than the infantry was certainly not shared by Ammianus and his contemporaries. Ammianus describes three major battles which were actually or nearly lost due to the incompetence or cowardice of the Roman cavalry. (1) The Battle of Strasbourg (357), where the cavalry, including cataphracts, were routed by their German counterparts at an early stage, leaving the Roman infantry right wing dangerously exposed. After fleeing behind the infantry lines, it took the personal intervention of Julian to rally them and persuade them {{to return to the}} fight. (The cataphracts were later ordered to wear female clothes by Julian as punishment). (2) During his Persian campaign (363), Julian was obliged to sanction two cavalry units for fleeing when caught by surprise attacks (one unit was decimated, the other dismounted). Later, the Tertiaci cavalry regiment was ordered to march with the camp followers for deserting the field just as the infantry was on the point of breaking the Persian line. (3) At the Battle of Adrianople (378), the Roman cavalry was largely responsible for the catastrophic defeat. Scholae units started the battle by an unauthorised attack on the enemy wagon circle, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> their emperor Valens was still trying to negotiate a truce with the Goths. The attack failed, and when the Gothic cavalry appeared, the Roman cavalry fled, leaving the Roman infantry left wing exposed. The Gothic cavalry then routed the Roman left wing, and the battle was as good as lost.|$|E

25|$|The {{constitution}} of Grattan's parliament offered no security, as the differences over the regency question had made evident that {{in matters of}} imperial interest {{the policy of the}} Irish parliament and that of Great Britain would be in agreement. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> Britain was engaged in a life-and-death struggle with France, it was impossible for the ministry to ignore the danger, recently emphasised {{by the fact that the}} independent {{constitution of}} 1782 offered no safeguard against armed revolt. Sectarian violence during the rebellion put an end to the growing reconciliation between Roman Catholics and Presbyterians, and the island divided anew into two hostile factions.|$|E

Traveling through Italy he visited Vicenza, Verona, Mantua and Venice, the places where he made the longest stays. He made drawings of the Greek temples at Paestum (Loukomski 1928) and finally arrived in Rome in 1763, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> Neoclassicism was being developed in advanced artistic circles. He studied painting with Anton Raphael Mengs, then with Stefano Pozzi, later moving to study architecture (1767–69) with a traditionalist Late Baroque architect Paolo Posi.|$|E

25|$|If {{the first}} {{appearance}} of this column had caused alarm and perplexity among the {{troops of the}} French left wing, the apprehensions it excited on the Prussian right, when its cavalry was observed to advance and to drive back Colonel Marwitz' Brigade, which had been sent towards it in reconnaissance (as already explained), were still greater; and its equally unexpected disappearance (with the exception of its cavalry, and a portion of its infantry), <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> {{it was felt that}} its vigorous co-operation must have rendered the issue of the battle no longer doubtful, was looked upon as a particularly fortunate turn of affairs; and Blücher's hopes revived as he prepared to carry into effect his meditated attack upon the French left flank.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon had {{undoubtedly}} {{gained the}} victory {{from the moment}} he succeeded in penetrating the Prussian centre; but it was not distinguished by that brilliant success, or by those immediate and decisive advantages, which might have been anticipated from the admirable manner in which the attack had been prepared, and the care with which it was concealed from the Prussians, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> they had no reserve remaining, and when the co-operation of Wellington's army on their right, or the arrival of IV Corps (Bülow's) from Hannut, had become quite impracticable. This appears the more surprising when we reflect that he had a considerable corps of cavalry under Grouchy at hand to support this attack, and that the whole of IV Corps (Lobau's) was on the field, fully prepared for active operations.|$|E
25|$|The bid was {{launched}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> there were strong pressures from Indonesian football fans for Halid {{to step down}} from his position as chairman of PSSI.

Secretary General of PSSI Nugraha Besoes did not deny that Indonesia could be disqualified from the bidding process because the Indonesian government did not support the bid. On 19 March 2010, FIFA rejected Indonesia's bid to host the 2022 World Cup because the government stated that their concern is {{for the people of the}} country and so could not support the bid as FIFA requested.

25|$|This {{same year}} of 572 Miro led an {{expedition}} against the Runcones. This movement took place <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> the Visigoth king Leovigild was conducting successful military {{activity in the}} south: he had recovered for the Visigoths the cities of Cordova and Medina-Sidonia, and had led a successful assault on the region around the city of Málaga.

Finally, in 576, he entered Galicia itself, disturbing {{the boundaries of the}} kingdom, but Miro sent ambassadors and obtained from Leovigild a temporary peace. It was probably during this period that the Suevi also sent some ambassadors to the Frankish king Gontram, who were intercepted by Chilperic I near Poitiers, being later imprisoned for a year, as recorded by Gregory of Tours.|$|E
25|$|Since 1632, France had {{regularly}} occupied Lorraine in {{periods of}} war, without annexing it. The duke, Charles IV, who was {{allied with the}} houses of Austria and Bavaria, adopted a policy hostile towards France. He and afterwards, his nephew, Charles V of Lorraine had been officers in the Imperial Austrian Army. It was only later that France was presented with both motive and a favourable occasion to annex the duchy. This was the marriage, in 1736, of Francis de Lorraine to the heiress of the Austrian imperial house, Archduchess Maria Theresa, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> Austria was weakened. The Treaty of Vienna (1738) awarded Lorraine to Louis XV of France, who gave it for life, to his father-in-law, Stanisław Leszczyński. The duchy of Lorraine would be formally annexed to France in 1766, when Stanisław died. In recompense, Duke Francis III was given the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, which was vacant.|$|E
25|$|The main {{criticism}} {{was that the}} temple was using fundraising methods that did not fit in with Buddhism. Examples that were pointed out were the fact that fundraising resembled direct sales, the distribution of amulets to donors as complementary gift {{and the use of}} modern technology. Scholars in Buddhism, such as Luang Por Payutto, social critic Sulak Sivaraksa, as well as two monks who formerly lived at the temple, all argued against the temple's fundraising methods. Moreover, some teachings of the temple were criticized: the idea that large donations yield greater fruits or merit, and the idea that Nibbana was the true self. (See § Principles, practices and beliefs) Although many of these methods and teachings were not unique to Wat Phra Dhammakaya, the criticism came <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> the temple had become very noticeable due to its size, its high-profile supporters, and due to the project of building the Cetiya, which required a lot of funds. And all of this at the backdrop of the financial crisis that Thailand was going through.|$|E

25|$|Things became awkward {{during the}} periods when {{a number of}} provinces refused to appoint a stadtholder (Friesland always had a stadtholder during these periods). During the First Stadtholderless Period the {{function}} of captain-general of the union was simply left vacant until the very end, in 1672, when William III was appointed, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> he was not yet a stadtholder. In this period the supreme command of the army was first entrusted to the Field-Marshal who was in office at the death of William II in 1650, Johan Wolfert van Brederode. But {{after his death in}} 1655 even this function was left vacant, because it was politically awkward for the States of Holland to appoint either of the candidates for the function, the Frisian stadtholder William Frederick, or John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen. The latter was however appointed to the position in 1668, together with the Holstein general Paulus Wirtz as second Field-Marshal, in view of the advanced age of John Maurice. Henceforth the States Army usually had two Field-Marshals, and after 1689 for a short time even three (when Henry Casimir II, Prince of Nassau-Dietz was appointed to the function; he resigned, however, when he did not receive the appointment of first Field-Marshal after the death of Waldeck in 1692).|$|E

500|$|Mercia's {{influence}} in Kent was limited {{both before and}} during Coenred's reign. In a surviving letter (written in 704 or 705), Waldhere, Bishop of London, tells Berhtwald, Archbishop of Canterbury, that Coenred had invited him to a council to be held [...] "about the reconciliation of Ælfthryth". Waldhere refused the invitation as {{he did not know}} Berhtwald's opinion on the matter, which was evidently important, although no other reference to it has survived.

In the view of the historian Frank Stenton, the letter illuminates the [...] "confused relations of the southern English <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> they had no common overlord". The reduced prestige of both Coenred and his successor, Ceolred, may have stirred unrest among the Mercian nobility: Æthelbald was in exile during Ceolred's reign, and the survival of a hostile account of Ceolred may indicate a more general dissatisfaction with the ruling line.|$|E
