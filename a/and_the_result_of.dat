5|$|Many {{churches in}} the city (including the Church of the Resurrection or Holy Sepulchre) were burned, and {{numerous}} relics, including the True Cross, the Holy Lance, and the Holy Sponge, were carried off to the Persian capital Ctesiphon. The loss of these relics was thought by many Christian Byzantines to be a clear mark of divine displeasure. Some blamed the Jews for this misfortune and {{for the loss of}} Syria in general. There were reports that Jews helped the Persians capture certain cities and that the Jews tried to slaughter Christians in cities that the Persians had already conquered but were found and foiled from doing so. These reports are likely to be greatly exaggerated <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> general hysteria.|$|E
5|$|Ragtime was a {{style of}} dance music based around the piano, using syncopated rhythms and chromaticisms; the genre's most {{well-known}} performer and composer was undoubtedly Scott Joplin. Donald Clarke considers ragtime the culmination of coon songs, used first in minstrel shows and then vaudeville, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the rhythms of minstrelsy percolating into the mainstream; he also suggests that ragtime's distinctive sound {{may have come from}} an attempt to imitate the African American banjo using the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six-man tag team match pitting {{the team of}} Rhino and Team 3D against the team of Jeff Jarrett and America's Most Wanted. The latter was {{accompanied}} by Gail Kim. Various weapons were used by both teams throughout the match without the referee disqualifying either. Some weapons used included trash cans, cheese graters, and tables. Rhino tackled Jarrett with his signature Gore maneuver late in the match, but the pin was broken up by AMW. This led to Team 3D throwing Harris {{out of the ring}} and performing their signature 3D tag team maneuver, slamming Storm onto the mat. They followed with the pin to win the contest at 15 minutes and 48 seconds. After the contest, Jarrett attacked Rhino by bashing him over the head with a guitar. Jarrett, AMW, and Team Canada then proceeded to assault Rhino and Team 3D until Christian Cage came out to the ring. Cage attacked Coach Scott D'Amore and aided Rhino and Team 3D is fighting off Jarrett, AMW, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> Team Canada.|$|E

The TSHr is expressed on the follicular {{cells of the}} thyroid gland (the cells that produce thyroid hormone), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> chronic stimulation is an abnormally high production of T3 and T4. This, in turn, causes the clinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism, and the enlargement of the thyroid gland visible as goiter.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, the Conservative—Liberal Democrat {{coalition}} government agreed {{to hold a}} national referendum on the alternative vote, held on 5 May 2011.

25|$|In {{order to}} explain the {{aberration}} of light <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the Fizeau experiment in accordance with Maxwell's equations, Lorentz in 1892 developed a model ("Lorentz ether theory") in which the aether is completely motionless, and {{the speed of light}} in the aether is constant in all directions.

25|$|Sergius’ {{ties with}} the family of Theophylact were made even closer, at least {{according}} to rumour, by Sergius’ supposed affair with Theophylact’s daughter, Marozia. This relationship was promoted by Marozia’s mother, Theodora, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> this affair was a male child who in time became Pope John XI (931–935). The only source of this affair is the chronicler Liutprand of Cremona, writing some 50 years after the events of Sergius’ pontificate.

25|$|Despite this evidence, the {{surviving}} Hittite texts {{do not provide}} an independent account of the Trojan War. The Manapa-Tarhunda letter is about {{a member of the}} Hittite ruling family, Piyama-Radu, who gained control of the kingdom of Wilusa, and whose only serious opposition came from the author of this letter, Manapa-Tarhunda. King Muwatalli of the Hittites was the opponent of this king of Troy, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> Muwatalli's campaign is not recorded in {{the surviving}} texts. The Ahhiyawa, generally identified with the Achaean Greeks, are mentioned in the Tawagalawa letter as the neighbors of the kingdom of Wilusa, and who provided a refuge for the troublesome renegade Piyama-Radu. The Tawagalawa letter mentions that the Hittites and the Ahhiyawa fought a war over Wilusa.|$|E
25|$|Accusations {{of sexual}} excess were a {{tried and tested}} smear tactic <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> 'politically {{motivated}} hostility'. Two accounts especially have added to her notoriety. One {{is the story of}} her all-night sex competition with a prostitute in Book X of Pliny the Elder's Natural History, according to which the competition lasted for 24 hours and Messalina won with a score of 25 partners. The poet Juvenal gives an equally well known description in his sixth satire of how the Empress used to work clandestinely all night in a brothel under the name of the She-Wolf. He also alludes to the story of how she compelled Gaius Silius to divorce his wife and marry her in his Satire X.|$|E
25|$|The {{second game}} was played on 9 November 2014. The opening was the solid Berlin {{variation}} of the Ruy Lopez where Carlsen played 4.d3 instead of the main line 4.0-0 Nxe4. Carlsen gave up the bishop pair to double Anand's c-pawns <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the opening was roughly equal. However, Anand's moves 16...Rd8, 18...Be6, and 19...Ng6 all contributed to making his position more unpleasant. In the heavy-piece endgame Carlsen's active pieces and outpost on e6 gave him a clear advantage. The game ended abruptly when Anand blundered with 34...h5??, allowing 35.Qb7 forcing instant resignation, {{because there is no}} good defense to 36.Rxg7+ Kh8 37.Rh7+ Kg8 38.Qg7 with checkmate. 34...Qd2 was the way to fight on but Anand's chances of a successful defence were slim. Carlsen took the lead in the match.|$|E

25|$|Although ADHD has {{typically}} been conceptualized in a categorical diagnostic paradigm, it {{has also}} been proposed that this disorder should be considered within a more dimensional behavioural model that links executive functions to observed deficits. Proponents argue that classic conceptions of ADHD falsely localize the problem at perception (input) rather than focusing on the inner processes involved in producing appropriate behaviour (output). Moreover, others have theorized that the appropriate development of inhibition (something that is seen to be lacking in individuals with ADHD) is essential for the normal performance of other neuropsychological abilities such as working memory, and emotional self-regulation. Thus, within this model, deficits in inhibition are conceptualized to be developmental <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> atypically operating executive systems.|$|E
25|$|Quantum-enhanced machine {{learning}} refers to quantum algorithms that solve tasks in {{machine learning}}, thereby improving a classical machine learning method. Such algorithms typically require one to encode the given classical dataset into a quantum computer, {{so as to}} make it accessible for quantum information processing. After this, quantum information processing routines can be applied <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the quantum computation is read out by measuring the quantum system. For example, the outcome of the measurement of a qubit could reveal the result of a binary classification task. While many proposals of quantum machine learning algorithms are still purely theoretical and require a full-scale universal quantum computer to be tested, others have been implemented on small-scale or special purpose quantum devices.|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} {{production}} system, machines and apparatuses {{play an important}} role. What {{is referred to as}} capital is nothing other than these machines and apparatuses, together with materials and intermediate products consumed in the production process. Capital is the most important of factors, or one should say as important as labor. By the help of machines and apparatuses, the human being got a tremendous production capability. These machines, apparatuses and tools are classified as capital, or more precisely as durable capital, for one uses these items for many years. Their quantity is not changed at once. But the capital is not an endowment given by the nature. It is composed of goods manufactured in the production and often imported from foreign countries. In this sense, capital is internationally mobile <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> past economic activity. The concept of capital as natural endowment distorts the real role of capital. Capital is a production power accumulated by the past investment.|$|E
