25|$|The ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASEAN-SAM) is the region's {{aviation}} policy geared {{towards the}} development of a unified and single aviation market in Southeast Asia. The aviation policy was proposed by the ASEAN Air Transport Working Group, supported by the ASEAN Senior Transport Officials Meeting, and endorsed by the ASEAN Transport Ministers. The ASEAN-SAM is expected to liberalise air travel between member-states in the <b>ASEAN</b> <b>region,</b> allowing ASEAN airlines to benefit directly from the growth in air travel, and also free up tourism, trade, investment, and service flows between member states. Since 1 December 2008, restrictions on the third and fourth freedoms of the air between capital cities of member states for air passenger services have been removed, while from 1 January 2009, full liberalisation of air freight services in the region took effect. On 1 January 2011, full liberalisation on fifth freedom traffic rights between all capital cities took effect. The ASEAN Single Aviation Market policy supersedes existing unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral air services agreements among member states which are inconsistent with its provisions.|$|E

40|$|Why, {{following}} the EU’s first attempts at advancing community cooperation in civil protection {{and the creation}} of the EU civil protection mechanism, has ASEAN undertaken new initiatives, such as the adoption of a legally binding accord, AADMER and a formal institution, the AHA Center, largely comparable to the institutional innovations endorsed by the EU, in the same issue area? Can these developments be interpreted simply as the result of independent decision-making by ASEAN or are they at least a partial outcome of a transfer process? The aim {{of this study is to}} contribute to the emerging debate on European influence in Southeast Asia, taking into account how processes of policy and institutional transfer may lead <b>ASEAN’s</b> <b>region</b> builders to learn from the EU’s experience. Specifically, by discussing the case of disaster management, which has remained largely unexplored by comparative IR literature, this study argues that independent problem solving does not offer an adequate explanation of ASEAN’s developments. Conversely, lesson drawing and emulation are suggested as the two most relevant underlying mechanisms which can explain the gradual and selective adoption of an EU-like model of disaster cooperation...|$|R

The growth and other culturing efficiency of 25 juvenile grouper from each sample were recorded every 5 days for 45 days period. The data is analyzed with a one-way ANOVA and Duncan test using SAS 9. 1 program. The highest growth performance (absolute and specific growth) was observed at 32 psu being 0. 095 cm/day for absolute growth and 2. 26 % for specific growth in comparison to other salinity regimes (22 and 28 psu). Similarly the highest survival rate was observed at 32 psu and the lowest survival rate at 22 psu. Calculation of FCR values for tiger grouper in the present experiment agreed well with the positive culture efficiency at 32 psu. The results obtained from the present study suggested that the tiger grouper performed best growth and culture efficiency (Feeding Conversion Ratio and Survival Rate) at salinity of 32 psu kept in cage for commercial production) ...|$|R
