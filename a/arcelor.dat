In 2003, {{the company was}} {{dissolved}} and its assets, including its six massive plants, were acquired by the International Steel Group; the Bethlehem Steel Corporation did not merge with/into International Steel Group. International Steel Group was acquired by Mittal Steel in 2005, which merged with <b>Arcelor</b> to become ArcelorMittal in 2006. Since the Bethlehem Steel Corporation was dissolved instead of being merged into International Steel Group, the former company {{is not part of}} the former International Steel Group heritage, the former Mittal Steel's heritage and the current ArcelorMittal's heritage.|$|E
25|$|Serra {{has made}} a number of films {{concerning}} the manufacture and use of his favorite material, steel. Railroad Turnbridge (1976) is a series of shots taken on the Burlington and Northern bridge over the Willamette River near Portland, Oregon, as it opens to let a ship pass. In Steelmill/Stahlwerk, a 1979 documentary made in collaboration with Clara Weyergraf, Serra explores the physical construction of an art piece {{and at the same time}} examines the lives of the steelmill. These films can be viewed in a room off the <b>Arcelor</b> gallery in the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao.|$|E

The Belgian government, on the other hand, declared its stance as neutral and invited both parties to deliver a business plan with the future investments in research in the Belgian steel plants. The French opposition was initially very fierce and has been criticized in the British, American and Indian media as double standards and economic nationalism in Europe. Indian commerce minister Kamal Nath warned that any attempt by France to block the deal {{would lead to a}} trade war between India and France.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The use of {{quenched}} {{boron steel}} components {{is an economic}} way to achieve significant improvements in terms of weight saving and crash performance. The material and process know-ledge on the hot stamping of boron steels (e. g. <b>Arcelor’s</b> USIBOR 1500 P®) by the stampers needs to be extended and accurate simulation tools must be developed to support the growth of this forming technology. This paper simultaneously addresses the specific requirements of the hot stamping simulation and {{the current state of}} the art in this field. A specific approach is presented for the detection of the process limits within the simulation tool. A software chain has been set up with the target to decrease the computation times. Introduction: a short process sequence for high strength components In recent years, the steel industry has developed and industrialized a wide range of products with ever increasing strength. Even in the class of grades between 800 MPa and 1000 MPa, the sophisticated metallurgical routes guarantee a sufficient formability and weldability for good processing in the press and assembly shops. A major breakthrough has been reached by the use o...|$|R

2500|$|The Government of Canada {{published}} a [...] "Labour Market Bulletin" [...] for the Hamilton Area in 2006. The report states that Hamilton has {{a shortage of}} hotel facilities, truck drivers and finance professionals, {{all of which are}} in high demand. As well, 55% of the manufacturing workforce is expected to retire in the next 15-years and the Ontario government has injected millions of dollars into Hamilton's education sector. The steel industry also saw some highlights; Stelco emerged from bankruptcy protection and Dofasco has been taken over by <b>Arcelor.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As {{the largest}} steel {{manufacturing}} city in Canada and {{home of the}} two Steel giants; Stelco and Dofasco where 60% of all the steel in Canada is produced. It is the steel and metals manufacturing Capital of Canada. In the last decade, Hamilton's heavy industry reached a stable level, Stelco has returned to profitability and on August 26, 2007 United States Steel Corporation acquired Stelco for $38.50 (Canadian) in cash per share, owning more than 76 percent of Stelco's outstanding shares. Dofasco in 1999 was the most profitable steel producer in North America and in 2000 {{it was the most}} profitable in Canada. [...] It currently has approximately 7,300 employees at its Hamilton plant and produces over four million tons of steel annually, representing about 30% of Canada's flat rolled sheet steel shipments. Dofasco in addition to being one of North America's most profitable steel companies, Dofasco has been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index seven years in a row. [...] Dofasco’s wide range of steel products is sold to customers in the automotive, construction, energy, manufacturing, pipe and tube, appliance, packaging and steel distribution industries. Dofasco is currently a stand alone subsidiary of <b>Arcelor</b> Mittal, the world's largest steel producer. Previously ordered by the U.S. Department of Justice to divest itself of the Canadian company, <b>Arcelor</b> Mittal has now been allowed to retain Dofasco provided it sells several of its American assets instead.|$|E
2500|$|In May and June 2006, Russian media cited {{discrimination}} against Russian companies as one possible {{reason why the}} contemplated merger between the Luxembourg-based steelmaker <b>Arcelor</b> and Russia's Severstal did not finalize. According to the Russian daily Izvestiya, those opposing the merger [...] "exploited the 'Russian threat' myth during negotiations with shareholders and, apparently, found common ground with the Europeans", while Boris Gryzlov, speaker of the State Duma observed that [...] "recent events show that someone {{does not want to}} allow us to enter their markets." [...] On 27 July 2006, the New York Times quoted the analysts as saying that many Western investors still think that anything to do with Russia is [...] "a little bit doubtful and dubious" [...] while others look at Russia in [...] "comic book terms, as mysterious and mafia-run." ...|$|E
2500|$|The main {{industrial}} {{district of}} the city was set during the 1940s in Contagem, a part of greater Belo Horizonte.

Among the companies headquartered in the city we can list steel producer Açominas (held by Gerdau, one of the largest multinationals originated in Brazil); Usiminas; Belgo-Mineira (held by Arcelor); Acesita (partially held by Arcelor); mobile communication Vivo; and Telecom Italia Mobile, Dasein executive search, executive coaching company, [...] as well as the NYSE-listed electrical company CEMIG.

50|$|A highly publicised {{attempt to}} merge Severstal with the French {{conglomerate}} <b>Arcelor</b> did not materialise and <b>Arcelor</b> instead merged with Mittal Steel on 25 June 2006 to create <b>Arcelor</b> Mittal.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, as a {{shareholder}} of both Mittal Steel Company and <b>Arcelor,</b> TCI supported Mittal Steel in the company's unsolicited takeover offer for <b>Arcelor.</b> However, when Mittal Steel subsequently attempted to acquire <b>Arcelor</b> Brasil (one of Arcelor's subsidiaries) without an appropriate premium, TCI defended {{the rights of}} <b>Arcelor</b> Brasil’s minority shareholders, causing Mittal to raise its offer price more than 55%.|$|E
50|$|On June 20, {{the above}} claim by economists was {{confirmed}} when Severstal increased its valuation of <b>Arcelor.</b> Management of <b>Arcelor</b> {{had in fact}} undervalued the company itself. The capability of management which had openly supported the previous valuation of <b>Arcelor</b> came into question. Further the combined markets of France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain chided <b>Arcelor</b> management and suspended trading of its stock.|$|E

5000|$|The {{company was}} the target of a {{takeover}} bid by its rival Mittal Steel on 27 January 2006. However, the bid resulted in substantial increase in Arcelor's share value. Two members of the board of <b>Arcelor,</b> Guillermo Ulacia and Jacques Chabanier also resigned suddenly. On 26 May 2006 <b>Arcelor</b> announced its intention to merge with Severstal. Since then several economists, media and shareholders have questioned the intentions of <b>Arcelor</b> in announcing its merger with Severstal due to a perceived opacity in the transaction. But on 25 June 2006, the <b>Arcelor</b> board decided {{to go ahead with the}} merger with Mittal Steel and scrapped plans for Severstal merger. The new company is now called [...] "ArcelorMittal". <b>Arcelor</b> also paid Severstal €140 million as a [...] "fine" [...] for the fall-out of their failed talks. Lakshmi Mittal (owner of Mittal Steel) became the president and Joseph Kinsch (formerly <b>Arcelor</b> chairman) was appointed chairman of the new company till his retirement. Arcelor's merger with Mittal created the worldwide leader in the steel industry, increasing its bargaining power with suppliers and consumers. Mittal Steel has agreed to pay 40.37 euros a share to <b>Arcelor,</b> almost double the amount offered by Mittal last time.|$|E
