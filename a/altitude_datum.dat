40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} Microsoft Robotics Studio (MSRS) in which a team of six four wheel drive, ground based robots explore and map simulated terrain. The user {{has the ability to}} modify the terrain and assign destination objectives to the team while the simulation is running. The terrain is initially generated using a gray scale image, in which the intensity of each pixel in the image gives an <b>altitude</b> <b>datum.</b> The robots start with no knowledge of their surroundings, and map the terrain as they attempt to reach user-defined target objectives. The mapping process simulates the use of common sensory hardware to determine datum points, including provision for field of view, detection range, and measurement accuracy. If traversal of a mapped area is indicated by the usersâ€™ targeting commands, path planning heuristics developed for MSRS by the author in earlier work are used to determine an efficient series of waypoints to reach the objective. Mutability of terrain is also explored- the user is able to modify the terrain without stopping the simulation. This forces the robots to adapt to changing environmental conditions, and permits analysis of the robustness of mapping algorithms used when faced with a changing world. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{surface of}} Mars, {{unshielded}} by thick atmosphere or global magnetic field, {{is exposed to}} high levels of cosmic radiation. This ionising radiation field is deleterious to the survival of dormant cells or spores and the persistence of molecular biomarkers in the subsurface, and so its characterisation is of prime astrobiological interest. Here, we present modelling results of the absorbed radiation dose as a function of depth through the Martian subsurface, suitable for calculation of biomarker persistence. A second major implementation of this dose accumulation rate data is in application of the optically stimulated luminescence technique for dating Martian sediments. We present calculations of the dose-depth profile in the Martian subsurface for various scenarios: variations of surface composition (dry regolith, ice, layered permafrost), solar minimum and maximum conditions, locations of different elevation (Olympus Mons, Hellas basin, <b>datum</b> <b>altitude),</b> and increasing atmospheric thickness over geological history. We also model the changing composition of the subsurface radiation field with depth compared between Martian locations with different shielding material, determine the relative dose contributions from primaries of different energies, and discuss particle deflection by the crustal magnetic fields...|$|R
