5|$|In {{the later}} {{half of his}} second term, Ravalomanana was criticized by {{domestic}} and international observers, who accused him of increasing <b>authoritarianism</b> and corruption.|$|E
5|$|During the Early Modern {{period of}} Swiss history, the growing <b>authoritarianism</b> of the patriciate {{families}} {{combined with a}} financial crisis {{in the wake of}} the Thirty Years' War led to the Swiss peasant war of 1653. In the background to this struggle, the conflict between Catholic and Protestant cantons persisted, erupting in further violence at the First War of Villmergen, in 1656, and the Toggenburg War (or Second War of Villmergen), in 1712.|$|E
5|$|Nasser {{remains an}} iconic {{figure in the}} Arab world, {{particularly}} for his strides towards social justice and Arab unity, modernization policies, and anti-imperialist efforts. His presidency also encouraged and coincided with an Egyptian cultural boom, and launched large industrial projects, including the Aswan Dam and Helwan City. Nasser's detractors criticize his <b>authoritarianism,</b> his human rights violations and his dominance of military over civil institutions, establishing a pattern of military and dictatorial rule in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} first {{published}} on September 1, 2009, by Scholastic, in hardcover, and was later released in ebook and audiobook format. Catching Fire received mostly positive reviews, with reviewers praising Collins' prose, the book's ending, {{and the development of}} Katniss's character. According to critics, major themes of the novel include survival, <b>authoritarianism,</b> rebellion and interdependence versus independence. The book has sold more than 19 million copies in the U.S. alone.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{reportedly}} saw {{the poll}} {{as an opportunity}} to legitimise him as a symbol of Vietnamese democracy, so that he could frame and justify his refusal to participate in national elections as a struggle between freedom and communist <b>authoritarianism.</b> Diệm asserted that South Vietnam would eventually reunify the nation under a democratic administration and liberate their northern compatriots from communist oppression, and championed the referendum as a first step in nurturing democracy. His support base was to use this as a means of justifying the deposal of Bảo Đại, citing past decisions that according to them, were pro-communist.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, {{both parties}} made similar {{proposals}} to reduce <b>authoritarianism</b> {{and the political}} influence of the military, and to maintain the Argentine claim in the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute. Alfonsín denounced a pact {{between the military and}} the Peronist unions that sought an amnesty for the military. He maintained that the armed forced should be subject to the civilian government, and that unions should be regulated. He also proposed an investigation into the actions of the military during the Dirty War. He closed his campaign by reading the preamble of the constitution of Argentina. The last rally was at the Plaza de la República, and was attended by 400,000 people.|$|E
5|$|The contested 2001 presidential {{elections}} in which then-mayor of Antananarivo, Marc Ravalomanana, eventually emerged victorious, caused a seven-month standoff in 2002 between supporters of Ravalomanana and Ratsiraka. The negative {{economic impact of}} the political crisis was gradually overcome by Ravalomanana's progressive economic and political policies, which encouraged investments in education and ecotourism, facilitated foreign direct investment, and cultivated trading partnerships both regionally and internationally. National GDP grew at an average rate of 7percent per year under his administration. In the later half of his second term, Ravalomanana was criticised by domestic and international observers who accused him of increasing <b>authoritarianism</b> and corruption.|$|E
5|$|Alongside Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Constantin Argetoianu (whom {{he succeeded}} as Premier), Tătărescu became a {{dominant}} {{figure in the}} group of maverick pro-Carol politicians. After a bloody crackdown on the Iron Guard, the Front attempted to reunite political forces in a national government that was to back Carol's foreign policies in view of increasing threats on Romania's borders after the outbreak of World War II. In 1945, Tătărescu stressed his belief that <b>authoritarianism</b> benefited Romania, and supported the view that Carol had meant to keep Romania out of the war. Tătărescu's second cabinet was meant to reflect the latter policies, but it did not draw any support from traditional parties, and, in April 1940, Carol, assisted by Ernest Urdăreanu and Mihail Ghelmegeanu, began talks with the (by then much weaker) Iron Guard.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{addressed}} the Parliament of Australia and was made an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George, {{one of the}} highest imperial honours that can be bestowed on a non-British subject—at the time, Australians were also British subjects. Diệm did not engage in substantive political discussions with the Australian leaders and {{he spent most of his}} time at public functions. He was universally extolled by the media, which praised him for what they perceived to be a successful, charismatic, democratic and righteous rule in South Vietnam, overlooking his <b>authoritarianism,</b> election fraud and other corrupt practices. The Australian Catholic leadership and media were particularly glowing towards the South Vietnamese head of state. A member of Vietnam's Catholic minority and the brother of Vietnam's leading archbishop, Diệm had pursued policies in Vietnam favoring his co-religionists. He exempted the Catholic Church from land redistribution, gave them more aid and job promotions, and allowed Catholic paramilitaries to attack Buddhists, who formed the religious majority.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the support}} that Zbor {{received}} in Serbia came {{from members of the}} urban middle class, as well as right-wing students and members of the armed forces. The majority of Zbor's members were ethnic Serbs, though some Croats and Slovenes also joined. Its membership fluctuated often, primarily due to disagreements over Ljotić's <b>authoritarianism</b> and his lack of popularity and political power in Serbia. Ljotić was an unpopular figure in Serbia due to his pro-German sympathies and religious fanaticism. The limited amount of support received by Zbor itself stemmed from the fact that radical right-wing sentiment was not strong amongst the Serbian population. The reason for this was that right-wing politics were associated with Germany. Being extremely anti-German, the majority of ethnic Serbs rejected fascist and Nazi ideas outright. Zbor never had more than 10,000 active members at any given time, with most of its support coming from Smederevo and from the ethnic German (Volksdeutsche) minority in Vojvodina that had been exposed to Nazi propaganda since 1933.|$|E
5|$|Opposition members criticized Ravalomanana in {{the later}} period of his presidency, accusing him of {{increasing}} <b>authoritarianism</b> and the mixing {{of public and private}} interests. In addition, the benefits of the country's growth were not evenly spread, leading to increased wealth inequality, inflation and a decline in purchasing power for the lower and middle classes. In 2008 a controversial land lease agreement with Korean agricultural firm Daewoo, the purchase of a costly presidential jet and the closure of media channels owned by opposition leader and mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, strengthened popular disapproval of his policies. Rajoelina rallied popular support for the opposition, leading to a popular uprising that began in January 2009 and ended two months later with Ravalomanana's resignation under pressure and Rajoelina taking control with military support in a power transfer viewed by the international community as a coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|The US Ambassador Elbridge Durbrow, who {{had been}} in the post since 1957, had a long record of trying to {{pressure}} Diệm into political reforms. He felt that South Vietnam's political problems were due to Diệm's illiberalism and thought the communist insurgency would be more easily defeated if Diệm reached out to a broader cross-section of society, cracked down on corruption, cronyism, abusive public servants, and implemented land reform. However, the South Vietnamese president saw <b>authoritarianism</b> as the solution to political problems and opposition, and the US military hierarchy in Vietnam agreed, leading to frequent disputes between Durbrow and the Military Assistance Advisory Group. Durbrow frequently reported to Washington that Diệm's strong-arm tactics against opposition only created more dissent and opportunities for the communists.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Caligari is not {{the only}} symbol of arrogant {{authority}} in the film. In fact, he is a victim of harsh authority himself during the scene with the dismissive town clerk, who brushes him off and ignores him to focus on his paperwork. Film historian Thomas Elsaesser argues that Dr. Caligari's murderous rampage through Cesare {{can be seen as a}} rebellious, anti-authoritarian streak in response to such experiences as these, even in spite of his own <b>authoritarianism.</b> The Expressionistic set design in this scene further amplifies the power of the official and the weakness of his supplicant; the clerk towers in an excessively high chair over the small and humiliated Dr. Caligari. The scene represents class and status differences, and conveys the psychological experience of being simultaneously outraged and powerless in the face of a petty bureaucracy. Another common visual motif is the use of stairways to illustrate the hierarchy of authority figures, such as the multiple stairs leading up to police headquarters, and three staircases ascending to Dr. Caligari in the asylum.|$|E
5|$|The {{visit to}} the US was the high point in Diệm's {{relations}} with his primary sponsor. The Americans began to place increasing pressure on Diệm to carry out democratic reforms and liberalize the political system, particularly during ambassadorship of Elbridge Durbrow. Diệm resisted the calls to broaden {{the base of his}} government and continued to rig elections. Meanwhile in the US, his support among the AFV also declined, in part due to his ongoing <b>authoritarianism,</b> and also because of his persistent complaints to them about negative media depictions of his regime; many Vietnamese leaders of various persuasions did not understand that western governments did not control their own media. Pressure also increased on Diệm at home, as the communists intensified their insurgency against him. In November 1960, discontent in his own army prompted a failed coup attempt by paratroopers. Although Diệm eventually organized for loyalists to put down the coup, he was angered by Durbrow's calls for him to try to negotiate a settlement, regarding the lack of support for his zero tolerance policy as a betrayal.|$|E
5|$|To be {{considered}} a dictator novel, a story should have strong political themes drawn from history, a critical examination of the power held by the dictator, the caudillo, and some general reflection {{on the nature of}} <b>authoritarianism.</b> Although some dictator novels centre on one historical dictator (albeit in fictional guise), they do not analyze the economics, politics, and rule of the régime as might a history book. The dictator novel genre includes I, the Supreme (1974), by Augusto Roa Bastos, about Dr. Francia of Paraguay, and The Feast of the Goat (2000), by Mario Vargas Llosa, about Rafael Leónidas Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. Alternatively, the novelist might create a fictional dictator to achieve the same narrative end, as in Reasons of State (1974), by Alejo Carpentier, in which the dictator is a composite man assembled from historical dictators. The genre of the dictator novel has been very influential {{in the development of a}} Latin American literary tradition, because many of the novelists rejected traditional, linear story-telling techniques, and developed narrative styles that blurred the distinctions between reader, narrator, plot, characters, and story. In examining the authority of leadership, the novelists also assessed their own social roles as paternalistic dispensers of wisdom, like that of the caudillo whose régime they challenged in their dictator novels.|$|E
25|$|Conscientiousness {{significantly}} correlates {{positively with}} right-wing <b>authoritarianism.</b> Although right-wing <b>authoritarianism</b> {{is one of}} the most powerful predictors of prejudice, a large scale meta-analysis found that conscientiousness itself is uncorrelated with general prejudice. Conscientiousness is positively correlated with support for capital punishment.|$|E

25|$|Isaiah Berlin listed Hegel {{as one of}} the six {{architects of}} modern <b>authoritarianism</b> who {{undermined}} liberal democracy, along with Rousseau, Claude Adrien Helvétius, Fichte, Saint-Simon, and Joseph de Maistre.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrest of}} Chee Soon Juan, and the {{lawsuits}} of slander against J. B. Jeyaretnam, both opposition MPs, {{have been cited}} by the opposition parties as examples of such <b>authoritarianism.</b> They also have been charged {{on the grounds of}} slander for political criticism. The lack of separation of powers between the court system and the government led to further accusations by the opposition parties of miscarriage of justice. Further arrests of those who were politically active against the PAP, such as Francis Seow, and even students who have recently entered tertiary education are part of these accusations of <b>authoritarianism.</b>|$|E

25|$|TCKs {{have the}} unique {{experience}} of being exposed to and living in cultures different from their home culture for extended periods of time. This {{has been found to}} affect their level of <b>authoritarianism,</b> both positively and negatively depending on the circumstance of the TCK. <b>Authoritarianism</b> measurements have been used by researchers on individuals, and high scores on the right-wing authoritarian scale (RWA) have been found to possess the following three personality characteristics: a tendency to submit themselves to authority figures, a willingness to commit an act of aggression for the sake of this authority or authorities, and possessing significant concern with acting according to the rules and norms of their group.|$|E
25|$|Anderson later {{abandoned}} authoritarian {{forms of}} socialism and became what would today {{be called a}} libertarian and pluralist—an opponent {{of all forms of}} <b>authoritarianism.</b> Sometimes he described himself as an anarchist but, after the 1930s, he gave up his earlier political utopianism.|$|E
25|$|Cobb {{disagreed}} with Castro openly over {{his turn to}} <b>authoritarianism</b> and Marxism, her anger becoming evident as the Communist influence on him became obvious. Cobb had hoped that a cessation in the US bombing of Cuban cane fields would prevent Castro's turn towards dictatorship.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} William H. Freehling {{noted that}} the South's argument for a state's right to secede was different from Thomas Jefferson's, in that Jefferson based such a right on the unalienable equal rights of man. The South's version of such a right was modified {{to be consistent with}} slavery, and with the South's blend of democracy and <b>authoritarianism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Due to the 2016–17 Turkish purges and Turkey's turn to <b>authoritarianism</b> {{some have}} speculated that Turkey could be {{expelled}} from NATO. United States President Donald Trump has also expressed interest in withdrawing from the organization during the 2016 election campaign, and only recently stated the United States would protect allies {{in the event that}} Article V is invoked.|$|E
25|$|The Thaksin {{government}} faced {{allegations of}} corruption, <b>authoritarianism,</b> treason, conflicts of interest, acting non-diplomatically, and muzzling of the press. Thaksin {{was accused of}} tax evasion, lèse majesté (insulting King Bhumibol), and selling assets of Thai companies to international investors. Independent bodies, including Amnesty International, criticised Thaksin's human rights record. Thaksin was also charged for concealing his wealth during his premiership.|$|E
25|$|Bureaucratic <b>authoritarianism</b> was {{practiced in}} Brazil after 1964, in Argentina, and in Chile under Augusto Pinochet, in a {{response}} to harsh economic conditions. It rested on the conviction that no democracy could take the harsh measures to curb inflation, reassure investors, and quicken economic growth quickly and effectively. Though inflation fell sharply, industrial production dropped with the decline of official protection.|$|E
25|$|In Moldavia the boyars, from whose lower ranks the revolutionaries {{would be}} drawn, {{had come into}} sharp {{conflict}} with Prince Mihail Sturdza, objecting to his <b>authoritarianism</b> and failure to consult them, with some desiring the throne for themselves. They denounced him to Saint Petersburg and Istanbul, forming plots in the general assembly, but as they were internally divided and lacked popular support, Sturdza remained unconcerned at these flare-ups.|$|E
25|$|At {{about this}} time, Robertson began exerting {{greater control over}} The Band, a point of {{contention}} between Helm and Robertson. Helm charges Robertson with <b>authoritarianism</b> and greed, while Robertson suggests his increased efforts in guiding the group were largely because Helm, Danko and Manuel were becoming more unreliable, due to their heroin usage. Robertson insists {{he did his best}} to coax Manuel into writing more songs, only to see Manuel descend into addiction.|$|E
25|$|Today, Africa {{contains}} 54 sovereign countries, most {{of which}} have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and <b>authoritarianism.</b> The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few {{of them have been}} able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of coups, producing military dictatorships.|$|E
25|$|Campaigning {{before the}} {{election}} focused mainly on a faltering economy, the political conflict {{between the government and}} the Gülen Movement, and Turkey's involvement in the Syrian Civil War. Growing allegations of government corruption and <b>authoritarianism,</b> mainly originating from the 2013 corruption scandal and the 2013 Gezi Park protests respectively, were also part of the issues and developments raised during the opposition campaigns. The vote was seen by some as a referendum on President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's call for an executive presidency.|$|E
25|$|Taut {{maintains}} his Scheerbartian views. He publishes ‘Die Auflösung der Städt' (The {{dissolution of}} the city) in line with Kropotkinian anarchist socialist tendencies. In common with the Soviets, it recommends the breakup of cities {{and a return to}} the land. He models agrarian communities and temples in the Alps. There would be 3 separate residential communities. 1. The enlightened. 2. Artists. 3. Children. This <b>authoritarianism</b> is noted in Frampton as although socialist in intent, paradoxically containing the seeds of the later fascism.|$|E
25|$|The former colonies faced severe {{problems}} after independence. Devastating {{and violent}} civil wars followed in Angola and Mozambique, which lasted several decades, claimed millions of lives, {{and resulted in}} large numbers of displaced refugees. Economic and social recession, <b>authoritarianism,</b> lack of democracy and other elemental civil and political rights, corruption, poverty, inequality, and failed central planning eroded the initial revolutionary zeal. A level of social order and economic development comparable to what had existed under Portuguese rule, including {{during the period of}} the Colonial War, became the goal of the independent territories.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 {{there were}} accusations of {{brainwashing}} of young people, and of elitism, conservatism, and <b>authoritarianism.</b> Later there were {{allegations of sexual}} abuse by the founder Luis Fernando Figari. There were also detailed allegations about the founder's extreme right-wing and phalangist activism in his youth. Following an investigation, on 30 January 2017, the Vatican's Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life ordered that Figari be “prohibited from contacting, in any way, persons belonging to the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, and no way have any direct personal contact with them.”.|$|E
