40|$|SummaryCultured {{adherent}} cells divide on the substratum, {{leading to}} {{formation of the}} cell monolayer. However, how the orientation of this <b>anchorage-dependent</b> <b>cell</b> division is regulated remains unknown. We have previously shown that integrin-dependent adhesion orients the spindle parallel to the substratum, which ensures this <b>anchorage-dependent</b> <b>cell</b> division. Here, we show that phosphatidylinositol- 3, 4, 5 -triphosphate (PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3) is essential for this spindle orientation control. In metaphase, PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 is accumulated in the midcortex in an integrin-dependent manner. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol- 3 -OH kinase (PI(3) K) reduces the accumulation of PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 and induces spindle misorientation. Introduction of PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 to these cells restores the midcortical accumulation of PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 and proper spindle orientation. PI(3) K inhibition causes dynein-dependent spindle rotations along the z-axis, resulting in spindle misorientation. Moreover, dynactin, a dynein-binding partner, is accumulated in the midcortex in a PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 -dependent manner. We propose that PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 directs dynein/dynactin-dependent pulling forces on spindles to the midcortex, and thereby orients the spindle parallel to the substratum...|$|E

The rate of EC-SOD synthesis varied by nearly 100 -fold among the fibroblast lines and remained essentially constant in the individual lines during long-term culture. In the nine investigated cases, the secreted EC-SOD was of the high-heparin-affinity C type.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{systematically}} investigate the factors considered to be responsible for <b>anchorage-dependent</b> <b>cell</b> behaviour to determine which, if any, of these factors exerts greater influence. An efficient means of doing so is the in vitro fibroblast cell culture model. The interaction of fibroblasts with novel substrata gives information about how a biological system reacts to a foreign material. The may ultimately lead to the development of improved biomaterials. This interdisciplinary study combines the elements of surface characterisation and biological testing to determine the nature of the biomaterial/host interface. Polarity and surface charge were found to have an important influence on fibroblast adhesion to hydrogel polymers, by virtue of their water-structuring effects. The same factors were found to affect cell adhesion on undegraded PHB-HV copolymers and their blends with polysaccharides. On degraded PHB-HV copolymers, the degradation process itself played the greatest role in influencing cell response. Increasing surface charge and mechanical instability in these polymers inhibited cell adhesion. Based on the observations of hydrogels and PHB-copolymers a novel material, gel-spun PHB was designed for use as a wound scaffold. In vitro tests using human and mammalian fibroblasts accentuated the importance of polarity and surface charge in determining cellular response. The overall view of cellular behaviour on a broad spectrum of materials highlighted the effects that polarity and surface charge have on water-structuring, and how this affects interfacial conversion.

40|$|We report {{here the}} design of a {{biomimetic}} nanofibrous hydrogel as a 3 D-scaffold for <b>anchorage-dependent</b> <b>cells.</b> The peptide-based bioactive hydrogel is formed through molecular self-assembly and the building blocks are a mixture of two aromatic short peptide derivatives: Fmoc-FF (Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-diphenylalanine) and Fmoc-RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate) as the simplest self-assembling moieties reported so far for the construction of small-molecule-based bioactive hydrogels. This hydrogel provides a highly hydrated, stiff and nanofibrous hydrogel network that uniquely presents bioactive ligands at the fibre surface; therefore it mimics certain essential features of the extracellular matrix. The RGD sequence as part of the Fmoc-RGD building block plays a dual role of a structural component and a biological ligand. Spectroscopic and imaging analysis using CD, FTIR, fluorescence, TEM and AFM confirmed that FF and RGD peptide sequences self-assemble into beta-sheets interlocked by pi-pi stacking of the Fmoc groups. Ibis generates the cylindrical nanofibres interwoven within the hydrogel with the presence of RGDs in tunable densities on the fibre surfaces.

30|$|First, {{graphene}} is an allotrope {{of carbon}} molecules {{that comes in}} shapes of two-dimensional, atomic-scale, honey-comb lattice. It has several novel properties, including excellent mechanical strength, and high thermal and electrical conductivity, making it an apropos candidate for electro-convulsive therapy. Consequently, graphene {{has been used in}} electrical, electrochemical, and optical applications [30, 31] as a newly applicable material for stem cell applications, such as osteogenesis. It is commonly obtained via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which is often used in high-quality and high-quantity production prior to transfer into various substrates [32]. Considering the fact that graphene is non-cytotoxic and allows mesenchymal stem cells to attach and proliferate [33, 34], it has become an increasingly promising substrate for <b>anchorage-dependent</b> <b>cells,</b> i.e., mesenchymal stem <b>cells</b> (MSCs) since <b>anchorage-dependent</b> <b>cells</b> must adhere to substrates in order to spread, proliferate, and function properly [20, 35].

In that sense, graphene can be functionalized to develop bioactivity of the composite, or {{to be used as a}} surface coating on biomaterial substrates. This arises from the surface chemistry of biomaterials which serve as a potential tool to control biological responses [38] while cell adhesion, viability, and proliferation determine the biocompatibility of the substrate [20, 32, 35 – 39].|$|R

The unsteady state reaction-diffusion equation (i. e., modified diffusion equation) is solved {{according to the}} von Kármán-Pohlhausen integral method of boundary layer analysis when nutrient consumption and tissue regeneration are stimulated by harmonically imposed stress. The mass balance with diffusion and stress-sensitive kinetics represents a rare example where the Damköhler and Deborah numbers appear together {{in an effort to}} simulate the development of mass transfer boundary layers in porous viscoelastic biomaterials.

40|$|Abstract Background The tumor {{suppressor}} gene PTEN has been found mutated in many types of advanced tumors. When introduced into tumor cells that lack the wild-type allele of the gene, exogenous PTEN was able to suppress their ability to grow anchorage-independently, and thus reverted one of the typical characteristics of tumor cells. As these findings indicated that PTEN might {{be involved in the}} regulation of <b>anchorage-dependent</b> <b>cell</b> growth, we analyzed this aspect of PTEN function in non-tumor cells with an anchorage-dependent phenotype. Results We found that in response to the disruption of cell-matrix interactions, expression of endogenous PTEN was transcriptionally activated, and elevated levels of PTEN protein and activity were present in the cells. These events correlated with decreased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, and occurred {{even in the absence of}} p 53, a tumor suppressor protein and recently established stimulator of PTEN transcription. Conclusions In view of PTEN's potent growth-inhibitory capacity, we conclude that its induction after cell-matrix disruptions contributes to the maintenance of the anchorage-dependent phenotype of normal cells. </p...|$|E

Suppression {{is unlikely to be}} due to loss or mutation of hamster genes conferring anchorage-independent growth as hybrids between 1042 AC and CHO-Ki have the suppressed phenotype of 1042 AC. Furthermore, a population of cells obtained from the hybrid by selecting for revertants to anchorage-independent growth showed selective loss of the transgenome derived from 1042 AC. The growth suppression was not due to transfection of the human Krev- 1 gene, which has previously been shown to restore anchorage-dependent growth, nor was there any evidence of alteration in the endogenous hamster Krev-l gene. However, evidence for a human gene being responsible for the suppressed phenotype has not been obtained yet. By comparison with the extensive knowledge of growth factors and their signal transducing pathways, the regulator...|$|R
40|$|Adhesion of normal, <b>anchorage-dependent</b> <b>cells</b> to a solid {{substratum}} {{leads to}} {{activation of the}} Na+/H+ antiporter and elevation of intracellular pH. These effects are mediated by extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin, and their receptors, the integrins. Experiments using pharmacological inhibition and down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) in C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells show that platelet-derived growth factor induces activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter {{by means of a}} PKC-dependent pathway in adherent cells but cannot do so in poorly adherent cells. Poorly adherent cells are, however, able to elevate intracellular pH in response to a phorbol ester, indicating that PKC and subsequent steps in the pathway are functional. These results indicate that coupling of platelet-derived growth factor to PKC activation requires cell adhesion...|$|R
