40|$|Abstract. Sensornet {{protocols}} periodically broadcast beacons {{for neighborhood}} information advertisement, but beacon transmissions are costly when power-saving radio duty cycling mechanisms are used. We show that piggybacking multiple beacons {{in a single}} transmission significantly reduces transmission costs and argue that this shows {{the need for a}} new layer in the sensornet stack—an <b>announcement</b> layer—that coordinates beacons across upper layer protocols. An <b>announcement</b> layer piggybacks beacons and coordinates their transmission so that the total number of transmissions is reduced. With an <b>announcement</b> layer, new or mobile nodes can quickly gather <b>announcement</b> information from all neighbors and all protocols by issuing an <b>announcement</b> pull operation. Likewise, protocols can quickly disseminate new <b>announcement</b> information to all neighbors by issuing an <b>announcement</b> push operation. We have implemented an <b>announcement</b> layer in the Contiki operating system and three data collection and dissemination protocols on top of the <b>announcement</b> layer. We show that beacon coordination both improves protocol performance and reduces power consumption. ...|$|R

Our results indicate that the post-earnings <b>announcement</b> equity security price return drift amplifies the equity security return reaction {{at the time of the}} earnings <b>announcement</b> for negative earnings changes. However, post-earnings <b>announcement</b> equity security price return drift reverses the equity security return reaction at the time of the earnings <b>announcement</b> for positive unexpected earnings. Implications of our research results for equity security return drift, reversal, and volatility are that equity security prices under-react at the time of the earnings <b>announcement</b> to negative unexpected earnings and over-react at the time of the earnings <b>announcement</b> to positive unexpected earnings. post earnings <b>announcement</b> drift; market efficiency; investors' expectations; trading volume; equity security returns; unexpected earnings. ...|$|R
