I admit that the arrangement of the house, which, however, is very simple, appears puzzling at first: the reason of this is, that the senses are often deceived, from mirrors here and there being so judiciously arranged, that they reflect at happy angles objects which would otherwise escape observation. It is impossible to convey an idea of the whole effect of the Pryor’s Bank, made up as it has been of carvings of unrivalled richness, grace, and variety, solemn and grotesque.

6000|$|The wisest {{conservatism}} {{is that of}} the Hindoos. [...] "Immemorial custom is transcendent law," [...] says Menu. That is, it was {{the custom}} of the gods before men used it. The fault of our New England custom is that it is memorial. What is morality but immemorial custom? Conscience is the chief of conservatives. [...] "Perform the settled functions," [...] says Kreeshna in the Bhagvat-Geeta; [...] "action is preferable to inaction. The journey of thy mortal frame may not succeed from inaction."--"A man's own calling with all its faults, ought not to be forsaken. Every undertaking is involved in its faults as the fire in its smoke."--"The man who is acquainted with the whole, should not drive those from their works who are slow of comprehension, and less experienced than himself."--"Wherefore, O Arjoon, resolve to fight," [...] is the advice of the God to the irresolute soldier who fears to slay his best friends. It is a sublime conservatism; as wide as the world, and as unwearied as time; preserving the universe with Asiatic anxiety, in that state in which it appeared to their minds. These philosophers dwell on the inevitability and unchangeableness of laws, on the power of temperament and constitution, the three goon or qualities, and the circumstances of birth and affinity. The end is an immense consolation; eternal absorption in Brahma. Their speculations never venture beyond their own table-lands, though they are high and vast as they. Buoyancy, freedom, flexibility, variety, possibility, which also are qualities of the Unnamed, they deal not with. The undeserved reward is to be earned by an everlasting moral drudgery; the incalculable promise of the morrow is, as it were, weighed. And who will say that their conservatism has not been effectual? [...] "Assuredly," [...] says a French translator, speaking of the antiquity and durability of the Chinese and Indian nations, and of the wisdom of their legislators, [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> vestiges of the eternal laws which govern the world." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{places that}} fashion has once loved and {{abandoned}} are very melancholy; {{but of all}} such places, I think the Battery is the most forlorn. <b>Are</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> sickly locust-trees there that cast a tremulous and decrepit shade upon the mangy grass-plots? I believe so, but I do not make sure; I am certain only of the mangy grass-plots, or rather the spaces between the paths, thinly overgrown {{with some kind of}} refuse and opprobrious weed, a stunted and pauper vegetation proper solely to the New York Battery. At that hour of the summer morning when our friends, with the aimlessness of strangers who are waiting to do something else, saw the ancient promenade, a few scant and hungry-eyed little boys and girls were wandering over this weedy growth, not playing, but moving listlessly to and fro, fantastic in the wild inaptness of their costumes. One of these little creatures wore, with an odd involuntary jauntiness, the cast-off best drew of some happier child, a gay little garment cut low in the neck and short in the sleeves, which gave her the grotesque effect of having been at a party the night before. Presently came two jaded women, a mother and a grandmother, that appeared, when they had crawled out of their beds, to have put on only so much clothing as the law compelled. They abandoned themselves upon the green stuff, whatever it was, and, with their lean hands clasped outside their knees, sat and stared, silent and hopeless, at the eastern sky, {{at the heart of the}} terrible furnace, into which in those days the world seemed cast to be burnt up, while the child which the younger woman had brought with her feebly wailed unheeded at her side. On one side of these women were the shameless houses out of which they might have crept, and which somehow suggested riotous maritime dissipation; on the other side were those houses in which had once dwelt rich and famous folk, but which were now dropping down the boarding-house scale through various un-homelike occupations to final dishonor and despair. Down nearer the water, and not far from the castle that was once a playhouse and is now the depot of emigration, stood certain express-wagons, and about these lounged a few hard-looking men. Beyond laughed and danced the fresh blue water of the bay, dotted with sails and smokestacks.|$|E

50|$|BCF has {{not found}} {{acceptance}} among professional paleontologists. It was only published twice, {{once in a}} magazine, Mesozoic Meanderings, which Olshevsky himself produced, and once in the popular-science magazine Omni. Paul perfunctorily dismissed the hypothesis in his Dinosaurs of the Air; in the peer-reviewed literature it is never even mentioned as such. However {{this does not mean}} the hypothesis has been completely ignored by professionals. Olshevsky is a well-known figure among dinosaur enthusiasts in the USA and has been for many years a very active participant in the various internet fora dedicated to the study of dinosaurs. This has led to much debate about BCF. The main objections from the professional side are that the scenario as a whole is too vague to be testable and that the empirical support for the most interesting subhypothesis — full flight capacity — is poor. Only for the group of the Tetanurae, which are already quite derived theropods, <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> slight indications, and these can be explained as exaptations. Because of the many convergences needed, BCF is also not very parsimonious when analysed from a cladistic point of view, as it implies that flight was lost many times. The parsimony problem would only be remedied if many flying forms would be found basal to the various groups. Current paleontological consensus is that dinosaurs started as, and largely remained, ground-dwelling forms, that most major branching points in Mesozoic dinosaurian phylogeny were not volant and that it were only the members of the derived dinosaurian clade Maniraptora that took to the trees — and to the air — during the Jurassic.|$|E

Meyer and Land call these key concepts, Threshold concepts, which they define as ‘core concepts that once understood, transform perception of a given subject’.

Meyer and Land also describe another problem, that of Troublesome knowledge. These are concepts that appear alien or counter-intuitive.

40|$|U NITARY {{concepts}} of the cause of obesity are abundant in the literature. The most popular one is that obesity {{is a matter of}} over-indulgence. The corollary is, of course, that dieting is the only cure. The most recent research and theorizing ’ suggests multiple etiologies and, thus, different types of obesity probably requiring different kinds of treatment. The major symptom-excessive fatty tis-sue- is grossly similar from one obese person to another and suggests a unitary disease. Of course, there are differences in the degree of excess fat, and differences in its distribution over the body frame as well. These may be variations in the symptom of the same disease or may represent etiologic differences. Further variations are strikingly apparent in the response of obese people to dieting. The range of results, in terms of weight loss over a given period of time, is as great as degrees of obesity in the obese population. The re-sistance of the symptom to treatment varies greatly. Considerations such as these have led to the evaluation of psychologic aspects in terms of two major questions. First, <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> common psychologic characteristics among the obese? Second, <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> psychologic differences among the obese which relate to differences in degree of symptom and differ-ences in ability to reduce?
