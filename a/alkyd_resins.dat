Therefore, we investigated the degradation of these resins in the soils. The results obtained were as follows. 1) The dergradation ratio of <b>alkyd</b> <b>resin</b> was higher than polyethylene resin. Three month later, the former was 4. 5 % and the latter was below 0. 5 %. The result that the degradation ratio of <b>alkyd</b> <b>resin</b> was higher in soil with a high humus content suggested that the degradation of the coating material is microbiological. 2) There were no differences between <b>alkyd</b> and polyethylene <b>resins</b> in the number of microorganisms on the coating membrane surface and in the soil around the coating membrane, but the number of fungi in the former was about 100 times higher in the coating membrane and was about 10 times higher in the soil around the coating membrane than in the latter. In addition, using the trial box for the measurement of enzymatic activity, soil enzymatic activity concerned with the degradation of <b>alkyd</b> <b>resin</b> membrane was measured, and the results showed that the activity of the soil enzymes was high nearer the membrane. 3) Under field conditions, we took the buried membrane out of soils and observed its surface by electron microscopy. It was observed that the surface of the <b>alkyd</b> <b>resin</b> membrane was consequently degraded than the surface of polyethylene resin. These results definitely show that the <b>alkyd</b> <b>resin</b> membrane was degraded faster than the polyethylene resin membrane by the microorganisms in soils, and it thus appears to be a good material for use in coated fertilizer...|$|R

The sedimentation of the solid particles in such suspensions occurs with the movement of an interface, and this is termed "hindered settling" when above the interface is tne clear supernatant liquid and below the interface is the suspended solid. The properties of the suspensions were judged in terms of the interface's behaviour as a function of time.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the main plastic used in day today life as packaging material, soft drink and mineral water bottles. Sri Lankan peoples alone consumes 6. 5 million PET bottles per month but only 1. 5 million bottles collected for recycling. This gives clear indication about the role of PET in environmental pollution. This report present development of effective chemical recycling process to depolymerize PET waste into its initial monomers and use of de-polymerized products to synthesized <b>alkyd</b> <b>resin</b> which can be use in coating industry. Depolymerization of PET was done by hydrolysis method to extract terephthalic acid(TPA). Here Na 2 CO 3 was successfully used as hydrolysis agent instead of highly corrosive NaOH. This overcome the common disadvantages of NaOH. At 170 °C, 35 minutes and 1 : 4 PET: EG (ethylene glycol) mole ratio 78. 89 % PET was reacted with Na 2 CO 3 without any catalyst.

The influence {{of the size of}} TiO 2 nanoparticles, their concentration and type of the surface modification on the rheological properties of <b>alkyd</b> <b>resin</b> was investigated. The obtained results have shown that the viscosity of the prepared dispersions was higher than viscosity of the pure resin, it increases with decreasing particle diameter and decreases with frequency increase. Surface modified particles showed higher influence on the viscosity of <b>alkyd</b> <b>resin</b> than unmodified, because their hydrodynamic volume is higher due to the presence of the adsorbed gallates, leading to the increase of effective volume fraction of particles in dispersion. For the lowest TiO 2 concentration, the viscosity was higher for sample modified with lauryl gallate, due to the higher thickness of the adsorbed layer. The increase of concentration, because of less dispersion stability of the particles modified with propyl gallate, leads to particles agglomeration. The presence of agglomerates, which was confirmed by a change in the slope of the functional dependence of storage modulus on loss modulus, leads to a rapid increase in viscosity.
