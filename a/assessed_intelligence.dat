The results confirmed the positive link between narcissism and self-assessed intelligence. Moreover, we demonstrated that this relationship was independent of actual abilities. In line with existing literature, we also found evidence that satisfying ego needs in this domain was a necessary precondition for narcissists’ well-being. Specifically, the results of Study 2 indicated that narcissists who evaluated their intelligence as low were not satisfied with their life.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{functional}} {{outcomes of}} 7 -year-old (school-age) children born small for gestational age (SGA; ie, a birth weight z score ≤ - 1 SD), with appropriate for gestational age (AGA) peers, born moderately preterm or full term. STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected {{as part of}} the Longitudinal Preterm Outcome Project study, a community-based, prospective cohort study of 336 AGA and 42 SGA born children (median gestational age 35 weeks, range 31 - 41). Of the SGA children, 32 were moderately preterm, 10 were full term; of the AGA, these numbers were 216 and 120, respectively. At 6. 9 years, we <b>assessed</b> <b>intelligence,</b> verbal memory, attention, visuomotor integration, and motor skills and we collected the parent-reported executive functioning. We compared the outcomes of the SGA children with those of their AGA peers. RESULTS: The performance of SGA children was similar to that of their AGA peers, except for attention control which was abnormal more often in SGA children (OR 3. 99, 95 % CI 1. 32 - 12. 12). The IQ of SGA children was 3 points lower, but this difference failed to reach significance. CONCLUSIONS: At school age, children born SGA have a greater risk of abnormal test scores on attention control than children born AGA, independent of gestational age. Their motor and many other cognitive functions are similar. The impact of these outcomes seems limited. Nevertheless, the consequences for school performance deserve attention...|$|E
40|$|The {{brain is}} a network and our {{intelligence}} depends {{in part on}} the efficiency of this network. The network of adolescents differs from that of adults suggesting developmental changes. However, whether the network changes over time at the individual level and, if so, how this relates to intelligence, is unresolved in adolescence. In addition, the influence of genetic factors in the developing network is not known. Therefore, in a longitudinal study of 162 healthy adolescent twins and their siblings (mean age at baseline 9. 9 [range 9. 0 - 15. 0] years), we mapped local and global structural network efficiency of cerebral fiber pathways (weighted with mean FA and streamline count) and <b>assessed</b> <b>intelligence</b> over a three-year interval. We find that the efficiency of the brain's structural network is highly heritable (locally up to 74 %). FA-based local and global efficiency increases during early adolescence. Streamline count based local efficiency both increases and decreases, and global efficiency reorganizes to a net decrease. Local FA-based efficiency was correlated to IQ. Moreover, increases in FA-based network efficiency (global and local) and decreases in streamline count based local efficiency are related to increases in intellectual functioning. Individual changes in intelligence and local FA-based efficiency appear to go hand in hand in frontal and temporal areas. More widespread local decreases in streamline count based efficiency (frontal cingulate and occipital) are correlated with increases in intelligence. We conclude that the teenage brain is a network in progress in which individual differences in maturation relate to level of intellectual functioning. Hum Brain Mapp 36 : 4938 - 4953, 2015...|$|E
50|$|Just as it {{was used}} when Binet first {{developed}} the IQ test, the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale: Fifth Edition (SB5) is based in the schooling process to <b>assess</b> <b>intelligence.</b> It continuously and efficiently assesses all levels of ability in individuals with a broader range in age. It is also capable of measuring multiple dimensions of abilities (Ruf, 2003).|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{different}} methods are generally used to <b>assess</b> <b>intelligence</b> and personality. Intelligence is normally measured {{by means of}} ability tests, whereas personality is usually assessed by means of questionnaires. Furthermore, different typical measurements lead to another conceptual distinction, which is that intelligence is considered to indicate individuals’ maximal performance, while personality is believed to reflect their typical behaviour. However, others argue that multiple methods {{can be used to}} <b>assess</b> <b>intelligence</b> and personality; for example, questionnaires that require to be rated by self, peers or observers {{can also be used to}} measure individuals’ mental ability, although these kinds of measurement may lack accuracy. Therefore, different typical methods cannot prove that the relationship between intelligence and personality is a meaningless one. In addition, since individuals’ ability can also affect their typical behaviour, IQ can predict outcomes related to aspects such as performance at work, academic achievement, and health. Therefore, ability tests can provide indices of both maximal performance and typical behaviour.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Reporting neurodevelopmental {{outcome of}} 8 -year-old {{children}} treated with neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). METHODS: In a follow-up study in 135 8 -year-old children who received neonatal ECMO between 1996 and 2001 we <b>assessed</b> <b>intelligence</b> (Revised Amsterdam Intelligence Test), concentration (Bourdon-Vos test), eye-hand coordination (Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration) and behavior (Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher Report Form). RESULTS: Intelligence fell within normal range (mean IQ 99. 9, SD 17. 7, n = 125) with 91 % {{of the children}} following regular education. Significantly more children attended special education (9 %) or received extra support in regular education (39 %) compared with normative data. Slower working speed (chi(2) = 132. 36, p < 0. 001) and less accuracy (chi(2) = 12. 90, p < 0. 001) {{were found on the}} Bourdon-Vos test (n = 123) compared with normative data. Eye-hand coordination fell within the normal range (mean 97. 6, SD 14. 3, n = 126); children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia scored lowest but still normally (mean 91. 0, SD 16. 4, n = 28). Mothers (n = 117) indicated more somatic and attention behavior problems; teachers (n = 115) indicated more somatic, social, thought, aggression and total problems compared with normative data. Mothers indicated more somatic problems than teachers (p = 0. 003); teachers reported more attention problems than mothers (p = 0. 036; n = 111). CONCLUSIONS: Eight-year-old children treated with neonatal ECMO fall in the normal range of intelligence with problems with concentration and behavior. Long-term follow-up for children treated with neonatal ECMO should focus on early detection of (subtle) learning deficits...|$|E
40|$|Background: Specific {{knowledge}} about the functional outcome of preterm born children with post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD) is lacking. Objectives: To determine functional outcome at school age in children with post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation and to identify whether PHVD characteristics increased the risk for deficits. Methods: Single-center case-control study. Included were preterm children born between 1996 and 2003 who had PHVD in their neonatal period. The controls were children matched for gestation, gender, and year of birth. At school age, using standardized tests and questionnaires, we <b>assessed</b> <b>intelligence,</b> attention, verbal memory, executive functioning, visual perception, visuomotor integration, motor skills, and behavior. Results: Of 34 children with PHVD 28 survived, three of whom could not be tested at school age (one child's parents declined and two were lost to follow-up). At {{a mean age of}} 10 years (6 - 14 years) the total and verbal IQs of the remaining 25 children (17 boys, 8 girls) were significantly lower compared to controls (difference in total IQ- 14 points, verbal IQ- 9 points, P = 0. 001 and P = 0. 009, respectively). After adjustment for possible confounders, the performance of the PHVD group was poorer on visual perception and attention tests. Selective attention showed a trend toward risk of borderline and abnormal scores (OR 4. 03, 95 %-CI 0. 84 - 19. 2). Within the PHVD group, total IQ was significantly lower (P = 0. 048) in those who had undergone surgical intervention (n = 12). Conclusion: At school age, intelligence, attention, and visual perception were more affected in the PHVD group than in the matched controls. Surgical intervention was associated with lower IQ scores.

To assess the influence of parental age on intelligence during childhood and adolescence, we investigated twins between 6 and 16 years old in the Southwestern China Prospective Twin Registry. We <b>assessed</b> <b>intelligence</b> using the Chinese edition of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) on 178 monozygotic and 155 dizygotic twin pairs. Advanced maternal age was not associated with increased total IQ in male and female offspring, explaining less than 1 % of the variance. The heritability of total IQ was 17 % (95 % CI: 0 – 39 %), with shared environment explaining 57 % (95 % CI: 36 – 73 %) of the variance. Similarly, for performance IQ, the influence of parental age was not significant, with heritability accounting for 12 % (95 % CI: 0 – 38 %) of the variance and shared environment 51 % (95 % CI: 28 – 67 %). Paternal age was associated with higher verbal IQ, explaining approximately 2 % of variance. Finally, the variance of verbal IQ was greater in females than in males, with genetic and shared environmental influences equal across the sexes.

40|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that reading speed (RS) or fluency should be a component of reading comprehension (RC) models. There is also evidence of a relationship between RS and RC.

In addition, while there are studies published with English speakers and learners, less evidence exists in more transparent orthographies, such as Portuguese. This study investigated the relationship between RC and RS in typical readers. Objectives included elucidating the following: (1) the contribution of RS to RC controlling for intelligence, word recognition, and listening and (2) the differential relationships and contributions of RS to comprehension in different school grades. The sample of participants comprised 212 students (M = 8. 76; SD = 1. 06) from 2 nd to 4 th grade. We <b>assessed</b> <b>intelligence,</b> word recognition, word RS, listening, and RC. Performance in all tests increased as a function of grade. There were significant connections between RC and all other measures. Nonetheless, the regression analysis revealed that word RS has a unique contribution to RC after controlling for intelligence, word recognition, and listening, with a very modest but significant improvement in the explanatory power of the model. We found a significant relationship between RS and RC only for 4 th grade and such relationship becomes marginal after controlling for word recognition. The findings suggest that RS could contribute to RC in Portuguese beyond the variance shared with listening and, mainly, word recognition, but such a contribution was very small. The data also reveal a differential relationship between RS and RC in different school grades; specifically, only for the 4 th grade does RS begins to relate to RC.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{longitudinal}} development {{of intelligence and}} its relation to school performance in a nationwide cohort of neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) survivors and evaluate predictors of outcome at 8 years of age. METHODS: Repeated measurements <b>assessed</b> <b>intelligence</b> of neonatal ECMO survivors at 2, 5, and 8 years (n = 178) with the use of validated, standardized instruments. Selective attention (n = 148) and type of education were evaluated in the 8 -year-olds. RESULTS: Intelligence remained stable and average across development (mean +/- SD IQ: at 2 years, 102 +/- 18; at 5 years, 100 +/- 17; and at 8 years, 99 +/- 17 [P =. 15]). Children attending regular education without the need for help (n = 101; mean z score: - 1. 50 +/- 1. 93) performed significantly better on the selective attention task compared with those children who needed extra help (n = 65; mean z score: - 2. 54 +/- 3. 18) or those attending special education (n = 13; mean z score: - 4. 14 +/- 3. 63) (P =. 03). However, only children attending special education had below-average intelligence (mean IQ: 76 +/- 15), compared with average intelligence for those attending regular education, both with help (mean IQ: 95 +/- 15) and without help (mean IQ: 105 +/- 16). Compared with children with other diagnoses, children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) scored significantly lower on both IQ (CDH, mean IQ: 93 +/- 20; meconium aspiration syndrome, mean IQ: 100 +/- 15; other diagnoses, mean IQ: 100 +/- 19 [P =. 04]) and selective attention (CDH, mean z score: - 3. 48 +/- 3. 46; meconium aspiration syndrome, mean z score: - 1. 60 +/- 2. 13; other diagnoses, mean z score: - 1. 65 +/- 2. 39 [P =. 002]).
