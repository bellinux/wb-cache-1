It’s possible to create art from joy, he said, but it’s art created from adversity that is most often the art worth paying attention to: [...] "You can have that impulse to create whether you’ve been through a tragedy or not, obviously. But to me, it's like, if you don't struggle to create your art in some way, why do I care <b>about</b> it? ... To <b>me,</b> it’s like, 'Tell me something. Tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> your struggle.

40|$|ABSTRACT. One of {{the latest}} {{developments}} in the ideas about molecular evolutionary process is that evolution is a natural system engineering process. The natural genetic engineering has the potential to create hierarchical subsystems and complex networks of genome regulation (Shapiro, 2005). According to most researchers in this field, mobile elements (MEs) are perhaps the most important tool of this natural engineering. They are universal agents of evolutionary change. During evolution, they have created and modified the genome architecture (in global and local scale), the gene structure and regulation, and they do so in genomes of recent organisms. MEs also became the main driving force for cells to develop major epigenetic defense mechanisms. Later in evolution, these defense mechanisms have been utilized as basic cellular regulatory systems. In this article, we review and synthesize the latest ideas <b>about</b> <b>MEs</b> and cellular regulatory systems and propose a hypothesis <b>about</b> <b>MEs</b> as key units, interconnecting global and local scales of genome regulation...|$|R
