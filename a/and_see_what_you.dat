500|$|The {{story begins}} as a boy named Marco walks home from school, {{thinking}} of his father's advice: [...] "Marco, keep your eyelids up/ <b>And</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can see." [...] However, the only thing Marco has seen on his walk is a horse pulling a wagon on Mulberry Street. To make his story more interesting, Marco imagines progressively more elaborate scenes based around the horse and wagon. He imagines the horse is first a zebra, then a reindeer, then an elephant, and finally an elephant helped by two giraffes. The wagon changes to a chariot, then a sled, then a cart holding a brass band.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Disney {{began to}} {{negotiate}} with Joseph Kosinski to direct Tron: Legacy. Kosinski admitted that at the time, he was not keen on the idea but it later grew on him as time progressed. Kosinski {{was involved in a}} meeting with Bailey, president of Walt Disney Pictures. [...] "Disney owns the property, Tron," [...] Bailey stated. [...] "Do you know it? Are you interested? What would your take be? In a post-Matrix world, how do {{you go back to the}} world of Tron?" [...] Kosinski wanted to embrace the general ambiance of the film, and wished to not use the internet as a model or use a formula emulative of The Matrix film series. As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money in order to create a conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need to show you what this world looks and feels like. Give me some money and let me do a small test that will give you a hint for a couple minutes of it, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Greig {{was born}} to a Scottish {{immigrant}} father and a South African-born mother, and was educated at Queen's College, Queenstown, South Africa. Many former Sussex players had been recruited to coach the cricket team at Queen's College—during Greig's schooldays, Jack Oakes, Alan Oakman, Ian Thomson, Ron Bell, Richard Langridge and Mike Buss all came from overseas for off-season work. All of them noticed Greig's developing abilities which, after a first-class debut for Border Province in the Currie Cup, led to a trial at Sussex when Greig was 19. Greig's father helped him decide between university study or pursuit of the Sussex offer. [...] "He used to slam into me for not reading enough, for being generally immature. He {{would look at me}} sometimes and say 'Boy, when I was your age I was fighting a war', but in the end he grinned and said: 'Go over to England for one year, one year mind, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can do'".|$|E

2500|$|Ellen Burstyn {{was still}} in the midst of filming The Exorcist when Warner Bros. {{executives}} expressed interest in working with her on another project. Burstyn later recalled, [...] "It was early in the woman's movement, and we were all just waking up and having a look at the pattern of our lives and wanting it to be different… I wanted to make a different kind of film. A film from a woman's point of view, but a woman that I recognized, that I knew. And not just myself, but my friends, what we were all going through at the time. So my agent found Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore… When I read it I liked it a lot. I sent it to Warner Brothers and they agreed to do it. Then they asked who I wanted to direct it. I said that I didn't know, but I wanted somebody new and young and exciting. I called Francis Coppola and asked who was young and exciting and he said 'Go look at a movie called Mean Streets <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think.' It hadn't been released yet, so I booked a screening to look at it and I felt that it was exactly what…Alice needed, because [...] was a wonderful script and well written, but for my taste it was a little slick. You know – in a good way, in a kind of Doris Day–Rock Hudson kind of way. I wanted something a bit more gritty." ...|$|E
2500|$|McCreight {{prevented}} a {{confrontation between the}} 7th Cavalry Regiment and aggrieved Ojibwe from Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation. In 1885, a band of 100–150 of Chief Little Shell’s Ojibwe warriors left the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation and came to Devils Lake on a Sunday morning before day break while the town was sleeping. The Ojibwe were in a serious dispute with the U.S. government and were angry because white settlers were breaking treaties, stealing Indian timber and killing Indian game. They came to Devils Lake to protest, determined to right a grievance and threatening the settlers. [...] McCreight was the “Indian Man” in Devils Lake, and his roommate doctor woke him before sunrise saying: [...] "Get up quick, the Indians are out there; they are holding a war-dance; they mean devilment and will burn the town; hurry, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can do with them!" [...] McCreight was sympathetic to Ojibwe grievances and understood their anger and frustration. He immediately went to the Ojibwe camp, parleyed with Little Shell and eventually persuaded the natives to return to Turtle Mountain. McCreight reported, “ It was all over before the town folks stirred about after their late Sunday morning breakfast; and over their own late breakfast, the doctor and the writer decided it best to say nothing, to avoid publicity, for it might interfere with business, and perhaps bring the wrath of General George Armstrong Custer's troops at the fort, against the suffering natives, and so the incident was closed and soon forgotten — forgotten except for the life-long humiliation at failure of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to intercede for and {{protect the rights of}} these abused natives.” ...|$|E
