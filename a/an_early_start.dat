5|$|Concerts and boxing matches {{eventually}} {{took their}} toll on the pitch. In 2008, late post-concert pitch renovation, combined with <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>start</b> to the football season, led to the pitch not being ready for the first home fixture, causing the club to play its UEFA Cup first round qualifying match at Barnsley's Oakwell Stadium and a moratorium to be imposed on the staging of non-football events at Eastlands. In May 2010, the club invested in a new pitch and summer concerts resumed in 2011 when Take That played eight nights, with ticket sales totalling approximately 400,000.|$|E
5|$|Despite Lee's {{hope for}} <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>start,</b> {{it took all}} morning to arrange the {{infantry}} assault force. Neither Lee's nor Longstreet's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet, describing it either as a misunderstanding of Lee's verbal order or a mistake. Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet's Gettysburg performance by the postbellum Lost Cause authors cite this failure as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee's plan for the battle.|$|E

40|$|Global {{temperature}} is increasing, {{and this is}} affecting the vegetation phenology {{in many parts of}} the world. In Fennoscandia, as well as Northern Europe, the advances of phenological events in spring have been recorded in recent decades. In this study, we analyzed the start of the growing season within five different vegetation regions in Fennoscandia using the 30 -year Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI 3 g dataset. We applied a previously developed pixel-specific Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) threshold method, adjusted it to the NDVI 3 g data and analyzed trends within the different regions. Results show a warming trend with <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>start</b> of the growing season of 11. 8 ± 2. 0 days (p < 0. 01) for the whole area. However, there are large regional differences, and the warming/trend towards <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>start</b> of the growing season is most significant in the southern regions (19. 3 ± 4. 7 days, p < 0. 01 in the southern oceanic region), while the start was stable or modest earlier (two to four days; not significant) in the northern regions. To look for temporal variations in the trends, we divided the 30 -year period into three separate decadal time periods. Results show significantly more change/trend towards <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>start</b> of the growing season in the first period compared to the two last. In the second and third period, the trend towards <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>start</b> of the growing season slowed down, and in two of the regions, the trend towards <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>start</b> of the growing season was even reversed during the last decade. phenology; start of the growing season; NDVI time series; NDVI 3 g; Fennoscandia; vegetation regions; temporal trend...|$|R

5|$|The flight muscles {{need to be}} kept at a {{suitable}} temperature for the dragonfly {{to be able to}} fly. Being cold-blooded, they can raise their temperature by basking in the sun.

Another method of warming up used by some larger dragonflies is wing-whirring, a rapid vibration of the wings that causes heat to be generated in the flight muscles. The green darner (Anax junius) is known for its long-distance migrations, and often resorts to wing-whirring before dawn to enable it to make <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>start.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Catherine's ukase of 1788, just as other nations were {{entering}} the maritime fur trade, the Russians had spent over 40 years establishing and expanding their maritime operations in North America. A number of colonies were being established over a large region stretching from the Aleutian Islands to Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. Many ships sailed from Kamchatka to Alaska each year. The Russians not only had <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>start,</b> but they also controlled the habitats {{of the most valuable}} sea otters. The Kurilian, Kamchatkan, and Aleutian sea otters' fur was thicker, glossier, and blacker than those on the Northwest Coast and California. The four grades of fur were based on color, texture, and thickness. The most prized furs were those of Kurilian and Kamchatkan sea otters, Aleutian furs were second grade, those of the Northwest Coast third, and the poorest grade was those of Californian sea otters. Russia also controlled the sources of sable furs, the most valuable fur-bearing land mammal.|$|E

Following the Phoenicians, the Carthaginians introduced new advances to the region-including the teachings of the early viticulturist Mago. Carthage would wage a series of wars with the emerging Roman Republic that would lead to the Roman conquest of the Spanish mainland, known as Hispania.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} stage, Utzon worked {{successfully}} {{with the rest}} of the design team and the client, but, as the project progressed, the Cahill government insisted on progressive revisions.

This resulted in a continuing series of delays and setbacks while various technical engineering issues were being refined. The building was unique, and the problems with the design issues and cost increases were exacerbated by commencement of work before the completion of the final plans.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{elucidate}} the impact of <b>earlier</b> school <b>start</b> times on elementary school children. Research demonstrates that adolescents are chronically sleep deprived due to shifting biological rhythms and <b>early</b> school <b>start</b> times. <b>As</b> a result, some schools have restructured their schedules to allow for later start times for {{middle and high school}} students. This change has inadvertently resulted in <b>earlier</b> <b>start</b> times for the elementary school students. Although studies demonstrate a positive impact of later start times for adolescents, no studies have examined younger children. This project, therefore, examined the effect of <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>start</b> time on the sleep patterns of elementary school students, as well as assessed correlations between sleep and cognitive functioning. Two groups of second graders (an experimental and control group) were followed for one-year; one experienced <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> school <b>start</b> time in third grade, and the other did not. Measures of actigraphy and survey data were obtained. Results demonstrated that changing to <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> school <b>start</b> time may cause school-aged children to obtain less quality of sleep, and experience a higher rate of daytime sleepiness. Because of the limited sample size included in this study, results are dependent on a larger scale experiment which will be completed within the next year...|$|R

Famous publishing houses like those of Christoffel Plantijn in Antwerp from 1555 on, Pierre Phalèse the Elder in Leuven from 1553, and the House of Elzevir in Leiden from around 1580 turned the Low Countries into a regional center of publishing.|$|E

Graded at AD+ to D-, dependent upon conditions, the route has an average angle of around 52° and the summit takes around 4 hours or more to reach from the Torino Hut. The route's difficulties are being mainly in overcoming the initial bergschrund and the moving from the lower to the upper ice field. By keeping to the right hand side of the slope climbers are able to utilise rock belays {{for much of the}} climb.
