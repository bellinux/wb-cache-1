5|$|His law {{practice}} had many influential clients, including Lord Braco and {{the sons of}} Lord Fraser of Lovat. Pitfour was one of 15 advocates <b>acting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> case raised by Alexander Fraser against Lord Fraser claiming the liferents to the Lovat estates. Eventually a compromise was reached; Lovat retained the liferents and Fraser gained a monetary sum instead. As the negotiations had taken many hours of legal deliberation over a three-year period, the case proved very profitable for Pitfour.|$|E
5|$|Rædwald's pagan queen admonished him for <b>acting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> manner dishonourable for a king by betraying {{his trust}} {{for the sake}} of money and wanting to sell his imperiled friend in {{exchange}} for riches. As a result of her admonishment, once Æthelfrith's ambassadors had gone, Rædwald resolved on war.|$|E

5|$|The {{thought of}} <b>acting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> film {{had never even}} entered their minds. They're easy-going people, {{they have a good}} time {{in front of the camera}} and I don't think there was a single moment where either of them felt they were working. Paz, however, was {{definitely}} conscious of the fact that she was interpreting a role.|$|E
5|$|Cooper Anderson (Matt Bomer), Blaine's (Darren Criss) {{older brother}} and an actor in {{television}} ads, visits McKinley High and is treated as a celebrity by Blaine's boyfriend Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Sue. Blaine is unhappy, though, when after he and Cooper do an impromptu mashup of two Duran Duran songs in the choir room, Cooper finds fault with Blaine's singing. Sue recruits Cooper to give an acting master class for the club, which contains such bad advice that Blaine is appalled. Worse, Cooper subsequently criticizes Blaine's <b>acting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> class scene.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{had been}} invited to stay at Tranby Croft, Yorkshire, the home of Arthur Wilson and his family. Among Edward's party were his advisers, Lord Coventry and Lieutenant-General Owen Williams; Gordon-Cumming, a friend of the prince, was also invited. On the first night the guests played baccarat, and Stanley Wilson thought he saw Gordon-Cumming {{illegally}} adding to his stake. Stanley informed other members of the Wilson family, and they agreed to watch him on the following evening. Gordon-Cumming was again seen to be <b>acting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> suspicious manner. The family members asked the advice of the royal courtiers who, with the agreement of the prince, confronted Gordon-Cumming and pressured him into signing a document that declared he would never play cards again, in exchange for the silence of the guests.|$|E

5|$|Rachel Larris, who {{has also}} {{conducted}} an academic study of The Daily Show, disputes the findings of Baumgartner and Morris. Larris argues that the study measured cynicism in overly broad terms, {{and that it would}} be extremely hard to find a causal link between viewing The Daily Show and thinking or <b>acting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> particular way. Bloggers such as Marty Kaplan of The Huffington Post argue that so long as Stewart's comedy is grounded in truth, responsibility for increased cynicism belongs to the political and media figures themselves, not the comedian who satirizes them.|$|E
5|$|Though they aren't very {{enthusiastic}} {{at the idea}} of <b>acting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> film about the independence movement, Sue eventually manages to convince them. Laxman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni), a right-wing political party activist, joins the cast later, despite initially being unpopular due to his anti-Western ideology, due to which he is often at odds with the other four, and anti-Muslim beliefs and contempt for Aslam Khan. In the process of filming, the idealism of India's revolutionary heroes seeps into the protagonists. They gradually begin to realize that their own lives are quite similar to the characters they portray in Sue's film and that the state of affairs that once plagued the revolutionaries continues to torment their generation.|$|E
5|$|Now infected, Wesley uses {{a digital}} sample of Captain Picard's voice to lure key {{engineering}} crew-members {{away from the}} engineering deck. He erects a force field around the area with his tractor beam device and assumes control of the ship. He allows one of the engineers, Mr. Shimoda (Benjamin W.S. Lum), who is <b>acting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> childlike manner, into the force field. Mr. Shimoda manages to remove all of the isolinear chips from the engine control station and plays with them like toys. As the supergiant star collapses, a fragment is blown into a direct impact course with the two Federation ships, and without the chips in place, they cannot move out of its way. Chief Engineer Sarah MacDougal (Brooke Bundy) manages to disable Wesley's force field, and Data is sent to replace the chips. He reports {{that he will not}} have enough time. Wesley reverses the ship's tractor beam, repelling the Enterprise off the Tsiolkovsky, giving themselves the necessary additional seconds for Data to replace the chips enabling the ship {{to move out of the}} way. The crew is cured of the ailment, and Picard partially credits Wesley for helping to prevent a disaster.|$|E

40|$|The present studies {{tested a}} {{proposed}} model that outlines {{the consequences of}} unconsciously activated behavior on affect and cognition. The model proposes that <b>acting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> explanatory vacuum (i. e. when no explanation can be given for one’s own behavior due to unconscious activation), gives rise to negative affect, which in turn triggers people to confabulate (i. e. making up other plausible, but erroneous, reasons for one’s behavior). Moreover, the model predicts that, for negative affect and confabulation to arise spontaneously, behavior has to be norm-violating. Study 1 was designed to test whether <b>acting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> explanatory vacuum can lead to negative affect and confabulation, when asked to explain one’s behavior. Study 2 was designed to test the entire theoretical model by determining whether, as <b>a</b> result of <b>acting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> explanatory vacuum, confabulation can arise spontaneously and whether this is mediated by negative affect and/or moderated by norms. The results showed that confabulation can arise <b>in</b> both <b>a</b> provoked and spontaneous manner and {{that the effect of}} <b>acting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> explanatory vacuum on confabulation is mediated by negative affect. Confabulation only occurs spontaneously following norm-violating behavior...|$|R

40|$|This work {{proves that}} the {{proteolytic}} action of leucocytes {{is not a simple}} cleavage by one ferment. There are present two proteases, one <b>acting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> alkaline medium and the other <b>in</b> <b>an</b> acid medium. This confirms Opie's work. In the leucocytes there was found <b>in</b> addition <b>an</b> ereptic ferment which is capable of <b>acting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> acid or alkaline medium. Since this action is lost by heating to 70 °C., and by drying and keeping the leucocytes, it probably represents a ferment which acts on the digestion products of the two proteases. Analogy with other ferments in the body confirms this opinion...|$|R
