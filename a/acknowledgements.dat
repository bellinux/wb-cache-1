He later {{became a member of the}} Hui Kālaiʻāina (Hawaiian Political Association), a political group founded in 1888 to oppose the Bayonet Constitution and promote Native Hawaiian leadership in the government. After the adoption of the constitution, White gave a speech in Hilo speaking out against it. He criticized the exclusion of the Chinese and Japanese from the vote, especially focusing on the latter group because of Hawaii's treaty with the Empire of Japan. By 1890, he had returned to his native island of Maui.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{advancement}} in 2049 {{is not based}} on merit or politics alone, rather executives can issue challenges to each other which are held on highways emptied of cars and usually fought to the death, in a fashion similar to Mad Max, a source cited as inspiration by the author in the <b>acknowledgements</b> of the book. Chris Faulkner gains recognition and small celebrity for a particularly brutal win over a much older and more seasoned member of his firm, from which he is head-hunted by Shorn to join their team. Within the media landscape, business executives have fame on the order of sports stars or movie actors and their driving duels are analysed and covered as sporting events. Chris' wife Carla is also his mechanic, a vital role where an executive's car is the difference between promotion and death. She is not a fan of the way he makes his living, but they have an initially strong relationship.|$|E

40|$|The {{films of}} Catherine Breillat are {{interpreted}} here {{through the lens}} of <b>acknowledgement,</b> especially insofar as that term is understood by the American philosopher Stanley Cavell. Breillat's films are primarily ones which portray the coming-together (and breaking-apart) of romantic couples. The journeys charted by these couples are ones whose destinations aim for states of mutual <b>acknowledgement.</b> These journeys do not, however, result in happy endings. They do, on the contrary, tend to chart the failure or impossibility of <b>acknowledgement.</b> Ultimately, the failure of <b>acknowledgement</b> is a failure on the part of men to recognize or understand the value of <b>acknowledgement,</b> but the insistent demand for <b>acknowledgement</b> expressed by the female protagonists of Breillat's films points to the centrality of the concept of <b>acknowledgement</b> in her cinematic oeuvre...|$|R
50|$|Duplicate <b>acknowledgement</b> is {{the basis}} for the fast retransmit {{mechanism}} which works as follows: after receiving a packet (e.g. with sequence number 1), the receiver sends an <b>acknowledgement</b> by adding 1 to the sequence number (i.e., <b>acknowledgement</b> number 2) which means that the receiver received the packet number 1 and it expects packet number 2 from the sender. Let's assume that three subsequent packets have been lost. In the meantime the receiver receives packet numbers 5 and 6. After receiving packet number 5, the receiver sends an <b>acknowledgement,</b> but still only for sequence number 2. When the receiver receives packet number 6, it sends yet another <b>acknowledgement</b> value of 2. Because the sender receives more than one <b>acknowledgement</b> with the same sequence number (2 in this example) this is called duplicate <b>acknowledgement.</b>|$|R
5|$|My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy {{opens with}} a {{dedication}} to Daws Butler, a list of <b>acknowledgements</b> and a foreword from Cartwright's The Simpsons co-star Dan Castellaneta. The first chapter of the book details Cartwright's life and career prior to 1987. In the second chapter, Cartwright recalls the day she went to audition for a role {{in a series of}} animated shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show. The shorts were about a dysfunctional family and Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa Simpson, the eldest daughter. Upon arriving at the audition, she found the role of her brother Bart to be much more interesting. Matt Groening, creator of the shorts, allowed her to audition for Bart, and gave her the job on the spot after hearing her reading. From there, the book contains her experiences as the voice of Bart. After three seasons of shorts, a half-hour spinoff called The Simpsons debuted in 1989. In the following chapters, she recalls the early days of The Simpsons, commenting on the recording process and her co-stars and revealing how she got the roles of some of the other characters she voices, including Nelson Muntz and Ralph Wiggum. In the 15th chapter, she discusses her experiences of voicing a famous character, but rarely being recognized.|$|E
5|$|The book {{consists}} of twelve chapters, plus an Epilogue and an <b>Acknowledgements</b> section at the end. Smith and MacKinnon individually write alternating chapters, {{each of which}} covers one month from March 2005 to February 2006. In the first chapter MacKinnon tells how his idea for the 100-mile diet began and Smith agrees to try it for one year. They begin symbolically {{on the first day}} of Spring, March 21, and define 'local' as 100 miles, a convenient radius that would include the Lower Mainland, the southern half of Vancouver Island, and Whatcom County and Skagit County in Washington State. Their exceptions to this rule include meals eaten while traveling, meals prepared by friends, and business lunches. Their initial month was expensive as they scoured grocery stores for whatever they could find. In the second chapter, Smith describes her and MacKinnon as an unwed urban couple in their early thirties with no children and living in a rented apartment. They recount how eating impacted their relationship before and after the diet, the anonymity of prepackaged foods, the traceability of their diet, and the diets of the Coast Salish.|$|E

40|$|The {{expansion}} of Internet into wireless network {{has been a}} very active area of research. One of the topics many researches focus on is the performance of TCP over wireless environment. TCP is an Internet transport protocol, which uses a cumulative <b>acknowledgement</b> strategy to adjust its transmission rate. In this paper we investigate the impact of two <b>acknowledgement</b> strategies employed by receivers known as basic <b>acknowledgement</b> and delayed acknowledgment on TCP performance. Thus, a simple analysis of implementing delayed <b>acknowledgement</b> in standard TCP will be presented. Further, we examine the impact of both <b>acknowledgement</b> strategies on the performance of our proposed E-TCP (Enhanced-TCP). We show that delayed <b>acknowledgement</b> mechanism has negative impact on E-TCP performance in wireless networks...|$|R

30|$|In [9], {{the authors}} {{introduce}} a per-hop hybrid implicit/explicit <b>acknowledgement</b> scheme for stop and wait ARQ in a multi-hop acoustic channel. In this scheme, when a relay node receives a packet, it sends an <b>acknowledgement</b> message only when its previous data transmission has been already acknowledged. The <b>acknowledgement</b> can be implicit {{with the data}} packet itself or explicit with an <b>acknowledgement</b> message. Unfortunately, both mechanisms have a high time-out. They demonstrate that their protocol has a better latency and energy efficiency than the traditional schemes. However, the latency remains high and when the explicit <b>acknowledgement</b> is used, it increases the energy expenditure.|$|R

25|$|After Lazarus {{had checked}} her gun {{and come to}} the {{interrogation}} room, they explained that this was really about some loose ends they were trying to tie up in the Rasmussen case, since her name had come up in the investigation. They claimed they wanted a private setting because while Ruetten was an old boyfriend, she was long married to someone else and did not want her private life to become the subject of office gossip. Stearns and Jaramillo knew they would have to tread carefully since Lazarus herself was well aware of police interview techniques and her rights to silence and legal counsel, which she could invoke at any time. They rambled and digressed from the subject at times, sometimes discussing unrelated police business, but eventually came back to Rasmussen. Lazarus claimed to recall little due to the intervening years, but gradually revealed more and more knowledge—including oblique <b>acknowledgements</b> of her visits to the Ruetten condo—until she accused her colleagues of considering her a suspect, whereupon they allowed that there was DNA evidence connecting her to the crime scene and she was free to go. She left the room and was immediately arrested and charged with the murder.|$|E

It would receive reports from the Attorney General, Inspector General, Comptroller General, the military criminal justice system, victims' organizations, human rights organizations as well as any relevant legal investigations and judgments. Having determined whether the cases received fall under the JEP's jurisdiction, it would group the reports by alleged/convicted perpetrator and similar conducts and present reports on practices or events, identifying all responsible and their shares of responsibility. On the basis of these reports, those individuals identified would acknowledge or deny their responsibility, individually or collectively. The Chamber would present a resolution of conclusions to the Peace Tribunal, with emphasis on the most serious and representative crimes, individualization of responsibilities, <b>acknowledgements</b> of responsibility and the identification of the appropriate sanctions. In cases without acknowledgement of responsibility, the Chamber would transmit the cases to the Investigation and Prosecution Unit for it to begin proceedings as appropriate. The Chamber would have considerable autonomy to manage its own affairs, set its rules, form working commissions, establish priorities, adopt criteria for selection and decongestion or define the sequence in which cases would be addressed.|$|E
