It's 27 years later. And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." [...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E

[...] Heinz's son André said at the services: [...] "Dad, I am so grateful for the time we had, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> you and I love you." ...|$|E

That month, they spoke with CNN and the Arab satellite station Al-Arabiya in Amman. When asked about her father, Raghad told CNN, [...] "He {{was a very good}} father, loving, has a big heart." [...] Asked if she wanted to give a message to her father, she said: [...] "I love you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> you."

2500|$|The word [...] "slash" [...] is also {{developing}} {{as a way}} {{to introduce}} topic shifts or follow-up statements. [...] "Slash" [...] can introduce a follow up statement, such as, [...] "I really love that hot dog place on Liberty Street. Slash can we go there tomorrow?" [...] It can also indicate a shift to an unrelated topic, as in [...] "JUST SAW ALEX! Slash I just chubbed on oatmeal raisin cookies at north quad <b>and</b> <b>i</b> <b>miss</b> you." [...] The new usage of [...] "slash" [...] appears most frequently in spoken conversation, though it can also appear in writing.|$|E

I've been living a pretty low-key {{domestic}} existence <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> things. Like, I miss performing, and dancing, and being on the road, that kind of energy. So part of the record is about that. And then the other part is about love. So there's the frivolous side {{of my life and}} then there's the –hopefully– non-frivolous side of my life. I usually make a record that's one or the other, and I feel I did both on this one".|$|E
2500|$|Holden's first {{starring}} role was in Golden Boy (1939), costarring Barbara Stanwyck, {{in which he}} played a violinist-turned-boxer. He was still an unknown actor at the time, while Stanwyck was already a film star. She liked Holden and went {{out of her way}} to help him succeed, devoting her personal time to coaching and encouraging him, which made them into lifelong friends. When she received her Honorary Oscar at the 1982 Academy Award ceremony, Holden had died in an accident just a few months prior. At the end of her acceptance speech, she paid him a personal tribute: [...] "I loved him very much, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so tonight, my golden boy, you got your wish".|$|E

2500|$|The {{evolution}} of Kelly's character led to developments both on-screen and off. In a 1995 article on Garth, TV Guide {{reported that the}} show's creators {{made a conscious decision}} to place her character at center stage. An anonymous producer cites [...] "faith in Jennie as an actress," [...] further stating that he and producer Aaron Spelling [...] "knew she had the chops to do it." [...] This development would gradually lead to Kelly supplanting Brenda as the prominent female lead, as the former received what the producer called [...] "better story lines." [...] Reportedly, these matters became a source of tension between Garth and Shannen Doherty, who played Brenda. Following Doherty's final appearance on the show in 1994, however, Garth stated, [...] "We were friends at work, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> her most of the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|William Holden and Stanwyck {{were friends}} of long standing. [...] When Stanwyck and Holden were {{presenting}} the Best Sound Oscar for 1977, Holden paused {{to pay a}} special tribute to her for saving his career when Holden was cast in the lead for Golden Boy (1939). After a series of unsteady daily performances, {{he was about to}} be fired, but Stanwyck staunchly defended him, successfully standing up to the film producers. Shortly after Holden's death, Stanwyck recalled the moment when receiving her honorary Oscar: [...] "A few years ago I stood on this stage with William Holden as a presenter. I loved him very much, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so tonight, my golden boy, you got your wish." ...|$|E

50|$|When I {{left for}} college, I was more {{interested}} in the hard sciences—physics <b>and</b> especially geophysics. <b>I</b> was fascinated by the movement of Earth tectonics and geology. The idea of these large forces that shape our Earth is still a really fascinating sidebar interest. In fact, I’d almost say it is a focus; I’m often as interested in that as I am in architecture. Ultimately, I came to understand pretty early that I did not have a natural propensity for the larger geophysics requirements <b>and</b> <b>I</b> really <b>missed</b> what architecture is: the intersection between the rational <b>and</b> the poetic. <b>I</b> was just in the rational world of physics <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> the poetic.
