5|$|Blood film {{examination}} {{may reveal}} basophilic stippling of {{red blood cells}} (dots in red blood cells visible through <b>a</b> <b>microscope),</b> {{as well as the}} changes normally associated with iron-deficiency anemia (microcytosis and hypochromasia). However, basophilic stippling is also seen in unrelated conditions, such as megaloblastic anemia caused by vitamin B12 (colbalamin) and folate deficiencies.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{students}} of certain biological sciences, paramedics, prosthetists and orthotists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, podiatrists, and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers. The study of microscopic anatomy (or histology) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under <b>a</b> <b>microscope.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A primary {{difference}} between <b>a</b> stereo <b>microscope</b> and <b>a</b> digital <b>microscope</b> is the magnification. With <b>a</b> stereo <b>microscope</b> the magnification is found by multiplying the lens magnification by the eyepiece magnification. Since the digital microscope {{does not have}} an eyepiece, the magnification cannot be found using this method. Instead the magnification for <b>a</b> digital <b>microscope</b> is found by how many times larger the sample is reproduced on the monitor. Therefore, the magnification will depend {{on the size of the}} monitor. The average digital microscope system, which has a 15" [...] monitor, would result in an average difference in magnification between <b>an</b> optical <b>microscope</b> and <b>a</b> digital <b>microscope</b> of about 40%. Thus the magnification number of <b>a</b> stereo <b>microscope</b> is usually 40% less than the magnification number of <b>a</b> digital <b>microscope.</b>|$|R

5|$|Lung cancers are {{classified}} according to histological type. This classification {{is important for}} determining management and predicting outcomes of the disease. Lung cancers are carcinomas—malignancies that arise from epithelial cells. Lung carcinomas are categorized by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under <b>a</b> <b>microscope.</b> For therapeutic purposes, two broad classes are distinguished: non-small-cell lung carcinoma and small-cell lung carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Viewed with <b>a</b> <b>microscope,</b> {{the wall}} of the {{apothecium}} is made of three tissue layers of roughly equal thickness. The first layer of tissue is black, leathery and compact, and covered with a fine layer of brownish-black hairs (a tomentum); the second layer consists of loosely interlaced brown hyphae suspended in a gelatinous matrix. The third layer is the fertile, spore-bearing surface, the brownish-black hymenium.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> {{fluorescence}} <b>microscope</b> is <b>an</b> optical <b>microscope</b> {{that uses}} fluorescence and phosphorescence instead of, or in addition to, reflection and absorption to study properties of organic or inorganic substances. The [...] "fluorescence microscope" [...] refers to any microscope that uses fluorescence to generate an image, {{whether it is}} a more simple set up like <b>an</b> epifluorescence <b>microscope,</b> or <b>a</b> more complicated design such as <b>a</b> confocal <b>microscope,</b> which uses optical sectioning to get better resolution of the fluorescent image.|$|R

5|$|A year later, Mechnikov {{studied a}} fresh water {{crustacean}} called Daphnia, a tiny transparent animal {{that can be}} examined directly under <b>a</b> <b>microscope.</b> He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal were destroyed by phagocytes. He went on to extend his observations to the white blood cells of mammals and discovered that the bacterium Bacillus anthracis could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called phagocytosis. Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.|$|E
5|$|Collected in deposit, {{the spores}} of B. mirabilis are olive-brown. Viewed with <b>a</b> <b>microscope,</b> the spores are {{spindle-shaped}} to roughly elliptical, with smooth, thick walls, and have dimensions of 18–22 by 7–9µm. Overholts' 1940 publication on the species reported spore dimensions of 20–26 by 8–9µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), 4-spored, and have dimensions of 31–36 by 7–11µm. Cystidia (sterile cells {{on the face}} of a gill) are thin-walled, and measure 60–90 by 10–18µm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Collybia cookei is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the two other members of Collybia, both of which are outwardly similar in appearance; distinguishing between the three typically requires excavating the stem base away from the moss or debris in which the stem is embedded. In the field, C.tuberosa may be distinguished from C.cookei by its dark brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed. Using <b>a</b> <b>microscope</b> provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the sclerotia of C.cookei are rounded, while those of C.tuberosa are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species. C.cirrhata does not produce sclerotia.|$|E
50|$|The {{electron}} microscope {{is used to}} obtain structural information at the nano-scale. Unlike <b>an</b> optical <b>microscope,</b> <b>an</b> electron <b>microscope</b> is able to surpass the diffraction limit of light.

5|$|Comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) must {{be present}} to {{diagnose}} acne. In their absence, an appearance {{similar to that}} of acne would suggest a different skin disorder. Microcomedones (the precursor to blackheads and whiteheads) are not {{visible to the naked eye}} when inspecting the skin and can only be seen with <b>a</b> <b>microscope.</b> There are many features that may indicate a person's acne vulgaris is sensitive to hormonal influences. Historical and physical clues that may suggest hormone-sensitive acne include onset between ages 20 and 30; worsening the week before a woman's menstrual cycle; acne lesions predominantly over the jawline and chin; and inflammatory/nodular acne lesions.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{measurements}} do {{not provide}} an actual picture like imaging with <b>a</b> <b>microscope</b> can. Lipid bilayers cannot {{be seen in a}} traditional microscope because they are too thin. In order to see bilayers, researchers often use fluorescence microscopy. A sample is excited with one wavelength of light and observed in a different wavelength, so that only fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen. Natural lipid bilayers are not fluorescent, so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer. Resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers, much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a lipid bilayer.|$|E

Fossils include shark teeth, coprolites, or fossilized dung, petrified wood, dinosaur eggs, trilobites, {{and a baby}} dinosaur of the Psittacosaurus genus. One display features all 12 birthstones with {{a version}} of each in its natural state and as finished gemstones, along with the same before and after for other gemstones such as aquamarine.

5|$|In 1937 the Norwegian {{pathologist}} Leiv Kreyberg {{was allowed}} to examine one of Reich's bion preparations under <b>a</b> <b>microscope.</b> Kreyberg wrote that the broth Reich had used as his culture medium was indeed sterile, but that the bacteria were ordinary staphylococci. He concluded that Reich's control measures to prevent infection from airborne bacteria were not as foolproof as Reich believed. Kreyberg accused Reich of being ignorant of basic bacteriological and anatomical facts, while Reich accused Kreyberg of having failed to recognize living cancer cells under magnification.|$|E
5|$|In Petrified Forest National Park, most of {{the logs}} in the park {{retained}} their original external form during petrification but lost their internal structure. However, {{a small fraction of}} the logs and {{most of the}} park’s petrified animal bones have cells and other spaces that are mineral-filled but still retain much of their original organic structure. With these permineralized fossils, it is possible to study the cellular make-up of the original organisms with the aid of <b>a</b> <b>microscope.</b> Other organic matter—typically leaves, seeds, cones, pollen grains, spores, small stems, and fish, insect, and animal remains—have been preserved in the park as compression fossils, flattened by the weight of the sediments above until only a thin film remains in the rock.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the spore shape, the species is readily identified {{with the use of}} <b>a</b> <b>microscope</b> because of its setae. Setae are a kind of unusual cystidia unique to the family Hymenochaetaceae, and, in P.ellipsoideus, are found in the hymenium. In shape, the setae are ventricose, with distinctive hooks on their tips. In colour, they are yellow-brown, and they have thick cell walls. They measure 20 to 30 by 10 to 14μm. Neither more standard cystidia nor cystidioles (underdeveloped cystidia) {{can be found in the}} species, but there are a number of rhomboid crystals throughout the hymenium and the flesh.|$|E

5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} (LCs) are {{matter in}} a state which has properties between those of conventional liquids and those of solid crystals. For instance, a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be oriented in a crystal-like way. There are {{many different types of}} liquid-crystal phases, which can be distinguished by their different optical properties (such as birefringence). When viewed under <b>a</b> <b>microscope</b> using a polarized light source, different liquid crystal phases will appear to have distinct textures. The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are oriented in different directions. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in a liquid-crystal phase (just as water may turn into ice or steam).|$|E
5|$|Potentially precancerous {{changes in}} the cervix can be {{detected}} by cervical screening, using methods including a Pap smear (also called a cervical smear), in which epithelial cells are scraped {{from the surface of}} the cervix and examined under <b>a</b> <b>microscope.</b> The colposcope, an instrument used to see a magnified view of the cervix, was invented in 1925. The Pap smear was developed by Georgios Papanikolaou in 1928. A LEEP procedure using a heated loop of platinum to excise a patch of cervical tissue was developed by Aurel Babes in 1927. In some parts of the developed world including the UK, the Pap test has been superseded with liquid-based cytology.|$|E
5|$|Prominent {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cholangiocarcinoma include abnormal liver function tests, abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss. Other symptoms such as generalized itching, fever, and changes in color of stool or urine may also occur. The disease is diagnosed through a combination of blood tests, imaging, endoscopy, and sometimes surgical exploration, with confirmation obtained after a pathologist examines cells from the tumor under <b>a</b> <b>microscope.</b> Known risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include primary sclerosing cholangitis (an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts), infection with the parasitic liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini or Clonorchis sinensis, some congenital liver malformations, and exposure to Thorotrast (thorium dioxide), a chemical formerly used in medical imaging. However, most people with cholangiocarcinoma have no identifiable risk factors.|$|E
