5|$|Platinum is an {{extremely}} rare metal, occurring at a concentration of only 0.005 ppm in Earth's crust. It is sometimes mistaken for silver. Platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum and as alloy with the other platinum-group metals and iron mostly. Most often the native platinum is found in secondary deposits in alluvial deposits. The alluvial deposits used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia are still a source for platinum-group metals. Another large <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> is in the Ural Mountains, Russia, {{and it is still}} mined.|$|E
5|$|Within Earth's crust, osmium, like iridium, {{is found}} at highest {{concentrations}} in {{three types of}} geologic structure: igneous deposits (crustal intrusions from below), impact craters, and deposits reworked {{from one of the}} former structures. The largest known primary reserves are in the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa, though the large copper–nickel deposits near Norilsk in Russia, and the Sudbury Basin in Canada are also significant sources of osmium. Smaller reserves {{can be found in the}} United States. The alluvial deposits used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia are still a source for platinum group metals. The second large <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> was found in the Ural Mountains, Russia, which is still mined.|$|E
25|$|The Pekin Formation is a Late Triassic deposit in Deep River Basin of North and South Carolina, {{which dates}} from the Carnian about 231 million years ago. The {{formation}} is the oldest in the Chatham Group. The locality of Carnufex is in a boulder field, and the rock facies suggest that the region once represented a channel or <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposit.</b> In the Carnian, the formation would have been 2º north of the paleoequator. Many fauna from the Pekin Formation await formal description. The fauna include a new aetosaur, Carnufex and another crocodylomorph, an unnamed traversodont formerly assigned to Boreogomphodon, and a new dicynodont.|$|E

40|$|Twenty-two shallow, reversed, seismic {{refraction}} profiles {{were conducted}} in the Brazos River floodplain to test the feasibility of using seismic methods to provide hydrogeologic information in this province. The specific objectives were to map the total and saturated thickness of the <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> and to outline gravel lenses within the alluvium. It {{was found that the}} water table was the only interface at which the acoustical properties of the deposits above and below changed sufficiently to be mapped by seismic methods. The <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> above the water transmitted compressional waves at an average velocity just greater than the velocity of sound in air. The saturated <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> transmitted seismic waves at an average velocity of slightly greater than the velocity of sound in water. The saturated <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> and the bedrock appear to have a continuous increase in velocity with depth rather than a significant change in acoustical characteristics. The seismic measurements in themselves could not delineate gravel lenses within the alluvium. However, the zones of greater permeability were indicated on the resulting contour map of the water table by the areas of gentle gradients. Zones of greater permeability in the <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> are probably gravel lenses...|$|R

60|$|In {{searching the}} beds of partly dried-up watercourses, the fact must never be forgotten, {{that it is}} {{especially}} in little tributaries {{at the point where}} they fall into the main one, that most water is to be found; and the most insignificant of these should never be overlooked. I presume that the bar, which always accumulates in front of tributaries, and is formed of numerous layers of <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposit,</b> parallel to the bed of the great stream, is very likely to have one, at least, of its layers of an impervious character. If so, the bar would shut in the wet sand of the tributary, like a wall, and prevent it from draining itself dry.|$|E

60|$|In {{the last}} resort, then, it is mainly on mud {{that the life}} of {{humanity}} in all countries bases itself. Every great plain is the <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> of a great river, ultimately derived from a great mountain chain. The substance consists {{as a rule of}} the débris of torrents, which is often infertile, owing to its stoniness and its purely mineral character; but wherever it has lain long enough to be covered by earth-worms with a deep black layer of vegetable mould, there the resulting soil shows the surprising fruitfulness one gets (for example) in Lombardy, where twelve crops a year are sometimes taken from the meadows. Everywhere and always the amount and depth of the mud is the measure of possible fertility; and even where, as in the Great American Desert, want of water converts alluvial plains into arid stretches of sand-waste, the wilderness can be made to blossom like the rose in a very few years by artificial irrigation. The diversion of the Arkansas River has spread plenty over a vast sage scrub; the finest crops in the world are now raised over a tract of country which was once the terror of the traveller across the wild west of America.|$|E
60|$|First soil, then {{plant and}} animal life, are thus in the last resort wholly {{dependent}} for their existence {{on the amount of}} rainfall. But in deserts, where rain seldom or never falls (except by accident) the first term in this series is altogether wanting. There can be no rivers, brooks or streams to wash down beds of <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> from the mountains to the valleys. Denudation (the term, though rather awful, is not an improper one) must therefore take a different turn. Practically speaking, there is no water action; the work is all done by sun and wind. Under these circumstances, the rocks crumble away very slowly by mere exposure into small fragments, which the wind knocks off and blows about the surface, forming sand or dust of them in all convenient hollows. The frequent currents, produced by the heated air that lies upon the basking layer of sand, continually keep the surface agitated, and so blow about the sand and grind one piece against the other till it becomes ever finer and finer. Thus {{for the most part the}} hollows or valleys of deserts are filled by plains of bare sand, while their higher portions consist rather of barren, rocky mountains or table-land.|$|E
60|$|The {{evidence}} that the Jordan-Arabah valley really was once filled with water, the surface of which reached within 160 feet {{of the level of}} the pass of Jezrael, and possibly stood higher, is this: Remains of alluvial strata, containing shells of the freshwater mollusks which still inhabit the valley, worn down into terraces by waves which long rippled at the same level, and furrowed by the channels excavated by modern rainfalls, have been found at the former height; and they are repeated, at intervals, lower down, until the Ghor, or plain of the Jordan, itself an <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposit,</b> is reached. These strata attain a considerable thickness; and they indicate that the epoch at which the freshwater mere of Palestine reached its highest level is extremely remote; that its diminution has taken place very slowly, and with periods of rest, during which the first formed deposits were cut down into terraces. This conclusion is strikingly borne out by other facts. A volcanic region stretches from Galilee to Gilead and the Hauran, {{on each side of the}} northern end of the valley. Some of the streams of basaltic lava which have been thrown out from its craters and clefts in times of which history has no record, have run athwart the course of the Jordan itself, or of that of some of its tributary streams. The lava streams, therefore, must be of later date than the depressions they fill. And yet, where they have thus temporarily dammed the Jordan and the Jermuk, these streams have had time to cut through the hard basalts and lay bare the beds, over which, before the lava streams invaded them, they flowed.|$|E

6000|$|The great English novelists of {{the eighteenth}} century turned the course of English Literature out of its older channel. Her streams had descended from the double peaks of Parnassus to irrigate the {{enamelled}} fields and elegant parterres of poetry and the drama, as the critics of the period might have said. But Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, and Sterne, diverted the waters, from poetry and plays, into the region of the novel, whither they have brought down a copious <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposit.</b> Modern authors do little but till this fertile Delta: the drama is now in the desert, poetry is a drug, and fiction is literature. Among the writers who made this revolution, Smollett is, personally, the least well known to the world, despite the great part which autobiography and confessions play in his work. He is always talking about himself, and introducing his own experiences. But there is little evidence from without; his extant correspondence is scanty; he was not in Dr. Johnson's circle, much less was he in that of Horace Walpole. He was not a popular man, and probably he has long ceased to be a popular author. About 1780 the vendors of children's books issued abridgments of [...] "Tom Jones" [...] and [...] "Pamela," [...] "Clarissa" [...] and [...] "Joseph Andrews," [...] adapted to the needs of infant minds. It was a curious enterprise, certainly, but the booksellers do not seem to have produced [...] "Every Boy's Roderick Random," [...] or [...] "Peregrine Pickle for the Young." [...] Smollett, in short, is less known than Fielding and Sterne, even Thackeray says but a word about him, in the [...] "English Humorists," [...] and he has no place in the series of [...] "English Men of Letters." ...|$|E
60|$|But I am {{far from}} {{depending}} on this {{authority for the}} age of the Mesopotamian plain. On the contrary, I venture to rely, with much more confidence, on another kind of evidence, which tends to show that {{the age of the}} great rivers must be carried back to a date earlier than that at which our ingenuous youth is instructed that the earth came into existence. For, the <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> having been brought down by the rivers, they must needs be older than the plain it forms, as navvies must needs antecede the embankment painfully built up by the contents of their wheel-barrows. For thousands of years, heat and cold, rain, snow, and frost, the scrubbing of glaciers, and the scouring of torrents laden with sand and gravel, have been wearing down the rocks of the upper basins of the rivers, over an area of many thousand square miles; and these materials, ground to fine powder {{in the course of their}} long journey, have slowly subsided, as the water which carried them spread out and lost its velocity in the sea. It is because this process is still going on that the shore of the delta constantly encroaches on the head of the gulf [5] into which the two rivers are constantly throwing the waste of Armenia and of Kurdistan. Hence, as might be expected, fluviatile and marine shells are common in the alluvial deposit; and Loftus found strata, containing subfossil marine shells of species now living, in the Persian Gulf, at Warka, two hundred miles in a straight line from the shore of the delta. [6] It follows that, if a trustworthy estimate of the average rate of growth of the alluvial can be formed, the lowest limit (by no means the highest limit) of age of the rivers can be determined. All such estimates are beset with sources of error of very various kinds; and the best of them can only be regarded as approximations to the truth. But I think it will be quite safe to assume a maximum rate of growth of four miles in a century for the lower half of the alluvial plain.|$|E
