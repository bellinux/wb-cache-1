40|$|I study workers' {{incentives}} {{to invest in}} general human capital (education) {{in the presence of}} search-induced unemployment. Workers queue for jobs, and firms prefer to hire the most productive applicants because of rent sharing. As <b>a</b> result, <b>an</b> <b>unemployed</b> <b>worker's</b> ranking relative to other job seekers will influence his job-finding rate. This creates a "rat race," where workers invest in education partly in order to achieve a better ranking. In equilibrium, identical workers may have {{incentives to}} diversify in terms of education, and the investments in education may exceed the socially optimal level.

50|$|George J. Stigler {{proposed}} {{thinking of}} searching for bargains or jobs as an economically important problem. John J. McCall proposed a dynamic model of job search, based on the mathematical method of optimal stopping, on which much later work has been based. McCall's paper studied the problem of which job offers <b>an</b> <b>unemployed</b> <b>worker</b> should accept, and which reject, when the distribution of alternatives is known and constant, {{and the value of}} money is constant. Holding fixed job characteristics, he characterized the job search decision in terms of the reservation wage, that is, the lowest wage the worker is willing to accept. The worker's optimal strategy is simply to reject any wage offer lower than the reservation wage, and accept any wage offer higher than the reservation wage.|$|E

40|$|We study {{unemployment}} insurance benefit recipients’ transitions out of unemployment, focusing {{on whether they}} are recalled to the previous employer. For this purpose, we develop a split population model of the recall decision by employers, since only <b>a</b> portion of <b>unemployed</b> <b>workers</b> is ever recalled.

30|$|If people hired {{under the}} {{programme}} were already employed, does a positive coefficient for the programme imply {{an increase in}} employment? The answer is affirmative. All other things being equal, workers who terminate their previous jobs (whether through quitting or being fired), are probably replaced by new workers, and so the situation for the firms that lose their workers remains the same. Sooner or later the system fills the vacancy caused by the CFL hiring with <b>an</b> <b>unemployed</b> <b>worker.</b>|$|E
30|$|An {{increase}} in tightness, θ _l^j, {{makes it easier}} for <b>an</b> <b>unemployed</b> <b>worker</b> to find a job {{and at the same time}} harder for a firm to fill a vacancy. This improves the worker’s relative bargaining position, resulting in higher wage demands. An {{increase in}} search will instead increase the firm’s relative bargaining position. This is the case as firms will then find it easier to match with a new worker in case of no agreement. The improved bargaining position for firms moderates wage pressure.|$|E
40|$|Suppose that "uncertainty" about {{labor market}} {{conditions}} has increased. Does this change induce <b>an</b> <b>unemployed</b> <b>worker</b> to search longer, or shorter? This paper {{shows that the}} answer is drastically different depending on whether an increase in "uncertainty" is an increase in risk or that in true uncertainty in the sense of Frank Knight. We show in a general framework that, while an increase in risk (the mean-preserving spread of the wage distribution that the worker thinks she faces) increases the reservation wage, an increase in the Knightian uncertainty (a decrease in her confidence about the wage distribution) reduces it. ...|$|E

The treatments consist of weekly group meetings between <b>a</b> group of <b>unemployed</b> <b>workers</b> and 1 – 2 case workers (A), bi-weekly individual meetings between one <b>unemployed</b> <b>worker</b> and one case worker (B), early programme participation (C), and a combination of group meetings and early programme participation (D).|$|R

3000|$|The {{majority}} of Swedish wage earners {{are eligible for}} an income-dependent unemployment benefit administered by unemployment insurance funds. Prior to 2007, the before-tax replacement rate was 80 per cent for those with a wage income below a ceiling and above a floor. From 2007, the replacement rate was made dependent on unemployment duration. <b>An</b> <b>unemployed</b> <b>worker</b> with a previous income between {{the floor and the}} ceiling now faces a before-tax replacement rate of 80 per cent for the first 200  days. After 200  days, the replacement rate drops to 70 per cent for the next 100  days (250  days for parents of minors). After that, <b>an</b> <b>unemployed</b> <b>worker</b> receives 65 per cent of the earlier wage indefinitely within a labour market programme: the job and activity guarantee. The implication is a gradually falling replacement rate over an unemployment spell. Earlier, the maximum benefit level for the first 100  days of unemployment was SEK 730, but it was reduced to SEK 680 from 2007 so that the maximum benefit level is now the same throughout the unemployment spell. Since the maximum benefit levels have been fixed in nominal terms since 2002 (with the exception of the cut described above), there has been a gradual reduction in the replacement rate for high-income earners when their wages have increased. The minimum daily unemployment benefit has also been held constant (at SEK 320) since 2002, so those obtaining it (low-income earners and those who are not members of an insurance fund) have also experienced a gradual fall in the replacement rate. 2 [...]...|$|E
