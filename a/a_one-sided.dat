5|$|As a top-flight side, Manchester City {{entered the}} FA Cup {{in the third}} round, and were drawn at home to Reading of the Third Division. With City unusually wearing their maroon change kit, the match {{finished}} goalless, with Tony Coleman missing a penalty. The replay at Elm Park was <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> affair. City won 7–0, Mike Summerbee scoring a hat-trick. In the fourth round, another home tie finished 0–0, this time against Leicester City. In the replay Manchester City squandered a 2–0 lead and lost 4–3.|$|E

The third round of the cup saw Norwich win away at Watford 3–2. Norwich were two goals down on 55 minutes but a goal from Josh Murphy, who was making his professional début, on 77 minutes inspired an extra time comeback. Chris Hughton again made eight changes for the fifth round of the cup which saw Norwich travel to Manchester United where two late goals resulted in <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> looking 4–0 defeat.|$|E

This event brands him as an outsider {{in the eyes of}} the other children. Because they treat him with such abhorrence, his only solace comes in the form of unleashing his powers within the Colorado wilderness (uprooting trees, throwing huge boulders, leaping to the mountain tops, etc.). This stigma eventually wears off, though, and is forgotten by the time Danner enters high school.|$|E

5|$|The polling for {{the presidential}} {{election}} began on 15 July 2002 in Parliament and the state assemblies, with the media claiming that the election was <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone conclusion; the count was held on 18 July. Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an easy victory, and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July. Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, before becoming the President. Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Dr Zakir Hussain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the President of India.

5|$|After the Holland fight, Dyer {{made several}} {{attempts}} at a rematch with Darcy, reportedly {{to the exclusion}} of other fights, in the belief that the encounter would draw a big crowd and a large purse. The postponed fight with Delmen was again mooted, but this too never occurred. In the meantime Dyer continued to busy himself with charity work, setting up a boxing fund for injured soldiers in Sydney, and continued to tour the vaudeville circuit in New South Wales. Dyer's persistence eventually paid off, and an encounter with Darcy was arranged for 9 October at Rushcutters Bay Stadium, with the Middleweight Championship title at stake. The fight was <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> affair, with Dyer outclassed throughout. Although Darcy was warned for a low blow in the fourth round, Dyer was never in the fight and his corner threw in the towel after one minute of the sixth round.|$|E

5|$|In November 2004, Clinton {{announced}} that she would seek a second Senate term. Clinton easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini. The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance. Clinton's eventual opponent {{in the general election}} was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67percent of the vote to Spencer's 31percent, carrying all but four of New York's sixty-two counties. Her campaign spent $36 million for her re-election, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008. In the following months, she transferred $10 million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.|$|E
5|$|Queen's Park {{were invited}} {{to compete in the}} 1883–84 FA Cup, despite being from Scotland. They had {{previously}} been invited on several occasions from the 1871–72 competition onwards, but ultimately withdrew on each occasion. Their most successful runs had been in both 1871–72 and 1872–73 when they reached the semi-final each time before withdrawing. On each occasion since, they had withdrawn from the cup without playing any matches. Queen's 1883–84 FA Cup campaign began on 6 October 1883 with a 10–0 victory over Crewe Alexandra in the first round in front of a crowd of 2,000 spectators. The second round saw their first home game, and a 15–0 victory against Manchester F.C. on 1 December. It {{was the first time that}} an English cup match had been played in Scotland, and drew 6,000 fans. However the match was <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> affair, with Queen's Park dominating throughout to the extent that their goalkeeper was never required to handle the ball.|$|E
5|$|The 1974 {{series in}} the West Indies was of five Tests. The West Indian team were {{regarded}} as the better side, and for them to only draw the series was a surprise. After they won the first Test it had seemed that the series would become <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> contest. This Test was notable for a controversial Alvin Kallicharran run out that triggered protests. England managed to secure draws {{in the next three}} Tests, thanks to Dennis Amiss' 262 in the second Test and Keith Fletcher's 129 in the third, while rain prevented a result in the fourth Test. The last match at Queen's Park Oval was a close game, with England winning by 26 runs, primarily due to Tony Greig taking 13 wickets bowling off-spin and Boycott scoring 212 runs in the match. England thereby levelled the series, which finished 1–1.|$|E
