50|$|In Australia, the Yaris is {{available}} in hatchback and sedan forms. It comes in a 1.5-litre powered petrol engine. Models sold are the basic YR, the mid-range YRS, and the sportier YRX which features a sporty bumper with bodykit. Across the model lineup, a seven <b>airbag</b> <b>package</b> {{is available}} {{as part of the}} Enhanced Safety Pack option.|$|E
40|$|This masterâ€™s {{thesis is}} an {{evaluation}} of the environmental performance of a driver airbag, produced by Autoliv Sverige AB, by using cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Assessment methodology. The studied airbag is a pyrotechnical airbag, thus representing 80 % of types of airbag produced by Autoliv. Pyrotechnical airbags operate solely by the deployment of chemical mixtures, as opposed to hybrid airbags which also used compressed nitrogen. The study includes data collection by surveying the companies throughout the supply chain and conducting literature review for general data to supplement the site-specific data; calculating the environmental parameters; analyzing the results by locating dominant substances and processes; and comparing the environmental load of the <b>airbag</b> <b>package</b> with a complete car. The results of this LCA study shows that life cycle of one unit driver airbag may cause global warming equivalent to 31. 78 kg of CO 2, acidification equivalent to 50. 42 g of SO 2, eutrophication equivalent to 39. 35 g of NOx, resource depletion of 1. 52 E- 10 g/reservebase, toxicological impact to aquatic equivalents to 947. 73 m 3 of water, and 67. 78 g of contaminated bodyweight for human toxicity. The entire life cycle for one airbag also generates 4. 93 kg waste and consumes 569. 56 MJ energy and 79. 24 kg water. Dominant processes in the whole life cycle are steel production due to its high water and energy consumption, polyamide production due to its high energy consumption and various emissions, and the use phase due to its high fuel consumption. Some materials in the airbag system should be avoided for environmental consideration, mainly by reducing the weight of steel components and polyamide content in airbag module. In particular, zinc coating, used in steel production, is associated with a relatively large environmental loads. Further research should be directed to more finely detect areas of improvement with regard to weight reduction and raw material selection...|$|E
50|$|Safety {{features}} include dual front airbags, driver and passenger side airbags, and side curtain <b>airbags.</b> Three equipment <b>packages</b> include the Navigation Package (a DVD navigation system, a THX II-Certified, 14-speaker, 600-watt audio system with an AM/FM radio and six-disc in-dash CD player, and a rearview camera); Technology Package (adaptive HID headlights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, a forward-sensing system, a power sunshade for the rear window, and the intelligent access system with push button start); the Ultimate Package includes {{everything in the}} Navigation and Technology packages and a dual panel moonroof, premium 19x8-inch painted alloy wheels, Ultimate seating trim with color-keyed suede strip {{in the center of}} the seat back, and a Lincoln Star logo embroidered into the front seat headrests; an Aluminum Applique Package (aluminum dash trim in the place of wood, as well as a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob), is also available but requires the Navigation, Technology, or Ultimate packages. Options include all-wheel drive, 19x8-inch machined aluminum wheels, 20x8-inch polished aluminum wheels, adaptive cruise control, and a PowerCode remote starter.|$|R
