5|$|In 2011, an Australian <b>ant</b> allergy venom {{study was}} conducted, {{with the goal}} of {{determining}} which native Australian ants were associated with <b>ant</b> sting anaphylaxis. It showed that the jack jumper <b>ant</b> was responsible for the majority of patients' reactions to Myrmecia <b>ant</b> stings. Of the 265 patients who reacted to a sting from an <b>ant</b> belonging to the Myrmecia genus, 176 were from the jack jumper. 15 from M. nigrocincta and three from M. ludlowi, while 56 patients had reacted to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four native species of Australian ants caused anaphylaxis. Apart from Myrmecia species, the green-head <b>ant</b> (Rhytidoponera metallica) was also responsible for several systemic reactions.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>ant</b> {{species are}} {{considered}} as pests, primarily those {{that occur in}} human habitations, where their presence is often problematic. For example, the presence of ants would be undesirable in sterile places such as hospitals or kitchens. Some species or genera commonly categorized as pests include the Argentine <b>ant,</b> pavement <b>ant,</b> yellow crazy <b>ant,</b> banded sugar <b>ant,</b> Pharaoh <b>ant,</b> carpenter ants, odorous house <b>ant,</b> red imported fire <b>ant,</b> and European fire <b>ant.</b> Some ants will raid stored food, others may damage indoor structures, some can damage agricultural crops directly (or by aiding sucking pests), and some will sting or bite. The adaptive nature of <b>ant</b> colonies make it nearly impossible to eliminate entire colonies and most pest management practices aim to control local populations and tend to be temporary solutions. <b>Ant</b> populations are managed {{by a combination of}} approaches that make use of chemical, biological and physical methods. Chemical methods include the use of insecticidal bait which is gathered by ants as food and brought back to the nest where the poison is inadvertently spread to other colony members through trophallaxis. Management is based on the species and techniques can vary according to the location and circumstance.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the P. rebeli {{caterpillars}} benefit most when they parasitize off of the Myrmica schencki <b>ant</b> colony than any other <b>ant</b> colony. When Myrmica <b>ant</b> colonies encounter a period of food shortage, more P. rebeli caterpillars survive than if this food shortage were to occur in any other species of <b>ant</b> colony. This is because the P. rebeli caterpillars have a lower social rank in other <b>ant</b> species compared to their social rank in the M. schencki <b>ant</b> colony. This phenomenon is seen during times of stress, when some of the hungry P. rebeli caterpillars secrete compounds to attract attention from the <b>ant</b> colony it has parasitized. While the M. schencki ants are still fooled into believing that the P. rebeli are of their own brood, these compounds do not mimic those of non-host species' societies in other <b>ant</b> species, and thus, results in the P. rebeli being identified as intruders and killed.|$|E
50|$|There {{are only}} rare {{examples}} of stinging <b>ants.</b> Some notable examples include Solenopsis (fire <b>ants),</b> Pachycondyla, Myrmecia (bulldog <b>ants),</b> and Paraponera (bullet <b>ants).</b> In {{the case of}} fire <b>ants,</b> the venom consists of alkaloid and protein components. Stinging <b>ants</b> cause a cutaneous condition {{that is different from}} that caused by biting venomous <b>ants.</b> Particularly painful are stings from fire <b>ants,</b> although the bullet <b>ant's</b> sting is considered by some to be the most painful insect sting.|$|R
50|$|Tufted capuchins (Cebus apella) rub {{various parts}} of their body with {{carpenter}} <b>ants</b> (Camponotus ruﬁpes) or allow the <b>ants</b> to crawl over them, in a behaviour called <b>anting.</b> The capuchins often combine <b>anting</b> with urinating into their hands and mixing the <b>ants</b> with the urine.|$|R
40|$|Antthrushes (Formicarius, Chamaeza) {{sometimes}} {{walk around}} swarms of army <b>ants</b> and capture ground prey, {{but do not}} follow <b>ants</b> regularly. Among antpittas, only fast-leaping Pittasoma michleri and P. rufopileatum regularly follow <b>ants.</b> Gnateaters (Conopophaga) follow <b>ants</b> little. All these ground-foraging genera are poorly adapted for rapid flying, and failure to follow <b>ants</b> is perhaps due to inability to evade predators or out fly competitors near groups of birds attracted by <b>ants...</b>|$|R
5|$|While the Myrmica <b>ant</b> colony can {{identify}} {{each other through}} chemical signaling, social ranks are partially determined by sound acoustics. Therefore, once the P. rebeli begin to mimic {{the sound of the}} queen <b>ant,</b> the worker ants begin to treat the P. rebeli {{as if it were the}} queen <b>ant.</b> On the other hand, the queen <b>ant</b> treats the P. rebeli larvae and pupae as if they were rivals, as she is the only one in the colony that recognizes that the P. rebeli larvae is not <b>ant</b> larvae.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all species}} in the genus Myrmecia are found in Australia and its coastal islands. M. apicalis is the only species not native to Australia, and is only found in the Isle of Pines, New Caledonia. Only one <b>ant</b> has ever {{established}} nests outside its native range; M. brevinoda was first discovered in New Zealand in 1940, and the <b>ant</b> was recorded in Devonport in 1948, 1965 and 1981, where a single nest was destroyed. Sources suggest the <b>ant</b> was introduced to New Zealand through human activity; they were found inside a wooden crate brought from Australia. While no eradication attempt {{was made by the}} New Zealand government, the <b>ant</b> has not been found in the country since 1981 and is presumed to have been eradicated.|$|E
5|$|Although most ants survive {{attempts}} by humans to eradicate them, {{a few are}} highly endangered. These tend to be island species that have evolved specialized traits and risk being displaced by introduced <b>ant</b> species. Examples include the critically endangered Sri Lankan relict <b>ant</b> (Aneuretus simoni) and Adetomyrma venatrix of Madagascar.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ants</b> have long, broad, {{serrated}} jaws, {{used for}} digging, collecting food, fighting and cutting, and {{are probably the}} most important work tool <b>ants</b> possess. <b>Ants</b> typically bite each other when fighting. Some <b>ants</b> use mandibles to injure the enemy and squirt poison into the wound. Harvester <b>ants</b> use their mandibles to collect and carry seeds. Army <b>ants</b> have sharp mandibles that are better adapted for fighting than obtaining food or nursing the larvae. Carpenter <b>ants</b> make their nests in various wooden structures, which they hollow out with their sharp mandibles.|$|R
40|$|International audienceForaging in leaf-cutting <b>ants</b> is {{generally}} organized along well-defined recruitment trails supporting a bi-directional flow of outbound and nestbound individuals. This study attempts {{to reveal the}} priority rules governing the organization of traffic on these trails. <b>Ants</b> were forced to move on a narrow trail, allowing the passage of only two individuals at a time. In this condition, a desynchronization of inbound and outbound traffic was observed, involving the formation of alternating clusters of inbound and outbound <b>ants.</b> Most clusters of inbound <b>ants</b> were headed by laden <b>ants</b> followed by unladen <b>ants.</b> This occurred because inbound unladen <b>ants</b> {{did not attempt to}} overtake the laden <b>ants</b> in front of them. As unladen <b>ants</b> move on average faster than laden <b>ants,</b> these <b>ants</b> were thus forced to decrease their speed. By contrast, this decrease was counterbalanced by the fact that, by staying in a cluster instead of moving in isolation, inbound unladen <b>ants</b> limit the number of head-on encounters with outbound <b>ants.</b> Our analysis shows that the delay induced by these head-on encounters would actually be twice as high as the delay induced by the forced decrease in speed incurred by <b>ants</b> staying in a cluster. The cluster organization also promotes information transfer about the level of food availability by increasing the number of contacts between outbound and inbound laden <b>ants,</b> which could possibly stimulate these former to cut and retrieve leaf fragments when reaching the end of the trail...|$|R
5|$|<b>Ant</b> colonies can be long-lived. The queens {{can live}} {{for up to}} 30years, and workers live from 1 to 3years. Males, however, are more transitory, being quite {{short-lived}} and surviving {{for only a few}} weeks. <b>Ant</b> queens are estimated to live 100 times as long as solitary insects of a similar size.|$|E
5|$|Ants form {{symbiotic}} {{associations with}} a range of species, including other <b>ant</b> species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within <b>ant</b> nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this <b>ant</b> mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{identify}} kin and nestmates {{through their}} scent, {{which comes from}} hydrocarbon-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an <b>ant</b> is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony scent. Any <b>ant</b> that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked. Also, the reason why two separate colonies of ants will attack each other {{even if they are}} of the same species is because the genes responsible for pheromone production are different between them. The Argentine <b>ant,</b> however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic diversity, and has become a global pest because of it.|$|E
50|$|Solenopsis spp. <b>ants</b> can be {{identified}} by three body features—a pedicel with two nodes, an unarmed propodeum, and antennae with 10 segments plus a two-segmented club. Many <b>ants</b> bite, and formicine <b>ants</b> can cause irritation by spraying formic acid; myrmecine <b>ants</b> like fire <b>ants</b> have a dedicated venom-injecting sting, which injects an alkaloid venom, as well as mandibles for biting.|$|R
25|$|Termites are detritivores and {{therefore}} do not exhibit pursuit behaviors, however <b>ants</b> and wasps {{can be highly}} predatory and are known to pursue prey in groups. For example, termite-hunting <b>ants</b> of the genus Pachycondyla, also known as Matabele <b>ants,</b> form raiding parties consisting of <b>ants</b> of different castes, such as soldier <b>ants</b> and worker <b>ants.</b> Soldier <b>ants</b> are much larger than worker <b>ants,</b> with more powerful mandibles and more robust exoskeletons, and so they make up {{the front lines of}} raiding parties and are responsible for killing prey. Workers usually butcher and carry off the killed prey, while supporting the soldiers. The raiding parties are highly mobile and move aggressively into the colonies of termites, often breaking through their outer defenses and entering their mounds. The <b>ants</b> do not completely empty the mound of termites, instead they only take a few, allowing the termites to recover their numbers so that the <b>ants</b> have a steady stream of prey.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{apparent}} biological interactions affecting termites is predation by vertebrates and invertebrates. <b>Ants</b> {{are the most important}} predators of other invertebrates and are the most active and effective predators of termites. Also, <b>ants</b> and termites might heavily compete for nesting space. Considering the potential of <b>ants</b> as competitors and predators of termites and the scarce knowledge of how they interact we tested the effects of the presence of <b>ants</b> on the activity of arboreal termites. Predatory <b>ants</b> had a negative effect on arboreal termite activity, and non-predatory <b>ants</b> had no effect. Specialized predatory <b>ants</b> are an important disturbance factor in resource exploitation by termites. Perhaps competition with non-predatory <b>ants</b> did not occur in our study because the foraging territories of <b>ants</b> and termites maybe do not overlap. Hence, it is clear that predation has a big impact on activity of termites, but the role of competition in shaping termite communities still needs further study, especially the competitive interaction between termites and <b>ants...</b>|$|R

5|$|Cyclotorna monocentra moths feed on meat <b>ant</b> broods. The larvae {{of these}} moths are parasites to leafhoppers and {{will move to}} meat <b>ant</b> colonies to {{complete}} their development, where they will proceed to consume the brood; the females lay many eggs near <b>ant</b> trails which {{are close to the}} leafhoppers tended by ants. Other observations show that the Iphierga macarista larvae are scavengers in meat <b>ant</b> nests, while Sphallomorpha beetles live in burrows near nests of meat ants, where the larvae capture and prey on workers passing by. The larvae of the spitfire sawfly and Pseudoperga guerini are able to regurgitate a fluid against the meat <b>ant</b> if they are getting attacked by them; depending on how much is regurgitated, an <b>ant</b> will either walk away and clean itself or become fatally affected by it. Lizards such as the thorny dragon, which is a sit and wait predator, consume meat ants, but other lizards which eat Iridomyrmex ants usually reject this species.|$|E

500|$|Banded sugar <b>ants</b> are omnivores {{and feed}} on sweet substances. They tend plant-eating insects such as aphids, and {{feed on the}} fluids they secrete.

5|$|Myrmecia nigrocincta, {{commonly}} known as the jumper <b>ant</b> or jumping jack, is an <b>ant</b> of the genus Myrmecia. The species was first described by Frederick Smith in 1858. Colonies of this <b>ant</b> are abundant in eastern Australia. Ants of this species are known for their ability to jump several inches, and they also have a powerful, venomous sting. Rather than foraging on the ground, M. nigrocincta prefer to forage in trees where they are known to pollinate certain flowers.|$|E
5|$|P. rebeli live in {{different}} habitats; therefore, {{they do not}} parasitize the same Myrmica <b>ant</b> species. Through observation and experimentation, researchers found that if P. rebeli try to parasitize a different Myrmica <b>ant</b> species than the one they normally do, the Myrmica ants will identify the P. rebeli larvae as intruders and will kill 100% of the P. rebeli larvae. The differences between the P. rebeli are that they synthesize different hydrocarbons, which allow them to mimic different species of Myrmica ants. This explains why they have no success in being mistaken for another species of Myrmica <b>ant</b> and the ensuing 100% mortality rate when the other Myrmica <b>ant</b> species is not fooled.|$|E

5|$|Parasitic <b>ant</b> species {{enter the}} colonies of host ants and {{establish}} themselves as social parasites; {{species such as}} Strumigenys xenos are entirely parasitic {{and do not have}} workers, but instead, rely on the food gathered by their Strumigenys perplexa hosts. This form of parasitism is seen across many <b>ant</b> genera, but the parasitic <b>ant</b> is usually a species that is closely related to its host. A variety of methods are employed to enter the nest of the host <b>ant.</b> A parasitic queen may enter the host nest before the first brood has hatched, establishing herself prior to development of a colony scent. Other species use pheromones to confuse the host ants or to trick them into carrying the parasitic queen into the nest. Some simply fight their way into the nest.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} <b>ant</b> {{are known to}} capture {{termites}} {{to use as a}} fresh food source later on, rather than killing them. For example, Formica nigra captures termites, and those who try to escape are immediately seized and driven underground. Certain species of ants in the subfamily Ponerinae conduct these raids although other <b>ant</b> species go in alone to steal the eggs or nymphs. Ants such as Megaponera analis attack the outside the mounds and Dorylinae ants attack underground. Despite this, some termites and ants can coexist peacefully. Some species of termite, including Nasutitermes corniger, form associations with certain <b>ant</b> species to keep away predatory <b>ant</b> species. The earliest known association between Azteca ants and Nasutitermes termites date back to the Oligocene to Miocene period.|$|E
