5|$|Enron's complex {{financial}} statements were confusing to shareholders <b>and</b> <b>analysts.</b> In addition, its complex business model and unethical practices {{required that the}} company use accounting limitations to misrepresent earnings and modify the balance sheet to indicate favorable performance.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{investigation}} {{did not find}} any considerable evidence linking Kocharyan to the Hunanyan group, many Armenian politicians <b>and</b> <b>analysts</b> believe that President Robert Kocharyan and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan were behind the assassination of Vazgen Sargsyan and other leading politicians. In January 2000, investigators alleged that several members of the President Robert Kocharian's inner circle may have been behind the October 27 shooting, promoting some opposition figures to call for Kocharian's resignation. However, Kocharyan gradually consolidated his power throughout the year to emerge as the most powerful figure in the country's leadership.|$|E
5|$|As {{they share}} many {{cross-platform}} games and {{compete for the}} same audience as their predecessors, frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The PS3 uses the Blu-ray format, while the Xbox 360 uses a standard DVD9. The Xbox 360 is less expensive to produce, <b>and</b> <b>analysts</b> expect that a mid-revision will allow Microsoft to break-even on manufacturing costs, while industry consensus is that the Xbox 360's conventional architecture is easier to develop for.|$|E

5|$|Discussion {{continues}} {{about the}} relative advantage or disadvantage of using the blades. Researchers <b>and</b> <b>analysts</b> {{also point out that}} the research studies are done on level, stationary treadmills, and do not measure performance from starting blocks or on actual curved tracks. They also do not take into account differences in physiology between amputees and non-amputees, who have such factors as musculature, blade height and weight and differences in blood circulation patterns due to the history of their limb loss.|$|E
5|$|From March 2013, {{concerns}} over further currency war diminished, though in November several journalists <b>and</b> <b>analysts</b> warned {{of a possible}} fresh outbreak. The likely principal source of tension appeared to shift once again, this time not being the U.S. versus China or the Eurozone versus Japan, but the U.S. versus Germany. In late October U.S. treasury officials had criticized Germany for running an excessively large current account surplus, thus acting as a drag on the global economy.|$|E

Given these achievements, many players <b>and</b> <b>analysts</b> consider Federer the greatest tennis player of all time.|$|E

5|$|India's {{labour force}} is growing by 2.5% every year, but {{employment}} is growing only at 2.3% a year. Official unemployment exceeds 9%. Regulation and other obstacles have discouraged {{the emergence of}} formal businesses and jobs. Almost 30% of workers are casual workers who work only when {{they are able to}} get jobs and remain unpaid {{for the rest of the}} time. Only 10% of the workforce is in regular employment. India's labour regulations are heavy even by developing country standards <b>and</b> <b>analysts</b> have urged the government to abolish them.|$|E
5|$|Not {{until the}} 21st century did players <b>and</b> <b>analysts</b> begin to revive Black's chances in this line. First, Watson {{showed that the}} {{disruptive}} check 9...Qh4+ was playable, the point being that after 10.g3 White is {{no longer able to}} bring the bishop on c1 to the squares g3 or h4, where it can assist in White's kingside attack. Later players such as Gashimov showed that the queen check is not mandatory, and that Black also retains good chances in the line 9...0-0 10.Nf3 Na6 11.0-0 Nb4, taking advantage of the outpost on b4.|$|E
5|$|Other economists <b>and</b> <b>analysts</b> {{have argued}} that the {{underground}} economy would continue to bear the same tax burden as before. They state that replacing the current tax system with a consumption tax would not change the tax revenue generated from the underground economy—while illicit income is not taxed directly, spending of income from illicit activity results in business income and wages that are taxed.|$|E

5|$|Peyton Manning and Leaf {{were widely}} {{considered}} {{the two best}} players available in the 1998 draft, and scouts <b>and</b> <b>analysts</b> debated who should be selected first.

5|$|The European Council on Foreign Relations <b>and</b> <b>analysts</b> {{suggest the}} Eurasian Union {{includes}} strategic interests {{as well as}} economic interests for its member states, especially Russia. In order to link both Europe and East Asia, Russia seeks to develop its eastern regions to increase its access to Asian markets. Russia’s Far East has gained even more importance due to its proximity to alternative markets since the European Union and United States imposed sanctions on Russia following the crisis in Ukraine.|$|E

They {{were originally}} twenty-one, but seven were tried in absentia {{and one was}} released in April 2012.

5|$|Urlacher was {{considered}} one of the most talented collegiate prospects in the 2000 NFL Draft, and impressed spectators <b>and</b> <b>analysts</b> at the NFL Scouting Combine by bench pressing 225 pounds twenty-seven times, and completing the forty-yard dash in 4.57 seconds. The Chicago Bears, who were in need of a defensive playmaker after having the 29th ranked defense in 1999, selected Urlacher in the first round, as the draft's ninth overall pick.|$|E
5|$|After Maryland {{suffered}} a fifth {{loss in the}} season closer against Boston College, it was very unlikely that the team's preferred postseason game, the Meineke Car Care Bowl, would extend an invitation. The game's selection committee in Charlotte, North Carolina was eager to secure nearby North Carolina (8–4). Meanwhile, the EagleBank Bowl, hosted by RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., {{not far from the}} Maryland campus, secured in-state rival Navy, but the game date conflicted with Maryland's final exams. Soon after Maryland's regular season finale, sportswriters <b>and</b> <b>analysts</b> speculated that the Humanitarian Bowl in Boise, Idaho, was the most likely postseason destination. Bowl officials there worked to secure a game of undefeated teams between the hometown team, Boise State, and Ball State of the Mid-American Conference. However, Ball State rejected the proposal to play at Boise State's homefield as unacceptable.|$|E

5|$|Critics <b>and</b> <b>analysts</b> deemed Windows RT to be commercially unsuccessful, citing these limitations, its unclear, uncompetitive {{position}} of sitting as an underpowered system between Windows Phone and Windows 8, {{and the introduction}} of Windows 8 devices with battery life and functionality that met or exceeded that of Windows RT devices. Improvements to Intel's mobile processors, along with a decision by Microsoft to remove OEM license fees for Windows on devices with screens smaller than 9 inches, spurred a market for low-end Wintel tablets running the full Windows 8 platform. These devices largely cannibalized Windows RT; vendors began phasing out their Windows RT devices due to poor sales, and {{less than a year after}} its release, Microsoft suffered a US$900 million loss that was largely blamed on poor sales of the ARM-based Surface tablet and unsold stock.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman {{surrendered}} a {{home run}} but recorded his 550th save on August 14, 2008 in a 3–2 victory over the Brewers. On September 19, 2008, Hoffman finished an 11–6 14-inning win over the Washington Nationals for his 900th career MLB game. Hoffman's 30th and last save of the season, a 3–2 win over the Pirates, ensured the Padres would not lose 100 games that season. The Padres finished with a 63–99 record after being projected by the team <b>and</b> <b>analysts</b> to win 87–90games. Hoffman ended the 2008 season 3–6 with a 3.77 ERA and 30 in 34 save opportunities. He tied for sixth in the NL in saves. Hoffman reached 20 or more saves for the 14th time to set a new MLB record. He had a 5.14 ERA through his first 29 appearances and a 1.56 ERA in his last 19 appearances of the season.|$|E

Although the Hokies won the ACC {{for the second time}} in less than four years, fans <b>and</b> <b>analysts</b> anticipated Virginia Tech would spend 2008 rebuilding a team that saw 12 starters graduate or enter the National Football League (NFL) Draft. Though picked in a preseason poll to win the Coastal Division of the ACC, the Hokies were upset in their season opener by East Carolina University.|$|E
