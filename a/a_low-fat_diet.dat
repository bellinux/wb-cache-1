25|$|There is {{evidence}} that prediabetes is a curable disease state. Intensive weight loss and lifestyle intervention, if sustained, may improve glucose tolerance substantially and prevent progression from IGT to type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study found a 16% reduction in diabetes risk for every kilogram of weight loss. Reducing weight by 7% through <b>a</b> <b>low-fat</b> <b>diet</b> and performing 150 minutes of exercise a week is the goal. In observational studies, individuals following vegetarian diets are about half as likely to develop diabetes, compared with non-vegetarians. The ADA guidelines recommend modest weight loss (5-10% body weight), moderate-intensity exercise (30 minutes daily), and smoking cessation.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} focused on diets that reduce {{calories}} via a low-carbohydrate (Atkins diet, Scarsdale diet, Zone diet) diet versus <b>a</b> <b>low-fat</b> <b>diet</b> (LEARN diet, Ornish diet). The Nurses' Health Study, an observational cohort study, found that low carbohydrate diets based on vegetable sources of fat and protein are associated with less coronary heart disease. The same study also found no correlation (with multivariate adjustment) between animal fat intake and coronary heart disease (table 4). A long term study that monitored 43,396 Swedish women however suggests that a low carbohydrate-high protein diet, used on a regular basis and without consideration of the nature of carbohydrates or the source of proteins, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|After observing in {{southern}} Italy the highest concentration of centenarians in the world, Keys hypothesized that a Mediterranean-style diet low in animal fat protected {{against heart disease}} and that a diet high in animal fats led to heart disease. The results of what later {{became known as the}} Seven Countries Study appeared to show that serum cholesterol was strongly related to coronary heart disease mortality both at the population and at the individual level. As a result, in 1956 representatives of the American Heart Association appeared on television to inform people that a diet which included large amounts of butter, lard, eggs, and beef would lead to coronary heart disease. This resulted in the American government recommending that people adopt <b>a</b> <b>low-fat</b> <b>diet</b> in order to prevent heart disease.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE — We {{sought to}} {{investigate}} whether <b>a</b> <b>low-fat</b> vegan <b>diet</b> improves glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors in individuals with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Individuals with type 2 diabetes (n 99) {{were randomly assigned to}} <b>a</b> <b>low-fat</b> vegan <b>diet</b> (n 49) or a diet following the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines (n 50). Participants were evaluated at baseline and 22 weeks. RESULTS — Forty-three percent (21 of 49) of the vegan group and 26 % (13 of 50) of the ADA group participants reduced diabetes medications. Including all participants, HbA 1 c (A 1 C) de-creased 0. 96 percentage points in the vegan group and 0. 56 points in the ADA group (P 0. 089). Excluding those who changed medications, A 1 C fell 1. 23 points in the vegan group compared with 0. 38 points in the ADA group (P 0. 01). Body weight decreased 6. 5 kg in the vegan group and 3. 1 kg in the ADA group (P 0. 001). Body weight change correlated with A 1 C change (r 0. 51, n 57, P 0. 0001). Among those who did not change lipid-lowering medications, LDL cholesterol fell 21. 2 % in the vegan group and 10. 7 % in the ADA group (P 0. 02). After adjustment for baseline values, urinary albumin reductions were greater in the vegan group (15. 9 mg/ 24 h) than in the ADA group (10. 9 mg/ 24 h) (P 0. 013). CONCLUSIONS — Both <b>a</b> <b>low-fat</b> vegan <b>diet</b> and <b>a</b> diet based on ADA guidelines improved glycemic and lipid control in type 2 diabetic patients. These improvements were greater with <b>a</b> <b>low-fat</b> vegan <b>diet.</b> Diabetes Care 29 : 1777 – 1783, 2006 D iabetes prevalence is relatively lowamong individuals following plant-based and vegetarian diets, and clinical trials using such diets have shown improvements in glycemic control and cardiovascular health (1, 2).

40|$|Feeding {{previously}} starved chicks with <b>a</b> high-carbohydrate, <b>low-fat</b> <b>diet</b> stimulates <b>a</b> 9 -fold {{increase in}} both the rate of synthesis of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and the abundance of its mRNA in liver. To define the steps involved in mediating diet-induced changes in the abundance of ACC mRNA, transcriptional activity was measured with the nuclear run-on assay and multiple DNA probes specific to the ACC gene. ACC transcription was low in livers of starved chicks; feeding them with <b>a</b> high-carbohydrate, <b>low-fat</b> <b>diet</b> induced ACC transcription, increasing it 11 -fold. An increase in transcription was detectable at 1 h, was maximal at 5 h and remained high for 26 h. Feeding previously starved chicks with a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet stimulated a smaller increase (4 -fold) in the abundance of ACC mRNA and the transcription of ACC than feeding with <b>a</b> high-carbohydrate, <b>low-fat</b> <b>diet.</b> The half-life of ACC mRNA in liver, as estimated from the kinetics of accumulation and decay of ACC mRNA during high-carbohydrate feeding and starvation, was not changed significantly by dietary manipulation. ACC mRNA was expressed at low levels in heart, pectoral muscle, kidney and brain. The abundance of ACC mRNA in these tissues was not affected by nutritional manipulation. These results demonstrate that nutritional control of the abundance of ACC mRNA in the chicken is liver-specific and is mediated primarily by changes {{in the rate of}} transcription of the ACC gene...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE — Nonalcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease is highly {{prevalent}} in obese and {{type 2 diabetic}} individuals and is strongly associated with dyslipidemia and inflammation. Weight loss and/or pharmacotherapy are commonly used to correct these abnormalities. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We performed a 16 -week intervention trial of <b>a</b> hypocaloric, <b>low-fat</b> <b>diet</b> plus 10 mg/day ezetimibe (n � 15) versus <b>a</b> hypocaloric, <b>low-fat</b> <b>diet</b> alone (n � 10) on intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content, plasma high sensitivity–Creactive protein (hs-CRP), adipocytokines, and fetuin-A concentrations and apolipoprotein (apo) B- 100 kinetics in obese subjects.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the impact on blood {{pressure}} and different metabolic parameters of a weight-loss program on obese dogs fed on <b>a</b> <b>low-fat</b> high-fibre <b>diet</b> and treated with and without mitratapide. The study sample consisted of 36 obese dogs, randomly assigned to a control group (n= 17), which were fed on <b>a</b> <b>low-fat</b> high-fibre <b>diet,</b> and <b>an</b> intervention group (n= 19), fed on the same diet and treated with mitratapide. Variables measured included body condition score, body weight, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures; total cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels; alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activity, measured both at baseline (day 0) and at the end of the weight loss program (day 85). All the studied parameters had decreased in both groups at the end of the study; these being diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and alanine aminotransferase, significantly lower in dogs treated with mitratapide. The use of mitrapide in addition to <b>low-fat</b> high-fibre <b>diet</b> does not seem to offer any further useful effect in the loss of weight during the treatment of canine obesity.
