50|$|Sectional: the {{structure}} is divided into usually two sections with insulators between, usually center-fed. This collinear arrangement enhances low-angle (ground wave) radiation and reduces high-angle (sky wave) radiation. This increases {{the distance to the}} mush zone where the ground wave and sky wave are at similar strength at night. This type of antenna is known as an <b>anti-fading</b> <b>aerial.</b> Practical sectionals with 120 over 120 degrees, 180 over 120 degrees and 180 over 180 degrees are presently in operation with good results.|$|E
50|$|The mediumwave {{transmitter}} Flevoland (Middengolf Zendstation Flevoland) is a broadcasting {{facility for}} medium wave near Zeewolde {{in the province}} of Flevoland, Netherlands, situated at 5°25′ E and 52°23′ N.It has been used for broadcasting on 747 kHz (until September 2015) and 1008 kHz with a nominal power of 400 kilowatts. As aerial two guyed steel framework masts with a height of 195 metres are used, which form an <b>anti-fading</b> <b>aerial.</b> These masts are grounded and carry a cage aerial, which is upperward the separation insulator, separating the masts in a height of 95 metres in two parts, connected toward the mast construction. The radiation diagram is directional, with a maximum gain of 4 dB in South-Eastern direction, to compensate for the variation in electrical admittance of terrain in the Netherlands.|$|E
