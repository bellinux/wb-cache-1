40|$|A {{previous}} paper [Applied Acoustics 66 (2005) 709 – 730] {{has shown}} that adding a quadratic residue diffuser (QRD) {{to the top of}} a T-shape barrier can provide better barrier performance than an equivalent purely <b>absorptive</b> <b>barrier.</b> In here, we extend the study to look at the performance when a QRD is made absorptive. This paper presents an investigation on the acoustic performance of a few welled-diffusers with different absorption ability on top of a T-shape noise barrier. The absorption properties of the diffusers are modified with different sequences, by filling the wells with fiberglass, by covering the well entrance with wire meshes, and by putting perforated sheet either on the top surface or inside the wells. A 2 D Boundary Element Method (BEM) is used to calculate the barrier insertion loss. The numerical and experimental results on diffuser barriers with rigid and absorptive covers are compared. Among the tested models the best method of treating diffuser barriers with absorbent agents in the QRD is found to be a perorated sheet on top or inside the diffuser wells. It is found that increasing the absorption ability of QRD by fiberglass or high resistance wire meshes has negative effect on the efficiency of a QRD barrier. It is shown that, if the increase in absorption destroys the effect of resonance in wells, it will also have negative effect on the insertion loss performance of the QRD edge barrier. © Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{expression}} profiles of a drug metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3 A 62 mRNA in the intestine and liver of normal male Wistar rats, and its regional differences in the intestinal tract. Nine-week-old male rats were used, and their intestine were divided equally into nine segments. The expression patterns of CYP 3 A 62 mRNA in the intestine and liver were examined using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The PCR products for CYP 3 A 62 mRNA were readily detectable in the intestine of normal male rats, whereas no bands for CYP 3 A 62 mRNA were detected in the liver using similar PCR conditions as those used in the intestine. The expression of CYP 3 A 62 mRNA was found to be high in the jejunum, and stable until the bottom of the small intestine. Only the decreased expression pattern in the bottom of the intestine was contradictory to our previous findings on CYP 3 A 9 and CYP 3 A 18 mRNAs. Unlike other CYPs of the CYP 3 A subfamily, CYP 3 A 62 was found to be predominant in the intestine rather than the liver of normal male Wistar rats. This suggests that CYP 3 A 62 also has an important role in the detoxification of xenobiotics similar to endogenous substances as an <b>absorptive</b> <b>barrier</b> in the intestine. These findings may help the evaluation of gastrointestinal drug absorption and drug-drug interaction in rats...|$|E
2500|$|Sound barrier walls vary in cost {{depending}} on the type and quality. [...] Concrete is popular due to lower cost. Since they are reflective, they could potentially create noise for those across from the <b>barrier.</b> [...] <b>Absorptive</b> <b>barriers</b> absorb, and thus abate the noise more effectively, but cost more as they are often custom built and are composed of a variety of materials that allow for absorption. [...] With regard to berm construction costs, a major factor is the availability of excess soil in the immediate area which could be used for berm construction. If the soil is present, it is often cheaper to construct an earth berm noise barrier than to haul away the excess dirt, provided there is sufficient land area available for berm construction. Generally a four-to-one ratio of berm cross sectional width to height is required. Thus, for example, to build a [...] berm, one needs an available width of [...]|$|R

40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{of a study}} of a performance of various track-side railway noise barriers, determined by using a two- dimensional numerical boundary element model. The basic model uses monopole sources and has been adapted to allow the sources to exhibit dipole-type radiation characteristics. A comparison of boundary element predictions {{of the performance of}} simple barriers and vehicle shapes is made with results obtained by using the standard U. K. prediction method. The results obtained from the numerical model indicate that modifying the source to exhibit dipole characteristics becomes more significant as the height of the barrier increases, and suggest that for any particular shape, absorbent barriers provide much better screening efficiency than the rigid equivalent. The cross-section of the rolling stock significantly affects the performance of rigid barriers. If the position of the upper edge is fixed, the results suggest that simple <b>absorptive</b> <b>barriers</b> provide more effective screening than tilted barriers.

40|$|Background {{and aims}}   Traffic noise {{barriers}} {{are the most}} important measure to control the environmental noise pollution. Diffraction from top edge of noise barriers is the most important path of indirect sound wave moves towards receiver. Therefore, most studies are focused on  improvement of this kind.   Methods   T-shape profile barriers {{are one of the most}} successful barrier among many different profiles. In this investigation the theory of destructive effect of diffracted waves from real edge of barrier and the wave diffracted from image of the barrier with phase difference of radians is used. Firstly a simple mathematical representation of the zones behind rigid and absorbent T- shape barriers with the highest insertion loss using the destructive effect of indirect path via barrier  image is introduced and then two different profile reflective and absorption barrier is used for  verification of the introduced model   Results   The results are then compared with the results of a verified two dimensional boundary element method at 1 / 3 octave band frequencies and in a wide field behind those barriers. Avery good agreement between the results has been achieved. In this method effective height is used for any different profile barriers.   Conclusion   The introduced model is very simple, flexible and fast and could be used for choosing the best location of profile rigid and <b>absorptive</b> <b>barriers</b> to achieve the highest  performance. ...|$|R

World J Gastroenterol, 2001; 7 (2) : 270 - 274 AIM To determine whether diabetic care {{can be improved}} by combination of voglibose and gymnemic acid (GA), we compared the combinative and individual effects of voglibose and GA on maltose absorption in small intestine. METHODS The small intestine 30 cm long from 2 cm caudal ward Treitz’s ligament of Wistar rat {{was used as an}} in situ loop, which was randomly perfused in recircular mode with maltose (10 mmol/L) with or without different dosages of voglibose and/or GA for an hour. To compare the time course, perfusion of 10 mmol/L maltose was repeated four times. Each time continued for 1 hour and separated by 30 minutes rinse. In the first time, lower dosages of GA (0. 5 g/L) and/or voglibose (2 µmol/L) were contained except control. RESULTS Absorptive rate of maltose was the lowest in combinative group (P< 0. 05, ANOVA), for example, the inhibition rate was about 37 % during the first hour when 0. 5 g/L-GA and 2 µmol/L voglibose with 10 mmol/L maltose were perfused in the loop. The onset time was shortened to 30 minutes and the effective duration was prolonged to 4 hours with the combination; therefore the total amount of maltose absorption during the effective duration was inhibited more significantly than that in the individual administration (P< 0. 05, U test of Mann Whitney). The effect of GA on <b>absorptive</b> <b>barriers</b> of the intestine {{played an important role in}} the combinative effects. CONCLUSION There are augmented effects of voglibose and GA.

40|$|Cardiac {{surgery is}} {{associated}} with a low incidence of GI complications, but with a disproportionate mortality. A number of risk factors have become established which identify patients at risk. CPB {{is associated with}} profound reductions in mucosal blood flow. Mesenteric perfusion is altered by primary endothelial dysfunction, which may further be exacerbated by the use of vasoconstrictors during CPB; inflammatory mediators can 'prime' the mesenteric vasculature. Cardiac surgery with or without CPB is associated with increased tissue oxygen demands, particularly by the splanchnic bed. The disparity in general and regional oxygen supply and demand results in the development of mucosal hypoxia and this cannot be attributed to CPB alone. This injury is measurable by reductions in both <b>absorptive</b> and <b>barrier</b> functions of the gut. Protection may be conferred by modulating the perfusion protocol during bypass and pharmacological interventions which modify the inflammatory response to surgery...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University, 12 / 11 / 1999. The performance of various designs of outdoor noise barrier has been investigated using numerical modelling and full scale experiments. The numerical modelling has been performed using a two-dimensional boundary element method. The model has been extended to allow the efficient simulation of barrier arrangements on ground having two distinct impedance values and cross-sections incorporating cuttings. It has been reported previously that {{the performance of a}} plane screen can be enhanced by adding a device {{to the top of the}} barrier to induce destructive interference. Full scale modelling and boundary element simulations have been performed on one such commercially available device. It has been shown that, taking the height increase into account, the major contribution to the improved performance is the presence of two diffracting edges rather than any interference effects generated. It is known that the performance of a single barrier is degraded following the introduction of a barrier on the opposite side of a source. Boundary element simulations of such parallel arrangements have been performed. Modifications have been proposed to reduce the over-estimation of multiple reflections within the model, together with a method for converting predictions to the equivalent point source values. Sound absorptive, tilted and median barriers have been shown to be effective in reducing the degradation. A multiple-edge barrier configuration is known to offer improved screening performance over a plane screen. Reported in-situ measurements have suggested the behaviour to be influenced by site geometry. Boundary element calculations have been performed to identify a more efficient variant of the device. The results suggest the addition of an inclined base panel to be most effective. The boundary element model has been used to investigate the effect of shape and surface treatment upon railway noise barriers. The model has been adapted to allow the use of dipole sources characteristic of railway noise. The cross-section of the rolling stock has been shown to affect the performance of rigid barriers. If the upper edges are coincident, the results suggest that simple <b>absorptive</b> <b>barriers</b> provide better screening than tilted designs. The addition of multiple edges further enhances performance. EPSRC; Transport Research Laborator...|$|R
40|$|Environmental enteric {{dysfunction}} (EED) is {{a disease}} of the small intestine affecting children and adults in low and middle income countries. Arising {{as a consequence of}} repeated infections, gut inflammation results in impaired intestinal <b>absorptive</b> and <b>barrier</b> function, leading to poor nutrient uptake and ultimately to stunting and other developmental limitations. Progress towards new biomarkers and interventions for EED is hampered by the practical and ethical difficulties of cross-validation with the gold standard of biopsy and histology. Optical biopsy techniques — which can provide minimally invasive or noninvasive alternatives to biopsy — could offer other routes to validation and could potentially be used as point-of-care tests among the general population. This Consensus Statement identifies and reviews the most promising candidate optical biopsy technologies for applications in EED, critically assesses them against criteria identified for successful deployment in developing world settings, and proposes further lines of enquiry. Importantly, many of the techniques discussed could also be adapted to monitor the impaired intestinal barrier in other settings such as IBD, autoimmune enteropathies, coeliac disease, graft-versus-host disease, small intestinal transplantation or critical care...|$|R

40|$|Background. Intestinal {{transplantation}} (ITx) faces {{many challenges}} {{due to the}} complexity of surgery and to the multiple immunological reactions that lead to the necessity of rigorous follow-up for early detection of acute cellular rejection (ACR). Our aim was to determine the kinetics of ACR using an experimental ITx model, with emphasis in the characterization of the process using different approaches, including the use of functional assays of <b>absorptive</b> and <b>barrier</b> function. Methods. ITx in rats conducting serial sampling was performed. Clinical monitoring, graft histology, proinflammatory gene expression, and nitrosative stress determination were performed. Also, glucose absorption, barrier function using ovalbumin translocation, and contractile function were analyzed. Results. The model used reproduced the different stages of ACR. Allogeneic ITx recipients showed signs of rejection from postoperative day (POD) 5, with increasing severity until 12 POD. Histological evaluation showed mild rejection in early sampling and severe rejection at late stages, with alterations in all graft layers. IL- 6, CXCL 10, IFNg, and nitrite plasmas levels showed behavior coincident with histopathology. Remarkably, allogeneic grafts showed a marked alteration of glucose absorptive capacity from POD 5 that was sustained until endpoint. Coincidently, barrier function alteration was evidenced by luminal ovalbumin translocation to serum. Contractile function was progressively impaired along ACR. Conclusions. Glucose absorption and barrier function are altered at early stages of ACR when histological alterations or gene expression changes were much subtle. This observation may provide simple evaluation tools that could be eventually translated to the clinics to contribute to early ACR diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation on the acoustic performance of vertical profile parallel barriers with quadratic residue diffuser tops and faces. A 2 D boundary element method (BEM) is used to predict the barrier insertion loss. The results of rigid and with absorptive coverage are also calculated for comparisons. Using QRD on the top surface and faces of all vertical profile parallel barrier models presented here is found to improve the efficiency of barriers compared with fully <b>absorptive</b> equivalent parallel <b>barrier</b> at the examined receiver positions. It is found that reducing the design frequency of QRD shifts the performance improvement towards lower frequency, and therefore the most efficient model for vertical profile parallel traffic noise barrier is a setup treated with QRDs tuned to around 400 Hz. The overall performance improvement by the above diffusive barrier is predicted to be 5. 8 dB (A) compared to its rigid equivalent barrier. It is also found that if increase in absorption coefficient of QRD by well reduction destroys the effect of wells in resonance; it will also have negative effect on the performance of parallel QRD barrier and will reduce the overall A-weighted insertion loss of the reactive barriers...|$|R

Intra-litter pairs of pigs In = 36) weaned at 28 cl, were fed the vehicle (control) or the extract (providing 1. 5 mg FB 1 /kg body weight) daily for 9 d starting 7 d postweaning. After slaughter, the jejunal mucosa of pigs was mounted in Ussing chambers (UC). Extract consumption for 9 d decreased the gain:feed ratio (P = 0. 04) and increased liver weight (P = 0. 01). Basal net ion secretion (P = 0. 02), sodium-dependent glucose absorption (P = 0. 02), and theophylline-induced secretion (P < 0. 01) of the jejunal mucosa determined in UC were higher in pigs fed the extract than in controls. By contrast, jejunal permeability to the horseradish peroxidase model protein in UC was not influenced by extract consumption. Ileal villi tended to be longer (P = 0. 07) and jejunal aminopeptidase N activity was lower (P < 0. 01) in pigs fed the extract. In conclusion, consumption of an extract rich in fumonisins for 9 d {{has the potential to}} alter intestinal physiology, villous architecture, and enzyme activities.

40|$|In a {{previous}} research project [SPR 2418; 2 ̆ 2 Study {{of the performance}} of acoustic barriers for Indiana toll roads, 2 ̆ 2] the influence of environmental factors and of advanced sound barrier concepts was investigated. The presence of temperature gradients over pavements was found to have a strong influence on sound propagation. Refraction of sound waves emitted by tire-road interactions {{in the vicinity of the}} ground also affects sound barrier performance. Modified ray tracing model suggested that prevailing winds have an influence on barrier performance at large distances. Randomized edge configurations were found not to improve barrier performance for traffic noise. Random edges simply scatter sound energy without any net noise reduction. Although the edge can be optimized for specific frequency components and locations, it appears that optimization for broadband noise control is difficult. The study also suggested that adding sound absorptive material along the barrier edge could enhance barrier performance. The present study is the continuation of the latter effort to confirm the findings related to the sound absorptive treatment on the barrier through a more rigorous study and to apply the design concept to a realistic situation. A comparison was made between barriers that incorporated sound <b>absorptive</b> treatments and <b>barriers</b> with T-shaped tops. The results confirmed that a sound absorptive treatment near the barrier edge resulted in a performance improvement over corresponding rigid barriers. A design optimization study of the most effective shape of acoustic treatments concluded that a circular shape works best. The performance of two different acoustical materials was also compared. Use of glassfiber resulted in better performance in the high frequency region, while polyolefin foam with closed cells achieved a relatively large insertion loss at low frequencies. Efforts were made to develop a numerical predictive model. The boundary element method was used to model the infinite size surrounding fluid effectively. The disadvantage of the boundary element model is the calculation load associated with the large number of elements required for high frequency analysis. A mesh optimization procedure was successfully implemented in the boundary element model to reduce the calculation time while satisfying the tolerances for analysis accuracy at each analysis frequency. Octave band averaging was also adapted to facilitate the comparison between the numerical results and experimental data. It was found that the results from the boundary element model agree relatively well with the experimental results up to 6300 Hz at selected locations. The insertion loss distribution proved the numerical model 2 ̆ 7 s capability of reproducing the rather complicated interference pattern on the receiver plane correctly at one-third octave band frequencies from 1000 Hz to 6300 Hz. Spatial-averaged insertion losses over different size receiver planes showed that the numerical model was less reliable when the averaging was done close to the ground level. Preliminary measurements for an actual, real-size barrier were performed in South Bend, Indiana, to identify a measurement location that can be used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed add-on device. The add-on device was designed based on laboratory experiments and numerical studies, and was proven to be effective in a realistic highway environment. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Traffic Noise Model (TNM) was exercised for the comparison of the measurements. On-site measurements were performed to evaluate the absorptive treatment. Application of the treatment over a limited (6 m) region improved the performance of the barrier by 2 to 5 dB at the frequencies from 2000 Hz to 5000 Hz...|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) {{such as the}} Internet has enabled the provision of education using these technologies so that academic staff, as well as students, can utilise them. The learning facilitated through these technologies, known as e-Learning, is prevalent in many universities in Australia. Despite the popularity of this model of education, especially in offering flexibility in learning, it appears aspects relating to the transfer of this knowledge are not well understood in academic settings. This, in turn, has introduced {{a number of questions}} as to the creation, generation and retention of knowledge - the main pillars of knowledge management. This study, recognising the domain of knowledge transfer in an academic setting for e-Learning purposes is still in its infancy, has raised two specific questions requiring answers. The first question concerns the use of ICT tools such as email, chat, Internet, bulletin board and WebCT and their role in encouraging transfer of knowledge from an e-Learning environment. The premise of this question was based on there being specific learning management tools, as well as generic tools for learning. It is still unclear how academic knowledge is transferred through these tools and their specific purposes. Hence, {{there is a need to}} understand tool usage in knowledge transfer. It is imperative to understand that the main focus of this study is about understanding transfer of knowledge between academics and not that of academics and students. Certain tools such WebCT or Blackboard (Learning Management tools - LM) rarely play a role in transferring knowledge between academics as it predominantly used for transfer of knowledge between academic and students. However in this study, discussions have been drawn out on LM tools to understand what goes through an academic mind, in terms of sensing the recipient’s <b>absorptive</b> capacity, language <b>barriers,</b> time constraints and inability to sense the recipient emotions. These subtleties are indeed factors both tacit and human behavioural that can play a vital role between any two academics when exchanging knowledge over online. The academic knowledge exchange being envisaged to include global context. It can also be argued that a good proportion of our higher education students are potential academics in training, or professionals who will be interacting with the academics in the future in relation to collaborative and commercial driven research. Thus it was identified that a discussion on LM tools should been included with a view to expand emerging research factors. The second question raised in this study is specific to the behavioural factors influencing exchange of tacit and explicit knowledge in an e-Learning environment. This question is raised in order to understand human behaviour while using the ICT tools during the knowledge transfer process. The two questions collectively attempt to answer the dichotomy of knowledge transfer facilitated through technology and human behaviours. Due to the limited understanding of this domain, this study employed mixed methods research, the first phase using a qualitative methodology. Use of the qualitative technique has enabled the researcher to become a participant observer, facilitated through focus group discussion, in order to better understand the constructs of the study. The summarised data from this phase culminated in the construction of a quantitative survey instrument, specifically prepared for the study. The instrument contained a total of 102 questions, with 75 being dedicated to the themes extracted from the qualitative data, expressed in twelve sections ranging from usage of tools through to motivational factors, such as age. Survey research methodology underpinned this new instrumentation implemented in the second phase, a census method being used to collect data from three different computing departments at Edith Cowan University in order to provide statistical evidence for the identified themes. Using a first order regression model (Exploratory Factor Analysis), the study established there were four specific sets of factors influencing the knowledge transfer process in an academic environment. The first factor, ‘trust’, found that a lack of trust component is present among the respondents of this study, impeding knowledge transfer. The second factor, ‘absorptive capacity’, was found to facilitate knowledge transfer among academics. The third factor ‘motivation’, was found to be lacking in the chosen environment; this was identified as an impediment. The first and the third factors appear to escalate the level of “job insecurity” issues. The last factor, ‘regeneration’, was found to be a combination of technical skills and tacit knowledge; it enabled knowledge transfer through acquisition of relevant technology skills thereby enabling content to be properly transferred to e-Learning platforms. These factors were then grouped into facilitators and impediments, their respective influence being mapped into a conceptual model to show how knowledge transfer was influenced by them. This is the main contribution of this research to the domain of knowledge management. The results of the study enabled recommendations to be made, which were related to the four influencing factor. The first being that tertiary institutions provide more training to their academic staff in the usage of learning management tools as this appears to positively influence knowledge transfer. The second recommendation is to facilitate social interactions among academic colleagues as this setting is where tacit knowledge is effectively transferred. The third recommendation is to develop policies to compensate for the “mentorship” time and effort required to transfer tacit knowledge to junior colleagues. The fourth recommendation is to foster industry experience to academic staff as this experience appears to be enhancing knowledge transfer. The final recommendation is that, as technological skill is essential for the transfer of content knowledge, appropriate procedures should be established to acknowledge these technological skills within academic institutions. The study is limited in the sense that only one institution was chosen for implementation of the research within which, only three computing entities were chosen for data collection. The rationale for this was based on the fact that these academics were familiar with ICT tools enabling the possibility of identifying issues associated with technology in the total knowledge transfer process. Now that this has been accomplished to some extent, future studies should consider a broader sample set in order to further generalise outcomes of the type isolated in this study...|$|R
