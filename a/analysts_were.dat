5|$|Due to a {{combination}} of the venue, Beijing National Aquatics Center (better known as the Water Cube), which was claimed to be built to increase the speed of the swimmers, and the recently introduced LZR Racer swim suits, which had been proven to give the swimmer a lower time by 1.9 to 2.2%, some <b>analysts</b> <b>were</b> predicting that many fast times and world records would be set in all the swimming events.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, when <b>analysts</b> <b>were</b> given {{a tour of}} the Enron Energy Services office, {{they were}} {{impressed}} with how the employees were working so vigorously. In reality, Skilling had moved other employees to the office from other departments (instructing them to pretend to work hard) to create the appearance that the division was larger than it was. This ruse was used several times to fool analysts about the progress of different areas of Enron to help improve the stock price.|$|E

50|$|Securities <b>analysts</b> <b>are</b> usually further {{subdivided}} {{by industry}} specialization (or sectors) -- among the industries {{with the most}} <b>analyst</b> coverage <b>are</b> biotechnology, financial services, energy, and computer hardware, software and services. Fixed income <b>analysts</b> <b>are</b> also often subdivided by asset class—among the fixed income asset classes with the most <b>analyst</b> coverage <b>are</b> convertible bonds, high yield bonds (see high-yield debt), and distressed bonds (see distressed securities). Although technically not securities, syndicated bank loans typically fall within the domain of fixed income <b>analysts,</b> and <b>are</b> covered, {{as if they were}} bonds, by reference to the industry of their borrowers or asset class in which their credit quality would place them.|$|R
5|$|Tamarod and Al Wefaq {{opposition}} society {{praised the}} protests {{and said they}} were successful. The government of Bahrain however said protests did not affect everyday life. The United States said it supported freedom of expression and assembly, and voiced its concern at the chances of violence. <b>Analysts</b> <b>were</b> divided between those who expected protests to be huge and those that did not see them having any chance. They were also divided about the reasons behind the absence of mass protests in Manama, some blaming it on the security forces, others on protest organizers.|$|E
5|$|American <b>analysts</b> <b>were</b> elated {{when they}} {{discovered}} {{that the number of}} trucks ordered by North Vietnam from its communist allies in late 1971 exceeded those of previous years. 6,000 vehicles had been ordered from the Soviet Union alone (as opposed to the usual 3,000) and this seemed to indicate that the enemy was hurting for transportation and that the campaign was working. However, since 80 percent of the vehicles arrived in North Vietnam at least six weeks before the launching of the Nguyen Hue Offensive (known to the U.S. as the Easter Offensive, they probably reflected anticipated losses.|$|E
5|$|American {{intelligence}} <b>analysts</b> <b>were</b> quite {{baffled by}} {{this series of}} enemy actions. For them {{there appeared to be}} no logic behind the sustained NVA/NLF offensives, other than to inflict casualties on the allied forces. This they accomplished, but the casualties absorbed by the North Vietnamese seemed to negate any direct gains they might have obtained. The border battles did, however, have two significant consequences that were unappreciated at the time—they fixed the attention of the American command on the border regions and they drew American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities, in preparation for the Tet Offensive.|$|E

5|$|During the 2014 off-season, Olshey signed center Chris Kaman and two-time former Blazer guard Steve Blake {{to bolster}} the bench. Expectations by sportswriters and <b>analysts</b> <b>were</b> high for the Trail Blazers going into the 2015 NBA season given their {{surprise}} success in 2013–14. The Blazers beat the reigning Northwest Division Champion Oklahoma City Thunder, 106–89, in their season opener at home on October 29, 2014. Like the season before, the Trail Blazers dominated the month of November, at one point winning nine straight games from November 9 to November 26 before being defeated by the Memphis Grizzlies. Injuries, which had not been significant the previous season, started to inflict themselves on various players. Starting center Lopez fractured his right hand {{in a game against}} the Spurs on December 15, 2014, and missed the next 23 games. Initially, the Blazers were much unfazed, winning 129–119 in triple overtime against the Spurs on December 19, a game that saw Lillard and Aldridge combine for 75 points on 29 field goals; Lillard netted a career-high 43 points. Four days later, Lillard hit a three-pointer to tie the game and force overtime against the Thunder en route to 40 points and a 115–111 victory. Three Blazers went to New Orleans for the All Star Weekend: Matthews for the Foot Locker Three-Point Contest, Lillard as a reserve to the All-Star Game, and Aldridge as a starter to the All-Star game.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} {{although}} forecasts of independent <b>analysts</b> <b>are</b> less accurate ex post, they yield forecast errors {{that are more}} strongly associated with abnormal stock returns. This suggests that forecasts of independent <b>analysts</b> <b>are</b> superior to those of nonindependent analysts in representing ex ante market expectations. We also show that forecasts of nonindependent analysts become more accurate and less biased, and produce forecast errors more strongly associated with abnormal stock returns when independent <b>analysts</b> <b>are</b> following the same firms than when they are not. This suggests {{that the presence of}} independent analysts disciplines the behavior of nonindependent analysts. ...|$|R

25|$|Dell had a {{reputation}} as a company that relied upon its supply chain efficiency to sell established products at low prices, instead of being an innovator. By the mid-2000s many <b>analysts</b> <b>were</b> looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector. Dell's relatively low spending on research and development as a percentage of its sales prevented it from developing products in more lucrative segments, such as MP3 players and mobile devices.

25|$|In mid-1998, {{the company}} made its first sales, earning just $809,000 over three months, and investors started pushing for an initial public {{offering}} (IPO).

Despite having $6 million in annual losses, the stock price rose from $24 a share to $126 in the first day of trading and $161 by October 2000. At the time, <b>analysts</b> <b>were</b> expecting a large market for caching appliances, due to widespread frustration with internet speeds.|$|E
25|$|Political <b>analysts</b> <b>were</b> {{optimistic about}} the selection.

Sharmarke was considered someone who could potentially bridge the gap between the various groups currently competing for influence in Somalia, as he was based abroad and thus not tied to local politics. Sharmarke's appointment was also seen by some analysts as an attempt to secure the favor of the large Darod clan, whose Majeerteen branch both Sharmarke and the outgoing President of Somalia, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, are members of.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{underwear}} maker Jockey International {{offered a}} new way to measure bra and cup size. It introduced a system with ten cup sizes per band size that are numbered and not lettered, designated as 1-36, 2-36 etc. The company developed the system over eight years, during which they scanned and measured the breasts and torsos of 800 women. Researchers also tracked the women's use of their bras at home. To implement the system, women must purchase a set of plastic cups from the company to find their Jockey cup size. Some <b>analysts</b> <b>were</b> critical of the requirement to buy the measurement kit, since women must pay about USD$20 to adopt Jockey's proprietary system, in addition to the cost of the bras themselves.|$|E
40|$|I {{examine whether}} {{management}} provides pessimistic earnings forecasts to guide analysts into walking down their estimates.

Results show that <b>analysts</b> <b>are</b> less likely to support management by walking down their estimates and management {{is less likely to}} issue pessimistic forecasts for annual earnings forecasts. Furthermore, <b>analysts</b> <b>are</b> likely to walk down their estimates if they are more optimistic before the management forecasts. <b>Analysts</b> <b>are</b> likely to support management by lowering their estimates if management issues a pessimistic forecast. I find that after Regulation Fair Disclosure, management is less likely to issue pessimistic annual earnings forecasts, and in the mean time, <b>analysts</b> <b>are</b> less likely to walk down their estimates to support management. However, I do not find support that firms with high litigation risk or loss firms are more likely to provide pessimistic forecasts. ...|$|R
