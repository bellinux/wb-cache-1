50|$|Turntables called record changers {{could play}} records stacked {{vertically}} on a spindle. This arrangement encouraged {{the production of}} multiple-record sets in automatic sequence. A two-record set had Side 1 and Side 4 on one record, and Side 2 and Side 3 on the other, so the first two sides could play in a changer without the listener's intervention. Then the stack was flipped over. Larger boxed sets used appropriate <b>automatic</b> <b>sequencing</b> (1-8, 2-7, 3-6, 4-5) to allow continuous playback, but this created difficulties when searching for an individual track.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Streams are omnipresent in both {{mathematics}} and theoretical computer science. <b>Automatic</b> <b>sequences</b> form a particularly interesting class of streams {{that live in}} both worlds at the same time: they are {{defined in terms of}} finite automata, which are basic computational structures in computer science; and they appear in mathematics in many different ways, for instance in number theory. Examples of <b>automatic</b> <b>sequences</b> include the celebrated Thue-Morse sequence and the Rudin-Shapiro sequence. In this paper, we apply the coalgebraic perspective on streams to <b>automatic</b> <b>sequences.</b> We show that the set of <b>automatic</b> <b>sequences</b> carries a final coalgebra structure, consisting of the operations of head, even, and odd. This will allow us to show that <b>automatic</b> <b>sequences</b> are to (general) streams what rational languages are to (arbitrary) languages. ...|$|R

Furthermore, we can show a Prime Number Theorem for <b>automatic</b> <b>sequences</b> that are generated by strongly connected automata where the initial state is fixed by the transition corresponding to 0.

40|$|We study {{correlation}} {{estimates of}} <b>automatic</b> <b>sequences</b> (that is, sequences computable by finite automata) with polynomial phases. As a consequence, we provide {{a new class}} of good weights for classical and polynomial ergodic theorems, not coming themselves from dynamical systems. We show that <b>automatic</b> <b>sequences</b> are good weights in $L^ 2 $ for polynomial averages and totally ergodic systems. For totally balanced <b>automatic</b> <b>sequences</b> (i. e., sequences converging to zero in mean along arithmetic progressions) the pointwise weighted ergodic theorem in $L^ 1 $ holds. Moreover, invertible <b>automatic</b> <b>sequences</b> are good weights for the pointwise polynomial ergodic theorem in $L^r$, $r> 1 $. Comment: 28 page...|$|R
50|$|Bowyangs {{are also}} the straps that pilots, and other flight-crew, wear just below the knee that connects to their ejection-seat {{mechanism}} {{in such a way}} that the seat's ejection stroke hauls both legs back against the seat (to clear the instrument panel above) and restrains them from flailing about in the slipstream before the seat is slowed and steadied. The attachment is released as the pilot is released from the seat during its <b>automatic</b> <b>sequencing.</b> This colloquial use of bowyangs was started in the Royal New Zealand Air Force and spread, via the seat-manufacturer, to other air forces.|$|E
50|$|Longer programs, which {{required}} several disc sides, pioneered {{the system of}} recording odd-numbered sides inside-out and even-numbered sides outside-in so that the sound quality would match {{from the end of}} one side {{to the start of the}} next. Although a pair of turntables was used, to avoid any pauses for disc-flipping, the sides had to be pressed in a hybrid of manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>sequencing,</b> arranged in such a manner that no disc being played had to be turned over to play the next side in the sequence. Instead of a three-disc set having the 1-2, 3-4 and 5-6 manual sequence, or the 1-6, 2-5 and 3-4 automatic sequence for use with a drop-type mechanical record changer, broadcast sequence would couple the sides as 1-4, 2-5 and 3-6.|$|E
5000|$|Improvements to {{the design}} of the Intruder, to produce a Series II model, were made in time for it to be {{exhibited}} at the October 1951 Dairy Show. It still carried a payload of 25 cwt, but the chassis was of all-welded construction, with the side beams parallel to each other. This enabled the springs to be mounted so that they were parallel to each other, which improved the suspension and the ride quality. The battery system was upgraded from 60 volts to 72 volts by including an exta six cells, and was moved {{from the middle of the}} vehicle to two panniers of 18 cells each, which were mounted outside the main frame. They supplied a [...] motor through the control panel, which was now accessible from the cab, rather than through a removable panel. A total of five contactors with <b>automatic</b> <b>sequencing</b> gave four forward or reverse speeds, and the direction of travel selected was indicated by red and green lights on the dashboard.
