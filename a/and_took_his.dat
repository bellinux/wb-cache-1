5|$|After the 1836 election, Tyler {{thought his}} {{political}} career was at an end, and planned to return to private law practice. In the fall of 1837 a friend sold him a sizable property in Williamsburg. Unable to remain away from politics, Tyler successfully sought election to the House of Delegates <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> seat in 1838. He was a national political figure by this point, and his third delegate service touched on such national issues as the sale of public lands.|$|E

5|$|In {{early spring}} AD 15, Germanicus crossed the Rhine and struck the Chatti. He sacked their capital Mattium (modern Maden near Gudensberg), pillaged their countryside, then {{returned}} to the Rhine. Sometime this year, he received word from Segestes, who was held prisoner by Arminius' forces and needed help. Germanicus' troops released Segestes <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> pregnant daughter, Arminius' wife Thusnelda, into captivity.

5|$|Barbarian King Alrik– The former {{ruler of}} {{a horde of}} barbarians. As the {{champion}} of Hades, he sought the Ambrosia to save his ailing father. Alrik was ultimately unsuccessful and was killed by Kratos. Resurrected by Hades, Prince Alrik learned that he had become King {{after the death of}} his father. Alrik sought vengeance against Kratos, and his barbarian horde threatened to overwhelm Kratos' opposing Spartan army. Alrik almost killed Kratos in combat, but this was undone at the critical moment when Kratos offered up his life to Ares and was returned to battle equipped with the Blades of Chaos, which Kratos used to decapitate Alrik. Alrik eventually fought his way out of the Underworld, and intent on revenge, found and confronted Kratos on the Island of Creation. Kratos killed the Barbarian King once again, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> hammer. The character was voiced by Bob Joles in God of War II, and Fred Tatasciore in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E

5|$|Benaud {{returned}} for the Third Test, when England levelled the series despite twin half-centuries of 73 and 53 from Harvey, who top-scored in both innings on a dustbowl in a match that lasted only three days. Harvey {{failed to pass}} 35 {{in the last two}} Tests, and ended with 338 runs at 42.25, and was a significant factor in Australia's eventual 2–1 victory. In {{the second half of the}} tour, Harvey added centuries against Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> career best bowling fugres of 4/8 against Middlesex to help set up a ten-wicket win. He ended his final tour for Australia with 1452 runs at 44.00 with five centuries. During the season, Harvey and Benaud led aggressively to force a result through attacking strategy and a determination to avoid time-wasting.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick did {{not believe}} that there was any {{likelihood}} of another war with Germany in 1939, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of the outbreak of the Second World War therefore came as a shock. Determined not to spend another war in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to Stockholm as fast as he could, but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a tramp steamer. When he reached Liverpool, Chadwick found Joseph Rotblat, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.|$|E
5|$|During {{the presidential}} {{referendum}} in Egypt, Nasser was re-elected {{to a second}} term as UAR president <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> oath on 25 March 1965. He was the only candidate for the position, with virtually all of his political opponents forbidden by law from running for office, and his fellow party members reduced to mere followers. That same year, Nasser had the Muslim Brotherhood chief ideologue Sayyed Qutb imprisoned. Qutb was charged and found guilty by the court of plotting to assassinate Nasser, and was executed in 1966. Beginning in 1966, as Egypt's economy slowed and government debt became increasingly burdensome, Nasser began to ease state control over the private sector, encouraging state-owned bank loans to private business and introducing incentives to increase exports. During the 60's, the Egyptian economy went from sluggishness to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser's appeal waned considerably.|$|E

5|$|Hermes– The former God of Speed and Commerce, the Messenger of the Gods, and {{the father}} of Ceryx. Hermes participated in the Olympian wager in the God of War comic series by {{choosing}} Danaus to be his champion. In God of War III, Hermes taunted Kratos about murdering his family during Kratos' assault on Mount Olympus, leading to a chase through the city of Olympia. Kratos eventually caught Hermes off guard, killed him, which released a plague on the world, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> boots, the Boots of Hermes, as his own. The character was voiced by Greg Ellis in God of War III.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{controversy}} {{arose in}} the NP when lawyer Olaf Madsen– who had cooperated with Ola Thommessen for more than 20 years at the newspaper Verdens Gang and was responsible for its economic decisions– wanted to have more dividend for his investments in the newspaper. Editor Ola Thommessen considered this to be an inappropriate intervention in the editorial part of the newspaper, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> staff with him and started a new newspaper named Tidens Tegn. Vogt supported Thommessen in his decision, and came {{at odds with the}} chairman of Morgenbladets board, lawyer and politician Edmund Harbitz. Both left Morgenbladet in the summer of 1913 {{as a result of the}} disaccord, although Vogt continued as theatre and literature critic in the paper until his 1927 death. As editor, Vogt was succeeded by C. J. Hambro.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Lu left Sidley Austin <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> {{first job}} in the {{political}} arena as deputy chief counsel for Representative Henry Waxman and the Democratic staff of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee of the House of Representatives. Phil Schiliro, Waxman's chief of staff, had a large part in the decision to hire Lu; the two would work together again later on the Obama administration; Lu later said he considers Schiliro and Pete Rouse, another future White House staffer, among his most influential mentors. During his tenure with the Government Reform Committee, Lu conducted several high-profile investigations, including investigations into campaign fundraising during the 1996 presidential election, the collapse of Enron, and substandard nursing home conditions. Lu also served as special adviser for communications to Senator John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. One of his primary duties there was coordinating the activities of families of September 11 attack victims supporting the Kerry campaign.|$|E

5|$|In February 1761 Blackstone was {{considered}} as a potential Tory candidate for the rotten borough of Hindon in Wiltshire. After consultation with friends, he agreed to this prospect – {{at the same time}} refusing the offer of appointment as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. On 30 March 1761 he was returned for Hindon, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> seat. This did not limit his legal work, initially, with the seat being given without a requirement to attend or vote in a particular way, and the grant of a patent of precedence at the same time actually increased the demand on his time. Court records show him pleading before Lord Mansfield in the Court of King's Bench soon after his election, and acting as counsel in Tonson v Collins, a copyright case, Thiquet v Bath, an important case on international law, and R v d'Eon, acting for the prosecution in a feud over Louis XV's newly appointed cross-dressing Ambassador to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In India, Harvey scored 114 out of Australia's 468 in the First Test at Delhi, {{setting up}} an innings victory for Australia. On a pitch conducive to spin at Kanpur for the second Test, Harvey was given a rare {{opportunity}} to bowl and he took the wicket of the Indian captain, Gulabrai Ramchand. In addition, he scored 51 and 25, the second highest Australian score in each innings in a low-scoring match, but India won to square the series, with off spinner Jasu Patel taking 14/124. Harvey hit 102 in a drawn third Test in Bombay <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> third (and final) Test wicket, A. G. Milkha Singh, in the fourth Test at Madras. He ended the series with 356 runs at 50.86, a significant contribution to Australia's 2–1 triumph.|$|E
5|$|Manuel's {{death on}} 24 September 1180 left his 11-year-old son Alexios II Komnenos on the throne. Alexios was highly incompetent at the office, {{but it was}} his mother, Maria of Antioch, and her Frankish {{background}} that made his regency unpopular. Eventually, Andronikos I Komnenos, a grandson of Alexios I, launched a revolt against his younger relative and managed to overthrow him in a violent coup d'état. Utilizing his good looks and his immense popularity with the army, he marched on to Constantinople in August 1182 and incited a massacre of the Latins. After eliminating his potential rivals, he had himself crowned as co-emperor in September 1183. He eliminated Alexios II, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> 12-year-old wife Agnes of France for himself.|$|E
