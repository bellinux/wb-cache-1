An amateur's drawing, or a workman's drawing--anybody's drawing but an artist's, is always valueless in itself. It may be, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> Mr. Redgrave tell <b>you,</b> most precious <b>as</b> a memorial, or as a gift, or as a means of noting useful facts; but as Art, an amateur's drawing is always wholly worthless; and it ought to be one of our great objects to make the pupil understand and feel that, and prevent his trying to make his valueless work look, in some superficial, hypocritical, eye-catching, penny-catching way, like work that is really good.|$|R

40|$|Prime Minister, Peter Medgyessy, {{took the}} stage in his Socialist Party {{headquarters}} to informally accept {{the mandate of the}} electorate. Announcing his intention to form a liberal-socialist coalition government, Medgyessy told his listeners that he would be the prime minister for all 10 million Hungarians. A few moments later the defeated, Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, {{in the course of his}} resignation speech, had this to say about his outgoing conservative government: “We have supported Hungarian culture to a degree not yet seen and we have begun the process of national reunification, so it is not <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>just</b> now from the seat of another party, it is not that the future of Hungary lies in the 10 million Hungarians but in the 15 million Hungarian nation.

60|$|But {{all this}} time I have only got you into the outer salon of a French hotel. In order that we may proceed more regularly, we {{will return to the}} dinner given by our {{minister}} to Mr. Canning. Mr. Brown has an apartment in the Hotel Monaco, one of the best houses in Paris. The Prince of Monaco is the sovereign of a little territory of the same name, on the Gulf of Nice, {{at the foot of the}} maritime Alps. His states may be some six or eight miles square, and the population some six or eight thousand. The ancient name of the family is Grimaldi; but by some intermarriage or other, the Duke of Valentinois, a Frenchman, has become the prince. This little state is still independent, though under the especial protection of the King of Sardinia, and without foreign relations. It was formerly a common thing for the petty princes of Europe to own hotels at Paris. Thus the present Hotel of the Legion of Honour was built by a Prince of Salms; and the Princes of Monaco had two, one of which is occupied by the Austrian ambassador, and, in the other, our own minister, just at this moment, has an apartment. As I had been pressed especially to be early, I went a little before six, and finding no one in the drawing-room, I strolled into the bureau, where I found Mr. Shelden, the secretary of legation, who lived in the family, dressed for dinner. We chatted a little, and, on my admiring the magnificence of the rooms, he gave me the history of the hotel, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> it, with an additional anecdote, that may be worth relating.|$|R
6000|$|... "The law of Scotland," [...] he went on, [...] "so far as {{it relates}} to Irregular Marriages, is an outrage on common decency and common-sense. If you think my {{language}} in thus describing it too strong--I can refer you to the language of a judicial authority. Lord Deas delivered a recent judgment of marriage in Scotland, from the bench, in these words: 'Consent makes marriage. No form or ceremony, civil or religious; no notice before, or publication after; no cohabitation, no writing, no witnesses even, are essential to the constitution of this, the most important contract which two persons can enter into.'--There is a Scotch judge's own statement of the law that he administers! Observe, at the same time, if you please, that we make full legal provision in Scotland for contracts affecting the sale of houses and lands, horses and dogs. The only contract which we leave without safeguards or precautions of any sort is the contract that unites {{a man and a woman}} for life. As for the authority of parents, and the innocence of children, our law recognizes no claim on it either in the one case or in the other. A girl of twelve and a boy of fourteen have nothing to do but to cross the Border, and to be married--without the interposition of the slightest delay or restraint, and without the slightest attempt to inform their parents on the part of the Scotch law. As to the marriages of men and women, even the mere interchange of consent which, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>just</b> <b>heard,</b> makes them man and wife, is not required to be directly proved: it may be proved by inference. And, more even than that, whatever the law for its consistency may presume, men and women are, in point of fact, held to be married in Scotland where consent has never been interchanged, and where the parties do not even know that they are legally held to be married persons. Are you sufficiently confused about the law of Irregular Marriages in Scotland by this time, Mr. Delamayn? And have I said enough to justify the strong language I used when I undertook to describe it to you?" ...|$|R

40|$|Sounds of idling Diesel engines {{were rated}} {{according}} to their Dieselness with two different psychoacoustic methods. On the one hand, a yes/no procedure was used. Subjects were presented sounds of 1 500 ms duration and had to answer by “yes ” or “no ” to the following question: “Does the sound which <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> stem from a Diesel engine? ” Histograms were calculated and a hypothesis was put forward as follows: The more positive answers are given to a specific sound, the larger is the Dieselness of this sound. On the other hand, the method of paired comparison was used, applying a Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) procedure. Both procedures yield rather similar results with an advantage of the yes/no-procedure in efficiency. Comparisons of psychoacoustic evaluations with predictions of Dieselness by four different algorithms show much room for improvement of the instrumental evaluations. ...|$|R
