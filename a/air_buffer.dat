On the base of obtained mathematical model the algorithm of calculation of optimum parameters of transporting systems with discretely powered gas buffer is developed.

Further support for this assumption is presented here with the result of studies of suspensions of washed cells of this meningococcus in the presence of either maltose, glucose, glucose-i-phosphate, or a polysaccharide from a type 1 meningococcus. These systems were explored with respect to rates of oxygen consumption in carbon dioxide-free air and in <b>air</b> <b>buffered</b> with three per cent carbon dioxide, aerobic and anaerobic acid production, and uptake of inorganic phosphate.

The duration of dry matter accumulation decreases with temperature, resulting in a decrease of final seed dry weight. In this study we test the hypothesis that a diffusion barrier for O 2, located in the seed coat, inhibits seed respiration and growth. The rate of O 2 uptake of intact seeds and of excised embryos and seed coats (separated seeds) was measured in <b>air</b> and <b>buffer</b> at 16, 20, and/or 26 °C at various O 2 concentrations and developmental stages. Oxygen uptake rates of intact seeds in buffer were only 9 to 15 % of those in <b>air.</b> In <b>buffer,</b> the respiration rate of intact seeds decreased at a pO 2 below air saturation (21 kilopascals), whereas separated seeds showed a decline of O 2 uptake only below 80 % of air saturation.

40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the pressure-gain {{combustion}} engine are investigated analytically and experimentally in the current study. A lumped parameter model is developed to characterize the operation of a valveless pulse detonation engine. The model identified the function of flame quenching process through gas dynamic process. By adjusting fuel manifold pressure and geometries, {{the duration of the}} <b>air</b> <b>buffer</b> can be effectively varied. The parametric study with the lumped parameter model has shown that engine frequency of up to approximately 15 Hz is attainable. However, requirements for upstream air pressure increases significantly with higher engine frequency. The higher pressure requirement indicates pressure loss in the system and lower overall engine performance. ^ The loss of performance due to the pressure loss is a critical issue for the integrated pressure-gain combustors. Two types of transitional methods are examined using entropy-based models. An accumulator based transition has obvious loss due to sudden area expansion, but it can be minimized by utilizing the gas dynamics in the combustion tube. An ejector type transition has potential to achieve performance beyond the limit specified by a single flow path Humphrey cycle. The performance of an ejector was discussed in terms of apparent entropy and mixed flow entropy. Through an ideal ejector, the apparent part of entropy increases due to the reduction in flow unsteadiness, but entropy of the mixed flow remains constant. The method is applied to a CFD simulation with a simple manifold for qualitative evaluation. ^ The operation of the wave rotor constant volume combustion rig is experimentally examined. The rig has shown versatility of operation for wide range of conditions. Large pressure rise in the rotor channel and in a section of the exhaust duct are observed even with relatively large leakage gaps on the rotor. The simplified analysis indicated that inconsistent combustion is likely due to insufficient fuel near the ignition source. However, it is difficult to conclude its fuel distribution with the current setup. Additional measurement near the rotor interfaces and better fuel control are required for the future test. ...|$|E

Weld and base metal coupons were evaluated in <b>air</b> and <b>buffered</b> saline solution to produce S-N fatigue curves. When tested in air, both welds and base metal demonstrated a fatigue limit, with the weld failing in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) at a reduced fatigue life. In saline solution at low cycle-high stress, there was a notable reduction in fatigue life attributed to crack initiation at corrosion pits. At high cycle-low stress, failure of welds shifted to the base metal where there was severe corrosive attack and reduced load bearing cross-section. Controlled immersion tests confirmed this shift in attack from the HAZ and weld metal to the base metal at long times. Although polarization curve measurements showed the weld metal {{to be the most}} reactive (i. e. more negative corrosion potential), the gradual formation of a stable passive fi lm eventually protect s the weld metal and HAZ from further attack. By alloying more Al in the anodic weld metal (e. g. increasing AZ 61 filler dilution), its corrosion potential is shifted closer to that of the base metal and corrosive attack is minimized.

The Block II design is capable of both electron ionization and chemical ionization. Ethanol is being used as the Cl reagent based on a study indicating best performance for the Biological Warfare (BW) detection task (31). Data showing good signal to noise for 500 pg of methyl salicylate injected into the CW Air inlet, 50 ng of dimethylmethylphosphonate exposed to the CW Ground probe and 5 ng of methyl stearate analyzed using the pyrolyzer inlet were presented. Biological agents are sampled using a ''bio-concentrator'' unit that is designed to concentrate particles in the low micron range.

Microwaves are electromagnetic waves with frequencies ranging between 300 MHz (300 x 106 Hz) and 300 GHz (300 x 109 Hz) and wavelengths from 1 m to 1 mm[1]. They are waves that lie within the region between TV waves and the infrared region within the spectrum of electromagnetic waves. According to the Technical Standards Textbook for Homeopathic Pharmacy, glass tubes may be reused after washed with running and purified water and inactivated by autoclaving at 120 oC for 30 minutes or by a dry <b>air</b> <b>buffer</b> at 180 oC for 30 minutes or at 140 oC for 1 hour [2]. &# 13; &# 13; Aims: Current experiment evaluates the influence of ultra-diluted Sulphur with and without inactivation by autoclaving and microwaving for certain variables in the germination and growth of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench - cv TX 623 B). &# 13; &# 13; Methodology: Ten milliliters of Sulphur in homeopathic dinamizations (proposed by Hering - DH) 9 DH, 18 DH and 30 DH inactivated by microwave and by autoclave heat, and control with water, were added to petri dishes in which 20 sorghum seeds were distributed. The experiment was conducted in a growth chamber (BOD) at 25 oC and during a 16 -h photoperiod. Double-blind methodology to avoid researcherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible interferences or trends, coupled to statistic treatment {{at the end of}} the experiment, was employed. Data underwent variance analysis and means were compared by Scott-KnottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s test at 5 % probability. &# 13; &# 13; Results: Homeopathy Sulphur changed the evaluated parameters of 9 DH, 18 DH and 30 DH dinamizations when compared to control (water). Differences existed with regard to effects of the different microwave-treated (M 9 DH, M 18 DH, M 30 DH) and autoclaving-treated (A 9 DH, A 18 DH, A 30 DH) dinamizations. Sulphur had no significant difference in the aerial length (CPA) when compared with that of control. In the case of the same homeopathic treatments previously undergoing autoclaving, the three dinamizations had a similar response to CPA. The same occurred with drugs submitted to microwaves. With regard to rootÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s growth (CSR), treatment with Sulphur inhibited growth in the dinamizations 18 DH and 30 DH when compared to control. This did not occur with 9 DH which had the same effect as that of water. In the case of groups treated with medicines 30 DH and 9 DH undergoing microwaves, the same effect of water was reported. Consequently, microwaves inactivated the effect of homeopathic medicine. However, in 18 DH under the effect of microwaves, the effect of drug 18 DH was reported. Consequently, there was growth inhibition but no inactivation by microwaves. In the case of groups treated with autoclaved medicine, a greater root growth was reported. This fact shows that autoclaving altered the homeopathic medicine. In fact, it had an opposite effect when compared to control. On the other hand, when Fresh Root Weight was evaluated, differences in control were reported only for groups treated with autoclaved medicines. These results were similar to those of the group treated with medicine 18 DH. An increase in the fresh root weight was reported agreeing with a greater root growth. Results related to the aerial part and to the root of the dry mass failed to show any significant difference among the groups. &# 13; &# 13; Conclusions: Results show that different physiological responses are produced posterior to the employment of homeopathic medicine, sometimes stimulating, sometimes inhibiting root growth. The aerial part was not influenced by any treatment. On the other hand, autoclaved medicines stimulated root growth[3] [4]. This fact shows changes in the homeopathic medicine under humid heat. Microwave treatments showed an inactivation for 9 DH and 30 DH, but not for 18 DH. The latter had the same results as those treated with Sulphur 18 DH. The above results suggest that microwaves may inactivate homeopathic medicines, albeit not entirely. Therefore, it may not be a reliable inactivation methodology...|$|E

Compared to a control panel, walnut shell additions showed an improved ability to remove VOCs and formaldehyde from the indoor <b>air</b> and <b>buffer</b> humidity. Of particular significance was the irreversible sink effect of formaldehyde and dodecane. This was attributed to the porous surface of walnut shell increasing the specific surface area of the panel and thus its adsorption capacity. The improved capacity of buffer humidity also increased the ability to adsorb water soluble VOCs such as formaldehyde. This research provides for the first time significant evidence that walnut shell modified MDF can improve indoor air quality...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aims were to {{test and}} {{evaluate}} two novel and independent histochemical methods for detecting the initial postischemic burst of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in buffer perfused rat tissues during reflow after 60 min warm ischemia. Methods: The {{first is a}} high manganese/diaminobenzidine technique, in which superoxide oxidises Mn 2 + to Mn 3 +, which in turn oxidizes diaminobenzidine to form amber colored polymers, observable by light microscopy. The second is a high iron/diaminobenzidine technique, in which hydrogen peroxide oxidizes diethylenetriaminepenta-acetate chelated Fe 2 + to form intermediate species, which in turn oxidize diaminobenzidine similarly to Mn 3 +. Various isolated organs of the rat were rendered ischemic for 60 min, and reperfused with oxygen or <b>air</b> equilibrated <b>buffers</b> containing diaminobenzidine and either Mn 2 + or Fe 2 +. Tissues were fixed by perfusion with Trump’s solution and processed for light microscopy. Results: Both manganese and iron methods consistently showed the appearance of reaction product on the luminal surfaces of arterial, capillary, and venular endothelial cells in lung, heart, and intestine of the rat during the first 2 to 3 min of reoxygenation after ischemia. The histochemical reactions were nearly absent in non-manganese treated and non-iron-treated controls. Superoxide dismutase strongly inhibited Mn 2 +/diaminobenzidine reaction product formation and catalase strongly inhibited Fe 2 +/diaminobenzidine reaction product formation, when tested in specially perfused lung preparations in which these specific antioxidant enzymes were concentrated. Conclusions: These histochemical techniques provide direct, visual evidence that a burst of reactive oxygen species is generated in postischemic rat tissues. The Mn 2 +/diaminobenzidine and Fe 2 +/diaminobenzidine techniques permit investigation of the endothelium derived reactive oxygen by simple laboratory procedures available to almost any investigator at low marginal cost. The endothelial oxidants so revealed may be of pathophysiological significance {{in a variety of}} cardiovascular disorders...|$|R
40|$|Our {{long-term}} {{goal is to}} establish an improved understanding {{of the factors that}} control the marine aerosol properties and concentrations as they relate to generation processes, mixing processes, their dependence on oceanic and environmental conditions and physicochemical evolution in the marine boundary layer. We expect these efforts to lead to improved modeling and predictability of marine aerosol concentrations and optical properties. OBJECTIVES Our recent ONR efforts characterized sea-salt aerosol (SSA) size distributions and production from breaking waves through measurements under accelerating wind conditions in the “natural wind tunnels ” between Hawaiian Islands. These experiments revealed the typical presence of Large Organized Structures (LOS) or rolls aligned along the wind in the channels both with and without visible cloud streets. This organized mixing process can include entrainment of <b>air</b> to/from the <b>buffer</b> layer (BuL), the free troposphere (FT) and the mixed boundary layer (BL) that can directly influence aerosol concentrations, fluxes and visibility. Our activities this past year include analysis of tugboat and aircraft data as part of preparation of our paper investigating these LOS including their role in aerosol processes and the vertical mixing of sea-salt and associated optical extinction...|$|R
40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{is widely}} used to measure morphological and mechanical properties of biological materials at the nanoscale. AFM is able to visualize and measure these properties in different environmental conditions. However, these conditions can influence the results considerably, rendering their interpretation {{a matter of some}} subtlety. We demonstrate this by imaging ~ 10 nm diameter α-synuclein amyloid fibrils, focusing specifically on the structure of the C-terminal part of the protein monomers incorporated into fibrils. Despite these influences leading to variations in fibril heights, we have shown that by maintaining careful control of AFM settings we can quantitatively compare the morphological parameters of fibrils imaged in <b>air</b> or in <b>buffer</b> conditions. From this comparison we were able to deduce the semiflexible character of this C-terminal region. Fibril height differences measured in air and liquid indicate that the C-terminal region collapses onto the fibril core upon drying. The fibril heights decrease upon increasing ion concentration in solution, suggesting that the C-terminal tails collapse into more compact structures as a result of charge screening. Finally, PeakForce QNM measurements show an apparent heterogeneity of C-terminal packing along the fibril length...|$|R

The bioanode consists of GOx enzyme and PQQ redox mediator adsorbed over night on MWCNTs then deposited {{by means of}} AC-electrophoresis at 30 ?Hz and 160 ?Vpp and, finally stabilized by electropolymerized polypyrrole. The biocathode is constructed from LAc enzyme and ABTS redox mediator adsorbed over night on MWCNTs, then electrophoretically deposited under AC-electric field at 30 ?Hz and 160 ?Vpp and, finally stabilized by electrodeposited polypyrrole. The BFC was studied under <b>air</b> in phosphate <b>buffer</b> solution pH 7. 4 containing 10 ?mM glucose and in human serum with 5 ?mM glucose addition at the physiological temperature of 37 degrees C. Under these conditions, the maximum power density reaches 1. 1 mu W center dot mm- 2 at a cell voltage of 0. 167 ?V in buffer solution and 0. 69 mu W center dot mm- 2 at cell voltage of 0. 151 ?V in human serum. Such automated BFCs have a great potential to be optimized, miniaturized to micro and nanoscale devices suitable for in vivo studies. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012; 109 : 16011609.

40|$|The neutron {{reflectivity}} {{technique is}} applied to determine the adsorptive interaction of the 13. 5 -kDa actin-binding protein hisactophilin from Dictyostelium discoideum with lipid monolayers at a lateral pressure of 21 mN/m < or = pi < or = 25 mN/m at the air-water interface. We compare binding of natural hisactophilin exhibiting a myristic acid chain membrane anchor at the N-terminus (DIC-HIS) and a fatty acid-deficient genetic product expressed in Escherichia coli (EC-HIS). It is demonstrated that only the natural hisactophilin DIC-HIS is capable of mediating the strong binding of monomeric actin to the monolayer, where it forms a layer of about 40 A thickness corresponding to the average diameter of actin monomers. Monolayers composed of pure dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine with fully deuterated hydrocarbon tails and headgroup (DMPC-d 67) and 1 : 1 mixtures of this lipid with chain deuterated dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG-d 54) are studied on subphases consisting either of fully deuterated buffer (D 2 O) or of a 9 : 1 H 2 O/D 2 O buffer that matches the scattering length density of <b>air</b> (CMA <b>buffer).</b> The reflectivity data are analyzed in terms of layer models, consisting of one to three layers, depending on the contrast of the buffer and the system. We show that both protein species bind tightly to negatively charged 1 : 1 DMPC-d 67 /DMPG-d 54 monolayers, thereby forming a thin and most probably monomolecular protein layer of 12 - 15 A thickness. We find that the natural protein (DIC-HIS) partially penetrates into the lipid monolayer, in contrast to chain-deficient species (EC-HIS), which forms only an adsorbed layer. The coverage of the monolayer with DIC-HIS strongly depends {{on the presence of}} anionic DMPG in the monolayer. At a bulk protein concentration of 1. 5 micrograms/ml, the molar ratio of bound protein to lipid is about 1 : 45 for the 1 : 1 lipid mixture but only 1 : 420 for the pure DMPC...|$|R
