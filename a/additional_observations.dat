5|$|Gravitational-wave {{astronomy}} is {{an emerging}} field of astronomy that employs gravitational-wave detectors to collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, {{such as the}} Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory LIGO. LIGO made its first detection on 14 September 2015, observing gravitational waves from a binary black hole. A second gravitational wave was detected on 26 December 2015 and <b>additional</b> <b>observations</b> should continue but gravitational waves require extremely sensitive instruments.|$|E
5|$|N2K {{deliberately}} biased {{its search}} towards closely orbiting Jupiter-size planets (Hot Jupiters) in {{the orbit of}} metal-rich stars, as the consortium hoped to discover how the mass of a planet relates to its host star's metal content. Initially, HD 154672 was noted as a host to a short-orbit Hot Jupiter, although <b>additional</b> <b>observations</b> revealed that the prospective planetary body had a longer orbit than previously expected, as revealed by the Magellan Telescopes at Chile's Las Campanas Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-6b {{is a hot}} Jupiter, {{having a}} mass 0.669 times that of Jupiter, but an average {{distance}} of only 0.046 AU from its star and, thus, an orbital period of 3.23 days. It is almost 10 times closer to its star than Mercury is from our Sun. As a result, Kepler-6b is strongly irradiated by its star, heating its atmosphere to a temperature of 1660 K and puffing {{it up to a}} size 1.3 times that of Jupiter. It may also be the case that Kepler-6b has a thermal inversion of its atmosphere, where temperature increases with increasing distance {{from the center of the}} planet. However, <b>additional</b> <b>observations</b> are required to confirm or refute this possibility.|$|E

5|$|Radial {{velocity}} observations {{had been}} taken by the N2K program using the Magellan Telescopes' Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph (MIKE) at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile since 2004. Based on these observations, the stars HD 154672 and HD 205739 were among those flagged as potential planetary host stars. The two stars were identified originally as having short-orbit hot Jupiter planets, but 3.5 years of <b>additional</b> <b>observations</b> revealed that the planetary candidates' orbits were far longer than initially anticipated. HD 154672 b's discovery {{was reported in the}} Astronomical Journal by the American Astronomical Society, appearing in the journal on October 7, 2008 alongside the planet HD 205739 b. The two planets were the first to be discovered by the N2K program that worked out of the Magellan telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Anonymous {{pamphlets}} {{were published}} describing the event from significantly different perspectives. A Short Narrative of the Horrid Massacre, published {{under the auspices}} of the Boston town meeting, was principally written by James Bowdoin, a member of the governor's council and a vocal opponent of British colonial policy, along with Samuel Pemberton, and Joseph Warren. It described the shooting and other lesser incidents that took place in the days before as unprovoked attacks on peaceful, law-abiding inhabitants, and was, according to historian Neal Langley York, probably the most influential description of the event. The account it provided was drawn from more than 90 depositions taken after the event, and it included accusations that the soldiers sent by Captain Preston had been deployed with the intention of causing harm. In the interest of minimizing impact on the jury pool, city leaders held back local distribution of the pamphlet, but sent copies to other colonies and to London, where they knew depositions collected by Governor Hutchinson were en route. A second pamphlet, <b>Additional</b> <b>Observations</b> on the Short Narrative, furthered the attack on crown officials by complaining that customs officials (one of whom had left Boston to carry Hutchinson's gathered depositions to London) were abandoning their posts under the pretense that it was too dangerous for them to do their duties.|$|E

25|$|Candicine (as {{either the}} iodide or chloride) was re-investigated by Japanese pharmacologists {{in the early}} 1960s. Initial {{experiments}} on frogs, using rectus muscle and nerve-sartorius preparations from Rana nigromaculata nigromaculata, showed that the alkaloid caused contractions in the rectus at concentrations of 0.01–0.2mg/mL, and blocked {{the response of the}} nerve-sartorius to direct or indirect electrical stimulation at similar concentrations. The contraction of the rectus was inhibited by pre-treatment with tubocurarine, as was the response of the nerve-sartorius (i.e., the normal muscle twitch was not reduced by the application of candicine subsequent to tubocurarine). The action of candicine in these assays was not affected by eserine. Taking <b>additional</b> <b>observations</b> into account, these researchers concluded that the effects on frog tissue of candicine most closely resembled those of the well-known depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking drug decamethonium. An earlier comparison of 0.2mg of candicine chloride with 2mg of hordenine sulfate on the rectus muscle preparation showed that hordenine was much less potent at eliciting a contraction, even at 10× the concentration of candicine.|$|E

40|$|Radar observes targets, {{but they}} remain {{difficult}} to interpret due to the difficulty in analysing the radar range-speed sequences. The need for accurate analyses tools increases in case of extended target behaviour or multiple channel radars which give <b>additional</b> <b>observation</b> angles. Extended targets are targets with multiple scatterer responses which disturb each other and give a blurred target response. We investigate here the approach of deconvoluting the range-speed response with a point spread function and interpolate the range-speed positions to get the inner structure of the extended target. The deconvolution gives the individual elements of the extended target. The range-speed interpolation gives accurate position information. The positions and <b>additional</b> <b>observation</b> angle information are tracked with a filter. We demonstrate the approach with real radar measurements...|$|R
2500|$|Having surpassed its mapping objectives, Dawn {{climbed to}} its fifth science orbit of [...] {{beginning}} on September 2, 2016, to complete <b>additional</b> <b>observations</b> {{from a different}} angle. Dawn began raising its altitude to its sixth science orbit of [...] on November 4, 2016, with a goal of reaching it by December 2016. The return to a higher altitude will allow {{a second set of}} data at this altitude, which improves the overall science quality when added to the first batch. However, this time the spacecraft is in new orbit type where it is not spiraling and is instead orbiting {{in the same direction as}} Ceres, which reduces fuel consumption.|$|E
2500|$|As noted above, this galaxy's most {{striking}} {{feature is the}} dust lane that crosses {{in front of the}} bulge of the galaxy. [...] This dust lane is actually a symmetrical ring that encloses the bulge of the galaxy. [...] Most of the cold atomic hydrogen gas and the dust lie within this ring. [...] The ring might also contain most of the Sombrero Galaxy's cold molecular gas, although this is an inference based on observations with low resolution and weak detections. [...] <b>Additional</b> <b>observations</b> are needed to confirm that the Sombrero galaxy's molecular gas is constrained to the ring.

2500|$|Differences {{in the two}} groups' {{results may}} involve the {{planetary}} orbital characteristics assumed in calculations. According to Massachusetts Institute of Technology astronomer Sara Seager, Vogt postulated the planets around Gliese 581 had perfectly circular orbits whereas the Swiss group thought the orbits were more eccentric. This difference in approach may be {{the reason for the}} disagreement, according to Alan Boss. Butler remarked that with <b>additional</b> <b>observations,</b> [...] "I would expect that on the time scale of a year or two this should be settled." [...] Other astronomers also supported a deliberate evaluation: Seager stated, [...] "We will have consensus at some point; I don't think we need to vote right now." [...] and Ray Jayawardhana noted, [...] "Given the extremely interesting implications of such a discovery, it's important to have independent confirmation." [...] Gliese 581g is listed as [...] "unconfirmed" [...] in the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia.|$|E
