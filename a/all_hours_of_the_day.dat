25|$|Chinese {{students}} from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan live separately {{in their own}} dorms, as do foreigners. Mainlanders who are fluent in English or any foreign language may live in the foreigner- Hong Kong/Macau/Taiwan dorms, assuming they will be a roommate {{and participate in the}} foreign student activities, in order to help people get accustomed to mainland Chinese life. The quality of these dorms is usually better than that of mainland student dorms, with rooms either shared between only two people or completely private for a single student. Sexual decency attitudes are laxer than in mainlander dorms, with males and females sharing the same buildings and sometimes hallways (though not rooms). Students are allowed to bring visitors—including mainlanders—of the opposite sex to their rooms. Guests {{may or may not be}} allowed to stay overnight, depending on the rules of the dorm.
