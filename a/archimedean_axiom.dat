50|$|Going {{beyond the}} {{establishment}} of a satisfactory set of axioms, Hilbert also proved the consistency of his system relative to the theory of real numbers by constructing a model of his axiom system from the real numbers. He proved the independence of some of his axioms by constructing models of geometries which satisfy all except the one axiom under consideration. Thus, there are examples of geometries satisfying all except the <b>Archimedean</b> <b>axiom</b> V.1 (non-Archimedean geometries), all except the parallel axiom IV.1 (non-Euclidean geometries) and so on. Using the same technique he also showed how some important theorems depended on certain axioms and were independent of others. Some of his models were very complex and other mathematicians tried to simplify them. For instance, Hilbert's model for showing the independence of Desargues theorem from certain axioms ultimately led Ray Moulton to discover the non-Desarguesian Moulton plane. These investigations by Hilbert virtually inaugurated the modern study of abstract geometry in the twentieth century.|$|E

Here it is argued that, ever since the invention of Calculus by Newton, we may actually have empirical evidence that time, and thus space as well, are not Archimedean. 1. A Brief Review of the Axioms of Euclidean Geometry Ever since the discoveries of non-Euclidean geometries by Lobachevski and Bolyai in the early 1800 s, the axioms of Euclidean geometry have been divided in two: on one hand, one has the Axiom of Parallels, {{while the rest of}} the axioms constitutes what is called Absolute Geometry. And the non-Euclidean geometries occur when the axioms of Absolute Geometry are augmented either by the axiom of inexistence of parallel lines, or by the axiom of the existence of more than one parallel line. What happens, however, is that the axioms of Absolute Geometry contain what came to be called the <b>Archimedean</b> <b>Axiom,</b> which in its simplest formulation for the real line R is as follows 1 (1. 1) ∃ u> 0 : ∀ x> 0 : ∃ n ∈ N: nu> x In other words, there exists a ”step-length ” u> 0, so that, no matter how far away a point x> 0 would be, one can starting at the point 0 go beyond it in a finite number n of ”steps”. Of course, in the case of the real line R, every strictly positive u> 0 is such a ”step-length”. The issue with the <b>Archimedean</b> <b>Axiom,</b> however, is that there should exist at least one such ”step-length”. Let us therefore denote by AG the axioms of Absolute Geometry, including thus the <b>Archimedean</b> <b>Axiom,</b> while by PAG, that is, Pure Absolute Geometry, we shall denote the axioms of Absolute Geometry minus the <b>Archimedean</b> <b>Axiom.</b> In this way, we have (1. 2) AG = PAG + AA where by AA we denote the <b>Archimedean</b> <b>Axiom.</b> In the sequel we shall be interested in PAG.

30|$|Interest in {{the physics}} of non-Archimedean quantum models [1 – 5] {{is based on the}} idea that the {{structure}} of space-time for very short distances might conveniently be described in terms of non-Archimedean numbers. One of the ways to describe this violation of the <b>Archimedean</b> <b>axiom,</b> is the using p-adic analysis. Numerous applications of this analysis to mathematical physics have been proposed in [4, 6 – 8]. It is known [8] that a number of p-adic models in physics cannot be described using ordinary Kolmogorov's probability theory. New probability models--p-adic probability models were investigated in [9 – 11]. In [12 – 14], the theory of stochastic processes with values in p-adic and more general non-Archimedean fields having probability distributions with non-Archimedean values has been developed. This gives a possibility to develop the theory of statistical mechanics in the context of the p-adic theory, since it lies on the base of the theory of probability and stochastic processes. The central problems of that theory [15] is the study of infinite-volume Gibbs measures corresponding to a given Hamiltonian, which also includes a description of the set of Gibbs measures. In most cases such analysis depend on a specific properties of Hamiltonian, and complete description is often a difficult problem. This problem, in particular, relates to a phase transitions problem.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that, unknown to nearly everyone, modern {{theoretical}} Physics is significantly {{constrained by the}} tacit acceptance of the ancient <b>Archimedean</b> <b>Axiom</b> imposed upon Geometry by Euclid more than two millennia ago, an axiom which {{does not seem to}} have any modern physical motivation. By freeing oneself of this axiom a large variety of scalar fields and algebras other, and larger than the usual fields R and C of real, respectively complex numbers becomes available for mathematical modelling in theoretical Physics. This paper shows the validity of such modelling in Special Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, namely, in the case of the Lorentz transformations, the Heisenberg Uncertainty and the No Cloning property. The advantages in using such alternative scalars, specifically, given by reduced power algebras or ultrapower fields, are multiple. Among them, one can in a simple and direct way eliminate the so called "infinities in physics". More generally, one can introduce many levels of precision in theoretical Physics. This is much unlike the present situation when, with the use of R as the only basic scalar field, there can exist only one single level of precision. Also, one can establish a Second Relativity Principle in which the covariance of the equations of Physics and of basic physical phenomena and properties is considered not only with respect to changes of reference frames, but also with changes of algebras or fields of scalars. In this regard, this paper shows that the Lorentz transformations, the Heisenberg Uncertainty and the No Cloning property are indeed covariant with respect to a large variety of scalars given by reduced power algebras, or in particular, ultrapower fields...|$|E
40|$|It is {{a rather}} {{universal}} tacit and unquestioned belief - {{and even more so}} among physicists - that there is one and only one set of real scalars, namely, the one given by the usual field R of real numbers, with its usual linear order structure on the geometric line. Such a dramatically limiting and thus harmful belief comes, unknown to equally many, from the similarly tacit acceptance of the ancient <b>Archimedean</b> <b>Axiom</b> in Euclid's Geometry. The consequence of that belief is a similar belief in the uniqueness of the field C of complex numbers, and therefore, of the various spaces, manifolds, etc., be they finite or infinite dimensional, constructed upon the real or complex numbers, including the Hilbert spaces used in Quantum Mechanics. An near total lack of awareness follows about the rich self-similar structure of various linearly ordered scalar fields obtained through the ultrapower construction which extend the usual field R of real numbers. Such ultrapower field extensions contain as a rather small subset the usual field R of real numbers. The rich self-similar structure of such field extensions is due to infinitesimals, and thus also of infinitely large elements in such fields, which make such fields non-Archimedean. With the concept of walkable world, which has highly intuitive and pragmatic algebraic and geometric meaning, the mentioned rich self-similar structure is illustrated. The ultrapower fields presented can have a wide ranging relevance in Physics, among others, for a proper treatment of what are usually called the "infinities in Physics".

The equivalence allows us to revisit incomplete preferences from the viewpoint of desirability and through the derived notion of coherent lower previsions. On this basis, we obtain new results and insights: in particular, we show that the theory of incomplete preferences can be developed assuming only the existence of a worst act [...] -no best act is needed [...] -, and that a weakened <b>Archimedean</b> <b>axiom</b> suffices too; this axiom allows us also to address some controversy about the regularity assumption (that probabilities should be positive [...] -they need not), which enables us also to deal with uncountable possibility spaces; we show that it is always possible to extend in a minimal way a preference relation to one with a worst act, and yet the resulting relation is never Archimedean, except in a trivial case; we show that the traditional notion of state independence coincides with the notion called strong independence in imprecise probability [...] -this leads us to give much a weaker definition of state independence than the traditional one; we rework and uniform the notions of complete preferences, beliefs, values; we argue that Archimedeanity does not capture all the problems that can be modelled with sets of expected utilities and we provide a new notion that does precisely that. Perhaps most importantly, we argue throughout that desirability is a powerful and natural setting to model, and work with, incomplete preferences, even in case of non-Archimedean problems. This leads us to suggest that desirability, rather than preference, should be the primitive notion at the basis of decision-theoretic axiomatisations...|$|E
40|$|A relação entre geometria e física na obra de Hilbert é analisada através do caso do Axioma de Arquimedes. Começando com as questões geométricas e as formais, em {{particular}} a definição de modelos não arquimedeanos para provar a independência, passa-se logo à concepção de Hilbert da geometria como uma ciência empírica, para depois estudar a afirmação de Hilbert de que o Axioma de Arquimedes deve ser testado empiricamente. Nesse sentido, esse autor enuncia uma formulação empírica do axioma, a qual, segundo afirma, deveria ser submetida à experimentação. Tal enunciado coloca três tipos de questões. Primeiro, se é realmente um enunciado empírico ou se é um princípio metodológico que não pode ser testado. Segundo, se é uma interpretação adequada desse axioma. Por último, como poderiam ser ideali­zados testes a partir desse enunciado. Sendo as primeiras questões problemáticas, pior é o caso da terceira, pois resulta difícil conceber experimentos bem definidos nos quais a formulação empírica possa ser testada, diferente, por exemplo, do caso da medição dos ângulos de um triângulo entre três picos encomendada por Gauss. Na estudo da formulação empírica também são analisados os comentários de Leo Corry e de Michael Stöltzer sobre o assunto, resultando em questionamentos sobre sua adequação e verificabilidade. Além disso, é salientada a importância de diferenciar os conceitos de mensuração, próprio do Axioma de Arquimedes, e de continuidade no sentido definido por Dedekind, baseado fundamentalmente na crítica que Sommer faz a Hilbert. AbstractThe {{relationship between}} geometry and physics {{in the work}} of Hilbert is analyzed through the case of the axiom of Archimedes. Starting with geometrical and formal issues (in particular, the definition of non-Archimedean models used for proving its independence), following with Hilbert conception that the physics is an empirical science, finally it is studied the Hilbertian statement that the axiom must be empirically confirmed. In this sense, he conceives an empirical statement of the axiom which must be confirmed by experiment. This statement arises three kind of questions. First, whether it actually is an empirical statement or a methodological rule which is not able to test. Second, whether it is a suitable interpretation of the axiom. Third, how can be created tests in relation to the empirical statement. Besides the fact that the two initial questions are difficult, the case of the third is worst, because, as far as I know, nobody proposed such a test, i. e. how can be designed well defined experiments to confirm the empirical statement (different, for example, of the case of the measurement of the sum of the angles of a triangle, performed by Gauss). The criticisms of Leo Corry and Michael Stöltzer are analyzed too, in particular the questions about adequacy and verification of the empirical statement. Furthermore, it is emphasized the relevance of the distinction between the concepts of measurement, inherent to the <b>Archimedean</b> <b>axiom,</b> and the one of the continuity (in Dedekind’s sense), based upon the criticism of Sommer on the Foundations of Geometry of Hilbert.
