40|$|A {{number of}} mutants of polyomavirus middle T antigen (MTag) were {{constructed}} into replication-competent avian retroviruses. To assess {{the ability of}} these MTag variants to transform and to <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> the avian p 60 c-src and p 62 c-yes proto-oncogene products, we used these viruses to infect chicken embryo fibroblasts.

All transformation-competent mutant MTags retained the ability to complex with p 62 c-yes.

These master regulators <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> co-activators and co-repressors to precisely control their gene targets. Recent studies using proteomic analysis have identified a large, diverse group of coactivators and co-repressors that <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> master regulators, including Sox 2. In this report, we examined the size distribution of nuclear protein complexes containing Sox 2 and its associated proteins HDAC 1, Sall 4 and Lin 28. Interestingly, we determined that Sox 2 and HDAC 1 <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> protein complexes that vary greatly in size; whereas, Lin 28 primarily <b>associates</b> <b>with</b> smaller complexes, and Sall 4 primarily <b>associates</b> <b>with</b> larger complexes. Additionally, we examined the domains of Sox 2 necessary to mediate its association with its partner proteins Sall 4, HDAC 1 and HDAC 2. We determined that Sox 2 uses multiple and distinct domains to <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> its partner proteins. We also examined the domains of Sox 2 necessary to mediate its self-association, and we determined that Sox 2 self-association is mediated through multiple domains. Collectively, these studies provide novel insights into how Sox 2 is able to <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> {{a wide array of}} nuclea...|$|R
