These schools were run by the International Grenfell Association and the German Monrovian Missionaries.

5|$|The {{accident}} {{became a}} subject of intense news coverage. The origin of the poorly stored radioactive source was traced to KSE, which was charged with possessing radioactive substances without permission and was fined 15,000 baht (approx $450).

5|$|In 2005, a Massey University {{study in}} New Zealand {{concluded}} that sailors from the Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy and Fijian Navy who observed the tests from nearby ships later suffered {{adverse health effects}} from exposure to radioactive fallout, including cancer and genetic abnormalities in the veterans' children. Various veterans' organisations filed <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>action</b> lawsuit against the UK Ministry of Defence following {{the publication of the}} study. The effects of radioactive fallout from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained that few people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no health effects. An analysis of illnesses in veterans of Grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics that are hard to interpret. The veterans showed rates of illness that were slightly higher than the control group, but the control group had lower rates of illness than the population as a whole while the veterans had rates that were about the same. Neither of these results has a clear explanation.|$|E
5|$|In West Virginia, 27river gauging {{stations}} were 1 in 100year events, mostly along the Potomac and Monongahela basins.

Damage was estimated at nearly $700million, making it West Virginia's costliest flood, and there were 38deaths. Flooding also affected Maryland, although {{to a lesser degree}} than neighboring Virginia, with $21million in damage and one death. There was also tidal flooding in the state along the Chesapeake Bay from the storm, which washed away beaches just weeks after Hurricane Gloria affected the coastline. In Pennsylvania, flooding was worst along the Monongahela River in the state's southwest portion. During the storm, a power company opened the flood gates of the Lake Lynn dam along the river to preserve its integrity, triggering <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>action</b> lawsuit that ultimately failed. The floods damaged or destroyed 3,349houses in Pennsylvania, causing $83million in damage, as well as one death.|$|E
