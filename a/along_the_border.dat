5|$|In September 1939, Britain and France {{declared}} war on Germany following the German invasion of Poland. The Anglo-French Supreme War Council decided {{to stay on the}} defensive <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> relying on the Maginot Line in helping counter an anticipated German offensive across the German-French border. As neither side made any offensive moves, a Drôle de Guerre (Phoney War) developed as both sides stood-off <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b>|$|E

5|$|Upon leaving West Buffalo Township, Buffalo Creek {{flows into}} Buffalo Township. It then turns {{northeast}} and passes {{by the community}} of Cowan and under Pennsylvania Route 192. The creek then picks up its tributary Stony Run before passing the community of Cameron and picking up Spruce Run. At this point, Buffalo Creek flows <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> between Buffalo Township and Kelly Township. Buffalo Creek then meanders in an eastward direction, passing near a quarry, the community of Kelly Point, and the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary. After leaving Buffalo Township, the creek flows briefly <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> between Kelly Township and Lewisburg before discharging into the West Branch Susquehanna River.|$|E

5|$|The {{objective}} of the bombardment of Ancona was to delay the Italian Army from deploying its forces <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> with Austria-Hungary by destroying critical transportation systems. The surprise attack on Ancona succeeded in delaying the Italian deployment to the Alps for two weeks. This delay gave Austria-Hungary valuable time to strengthen its Italian border and re-deploy some of its troops from the Eastern and Balkan fronts.|$|E
5|$|The route {{crosses the}} Big Timber Creek into Camden County, running <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> of Runnemede and Gloucester Township. County Route 544 veers {{to the right}} onto Evesham Road, and Route 41 {{continues}} northeast on Clements Bridge Road into Runnemede. At the intersection with Route 168, Route 41 becomes county-maintained and runs concurrent with County Route 573. The two routes cross into Barrington, where they pass over the New Jersey Turnpike. Upon crossing a Conrail railroad line, Route 41 and County Route 573 run <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> of Barrington and Haddon Heights, with Barrington to the southeast and Haddon Heights to the northwest. The two routes pass under Interstate 295 before meeting U.S. Route 30 at a modified traffic circle.|$|E

5|$|Altan Khan {{eventually}} {{made peace with}} China when it opened border cities for trade in 1571, alleviating the Mongol need to raid. This, coupled with Qi and Tan's efforts to secure the frontier, brought a period of relative peace <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> However, minor raids still happened {{from time to time}} when the profits of plunder outweighed those of trade, prompting the Ming to close all gaps along the frontier around Beijing. Areas of difficult terrain once considered impassable were also walled off, leading to the well-known vistas of a stone-faced Great Wall snaking over dramatic landscapes that tourists still see today.|$|E
5|$|As a consequence, the Indonesians {{planned to}} {{increase}} their activity against the Gumbang, Tringgus and Bukit Knuckle areas, while additional forces were also subsequently redeployed against Serian. In response, Australian reconnaissance patrols were increased in order to detect movement into Sarawak, and these would later result in further fighting. Perhaps in retailiation, Indonesian mortars subsequently targeted a number of Australian positions <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> firing 13 rounds, while a further 25 rounds were fired at 11:00am. There were no casualties.|$|E
5|$|By 1971, both Egypt and Saudi Arabia had {{disengaged}} from Yemen. South Yemen {{formed a}} connection with the Soviet Union. In September 1971, Amri resigned after murdering a photographer in San'a, and more power was given to Iryani, the effective President. By then, the royalists were integrated into the new republic, except for al-Badr's family, and a consultative Council was established. Clashes <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> between the states rose, and in 1972 a small war broke.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its history}} of {{generating}} great earthquakes (1857, 1906) {{the focal point}} of earthquake hazard assessment in California has been the strike-slip San Andreas System of faults. However, a system of faults, including the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Fault System that runs <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> of the San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys, has also caused a series of moderate to large events in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The westernmost portion of this fault system ruptured in 1971 and has been identified as one of six major fault systems that pose a threat to the highly populated region.|$|E

The front <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> with Italy was relatively quiet, with only patrol clashes occurring, some sporadic artillery bombardments of border fortifications, and an unsuccessful raid by the Italians on Mount Blegoš.|$|E
