40|$|When the two <b>arcs</b> <b>of</b> the {{continuous}} phonon {{spectrum of the}} Floquet matrix of a discrete breather overlap on the unit circle, the breather solution in the infinite lattice might be stable while the corresponding solutions in finite systems appear to be unstable. More precisely, when the model parameters vary, the breather in the finite system exhibits {{a large number of}} collisions between the Floquet eigenvalues belonging to the phonon spectrum. These collisions correspond to complex cascades <b>of</b> <b>instability</b> thresholds followed near after by re-entrant stability thresholds.

Then we can predict that in the limit of an infinite system the number <b>of</b> <b>instability</b> and stability thresholds in the cascade diverges, but simultaneously the maximum amplitude <b>of</b> the <b>instabilities</b> vanishes, so that the breather in the infinite system recovers its linear stability (as long as all its other localized modes remain stable). This is the situation which is required in Cretegny et al. [Physica D 119 (1998) 73 – 87] for having inelastic phonon scattering with two channels.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the case for}} the thesis that Solomon Islands’ instability infringes on Australia’s interests. A combination of ineffective government, poverty and conflict destabilized the country and caused a civil war (1998 ‑ 2003). However, in the late 1990 s, it was recognized that similar problems affect almost all of Australia’s neighbours. The result was the emergence of the concept of the Australian <b>arc</b> <b>of</b> <b>instability.</b> The main assumption is that states to the north (Indonesia, Timor‑Leste, Papua New Guinea) and north‑east (Solomon Islands, Vanuatu) of Australia can be characterized as fragile. Persistence of instability in Solomon Islands and other countries in the immediate neighbourhood poses several challenges to Australia’s interests: favourable environment for transna‑ tional crime to thrive, increased burden on forces responsible for border protection, danger for Australians living in unstable countries, damage to Australia’s role as Oceania’s leading power and missed opportunities for Australian busi‑ nesses. Canberra has the following policy options: firstly, structuring the defence forces so they are capable of protecting vast approaches and conducting stabilization missions in Solomon Islands and other neighbouring countries. Secondly, addressing the underlining causes of instability through Australia’s foreign aid. Thirdly, encouraging and supporting initiatives which promote regional cooperation. Arkadiusz Nyzi...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} week of January 2013 the Sydney Morning Herald {{published}} its list of ten issues that will decide the coming Federal election; foreign policy, predictably, was not amongst them. 1 Historically, Australian foreign policy has demonstrated a high degree of policy continuity with bilateral support for the US Alliance, an emphasis on creating wider trade opportunities within neoliberal globalization, particularly in East Asia, and in international engagement with the world through multilateral bodies such as the United Nations and its agencies. At a broad level, then, continuity in policy is the norm, 2 while at the regional level there is rarely any difference in approach when governments change. The six-month period under review saw an elegant back-flip on asylum seeker policy, a diplomatic triumph with a seat on the UN Security Council, and some interesting developments in the regional security environment with drawdowns of the defence force in Timor-Leste and Solomon Islands. In a period where many in the world stood up and paid attention to Australia’s Prime Minister after her much reported “Misogyny Speech” 3 went viral on YouTube, we start our review with the return to the Pacific Solution before shifting to the UN Security Council election.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2010. Includes bibliographical references. The {{perception}} of a peaceful Pacific has changed {{to that of a}} region in trouble. Oceania finds itself once again in the "colonial present" (Gregory 2004). This dissertation utilizes critical geopolitical theory to map crisis discourse and its effects in the contemporary southwest Pacific. Through the recent conflict in Solomon Islands and subsequent Australian-led military intervention, I ask how geographical discourse constitutes crises and leads to outside intervention. My research methods include historical geography, document analysis, and interviews in Australia and Solomon Islands. I trace subordinating assumptions embedded in conventional geopolitical theory to see how 19 th century European views of Melanesia underpin contemporary crisis discourse. I find the 1990 s Solomon Islands' conflict framed as "ethnic violence" occurring in a "Pacific <b>arc</b> <b>of</b> <b>instability.</b> " Next, Solomon Islands became a "failed state" posing a regional security threat. In 2003, Australia initiated an intervention to "stabilize" the Solomons. Conventional geographical discourse views crises in state-centric and Eurocentric terms. Unruly spaces need management and intervention. Spatial practices of Othering and scripts of danger position the Other as a threat to modernity and our western way of life. Critical geopolitical theory sees the postcolonial state brokering natural resources to address debt and "development" in ways that clash with the values and needs of many Solomon Islanders. Through the latter lens, I find the causes of Solomon Islands' distress not simply internal or "ethnic," but tied to the "development" imperatives inhering in the postcolonial state. My fieldwork findings from Australia and Solomon Islands illuminate the intentions and the reception of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). The intervention has a neoliberal agenda and continues earlier subordinating, paternalistic attitudes toward Melanesian countries. The intervention itself contains many contradictions in terms of legitimacy by force. Many Solomon Islanders view Australia, through RAMSI, as readopting a pacifying role within a civilizing mission. Discourses of neoliberalism and the global war on terror have justified preemptive intervention in countries such as Iraq and Solomon Islands. Critical geopolitical theory offers an alternative standpoint from which we might escape the unproductive cycle of crisis discourse and military interventions...|$|E

40|$|Three {{models for}} the magnetosphere-ionosphere {{coupling}} feedback instability are considered. The first model is based on demagnetization of hot ions in the plasma sheet. The instability {{takes place in the}} global magnetosphere-ionosphere system when magnetospheric electrons drift through a spatial gradient of hot magnetospheric ion population. Such a situation exists on the inner and outer edges of the plasma sheet where relatively cold magnetospheric electrons move earthward through a radial gradient of hot ions. This leads to the formation of field-aligned currents. The effect of upward field-aligned current on particle precipitation and the magnitude of ionospheric conductivity leads to the <b>instability</b> <b>of</b> this earthward convection and to its division into convection streams oriented at some angle with respect to the initial convection direction. The growth rate <b>of</b> the <b>instability</b> is maximum for structures with sizes less than the ion Larmor radius in the equatorial plane. This may lead to formation <b>of</b> auroral <b>arcs</b> with widths about 10 km. This instability explains many features <b>of</b> such <b>arcs,</b> including their conjugacy in opposite hemispheres. However, it cannot explain the very high growth rates <b>of</b> some auroral <b>arcs</b> and very narrow arcs. For such <b>arcs</b> another type <b>of</b> <b>instability</b> must be considered. In the other two models the <b>instability</b> arises because <b>of</b> the generation of Alfven waves from growing arc-like structures in the ionospheric conductivity. One model is based on the modulation of precipitating electrons by field-aligned currents of the upward moving Alfven wave. The other model takes into consideration the reflection of Alfven waves from a maximum in the Alfven velocity at an altitude of about 3000 km. The growth of structures in both models takes place when the ionization function associated with upward field-aligned current is shifted from the edges of enhanced conductivity structures toward their centers. Such a shift arises because the structures move at a velocity different from the E×B drift. Although both models may work, the growth rate for the model, based on the modulation of the precipitating accelerated electrons, is significantly larger than that of the model based on the Alfven wave reflection. This mechanism is suitable for generation <b>of</b> auroral <b>arcs</b> with widths <b>of</b> about 1 km and less. The growth rate <b>of</b> the <b>instability</b> can be as large as 1 s- 1 , and this mechanism enables us to justify the development <b>of</b> auroral <b>arcs</b> only in one ionosphere. It is hardly suitable for excitation of wide and conjugate auroral arcs, but it may be responsible for the formation of small-scale structures inside a wide arc.

Survey data collected from 151 automotive, 82 electronics and 115 food manufacturers in Thailand are examined using cluster analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and novel approaches to statistically differentiate balanced and unbalanced SCI configurations and their performance implications. The analyses conclude the existence <b>of</b> balanced <b>arcs</b> <b>of</b> integration with uniform levels of supplier integration (SI), internal integration (II), and customer integration (CI), as well as unbalanced <b>arcs</b> <b>of</b> integration {{with an emphasis on}} CI in the automotive and electronics industries.
