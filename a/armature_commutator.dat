5000|$|The pancake motor, {{as used in}} slot cars, {{is a type of}} {{electric}} motor, which has a flat commutator and vertical shaft. It was a feature of the highly successful Aurora HO slot cars of the 1960s and 1970s. The motor was not a separate unit; instead, its individual elements - magnets, <b>armature,</b> <b>commutator</b> and brushes - fit into recesses in the blocky chassis. The power was carried by a chain of spur gears {{along the top of the}} chassis, to a pinion which drove a crown gear at the axle. Like most slot car motors, the Aurora pancakes ran on low voltage direct current.The term 'pancake' is also loosely used to refer to a car or chassis which has such a motor.|$|E
50|$|Bliss' {{original}} design {{consisted of two}} armatures spinning on a single vertical axle. One armature was connected to commutators that were 90 degrees offset from the commutators connected to the other armature. When one set of commutators is aligned with the earth's magnetic field no current is produced, but an offset angle creates a positive or negative current {{in proportion to the}} sine of the offset angle. Since the sine of the angle peaks at 90 degrees, a reading could indicate either a certain direction or the exact opposite direction. The solution to this was a second <b>armature</b> with <b>commutators</b> offset by 90 degrees to help distinguish the two opposite directions.|$|R
5000|$|Practical commutators have {{at least}} three contact segments, to prevent a [...] "dead" [...] spot where two brushes {{simultaneously}} bridge only two commutator segments. Brushes are made wider than the insulated gap, to ensure that brushes are always in contact with an <b>armature</b> coil. For <b>commutators</b> with at least three segments, although the rotor can potentially stop {{in a position where}} two commutator segments touch one brush, this only de-energizes one of the rotor arms while the others will still function correctly. With the remaining rotor arms, a motor can produce sufficient torque to begin spinning the rotor, and a generator can provide useful power to an external circuit.|$|R
50|$|A {{coil of wire}} {{rotating}} in {{a magnetic}} field produces a current which changes direction with each 180° rotation, an alternating current (AC). However many early uses of electricity required direct current (DC). In the first practical electric generators, called dynamos, the AC was converted into DC with a commutator, a set of rotating switch contacts on the <b>armature</b> shaft. The <b>commutator</b> reversed the connection of the armature winding to the circuit every 180° rotation of the shaft, creating a pulsing DC current. One of the first dynamos was built by Hippolyte Pixii in 1832. The dynamo was the first electrical generator capable of delivering power for industry. The Woolrich Electrical Generator of 1844, now in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum, is the earliest electrical generator used in an industrial process. It {{was used by the}} firm of Elkingtons for commercial electroplating.|$|R
5000|$|The DC motor was the {{mainstay}} of electric traction drives on both electric and diesel-electric locomotives, street-cars/trams and diesel electric drilling rigs for many years. It consists of two parts, a rotating armature and fixed field windings surrounding the rotating armature mounted around a shaft. The fixed field windings consist of tightly wound coils of wire fitted inside the motor case. The armature is another set of coils wound round a central shaft and {{is connected to the}} field windings through [...] "brushes" [...] which are spring-loaded contacts pressing against an extension of the <b>armature</b> called the <b>commutator.</b> The commutator collects all the terminations of the armature coils and distributes them in a circular pattern to allow the correct sequence of current flow. When the armature and the field windings are connected in series, the whole motor is referred to as [...] "series-wound". A series-wound DC motor has a low resistance field and armature circuit. Because of this, when voltage is applied to it, the current is high due to Ohm's law. The advantage of high current is that the magnetic fields inside the motor are strong, producing high torque (turning force), so it is ideal for starting a train. The disadvantage is that the current flowing into the motor has to be limited, otherwise the supply could be overloaded or the motor and its cabling could be damaged. At best, the torque would exceed the adhesion and the driving wheels would slip. Traditionally, resistors were used to limit the initial current.|$|R
