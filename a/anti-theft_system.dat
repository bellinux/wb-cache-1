Being early in the rollout of this new technology, there were only 15 different resistance values available, which, once thieves discovered this weakness, markedly reduced the value of this early system.|$|E
2500|$|The laptops {{include an}} <b>anti-theft</b> <b>system</b> which can, optionally, require each laptop to {{periodically}} {{make contact with}} a server to renew its cryptographic lease token. If the cryptographic lease expires before the server is contacted, the laptop will be locked until a new token is provided. The contact may be to a country-specific server over a network or to a local, school-level server that has been manually loaded with cryptographic [...] "lease" [...] tokens that enable a laptop to run for days or even months between contacts. Cryptographic lease tokens can be supplied on a USB flash drive for non-networked schools. The mass production laptops are also tivoized, disallowing installation of additional software or replacement of the operating system. Users interested in development need to obtain the unlocking key separately (most developer laptops for Western users already come unlocked). It is claimed that locking prevents unintentional bricking and {{is part of the}} <b>anti-theft</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Anti-theft</b> <b>systems</b> are {{designed}} to raise the difficulty of theft to an infeasible (but not necessarily impossible) level. The kind of system implemented often depends on the acceptable threshold for theft. For example, keeping money in an inside shirt pocket increases the difficulty of theft above that necessary if the pocket was on a backpack, since unauthorized access is made sufficiently more difficult. Methods of theft evolve to decrease the difficulty of theft, increased by newer <b>anti-theft</b> <b>systems.</b> Because of evolution {{on both sides and}} the social aspect of theft, the threshold for theft is very dynamic and heavily dependent on the environment. Doors in quiet suburban neighbourhoods are often left unlocked, as the perceived thresholds for theft are very high.|$|R
2500|$|Presented at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show, the Super Trofeo Stradale was {{a limited}} (150 units) {{version of the}} LP570-4 Superleggera. Boasting a dry weight of , it is [...] lighter than a comparably {{equipped}} LP570-4 Superleggera. Essentially a road version of the Super Trofeo race car, equipped with the same adjustable rear spoiler that offers an aerodynamic load 3 {{times that of the}} standard Gallardo LP 560-4 for increased dynamic stability during tight, high-speed driving. Another element taken directly from the racing version was the removable engine hood with quick-release system. The vehicle included Rosso Mars (red) body colour, 6-speed E-gear transmission, carbon fibre and Alcantara interior upholstery with red stitching, double-A-arm suspension, 19-inch wheels, titanium bearing and bolts, Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires. Optional equipment included carbon-ceramic brake discs, a tubular interior roll cage, 4-point safety belts and fire extinguisher, satellite navigation, with Bluetooth connection for mobile phones, an <b>anti-theft</b> <b>system,</b> and a lifting system that raises the front axle, grey or white brake caliper.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the initial obtainable cost of an item, the cost of replacement or recovery from theft of the item is usually considered when considering the cost of installing an <b>anti-theft</b> <b>system.</b> This cost estimation usually determines the maximum cost of the <b>anti-theft</b> <b>system</b> {{and the need to}} secure it. Expensive items will generally be secured with a higher cost <b>anti-theft</b> <b>system,</b> while low-cost items will generally be secured at a lower cost. Insurance companies will often mandate a minimum type of <b>anti-theft</b> <b>system</b> as part of the conditions for insurance.|$|E

5000|$|Sales aids (for example, the {{inclusion}} of luxury trim features, such as leather surfaces, audio <b>systems,</b> <b>anti-theft</b> <b>systems),</b> even where such accommodations are made, are generally barely {{within the limits of}} government requirements for sale to consumers, to minimize reduction in performance. Such accommodations are often reversible, so that production vehicles can be modified to racing trim. A common example of this process is the exhaust system, often modified in the production vehicle to meet legal requirements in the jurisdictions where the vehicle is sold. Since most production-based racing series allow some level of modification, including the removal of exhaust systems that reduce emissions at the cost of engine performance, vehicles that were produced and sold primarily to meet the homologation guidelines of a particular series are often designed for easy modification of such components.|$|R

40|$|Quantitative Accelerated Life Testing (QALT) is a {{solution}} for assessing the reliability of Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS). A procedure for QALT is shown in this paper and an attempt to assess the reliability level for a batch of MEMS accelerometers is reported. The testing plan is application-driven and contains combined tests: thermal (high temperature) and mechanical stress. Two variants of mechanical stress are used: vibration (at a fixed frequency) and tilting. Original equipment for testing at tilting and high temperature is used. Tilting is appropriate as application-driven stress, because the tilt movement is a natural environment for devices used for automotive and aerospace applications. Also, tilting is used by MEMS accelerometers for <b>anti-theft</b> <b>systems.</b> The test results demonstrated the excellent reliability of the studied devices, the failure rate in the “worst case” being smaller than 10 - 7 h- 1.

40|$|Abstract. KeeLoq remote {{keyless entry}} systems {{are widely used}} for access control {{purposes}} such as garage door openers or car <b>anti-theft</b> <b>systems.</b> We present the first successful differential power analysis attacks on numerous commercially available products employing KeeLoq code hopping. Our new techniques combine side-channel cryptanalysis with specific properties of the KeeLoq algorithm. They allow for efficiently revealing both the secret key of a remote transmitter and the manufacturer key stored in a receiver. As a result, a remote control can be cloned from only ten power traces, allowing for a practical key recovery in few minutes. Once knowing the manufacturer key, we demonstrate how to disclose the secret key of a remote control and replicate it from a distance, just by eavesdropping at most two messages. This key-cloning without physical access to the device has serious real-world security implications. Finally, we mount a denial-of-service attack on a KeeLoq access control system. All the proposed attacks have been verified on several commercial KeeLoq products. ...|$|R

50|$|Items with {{specific}} functionality {{can often be}} disabled to prevent use of the item should it be stolen. The <b>anti-theft</b> <b>system</b> can require disabling on every use, or enabling when the item should be secured. Disabling the <b>anti-theft</b> <b>system</b> is usually done by requiring identification of the owner at some stage of use. Identification can occur physically or through other methods (physical keys, numerical codes, complex passwords, biometric identification). This can work even retrospectively: as a stolen credit card can easily be invalidated with {{a phone call to}} the issuing bank, the motivation to steal one is reduced.|$|E

25|$|A {{firmware}} rootkit uses device or platform firmware {{to create}} a persistent malware image in hardware, such as a router, network card, hard drive, or the system BIOS. The rootkit hides in firmware, because firmware is not usually inspected for code integrity. John Heasman demonstrated the viability of firmware rootkits in both ACPI firmware routines and in a PCI expansion card ROM. In October 2008, criminals tampered with European credit card-reading machines before they were installed. The devices intercepted and transmitted credit card details via a mobile phone network. In March 2009, researchers Alfredo Ortega and Anibal Sacco published details of a BIOS-level Windows rootkit that was able to survive disk replacement and operating system re-installation. A few months later they learned that some laptops are sold with a legitimate rootkit, known as Absolute CompuTrace or Absolute LoJack for Laptops, preinstalled in many BIOS images. This is an <b>anti-theft</b> technology <b>system</b> that researchers showed can be turned to malicious purposes.|$|R
