40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the constructivist, negotiated perspective to INGO <b>accountability.</b> According to this perspective, INGO <b>accountability</b> {{is a process}} of mutual negotiations between different INGO stakeholders who hold different <b>accountability</b> demands. Acknowledging that this perspective provides a good starting point for a better understanding of INGO <b>accountability,</b> we comment on this conceptualization of INGO <b>accountability.</b> Through an analysis of <b>accountability</b> instruments and procedures, we examine closely how the demands of the INGO’s stakeholders are embedded in particular relationships of <b>accountability</b> which are sustained by particular <b>accountability</b> logics. From this analysis, we point out that, due to the differences that exist between these <b>accountability</b> logics, processes of negotiation are likely to be filled with complex tensions and trade-offs. Moreover, as some <b>accountability</b> logics are much clearer and more compelling than others, a constructivist perspective on INGO <b>accountability</b> does not automatically coincide with an understanding of INGO <b>accountability</b> in which primordial importance is given to the beneficiaries. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|This study {{provides}} an exploratory {{analysis of the}} current system of public sector <b>accountability</b> in Mongolia. Mongolia adopted a new democratic Constitution in 1992 with a special chapter devoted to the protection of human rights. Regular elections have been held and key democratic institutions have been established. However, there is a growing dissatisfaction in Mongolia due to the inability of the government to tackle core issues of development, including poverty, inequality, corruption and environmental degradation. <b>Accountability</b> of power holders to public is a defining feature of democracy. This study finds that the notion of <b>accountability</b> as understood in democratic societies is relatively new in Mongolia. Despite tremendous progress in all areas of development over the past two decades, the creation of <b>accountability</b> mechanisms which assist <b>accountability</b> of power holders to the public has been slow. A framework of three types of <b>accountability</b> was used in this study: political <b>accountability,</b> policy <b>accountability,</b> and procedural <b>accountability.</b> This study finds that i) more <b>accountability</b> mechanisms need to be created in order to constrain the power of parliamentary majority and the executive, ii) policy process need to take policy outcomes into account to ensure policy <b>accountability,</b> and iii) adoption of international and commonly recognised procedural rules and regulations needs to be completed to enhance procedural <b>accountability.</b> In addition, an <b>accountability</b> framework would enable ensuring complementary nature of different types of <b>accountability.</b> There needs to be an institutionalised system that reviews and ensures existence of <b>accountability</b> mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{conceptual}} inquiry was to add clarity and substance {{to the idea of}} <b>accountability.</b> It was conducted in two parts. First, the conversations surrounding <b>accountability</b> were reviewed to seek answers to such questions as: What are the purposes of <b>accountability</b> and whose purposes is <b>accountability</b> intended to serve? What can be considered an instance of <b>accountability,</b> and why do some consider an instance to be one of <b>accountability</b> while others do not? and What concepts need to be better understood in order to bring <b>accountability</b> into being? The etymology of <b>accountability</b> was reviewed, as well as the historical relationship between <b>accountability</b> and democracy. Particular attention was paid to the essential expectations of the principle of <b>accountability</b> in democratic governance. Manzer's (1994) review of the constituent meanings of educational policy in Canada was used to move the research into the context of public education. His typology illustrated the extent to which interpretations of <b>accountability</b> in education are dependent upon competing liberal visions of the public good. The second part of this research provided a reconceptualization of <b>accountability</b> for education. Having found the contemporary <b>accountability</b> models lacking, it focussed efforts on the development of a framework that would be sufficiently robust to account for the political nature of <b>accountability</b> reforms, yet capable of centering discussions on the essence of the concept itself. Three key principles, originally taken from the Auditor General of Canada's Report (1996), provided the conceptual core of this framework. These principles (disclosure, transparency, redress) trace their historical origin to the idea of <b>accountability</b> in democracy. They provided a place to link <b>accountability</b> procedures back to conceptually, and thus could serve as a way to test their integrity. In addition, four key elements of <b>accountability</b> (planning, evaluation, responsiveness and communication) were identified and discussed in depth with reference to both their legitimacy within the present ideological divide, and their relationship to the concept of <b>accountability</b> itself. This research provided a way to view <b>accountability</b> as a neutral concept. It called for increased research focussed on <b>accountability</b> principles (particularly transparency and redress) and elements to enhance our understanding of how <b>accountability</b> is created and sustained in public education...|$|R
40|$|In {{academic}} communication, {{the notion}} of <b>accountability</b> is central, because academic discourse essentially involves the communication of knowledge – knowledge for which someone must assume <b>accountability.</b> This paper considers the use of knowledge-stating verbs in knowledge statements. It investigates the <b>accountability</b> contexts (High <b>accountability,</b> Medium-to-High <b>accountability,</b> Medium-to-Low <b>accountability</b> and Low <b>accountability)</b> for seven knowledge-stating verbs in order to ascertain if different knowledge-stating verbs appear in different kinds of <b>accountability</b> contexts. The verbs investigated are argue, claim, suggest, propose, maintain, assume and believe. The empirical basis for the investigation comes from two different academic disciplines, linguistics and literary studies, and the investigation also addresses {{the issue of whether}} the knowledge-stating verbs considered appear in the same or different <b>accountability</b> contexts across the two disciplines. The conclusions to be drawn {{on the basis of the}} investigation are that (i) individual knowledge-stating verbs do feature in different kinds of <b>accountability</b> contexts, but (ii) there is little evidence to the effect that there should be any significant differences between linguistics and literary studies with respect to the <b>accountability</b> contexts associated with the individual knowledge-stating verbs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: According to the “standard model ” of <b>accountability,</b> holding another actor {{accountable}} entails sanctioning that actor if {{it fails}} to fulfill its obligations without a justification or excuse. Less powerful actors therefore cannot hold more powerful actors accountable, because they cannot sanction more powerful actors. This inequality appears unlikely to disappear soon. There is therefore a pressing need for “second-best ” forms of accountability: forms that are feasible under conditions of inequality, but deliver {{as many of the}} benefits of standard <b>accountability</b> as possible. This article describes a model of second-best <b>accountability</b> that fits this description, which I call “surrogate <b>accountability.</b> ” I argue that surrogate <b>accountability</b> can provide some of the benefits of standard <b>accountability,</b> but not others, that it should be evaluated according to different normative criteria than standard <b>accountability,</b> and that, while surrogate <b>accountability</b> has some benefits that standard <b>accountability</b> lacks, it is usually normatively inferior to standard <b>accountability...</b>|$|R
