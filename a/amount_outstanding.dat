40|$|We {{provide a}} {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of the}} determinants of trading in the sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) market, using weekly data for single-name sovereign CDS from October 2008 to September 2015. We describe the anatomy of the sovereign CDS market, derive a law of motion for gross positions and their components, and identify the key factors that drive the cross-sectional and time-series properties of trading volume and net notional <b>amounts</b> <b>outstanding.</b> While a single principal component accounts for 54 percent {{of the variation in}} sovereign CDS spreads, the largest common factor explains only 7 percent of the variation in sovereign CDS net notional <b>amounts</b> <b>outstanding.</b> Moreover, unlike for CDS spreads, common global factors explain very little of the variation in sovereign CDS trading and net notional <b>amounts</b> <b>outstanding,</b> suggesting that it is driven primarily by idiosyncratic country risk. We analyze several local and regional channels that may explain the trading in sovereign CDS: (a) country-specific credit risk shocks, including changes in a country's credit rating and related outlook changes, (b) the announcement and issuance of domestic and international debt, (c) macroeconomic sentiment derived from conventional and unconventional monetary policy, macro-economic news and shocks, and (d) regulatory channels, such as changes in bank capital adequacy requirements. All our findings suggest that sovereign CDS are more likely used for hedging than for speculative purposes...|$|R

5000|$|Positions in the OTC {{derivatives}} market {{have increased}} {{at a rapid}} pace since the last triennial survey was undertaken in 2004. Notional <b>amounts</b> <b>outstanding</b> of such instruments totalled $516 trillion {{at the end of}} June 2007, 135% higher than the level recorded in the 2004 survey (Graph 4). This corresponds to an annualised compound rate of growth of 33%, which is higher than the approximatively 25% average annual rate of increase since positions in OTC derivatives were first surveyed by the BIS in 1995. Notional <b>amounts</b> <b>outstanding</b> provide useful information on the structure of the OTC derivatives market but should not be interpreted as a measure of the riskiness of these positions. Gross market values, which represent the cost of replacing all open contracts at the prevailing market prices, have increased by 74% since 2004, to $11 trillion at the end of June 2007.

50|$|For a fully amortizing loan, with a fixed (i.e., non-variable) {{interest}} rate, {{the payment}} {{remains the same}} throughout the term, regardless of principal balance owed. For example, the payment on the above scenario will remain $733.76 {{regardless of whether the}} outstanding (unpaid) principal balance is $100,000 or $50,000. Paying down more than the monthly contractual amount reduces the <b>amount</b> <b>outstanding</b> and thus the interest that is payable to the lender; if the contractual monthly payment stays the same, the number of payments and the term of the loan must decrease. Conversely, paying down less than the monthly contractual amount increases the <b>amount</b> <b>outstanding</b> and thus the interest payable (negative amortization); if the contractual monthly payment stays the same, the number of payments and the term of the loan must increase.|$|E

5000|$|From 1923 the <b>amounts</b> <b>outstanding</b> under earlier acts {{were paid}} to the British {{government}} as [...] "land annuities", accruing in a Land Purchase Fund. This was fixed at £250,000 annually in 1925. In December 1925 William Cosgrave lamented that there were already: [...] "250,000 occupiers of uneconomic holdings, the holdings of such a valuation as did not permit of a decent livelihood for the owners". Despite this, his government continued to subdivide larger landholdings, primarily to gain electoral support.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} show the true rate {{underlying}} a flat rate, {{it is necessary to}} use the declining balance amortization schedule, dividing the total cost to the borrower by the average <b>amount</b> <b>outstanding.</b> In the first three examples on the right the borrower is quoted 1% a month. These are loans of $1,200 each, amortized with level payments over 4, 12 and 24 months. In the 4-month example, the borrower will make four equal payments of $300 in principal and 4 equal payments of $12 (1% of $1,200) in interest. The total cost of this loan is the principal plus $48.00 in interest, whilst the average <b>amount</b> <b>outstanding</b> was approximately $600. This yields an annualized flat rate of 12%, and an annualized effective or true rate of 19.05%. The true rate can also be calculated by iteration from the amortization schedule, using the compound interest formula.|$|E
