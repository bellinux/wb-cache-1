40|$|Aim: то {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of the combined method for the correction of early and long-existing hypertrophic scars and keloids by intrascar injection of "Longidaza ME" medication and phonophoresis. Material and methods. A combined method of correction of hypertrophic scars and keloids, comprising the introduction of the "Longidaza ME" by intrascar injection and using phonophoresis. Results. Evaluation of the results was determined based on indicators of dermatology quality of life index. When comparing long-term results positive result was noted in 90 % of cases. Conclusion. The study confirmed {{the effectiveness of}} the combined method in preventing reactive growth of connective tissue and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> regression of <b>fibrosis,</b> i. e. to correct a complex autoregulatory reactions of connective tissue, which is clinically expressed in resorption and deposition of scar...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that long thin {{asbestos}} fibres are more pathogenic in in vivo and more active in in vitro assays than short fibre samples. In the present study a long fibre amosite asbestos sample and a short fibre sample prepared from it were tested for <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> inflammation in the peritoneal cavity of the mouse; a UICC sample intermediate in fibre size and an inert compact dust, TiO 2, were also tested. The ability of the dust samples <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> inflammation, as judged by macrophage and neutrophil recruitment, was ranked in the order long fibre greater than UICC greater than short fibre greater than TiO 2. Ability of amosite samples <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> inflammation was therefore related to the proportion of long fibres. The enhanced ability of long fibres <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> inflammation and cause macrophage activation is probably a key factor in the ability of long fibres <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> pulmonary <b>fibrosis</b> and may also be important in fibre carcinogenesis...|$|R
