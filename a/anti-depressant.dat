40|$|SUMMARY: <b>Anti-depressants</b> {{are used}} largely, but have serious side effects. We show that both {{selective}} serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic <b>anti-depressants</b> (TCAs) {{increase the risk}} of hip/femur fracture and that this risk is time related and depends on the degree of serotonin transporter inhibition. This should be considered when prescribing <b>anti-depressants</b> to patients. INTRODUCTION: <b>Anti-depressants</b> are known to have serious side effects. We examined the association between the use of <b>anti-depressants</b> and the risk of hip/femur fractures with a special focus on the relation with the degree of 5 -hydroxytryptamine transporter (5 -HTT) inhibition and the duration of use. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted within the Dutch PHARMO-RLS database. Cases (n = 6, 763) were adult patients with a first hip/femur fracture during the study period. For each case, four controls (n = 26341) were matched by age, gender and geographic region. RESULTS: The risk of hip/femur fracture increased with current use of SSRIs (adjusted odds ratio (OR(adj)) 2. 35 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 94 - 2. 84]) and TCAs (ORadj 1. 76 [95 % CI 1. 45 - 2. 15]). The risk of hip/femur fracture declined rapidly after discontinuation of use. The risk of hip/femur fracture increased as the degree of 5 -HTT inhibition of all <b>anti-depressants</b> increased from OR(adj) 1. 64 [95 % CI 1. 14 - 2. 35] for drugs with low 5 -HTT inhibition to OR(adj) 2. 31 [95 % CI 1. 94 - 2. 76] for those with high 5 -HTT inhibiting properties. CONCLUSION: Current use of both SSRIs and TCAs increase hip/femur fracture risk. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanistic pathways and the relation with the underlying pathophysiology. Until then, the elevated fracture risk should be considered when prescribing <b>anti-depressants...</b>|$|R

25|$|A 2010 {{meta-analysis}} {{found that}} no trial employing both blinding and psychological placebos has shown CBT {{to be effective}} in either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and that the effect size of CBT was small in major depressive disorder. They also found a lack of evidence to conclude that CBT was effective in preventing relapses in bipolar disorder. Evidence that severe depression is mitigated by CBT is also lacking, with <b>anti-depressant</b> medications still viewed as significantly more effective than CBT, although success with CBT for depression was observed beginning in the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Hamilton's later {{career was}} marred by blood doping scandals. The first case came in the 2004 Olympics, when {{he was accused of}} blood doping by Olympic officials. Hamilton was allowed to keep his medal. Later that year, he was accused again of doping, in the Vuelta a España, and {{subsequently}} served a two-year suspension from racing. He returned to the sport for the 2007 season only to be suspended by his team after being implicated in the Operation Puerto drug scandal. He returned a second time to the sport and retired in April 2009 when he failed an out-of-competition check for taking an herbal <b>anti-depressant</b> which contained the banned substance DHEA.|$|E
25|$|Study 329 was a {{clinical}} trial conducted in North America from 1994 to 1998 to study the efficacy of paroxetine, an SSRI <b>anti-depressant,</b> in treating 12- to 18-year-olds diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Led by Martin Keller, then {{professor of psychiatry at}} Brown University, and funded by the British pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham—known since 2000 as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)—the study compared paroxetine with imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, and placebo (an inert pill). SmithKline Beecham had released paroxetine in 1991, marketing it as Paxil in North America and Seroxat in the UK. The drug attracted sales of $11.7billion in the United States alone from 1997 to 2006, including $2.12billion in 2002, the year before it lost its patent.|$|E
25|$|Despite admitting {{throughout}} {{the work that}} he very regularly used EPO, testosterone pills and patches, and autologous blood transfusions (all banned practices), Hamilton staunchly opposed the sanction, since he had never used the blood of another person. It was speculated that Fuentes and his assistant had mixed the blood of another rider with his. His career in a shambles, he raced for lesser team after his suspension, tested positive for DHEA (in an OTC herbal <b>anti-depressant)</b> and retired. He later {{received a call from}} federal investigator Jeff Novitzky, who wanted to talk to him. He refused and was served a subpoena, whereupon he decided to tell everything. Some former teammates of Lance Armstrong and other witnesses appeared, until the federal government dropped the charges. The USADA took over the investigation under civil law, and Armstrong was ultimately stripped of all his titles from August 1998 onward. He was also banned from bicycle racing and triathlon competition.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways used to treat loneliness, social isolation, and clinical depression. The first step that most doctors recommend to patients is therapy. Therapy is a common and effective way of treating loneliness and is often successful. Short term therapy, {{the most common form}} for lonely or depressed patients, typically occurs over a period of ten to twenty weeks. During therapy, emphasis is put on understanding the cause of the problem, reversing the negative thoughts, feelings, and attitudes resulting from the problem, and exploring ways to help the patient feel connected. Some doctors also recommend group therapy as a means to connect with other sufferers and establish a support system. Doctors also frequently prescribe anti-depressants to patients as a stand-alone treatment, or in conjunction with therapy. It may take several attempts before a suitable <b>anti-depressant</b> medication is found. Some patients may also develop a resistance to a certain type of medication and need to switch periodically.|$|E
