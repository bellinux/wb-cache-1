5|$|<b>A</b> <b>white</b> dwarf is {{very hot}} when it forms, {{but because it}} has no source of energy, it will {{gradually}} radiate its energy and cool. This means that its radiation, which initially has a high color temperature, will lessen and redden with time. Over a very long time, <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf will cool and its material will begin to crystallize (starting with the core). The star's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light, and {{it will become a}} cold black dwarf. Because the length of time it takes for <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years), it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist. The oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvins.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>white</b> dwarf, {{also called}} a {{degenerate}} dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. <b>A</b> <b>white</b> dwarf is very dense: its mass {{is comparable to}} that of the Sun, while its volume is {{comparable to that of}} Earth. <b>A</b> <b>white</b> dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name white dwarf was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922.|$|E

5|$|Although thin, these {{outer layers}} {{determine}} the thermal {{evolution of the}} white dwarf. The degenerate electrons in the bulk of <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf conduct heat well. Most of <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf's mass is therefore at almost the same temperature (isothermal), {{and it is also}} hot: <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf with surface temperature between 8,000K and 16,000K will have a core temperature between approximately 5,000,000K and 20,000,000K. The white dwarf is kept from cooling very quickly only by its outer layers' opacity to radiation.|$|E

5|$|Compression of <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume.

This electron degeneracy pressure supports <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass white dwarf is much greater than that of a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius of <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E
