50|$|The {{improvements}} {{with respect}} to TRAME2 were the support of IPv4, the introduction of an SNMP supervision agent, a new Flow Control system, an improved distance metric making the system less dynamic, and an <b>autoexec</b> task to periodically check hardware and software.|$|E
5000|$|System macro means macros that {{interact}} with the basic operators in a word document (like often-used functionalities like FileSave, FileSaveAs which are macros).The strength, but the weakness of a word document is that such types of macros can be redefinied by users.This allow a great flexibility for the user, but, this is a flaw too that hackers can exploit to take down {{the control of the}} document and the computer where the word document is opened.Such type of viruses use automatic and semi-automatic macros, they can be launched by any action or some events without the user’s knowledge or consent.For example, a word document have the following macros: <b>AutoExec,</b> AutoNew, AutoClose, AutoOpen, AutoExit, so it's easy for a hacker to replace these basic functionalities by a macro virus which have the same name as the original functionality.Also, a combination of shortcut keys can be associated with a system command (like Ctrl+B to set up the bold font) and the user can change them, replacing them by customs macros. So a hacker can modify and create such macros that the user will activate by using the shortcut key.Such macros can also be activated by a macro button, like a button [...] "Click here for further information" [...] which seems common and safely.|$|E
40|$|An {{untapped}} {{resource of}} metadata functionality exists within {{the grasp of}} the SAS programmer. At first glance this rich mine of information is hidden from view, however metadata functions can extract this valuable information {{for a variety of}} different uses. All of which is available {{within the framework of the}} humble SAS data step. Information extracted can vary from creating customised <b>autoexec</b> files based on a metadata group to the development of customised Enterprise Guide plug-ins that send automatic emails to groups defined in metadata. The metadata can even be queried to perform authentication and authorisation. The paper will explain how to use the metadata functions available in the data step environment and highlight different uses of the information that can be extracted. It will also describe the basics of writing metadata queries via the Metadata Utility within the SAS Management Console. This paper is for SAS programmers who wish to learn how the information is stored in the metadata server and how can this be extracted...|$|E
40|$|Whether {{writing a}} short SAS ® script for {{statistical}} analysis, developing new software powered by SAS, or customizing an existing SAS script to your needs, {{it is important}} to get {{off to a good start}} when using the SAS Windowing Environment (commonly called the SAS Display Manager). This is the GUI (Graphical User Interface) that SAS provides to write and submit SAS code interactively (along with a myriad of other functions). Programming efficiency can begin at the initialization of SAS. This paper will discuss two methods to change SAS options when a SAS 9 session begins. The first method discussed will be the use of the SASV 9. CFG file. The second will be the creation and use of an <b>autoexec.</b> sas file. Furthermore, it will discuss types of options that can be changed with each of these methods and explain why changing these options at startup can increase programming efficiency and make programming in SAS a more personalized and convenient experience. Examples of each method will be presented. Finally, a discussion of autocall macros with examples illustrating how they relate to these two methods is provided...|$|E
