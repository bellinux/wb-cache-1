5|$|In May 1916 the Australian Government {{offered the}} British Army Council <b>a</b> <b>sixth</b> {{division}} of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), the Australian Army's main expeditionary force during World War I.

In such an event, the government proposed breaking up the division to reinforce the five others. The Army Council declined this offer as it preferred Australia to raise only as many units as it could reinforce.|$|E
