40|$|I {{analyze the}} {{correlation}} between <b>a</b> nation <b>leader’s</b> foreign education experience and their nation’s GDP growth and economic freedom in African, Asian, and South American countries. There is a statistically significant correlation between <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> foreign education and the country’s GDP growth rate, especially in Africa. Data also shows that <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> foreign education is positively correlated with his country’s economic freedom. Despite {{the fact that the}} regressions can only demonstrate correlation as opposed to causation relationships among variables, further analysis of the results concludes that <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> education and the country’s development are reciprocal. The findings of this paper shine light on future policy directions for developing countries...|$|R

40|$|Status {{within a}} group {{can be quickly}} achieved. Research has shown, for instance, that {{individual}} traits such as race, gender, or expertise influence individuals’ status and their team’s early interactions. The current research digs into the micro-behaviors of these early interactions by investigating the potent impact of <b>a</b> team <b>leader’s</b> nonverbal behavior (e. g., unequal visual attention) on the status hierarchy within small groups. In Study 1, individuals who received more of <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> visual attention {{were more likely to}} influence group decisions than individuals who received less of <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> visual attention, and groups that received this unequal visual attention performed worse than groups that received equal attention. Study 2 investigated whether the effects of <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> visual attention were due simply to the attention itself or whether it depended on the leader’s status. The results supported the latter hypothesis, as attention transferred status: more attention from <b>a</b> high-status <b>leader</b> increased <b>a</b> person’s status but more attention from <b>a</b> low-status <b>leader</b> decreased it. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Overlordship was {{a central}} feature of Anglo-Saxon {{politics}} which began before Æthelberht's time; kings were described as overlords {{as late as the}} ninth century.

Tribute from dependents could lead to wealth. A weaker state also might ask or pay for the protection of a stronger neighbour against a warlike third state.|$|E

40|$|Political {{conflict}} across Africa {{is often}} {{linked to the}} pervasive use of patron-age in retaining control of the state. However, few sources of data have been available to systematically {{examine the relationship between}} <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> patronage strategies and the likelihood of an extraconstitutional change in power. This article employs ministerial appointments to the cabinet as a proxy for changes in the size of <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> patronage coalition. With time-series cross-section data on 40 African countries, this study shows that the size of cabinets varies systematically according to regime type, resource constraints, ethnic fractionalization, and total population. It then shows that African leaders extend their tenure in office by expanding their patronage coalition through cabinet appointments. A proportional hazards model of regime duration indicates that cabinet expansion lowers the probability of <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> being deposed through a coup. The appointment of one additional minister to the cabinet lowers <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> coup risk by a greater extent than does a 1 -percentage-point increase in economic growth...|$|R
