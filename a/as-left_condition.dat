5000|$|The reactor {{was shut}} down in 1987 when the Secretary of Energy {{determined}} that no more plutonium was needed and placed on cold standby in 1988, with [...] "final deactivation" [...] beginning in 1994 and completing in 1998. Deactivation consisted of shutdown and isolation of operational systems and the cleanup of radiological and hazardous waste. N-Reactor (the 105-N Reactor and the 109-N Heat Exchanger Building) were placed in Interim Safe Storage (ISS) in 2012. ISS consists of {{the removal of the}} fuel storage basin, ancillary support facilities, and most portions of the shield wall that surround the 105-N Reactor. In addition, the 109-N Heat Exahanger Building was removed up to the steam generator cells. A new steel roof was installed over the remaining structures. Before and after pictures are found in the facility status change form. Final room status report of the current <b>as-left</b> <b>condition</b> of accessible rooms in the ISS has been documented.|$|E

Additional investigation identified radiological contamination within an area of 18, 750 ft 2 (1, 750 m 2) north of Brookhaven Avenue, referred to herein as the contiguous area, {{as well as in}} eleven discrete locations within wooded areas adjacent to the northeastern, northwestern, and southeastern corners of the former HWMF boundaries. The contamination is believed to be a result of historical operations associated with the transfer of wastes to the former HWMF and historical stormwater runoff from contaminated soils within the facility. The cleanup of the former HWMF Perimeter Area was performed as a non-time-critical removal action authorized by the Final Action Memorandum, Removal Action for Contaminated Soil from the Former Hazardous Waste Management Facility Perimeter Area (June, 2009). The cleanup of this area used the same cleanup goals and methodology required for radiologically contaminated soils in the Operable Unit (OU) I Record of Decision (ROD). The soil cleanup objectives for radiological contamination were based on a dose, from remaining concentrations of all radionuclides present, of {{less than or equal to}} 15 millirem per year (mrem/year) above background to a resident (non-farmer) after 50 years of institutional control. Soil remediation activities for the former HWMF Perimeter Area commenced in June, 2009 and were completed in November, 2009. The following summarizes the <b>as-left</b> <b>conditions</b> at the former HWMF Perimeter Area and how they satisfy the requirements of the OU I ROD:...|$|R
