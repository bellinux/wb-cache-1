The data were sent to six <b>anonymous</b> <b>reviewers</b> and the resulting review was published in June 1999. It stated that Pusztai's experiments were poorly designed, contained uncertainties in the composition of diets, tested too few rats, used incorrect statistical methods and lacked consistency within experiments. Pusztai responded by saying the reviewers had reviewed only internal Rowett reports, which did not include the design or methodology of the experiments.|$|E
500|$|Yelp {{receives}} {{about six}} subpoenas a month {{asking for the}} names of <b>anonymous</b> <b>reviewers,</b> mostly from business owners seeking litigation against those writing negative reviews. In 2012 the Alexandria Circuit Court and the Virginia Court of Appeals held Yelp in contempt for refusing to disclose the identities of seven reviewers that anonymously criticized a carpet-cleaning business; in 2014 Yelp appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court.

5000|$|For {{the first}} time since the project initiated, the overall CWILA Count had reached its closest to an equal balance of male to female reviewers with the final ratio being 49% of reviews being written by men and 48% by women.

50|$|This {{resulted}} in a media frenzy, and Rowett Institute's director Philip James, after initially supporting Pusztai, suspended him and banned both Pusztai and Susan Bardocz from speaking publicly. He also used misconduct procedures to seize the raw data. The Rowett Institute eventually published an audit criticizing Pusztai's results and sent the raw data to six <b>anonymous</b> <b>reviewers</b> who also criticized Pusztai's work. Pusztai sent the audit report and his rebuttal to scientists who requested it, and in February 1999, twenty-one European and American scientists released a memo supporting Pusztai.|$|E

The editors of Geometriae Dedicata state that they suspect Marcu of plagiarism, as he submitted a manuscript which is [...] "more-or-less word for word the same" [...] as a paper by Lindström. Grossman, Kageyama, Pettet, and <b>anonymous</b> <b>reviewers</b> have accused Marcu of plagiarism in MathSciNet reviews. According to the managing editors of Menemui Matematik, Marcu's paper in that journal is a well known result in graph theory, and the paper [...] "should not have been published".|$|E

In 2006, Physical Review Letters rejected the paper for publication, as well. However, according to the PRL assessment, one of the <b>anonymous</b> <b>reviewers</b> noted that (he or she [...] ) had been to two meetings in the previous months with John Pendry's group, who were also working on a cloaking device. From the meetings, the reviewer also became aware of a patent that Pendry and his colleagues were supposed to file. Leonhardt {{was at the time}} unaware of the Pendry group's work. Because of the Pendry meetings Leonhardt's work was not really considered new physics by the reviewer and, therefore, did not merit publication in Physical Review Letters.|$|E
