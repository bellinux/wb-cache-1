40|$|We have {{utilized}} the Mössbauer effect {{to study the}} hyperfine field structure of iron Urushibara catalysts. The Mössbauer spectra of those catalysts prepared using zinc show that they consist of a mixture of magnetic and non‐magnetic Fe‐Zn alloys. Both the magnetic field distribution in the magnetic phase and the relative amounts of magnetic and non‐magnetic phases depend on the Fe‐Zn ratio used {{in the preparation of}} the catalyst. This dependence on Fe–Zn ratio is in contrast to iron Urushibara catalysts prepared using aluminum (and Raney iron type catalysts) in which the active phase is almost pure α‐fe, irrespective of the Fe‐Al ratio. The activity of zinc prepared iron Urushibara catalysts for certain hydrogentation reactions is known to be greater than that of aluminum prepared iron Urushibara catalysts and the above results suggest a relationship between activity and the modification of the iron catalyst by <b>alloyed</b> <b>zinc.</b> The alloying behavior of the Fe‐Zn particles may be analogous to that of the so‐called bimetallic clusters observed in other alloy systems...|$|E
40|$|<b>Alloyed</b> <b>zinc</b> sulfide (ZnS) {{has shown}} promise as a {{relatively}} inexpensive and earth-abundant transparent conducting material (TCM). Though Cu-doped ZnS {{has been identified as}} a high-performing p-type TCM, the corresponding n-doped ZnS has, to date, been challenging to synthesize in a controlled manner; this is because the dopant atoms compete with hole-inducing zinc vacancies near the conduction band minimum as the most thermodynamically stable intrinsic point defects. We thus aim to identify the most promising n-type ZnS-based TCM, with the optimal combination of physical stability, transparency, and electrical conductivity. Using a relatively new method for calculating the free energy of both the sphalerite (cubic) and wurtzite (hexagonal) phases of undoped and doped ZnS, we find that doped ZnS is more stable in the hexagonal structure. This, for the first time, fundamentally explains previous experimental observations of the coexistence of both phases in doped ZnS; hence, it profoundly impacts future work on sulfide TCMs. We also employ hybrid density functional theory calculations and a new carrier transport model, AMSET (ab initio model for mobility and Seebeck coefficient using the Boltzmann transport equation), to analyze the defect physics and electron mobility of the different cation- (B, Al, Ga, In) and anion-doped (F, Cl, Br, I) ZnS, in both the cubic and hexagonal phases, at various dopant compositions, temperatures, and carrier concentrations. Among all doped ZnS candidates, Al-doped ZnS (AZS) exhibits the highest dopant solubility, largest electronic band gap, and highest electrical conductivity of 3830, 1905, and 321 S cm(- 1), corresponding to the possible carrier concentrations of n = 10 (21), 10 (20), and 10 (19) cm(- 3), respectively, at the optimal 6. 25 % dopant concentration of Al and the temperature of 300 K...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{exceptionally}} improved {{sensing capability}} of highly porous 3 -D hybrid ceramic networks {{with respect to}} reducing gases is demonstrated for the first time. The 3 -D hybrid ceramic networks are based on metal oxides (MexOy and ZnxMe 1 -xOy, Me= Fe, Cu, Al) doped and <b>alloyed</b> <b>zinc</b> oxide tetrapods (ZnO-T) forming numerous heterojunctions. A change in morphology of the samples and formation of different complex microstructures is achieved by mixing the metallic (Fe, Cu, Al) microparticles with ZnO tetrapods grown by flame transport synthesis (FTS) approach with different weight ratios (ZnO:Me, e. g., 20 : 1) and followed by subsequent thermal annealing them in air. The gas sensing studies reveal the possibility to control and change/tune the selectivity of the materials, depending on the elemental content ratio {{and the type of}} the added metal oxide in 3 -D ZnO-T hybrid networks. While pristine ZnO-T networks showed a good response to H 2 gas, a change/tune in selectivity to ethanol vapour with a decrease in optimal operating temperature was observed in the networks hybridized with Fe-oxide and Cu-oxide. In case of hybridization with ZnAl 2 O 4 an improvement of H 2 gas response (to ≈ 7. 5) was reached at lower doping concentrations (20 : 1), whereas the increasing in concentration of ZnAl 2 O 4 (10 : 1), the selectivity changes to methane CH 4 gas (response ≈ 28). Selectivity tuning to different gases is attributed to the catalytic properties of the metal oxides after hybridization, while the sensitivity improvement is mainly associated with additional modulation of resistance by the built-in potential barriers between n-n and n-p heterojunctions, during adsorption and desorption of gaseous species. Density functional theory based calculations provided the mechanistic insights into the interactions between different hybrid networks and gas molecules supporting the experimentally observed results. The studied materials and sensor structures would provide particular advantages in the field of fundamental research, industrial and ecological applications...|$|E

40|$|Wetting steel {{surfaces}} {{with liquid}} aluminum {{without the use}} of flux can be enabled by the presence of a zinc-coating. The mechanisms behind this effect are not yet fully understood. Research results on single aluminum droplets falling on commercial galvanized steel substrates revealed the good wetting capability of zinc coatings independently from the coating type. The final wetting angle and length are apparently linked to the time where zinc is liquefied during its contact with the overheated aluminum melt. This led to the assumption that the interaction is basically a fluid dynamic effect of liquid aluminum getting locally <b>alloyed</b> by <b>zinc.</b> A numerical model was developed to describe the transient behavior of droplet movement and mixing with the liquefied zinc layer to understand the spreading dynamics. The simulations reveal a displacement of the molten zinc after the impact of the droplet, which ultimately leads to an accumulation of zinc in the outer weld toe after solidification. The simulation approach neglects the effect of evaporating zinc, resulting in a slight overestimation of the final droplet width. However, in terms of spreading initiation during the first milliseconds, the simulation is in good correlation with experimental observations and demonstrates the reason for the good wetting in the presence of zinc coatings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Aluminium alloys are alloys {{in which}} {{aluminium}} is the predominant metal. The typical alloying elements copper, magnesium, magnese, silicon, tin and zinc. Al and aluminium alloys {{plays an important}} role in engineering and metallurgy field because of fabrication and formability. TIG welding technique is one of the precise and fastest processes used in aerospace industries, ship industries, automobile industries, nuclear industries and marine industries. TIG welding process is used to analyzed the data and evaluate the influence of input parameters on tensile strength and hardness of aluminium specimen. Welding current, gas flow rate and welding speed are the input parameters which affect output responses of aluminium welded joints. To improve welding quality of aluminum plate pre and post welding precautions must be taken during welding process. TIG welding is a high quality welding process used to weld the aluminium. Welding of AL plate by varying input parameters, the output parameters get studied optimized so that better quality of welded joints will develop. 7005 AL alloy are alloy are <b>alloyed</b> with <b>zinc</b> and have highest strength of any easy weldable aluminium alloy. 7005 aluminium alloy is relatively soft, easily machined, durable, recycle, light weight, ductile and malleable metal with appearance silvery. It is non magnetic and does not easily ignite. Al has about one third density and stiffness of steel. From the literature study, it is found that welding of aluminium is a big challenge by conventional arc welding process. Again repeatability of welding depends on its control on welding speed and other processing parameters. In this work to perform welding of 5 mm thickness 7005 aluminium allo...|$|R
40|$|Silver {{has been}} used since ancient times in the {{fabrication}} of decorative and functional objects because of its working properties and pleasing color and shine. In Europe, however, silver was relatively rare; it was only with the exploitation of mines in the New World that silver became available in large quantities, and the fabrication of things like complete silver services {{for the middle class}} was possible, and affordable. Pure silver is too soft for normal use, and so it is combined or alloyed with another metal for strength. Sterling silver, for example, is 92. 5 % silver and 7. 5 % copper. German silver is <b>alloyed</b> with copper, <b>zinc</b> and nickel. Silver objects are stamped with a hallmark, showing that the metal was assayed for its purity; the hallmark identifies the maker as well. If the object is not sterling but silverplate or electroplate, the hallmark will indicate so. Silver plate is made from a base metal such as copper with a thin coating of silver electrolytically deposited on it. A more durable technique is employed for Sheffield plate, where thin sheets of silver and copper are sandwiched together in a furnace. Like gold leaf, very thin sheets of silver foil can be applied to a variety of surfaces to create a decorative effect.
