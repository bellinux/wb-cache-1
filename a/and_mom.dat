500|$|The {{film was}} at the center of many {{high-profile}} lawsuits and condemnations. The exploitation genre was pitched against numerous challenges during the 1940s and 1950s, and fought many local censorship battles, and fought bitterly against the motion picture censorship system. It has been claimed that nearly 428 lawsuits were laid against both Babb <b>and</b> <b>Mom</b> and Dad during the film's run. [...] Babb often used the supposed educational value of his films as an offer of defense, and recommended such tactic to theater owners in his pressbooks. [...] One successful challenge was in New York City, where Mom and Dad remained censored until 1956, when the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court overturned the ruling of the censorship board, deciding that human birth did not qualify as [...] "indecent".|$|E

500|$|Angelou {{subsequently}} wrote six additional autobiographies, {{covering a}} variety of her young adult experiences. They are distinct in style and narration, but unified in their themes and stretch from Arkansas to Africa, {{and back to the}} US, from the beginnings of World War II to King's assassination. [...] Like Caged Bird, the events in these books are episodic and crafted as a series of short stories, yet do not follow a strict chronology. Later books in the series include Gather Together in My Name (1974), Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas (1976), The Heart of a Woman (1981), All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes (1986), A Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002), <b>and</b> <b>Mom</b> & Me & Mom (2013, at the age of 85).

She is {{best known}} for her first autobiography, the critically acclaimed I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), which was nominated for a National Book Award. [...] Angelou did not write Caged Bird with the intention of writing a series of autobiographies; critics have [...] "judged the subsequent autobiographies in light of the first". Her series also includes Gather Together in My Name (1974), Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas (1976), The Heart of a Woman, (1981), All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes (1986), A Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002), <b>and</b> <b>Mom</b> & Me & Mom (2013).

500|$|To Heart 2 story {{revolves}} around the male protagonist Takaaki Kouno, {{a high school student}} who has an aversion to most girls around him, and focuses on his interactions with his schoolmates.

Because both Dad <b>and</b> <b>Mom</b> left for a business trip today, nobody is home." [...] That morning, Konomi Yuzuhara, Takaaki's childhood friend, comes to meet Takaaki for their commute to school. Konomi is a cheerful and innocent, but childish girl. She is one year younger than Takaaki, who often views her as a younger sister.Translated quote: [...] "As I am an only child, [...] is something like a sister to me." [...] The two are also friends with Yuuji Kousaka, who is in the same class as Takaaki. Despite being the son of a wealthy and prestigious family, Yuuji has a frivolous and carefree personality, and often flirts with the girls at school. Takaaki later [...] reunites with Tamaki Kousaka, another childhood friend, who had promised to return before being enrolled into a boarding school.

500|$|An Unforgettable Summer was {{the first}} major {{production}} to star Scott Thomas, and the last film to star George Constantin (who died soon after). It also featured the critically acclaimed presence of comedian Ioan Gyuri Pascu. Tronaru praises both Bleonţ and Scott Thomas for their performance, while Berardinelli objects to their seeming aloofness, arguing that a connection between the audience and the actors in the main roles could prove [...] "tenuous". In contrast with the latter commentator, Variety notes: [...] "The actress gives a properly flighty dimension to the loving wife <b>and</b> <b>mom</b> whose flair for putting a joyous spin on things is forever impaired by the looming atrocity she feels powerless to halt." [...] Caryn James writes: [...] "An Unforgettable Summer would have been more trenchant if Petre's character had been more fully developed. But Marie-Therese is, deliberately, the apolitical soul of the film, shifting the focus from politics to the humanity that transcends border disputes and ethnic loyalties. Ms. Scott-Thomas makes the film work because she shows Marie-Therese to be something other than a shallow woman playing Lady Bountiful. She is sincere, rather helpless and, finally, shaken with disillusionment. Neither pure heroine nor villain, by the end she is unable to escape the murderous impact of politics." [...] Variety also commends Răzvan Vasilescu for his performance in the role of Colonel Turtureanu, [...] "an opportunistic soldier who has no compunctions about anything the military life may require", and comments favorably on the soundtrack composed by Anton Şuteu and on Paul Bortnovschi's production design.|$|E
