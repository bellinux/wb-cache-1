40|$|Introduction High {{starting}} radioactivity {{is usually}} advantageous for producing radiopharmaceuticals with high specific radioactivity. However, the [11 C]CH 4 yields from N 2 -H 2 gas target fall short from theoretical amounts, as {{calculated from the}} cross section for the well-known 14 N(p,α) 11 C nuclear reaction 1. The beneficial effect of increased target chamber temperature on [11 C]CH 4 yields has recently been brought forward by us 2 and others 3. In addition to the temperature effect, our attention has also been on the hydrogen content factor. This study intends to examine the N 2 -H 2 target performance in a substantially larger target chamber and at higher temperatures than our setup before and compare the results to the existing data.

The SiO bond length determined from SiO molecules isolated in argon is between 148.9 pm and 151 pm. This bond length {{is similar to}} the Si=O double bonds (rSiO = 148 pm) in matrix isolated linear, molecular, SiO2 (O=Si=O), indicative of the absence of a triple bond as in CO.

Neutron Resonance Radiography (NRR) has been under investigation {{as a supplement to}} conventional x-ray systems as a non-invasive, non-destructive means of detecting explosive material in checked luggage. Using fast (1 - 6 MeV) neutrons produced by an accelerator-based D(d,n) 3 He reaction and a scintillator-coupled CCD camera, NRR provides both an imaging capability and the ability to determine the chemical composition of materials in baggage or cargo. Theoretical studies and simulations have shown the potential of NRR. This thesis takes the first step towards experimental implementation using a deuterium target for multiple-element discrimination. A new neutron source has been developed to provide the high-flux neutron beam required for NRR while simultaneously minimizing gamma ray production. The gas target incorporates a 4 atm D 2 gas chamber, separated from the accelerator beamline with thin, 5 [tm tungsten or 7 [im molybdenum foils supported by a honeycomb lattice structure to increase structural integrity and provide a heat removal pathway. An <b>argon</b> gas <b>cooling</b> system is incorporated to cool the target and thus increase the neutron flux. The gas target has been shown to withstand 3. 0 MeV deuteron beam currents in excess of 35 ýLA for extended periods without failure, resulting in a neutron flux of 6. 6 x 107 neutrons/sr/LA/s. A neutron imaging system was designed to detect the fast neutrons and produce a digital image of objects for analysis. (cont.) Two neutron detectors, Eljen plastic scintillator EJ- 200 and a ZnS(Ag) scintillating screen were tested for their suitability to NRR. Although ZnS(Ag) has a lower detection efficiency, its resolution, minimal light dispersion, and insensitivity to gamma rays made it the more favorable material. An Apogee Instruments, Inc., Alta U 9 CCD camera was used to record the light from the scintillator to create radiographs. The gas target and neutron detection system were used to evaluate the results of experimental work to determine the feasibility of NRR. These experiments ultimately indicated that although NRR has promise, significant challenges regarding neutron flux and image processing must be overcome before the technique can be implemented as an explosives detection system. Suggestions are made for improvements. by Whitney Lyke Raas. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Nuclear Science and Engineering, 2007.

40|$|Liquid cryogens, {{released}} and warming to atmosphere conditions, expand to, on average, seven hundred times their liquid volume, and displace vital atmospheric oxygen. An oxygen deficiency hazard analysis assesses the increased {{risk to personnel}} in areas containing cryogenic systems. The D 0 detector platform area ODH analysis has been approached four different ways using established methods. In each case, the analysis shows the platform area to be ODH class 0 as equipped (with ventilation fans) and requiring no special safety provisions. System designers have provided for a reduced oxygen level detection and warning system as well as emergency procedures to address fault conditions. The Oxygen Deficiency Hazard of any particular area is defined by these parameters: {{the nature of the}} accidental supply of inert gas (probability of occurrence and quantity then released), the area's volume, the area's ventilation rate, and to a small degree the elevation of the area. Once this information is assembled, the ODH classification can be determined through standardized calculations. The platform area under the D 0 detector contains much of the cryogenic and gas system piping necessary for the D 0 experiment. Prior to moving the detector into the Collision Hall, the liquid <b>argon</b> calorimeters are <b>cooled</b> down and operated in the Assembly Hall. The first phase of this operation involved the cooldown of the Central Calorimeter, which was done in February 1991. This engineering note assesses the increased risk to personnel in the platform level to a reduced oxygen atmosphere during the cool down and subsequent operation of the calorimeters in the Assembly Hall. In addition, it outlines the steps taken to warn personnel of an emergency and to direct the subsequent evacuation. This note analyses only the Assembly Hall area. A similar engineering note, EN- 332, covers the analysis of the Collision Hall area...|$|R
