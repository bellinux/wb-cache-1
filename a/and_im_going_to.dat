Threet called his former high school coach and left a message saying, [...] "Coach, Im {{going to go back}} to Michigan, <b>and</b> <b>Im</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> beat Ryan Mallett out for that starting job." [...] In a July 2007 interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Threet explained his decision: [...] "The biggest thing is that the two coaches that recruited me took jobs at other schools, and that happened after I got there. People have been asking if it was homesickness, or classes were too hard, or if it was all the competition at Tech. It was not any of those at all. I had a 3.76 grade-point my first semester, and the competition (at Michigan) is as good or better." ...|$|E
5000|$|Following on from Martin Kemps {{decision}} to quit EastEnders, Outhwaite announced she was quitting the soap {{in the autumn}} of 2001, stating, [...] "Im not sure what was left for Mel to do after she had been kidnapped, been married twice, burnt down a club and slept with her best friends husband ... To be honest with you, Mels role in EastEnders has come to a kind of natural end. I always said Id go when I felt that the character had run her course, <b>and</b> <b>Im</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> leave when my contract runs out next year ... Martin and I are in very similar situations with our characters. We came in at a similar time, and now it looks like well leave at a similar time, too. Mel and Steve had some kind of aura, a chemistry, that was unique. I was really proud of it." [...] She added, [...] "Ill always be indebted to EastEnders for providing me with a wonderful start to my career on television and the opportunity to play a character like Mel has been fabulous. I felt {{it was time to move}} on and try on a new coat - new characters, new challenges." [...] EastEnders executive producer John Yorke said of Outhwaites departure, [...] "Tamzin has created one of the most-loved characters and (with Martin Kemp) one half of the most-admired on-screen couple in EastEnders since the show started. She has been fantastic to work with and we wish her all the luck in her career." [...] Yorke added that the character would be welcome back any time.|$|E
5000|$|Francesca Battistelli told CCM Magazines Caroline Lusk that [...] "Ive {{always dreamed}} {{about making a}} Christmas album. It was a blast getting to write the songs, pick the {{standards}} and record them all last summer while I was eight months pregnant. Ha! It really was so much all around. Ian Eskelin, my producer, knocked {{it out of the}} park. The arrangements are exactly what I wanted them to be, and Im so proud of how the record turned out." [...] Furthermore, Battistelli stated that [...] "Its so hard to choose a favorite song from the album! Right now Id say its, [...] "Marshmallow World." [...] Its a more obscure classic, {{so a lot of people}} havent heard it and I love to hear the reactions to such a fun Christmas song. My all-time favorite Christmas song is [...] "Breath of Heaven." [...] It gives me chills every time." [...] On marking Christmas tradition, Battistelli evoked how [...] "We will get to see all our loved ones this year and for that Im so grateful! We are continuing the tradition of touring during the Christmas season <b>and</b> <b>Im</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try an advent calendar with our son and see how he does with it. I loved ours as a kid, and I think it will be a great way to talk about the meaning of Christmas all month long." [...] Lastly, Battistelli touched on Mary the mother of Jesus, when she said [...] "Its really impossible for any of us to fully understand Marys part in the Christmas story from her perspective, but as a mom, I have such deeper insight into how she must have felt than I did before. Did she know that her son was going to change the world? Did she know she would lose him? How much did God reveal to her heart? No matter how much she knew or didnt know, I am just so grateful that she said yes to Gods call on her life. I cant wait to share Jesus with my kids!" ...|$|E

5000|$|In October 2010, Cudi had {{announced}} that he would be forming a rock band with frequent collaborator Dot da Genius, tentatively called Wizard.

5000|$|Schmidt has {{publicly}} expressed {{his thoughts on}} various baseball controversies. He has been a vocal advocate for the reinstatement of Pete Rose to baseball. In July 2005, he appeared on Bob Costas HBO show Costas Now to discuss steroids, and said, [...] "Let me {{go out on a}} limb and say that if I had played during that era I would have taken steroids... We all have these things we deal with in life, <b>and</b> <b>Im</b> surely not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sit here and say to you guys, I wouldnt have done that." [...] In his 2006 book, Clearing the Bases: Juiced Players, Monster Salaries, Sham Records, and a Hall of Famers Search for the Soul of Baseball, he somewhat recanted that statement, saying that he understood the desire to get a competitive advantage even though he could not condone breaking the rules to do so.|$|R
5000|$|Speaking of the {{upcoming}} album to Record Mirrors Ray Fox-Cumming, Harley said: [...] "Quite frankly, Ive always been much bigger as a live performer than I have on plastic. It will probably be my next album release. Basically {{it will be the}} whole of the one-and-a-half hour show I did on the last tour. We recorded the concerts at Glasgow, Birmingham, Newcastle, Hammersmith and The Rainbow, so there are plenty of versions of each song to choose from and make a good album. The results of what has been mixed so far have turned out excellently. I have cheated a little bit, though I think quite justifiably so. I altered the running order a bit, although I dont think that most people who went to the concerts will even notice. The reason for the change is that a running order which seems right for a show can be nonsense on plastic. Each side of each of the two records has to have a beginning and an end, which in all means eight ends-and-beginnings. In concert you dont have that problem. Ive also cheated a tiny amount by erasing the odd bum note. Out of five versions of a song that Ive got to choose from, there will always be one where the vocals in tune, the guitar solo sounds great and everything else is just about perfect, but even then theres always some little thing thats off <b>and</b> <b>Im</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> spoil a good track by allowing an obvious bum note on it when that can be avoided." ...|$|R

Previous X-Men director Bryan Singer declared that The Last Stand [...] "isnt what I would have done" [...] and he was dissatisfied with the busy plot and excessive character deaths, but Singer still liked some parts of the movie, such as Ellen Pages casting - leading Singer to bring her back as Kitty Pryde in X-Men: Days of Future Past - and the scenes with Leech, which he described as [...] "really sweet moments". Matthew Vaughn, who was attached as director before dropping out, criticized Ratners direction: [...] "I could have done something with far more emotion <b>and</b> heart. <b>Im</b> probably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be told off for saying that, but I genuinely believe it." [...] While promoting his own installment of the franchise, 2011s X-Men: First Class, Vaughn would say regarding The Last Stand that [...] "I storyboarded the whole bloody film, did the script. My X3 would have been 40 minutes longer. They didnt let the emotions and the drama play in that film. It became wall-to-wall noise and drama. I would have let it breathe and given far more dramatic elements to it." ...|$|R
