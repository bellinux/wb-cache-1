30|$|<b>A</b> {{semi-active}} <b>schedule</b> often {{occurs in}} decoding <b>a</b> <b>schedule</b> {{and results in}} the increasing of makespan. An active schedule can avoid the weakness. Local left shift and global left shift are designed to decode <b>a</b> <b>schedule</b> to <b>a</b> active one (Li et al. 2010). In this paper, a left-shift function proposed by Li et al. (2010) is applied to decode <b>a</b> semi-active <b>schedule</b> into <b>an</b> active <b>schedule.</b> After applying the left-shift function to the semi-active schedule, the schedule can be decoded as <b>an</b> active <b>schedule.</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} practical {{problem in}} schedule execution is {{the occurrence of}} unforeseen events. Whether we consider <b>a</b> <b>schedule</b> for <b>a</b> Job Shop or a timetable for a school, an unexpected event, such as machine breakdowns or personnel illness, that disrupt {{the execution of the}} schedule will almost certainly occur once in a while. Hence, it becomes important to be able to repair <b>a</b> <b>schedule.</b> When repairing <b>a</b> <b>schedule,</b> it is often important to minimise the difference between the new and the original schedule. Since this minimisation objective is a global objective involving the start times of all operations, repair-based scheduling is much harder than predictive scheduling, i. e., creating <b>an</b> <b>schedule</b> from scratch. In this paper, <b>a</b> new constraint-based <b>scheduling</b> approach for repairing <b>a</b> <b>schedule</b> is proposed. This approach aims at repairing standard Job Shop Scheduling Problems. The approach contains a new constraint-propagation method and a new operation selection heuristic. ...|$|R
