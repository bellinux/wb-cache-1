This research analyses this volume with a view to exploring strategies for its reduction. Statistics were gathered onsite from collision repair centres for the measurement of consumable plastic waste, insurance quote centres for ascertaining the percentages of damaged plastic components replaced, and a steel recycling centre for its volumes of generated <b>automotive</b> <b>plastic</b> waste. A national postal survey directed to head teachers of TAFE panel beating sections explored the present depth of knowledge and skill available on the subject of <b>automotive</b> <b>plastic</b> welding and repair training for the collision repair industry. The research indicated that an improvement in industry training would result in only a modest reduction of the total waste stream but the economic benefits could be considerable. A national training policy aimed at up-skilling the collision repair industry in plastic repair skills could create additional fulltime employment for 200 – 300 personnel and offer ongoing saving on insurance repair costs in the vicinity of 35 million dollars per annum. A literature search produced information for a subjective view on the subject of pyrolysis. Pyrolysis could be one potential methodology capable of converting plastic wastes from landfill to useful by-products such as activated carbons and petrochemicals.

The requirements for the paintings in the automotive industry are evidenced by a list of assays that analyze the structural properties of the product once applied on the plastic component. Note that each automotive group needs a different testing methodology and requirements, and thus validating a product is difficult for several brands. The main objective of this work, identify and validate an assay generic matrix for the development of coatings on <b>automotive</b> <b>plastic</b> components, will be addressed first by the bibliographic study of required assays from the chosen companies to analyse. From this first study, a primary assay matrix containing all existing assays, will be obtained. Using selection criteria, the primary assay matrix will be reduced to one containing the assays to be performed. Once finished the assays, using a system that allows the comparison of the results obtained, the methodology of each assay will be analysed in order to see which is the most severe and therefore the most suitable to form part of an assay generic matrix. That allows performing the validation of a new product for several automotive brands. From the analysis of 8 assays with different methodology, which are common in 12 AkzoNobel's usual automotive market brands, each of them evaluates a different characteristic of the coating.

40|$|Carbon fibres {{are used}} widely as {{reinforcements}} for polymeric matrices in high-tech applications {{by virtue of}} their good mechanical, electrical and thermal properties. Vapour grown carbon fibres (VGCF) are a new type of fibres whose technological applications, namely reinforcements for thermoplastic matrix composites, are yet to be developed. Due to their potentially low cost and high production rates, VGCFs show promising new possibilities in this area. Recently, in industry worldwide, the potential of VGCFs in thermal and electrical applications such as solid-state batteries and electrostatic painting of high volume <b>automotive</b> <b>plastic</b> parts is increasingly being recognised. As a result, easy and non-destructive measurement of thermal and electrical properties of VGCF-based composites has become an important issue for use in industrial applications. In this study the optical beam deflection technique was used for the evaluation of the thermal diffusivity of vapour grown carbon fibres (VGCF) - polymer composites. It is shown that, for low diffusivities, simple approaches such as the “phase method'' or the ``zero crossing method'' are not valid and a multiparameter fitting to the amplitude values has to be used instead. The thermal diffusivity of the composites, measured along the direction of the fibre preferential orientation, increases with fibre content.

40|$|Today’s {{automotive}} {{manufacturing facilities}} use different robotic systems with the specifically designed {{end of arm tooling}} (EOAT). Regardless of how accurate these robotic systems may be, they are programmed {{to repeat the}} same task and move to the same position repeatedly. As convenient as this process may be, it does not allow robots to automatically readjust to different part variations without the human assistance. This situation is especially noticeable in the plastics manufacturing industry, e. g., fuel tank welding. This thesis describes the systematic design methodology of an adaptable tooling system for a part to part variations processing aimed at <b>automotive</b> <b>plastic</b> fuel tank manufacturing. By combining a 3 D vision system with a PLC, and a Fanuc R- 2000 iB/ 165 F 6 axis robot, the system provides the robot with the ability to automatically readjust the processing unit to different part variations. The design approach specifies programming and device correlation by using Siemens S 7, Fanuc TP, and SICK AG software. A case study using a fuel tank sample was developed to check the system for functionality and performance. Results of the study indicate that the system is accurate within ± 0. 25 mm, which is well suited for fuel tank manufacturing. The study signifies a new approach to vision guided robotics (VGR).

40|$|Waste {{electric}} and electronic equipments (WEEE) and <b>automotive</b> <b>plastic</b> shredder contain nitrogen-containing polymers such as polyamides and polyurethanes. Thermal decomposition of these polymers leads to pyrolysis oil in which unwanted N-containing compounds are also present. Catalytic pyrolysis {{can be a}} way to reduce the oil's N-content or to obtain valuable products. We have examined the slow heating rate pyrolysis of zeolite-polyamide and zeolite-polyurethane mixtures by thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry (TG-MS), moreover flash pyrolysis of the mixtures at three different temperatures were carried out by pyrolysis-gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). In TG-MS experiments thermal decomposition characteristics of polyamides are hardly affected by the presence of acidic zeolites, nevertheless, MS ion curves show that the nature of the evolved volatile compounds have changed considerably. Similarly different pyrolysis products have been obtained from pure polyurethanes and polyurethane-zeolite mixtures, but polyurethane-zeolite mixtures have noticeably dissimilar thermal behaviour than the pure polymer. Py-GC/MS measurements have revealed that the pyrolysis temperature significantly affects the pyrolysis product distribution of the investigated polymers and also that of their mixtures with acidic zeolites. For zeolite-polyamide- 6, 6 1 : 1 mixtures it was concluded that hexanedinitrile is the main pyrolysis product and its predominance is the highest at 500 °C. Main pyrolysis products of zeolite-polyamide- 6 mixtures of 1 : 1 ratio are dihydro-azepine isomers. Their amount does not increase over 450 °C, however with rising temperature aromatic compounds are also formed. In case of polyurethane-zeolite mixtures the ether and ester segments are decomposed mainly to monomers, while diisocyanate units are converted to N-containing aromatic compounds. The amount of these compounds is varying with temperature, moreover increasing the pyrolysis temperature (450 °C or higher) the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene and naphthalene compounds) and light unsaturated hydrocarbons are favoured. Flash pyrolysis of polyurethane-NH 4 Y zeolite mixtures indicated that ammonia notably affects the decomposition of polyester segments leading to hexanedinitrile formation at as low temperature as 400 °C. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract Background Endocrine disrupting {{chemicals}} and carcinogens, {{some of which}} may not yet have been classified as such, are present in many occupational environments and could increase breast cancer risk. Prior research has identified associations with breast cancer and work in agricultural and industrial settings. The {{purpose of this study was}} to further characterize possible links between breast cancer risk and occupation, particularly in farming and manufacturing, as well as to examine the impacts of early agricultural exposures, and exposure effects that are specific to the endocrine receptor status of tumours. Methods 1005 breast cancer cases referred by a regional cancer center and 1146 randomly-selected community controls provided detailed data including occupational and reproductive histories. All reported jobs were industry- and occupation-coded for the construction of cumulative exposure metrics representing likely exposure to carcinogens and endocrine disruptors. In a frequency-matched case–control design, exposure effects were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Results Across all sectors, women in jobs with potentially high exposures to carcinogens and endocrine disruptors had elevated breast cancer risk (OR = 1. 42; 95 % CI, 1. 18 - 1. 73, for 10 years exposure duration). Specific sectors with elevated risk included: agriculture (OR = 1. 36; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 1. 82); bars-gambling (OR = 2. 28; 95 % CI, 0. 94 - 5. 53); <b>automotive</b> <b>plastics</b> manufacturing (OR = 2. 68; 95 % CI, 1. 47 - 4. 88), food canning (OR = 2. 35; 95 % CI, 1. 00 - 5. 53), and metalworking (OR = 1. 73; 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 2. 92).
