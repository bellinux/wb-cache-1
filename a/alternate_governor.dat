40|$|Now the ECB {{will become}} {{responsible}} for micro-prudential supervision {{there are consequences}} for its primary mandate. Separating these two tasks may be necessary. Conceptually, both functions are related and a mutual prerequisite in the short- but especially the long-term. However, clear conflicts of interest may arise when the ECB is both bank supervisor and monetary policymaker; we cannot be sure {{which of the two}} functions will prevail. To solve this we need to separate the two functions by either setting up a Supervisory Board, operating independently within the ECB, or by appointing national supervisors as <b>alternates</b> to NCB <b>governors</b> in the Council. In both cases, a member of the ECB’s Executive Board should be responsible for supervision and the ECB should have a new solvency instrument orthogonal to the interest rate, for early intervention in potential problem banks. This is, however, not the ultimate solution to the problem, as ECB president Draghi will be ultimately responsible for both monetary policy and supervision. In the end both should be independent from each other as well as from politics, coupled with clear accountability. Only when supervision is not influenced by politics it can be optimal...|$|R
