Females comprise 49.8 per cent of the population, with a total number of 286, 548. The city has a sex ratio of 101 males for every 100 females, the second highest ratio in the region, after Navotas, which has a sex ratio of 102 males per 100 females. Seven out of ten Valenzuela City residents, 66.7 per cent, belong to the working-age group, or those aged 15 to 64. The remaining 33.3 are aged 0 to below 15 and 65 and above, which are classified <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> age group.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{flag of the}} Nordic {{countries}} is the flag of Denmark with a description dating from 1748. The design has a cross symbol in a rectangular field, with {{the center of the}} cross shifted towards the hoist. This basic design is called Nordic cross and has been adopted by the other Nordic countries Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> territories of Faroe Islands and Åland. Similar flags are also used as regional flags, most prominently the semi-official flag of Scania. The design has also been used outside the Nordic countries in order to underline a cultural connection. Examples are Shetland and Orkney.|$|E
25|$|Different {{choices for}} the frame of {{reference}} and expansion parameters are possible in Stokes-like approaches to the non-linear wave problem. In 1880, Stokes himself inverted the dependent and independent variables, by taking the velocity potential and stream function as the independent variables, and the coordinates (x,z) <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> variables, with x and z being the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively. This has the advantage that the free surface, in a frame of reference in which the wave is steady (i.e. moving with the phase velocity), corresponds with a line on which the stream function is a constant. Then the free surface location is known beforehand, and not an unknown part of the solution. The disadvantage is that the radius of convergence of the rephrased series expansion reduces.|$|E

500|$|An early {{interpretation}} of the film uses dream analysis to explain that the first part is a dream of the real Diane Selwyn, who has cast her dream-self as the innocent and hopeful [...] "Betty Elms", reconstructing her history and persona into something like an old Hollywood film. In the dream, Betty is successful, charming, and lives the fantasy life of a soon-to-be-famous actress. The last one-fifth of the film presents Diane's real life, in which she has failed both personally and professionally. She arranges for Camilla, an ex-lover, to be killed, and unable {{to cope with the}} guilt, re-imagines her <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dependent,</b> pliable amnesiac Rita. Clues to her inevitable demise, however, continue to appear throughout her dream.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the above-mentioned forms, Old Irish also has one dependent verb form that is neither a regular conjunct form nor a prototonic form: the word [...] functions in many cases <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> equivalent of [...] "is", e.g. [...] "there is no part", where [...] follows the conjunct particle [...] "not".

30|$|In this study, the {{variables}} were screened in 12 experimental runs with the foldover augmenting method {{to increase the}} resolution of the design in addition to 6 runs at the center points, giving a total of 30 experimental runs.

2500|$|Stative verbs are verbs that do {{not imply}} willful control of the action by its subject. They tend to be intransitive and the subject tends to be marked by the absolutive case. One group of stative verbs, called [...] "direct impersonbal verbs" [...] by Haas, use the object prefixes to mark the subject, and another group, [...] "indirect impersonal verbs", use the prefixes that are {{otherwise}} {{used to refer to}} indirect objects or benefactives. There are a few transitive stative verbs such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> verb [...] "to be tired of something".|$|E

The decision as to which variable in a data set is modeled <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> variable and which are modeled as the independent variables may {{be based on a}} presumption that the value of one of the variables is caused by, or directly influenced by the other variables. Alternatively, there may be an operational reason to model one of the variables in terms of the others, in which case there need be no presumption of causality.|$|E
2500|$|To make {{it easier}} for animals, young children, and {{individuals}} with classical (Kanner-type) autism to understand and perform theory of mind tasks, researchers have developed tests in which verbal communication is de-emphasized: [...] some whose administration does not involve verbal communication {{on the part of the}} examiner, some whose successful completion does not require verbal communication on the part of the subject, and some that meet both of the foregoing standards. [...] One category of tasks uses a preferential looking paradigm, with looking time <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> variable. For instance, 9-month-old infants prefer looking at behaviors performed by a human hand over those made by an inanimate hand-like object. Other paradigms look at rates of imitative behavior, the ability to replicate and complete unfinished goal-directed acts, and rates of pretend play.|$|E

60|$|A man {{of liberal}} education, {{but with an}} income only just {{sufficient}} to enable him to associate in the rank of gentlemen, must feel absolutely certain that if he marries and has a family he shall be obliged, if he mixes at all in society, to rank himself with moderate farmers and the lower class of tradesmen. The woman that a man of education would naturally make {{the object of his}} choice would be one brought up in the same tastes and sentiments with himself and used to the familiar intercourse of a society totally different from that to which she must be reduced by marriage. Can a man consent to place the object of his affection in a situation so discordant, probably, to her tastes and inclinations? Two or three steps of descent in society, particularly at this round of the ladder, where education ends and ignorance begins, will not be considered by the generality of people as a fancied and chimerical, but a real and essential evil. If society be held desirable, it surely must be free, equal, and reciprocal society, where benefits are conferred as well as received, and not such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> finds with his patron or the poor with the rich.|$|E

Ordinal {{logistic regression analysis}} takes into account potential confounders of the association between two cohorts: the independent variables and <b>the</b> end result (<b>dependent</b> variable), with <b>the</b> measure of association being the odds ratio [42]. In this study, random effects include the patients and the radiologists {{participating in the study}} while the independent variables are the scan protocols and the radiation dose administered <b>as</b> <b>the</b> DLP. <b>The</b> <b>dependent</b> variable is <b>the</b> rating scores <b>as</b> an indication of image quality. The ordinal logistic regression model (proportional odds model) is the appropriate model for analysing rating scores since these are ordinal categorical responses.|$|R
