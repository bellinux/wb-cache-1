40|$|Objectives: This study {{investigates the}} effects on aortic {{stiffness}} and vasodilation by <b>arotinolol</b> and the underlying mechanisms in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Methods: The vasodilations of rat aortas, renal and mesenteric arteries were evaluated by isometric force recording. Nitric oxide (NO) was measured in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) by fluorescent probes. Sixteen-week old SHRs were treated with metoprolol (200 mg?kg- 1 ?d- 1), <b>arotinolol</b> (30 mg?kg- 1 ?d- 1) for 8 weeks. Central arterial pressure (CAP) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were evaluated via catheter pressure transducers. Collagen was assessed by immunohisto-chemistry and biochemistry assay, while endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and eNOS phosphorylation (p-eNOS) of HAECs or aortas were analyzed by western blotting. Results: <b>Arotinolol</b> relaxed vascular rings and the relaxations were attenuated by Nv-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, NO synthase inhibitor) {{and the absence of}} endothelium. Furthermore, arotinolol-induced relaxations were attenuated by 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP, Kv channels blocker). <b>Arotinolol</b> produced more nitric oxide compared to metoprolol and increased the expression of p-eNOS in HAECs. These results indicated that arotinolol-induced vasodilation involves endothelium-derived NO and Kv channels. The treatement with <b>arotinolol</b> in 8 weeks, but not metoprolol, markedly decreased CAP and PWV. Biochemistry assay and immunohistochemistry showed that aortic collagen depositions in the <b>arotinolol</b> groups wer...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the preventive effect of nitrate tolerance between carvedilol with antioxidant properties and <b>arotinolol</b> without antioxidant properties. Background. The attenuation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production due to inactivation of guanylate cyclase by increased superoxide has been reported as a mechanism of nitrate tolerance. Carvedilol has been known to combine alpha- and beta-blockade with antioxidant properties. Methods. To evaluate the preventive effect of nitrate tolerance, 24 patients with untreated hypertension were randomized to receive either carvedilol (10 mg twice a day [carvedilol group, n = 8]), <b>arotinolol</b> (10 mg twice a day [arotinolol group, n = 8]), or placebo (placebo group, n = 8). Vasodilatory response to nitroglycerin (NTG) was assessed with forearm plethysmography by measuring the change in forearm blood flow (FBF) before and 5 min after sublingual administration of 0. 3 mg NTG, {{and at the same time}} blood samples were taken from veins on the opposite side to measure platelet cGMP. Plethysmography and blood sampling were obtained serially at baseline (day 0), 3 days after carvedilol, <b>arotinolol</b> or placebo administration (day 3) and 3 days after application of a 20 mg/ 24 h NTG tape concomitantly with carvedilol, <b>arotinolol</b> or placebo (day 6). Results. There was no significant difference in the response of FBF (%FBF) and cGMP (%cGMP) to sublingual administration of NTG on days 0 and 3 among the three groups. On day 6, %FBF and %cGMP were significantly lower in the <b>arotinolol</b> group and the placebo group than days 0 and 3, but these parameters in the carvedilol group were maintained. Conclusions. The results indicated that carvedilol with antioxidant properties may prevent the development of nitrate tolerance during continuous therapy with NTG compared with <b>arotinolol</b> without antioxidant properties...|$|E

40|$|Haemodynamically, the {{combination}} of alpha 1 - and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists is a logical one. alpha 1 -Adrenoceptor blockade causes vasodilatation and hence counteracts elevated peripheral vascular resistance, the most consistent haemodynamic derangement in established essential hypertension. beta-Blockers, which lower elevated blood pressure by a different (not yet clearly understood) mechanism, suppress the reflex tachycardia triggered by vasodilatation. Combined alpha/beta-adrenoceptor blockade {{can be obtained by}} the simultaneous administration of both types of adrenoceptor antagonists, but also by giving drugs that possess alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity in the same molecule. Carvedilol and labetalol are the best known examples of such combined alpha/beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, although their pharmacodynamic profile is a result of different receptor selectivity of their component stereoisomers, rather than combined alpha/beta-blocking activity in a single chemical entity. Both compounds have been investigated clinically in the treatment of essential hypertension in moderate-to-large scale trials. A few newer combined alpha/beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as amosulalol, <b>arotinolol</b> and medroxalol have been developed, but clinical data on these compounds are relatively scarc...|$|E

Human plasma was spiked with stock solution of <b>arotinolol</b> enantiomers and labetalol as the internal standard. The assay involved the use of liquid-liquid extraction procedure with ethyl ether under alkaline condition for human plasma sample prior to HPLC analysis. Recoveries for S-(+) - and R-(-) -arotinolol enantiomers were in the range 93 - 103 % at 200 - 1400 ng/mL level. Intra-day and inter-day precision calculated as %RSD was in the ranges 1. 3 - 3. 4 and 1. 9 - 4. 5 % for both enantiomers, respectively. Intra-day and inter-day accuracies calculated as percentage error were in the ranges 1. 2 - 3. 5 and 1. 5 - 6. 2 % for both enantiomers, respectively. Linear calibration curves in the concentration range 100 - 1500 ng/mL for each enantiomer showed a correlation coefficient (r) of 0. 9998.

40|$|Essential tremor (ET) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{movement}} disorders of adults, characterized by postural and kinetic tremor. It often causes embarrassment and more rarely serious disability, requiring treatment. To assess the current state of knowledge on ET therapy and produce recommendations based on the analysis of evidence the authors reviewed the literature regarding pharmacologic and surgical therapies, providing a quality assessment of the studies and the strength of recommendations for each treatment. A committee of experts selected clinical-based questions to guide the search. A systematic literature review was performed to identify all the studies conducted on patients with ET published until September 2010. Articles were classified according to GRADE evidence profile, a system for grading the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation based on the quality of the studies. The quality of evidence was often rated as "low" or "very low" for the studies analyzed. Propranolol, long-acting propranolol, primidone, and topiramate are recommended as first-line therapy, with restrictions for their side effects. <b>Arotinolol,</b> sotalol, ICI 118. 551 and LI 32. 468 (experimental drugs), zonisamide, gabapentin, alprazolam, clozapine, and olanzapine are recommended as a second-line treatment. Botulinum toxin type A and thalamic deep-brain stimulation are recommended for refractory ET. The results highlight the need of well-designed direct comparison trials aimed at evaluating relative effectiveness and safety of the drugs currently used in clinical practice. Furthermore, additional controlled clinical trials are required to define other possible treatment strategies for ameliorating the management of ET.

40|$|The {{effects of}} nadolol (Nad), {{indenolol}} (Idn), metoprolol (Met), pindolol (Pid), <b>arotinolol</b> (Art, S- 596), and propranolol (Prp) on the cardiovascular system were studied noninvasively in healthy male volunteers. Exercise testing. with a bicycle ergometer was performed {{both before and}} after single oral administration of these β-blockers, and any changes in the exercise induced increase in heart rate systolic blood pressure product (ΔDP) were studied. Systolic time intervals were measured from the simultaneous recording of carotid pulse, phonocardiogram, and electrocardiogram at rest. Left ventricular dimensions were measured by echocardiography, and ejection fraction (EF), stroke index (SI), and cardiac index (CI) were calculated by the standard techniques. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was computed from these data. ΔDP was decreased with all β-blockers. According to the degree of this effect, the relative potency of these drugs was estimated to be as follows: Pid > Art> Idn≒Prp> Nad ≒ Met. The ratio of pre-ejection period to left ventricular ejection time was increased with all β-blockers. EF, SI, and CI were decreased by all β-blockers except Pid, by which SI and CI were kept almost unchanged, and EF was significantly increased. Therefore, Pid was thought to be less cardiosuppressive than the other β-blockers. SVR was significantly decreased by Pid, while it was increased by all the other β-blockers. These results suggest that the acute hemodynamic response to β-blockers is determined primarily by the property of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Neither β 1 -selectivity nor membrane stabilizing effect was shown to be a major factor modifying the central or peripheral hemodynamic response to β-blockers. rights ：日本臨床薬理学会rights ：本文データは学協会の許諾に基づきJournal archiveから複製したものであ...|$|E
40|$|PhDThe {{thesis is}} devoted to {{developing}} new methods for separation and determination of certain cardiovascular drugs by HPLC techniques and chiral stationary phases. These drugs are bufuralol, bisoprolol, betaxolol, <b>arotinolol,</b> and clenbuterol. The developed methods were applied for determination of these drugs in human plasma and in pharmaceutical products. The principles of the proposed procedures {{as well as the}} experimental parameters were studied, discussed, explained and the data obtained were statistically analyzed. The different experimental parameters that affected the development and the stability of the enantiomers were carefully studied. The results were statistically analyzed. The thesis is divided into six main parts: Part I: This part presents a general introduction about chirality and its major role in biological processes, the importance of chiral separations, the development of methods for enantiomers separation. It includes an overview on various chiral separation principles on chiral stationary phases with emphasis on macrocyclic antibiotic and polysaccharide chiral phases. Moreover, it involves an overview on the chiral separations of beta-blocker drugs and its significance. Part II: In this part, a sensitive and selective chiral HPLC method for separation and determination of bufuralol enantiomers in human plasma and in pharmaceutical formulations was developed. The method was based on the resolution of bufuralol enantiomers on vancomycin chiral stationary phase and mobile phase composed of methanol: acetic acid: triethylamine (100 : 0. 015 : 0. 010, v/v/v) with a flow rate of 0. 5 ml/min and UV detection at 254 nm. Part III. 1 : This part describes a chiral HPLC method for separation and determination of bisoprolol enantiomers in human plasma. The method was based on the resolution of bisoprolol enantiomers on teicoplanin chiral stationary phase and mobile phase composed of methanol: acetic acid:triethylamine (100 : 0. 020 : 0. 025, v/v/v) with a flow rate of 1. 5 ml/min and FL detection at 275 nm for excitation and 305 nm for emission. The method was linear in the range of 20 - 200 ng/ml in plasma samples. Also, the developed method has provided a good sensitivity, accuracy and precision. Part III. 2 : In this part, a selective chiral HPLC method for separation and determination of bisoprolol enantiomers in pharmaceutical products was developed. The resolution of the bisoprolol enantiomers was achieved on teicoplanin chiral stationary phase and mobile phase composed of methanol: acetic acid:triethylamine (100 : 0. 020 : 0. 025, v/v/v) with a flow rate of 1. 5 ml/min and FL detection at 275 nm for excitation and 305 nm for emission. The stability of bisoprolol enantiomers at different degrees of temperature was studied. Part IV. 1 : This part presents a sensitive chiral HPLC method for separation and determination of betaxolol enantiomers in human plasma. The method was based on the resolution of betaxolol enantiomers on teicoplanin chiral stationary phase and mobile phase composed of methanol: acetic acid:triethylamine (100 : 0. 020 : 0. 025, v/v/v) with a flow rate of 1. 5 ml/min and FL detection at 275 nm for excitation and 305 nm for emission. The method was linear in the range of 10 - 500 ng/ml in plasma samples. The results obtained were in good agreement with those obtained with the reference methods. Part IV. 2 : This part describes a highly selective chiral HPLC method for separation and determination of betaxolol enantiomers in pharmaceutical products. The method was based on the resolution of betaxolol enantiomers on teicoplanin chiral stationary phase. The mobile phase was composed of methanol: acetic acid:triethylamine (100 : 0. 020 : 0. 025, v/v/v) with a flow rate of 1. 5 ml/min and FL detection at 275 nm for excitation and 305 nm for emission. The method was linear in the range of 10 - 500 ng/ml in standard solution samples. The method also proved to be accurate, precise, and robust. Part V: In this part, an enantioselective stability-indicating HPLC method was developed for the analysis of <b>arotinolol</b> in human plasma and in pharmaceutical formulations. The degradation behavior of <b>arotinolol</b> was investigated under different stress conditions recommended by ICH. Resolution of the drug and complete separation from its degradation products are successfully achieved on Chirobiotic V column, mobile phase composed of methanol : glacial acetic acid : triethylamine, 100 : 0. 020 : 0. 030, (v/v/v), a flow rate of 1 ml/min and UV detector set at 315 nm. The drug was found to degrade in alkaline, acidic, oxidative conditions and when exposed to heat. The drug was stable to sunlight. The method has also been successfully applied to human plasma and to pharmaceutical formulations. The method was highly specific, where the degradation products and the coformulated compounds did not interfere. Part VI: This part presents an enantioselective HPLC method that enabled direct separation and determination of clenbuterol enantiomers in plasma and in pharmaceutical formulations using cellulose ester polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phase. Enantiomeric resolution was achieved with a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile: 0. 3 M sodium perchlorate, (16 %: 84 %), (v/v), flow rate of 0. 9 ml/min and UV detection set at 247 nm. The stability of clenbuterol enantiomers at different temperature degrees was studied. The standard calibration curves were linear over the range of 0. 5 - 50 μg/ml. The mean RSD of the results of within-day precision and accuracy of the drug were ≤ 6 %. In all parts, the results obtained were statistically analyzed.

40|$|Study I: This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} whether non-invasive assessment of cardiovascular system discriminates white coat hypertension (WCH). The major reason is the high prevalence of WCH in these subjects and it remains uncertain whether WCH is associated with cardiovascular risk. Women were required to be naturally menopausal; at least 1 year, but not greater than 5 years, past their menstrual period. Exclusion criteria were past history of preeclampsia or eclampsia, severe illness such as myocardial infarction and stroke within 6 months, having used estrogens or progestins within 3 months, being treated with antihypertensive agents or with non pharmacological therapy such as reduction of daily salt, and proteinuric nephropathy. In addition, secondary hypertension was excluded as possible. WCH was defined if subjects who had BP more than 150 / 90 mmHg at office had to have both mean systolic and diastolic pressures below 120 / 80 mmHg at home. Forty-four subjects, mean age 52 years, recruited from the outpatients clinic, were examined. BPs at office and home, pulse wave velocity (PWV), and augmentation index (Aix) were recorded. Left ventricular diameter, septal wall thickness, and left posterior wall thickness were assessed by M-mode echocardiography after selecting the measurement section by B-mode echocardiography. Twenty patients were diagnosed as having WCH based on the criteria in the trial. We found that the patterns of pulse wave were different between subjects with WCH and those with hypertension. The most prominent difference was the levels of Aix. In subjects with WCH, Aixs were 25. 6 ± 3. 8 compared to 38. 6 ± 4. 5 mmHg in those with hypertension. Moreover, PWV of subjects with WCH were 6. 05 ± 0. 53 and those of with hypertension were 8. 45 ± 0. 72 m/sec (p＜ 0. 01). In addition to these findings, {{there was a significant}} association between the values of home systolic BP but not those of office systolic BP and PWV, Aix and LV mass index. When we combined the data of LV mass index and Aix, white coat hypertension was easily segregated from hypertension. The combination of self BP monitoring, echocardiographic data and Aix and PWV would be powerful indicators for treatment of hypertension in postmenopausal women. Study II: To assess the efficacy of the various classes of antihypertensive drugs in postmenopausal women with hypertension. Women were required to be naturally menopausal; at least 1 year, but not greater than 5 years, past their menstrual period. Exclusion criteria were past history of preeclampsia or eclampsia, severe illness such as myocardial infarction and stroke within 6 months, having used estrogens or progestins within 3 months, and proteinuric nephropathy as well as surgically menopausal. 114 women who participated in this study after informed consent were obtained. These women were diagnosed as having hypertension based on BP of more than 140 / 90 mmHg at clinic as well as on self-reported BP of more than 130 / 85 mmHg at home. If both levels of BP were not satisfied with the criteria, such patients were also excluded. All antihypertensive medications were withdrawn 6 weeks before the initiation of the study. All patients were randomly assigned in equal numbers to the following therapeutic groups; A) losartan, 50 mg daily and trichlormethiazide 2 mg twice a week and B) cilnidipine, a calcium channel blocker, 5 mg and <b>arotinolol,</b> an αβ blocker, 10 mg daily. Three groups were retrospectively segregated according to pulse pressure (PP) {{at the start of the}} study: Group I (n＝ 24); more than 65 mmHg: Group II (n＝ 58); below 64 to more than 45 mmHg and Group III (n＝ 32); below 44 mmHg. In Group I, combination therapy with B) reduced systolic BP much more compared to that with A) (169 ± 2 / 88 ± 5 to 133 ± 2 / 73 ± 5 vs 169 ± 2 / 88 ± 5 to 149 ± 2 / 66 ± 5 mmHg, p＜ 0. 05). On the other hand, in Group III, A) decreased diastolic BP as well as systolic BP (152 ± 2 / 106 ± 2 to 123 ± 1 / 78 ± 1 vs 149 ± 2 / 107 ± 2 to 129 ± 2 / 84 ± 1 mmHg, p＜ 0. 05). In Group II, there was no significant difference between two antihypertensive regimens. Other three biological markers were not influenced by any type of treatment. PP before starting medication of hypertension may be useful for the choice of antihypertensive drugs. Combining these two studies, it is suggested that evaluation and treatment of hypertensive postmenopausal women would be much more investigated than previously and be needed much work to be carried out...|$|E
