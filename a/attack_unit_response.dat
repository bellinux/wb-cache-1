Putting {{forward the}} straight-line {{trajectory}} of MEFP （multi-explosively formed penetrators, also called <b>attack</b> <b>unit</b> ） {{in the target}} coordinate by means of building ground coordinate and target coordinate and the conversion of ground coordinate to target coordinate in the Area Blank off Weapon System. According to the intersection criterion {{that there are only}} two points between the <b>attack</b> <b>unit</b> straight-line trajectory and the cylindrical surface of the target, whether <b>attack</b> <b>unit</b> hits the target or not is decided. The intersection criterion is applied on the simulation of all kinds of different distributed plans...|$|R

50|$|Combat itself {{takes the}} form of one unit {{directly}} engaging another, without outside interference from any other units which might be in the area. The <b>attacking</b> <b>unit</b> always fires first. If the defending unit is still alive following the first strike, it will retaliate against the <b>attacking</b> <b>unit.</b> Each <b>unit</b> can only <b>attack</b> once per turn and retaliate once per turn, unless a sidebar power enables another attack. Air attacks are always retaliated against, provided that the unit has an anti-air score and will not get killed by the air <b>unit's</b> <b>attack</b> first.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The ANN methodology, {{inspired}} by neurobiology theories of massive interconnection and parallelism {{has been successfully}} employed in variety of optimization problems. In ground water management models, either governing equations are embedded into the management model or <b>unit</b> <b>response</b> matrixes are employed. <b>Unit</b> <b>response</b> matrixes development requires huge amount of data and/or simulation runs. In this paper, ANN is employed to develop <b>unit</b> <b>response</b> matrix coefficients to be later used in the management model. To do it, a ANN model has been trained to predict {{the outcome of the}} flow code, which results in <b>unit</b> <b>response</b> matrix coefficients for the aquifer under consideration. To train the ANN model different realizations from pumping well co-ordinates, distance between pumping and observation wells, and hydraulic conductivities of pumping wells were used, it was concluded that pumping well co-ordinates may be successfully employed for developing <b>unit</b> <b>response</b> matrix coefficients to be later used in management models. To test the performance of the proposed approach, the hypothetical aquifer was assumed. The aquifer response to different pumping stresses were compared using a well-defined simulation model and those resulted from <b>unit</b> <b>response</b> matrixes developed by (1) ANN approach and (2) direct data from groundwater simulation runs. It was concluded that ANN may be successfully employed for development of <b>unit</b> <b>response</b> matrix with limited data from field study or ground water simulation runs...|$|R

5000|$|If {{the defender}} is eliminated, victorious <b>attacking</b> <b>units</b> may advance after combat into the hex.

There is no limit to the number of armour units which may stack on or attack from the original breakthrough hex, provided the overstack is rectified {{by the end of the}} turn. Breakthrough against an empty enemy-controlled hex is not allowed, but a key position can be attacked by obtaining an overstacked armoured breakthrough against a weakly held hex adjacent to it.|$|R
