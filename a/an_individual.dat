40|$|We are {{interested}} in the antecedents to <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> decision to become an entrepreneur. Our approach is to consider <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> choice between self-employment and becoming an employee using multi-attribute utility discrete-choice modeling. The attributes in the model are based on the economic factors as previously identified in the entrepreneurship literature, with <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> utility function based on their preferences for income, risk exposure, work effort, independence and ownership (entrepreneurial attitudes). Our point of departure is to use market simulation techniques developed in marketing, to study <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> intention to become self employed by explicitly relating <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> beliefs concerning feasible employment options (their choice set) to their perceived abilities (self-efficacy).

Empirically, we apply an instrumental variables approach to PISA data and find that having an entrepreneurial peer group has {{a positive effect on}} <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> entrepreneurial intentions.

5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> will look to the next level. Realizing {{the limitations of the}} current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E

50|$|The Alcohol Timeline Followback Method (TLFB) {{is a tool}} {{developed}} in 1970 by Linda Carter Sobell and Mark B. Sobell used to assess <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> alcohol intake. It evaluates <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> daily drinking and then provides a report of <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> drinking pattern. Along with this, it looks at the magnitude and variability of drinking. With the timeline summary, it provides a relatively accurate portrayal of one’s drinking.|$|R
5|$|Alcoholism is characterised by an {{increased}} tolerance to alcohol–which means that <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> can consume more alcohol–and physical dependence on alcohol, {{which makes it}} hard for <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed mood is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the social}} {{learning}} theory (more recently expanded as social cognitive theory), behavioural change is determined by environmental, personal, and behavioural elements. Each factor affects each of the others. For example, in congruence {{with the principles of}} self-efficacy, <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> thoughts affect their behaviour and <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> characteristics elicit certain responses from the social environment. Likewise, <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> environment affects the development of personal characteristics as well as the person's behavior, and <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> behaviour may change their environment as well as the way the individual thinks or feels. Social learning theory focuses on the reciprocal interactions between these factors, which are hypothesised to determine behavioral change.|$|R

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>individual</b> mandate {{coupled with}} {{subsidies}} for private insurance {{as a means}} for universal healthcare was considered the best way to win the support of the Senate because it had been included in prior bipartisan reform proposals. The concept goes back to at least 1989, when the conservative The Heritage Foundation proposed <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care. It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of free rider problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.|$|E
