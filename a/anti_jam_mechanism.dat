40|$|Abstract — FH {{communication}} is {{a branch of}} spread spectrum communication for its outstanding advantages of strong <b>anti</b> <b>jamming</b> and antimultipath fading. It is widely used in military and civilian applications for its well performances [9]. In FH communication system, FH (Frequency hopping) sequences are used to hop the frequencies for transmission and {{play an important role}} [6]. A new construction of frequency hopping (FH) sequenced are designated as quadratic prime codes by expanding the construct idea of prime codes to the extension Galois fields GF (P 2). More families of FH sequences with minimal hamming auto correlation and cross correlation properties are desired to improve the performance and security of communication system. Quadratic prime codes can provide P- 1 / 2 families of FH sequenced rather than one family for prime coded for certain prime number P, which is preferable to improve the security of communication system. A modified Bluetooth FH system is built based on quadratic prime code in Mat lab/simulation platform...|$|R

40|$|Severe shield jamming {{events have}} been {{reported}} during excavation of Uluabat tunnel through adverse geological conditions, which resulted in several stoppages at advancing a single shielded tunnel boring machine (TBM). To study the <b>jamming</b> <b>mechanism,</b> three-dimensional (3 D) simulation of the machine and surrounding ground was implemented using the finite difference code FLAC 3 D. Numerical analyses were performed for three sections along the tunnel with a higher risk for entrapment due to the combination of overburden and geological conditions.

Furthermore, they allow realistically assessing the impact of adverse geological conditions on shield jamming. The calculated thrust forces, which are required to move the machine forward, are in good agreement with field observations and measurements. It also proves that the numerical analysis can effectively be used for evaluating the effect of adverse geological environment on TBM entrapments and can be applied to prediction of loads on the shield and pre-estimating of the required thrust force during excavation through adverse ground conditions...|$|R

At present, {{methods of}} the {{navigation}} and the attitude measurements of projectile utilizing the magnetic fields are facing the interference from the BMF (background magnetic field).

On this basis, numerical simulation is conducted combining with projectile's flight rules. The results show that the influence of attitude angle measuring precisions caused by the background interference magnetic field are much bigger than the errors caused by the sensor noise and the established compensation model has obvious effect. Besides, the effective BMF compensation of geomagnetic measurements on the projectile must be conducted if the attitude angle measurement error is in requirements within ± 1 °...|$|R

30|$|The work in {{this paper}} is about to detect and {{classify}} jamming attacks in 802.11 b wireless networks. The number of jamming detection and classification techniques has been proposed in the literature. Majority of them model individual parameters like signal strength, carrier sensing time, and packet delivery ratio to detect {{the presence of a}} jammer and to classify the jamming attacks. The demonstrated results by the authors are often overlapping as most of the jamming regions are closely marked, and they do not help to clearly distinguish different <b>jamming</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> We investigate a multi-modal scheme that models different jamming attacks by discovering the correlation between three parameters: packet delivery ratio, signal strength variation, and pulse width of the received signal. Based on that, profiles are generated in normal scenarios during training sessions which are then compared with test sessions to detect and classify jamming attacks. Our proposed model helps in clearly differentiating the jammed regions for various types of jamming attacks. In addition, it is equally effective for both the protocol-aware and protocol-unaware jammers. The reported results are not based on simulations, but a test-bed was established to experiment real scenarios demonstrating significant enhancements in previous results reported in the literature.|$|R

We use OPNET 10. 0 to simulate various types of jamming which we propose. Intelligent jamming, which jams with the knowledge of the protocol, is shown to perform significantly better than the trivial continuous high power noise jamming while also retaining its effectiveness.
