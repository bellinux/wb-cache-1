25|$|An {{influential}} cognitive-behavioral {{approach to}} addiction recovery and therapy has been Alan Marlatt's (1985) Relapse Prevention approach. Marlatt describes four psychosocial processes {{relevant to the}} addiction and relapse processes: self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> causality, and decision-making processes. Self-efficacy refers to one's ability to deal competently and effectively with high-risk, relapse-provoking situations. Outcome expectancies refer to an individual's expectations about the psychoactive effects of an addictive substance. <b>Attributions</b> <b>of</b> causality refer to an individual's pattern of beliefs that relapse to drug use {{is a result of}} internal, or rather external, transient causes (e.g., allowing oneself to make exceptions when faced with what are judged to be unusual circumstances). Finally, decision-making processes are implicated in the relapse process as well. Substance use is the result of multiple decisions whose collective effects result in consumption of the intoxicant. Furthermore, Marlatt stresses some decisions—referred to as apparently irrelevant decisions—may seem inconsequential to relapse, but may actually have downstream implications that place the user in a high-risk situation.|$|E

25|$|The {{difficulty}} in making confident <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> work by Giorgione's hand dates from {{soon after his}} death, when some of his paintings were completed by other artists, and his considerable reputation also led to very early erroneous claims of attribution. The vast bulk of documentation for paintings in this period relates to large commissions for Church or government; the small domestic panels {{that make up the}} bulk of Giorgione's oeuvre are always far less likely to be recorded. Other artists continued to work in his style for some years, and probably by the mid-century deliberately deceptive work had started.|$|E
25|$|In New York he was {{steeped in}} the artistic and social ferment of the WPA period. He {{exhibited}} in the Bonestell and ACA galleries, and his early circle of friends, with whom he exchanged paintings and drawings, included the painters David Burliuk, Pavel Tchelitchew, Walter Houmère, Rufino Tamayo and Mario Carreño and (later) Edward Laning. Far from setting out to become a ‘Dominican’ painter, he felt himself {{to be part of}} a broader tradition. Here a key influence was his mentor, the Dominican art historian and musicologist Américo Lugo Romero. With Lugo he spent almost every day of the better part of a year in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, absorbing his mentor's working connoisseurship of Renaissance art as the two discussed and challenged <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> paintings.|$|E

25|$|On 3 July, the Romanian Parliament, at the {{proposal}} of majority represented by Social Liberal Union, voted {{the dismissal of}} President of the Senate and President of the Chamber of Deputies. Through an Emergency Ordinance, the government restricted the <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> the Constitutional Court, restoring them to the 2010 status. Likewise, USL leaders Victor Ponta and Crin Antonescu started procedures to dismiss President Traian Băsescu. These measures irritated the international politicians which expressed concerns over the state of democracy {{and the rule of}} law in Romania. On 6 July, Băsescu was suspended after the impeachment motion filed by the ruling coalition passed the Parliament's vote. The motion passed with 256 votes, 39 more than the minimum required. USL leaders argued their action by saying that President Traian Băsescu has breached the Constitution and overstepped his authority.|$|E
500|$|In his 2001 {{catalogue}} raisonné, Slive attributes 694 {{paintings to}} Ruisdael and lists another 163 paintings with dubious or, he believes, incorrect attribution. There are three main reasons {{why there is}} uncertainty over whose hand painted various Ruisdael-style landscapes. Firstly, {{four members of the}} Ruysdael family were landscapists with similar signatures, some of which were later fraudulently altered into Jacob's. This is further {{complicated by the fact that}} Ruisdael used variations of his signature. This typically reads [...] "JvRuisdael" [...] or the monogram [...] "JVR", sometimes using a small italic 's' and sometimes a Gothic long 's', such as on Landscape with Waterfall. Secondly, many 17th century landscape paintings are unsigned and could be from pupils or copyists. Finally, fraudsters imitated Ruisdaels for financial gain, with the earliest case reported by Houbraken in 1718: a certain Jan Griffier the Elder could imitate Ruisdael's style so well that he often sold them for real Ruisdaels, especially with figurines added in the style of the artist Wouwerman. There is no large-scale systematic approach to ascertaining Ruisdael's attributions, unlike the forensic science used to find the correct <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> Rembrandt's paintings through the Rembrandt Research Project.|$|E
500|$|On 14 August 1968 Lihau {{was named}} First President {{of the new}} Supreme Court of Justice of the Congo. He was officially {{installed}} in the position on 23 November. In his inaugural speech, Lihau requested [...] "the scrupulous respect of all the authorities of the Republic {{the status of the}} magistracy guaranteeing independence in the exercise of its functions." [...] Two years later he became editor of the new law journal La Revue Congolaise de Droit and also served as general delegate to the Office Nationale de la Recherche et du Developpement for its judicial, political, and social research division. Marcel Lihau soon adopted the name Ebua Libana la Molengo Lihau, as per the encouraged Africanisation in accordance with Mobutu's policy of Authenticité. As a judge, he believed that the term [...] "law" [...] applied [...] "not only to legislative acts, but also to regulatory acts which are at least not illegal, as well as international treaties and ratified agreements". In 1971 Lihau joined the executive committee of the state-sanctioned party, Mouvement Populaire de la Révolution (MPR). Three years later he was made a commissioner of its political bureau. That year a new constitution was promulgated that concentrated the government's authority in Mobutu as President. Lihau supported the independence of the judiciary and, despite Mobutu's centralisation, interpreted the document as only veiling such autonomy, not eliminating it. He explained that the constitution's references to the [...] "Judicial Council" [...] (a section of the MPR) in place of the previous term [...] "Judicial Power" [...] were, though obfuscating, done only for political reasons and signified no real change. He surmised, [...] "he <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> courts and tribunals have remained the same as in the past, even if the spirit in which they declare the law will necessarily be different." [...] However, this interpretation ran contrary to Mobutu's ideals. In June 1975 Lihau refused to enforce a harsh sentence levied against student protesters. He was subsequently dismissed from the Supreme Court, removed from his teaching position, and placed under house arrest.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{quantitative}} research project is {{an examination of the}} influence of gender on the <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> blame for rape among African-American undergraduate students at Georgia State University. The <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> blame in a rape scenario (male perpetrator/female victim) will be presented in four pairings, manipulating the race (Black/White) of the victim and perpetrator. The <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> blame will be measured using a modified 5 point Likert-scale and 14 point Likert-scale based on two pre-existing rape attribution scales: Kanekar and Kolsawalla’s “Responsibility and Imprisonment ” 21 point scale (1988) and George and Matrinez’s “Victim Blaming ” 10 point Likert-scale (2002).

2500|$|<b>Attributions</b> <b>of</b> {{responsibility}} for a given transgression may have an adverse effect on forgiveness. [...] Specifically, if a transgression is viewed as intentional or malicious, the offended partner {{is less likely to}} feel empathy and forgive. [...] Based on the notion that forgiveness is driven primarily by empathy, the offender must accept responsibility and seek forgiveness immediately following the transgression, as apologies have shown to elicit empathy from the offended partner. [...] The resulting feelings of empathy elicited in the offended partner may cause them to better relate to the guilt and loneliness their partner may feel {{as a result of the}} transgression. [...] In this state of mind, the offended partner is more likely to seek to normalize the relationship through granting forgiveness and restoring closeness with their partner.|$|E

As a wall separates the two participants, they have no contact except for a mouth, a penis, and perhaps a hand.

Similarly, Dodge and colleagues conducted a study on a sample of school-aged children between 3rd–5th grade and found that children who were rejected were much more likely than other children to exhibit hostile <b>attributions</b> <b>of</b> intent to ambiguous social situations (e.g., when a behavior could have been either accidental or intentional). Furthermore, Dodge and colleagues found that children with high hostile attribution bias then went on to exhibit the most aggressive behaviors later on.|$|E
