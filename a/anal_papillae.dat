The role of the medial olfactory tract (lMOT and mMOT) in reproductive behavior is still under debate. In the present experiment, male reproductive behavior towards prostaglandin-injected females was investigated before and after cutting off the different olfactory tract bundles, to determine which of the tract bundles is essential for mediating reproductive behavior in male crucian carp. The fish were maintained in physiological saline before and after surgery to preserve the remaining tract bundles. Operations were performed symmetrically on both sides and post-operative inspections revealed the functionality of the intact tracts. Sham-operated males and males with only the lMOT intact showed typical reproductive behavior, with following of the female and inspections of the female <b>anal</b> <b>papilla.</b> However, males in which the lMOT was cut, leaving both the mMOT and the LOT intact, showed reduced reproductive behavior.

40|$|AbstractSalinity of {{inland waters}} is {{affected}} by a range of human activities and {{is regarded as a}} major environmental contaminant {{in many parts of the}} world. Changes in salinity are well known to be associated with changes in macroinvertebrate communities of flowing waters. However, as many environmental factors co-vary with salinity, it is not known whether, and if so how, salinity causes communities to change. Being able to measure the osmoregulatory stress that individual stream macroinvertebrates are experiencing would be useful to understand if and how salinity affects their populations and thus communities. Additionally, inferring salinity stress in individual invertebrates could provide a valuable biomonitoring tool to detect the initial effects of salinity before major ecological changes have occurred. Osmoregulation in larval Chironomidae (Diptera) takes place in the <b>anal</b> <b>papillae</b> and their size is believed to be associated with osmoregulatory stress. In two laboratory experiments and a field survey in southern Victoria, Australia, we determine if the size of the <b>anal</b> <b>papillae</b> of larva chironomids is a useful biomarker of salinity stress. Experiments with Chironomus oppositus showed that the surface area of the <b>anal</b> <b>papillae</b> was similar in larva hatched across 5 egg masses collected from 3 sites but were affected by salinity treatments. Furthermore, the (transformed) ratio of this surface area to the body length of the larva was independent of the size of C. oppositus. However, for Chironomus cloacalis, this surface area differed between larva hatched from egg masses collected from the same site. The expected trend in surface area of the <b>anal</b> <b>papillae</b> relative to the size of larva (Chironomu alternans, C. cloacalis, Dicrotendipes sp., Criptochironomus sp. and Tanypodinae) was not duplicated in the field survey.

40|$|In the osmoregulatory epithelia of {{freshwater}} (FW) animals, transcellular solute transport relies {{on at least}} one of the primary ionomotive pumps, Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and V-type H+-ATPase (VA), but there are no data on their distribution in FW chironomid larvae. The paracellular solute movement in invertebrate epithelia is controlled by the septate junctions (SJs). However, nothing is known about the SJ components in aquatic insects. In the present set of studies, larvae of the FW chironomid Chironomus riparius and FW mosquito Aedes aegypti were used to examine a role for NKA and VA and SJ proteins, respectively, in the maintenance of salt and water balance in aquatic dipterans. Spatial distribution and activity of NKA and VA along the alimentary canal of C. riparius larvae revealed the importance of the rectum in the ionoregulatory homeostasis. It was found that the rectum absorbed relatively high amounts of K+ into the hemolymph under dilute conditions and decreased K+ absorption in brackish water (BW). This rectal K+ absorption was dependent on the activities of both NKA and VA. Next, genes encoding transmembrane SJ proteins megatrachea, sinuous, kune-kune (Kune), neurexin IV, snakeskin (Ssk), mesh and gliotactin (Gli) were identified in A. aegypti and shown to exhibit tissue specific transcript abundance in larval osmoregulatory epithelia. Ssk and mesh expression was restricted to smooth SJ bearing midgut and Malpighian tubules (MT) whereas Gli was detected in all tissues examined. Kune was confined to SJs in the posterior midgut and rectum and apical membrane domain of the syncytial <b>anal</b> <b>papilla</b> epithelium. Rearing A. aegypti larvae in BW caused an increase in Kune and Gli protein and Ssk and mesh mRNA abundance in the midgut and MT which occurred in conjunction with increased midgut and decreased MT permeability. Paracellular MT permeability was further modulated by leucokinin. When dsRNA was used to reduce Gli abundance in the midgut, paracellular permeability was decreased. Together, this research provides a better understanding of the physiology of transepithelial ion and water transport in aquatic insects and offers significant insight into the role of NKA, VA and SJ proteins in the osmoregulation of FW dipteran larvae...|$|R

Because complications such as incontinence are associated with surgical treatment, chemical sphincterotomy is currently favored. Objectives: The objective {{of this study is to}} compare the difference in outcome between open partial lateral anal sphincterotomy and application of topical 0. 2 % nitroglycerin ointment for the treatment of chronic anal fissure. Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study carried out between January 16, 2007 and January 15, 2008 in the Surgical Department of Jinnah Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. Sixty consecutive cases with a clinical diagnosis of chronic anal fissure were recruited in the study. All recruited patients met the study inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Group A was managed conservatively using topical 0. 2 % nitroglycerin ointment, whereas Group B underwent open partial lateral anal sphincterotomy. Both groups were followed up at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks after the treatment. Results: All the patients complained of pain. A total of 43 (71. 7 %) patients had pain with constipation, whereas 31 (51. 7 %) patients had bleeding per rectum. Upon clinically examining the anal area, tenderness was elicited in all 60 (100 %) patients. Group A included 30 (11 females and 19 males) cases treated with topical 0. 2 % nitroglycerin ointment and Group B included 30 (11 females and 19 males) cases who underwent open partial lateral anal sphincterotomy.

40|$|Background: Chronic {{anal fissure}} (CAF) is a painful {{condition}} that {{is unlikely to}} resolve with conventional conservative management. Previous studies have reported that topical treatment of CAF with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) reduces pain and promotes healing, but optimal treatment duration is unknown. Methods: To assess the effect of different treatment durations on CAF, we designed a prospective randomized trial comparing 40 versus 80 days with twice daily topical 0. 4 % GTN treatment (Rectogesic®, Prostrakan Group). Chronicity was defined {{by the presence of}} both morphological (fibrosis, skin tag, exposed sphincter, hypertrophied <b>anal</b> <b>papilla)</b> and time criteria (symptoms present for more than 2 months or pain of less duration but similar episodes in the past). A gravity score (1 = no visible sphincter; 2 = visible sphincter; 3 = visible sphincter and fibrosis) was used at baseline. Fissure healing, the primary endpoint of the study, maximum pain at defecation measured with VAS and maximum anal resting pressure were assessed at baseline and at 14, 28, 40 and 80 days. Data was gathered {{at the end of the}} assigned treatment. Results: Of 188 patients with chronic fissure, 96 were randomized to the 40 -day group and 92 to the 80 -day group. Patients were well matched for sex, age, VAS and fissure score. There were 34 (19 %) patients who did not complete treatment, 18 (10 %) because of side effects. Of 154 patients who completed treatment, 90 (58 %) had their fissures healed and 105 (68 %) were pain free. There was no difference in healing or symptoms between the 40 - and the 80 -day group. There was no predictor of fissure healing. A low fissure gravity score correlated with increased resolution of pain (P < 0. 05) and improvement of VAS score (P < 0. 05) on both univariate and multivariate analysis. A lower baseline resting pressure was associated with better pain resolution on univariate analysis (P < 0. 01). VAS at defecation and fissure healing significantly improved until 40 days (P < 0. 001), while the difference between 40 and 80 days was not significant. Conclusion: We found no benefits in treating CAF with topical GTN for 80 days compared to 40 days. Fissure healing and VAS improvement continue until 6 weeks of treatment but are unlikely thereafter. © 2010 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

Larvae in post-flexion occurred in the marginal vegetation, and adults only in gaps between boulders and stones in the river channel. Juveniles occurred in both environments. Spawns {{were found in the}} natural habitat in rapid stretches, with the eggs attached to the lower surface of stones in openings formed in the riverbed. The number of eggs per stone ranged from 62 to 375, with significant differences among the mean sizes of the eggs. Sexual dimorphism was noticed to N. microps. The <b>anal</b> and urogenital <b>papillae</b> are separated in males and merged in females and there is an epidermal growth along the pectoral-fin spine of males...|$|R
