5|$|Entering the facility, Alice meets a {{holograph}} of the Red Queen's sister AI, the White Queen (Madeline Carroll). The White Queen informs Alice {{that her}} blood is the cure to the T-virus, defending the Red Queen's actions as well. She then tells Alice about Dr. Isaacs. Alice agrees {{to deal with}} him. On {{her way to the}} lab's lower levels, Alice discovers one of her clones, still in development. The clone awakens, but seems to die from shock upon seeing Alice. Alice finds a replica of the mansion she lived in and finds Isaacs, who fights her with equal strength and telekinesis. Finding themselves in a replica of The Hive's laser corridor, Alice awaits the grid's arrival, watching Isaacs getting sliced into cubes. Just as Alice is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the same fate, the system is deactivated by her clone, which has inexplicably revived.|$|E
25|$|A Rwandan {{colonel who}} called the army command about 40 minutes after the crash was told {{that there was no}} {{confirmation}} that the president was dead. About half an hour later, roughly 9:30, the situation was still confused at army command, though it appeared clear that the presidential aircraft had exploded and that it had probably been hit by a missile. News arrived that Major-General DÃ©ogratias Nsabimana, the army chief of staff, had been on the plane. The officers present realized {{that they would have to}} appoint a new chief of staff in order to clarify the chain of command and began a meeting to decide whom to appoint. Col. Bagosora joined them soon afterward. At about 10 pm, Ephrem Rwabalinda, the government liaison officer to UNAMIR, called Dallaire to inform him that a crisis committee was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet.</b> After informing his superiors in New York City of the situation, Dallaire went to attend the meeting, where he found Bagosora in charge.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2011, India's sister, Texas (Bianca Hendrickse-Spendlove), ends up at Silas's mercy {{after taking}} drugs {{to help get}} through India's funeral. Hendrickse-Spendlove {{explained}} the situation to Inside Soap, saying [...] "Texas has sex with Doug to get cocaine and a cocktail of tranquilisers. But she's {{in such a state}} that she misses the funeral." [...] Texas is a [...] "complete wreck" [...] and after she is thrown out of Chez Chez nightclub, Silas finds her and takes her to the woods. Hendrickse-Spendlove said that [...] "It really looks like she's <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the same horrible fate as her sister". Silas eventually decides not to kill Texas.|$|E

6000|$|There was, however, a {{champion}} who, on November 19, challenged Knox {{and the other}} preachers to a discussion, either orally or by interchange of letters. This was Mary's own chaplain, Rene Benoit. Mary probably {{knew that he was}} <b>about</b> <b>to</b> offer <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> [...] "the most learned John Knox and other most erudite men, called ministers"; it is thus that Rene addresses them in his [...] "Epistle" [...] of November 19.|$|R

2500|$|Once, when Cao Cao was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> an {{emissary}} {{from the}} Xiongnu, {{he felt that}} he looked ugly and {{might not be able to}} command respect so he ordered Cui Yan to impersonate him while he carried a sword and stood beside Cui, pretending to be a bodyguard. After the meeting, Cao Cao sent someone to ask the Xiongnu emissary, [...] "What are your thoughts about the King of Wei?" [...] The Xiongnu emissary replied, [...] "The King looks handsome and extraordinary. However, the man who was carrying a sword and standing beside him is a real hero." [...] Cao Cao had the emissary killed when he heard that.|$|E
2500|$|While sailing off Bermuda Cleopatra sighted a sail--the 40-gun French frigate Ville de Milan. Ville de Milan had sailed from Martinique on 28 January under Captain Jean-Marie Renaud and {{was bound}} for France with several {{important}} dispatches. Despite identifying his quarry as a superior opponent, Laurie ordered a chase. Renaud had orders to avoid combat and pressed on sail to escape Laurie. The chase covered 180 miles and lasted {{until the following}} morning, when Renaud reluctantly came <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> Cleopatra, which was overhauling Ville de Milan. The engagement began in earnest at 2:30pm, and a heavy cannonade was maintained between the two frigates until 5pm, when the Cleopatra had her wheel shot away and her rudder jammed. Ville de Milan approached from windward and ran aboard Cleopatra, jamming her bowsprit over the quarterdeck while raking Cleopatras decks with musket fire. The British resisted one attempt to board, but on being unable to break free, were forced to surrender to a second boarding party. Cleopatra had 22 killed and 36 wounded, {{with the loss of}} her foremast, mainmast and bowsprit. [...] Ville de Milan probably had about 30 killed and wounded, with Captain Renaud among the dead. She also lost her mainmast and mizzenmast. Three days were spent transferring a prize crew and prisoners, and patching up the ships, before the two got underway on 21 February.|$|E

6000|$|The {{next morning}} Elmore was called from his bed--at no very early hour, {{it must be}} owned, but at least before a nine o'clock breakfast--to see a gentleman who {{was waiting in the}} parlor.
