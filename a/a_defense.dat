5000|$|<b>A</b> {{political}} <b>defense</b> {{is distinguished}} from <b>a</b> legal <b>defense.</b> <b>A</b> legal <b>defense,</b> or <b>a</b> [...] "technical defense", seeks acquittal by demonstrating that the defendant's conduct did not satisfy {{all of the}} elements of the alleged crime. In <b>a</b> political <b>defense,</b> the defendant might concede that the conduct took place, but attempt to convince the jury or the public that the conduct was inherently just because of its political motivation.

He became an international authority on vapor growth techniques with an emphasis on mercuric iodide crystals and its application in the nuclear industry as gamma ray detectors.
