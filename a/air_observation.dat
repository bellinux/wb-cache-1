5|$|German Kriegsmarine ships {{before the}} Second World War were either light gray overall or had dark gray hulls, and many {{retained}} this scheme during the war. The cruiser Deutschland, for instance, had a gray hull and light gray superstructure in 1934. Others had dazzle camouflage, usually in combinations of pale gray, dark gray and sea blue. For example, {{the hull of}} the battleship Scharnhorst had a dazzle pattern of stripes on a gray background in 1940, but some of these were later painted out, and the bows forward of the main guns painted black. Scharnhorst was not camouflaged against <b>air</b> <b>observation,</b> her decks fore and aft bearing large black on white swastikas on a red field; her main gun turrets had red (in the Baltic) or yellow tops for air recognition. The battleship Bismarck set out to Norway in dazzle camouflage; this was painted out with gray for her final trip to the Atlantic. The cruiser Admiral Scheer wore a low contrast pattern of irregular dark gray marks on light gray for her superstructure, with a dark gray hull, black waterline and, away from air support while out raiding in 1941, dark gray turret tops.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, No.1 FTS {{started running}} two courses each year, the first commencing in January {{and the second}} in July; it also ceased graduating non-commissioned {{officers}} as pilots, and thus took on a character resembling the other armed services' cadet colleges, the Royal Australian Naval College and the Royal Military College, Duntroon. The roughly 1,200 applications for each flying course competed for around twelve places. Wing Commander Hippolyte DeLa Rue became commanding officer in early 1933. The following year, No.1 FTS commenced regular courses in signals, photography, <b>air</b> <b>observation,</b> and aircraft maintenance. In April 1936, the school took delivery of its first Avro Cadets, procured as an intermediate trainer {{to bridge the gap}} between the Gipsy Moth employed for elementary flying instruction and the Wapiti used for advanced training. De La Rue was succeeded by Wing Commander Frank Lukis in January 1938. By this time the school was training up to 96 new pilots per year, a small percentage of whom were slated for secondment to the RAF on short-service commissions. Link Trainer simulators were introduced in March 1939.|$|E

5|$|Green-head ant {{males are}} {{produced}} irregularly {{throughout the year}} and are low-flying ants. Recorded nuptial flights begin between September to November at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), when a number of males begin to emerge from their nest. Sometimes, however, the males may return to their nest after briefly appearing outside. The green-head ant is a gamergate species, which means that males can successfully mate with the workers. These workers remain outside their nest with their head and thorax appressed and gaster elevated into the <b>air.</b> <b>Observation</b> has shown the workers first attacking the males when the two first encounter each other, followed by the male mounting the worker by grasping it in the cervical region with its mandibles, successfully attaching itself. Both ants usually rest when they mate, but sometimes the workers may groom themselves or move about several moments after, thereby disengaging with the male. On a few occasions, workers have been seen to move as soon as copulation begins and drag the male, eventually dislodging it. Copulation usually occurs at 8 to 9 in the morning, with pairs lasting for 30 seconds to almost one minute. Most pairs mate once, but others may copulate with each other twice. In some cases, males will successfully mate with two workers, and some pairs may return to their nest while mating.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{introducing}} satellite temperature sounding {{data on a}} numerical weather prediction model of a national weather service is evaluated. A dry five level, primitive equation model which covers most of the Northern Hemisphere, is used for these experiments. Series of parallel forecast runs out to 48 hours are made with three different sets of initial conditions: (1) NOSAT runs, only conventional surface and upper <b>air</b> <b>observations</b> are used; (2) SAT runs, satellite soundings {{are added to the}} conventional data over oceanic regions and North Africa; and (3) ALLSAT runs, the conventional upper <b>air</b> <b>observations</b> are replaced by satellite soundings over the entire model domain. The impact on the forecasts is evaluated by three verification methods: the RMS errors in sea level pressure forecasts, systematic errors in sea level pressure forecasts, and errors in subjective forecasts of significant weather elements for a selected portion of the model domain. For the relatively short range of the present forecasts, the major beneficial impacts on the sea level pressure forecasts are found precisely in those areas where the satellite sounding are inserted and where conventional upper <b>air</b> <b>observations</b> are sparse. The RMS and systematic errors are reduced in these regions. The subjective forecasts of significant weather elements are improved {{with the use of the}} satellite data. It is found that the ALLSAT forecasts are of a quality comparable to the SAR forecasts...|$|R

40|$|On May 30, 1998 {{scrap metal}} {{containing}} radioactive Cesium- 137 (Cs- 137) was accidentally melted in a furnace at the Acerinox steel mill in Algeciras, Spain. Cs- 137 {{was released from}} the mill's smokestack, and spread across the western Mediterranean Sea to France and Italy and beyond. The first indication of the release was radiation levels up to 1000 times background reported by Swiss, French, and Italian authorities during the following two weeks. Initially no elevated radiation levels were detected over Spain. A release of hazardous material to the atmosphere is the type of situation the Atmospheric Release Advisory Capability (ARAC) emergency response organization was designed to address. The amount and exact time of the release were unknown, though the incident was thought to have taken place during the last week in May. Using air concentration measurements supplied by colleagues of ARAC in Spain, France, Switzerland, Italy, Sweden, Russia and the European Union, ARAC meteorologists estimated the magnitude and timing of the release (Vogt, 1999). Correctly locating the downwind footprint is the most important goal of emergency response modeling. In this study, we compare predicted results for the Algeciras event based on four wind data sources: (1) US Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS) data alone, (2) surface and upper <b>air</b> <b>observations</b> alone, (3) NOGAPS data together with surface and upper <b>air</b> <b>observations,</b> and (4) forecasts from ARAC's in-house execution of the U. S. Navy Operational Regional Atmospheric Prediction System (NORAPS) (without surface or upper <b>air</b> <b>observations).</b> We compare the resulting dispersion predictions from ARAC's diagnostic dispersion modeling system to the measurements supplied by our European colleagues to determine which data source produced the best results...|$|R
50|$|MRMS is {{a system}} with {{automated}} algorithms that quickly and intelligently integrate data streams from multiple radars, surface and upper <b>air</b> <b>observations,</b> lightning detection systems, and satellite and forecast models. Numerous two-dimensional multiple-sensor products offer assistance for hail, wind, tornado, quantitative precipitation estimation forecasts, convection, icing, and turbulence diagnosis.The MRMS system was developed to produce severe weather and precipitation products for improved decision-making capability to improve severe weather forecasts and warnings, hydrology, aviation, and numerical weather prediction.|$|R
50|$|Upper <b>air</b> <b>observations</b> are {{the single}} most {{important}} data set driving a forecast model. Fine-scale regional forecast accuracy is dependent on a representation of the mid and upper-level atmospheric flow, moisture, and wave patterns. If these features are properly analyzed during the model initialization period, then an accurate forecast will ensue. TAMDAR data has been shown to increase forecast accuracy over the U.S. on the order of 30- to 50-percent for a monthly average, even for 3D-Var (GSI) models.|$|R
