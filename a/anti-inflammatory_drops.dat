30|$|In 2002, a 38 -year-old male sought {{care for}} flashes and floaters, blurred vision, {{intermittent}} eye redness, and photophobia OU. Initial best corrected visual acuity was 20 / 20 OU with bilateral peripheral field constriction, vitritis, and choroidal lesions. At that time, {{he was diagnosed}} with bilateral panuveitis with cystoid macular edema (CME) and started on 40 mg oral prednisone daily and topical steroid and nonsteroidal <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drops.</b> A laboratory workup included complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibodies, rapid plasma reagin, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test, angiotensin converting enzyme, chest X-ray, and toxoplasmosis serology - all of which were within normal limits. In 2004, his visual acuity deteriorated to 20 / 60 OU. A diagnostic vitrectomy was performed in the left eye and was negative for malignancy and infection. Vision failed to improve, despite bilateral cataract surgery, due to persistent bilateral vitritis, episodes of anterior uveitis, CME, and epiretinal membranes. He was treated only with steroid and nonsteroidal <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drops</b> over this time period.|$|E
40|$|Corneal stromal and/or {{penetrating}} ocular {{injuries from}} pencils and pencil lead {{are more common}} in childhood and may lead to intraocular infection or severe intraocular sterile inflammatory reaction. Herein we report 3 children with ocular trauma due to pencil lead injuries. The first case had corneal stromal injury caused by a pencil. In the second case, a pencil perforated the cornea and contacted the iris. In the third case, pencil lead perforated both the cornea and iris and reached the vitreous through the lens zonules. Intracameral triamcinolone (2 mg/ 0. 05 mL) was injected after the pencil lead {{was removed from the}} eyeball. Topical <b>anti-inflammatory</b> and cycloplegic <b>drops</b> were prescribed. In conclusion, corneal and especially penetrating ocular injuries from pencil lead may have a good prognosis with the use of appropriate anti-inflammatory and prophylactic antibiotic treatment and follow-up...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} {{clinical}} value of {{non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}} in adjuvant treatment of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide(IVTA) for macular edema caused by retinal vein occlusion(RVO). METHODS: Forty-eight eyes in 48 patients were randomly divided into trial and control group(24 eyes each) in this prospective study. In the trial group, additional pranoprofen drops was administered from 1 d before IVTA to 30 d after injection. Central foveal thickness(CFT) was measured with optical coherence tomography(OCT). Available documents of best corrected visual acuity(BCVA), CFT, intraocular pressure and complications pre- and post-injection at 3 d, 1, 2 wk, 1 and 3 mo were evaluated. RESULTS: After IVTA, BCVA was improved in both groups at different levels; {{but there was no}} statistically significant between two groups at each time point(P > 0. 05). The CFT values were 629 ± 43 μm vs 605 ± 57 μm before IVTA in the trail vs control groups(P> 0. 05). The values were 432 ± 74 μm vs 511 ± 32 μm(t = 7. 533, P vs 379 ± 29 μm(t = 13. 212, P vs control groups at 1 and 3 mo after IVTA, respectively. Ocular hypertension occurred in 5 eyes after injection in trail group, and was controlled with anti-glaucoma medication and one eye with filtration surgery. Progression of cataract was noted in 3 of 35 phakic eyes and cataract surgery was performed in 2 eyes at 4 - 12 mo after injection in trail group. Progression of cataract was noted in 4 eyes and cataract surgery was performed in 2 eyes at 4 - 12 mo after injection in control group. No retinal detachment and endophthalmitis happened during the whole period of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Application of non-steroidal <b>anti-inflammatory</b> eye <b>drops</b> in perioperative period can be useful to improve the outcome of IVTA for macular edema, which needs further evaluation...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Isolar microrganismo em microceratótomo, induzir ceratite infecciosa avaliando a resposta terapêutica. MÉTODOS: Foram {{realizadas}} coletas consecutivas de {{material a}} partir do microceratótomo usado rotineiramente para cirurgia refrativa em olhos humanos durante um período de 8 dias. Preparou-se uma diluição segundo a escala de MacFarland para inocular na córnea de cobaias. Utilizaram-se oito animais, injetou-se 10 µl no estroma corneano de ambos os olhos. No olho direito não se instilou medicamento (grupo 1) e no olho esquerdo instilou-se ciprofloxacina 0, 3 % associado a dexametasona a 0, 1 % e trometamina de cetorolac de 4 em 4 horas por 24 horas (grupo 2). Após este período as cobaias foram sacrificadas e as córneas divididas, sendo uma metade enviada para análise microbiológica e outra para histopatologia. RESULTADOS: No grupo sem tratamento, todas as 8 amostras foram positivas, ao passo que no grupo tratado, 3 desenvolveram cultura positiva para Staphylococcus aureus (p= 0, 0128). A avaliação histopatológica de polimorfonucleares e monomorfonucleares no estroma mostrou que eram menos numerosos no grupo tratado (grupo 2), com p= 0, 0203 e p= 0, 0051, respectivamente. CONCLUSÃO: Este estudo portanto sugere que o uso de antibiótico de amplo espectro associado a antiinflamatório tem efeito significativo na diminuição do processo inflamatório e infeccioso em possível contaminação intra-estromal após cirurgia refrativa. PURPOSE: To harvest microorganisms from the microkeratome after LASIK. To induce experimental infectious keratitis and investigate {{the use of}} routine postoperative medication. METHODS: During eight consecutive days, we cultured the plate of the microkeratome after routine LASIK. Dilutions of the most frequent microorganism was prepared according to the MacFarland scale. Ten microliters were injected into both corneas of eight guinea pigs. The right cornea was used as control and the left cornea was treated with 0. 3 % ciprofloxacin associated with dexamethasone and ketorolac tromethamine every 4 hours for 24 hours (group 2). The animals were sacrificed and the corneas {{were divided into two}} halves, which were sent to analyzed by the microbiology and histopathology laboratory. RESULTS: In the control group, Staphylococcus aureus could be retrieved from all corneas, while in group 2, only 50 % showed positive cultures (p= 0. 0128). Histopathology concerning polymorphonuclear cells showed an intense degree of inflammation in group 1 (p= 0. 0203) and regarding monomorphonuclear cells, it was also more intense in group 1 (p= 0. 0051). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the use of wide-spectrum antibiotic associated with <b>anti-inflammatory</b> eye <b>drops</b> has a significant effect on the reduction of a potential infectious and inflammatory process after refractive surgery...|$|R

40|$|Xihui Lin, Harrison Dwight Cavanagh Department of Ophthalmology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the ocular presentation, treatment, and clinical course of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Design: Retrospective case series. Participants: Two hundred and forty-nine patients with systemic GVHD {{were included in}} the study. Methods: Ocular and systemic data were collected from 2003 to 2013. Main outcome measures: Mortality, visual acuity, and response of ocular symptoms. Results: Sixty-four patients had ocular manifestations (25. 7 %). At presentation, the mean age was 44. 5 years and mean latency was 16. 4 months. The most common presentations were keratoconjunctivitis sicca, cataract, blepharitis, ocular hypertension, and filamentary keratitis. Visual acuity at presentation was 20 / 49; at the worst point in the disease was 20 / 115; and at most recent visit was 20 / 63. When topical <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drops</b> were used in addition to tears, 54. 3 % of patients’ ocular symptoms stabilized. When autologous serum was used in addition, 80 % stabilized. The overall 10 -year mortality of GVHD was 29. 7 %. For those with ocular involvement, it was 21. 9 %. Conclusion: Systemic GVHD has a high mortality rate, but ocular involvement does not suggest a worse prognosis. The main ocular presentations were keratoconjunctivitis sicca, cataracts, and ocular hypertension. Dry eyes in this population were very severe with overall worsening in visual acuity. However, with a step-wise approach involving topical anti-inflammatory medications and autologous serum tears, ocular symptoms do improve. It is important to monitor these patients closely, as they are prone to serious ocular complications such as corneal perforation and endophthalmitis.
