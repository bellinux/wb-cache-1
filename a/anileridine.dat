25|$|Pethidine, {{also known}} as {{meperidine}} and sold under the brand name Demerol among others, is a synthetic opioid pain medication of the phenylpiperidine class. Synthesized in 1939 as a potential anticholinergic agent by the German chemist Otto Eisleb, its analgesic properties were first recognized by Otto Schaumann while working for IG Farben, Germany. Pethidine is the prototype of a large family of analgesics including the pethidine 4-phenylpiperidines (piminodine, <b>anileridine</b> and others), the prodines (alphaprodine, MPPP, etc.), bemidones (ketobemidone, etc.) and others more distant, including diphenoxylate and analogues.|$|E

[...] <b>Anileridine</b> is in Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act 1970 of the United States as ACSCN 9020 with a zero aggregate manufacturing quota as of 2014. The free base conversion ratio for salts includes 0.83 for the dihydrochloride and 0.73 for the phosphate [...] It is also under international control per UN treaties.|$|E

50|$|<b>Anileridine</b> (trade name: Leritine) is a {{synthetic}} analgesic drug {{and is a}} member of the piperidine class of analgesic agents developed by Merck & Co. in the 1950s. It differs from pethidine (meperidine) in that the N-methyl group of meperidine is replaced by an N-aminophenethyl group, which increases its analgesic activity.|$|E

Synthesized in 1939 as a potential anticholinergic agent by the German chemist Otto Eisleb, its analgesic properties were first recognized by Otto Schaumann while working for IG Farben, Germany. [...] Pethidine was the first wholly synthetic opioid developed and is the prototype of a large family of analgesics including the pethidine 4-phenylpiperidines (pethidine, piminodine, <b>anileridine</b> and others), the prodines (alphaprodine, MPPP, etc.), bemidones (ketobemidone, etc.) and others more distant, including diphenoxylate and analogues.|$|E
50|$|Phenadoxone (Heptalgin, Morphidone, Heptazone) is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{of the open}} chain class (methadone and relatives) invented in Germany by Hoechst in 1947. It {{is one of a}} handful of useful synthetic analgesics which were used in the United States for various lengths of time in the 20 or so years after the end of the Second World War but which were withdrawn from the market for various or no known reason and which now are mostly in Schedule I of the United States' Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or (like phenazocine and bezitramide) in Schedule II but not produced or marketed in the US. Others on this list are ketobemidone (Ketogin), dextromoramide (Dimorlin, Palfium and others), phenazocine (Narphen and Prinadol), dipipanone (Diconal, Pipadone and Wellconal), piminodine (Alvodine), propiram (Algeril), <b>anileridine</b> (Leritine) and alphaprodine (Nisentil).|$|E
40|$|<b>ANILERIDINE</b> {{dihydrochloride}} {{has been}} shown to be a useful analgesic agent for pre-operative medication (Dechene and Hebert, 1959), post-operative medication (Riffin et aL, 1958; Dechene and Hebert, 1959) and for the supplementation of anaesthesia (Chang, Safar and Lasagna, 1958; Swerdlow, Brown and Tetlow, 1960). The present paper reports a small study of the effects of <b>anileridine</b> on respiration in anaesthetized sub-jects. The results are compared with those of an investigation of the respiratory effects of pethi-dine, carried out earlier under identical conditions (Swerdlow, 1957).

40|$|It has {{generally}} been accepted that for analgesic activity a methyl group is the optimal radical on the nitrogen atom present in all potent analgesics (Braenden et al., 1955; Burger, 1951; and Schaumann, 1940). Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that phenethyl increases analgesic activity when substituted for methyl on the nitrogen of certain analgesic compounds (Clark et at., 1953; Per-rifle and Eddy, 1956). Work in our laboratories has also indicated that further substitution, now on the aromatic ring of the phenethyl radical, produces a greater increase in potency and other desirable characteristics. An extensive program {{based on these findings}} has led to the synthesis of ethyl- 1 -(4 -amino-phenethyl) - 4 -phenylisonipecotate (Weijlard et al., 1956). This compound, given the generic name <b>anileridine,</b> {{is a member of the}} piper-idine class of analgesic agents. It differs chemically from meperidine in that the N-methyl group of meperidine is replaced by N-(p-aminophenethyl). Since this change introduces a second basic group into the molecule, <b>anileridine</b> forms a dihydrochloride. The structural formula of the compound in comparison with meperidine is shown below...|$|E
