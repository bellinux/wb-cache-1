50|$|Investigators interviewed Captain Wu. Captain Wu Xinlu {{stated that}} as he {{observed}} {{the lights on the}} final approach course to Runway 36L, he saw neither the runway approach lights on the downwind leg nor the circling guidance lights during the circling approach were on. According to the record of the <b>automatic</b> aeronautical <b>light</b> <b>switching</b> system, and the testimony from the Gimhae Tower duty chief, the runway, approach lights and circling guidance lights were on {{at the time of the}} accident.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper offers}} ideas for {{designed}} a lighting system based RF Transceiver. design involves two sensors, sensor based infrared and sensor based light intensity and then becomes the input for the processor media. {{the output of}} the system is <b>automatic</b> <b>switch</b> <b>lights.</b> The <b>automatic</b> <b>switch</b> ensures that the circuit remains turned off when natural illumination is available. The <b>automatic</b> <b>light</b> is made functional from dusk to dawn because sensor reads the light intensity. A movement sensor is used to enhance the conservation of energy. It makes the <b>automatic</b> <b>light</b> operate on low brightnesswhen there is no movement. When a person is approaching, the brightness increases till the person has passed. This function is useful to indoors where it can increase power savings when there is not much movement at night...|$|R
50|$|On Thursday 13 July 2006, the Kings {{unveiled}} {{their brand}} new showhome {{which was to}} house married couple, Marlon Dingle (Mark Charnock) and Donna Windsor-Dingle (Verity Rushworth). When local resident, Noreen Bell (Jenny Tomasin) opened a cupboard door inside the house, it triggered an <b>automatic</b> <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> that an electric spark discharged causing a gas ignition. that caused a large gas explosion that catapulted her down the stairs. The explosion ripped through the bathroom floor knocking Jimmy (Nick Miles) and Sadie King (Patsy Kensit) to {{opposite sides of the}} bathroom. The estate agent David Brown (Peter Alexander), who was located near the cupboard, was set alight. While running towards the house, Marlon and Donna were thrown back by another explosion. Debris such as a spark plug, a toaster, a boiler, and windows started to fly towards the residents as the house started to explode in various places. Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen) was knocked out by a collapsing ceiling while Danny Daggert (Cleveland Campbell) and Dawn Woods (Julia Mallam), who were running behind her, got caught in another explosion. The bathroom floor gave way and Jimmy fell through, shortly followed by Sadie. The house then fully collapsed horrifyingly as the residents of Emmerdale watched in shock. Three were confirmed dead: Noreen Bell, who was hit by the full force of the initial explosion and died instantly, Dawn Woods, who was rescued from the rubble but later died in hospital as a result of internal injuries from burns and Smoke inhalation, and the estate agent David from burns.|$|R
40|$|This diploma work {{discusses}} {{the design of}} an <b>automatic</b> <b>lighting</b> for the home. Each access point in the rooms is designed to detect with two laser beams. Laser beams can be extended with PIR sensor and a mechanical switch. An access point can be, for example frames. By this is achieved that when entering the room the <b>light</b> is <b>switched</b> on and the light goes off when leaving. <b>Automatic</b> <b>lighting</b> controls consists of the central panel, the remote sensing and the detection frame. The control panel controls laser beams and lights. Remote control is used to <b>switch</b> on/off the <b>light</b> in the certain room. The detection frame is used to detect a person who enters or leaves the room...|$|R

2500|$|A toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> is a switch, most {{commonly}} used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets whereby the switch handle does not control the contacts directly, but through an intermediate arrangement of internal springs and levers. The toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> is safe, reliable, and durable, but produces a loud [...] "snap" [...] or [...] "click" [...] noise when a person's finger manually flips the toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> into the on/off position. The design for the toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> was patented in 1916 by William J. Newton and Morris Goldberg of Lynbrook, New York.|$|R

5000|$|The {{switches}} may be {{single or}} multiple, designed for indoor or outdoor use. Optional extras may include dimmer-controls, environmental protection, weather and security protection. In residential and light commercial lighting systems, the <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> directly controls the circuit feeding the lamps. In larger lighting systems, for example warehouses or outdoor lighting systems, the required current {{may be too}} high for a manual switch. In these systems <b>light</b> <b>switches</b> control <b>lighting</b> contactors, a relay that allows the manual <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> to operate on a lower voltage or with smaller wiring than would be required in the main lighting circuit.|$|R
