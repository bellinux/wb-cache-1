5|$|Stephen Báthory {{was elected}} King of Poland on 15 December 1575. He adopted {{the title of}} Prince of Transylvania and made Christopher voivode on 14 January 1576. An Ottoman {{delegation}} confirmed Christopher's appointment at the Diet in Gyulafehérvár (now Alba Iulia in Romania) in July. The sultan's charter (or ahidnâme) sent to Christopher emphasized that he should keep the peace along the frontiers. Stephen set up a separate chancellery in Kraków to keep <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> administration of Transylvania. The {{head of the new}} chancellery, Márton Berzeviczy, and Christopher cooperated closely.|$|E
5|$|Abandoned by Emperor Manuel, Stephen IV {{approached}} Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor. Around {{the same}} time, {{a group of}} Hungarian barons and prelates {{sent a letter to}} Emperor Frederick, stating that they were willing to accept his suzerainty. Stephen III also dispatched his envoys to Frederick, who decided not to intervene, but ordered his vassalsthe King of Bohemia, the Duke of Austria, and the Margrave of Styriato keep <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> political situation in Hungary. King Vladislaus' son, Sviatopluk, even married Stephen III's sister, Odola.

5|$|As Tropical Depression Five-E {{approached}} Mexico, the country's government released {{tropical storm}} watches and warnings for {{certain parts of}} the coastline. When the tropical depression formed on July 5, the government issued a tropical storm warning from Acapulco to Zihuatanejo. Other interests in the Pacific Ocean were asked to keep <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> developing depression. The morning of July 6, the Mexican government issued a tropical storm watch for Zihuatanejo to Manzanillo. The earlier tropical storm warning remained in effect, for another six hours, when the warning was demoted into a tropical storm watch. On the afternoon of July 6, the government discontinued the tropical storm watch up to Acapulco. The remaining tropical storm watch was discontinued on July 7, after the tropical depression had made landfall and began to weaken. The government's weather center also released thirteen tropical cyclone bulletins and four warnings for personal caution.|$|E

The new layout features wooden floors, with simply dressed tables. On each table sits three stones to signify the three Roca brothers, while the tableware is Rosenthal china. The enlarged kitchen in the new location includes space for thirty chefs to work and also features Joan Roca's open plan office, {{so that he can}} keep <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chefs even while he is doing more administrative tasks. At least one of the three brothers is present for every service. There is a capacity for 45 diners.|$|E
5|$|Many {{tropical}} cyclones develop {{when the}} atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance {{in the atmosphere}} are favorable. Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics. Tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop <b>an</b> <b>eye.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> {{other end of the}} spectrum, if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses. A tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Typhoon Dinah {{can be traced}} back to a poorly {{organized}} area of disturbed weather that formed on August18 close to Guam and was embedded in the monsoon trough, at the time situated near the equator. At 06:00UTC on August19, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system, as the system started to show signs of organization. Shortly thereafter, a low pressure area developed along the axis of the system, prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to start keeping <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> low. Late on August20, there was a rapid increase in the coverage of the thunderstorm activity, and satellite intensity estimates via the Dvorak Technique reached T2.0/. Based on this, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression at 00:00UTC on August21.|$|E
5|$|To {{their right}} is the king's nephew, prince Józef Poniatowski (34), in {{the uniform of}} the light cavalry of the Duchy of Warsaw and riding a grey horse. The uniform is another {{instance}} of foreshadowing; Poniatowski became the commander-in-chief of the Duchy's army and died during the Battle of Leipzig. At {{the time of the}} passing of the Constitution, he was the commander of the Warsaw garrison, and is shown keeping <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> procession, with his soldiers lined up and guarding the street. To his right, partially obscured by Poniatowski's horse's head, is Stanisław Mokronowski (35), deputy, general, and future leader of the Kościuszko Uprising in Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} ridge {{caused the}} storm to slow and {{turn back to}} the west. After the formerly hostile shear relaxed, Bindu became a tropical cyclone again on January11, redeveloping <b>an</b> <b>eye.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> next day, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 150km/h (90mph), while the JTWC estimated maximum 1minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). By that time, the cyclone had turned back to the south-southwest. Drier air and wind shear resulted in weakening, and Bindu was downgraded to a severe tropical storm on January14. At 18:00UTC the next day, the storm passed about 140km (85mi) southeast of Rodrigues island, by which time the circulation was exposed north of the dwindling convection. The MFR downgraded Bindu to tropical depression status on January16. An approaching trough turned the system to the south on the next day, and Bindu became extratropical late on January17. The remnants turned sharply eastward due to a ridge, later looping back to the west on January20. Another trough turned the storm southward on January21 and absorbed the circulation the next day.|$|E
