50|$|There {{has been}} much {{discussion}} in the transportation profession concerning how widely adopted TRANSIMS will be, producing several schools of thought.

Subsequently, TRANSIMS would evolve into versions which would be more appropriate for MPOs with smaller staffs and different analysis needs.

30|$|This review {{improves}} upon {{previous work}} and fills {{a gap in}} the knowledge about the measures and strategies for reducing the number of dropouts in vocational education programs by summarizing the main suggestions stemming from previous research. The novelty of this article is that it {{can be used as a}} base from which to design and judge policies and practices for preventing school leaving in vocational training programs. However, the nature of the evidence that we have available and the limitations of this review should be taken with a grain of salt. No strong inferences should be drawn from the results of the analysis, and readers should take caution when interpreting and applying the conclusions of the review. The fact that we took studies from very different contexts (with respective differences in the vocational programs they analyzed and the dropout phenomenon itself) and considered them under the same lens should be noted. Furthermore, we grouped studies that aimed to analyze the effectiveness of various measures with studies that did not have this objective and rather suggested some ideas for how to face the problem of dropouts as <b>a</b> <b>final</b> <b>thought,</b> not as exacting precise measures. However, the rigorous nature of our methodology for searching for, finding, accessing, and analyzing documents, compensates for these shortcomings [which themselves are common in literature reviews in the field of education (Sureda and Comas 2017)].|$|E

Ironically, a committee whose membership has limited ability to truly judge your scholarly standing is often charged with making these decisions.

The rules focus on what might be added to a CV, research statement, personal statement, or cover letter, depending on {{the format of the}} requested promotion materials. In part, the rules suggest that you educate the commit-tee members, who have a range of expertise, on what they should find impor-tant in the promotion application provided by a computational biologist. Further, while some rules are generally applicable, the focus here is on promotion in an academic setting.

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>final</b> <b>thought</b> {{concerning}} {{the size and}} shape of many incised and engraved objects found in the Chumash and Gabrielino territory involves the importance of these variables in understanding social or ceremonial behavior. The objects which have been previously discussed have varied from simple to complex, bulky to fragile, drilled to undrilled, and elaborate to simple designs. The study of the variability in design motif, size, and shape of these incised objects centers on the question: "Does the variability in the elements that make up the object reflect differences in function, customs, norms, or beliefs?" To an extent we could say yes, since a heavy, undrilled, comal-like object would not necessarily have functioned in the same manner as a small, drilled, fragile pendant. However, they both could have been carried, used as status or wealth indicators, and functioned in a ceremonial context. It is possible that the craftsman who manufactured these objects did so at the request of chiefs, shamans, or high-status individuals. However, they may represent the personal artistic freedom of the craftsman, or be manufactured as amorphous forms to be further designed or elaborated on by their owners. If there were soapstone specialists performing the technical aspects of shaping and designing the particular objects based on demand or their own creative, artistic abilities, then the ultimate function of objects such as the one found at Johnson's Landing could have had some relationship to their design motifs, sizes, and shapes...|$|E
