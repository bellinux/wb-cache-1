50|$|A lock is {{a system}} object {{associated}} with a shared resource such as a data item of an elementary type, a row in a database, or a page of memory. In a database, a lock on a database object (a data-access lock) {{may need to be}} acquired by a transaction before accessing the object. Correct use of locks prevents undesired, incorrect or inconsistent operations on shared resources by other concurrent transactions. When a database object with an existing lock acquired by one transaction needs to be accessed by another transaction, the existing lock for the object and the type of the intended access are checked by the system. If the existing lock type does not allow this specific attempted concurrent <b>access</b> <b>type,</b> the transaction attempting access is blocked (according to a predefined agreement/scheme). In practice, a lock on an object does not directly block a transaction's operation upon the object, but rather blocks that transaction from acquiring another lock on the same object, needed to be held/owned by the transaction before performing this operation. Thus, with a locking mechanism, needed operation blocking is controlled by a proper lock blocking scheme, which indicates which lock type blocks which lock type.|$|E

In this paper, we describe recent trends in incidence and prevalence of vascular <b>access</b> <b>types</b> in Europe from 2005 to 2009 and their relationship with patient characteristics and survival. Ten European renal registries participating in the ERA-EDTA Registry provided data on incidence (n = 13, 044) and/or prevalence (n = 75, 715) of vascular <b>access</b> <b>types.</b> We used logistic regression to assess which factors influence the likelihood to be treated with an AVF rather than another type. The use of AVFs {{at the start of}} HD showed a significant decreasing trend from 42 % in 2005 to 32 % in 2009 (P < 0. 0001), while the use of central venous catheters (CVCs) increased from 58 to 68 % (P < 0. 0001). A similar evolution pattern was observed for the prevalence; use of AVFs decreased from 66 to 62 % and use of CVCs increased from 28 to 32 %.

Finally, access density, derived from the proposed access weighting model, was analyzed and correlated with crash rates on National Highway G 205 (South Nanjing section).
