50|$|Chharabra {{is part of}} Shimla Reserve Forest {{sanctuary}} and catchment area. The {{natural vegetation}} comprises pine, oak, cedar or Himalayan deodar, and rhododendron, as well as maple and horse chestnut. The wildlife consists of jackals, kakkar (barking deer), and the occasional leopard, as well as numerous bird species such as the Himalayan eagle, pheasants, chikor and partridges. During monsoons, many wild flower species, wild strawberries and other berries {{can be found in}} forest. Chharabra has good climate for apple cultivation and there <b>are</b> <b>few</b> <b>apple</b> orchards here. Cobra Plant is found in plentiful during monsoons.The Britishers introduced several trees and flowering plants notably Weeping Willows, Silver Oak, Chest Nut, etc. {{from other parts of the}} world that can be seen at Chharabra. The Retreat, Hem Kunj, Dukani, Kalyani House and Wild Flower Hall had weeping willows on their grounds.|$|R

5000|$|The live stock {{according}} {{to both the}} 1850 & 1870 Federal and 1855 NY State census included the production of butter and honey. For 1850, 1855 and 1870 the farm produced 150, 300 and 520 pounds of butter from 2, 3 and then 5 cows. During these years 50 - 75 pounds of honey were produced from beekeeping. The Schencks did not have working oxen or mules, but did have 4 horses. They also kept 4-14 swine for {{all three of the}} census years and 2 sheep. In 1850, there was an apparent attempt to grow sweet potatoes in Western NY, 4 bushels were harvested, the number of acres sown is unknown. The sweat potatoes were not grown in 1855 or 1870. [...] In the November 13th, 1874 surrogates court papers in regards to the year her husband died in 1872, Magdalena states, [...] "I was managing the farm when husband sic died.

50|$|A common {{illustration}} of the MVT is apple picking in humans. When one first arrives at a new apple tree, the number of apples picked per minute is high, but it rapidly decreases as the lowest-hanging fruits are depleted. Strategies in which too <b>few</b> <b>apples</b> <b>are</b> picked from each tree or where each tree is exhausted are suboptimal because they result, respectively, in time lost travelling among trees or picking the hard to find last <b>few</b> <b>apples</b> from a tree. The optimal time spent picking apples in each tree is thus a compromise between these two strategies, which can be quantitatively found using the MVT.|$|R

5000|$|Byrne {{was elected}} as Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1930, {{serving in the}} post for nine {{consecutive}} years. When cycling or walking around the city he dispensed lollipops to children, who were often seen chasing him down the street. With a handshake and a few words for all, his eternal canvassing soon earned him {{the first of his}} nicknames: the Shaking Hand of Dublin. Married with eight children, Byrne treated the people of Dublin as his second family. Every morning he would find up to fifty people waiting for him in the Mansion House. None had appointments. All were met. Byrne answered 15,000 letters in his first year as Lord Mayor. Many were from Dubliners looking for a job, a house, some advice or a reference. One morning in 1931 a journalist watched the Lord Mayor attend to his correspondence. Within an hour he accepted [...] "seventeen invitations to public dinners, one invitation to a public entertainment and eight invitations to public functions." [...] Then he dictated forty-three sympathetic letters to men and women looking for employment. In 1937, {{children between the ages of}} eight and eleven years old were being sentenced to spend up to five years in Industrial Schools. Their crime <b>was</b> stealing a <b>few</b> <b>apples</b> from an orchard. When Byrne said such sentences were [...] "savage," [...] a judge responded with a defence of the Industrial School system, urging an end to [...] "ridiculous Mansion House mummery." [...] Byrne stood firm: [...] "For the punishment of trifling offences the home of the children is better than any institution." [...] In 1938, Byrne was favoured by the press for the presidency of Ireland, a ceremonial role created in the new Constitution, but he was outgunned by the political establishment.|$|R
60|$|On Tuesday, 1st October, we left Florac {{late in the}} afternoon, a tired donkey {{and tired}} donkey-driver. A little way up the Tarnon, a covered bridge of wood {{introduced}} us into {{the valley of the}} Mimente. Steep rocky red mountains overhung the stream; great oaks and chestnuts grew upon the slopes or in stony terraces; here and there was a red field of millet or a <b>few</b> <b>apple</b> trees studded with red apples; and the road passed hard by two black hamlets, one with an old castle atop to please the heart of the tourist.|$|R

At length, too, {{there was nothing more}} to burn, and {{therefore}} they must eat their meat raw, and grew sick on it. Moreover, a cold thaw set in, and the house grew icy, so that they moved about it with chattering teeth, and at night, ill-nurtured as they were, could scarce keep the life in them beneath all the coverings which they had.|$|R

He then told Forester that he had some honey in his wagon, and a <b>few</b> <b>apples,</b> and Forester bought a supply of these. At first, they thought they should not have anything to put the honey in, but Marco ran to the shingle weaver's hut, and got one of the thin pieces which had been split out for shingles, and it made a very good plate. Forester bought a pound of the honey, and half a dozen apples.|$|R

The computer, the IMSAI 8080, may not have made Millard's fortune, but his resulting experiences with the inexperienced and under‑capitalized retailers did. In 1976 (at {{the same time as the}} Byte Shop was selling its first <b>few</b> <b>Apples)</b> he asked his Sales Director, Ed Faber (an ex‑IBM Manager), to start a new franchise operation, soon to become ComputerLand.|$|R

Since the Apple IIGS was the first Apple product to debut in the new gray color they called Platinum, the 20SC had to both match it and the beige color of the Macintosh Plus, which it is designed to sit perfectly beneath. In 1987, all Apple products would change to Platinum, which would remain in use for the next 10 years.|$|R
50|$|This {{cultivar}} has a tart yet sweet taste, {{and keeps}} extremely well, becoming sweeter and mellower-tasting over time.It sweetens in flavor for 5-6 months {{after it is}} picked. The York Imperial is excellent for baking, cooking, apple sauce, cider, preserves, jams, dried apple slices, and juice, as well as eating fresh. It quickly spread from Pennsylvania southward into Virginia. A properly cared for mature tree can average 20 bushels a year. The 'York Imperial' {{is one of the}} <b>few</b> <b>apple</b> cultivars to have survived for 180 years. It is still commonly grown in orchards and backyards in the continental United States, especially Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina. It was often exported to Europe before import restrictions were implemented.|$|R

40|$|Bitter-pit {{has been}} related to {{nutritional}} fruit unbalances, especially to calcium deficiency. In order to elucidate the nutritional and physiological processes that lead to a development of bitter-pit, a nutritional study of a Golden Smoothee/M 9 apple orchard, endemically affected by bitter-pit has been carried out. An evaluation of bitter-pit incidence at harvest showed that only <b>few</b> <b>apples</b> had symptoms, but following two months under cold storage, more than 80 % were affected. Mineral elements in leaves and fruits were analysed. As bitter-pit is associated with fruit size, the diameter and fresh and dry weight of fruits were recorded regularly, and the values fitted to sigmoid equation of growth, to calculate final size and maximum fruit growth rate. In terms of mineral nutrition, Nitrogen relates linearly to calcium and the ratio K/Ca in fruits increases along the season reaching a value of 41 at harvest time. A good correlation between leaf chlorophyll and fruit soluble carbohydrates was found...|$|R
