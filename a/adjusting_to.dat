5|$|After {{six years}} at the Kestrels, the {{defection}} saw Kydd forced {{to adapt to a}} new shooting combination with veteran international Sharelle McMahon. As she had had little opportunity to train with the new team before the opening of the season, the pair initially had some difficulty <b>adjusting</b> <b>to</b> each other's style. After a tenuous start, however, the pair found form, and were able to form a relatively successful combination. Kydd scored 360 goals in the season, and assisted the Phoenix in becoming the top scoring side for the season, although occasionally patchy form from the team as a whole saw the Phoenix slip outside the top two at season's end. Kydd was overlooked for a return to international selection during the 2006–07 season.|$|E

He later attended the University of Wyoming, where he earned both a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts in political science. He subsequently started, but did not finish, doctoral studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.|$|E

5|$|McLachlan found {{success on}} the Fox {{television}} series Millennium, earning several awards {{for his work on}} the show. He was head-hunted for the series by its creator Chris Carter, who had seen his work on the series Strange Luck. McLachlan was initially offered a position shooting Carter's other active series, The X-Files, then in its third season, but was unable to start work in time. He developed a distinctive style for the series, shooting it with desaturated colours and lighting scenes as though they were to be filmed in black and white; he also made use of high-intensity strobe lighting usually employed for advertising and macro cinematography. McLachlan has noted that this style briefly became popular after the series' broadcast but that other cinematographers had difficulty <b>adjusting</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|E

5|$|The ensuing {{worldwide}} plant reduction {{resulting from}} the difficulties plants encountered in <b>adjusting</b> <b>to</b> the new climate caused a progressive fragmentation and collapse of rainforest ecosystems. This reinforced and so further accelerated the collapse by sharply {{reducing the amount of}} animal life which could be supported by the shrinking ecosystems at that time. The outcome of this animal reduction was a crash in global carbon dioxide levels, which impacted the plants even more. The aridity and temperature drop which resulted from this runaway plant reduction and decrease in a primary greenhouse gas caused the Earth to rapidly enter a series of intense Ice Ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by head writer Neil Cross. It was also {{additionally}} written by Ben Richards. The plot of the episode {{was influenced by the}} resurgence of power in Russia following the end of the Cold War, which the producers felt in subtle ways is threatening the security of the West. The producers also included scenes that would show Lucas <b>adjusting</b> <b>to</b> the outside world following eight years of imprisonment, to show how emotionally damaged the character is, and make the audience realise he is struggling. One of the scenes include Lucas struggling to sleep on a bed, and soon resorts to lying on the floor instead.|$|E

Mid-mission, Rogers discovers Romanoff has another agenda: to extract data from the ship's computers for Fury. Rogers returns to the Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, to confront Fury and is briefed about Project Insight: three Helicarriers linked to spy satellites, designed to preemptively eliminate threats. Unable to decrypt the data recovered by Romanoff, Fury becomes suspicious about Insight and asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official Alexander Pierce to delay the project.|$|E

5|$|When Tennyson {{heard on}} 1 October 1833 of his friend's death, {{he was living}} in Somersby, Lincolnshire, in cramped {{quarters}} with his mother and nine of his ten siblings. His father had died in 1831, requiring Tennyson to return home and take responsibility for the family.

Tennyson shared his grief with his sister, Emily, who had been engaged to Hallam.|$|E
5|$|After a {{few weeks}} of {{training}} with Burke, Sing was scouted by All Japan Women (AJW), despite her inexperience. Sing's debut match in Japan was a tag team match with partner Mami Kumano, defeating the Beauty Pair (Jackie Sato and Maki Ueda) in January 1979. In Japan, she began wrestling under the name Monster Ripper. Although she found <b>adjusting</b> <b>to</b> the Japanese culture difficult, Sing held AJW's title on two occasions and was the first Calgary born wrestler to gain success in Japan. During her time in the company, the Japanese female wrestlers gave her a hard time because they did not like losing to foreigners. Sing also had difficulty because of her youth and inexperience in the ring. Sing, however, was comforted by New Japan Pro Wrestling's Dynamite Kid, who had also trained in Calgary. Sing won the WWWA World Single Championship from Jackie Sato on July 31, 1979. Despite losing the title to Sato six weeks later, she regained it on March 15, 1980. The title was vacated in August 1980.|$|E
5|$|Although {{problems}} with sexual function {{that result from}} SCI {{play a part in}} some divorces, they are not as important as emotional maturity in determining the success of a marriage. People with SCI get divorced more often {{than the rest of the}} population, and marriages that took place before the injury fail more often than those that took place after (33% vs. 21%). People married before the injury report less happy marriages and worse sexual adjustment than those married after, possibly indicating that spouses had difficulty <b>adjusting</b> <b>to</b> the new circumstances. For those who chose to become involved with someone after an injury, the disability was an accepted part of the relationship from the outset. Understanding and acceptance of the limitations that result from the injury on the part of the uninjured partner is an important factor in a successful marriage. Many divorces have been found to be initiated by the injured partner, sometimes due to the depression and denial that often occurs early after the injury. Thus counseling is important, not just for managing changes in self-perception but in perceptions about relationships.|$|E
