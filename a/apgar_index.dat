40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the association of <b>Apgar</b> <b>index</b> with that of enamel defects and to explore gender predilection as a co-variable in the formation of enamel defects. Materials and methods: A random sample of 108 individuals (46 boys and 62 girls) aged 4 - 5 years (mean - 4. 4 years) were included in the study. A questionnaire containing subject′s demographic information, <b>Apgar</b> <b>Index</b> (AI), enamel hypoplasia and hypocalcification was collected. Intraoral examination of the subjects was performed by using the type III diagnostic criteria recommended by WHO for oral health surveys. According to the modified index for developmental enamel defects, visual and tactile examinations of the entire primary dentition were performed. The data obtained was analysed using chi-square test. Results: Of all the examined individuals 18 (16. 7 %) showed enamel defects, of which 10 (9. 3 %) were having enamel hypoplasia, 4 (3. 7 %) were having enamel hypocalcification and 4 (3. 7 %) were having both. Correlation of the enamel defects such as hypoplasia, hypocalcification and both had no significant relationship with the gender (P = 0. 36). Conclusion: Subjects with lower <b>Apgar</b> <b>Index</b> exhibited more hypoplastic and hypocalcified teeth both qualitatively and quantitatively. If the Apgar value is less than 6, the vulnerability for the development of enamel defects has considerably increased. Gender of the individuals did not influence the final outcome...|$|E

Methods: retrospective observational study of medical handbooks on the deliveries of pregnant women hospitalized in the CHS from January - February 2007 to August 2008. The variables being studied were: social demographic mother-to-be behavioral characteristics; family history, personal gestational obstetrics overview; deliveries, puerperal data; patient assistance conductibility, clinical development and mother/baby hospital discharge. The statistical analysis which made use of Statistical Package for Social Sciences came to these results: out of the 2122 performed deliveries, 246 patients presented preeclampsia. Hospital admittance being due to: hypertension crisis (31. 30 %), abdominal pain (26. 02 %) and eclampsia (2. 04 %). Hydralazine (15. 85 %) and magnesium sulfate (14. 23 %) were used to control hypertensive and convulsion crisis. Furthermore, gestational age (p = 0. 037) and fifth minute <b>Apgar</b> <b>index</b> of newborns (p = 0. 020) came out significantly higher in patients with no family history of hypertension.

40|$|Preterm {{delivery}} (PD) is {{the most}} important cause of neonatal mortality, particularly before the 32 nd week of pregnancy. A short cervix {{is the most}} important quantitative marker for predicting PD. However, there are other qualitative markers such as cervical gland area, cervical funneling, and sludge. We present the case of a pregnant woman who was diagnosed with a short cervix at 14 -weeks and demonstrate the use of triple therapy, which helped to achieve a good perinatal result. A 37 -year-old pregnant woman (G 3 P 0) was referred to our service at 14 -weeks of pregnancy presenting with a short cervix (20 mm) and a positive sludge sign. She was hospitalized; a pessary was inserted, and started on antibiotic therapy (clindamycin and cefalotin for 10 days). At 20 weeks, she was again admitted to the hospital, and this time presented with a further shortened cervix (9 mm), cervical funneling, and a positive sludge sign, with the pessary in position. The following procedures were performed: Amniocentesis on the sludge (negative bacterioscopy), another cycle of antibiotics, administration of oral progesterone, and imaging to determine retention of pessary position. The patient was placed in the Trendelenburg position and remained hospitalized for 82 days. At 32 + 1 weeks, the fetus presented distress (tachycardia). C-section was performed, producing a live female newborn weighing 2, 180 g and presenting <b>Apgar</b> <b>indexes</b> of 8 / 8.

MÉTODOS: no total, 279 pacientes foram submetidas a dois testes de rastreamento do diabetes gestacional - associação glicemia de jejum e fatores de risco (GJ + FR) e o teste de tolerância à glicose simplificado (TTG 50 g). O rastreamento pela associação GJ + FR caracterizou-se pela dosagem da glicemia de jejum e anamnese para identificação dos fatores de risco na primeira consulta de pré-natal. O TTG 50 g foi realizado entre a 24 ª e a 28 ª semana de gestação e caracterizou-se pela dosagem das glicemias plasmáticas em jejum e uma hora após a sobrecarga oral com 50 g de glicose. Os resultados, positivo e negativo, foram relacionados ao resultado da gestação. Foram consideradas variáveis dependentes: via de parto, idade gestacional, peso e índice ponderal ao nascimento, <b>índices</b> de <b>Apgar</b> PURPOSE: {{to compare}} two screening tests for diabetes and their results to pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: in total, 279 pregnant women were submitted to two screening tests for gestational diabetes - fasting glycemia plus risk factors (FG + RF) {{and to the}} simplified glucose tolerance test (GTT 50 g). Screening by FG + RF consisted of the determination of fasting glycemia and anamnesis for the identification of risk factors {{on the occasion of}} the first prenatal visit. The GTT 50 g was performed between the 24 th and the 28 th week of pregnancy and consisted of the determination of plasma glycemia under fasting conditions and one hour after an oral overload with 50 g glucose. Positive and negative results were compared to pregnancy outcome. The dependent variables were: type of delivery, gestational age, weight and ponderal <b>index</b> at birth, <b>Apgar</b> <b>indexes</b> < 7 in the 1 st and 5 th minutes, need for admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), duration of hospitalization, and neonatal death. Data were analyzed statistically through the Students t-test, and the level of significance was set at 5 %. RESULTS: only two of the perinatal variables studied were distinguished by the tests. An abnormal GTT 50 g was associated with a greater proportion of cesarean deliveries (58. 7 versus 34. 3 %) and a positive FG + RF association was related to a higher rate of premature births (15. 4 versus 5. 4 %). The other dependent variables did not differ among patients with positive and negative results of the two screening tests. CONCLUSIONS: despite the relation between prematurity and a positive FG + RF association, the increase of caesarean sections and the abnormal GTT 50 g, it would be a critical failure to accept these associations as definitive.

Thus, {{the division of the}} term was proposed to fit into three categories: early term, between 37 weeks and 38 weeks and 6 days; full term, between 39 weeks and 40 weeks and 6 days and late term, between 41 weeks and 41 weeks and 6 days. Considering the importance of this issue for the clinical practice, we intended to accomplish the present study, which aimed to analyze the conditions of birth and compare the neonatal outcomes of newborns at term in midsized maternities, in the countryside of the state of São Paulo - Brazil, from 2011 and 2012. This regards across-sectional epidemiological study, which has an analytical approach, and used secondary data of 2455 births. Socio-demographic and obstetrical data were obtained, in order to characterize the mothers. Among the dependent variables we included: height, weight, head circumference and the Röhrer’s Ponderal Index. Significant variables of the babies’ condition in the neonatal period, such as <b>Apgar’s</b> <b>index,</b> complications, need for resuscitation or transfer to more complex services and their conditions, when babies are discharged, were also obtained. Two strategies of analysis were used: in the first, the independent variable, gestational age, was handled in a stratified way (37 - 3839 - 41 full weeks) and in the second, continuously. In statistical analysis, the comparison of maternal characteristics was performed from the Chi-square test. The comparison between newborns of both gestational strata in relation to the dependent variables was conducted by Mann-Whitney or the Chi-square tests. The chance of occurrence of outcomes according to the gestational age was obtained by multiple logistic regression, correcting the effect of the demographic variables, gestational history and current pregnancy.

40|$|Extensive {{literature}} outlined {{that the}} quality of the mother-foetus relationship is considered the main feature with regard to the quality of postnatal mother-infant interaction and also to the child’s psychical development. Nowadays the relationship between the pregnant woman and her foetus is viewed as the central factor of the somatic dialogue between the functioning of the maternal and the foetal organisms. This dialogue is responsible for the physic development of the child, as well as of its psychosomatic structure. Therefore the research area has necessarily had to extend to the analysis of psychological processes concerning: the pregnancy, the couple that is bound by parenthood, the influence of intergenerational dynamics. In fact, the formation of maternal identity, {{as well as that of}} the relationship between the woman and the foetus, refers to the pregnant woman’s relationship with her parents, especially with her mother. The same pregnancy, considered as a psychosomatic event, is directly influenced by relational, affective and social factors, particularly by the quality of the interiorized parental relations and the quality of the current relationships (such as that with her partner and with her family of origin). Some studies have begun to investigate the relationship between the pregnant woman and the foetus in term of “prenatal attachment” and its relationship with socio-demographic, psychological e psychopathological aspects (such as pre and post partum depression), but the research area is still largely unexplored. The present longitudinal research aimed to investigate the quality of the pregnant womanfoetus relationship by the prenatal attachment index, the quality of the interiorized relationship with woman’s parents, the level of alexithymic features and maternity social support, in relation with the modulation of the physiology of delivery and of postpartum, as well as of the physical development of the child. A consecutive sample of 62 Italian primipara women without any kind of pathologies, participated in the longitudinal study. In the first phase of this study (third trimester of the pregnancy), it has investigated the psychological processes connected to the affective investment of the pregnant women towards the unborn baby (by Prenatal Attachment Inventory), the mothers’ interiorized relationship with their own parents (by Parental Bonding Instrument), the social and affective support from their partner and their family of origin are able to supply (by Maternity Social Support Scale), and the level of alexithymia (by 20 -Toronto Alexithymia Scale). In the second phase of this study, some data concerning the childbirth course carried out from a “deliverygram” (such as labour, induction durations and modalities of delivery) and data relative to the newborns state of well-being (such as <b>Apgar</b> and pH <b>indexes).</b> Finally, in the third phase of the study women have been telephoned a month after the childbirth. The semistructured interview investigated the following areas: the memory concerning the delivery, the return to home, the first interactions between the mother and the newborn, the breastfeeding, the biological rhythms achieved from newborns. From the data analysis a sample with a good level of prenatal attachment and of support social and a good capability to mental functioning emerged. An interesting result is that the most of the women have a great percentage of “affectionless control style” with both parents, but data is not sufficient to interpret this result.

MethodsThis is a cross-sectional face-to-face study performed between January 1, 2010 and June 30, 2011. Mothers of premature infants with a gestational age of less than 37 weeks were recruited. Premature infants with any congenital anomaly or severe congenital heart disease were excluded. Controls were mothers of full-term infants with birth weight over 2500  g and without admission to a neonatal intensive care unit. Outcome measures included the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for maternal depressive symptoms, the Family <b>Apgar</b> <b>Index</b> for family support, and the Chinese Maudsley Personality Inventory for personality traits. ResultsA total of 102 mothers of preterm infants and 111 mothers of full-term infants were recruited. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 27. 7 % (59 / 213) in all mothers of this study, 29. 4 % (30 / 102) in mothers of preterm infants, and 26. 1 % (29 / 111) in mothers of full-term infants. Predictors of maternal depressive symptoms included the following: extended family structure, lack of postpartum confinement, low family support, and a personality characterized by neuroticism. ConclusionDepressive symptoms were common among mothers of young children. Family function and neurotic personality were highly correlated with depressive symptoms in mothers caring for young children.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 3, 805 pregnancies followed at Parma General Hospital. Exclusion criteria were cesarean section, preterm delivery, and stillbirth. We analyzed the predictive power of actography during the dilating and expulsive phases of labor by establishing a correlation between number of fetal movements and our neonatal indexes of well being, i. e., cardiotocographic score, <b>Apgar</b> <b>index</b> and neonatal pH value. Statistical tests used were Fisher's test, chi-square test (X 2), Pearson correlation and Spearman Rho; p value was considered significant if it was less than 0. 05. RESULTS: We considered 2, 389 vaginal deliveries. Analyzing the correlation between fetal movement and cardiotocographic score in the two different phases of labor, the comparison among subpopulations identified by different cardiotocograph scores revealed no statistical difference. CONCLUSION: Cardiotocography is reconfirmed as a good instrument to evaluate neonatal outcome, while actigraphy cannot be used alone to define fetal well-being, mainly due to the inability to standardize assessment of the actographic study...|$|E
40|$|Background: The 2008 Wenchuan {{earthquake}} in China resulted in great {{loss of life}} and property, and previous {{studies have focused on}} psychopathological symptoms in survivors after disasters. This study examined perceived family functioning and its predictors in disaster bereaved individuals eighteen months after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Methodology/Findings: This was a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 264 bereaved individuals. The instruments used in the study included Family <b>APGAR</b> <b>Index,</b> Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale??, Emotional and Social Loneliness Scale, and a range of items eliciting demographic characteristics and disaster-related variables. The results indicated that the rates of moderate family dysfunction and severe family dysfunction in bereaved individuals were 37. 1 % and 12. 9 %, respectively. Less financial loss during the earthquake was a significant predictor for positive family function. Better self-rated health status after the earthquake was significantly related to positive family function, cohesion, and adaptability. Scores on family cohesion and adaptability in bereaved individuals from extended or nuclear families were significantly higher than those from single-parent families. The ability to give birth to another baby of bereaved parents was a significant predictor for positive family function and cohesion. Poorer family function, cohesion and adaptability were significantly related to greater loneliness. Conclusions/Significance: This study found a high prevalence of family dysfunction in bereaved individuals eighteen months after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Strategies can be designed to facilitate post-disaster recovery, particularly for the bereaved at high risk for family dysfunction. The study provides useful information for post-disaster rebuilding and relief work. Department of Applied Social SciencesAuthor name used in this publication: Hui Lo, Man-chun Jenny...|$|E
40|$|Abstract AIM: Italy is {{experiencing}} a continuous increase in female immigration and, as a consequence, the number of births by immigrant mothers. The objective of our study was therefore to compare indices for maternal-foetal wellbeing as regards immigrant as opposed to autochthonous pregnant women. METHODS: An analysis was made of CEDAP data from 2001 to 2008 concerning parturients at Udine Obstetric and Gynaecological Clinic, DRG clinical data for 2008 and clinical records for 2008 of foreign parturients: {{the focus was on}} which geographical area they came from, hypertensive and metabolic symptoms during pregnancy, maternal serology, gestational period up to childbirth, weight at birth, <b>Apgar</b> <b>index,</b> duration of hospitalisation for the mother and infant. RESULTS: The study covered 13, 352 women of whom 2, 139 were foreigners, while 363 of the latter gave birth in 2008. In terms of geographical area the largest group of immigrants came from Eastern Europe, followed by sub-Saharan African and Arab countries. The worst outcome of pregnancy was found in African women, who showed the highest incidence of chronic hypertension, pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia and they also developed gestational diabetes more frequently, although a high incidence was also seen for Eastern European and Arab women. Furthermore, African women were found to be HIV-seropositive more frequently, showed a greater tendency to preterm or severely preterm birth, with a significantly lower weight and Apgar at birth compared to all other immigrant women. As a result, African women and infants remained in hospital for a longer period. CONCLUSION: Monitoring, both pre-conceptional and during pregnancy, needs to be intensified, especially among African mothers, {{in order to reduce the}} maternal-foetal disadvantage when compared to other women...|$|E

METHODS: a case-control type study was conducted of 188 neonates, of whom 47 comprised the case group (umbilical arterial pH < 7. 0) and 141 the control (umbilical arterial pH E 7. 1 < 7. 3). The study included only single-gestation neonates without congenital malformations. Both maternal and fetal variables were taken into consideration. Statistical analysis involved the calculation of the raw and adjusted Odds Ratio, Student's t-test, the chi-squared test and multivariate analysis using Enter-method non-conditional logistic regression. The level of statistical significance was set at p< 0. 05. RESULTS: in the case group higher percentages of caesarian sections and pre-term births were observed, involving almost {{five times as much}} intensive care and twenty-five times more likelihood of Apgar in the 5 th minute < 7. No association was observed between the groups and fetal presentation, mother's age, history of miscarriage, years of schooling of mother or attendance at prenatal sessions. After multivariate analysis, the only risk factors that remained significant were complications relating to the placenta or the umbilical cord.

METHODS: 151 pregnant women with diagnosis of blood flow centralization, attended to at the maternity hospital of Universidade Estadual de Campinas, whose delivery occurred up to 15 days after the ultrasonographic diagnosis, were included. It was considered as adverse perinatal outcomes: <b>Apgar</b> <b>index</b> lower than 7 at the fifth minute, permanence in neonatal ICU, small fetus for the gestational age, severe fetal suffering, perinatal death, hypoglycemia, polycythemia, necrotizing enterocolitis, brain hemorrhage, lung hemorrhage, anemia, septicemia, hyaline membrane disease, convulsive syndromes, hyperreflexia syndrome and kidney insufficiency. Rates of the perinatal adverse outcomes (PAO) for the brain-placentary ratios have been compared, using Fisher's exact or Pearson's χ 2 tests, at 5 % significance level. Adverse perinatal outcomes according to the gestational age have been evaluated using the Cochrane-Armitage test for trend.

40|$|Background: To study {{maternal}} {{anxiety and}} perinatal outcomes in pregnant women {{submitted to a}} Multidisciplinary Program for Childbirth and Motherhood Preparation (MPCM). Methods: This is a not randomized controlled trial on 67 nulliparous pregnant women {{divided into two groups}} according to participation (MPCM Group; n = 38) or not (Control Group; n = 29) in MPCM. the program consisted of 10 meetings (between the 18 th and the 38 th gestational week) during which educational, physiotherapeutic and interaction activities were developed. Anxiety was quantified at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the gestational period by the Trace-State Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: Initial maternal anxiety was equivalent between the groups. At the end of the gestational period, it was observed that anxiety levels increased in the Control Group and were maintained in the MPCM Group. A higher occurrence of vaginal deliveries (83. 8 %) and hospital discharge of three-day-older newborns (81. 6 %) as a result of MPCM was also significant. Levels of state-anxiety at the end of pregnancy showed a negative correlation with vaginal delivery, gestational age, birth weight and <b>Apgar</b> <b>index</b> at the first minute and positive correlation with the hospital period remaining of the newborns. Conclusion: in the study conditions, MPCM was associated with lower levels of maternal anxiety, a larger number of vaginal deliveries and shorter hospitalization time of newborns.

The high mortality {{in the delivery room}} and in the first day of life among neonates < 1, 000 g and < 28 weeks gestational age and the absence of survival in neonates < 700 g suggest that care was actively oriented towards newborns with better prognosis. Increased risk of neonatal mortality was associated with maternal residence in slum areas, history of previous cesarean(s), history of induced abortion(s), adolescent motherhood, vaginal bleeding, and lack of prenatal care. Cesarean section and referral of the newborn to the hospital nursery showed protective effects. Birth weight less than 1, 000 g and <b>Apgar</b> <b>index</b> < 7 were associated with increased risk. The high mortality was due to poor living conditions and to maternal and neonatal characteristics. Improvement in prenatal and neonatal care could reduce neonatal mortality in these infants...|$|E

A large-sample survey was to be performed to explore the prevalence of depressive status and related factors in Chinese patients with OSA. From among a randomly-selected group of OSA patients, 1, 327 met inclusion criteria. After screening with the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL- 90) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), patients were assigned to OSA without depressive status (control group, n = 698) and OSA with depressive status (n = 629) groups. Using chi-squared testing, the correlation analyses between the depressive status and OSA patient demographic and clinical variables were tested. Then depression-related risk factors in OSA patients were analysed using stepwise linear regression analysis. The effects of family and social factors on depressive status in OSA patients were investigated using Mann-Whitney U (one of nonparametric test). The prevalence of depressive status was 47. 4 % in OSA patients. Depressive status {{was significantly associated with}} female gender, single status, Family Burden Scale of Disease (FBS), Family <b>APGAR</b> <b>Index</b> (APGAR), apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI), and Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS). Stepwise linear regression analysis further indicated that single status, hypoxemia, APGAR, AHI, PSSS, AHI, and FBS were all risk factors for depressive status in OSA patients. The total of the FBS score and three of its sub-factors scores (family daily activities, family relationships and mental health of family members) were higher, and the total of the APGAR score and two of its sub-factors scores (adaptability and affection) were lower in OSA with depressive status compared with the control group. Besides, the total score for the PSSS and scores for its two sub-factors (family support and social support) were all lower in OSA patients with depressive status than those of the control group.

Retrospectively, pre-gestational health and reproduction status were dealt with, {{as well as the}} course of pregnancy, deliveries, and newborn children (study group). The control group was composed of pregnant women aged 20 to 29, who were identical to study group in terms of parity. Statistical data processing was done by means of 2 -test, and contingency 2 2 tables. The difference was significant if p < 0. 05. Out of 2, 099 diagnosed wanted pregnancies at forty and over, 415 (19. 8 %) had a miscarriage, in 33 (1. 6 %) an artificial abortion was performed after determining the fetus karyotype and 1, 651 (78. 2 %) of pregnant women delivered. In 66. 2 % of pregnancies the fetus karyotype was determined and in 33 (2. 5 %) fetuses chromosomal abnormalities were found. Incidence of deliveries at 40 and over is 1. 38 %, which is a 35. 6 -percent increase in the last ten years. Nullipara and pluripara had an increase, and multipara had a decrease. Pre-gestational health and reproduction status in study group is lower than in control group. Complications during pregnancy: threatened abortion, EPH gestosis, placenta praevia, gestational diabetes, late fetal death are more frequent than in control group (p < 0. 05). In intrapartal terms, more frequent were induction of delivery, meconium-stainedamniotic fluid, fetal distress, operative vaginal deliveries, and Caesarian section (p < 0. 05).

RESULTS: There was no difference between the groups concerning the length of cervical dilation, labor duration, maternal hemodynamic parameters, newborn vitality, analgesic complementation during labor and type of delivery. Analgesia onset was quicker in the CRPA group, and the CPA group presented less motor blockade. Differences concerning adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus and hypotension have not been observed, but hypotension was more frequent in the CPA group (6. 3 versus 3. 1 %). CONCLUSIONS: Both techniques have proved to be safe and efficient, but CRP has provided an earlier onset, with quicker pain relief. The lesser motor blockade in the CPA group has allowed the parturients more active movements in bed and more effective collaboration during the expulsion period. Most women were pleased with the analgesia they got. The doses of local anesthetics and opioids used in both analgesic techniques and the complementary doses, equal in both groups, neither had any significant adverse effect nor affected newborn vitality...|$|E
40|$|A prevalência de anticorpos antifosfolípides em gestantes diabéticas é alta, ocasionando alterações gestacionais e perinatais. O objetivo do estudo foi diagnosticar e tratar as gestantes diabéticas com anticorpos presentes e descrever os resultados gestacionais e perinatais. Foram analisadas 56 gestantes diabéticas que deram entrada no Pré-Natal Especializado do CAISM/Unicamp, entre julho de 2003 a março de 2004. Todas as que aceitavam participar do estudo foram submetidas à coleta de sangue para dosagem de anticorpos antifosfolípides (anticoagulante lúpico e anticorpo anticardiolipina). Se um ou outro anticorpo estivesse presente, a gestante seria tratada com AAS e Heparina. Foram caracterizados os perfis da gestante, da evolução da gestação e do recém-nascido. Foram diagnosticados anticorpos antifosfolípides em 7 % das 56 gestantes e os resultados gestacionais e perinatais foram descritos. Nas gestantes diabéticas com anticorpos antifosfolípides a duração do {{diabetes}} foi de cinco em uma das gestante e dez anos nas outras três gestantes. A idade variou entre 27 e 38 anos e uma das gestantes era primigesta, outra secundigesta e as outras duas multíparas. As gestantes com anticorpos antifosfolípides, que foram tratadas, tiveram resultados gestacional e perinatal satisfatóriosThe {{prevalence of}} antiphospholipid antibodies in pregnant women with pre-gestational diabetes is high, causing gestational and perinatal alterations. The {{purpose of this}} study was to diagnose and treat diabetic pregnant women with presence of antibodies and describe the gestational and perinatal results. An analysis was made of 56 diabetic pregnant women who enrolled in the pre-natal specialization at CAISM/UNICAMP, between July, 2003 and March, 2004. All the diabetic pregnant women who agreed to participate in the study had blood collected for antiphospholipid antibody dosage (lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibody). If any other antibodies were present, the pregnant woman would be treated with Aspirin and Heparin. The following data with reference to the pregnant woman were recorded: age, gestational age, time of diabetes mellitus duration, treatment prior to and during gestation, previous illnesses, hypertension in pregnancy, amniotic liquid index, parturition, way of giving birth, <b>Apgar</b> <b>index,</b> fetal malformation, fetal hypoglycemia and birth weight. Antiphospholipid antibodies were diagnosed in 7 % of the 56 pregnant women and their gestational and perinatal results were described. In the diabetic pregnant women with antiphospholipid antibodies, the duration of the diabetes was from five to ten years, that is to say, pregnant women with long-standing diabetes. The pregnant women with antiphospholipid antibodies ranged from 27 to 38 years of age, and some of the descriptions indicated that they had gone through a bad obstetric experience. The pregnant women with antiphospholipid antibodies, who were treated, had satisfactory gestational and perinatal result...|$|E
40|$|Objetivo: avaliar o efeito do intervalo de tempo entre o nascimento de gêmeos sobre a morbidade e a mortalidade {{neonatal}} do segundo gemelar. Métodos: realizamos um estudo retrospectivo em 50 gemelíparas atendidas na Maternidade Pró-Matre de Vitória que pariram 100 recém-natos vivos, por via vaginal, com peso superior a 500 g e sem malformações maiores. Separamos os recém-natos em G 1 (primeiro gêmeo) e G 2 (segundo gêmeo). Foram considerados como indicativos de morbidade neonatal: asfixia ao nascimento, caracterizada pelo índice de Apgar inferior a 7, no 1 º minuto de vida; síndrome do desconforto respiratório, apurada à luz de dados clínicos e radiológicos, e tempo de internação hospitalar superior a 4 dias. Foi analisada também a mortalidade intra-hospitalar. Quanto ao estudo do intervalo de tempo de parturição entre os gêmeos (deltat), realizamos pontos de corte de 5 em 5 minutos, até 35 minutos. Fizemos, também, análise por faixas de tempo: deltat até 5 minutos, de 6 a 10, de 11 a 15, de 16 a 20 e de 21 a 150 minutos. Resultados: não houve diferença estatisticamente significante (p Purpose: {{to evaluate}} the impact of birth time interval between twins {{in relation to the}} morbidity and mortality of the second newborn twin. Methods: this is a retrospective study of 50 women with twin pregnancy at the `Maternidade Pró-Matre de Vitória' who gave birth to 100 alive newborns through the vaginal canal, weighing each over 500 g and not having any major malformations. The newborns were separated into two groups: G 1 (first twin) and G 2 (second twin). The following criteria were considered to be indicative of newborn morbidity: asphyxia at birth, characterized by <b>Apgar</b> <b>index</b> lower than 7 in the first minute of life; respiratory distress syndrome detected by clinical and radiological findings, and hospitalization period longer than 4 days. In-hospital mortality was analyzed as well. Cut off was at every 5 minutes, up to 35 minutes, to study the time interval between the twin (deltat) delivery. A time-span (deltat) analysis was also carried out up to 5 minutes: 6 - 10, 11 - 15, 16 - 20, and 21 - 150 minutes. Results: there were no statistically significant differences between the second twin's morbidity/mortality in relation to the first, considering the aforesaid cutoff and time-span levels. Conclusion: delivery time interval between G 1 and G 2 did not influence the second twin's morbidity and mortality; however, in the assistance of the second twin's delivery, it is absolutely necessary to individualize the characteristics of each case, not allowing any anxiety to set in through untimely and potentially damaging procedures...|$|E
