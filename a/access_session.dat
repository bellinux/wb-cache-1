In this paper we consider two types of user <b>access</b> <b>sessions,</b> interval sessions and gap sessions.

We conduct empirical performance analysis of the algorithms with web logs ranging from 100 megabytes to 500 megabytes. The empirical analysis shows that the algorithms just take several seconds more than the baseline time, i. e., the time needed for reading the web log once sequentially from disk to RAM, testing whether each user access record is valid or not, and writing each valid user access record back to disk. The empirical analysis also shows that our algorithms are substantially faster than the sorting based session finding algorithms.

50|$|There {{are three}} main {{initiation}} schemes: WLAN scanning initiation, user initiation and remotely managed initiation. In the WLAN scanning-based initiation the user device periodically performs WLAN scanning. When a known or an open Wi-Fi network is found, an offloading procedure is initiated.

This happens usually once per a network <b>access</b> <b>session.</b> In the remotely managed approach, a network server initiates each offloading procedure by prompting the connection {{manager of a}} specific user device. Operator-managed is a subclass of the remotely managed approach. In the operator-managed approach, the operator is monitoring its network load and user behavior.

TINA is a networking architecture being developed by the TINA Consortium, a group of major telecommunication companies, in order to provide a common base for the provision of multimedia services. However, TINA explicitly supports interworking of services and so unless TINA can avoid interactions we jeopardise having fast, reliable service creation. Following a short introduction into TINA, this paper looks at the effects this architecture has on the feature interaction problem. We identified three ways services can interwork within TINA.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{influence}} of previous alcohol (ethanol [EtOH]) -drinking experience on increasing the rate {{and amount of}} future EtOH consumption might be a genetically regulated phenomenon critical to the development and maintenance of repeated excessive EtOH abuse. We have recently found evidence supporting this view, wherein inbred C 57 BL/ 6 J (B 6) mice develop progressive increases {{in the rate of}} binge EtOH consumption over repeated drinking-in-the-dark (DID) EtOH <b>access</b> <b>sessions</b> (i. e., "front loading"). The primary goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate identical parameters in high-alcohol-preferring (HAP) mice to determine whether similar temporal alterations in limited-access EtOH drinking develop in a population selected for high EtOH preference/intake under continuous (24 -hour) access conditions. METHODS: Using specialized volumetric drinking devices, HAP mice received 14 daily 2 -hour DID EtOH or water <b>access</b> <b>sessions.</b> A subset of these mice was then given 1 day access to the opposite assigned fluid on day 15. Home cage locomotor activity was recorded concomitantly on each day of these studies. The possibility of behavioral/metabolic tolerance was evaluated on day 16 using experimenter-administered EtOH. RESULTS: The amount of EtOH consumed within the first 15 minutes of access increased markedly over days. However, in contrast to previous observations in B 6 mice, EtOH front loading was also observed on day 15 in mice that only had previous DID experience with water. Furthermore, a decrease in the amount of water consumed within the first 15 minutes of access compared to animals given repeated water access was observed on day 15 in mice with 14 previous days of EtOH access. CONCLUSIONS: These data further illustrate the complexity and importance of the temporal aspects of limited-access EtOH consumption and suggest that previous procedural/fluid experience in HAP mice selectively alters the time course of EtOH and water consumption...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{visualization}} method based on probabilistic clustering {{in order to}} detect hostile accesses to a Web site. A system administrator is required to monitor {{a huge amount of}} access log data in order to detect novel types of hostile accesses. Our PrototypeLines is a visualization method based on probabilistic clustering with a single parameter that must be tuned and has been successful in medical domain. Thus we believe that PrototypeLines is more attractive than conventional hostile access detection methods based on machine learning since each of the latter methods typically has many parameters that must be tuned. We modify our PrototypeLines for hostile access detection and investigate its performance by experiments with real data. Experimental results show that our method is effective in detecting hostile accesses since it provides a display of a large amount of <b>access</b> <b>sessions</b> in a compact manner emphasizing hostile accesses with warm colors...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand of new services and applications {{is pushing for}} drastic changes {{on the design of}} access networks targeted mainly for residential and SOHO users. Future access networks will provide full service integration (including multimedia), resource sharing at the packet level and QoS support. It is expected that using IP as the base technology, the ideal plug-and-play scenario, where the management actions of the access network operator are kept to a minimum, will be achieved easily. This paper proposes an architecture for access networks based on layer 2 or layer 3 multiplexers that allows a number of simplifications in the network elements and protocols (e. g. in the routing and addressing functions). We discuss two possible steps in the evolution of access networks towards a more efficient support of IP based services. The first one still provides no QoS support and was designed with the goal of reusing as much as possible current technologies; it is based on tunneling to transport PPP sessions. The second one introduces QoS support through the use of emerging technologies and protocols.
