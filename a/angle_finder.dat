40|$|In this paper, {{a set of}} {{efficient}} hydrocyclones {{are designed}} for ultra-fines classification using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique. The CFD model uses Volume of Fluid multiphase model coupled with Reynolds Stress turbulence model for two phase flow predictions. Lagrangian particle-tracking method is used to predict the particle classification. Conventional cylindrical-conical design and various novel cyclone designs having a combination of multiple and small cone <b>angles,</b> tapered vortex <b>finder</b> and different body shapes are considered in this study. Simulation results are presented in terms of mean flow field, pressure drop, flow split, air core diameter, and turbulent intensity levels and particle cut diameter. Predictions show that all the tested novel designs inherently have potential for finer cut separation and higher tangential velocity compared with the conventional design. Multiphase simulations are also carried out for multiple cone angles design and standard design for 15 wt% of solids. Simulations adopted the Algebraic Slip Mixture model modified with shear lift forces and slurry rheology corrected with fines fraction. Performance by multiphase simulation shows that multiple cone angles design and modified small cone angle design are the best among the tested designs suitable for high separation efficiency, smaller cut-point and minimum coarse particle misplacement due to resultant low turbulence intensity levels. Best designs are fabricated further and tested the performance. CFD predicted efficiency curves are found {{in close agreement with}} experiments...|$|R

The CFD model uses Volume of Fluid multiphase model coupled with Reynolds Stress turbulence model for two phase flow predictions. Lagrangian Particle Tracking and Algebraic Slip Mixture model (ASM) modified with shear lift forces and slurry rheology corrected with fines fraction are used to predict the particle classification. Conventional cylindrical-conical design and various novel cyclone designs having a combination of, multiple and small cone <b>angles,</b> tapered vortex <b>finder</b> and air core free designs are considered in this study. Simulation results are presented in terms of mean and turbulent flow field along with particle efficiency' curve. Predictions show that all the tested novel designs are inherently having the potential for finer cut separation and higher tangential velocity compared to the conventional design. Cyclone design with a small cone angle is further modified by placing various sizes of rods at the center axis of the cyclone. Multiphase simulations with modified ASM model are also carried out for the multiple cone angles design, standard design, and the modified small cone angle design with full length rod at 15 wt% of solids. Performance by multiphase simulations show that multiple cone angles design and modified small cone angle design with the full length rod are the best among the tested designs yielding high separation efficiency, smaller cut-point and minimum coarse particle misplacement due to resultant turbulence minimization...|$|R
5000|$|Robot then {{introduced}} the [...] "Junior", an economy model {{with the quality}} and almost all {{the features of the}} [...] "Star" [...] but without the <b>angle</b> <b>finder</b> or the rewind mechanism.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s the company, now called Robot-Berning, {{redesigned}} the Robot Star {{and created the}} Vollautomat Star II. The length stayed the same but the height increased by half an inch. The new higher top housing disposed of the right <b>angle</b> <b>finder</b> and instead included an Albada finder with frames for the factory-fitted 38/40 mm and 75 mm lenses. The drive and shutter too were improved. By 1960 the hallmark stamped steel body was replaced by heavier die castings. The camera became, with slight changes, the Robot Star 25 and Star 50. The Robot Star 25 could expose 25 frames on a single winding, and the double-motor Robot Star 50 could expose 50 frames. Since most Robot cameras by then were sold for industrial use where the camera was fixed in position, Robot also introduced versions without a finder, and even without rewind. Although most production dates from the 1950-1960s era, essentially the same camera continued to be manufactured into the late 1990s.|$|E
40|$|For {{effective}} {{rehabilitation of}} the shoulder, physical therapists must have correct knowledge of shoulder motion. Reports conflict on whether medial or lateral rotation of the humerus accompanies shoulder flexion. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the relationship between flexion and rotation at the glenohu-meral joint. We determined rotation that accompanied active shoulder flexion by using a universal full-circle goniometer and an adjustable wooden bracket that served as a base for a gravity-activated <b>angle</b> <b>finder.</b> Therapists performed passive shoulder flexion with the humerus held allowing no rotation and then held in medial or lateral rotation. We used single-tailed t tests to determine analysis. We found significant differences (p <. 01) between the amount of shoulder rotation accompanying active shoulder flexion between men and women. Medial rotation of the shoulder accompanied active flexion in all subjects. Physical therapists should consider these results when the goal of treatment is to increase shoulder flexion...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} a {{cross-sectional}} reliability study {{with the objective of}} assessing {{the reliability and validity of}} the Electronic Head Posture Instrument (EHPI) in measuring the craniovertebral (CV) angle for subjects with or without neck pain. Twenty-six subjects (mean age = 36. 88, SD ± 9. 95) with chronic neck pain and 27 subjects (mean age = 31. 85, SD ± 7. 63) without neck pain were recruited. The CV angle was measured by the EHPI which consists of an electronic <b>angle</b> <b>finder,</b> a transparent plastic base and a camera stand. Two therapists were recruited to assess the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the EHPI in two separate sessions of measurement. The difference in CV angle between the two groups was determined. The CV angle of the patient group (mean 43. 94, SD ± 3. 61) was significantly smaller (p < 0. 001) than that of the normal group (mean 50. 58, SD ± 2. 09). Intra-rater (intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) ranged from 0. 86 to 0. 94) and inter-rater (ICC ranged from 0. 85 to 0. 91) reliability of the EHPI in measuring CV angle for both groups of subjects were high. In conclusion the EHPI was found to be reliable and valid in measuring the CV angle for subjects with or without neck pain. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Various {{applications}} {{currently available}} for Android allow {{the estimation of}} tree heights by using the 3 D accelerometer on smartphones. Some make the estimation using {{the image on the}} screen, while in others, by pointing with the edges of the terminal. The present study establishes the measurement errors obtained with HTC Desire and Samsung Galaxy Note compared to those from Blume Leiss and Vertex IV. Six series of 12 measurements each were made with each hypsometer (for heights of 6 m, 8 m, 10 m and 12 m). A Kruskall Wallis test is applied to the relative errors to determine whether there are significant differences between the devices. The results indicate that the errors of the uncalibrated smartphones significantly exceed those of traditional forestry apparatus. However, calibration is a very easy procedure that can be done by means of a linear regression line between real angles (obtained with a Digital <b>Angle</b> <b>Finder</b> or with a series of measurements taken independently of the experiment), and the angles of the accelerometer. With this adjustment, the smartphones achieve adequate quality levels although the bias was not totally eliminated. The relative errors when pointing with the edges of the terminal show no significant differences compared to Blume Leiss. Applications that use the screen image give better results (no significant differences were detected with Vertex). There is currently no application that offers calibration of the linear regression slope, which is an essential requirement for ensuring the accuracy of height measurements obtained with smartphones...|$|E
