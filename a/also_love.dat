5|$|As with {{previous}} Valkyira Chronicles games, Valkyria Chronicles III is a tactical role-playing game where players {{take control of}} a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces. Stories are told through comic book-like panels with animated character portraits, with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text. The player progresses {{through a series of}} linear missions, gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked. The route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player's approach: when one option is selected, the other is sealed off to the player. Outside missions, the player characters rest in a camp, where units can be customized and character growth occurs. Alongside the main story missions are character-specific sub missions relating to different squad members. After the game's completion, additional episodes are unlocked, some of them having a higher difficulty than those found {{in the rest of the}} game. There are <b>also</b> <b>love</b> simulation elements related to the game's two main heroines, although they take a very minor role.|$|E
25|$|Like people, fancy mice {{can become}} obese if they overeat {{and do not}} get enough {{physical}} activity. This can lead to them developing life-threatening cardiovascular disorders and diabetes as well as arthritis. Activity aids such as tubes and wheels are great for ensuring mice get enough exercise, as well as mental stimulation. Mice <b>also</b> <b>love</b> to climb, and a wire cage with horizontal bars is perfect for this. A mouse set loose for exercise should be carefully observed, as they tend to scurry into a hiding spot and {{can be difficult to}} retrieve.|$|E
25|$|Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is a {{book that}} has touched many people very deeply since its {{publishing}} in 1923. It has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the American edition alone {{has sold more than}} four million copies. It is considered both by Gibran himself, and by the general public to be his literary masterpiece. The Prophet is about a man who is leaving a small town called Orphalese where he has made his home for the past twelve years. He has, for that time period, been waiting for a boat to take him back to the land of his youth. We are not told where that land is, only that he has been waiting to return there for twelve years. The entire book occurs on the date of his departure. As he is about to leave, the townsfolk stop him in the town and request that he tell them about certain things. He talks to them about life's lessons and imparts his wisdom to them. He is asked about giving, and he tells the people to give without recognition, because their reward is their own joy. He also talks about things like marriage, work, friendship and <b>also</b> <b>love.</b> He speaks about each, and more, describing the way that people should deal with each issue. This book is an interesting book. It is ninety-three pages of life's lessons set down in writing. These are words to live by, and tell others to live by. This book is certainly a book that everyone should read. Even if people don't agree with some of the beliefs, they should still read the book, if only to get their mind thinking about life, and its many quandaries from a different perspective. This book is not unlike the musings of an aging man imparting his life's lessons to an audience of just about anyone whom he can gather to listen to him. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its lessons and stories are wise beyond the ages, and still hold up to be as true today as they were when Gibran wrote them in 1923. The lessons enumerated within this pages are lessons that one would hope were followed by the general population, and I know that if more people read this book, then {{the world as a whole}} might become a more easily survivable place.|$|E

500|$|Brosnan has {{expressed}} contempt for his education by the Christian Brothers. However, in 2013 he commented, [...] "It always {{helps to have}} a bit of prayer in your back pocket. At the end of the day, you have to have something and for me that is God, Jesus, my Catholic upbringing, my faith... God has been good to me. My faith has been good to me in the moments of deepest suffering, doubt and fear. It is a constant, the language of prayer... I might not have got my sums right from the Christian Brothers or might not have got the greatest learning of literature from them but I certainly got a strapping amount of faith." [...] Brosnan attends Mass, but adheres to other spiritual beliefs. In 2008 he said [...] "I <b>also</b> <b>love</b> the teachings of Buddhist philosophy. It's my own private faith. I don't preach it, but it's a faith that is a comfort to me when the night is long." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Circles" [...] {{garnered}} mainly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Andrew Hampp of Billboard was very positive, calling it [...] "the biggest surprise on Lotus, and writing, [...] "'Circles' is Aguilera at her most unapologetic {{and all the}} more delightful for it". 4Music's Chris Younie wrote that, [...] "Aguilera is throwing tonnes of attitude and sass our way". Digital Spy's Robert Cospey praised its lyrics, labelling it [...] "one of their immediate favourites". Caomhan Keane from the website entertainment.ie called it [...] "fun and delicious", while Entertainment Weekly critic Melissa Maerz called it a [...] "sassy kiss-off". Story Gilmore of Neon Limelight was very positive, commenting, [...] "As much as we love Xtina for her incredible voice, we <b>also</b> <b>love</b> her for her feisty personality. The tune is a brilliant mix of genres with a rockstar-worthy chorus". Popjustice writer Same Hine enjoyed the track {{and said that he}} liked it [...] "when Christina gets a bit wobbly and the bubblegum melody sounds oddly good with the lyrics", although it wasn't [...] "her finest pop moment". Mike Wass from Idolator wrote that the song [...] "sounds like fluffiest Nine Inch Nails song ever recorded", also commenting it as [...] "a total trainwreck, but there's something amusing about Xtina putting her haters in their place".|$|E
500|$|There was {{a strong}} {{reaction}} from the show's viewers. Adler said, [...] "I've heard {{from a lot of}} fans how important this character is for them because it's important to watch the internal struggle, the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted." [...] He wants Karofsky to [...] "accept himself and come out because [...] it would be a beacon of hope for everyone else who's struggling", and noted, [...] "people do get hope from Glee." [...] He also said, [...] "I think [...] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is one heck of a compliment from him." [...] Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, [...] "This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But I <b>also</b> <b>love</b> Max and I love that character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending." [...] At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as [...] "very powerful. Chilling, terrifying, horrifying, yet, at the same time, heartbreaking. … Because there are kids who have messaged me since that episode saying they used to hear that line spoken to them {{day in and day out}} at school", and they dreaded school because of it.|$|E

2500|$|Hide of Greeeen openly {{described}} their music genre as J-pop. He said, [...] "I <b>also</b> <b>love</b> rock, hip hop and breakbeats, but my field is consistently J-pop. For example, hip hop musicians learn 'the culture of hip hop' {{when they begin}} their career. We are not like those musicians and we love the music as sounds very much. Those professional people may say 'What are you doing?' but I think that our musical style is cool after all. The good thing is good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ondine is also {{a moving}} love story. [...] As Dorothy Knowles remarks, [...] "Ondine is {{a force of nature}} but <b>also</b> <b>love</b> incarnate, and Hans's tragedy is that he is as unequal to such a love as he is to the revelations of nature which Ondine brings." [...] Laurent LeSage explains, [...] "No {{elemental}} spirit, she is a glimpse of a better and purer world ... But if man dreams of such love which turns life into paradise, he cannot endure its reality." [...] But then LeSage adds, the closing scenes [...] "constitute a remarkably poignant lovers' farewell ... The play closes on a beautiful love poem." ...|$|E

[...] The book inspired Australian entrepreneurs to create a real estate company and name their venture after {{the title of the}} work. Casey Bond wrote for GOBankingRates, [...] "Theoretically, you could just read the list {{at the end of every}} chapter and get the gist of the book, but I find the value of Midas Touch to be in the storytelling of real-life experiences." ...|$|E
2500|$|While hosting Tubridy Tonight, {{he spoke}} of the public's {{perception}} of him, saying: [...] "I think I am a victim of my own image. I think it's been cultivated by others for me. I live in a very ordinary semi-detached house. People only ever see me on a Saturday night on TV and I'm in a smart suit with a book-lined backdrop so that's what they think – you're Johnny smart suit with a book-lined backdrop." [...] Referring to the type of woman he would like, Tubridy said: [...] "I like intelligence, I like a good conversation. I like elegance, I like a girl who is feminine without being vain, I like a little retro in terms of fashion and look and sprinkle it with a little sense of humour. I <b>also</b> <b>love</b> a girl who appreciates darkness. I'm a lot darker than people think – plenty of dark humour." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{it is as}} the KLF {{that they}} {{will go down in}} pop history," [...] wrote Alix Sharkey in 1994, [...] "for a variety of reasons, the most {{important}} being the resolute purity of their self-abnegation, and their visionary understanding of pop." [...] He added: [...] "By early 1992 the KLF was easily the best-selling, probably the most innovative, and undoubtedly the most exhilarating pop phenomenon in Britain. In five years it had gone from pressing up 500 copies of its debut recording to being one of the world's top singles acts." [...] The same piece also quoted Sheryl Garratt, editor of The Face: [...] ""the music hasn't dated. I still get an adrenaline rush listening to it." [...] Garratt believes their influence on the British house and rap scene cannot be overestimated. [...] "Their attitude was shaped by the rave scene, but they <b>also</b> <b>love</b> pop music. So many people who make pop actually despise it, and it shows."" ...|$|E

2500|$|Jemison began {{dancing at}} the age of 11. [...] "I love dancing! I took all kinds of dance — African dancing, ballet, jazz, modern — even Japanese dancing. I wanted to become a {{professional}} dancer," [...] said Jemison. At the age of 14, she auditioned for the leading role of [...] "Maria" [...] in West Side Story. She did not get the part but Jemison's dancing skills did get her into the line up as a background dancer. [...] "I had a problem with the singing but I danced and acted pretty well enough for them to choose me. I think that people sometimes limit themselves and so rob themselves of the opportunity to realise their dreams. For me, I love the sciences and I <b>also</b> <b>love</b> the arts," [...] says Jemison. [...] "I saw the theatre as an outlet for this passion and so I decided to pursue this dream." [...] Later during her senior year in college, she was trying to decide whether to go to New York to medical school or become a professional dancer.
