The historical Horde Hardware building collapsed while a local church was flatted by the winds. In the Florida Keys, hundreds of residences were damaged. The Florida East Coast Railway station at Goulds collapsed. Crop losses was estimated to be $4million and most of its avocado harvest was destroyed. Four people died across the state.|$|E
5|$|In 655, Æthelhere was one {{of thirty}} noble warlords who joined with Penda in an {{invasion}} of Northumbria, laying siege to Oswiu and the much smaller Northumbrian army. The battle was fought on 15 November 655, near the Winwæd, an unidentified river. The Northumbrians were victorious {{and many of the}} Mercians and their allies were killed or drowned. In the battle, Penda <b>and</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> his warlords, including Æthelhere, were killed.|$|E
5|$|Khalid then {{crushed the}} most {{powerful}} threat to the nascent Islamic state of Medina: Musaylimah, a claimant to prophethood, who had already defeated two Muslim armies. In {{the third week of}} December 632, Khalid won a decisive victory against Musaylimah at the Battle of Yamama. Musaylimah died in the battle, <b>and</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> resistance from rebelling tribes collapsed.|$|E

5|$|Lithium {{is found}} in trace amount in {{numerous}} plants, plankton, and invertebrates, at concentrations of 69 to 5,760 parts per billion (ppb). In vertebrates the concentration is slightly lower, <b>and</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> vertebrate tissue and body fluids contain lithium ranging from 21 to 763 ppb. Marine organisms tend to bioaccumulate lithium more than terrestrial organisms. Whether lithium has a physiological role {{in any of these}} organisms is unknown.|$|E
5|$|A large {{section of}} the neighborhood, from around Kentucky Street to Broadway, was razed. Many {{buildings}} south of Lee Street, <b>and</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> south of Avery Street (renamed Cardinal Boulevard) were razed {{for the construction of}} Noe Middle School, expansions to Manual High School and a major expansion of the University of Louisville, as well as to expand local industry east of Floyd Street. From 1965 to 1971, 639 buildings were razed as a part of this effort. However, the plan did spur the restoration of over 100 buildings in other parts of Old Louisville.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect {{that the}} GAO {{investigation}} revealed {{was that the}} training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training was accomplished by reviewing slides on a 35mm projector. Helicopters only made up about 5% of the training slides <b>and</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> the pictures depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because the pictures were provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle, <b>and</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> Western {{scholars}} {{after him}} until the 18th century, believed that creatures were {{arranged in a}} graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to humans: the scala naturae or Great Chain of Being. Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany—the History of Plants—which survived {{as the most important}} contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the Middle Ages. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as carpos for fruit, and pericarpion for seed vessel. Dioscorides wrote a pioneering and encyclopaedic pharmacopoeia, De Materia Medica, incorporating descriptions of some 600 plants and their uses in medicine. Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History, assembled a similarly encyclopaedic account of things in nature, including accounts of many plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland, like {{a growing}} number of Northerners (<b>and</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> white Southerners) saw Reconstruction as a failed experiment, and was {{reluctant}} to use federal power to enforce the 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guaranteed voting rights to African Americans. Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs, he allowed Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C. and appointed another black man (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York judge) to replace Douglass upon his resignation. His decision to replace Douglass with a black man was met with outrage, but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built four {{dams and}} locks {{on the lower}} Snake River to {{facilitate}} shipping. The lower Columbia River has likewise been dammed for navigation. Thus a deep shipping channel through locks and slackwater reservoirs for heavy barges exists from the Pacific Ocean to Lewiston, Idaho. Most barge traffic originating on the Snake River goes to deep-water ports on the lower Columbia River, such as Portland. Grain, mostly wheat, is the main product shipped from the Snake, <b>and</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> of it is exported internationally from the lower Columbia River ports.|$|E

5|$|On Lake Champlain, Benedict Arnold {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of 12 Navy vessels {{to slow down the}} British fleet that was invading New York from Canada. The British fleet did destroy Arnold's fleet, but the U.S. fleet managed to slow down the British after a two-day battle, known as the Battle of Valcour Island, and managed to slow the progression of the British Army. By mid-1776, a number of ships, ranging up to and including the thirteen frigates approved by Congress, were under construction, but their effectiveness was limited; they were completely outmatched by the mighty Royal Navy, <b>and</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> were captured or sunk by 1781.|$|E
5|$|On Lake Champlain, Benedict Arnold {{supervised}} {{the construction of}} 12 vessels to protect access into Hudson River's uppermost navigable reaches from advancing British forces. A British fleet destroyed Arnold's in the Battle of Valcour Island, but the fleet's presence on the lake managed {{to slow down the}} British progression enough until winter came before they were able capture Fort Ticonderoga. By mid-1776, a number of ships, ranging up to and including the thirteen frigates approved by Congress, were under construction, but their effectiveness was limited; they were completely outmatched by the mighty Royal Navy, <b>and</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> were captured or sunk by 1781.|$|E
5|$|One {{civilian}} {{was reported}} {{killed by the}} aircraft strafing of the Tuškanac area of Gornji Grad. None of the three leaders was injured, but four people were wounded in the attack. The facade of the Banski dvori <b>and</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> its rooms were damaged, {{and a part of}} its roof structure was destroyed. The first estimates of the damage inflicted on the building and its contents ranged between 2 and 3million US dollars. Apart from the Banski dvori, other buildings in the area sustained damage. Those included the Croatian Parliament building, the Old City Hall, St. Mark's Church, the Museum of History, the Institute for the protection of cultural monuments as well as residences and offices in the vicinity, including the residence of Swiss consul Werner Mauner.|$|E

Some contributions were made by Stuart Gordon (violin, viola) on three tracks and Manny Elias (drums, percussion) on one track. Peter Hammill's daughters Holly and Beatrice Hammill sing backing soprano voices on two tracks. The instrumentation is dominated by guitars (more as a [...] "colour-wash", as Hammill wrote in his newsletter), keyboards and some strings.|$|R
5|$|Siting of the Ålgård Line from Ganddal to Ålgård {{started in}} 1920. The final cost {{estimate}} was NOK2.82 million {{and the plan}} was passed by Parliament on 20 July 1921, with construction commencing on 21 December. The construction was organized by Just Broch and led by Olaf Bakke. Between 200 and 250 people worked on the line during construction. Because of the recession, the railway works were seen as way to create jobs. Most of the workers came from Stavanger <b>and</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> had families to support. The first train to operate on the line went from Stavanger on 20 December 1924, with the official opening by Minister of Labour Lars Oftedal taking place when it reached Ålgård. The line became the last state-owned railway in Norway to be opened with narrow gauge.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the Dutch East Indies, with over forty {{domestic}} productions released. Following the Japanese occupation in February 1942, production slowed greatly <b>and</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> film studios were closed. The last studio, the ethnic Chinese-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film– Rd Ariffien's Berdjoang (Struggle; 1943)– six short films, and several newsreels. All were pro-Japanese propaganda.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{chemistry of}} boron {{is dominated by}} its small atomic size, and relatively high ionization energy. With only three valence electrons per boron atom, simple covalent bonding cannot fulfil the octet rule. Metallic bonding is the usual result among the heavier congenors of boron but this generally requires low ionization energies. Instead, because of its small size and high ionization energies, the basic structural unit of boron (<b>and</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> of its allotropes) is the icosahedral B12 cluster. Of the 36 electrons associated with 12 boron atoms, 26 reside in 13 delocalized molecular orbitals; the other 10 electrons are used to form two- and three-centre covalent bonds between icosahedra. The same motif can be seen, as are deltahedral variants or fragments, in metal borides and hydride derivatives, and in some halides.|$|E

5|$|These two localities are {{unusual in}} having cliff-top dunes of {{siliceous}} sand: cliff-top dunes are an unusual topographic formation, <b>and</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> {{soil in the}} area is calcareous. As Banksia species are intolerant of calcareous soils, and are not adapted to long range seed dispersal, the two populations of B.epica appear to be reproductively isolated. Nelson has suggested that {{there was once a}} continuous strip of siliceous sand along the coast, providing an extensive and unfragmented habitat for B.epica; rises in the sea level had submerged this strip, leaving only the cliff-top dunes as suitable habitat. The fact that the resultant isolated populations have not perceptibly speciated since then suggests that the species has been fragmented for only a short time, perhaps only since the Last Glacial Maximum.|$|E
5|$|Viking metal {{emerged from}} black metal {{during the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, sharing with black metal an {{opposition}} to Christianity, but rejecting Satanism and occult themes {{in favor of the}} Vikings and paganism. It is similar, in lyrics, sound, and thematic imagery, to pagan metal, but pagan metal has a broader mythological focus and uses folk instrumentation more extensively. Most Viking metal bands originate from the Nordic countries, <b>and</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> bands claim that their members descend, directly or indirectly, from Vikings. Many scholars view Viking metal and the related black, pagan, and folk metal genres as part of broader modern Pagan and neo-völkisch movements as well as part of a global movement of renewed interest in, and celebration of, local and regional ethnicities.|$|E
5|$|After Gordon {{emerged into}} the Atlantic north of Cuba, the National Hurricane Center issued a {{tropical}} storm warning for southern Florida from Jupiter to the Dry Tortugas, and later extended it to Boca Grande up along the west coast; this was extended to Bayport {{on the west coast}} and to Titusville on the east coast while the storm was approaching the Florida Keys. When Gordon attained hurricane status and turned suddenly to the northwest, a hurricane warning was issued from Bogue Banks to the North Carolina/Virginia border. Florida governor Lawton Chiles activated the state's Emergency Operations Center. In the Florida Keys, state parks were closed, which forced some campers to leave, and all schools were closed. On the mainland, University of Miami and Miami Dade College were also closed. Space Shuttle Atlantis was forced to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California instead of Kennedy Space Center. The storm caused flights to be canceled or delayed at Miami International Airport, <b>and</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> flights were canceled to and from the Florida Keys. Hundreds of people evacuated to shelters in five counties in east-central Florida. In North Carolina, officials suggested people in low-lying areas to go to higher ground, but they did not issue evacuation orders.|$|E
