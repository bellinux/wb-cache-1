40|$|It {{is still}} a {{challenge}} for robots to interact with complex environments in a smooth and natural manner. The robot {{should be aware of}} its surroundings and inner status to make decisions accordingly and appropriately. Contexts benefit the interaction a lot, such as avoiding frequent interruptions (e. g., the explicit inputting requests) and thus are essential for interaction. Other challenges, such as shifting attentional focus to a more important stimulus, etc., are also crucial in interaction control. This paper presents a hybrid <b>automatic</b> <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> for interaction, as well as its integration, with these multiple important factors, aiming at performing natural, human-like interactions in robots. In particular, a novel approach of architectural attentional control, based on affection is presented, which attempts to shift the attentional focus in a natural manner. Context-aware computing is combined with interaction to endow the robot with proactive abilities. The long-term interaction <b>control</b> <b>approaches</b> are described.

Despite several attempts,real applications of these techniques in cloud computing infrastructuresface some difficulties.

In thispaper, considering our recent work to build a managementframework dedicated to automatic resource allocation in virtualizedapplications, we attempt to identify from experiments thesources of instabilities in the controlled systems. As examples,we analyze two types of policies: threshold-based and reinforcementlearning techniques to dynamically scale resources. Theexperiments show that both approaches are tricky and thattrying to implement a controller without looking at the waythe controlled system reacts to actions, both in time and inamplitude, is doomed to fail.

For these purposes, {{the introduction to the}} issue of description and modelling of individual components of the whole pilot – aircraft interaction is presented. Based on that, the simulation models obtained from real measured data are designed. However, the acquisition of the real flight data is quite difficult. Therefore, the flight simulator at Brno University of Defence is used {{for the purposes of this}} work. Several experimental measurements were taken using this simulator. These were focused on measuring pilot’s reactions (responses) to visual stimulus with emphasis on obtaining judgements about their current state of training (in terms of dynamic behaviour) as well as attitude to aircraft control. In this phase, two sets of measurements with eight pilots were taken. On average, the pilots had 60 flight hours before the first set of measurements and about 80 flight hours before the second set. The obtained results are analysed using mainly the theory of <b>automatic</b> <b>control</b> <b>approaches</b> in order to evaluate the actual state of pilots’ abilities considering the effects of flight training...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the bi-directional prospective link between automatic alcohol-approach tendencies and alcohol use {{in a group of}} young adolescents (mean age = 13. 6 years). The adolescents {{in the present study were}} assumed to be at-risk of early alcohol use and later problem drinking. It was hypothesized that alcohol use and <b>automatic</b> <b>approach</b> tendencies would reinforce one another particularly in the absence of well-developed inhibition skills. Methods: A total of 347 adolescents (N = 279 at follow-up) from special secondary education, a risk group for the development of substance use problems, participated in the study. <b>Automatic</b> <b>approach</b> tendencies were assessed with the alcohol-approach avoidance task, inhibition skills were assessed with the Stroop task, and alcohol used was measured using a self-report measure. Results: Zero-inflated Poisson analysis revealed a significant effect of <b>automatic</b> <b>approach</b> tendencies predicting alcohol use 6 months later, although only for adolescents with weaker inhibition skills. Conclusions: <b>Automatic</b> <b>approach</b> tendencies predict future drinking behavior of young adolescents with relatively weak inhibition skills.

40|$|Although {{restrained}} eaters {{intend to}} limit their caloric intake, they nevertheless frequently fail and indulge in exactly the foods they want to avoid. Because <b>automatic</b> food-relevant <b>approach</b> tendencies and affective associations may both (independently) contribute to the dysregulation of food intake, {{the present study was}} designed to investigate the importance of both processes in relation to high-fat and low-fat food in restrained and unrestrained eaters. Both restrained and unrestrained eaters demonstrated stronger automatic liking associations with high-fat food than with low-fat food items, whereas a similar pattern was absent in their self-reports of liking food. Interestingly, specifically restrained eaters also displayed relatively strong <b>automatic</b> <b>approach</b> tendencies.

40|$|Objective: Although {{restrained}} eaters {{are motivated}} to control their weight by dieting, they are often unsuccessful in these attempts. Dual process models {{emphasize the importance of}} differentiating between controlled and <b>automatic</b> tendencies to <b>approach</b> food. This study investigated the hypothesis that heightened <b>automatic</b> <b>approach</b> tendencies in restrained eaters would be especially prominent in contexts where food is irrelevant for their current tasks. Additionally, we examined the influence of mood on the <b>automatic</b> tendency to <b>approach</b> food as a function of dietary restraint. Methods: An Affective Simon Task-manikin was administered to measure <b>automatic</b> <b>approach</b> tendencies where food is task-irrelevant, and a Stimulus Response Compatibility task (SRC) to measure <b>automatic</b> <b>approach</b> in contexts where food is task-relevant, in 92 female participants varying in dietary restraint. Prior to the task, sad, stressed, neutral, or positive mood was induced. Food intake was measured during a bogus taste task after the computer tasks. Results: Consistent with their diet goals, participants with a strong tendency to restrain their food intake showed a relatively weak approach bias toward food when food was task-relevant (SRC) and this effect was independent of mood. Restrained eaters showed a relatively strong approach bias toward food when food was task-irrelevant in the positive condition and a relatively weak approach in the sad mood. Conclusion: The weak approach bias in contexts where food is task-relevant may help high-restrained eaters to comply with their diet goal. However, the strong approach bias in contexts where food is task-irrelevant and when being in a positive mood may interfere with restrained eaters' goal of restricting food-intake...|$|R

The self-adaptive component makes the system less sensitive to changing environ-mental conditions. Components for tracking, auto-critical evaluation and automatic parameter regulation serve to detect performance drops that trigger the parameter regulation process. The self-adaptive components re-quire a quality measure based on a statistical scene reference model.
