5|$|Some {{terrestrial}} beetles that exploit shoreline and floodplain habitats have physiological adaptations for surviving floods. In {{the event}} of flooding, adult beetles may be mobile enough {{to move away from}} flooding, but larvae and pupa often cannot. Adults of Cicindela togata are unable to survive immersion in water, but larvae are able to survive a prolonged period, up to 6 days, of <b>anoxia</b> during floods. <b>Anoxia</b> tolerance in the larvae may have been sustained by switching to anaerobic metabolic pathways or by reducing metabolic rate. <b>Anoxia</b> tolerance in the adult Carabid beetle Pelophilia borealis was tested in laboratory conditions and it was found that they could survive a continuous period of up to 127 days in an atmosphere of 99.9% nitrogen at 0°C.|$|E
5|$|One complication—unintentional and unrecognized {{intubation}} of the esophagus—is both common (as frequent as 25% in {{the hands}} of inexperienced personnel) and likely to result in a deleterious or even fatal outcome. In such cases, oxygen is inadvertently administered to the stomach, from where it cannot be taken up by the circulatory system, instead of the lungs. If this situation is not immediately identified and corrected, death will ensue from cerebral and cardiac <b>anoxia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{mechanism}} involves {{effects on}} the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain {{that is responsible for}} effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding. This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing <b>anoxia,</b> lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Donald Canfield {{detected}} {{records of}} the first significant quantities of atmospheric oxygen just before the first Ediacaran fossils appeared– {{and the presence of}} atmospheric oxygen was soon heralded as a possible trigger for the Ediacaran radiation. Oxygen seems to have accumulated in two pulses; the rise of small, sessile (stationary) organisms seems to correlate with an early oxygenation event, with larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second pulse of oxygenation. However, the assumptions underlying the reconstruction of atmospheric composition have attracted some criticism, with widespread <b>anoxia</b> having little effect on life where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} can {{be associated}} with minor complications such as broken teeth or lacerations of the tissues of the upper airway. It can also {{be associated with}} potentially fatal complications such as pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents which can result in a severe and sometimes fatal chemical aspiration pneumonitis, or unrecognized intubation of the esophagus which can lead to potentially fatal <b>anoxia.</b> Because of this, the potential for difficulty or complications due to the presence of unusual airway anatomy or other uncontrolled variables is carefully evaluated before undertaking tracheal intubation. Alternative strategies for securing the airway must always be readily available.|$|E
5|$|All {{species are}} venomous, but only blue-ringed {{octopuses}} have venom that is lethal to humans. Bites are reported each year across the animals' range from Australia {{to the eastern}} Indo-Pacific Ocean. They bite only when provoked or accidentally stepped upon; bites are small and usually painless. The venom appears {{to be able to}} penetrate the skin without a puncture, given prolonged contact. It contains tetrodotoxin, which causes paralysis by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. This causes death by respiratory failure leading to cerebral <b>anoxia.</b> No antidote is known, but if breathing can be kept going artificially, patients recover within 24 hours. Bites have been recorded from captive octopuses of other species; they leave swellings which disappear in a day or two.|$|E
5|$|The {{central nervous}} system {{consists}} of a brain and paired ventral nerve cords that connect to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. The brain is a ring of four ganglia, masses of nerve cells, positioned round the rhynchocoel near its front end – while the brains of most protostome invertebrates encircle the foregut. Most nemertean species have just one pair of nerve cords, many species have additional paired cords, and some species also have a dorsal cord. In some species the cords lie within the skin, but in most they are deeper, inside the muscle layers. The {{central nervous system}} is often red or pink because it contains hemoglobin. This stores oxygen for peak activity or when the animal experiences <b>anoxia,</b> for example while burrowing in oxygen-free sediments.|$|E
5|$|The South Wales Coalfield {{produced}} the sought-after anthracite, bituminous and steam coals—the latter a grade {{between the two}} comprising a hard coal without the coking elements. Some of the region's coal seams contained high quantities of firedamp, a highly explosive gas consisting of methane and hydrogen, and were therefore prone to explosions; firedamp rises into the higher points of workings, including cavities or, as at Senghenydd, when the seams were being mined in an upward gradient. An additional danger of firedamp is afterdamp, a poisonous mixture of gases left after an explosion, primarily constituted of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen. They combine with haemoglobin in the bloodstream to stop cells carrying oxygen, which can result in suffocation by lack of oxygen or <b>anoxia.</b> If survivors from an explosion are not rescued quickly, they face {{the possibility of being}} killed by the gas. The presence of firedamp contributed to a higher-than-average proportion of accidents: between 1880 and 1900 South Wales accounted for 18% of Britain's miners, but 48 per cent of all UK mining deaths occurred in the region. As coal output from British collieries reached its peak in 1913 there was a correspondingly large number of accidents around this time.|$|E
25|$|This {{suggests}} that poisoning from hydrogen sulfide, <b>anoxia,</b> and hypercapnia acted {{together as a}} killing mechanism. Hypercapnia best explains the selectivity of the extinction, but <b>anoxia</b> and euxinia probably contributed to the high mortality of the event. The persistence of <b>anoxia</b> through the Early Triassic may explain the slow recovery of marine life after the extinction. Models also show that anoxic events can cause catastrophic hydrogen sulfide emissions into the atmosphere (see below).|$|E
25|$|The gradual group {{includes}} sea level change, increasing <b>anoxia,</b> and increasing aridity.|$|E
25|$|Evidence for {{widespread}} ocean <b>anoxia</b> (severe {{deficiency of}} oxygen) and euxinia (presence of hydrogen sulfide) is found from the Late Permian to the Early Triassic. Throughout {{most of the}} Tethys and Panthalassic Oceans, evidence for <b>anoxia,</b> including fine laminations in sediments, small pyrite framboids, high uranium/thorium ratios, and biomarkers for green sulfur bacteria, appear at the extinction event.|$|E
25|$|However, in some sites, {{including}} Meishan, China, {{and eastern}} Greenland, evidence for <b>anoxia</b> precedes the extinction.|$|E
25|$|The 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine winner Archibald Hill {{proposed}} in 1924 that the heart was protected from <b>anoxia</b> in strenuous exercise by {{the existence of}} a governor.|$|E
25|$|The rapidity {{with which}} {{premature}} cell death can occur {{depends on the}} cell type and the degree and duration of the <b>anoxia.</b> Haematopoietic cells, in bone marrow, are sensitive to <b>anoxia</b> and {{are the first to}} die after reduction or removal of the blood supply. In anoxic conditions they usually die within 12 hours. Experimental evidence suggests that bone cells composed of osteocytes, osteoclasts, and osteoblasts die within 12–48 hours, and marrow fat cells die within 120 hours. The death of bone does not alter its radiographic opacity nor its mineral density. Necrotic bone does not undergo resorption; therefore, it appears relatively more opaque.|$|E
25|$|This {{spread of}} toxic, oxygen-depleted water {{would have been}} devastating for marine life, {{producing}} widespread die-offs. Models of ocean chemistry show that <b>anoxia</b> and euxinia would have been closely associated with hypercapnia (high levels of carbon dioxide).|$|E
25|$|In {{parts of}} the oceans, {{especially}} the north Atlantic Ocean, bioturbation was absent. This {{may be due to}} bottom-water <b>anoxia,</b> or by changing ocean circulation patterns changing the temperatures of the bottom water. However, many ocean basins remained bioturbated through the PETM.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{a sudden}} decline in sea level, {{intermittent}} periods of ocean-bottom hyperoxia and <b>anoxia</b> (high-oxygen and low- or zero-oxygen conditions) {{may have caused}} the 13C/12C ratio fluctuations in the Early Triassic; and global <b>anoxia</b> may {{have been responsible for}} the end-Permian blip. The continents of the end-Permian and early Triassic were more clustered in the tropics than they are now, and large tropical rivers would have dumped sediment into smaller, partially enclosed ocean basins at low latitudes. Such conditions favor oxic and anoxic episodes; oxic/anoxic conditions would result in a rapid release/burial, respectively, of large amounts of organic carbon, which has a low 13C/12C ratio because biochemical processes use the lighter isotopes more. That or another organic-based reason may have been responsible for both that and a late Proterozoic/Cambrian pattern of fluctuating 13C/12C ratios.|$|E
25|$|The {{sequence}} of events leading to anoxic oceans may have been triggered by carbon dioxide emissions from the eruption of the Siberian Traps. In that scenario, warming from the enhanced greenhouse effect would reduce the solubility of oxygen in seawater, causing the concentration of oxygen to decline. Increased weathering of the continents due to warming and the acceleration of the water cycle would increase the riverine flux of phosphate to the ocean. The phosphate would have supported greater primary productivity in the surface oceans. The increase in organic matter production would have caused more organic matter to sink into the deep ocean, where its respiration would further decrease oxygen concentrations. Once <b>anoxia</b> became established, {{it would have been}} sustained by a positive feedback loop because deep water <b>anoxia</b> tends to increase the recycling efficiency of phosphate, leading to even higher productivity.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there may}} be some weak links in this chain of events: the changes in the 13C/12C ratio {{expected}} to result from a massive release of methane do not match the patterns seen throughout the early Triassic; and the types of oceanic thermohaline circulation that may have existed {{at the end of the}} Permian are not likely to have supported deep-sea <b>anoxia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Environmental cues such as flooding, drought, chilling, wounding, and {{pathogen}} attack can induce ethylene {{formation in}} plants. In flooding, roots suffer {{from lack of}} oxygen, or <b>anoxia,</b> {{which leads to the}} synthesis of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). ACC is transported upwards in the plant and then oxidized in leaves. The ethylene produced causes nastic movements (epinasty) of the leaves, perhaps helping the plant to lose water.|$|E
25|$|Eutrophication, {{excessive}} {{nutrients in}} aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal blooms and <b>anoxia,</b> leads to fish kills, loss of biodiversity, and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses. Excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland, {{as well as}} high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) runoff and leaching from agricultural land. These nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|A second {{extinction}} pulse, the Hangenberg event {{closed the}} Devonian period {{and had a}} dramatic impact on vertebrate faunas. Placoderms mostly became extinct during this event, as did most members of other groups including lobe-finned fishes, acanthodians and early tetrapods in both marine and terrestrial habitats, leaving {{only a handful of}} survivors. This event has been related to glaciation in the temperate and polar zones as well as euxinia and <b>anoxia</b> in the seas.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{chemical}} substances are toxic. Pathogens can produce waterborne diseases in either human or animal hosts. Alteration of water's physical chemistry includes acidity (change in pH), electrical conductivity, temperature, and eutrophication. Eutrophication {{is an increase in}} the concentration of chemical nutrients in an ecosystem to an extent that increases the primary productivity of the ecosystem. Depending on the degree of eutrophication, subsequent negative environmental effects such as <b>anoxia</b> (oxygen depletion) and severe reductions in water quality may occur, affecting fish and other animal populations.|$|E
25|$|The dilemma {{faced by}} C. anderseni {{is to avoid}} {{drowning}} without suffering <b>anoxia</b> or hypercapnia, and they show a remarkable ability {{to adapt to the}} extreme conditions in the mangrove and exploit a niche where the density of other ants is insignificant. By adapting to these hostile situations, mangrove ants have developed the ability to switch to anaerobic respiration. This was proven by the observed oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. Oxygen uptake in the nests eventually stopped, but the carbon dioxide production continued. This indicates high levels of anaerobic respiration.|$|E
25|$|A fish’s hypoxia {{tolerance}} {{can also}} be represented {{as the amount of}} time it can spend at a particular hypoxic PO2 before it loses dorsal-ventral equilibrium (called time-to-LOE), or the PO2 at which it loses equilibrium when PO2 is decreased from normoxia to <b>anoxia</b> at some set rate (called PO2-of-LOE). A higher time-to-LOE value or a lower PO2-of-LOE value therefore imply enhanced hypoxia tolerances. In either case, LOE is a more holistic representation of overall hypoxia tolerance because it incorporates all contributors to hypoxia tolerance, including aerobic metabolism, anaerobic metabolism and metabolic suppression.|$|E
25|$|For such iron-rich {{rocks to}} be {{deposited}} {{there would have}} to be <b>anoxia</b> in the ocean, so that much dissolved iron (as ferrous oxide) could accumulate before it met an oxidant that would precipitate it as ferric oxide. For the ocean to become anoxic it must have limited gas exchange with the oxygenated atmosphere. Proponents of the hypothesis argue that the reappearance of BIF in the sedimentary record is a result of limited oxygen levels in an ocean sealed by sea-ice, while opponents suggest that the rarity of the BIF deposits may indicate that they formed in inland seas.|$|E
25|$|The {{night before}} the 1999 UEFA Cup Final, a video tape was {{released}} which showed Cannavaro being injected with a substance. The substance {{was found to be}} neoton (phosphocreatine), which is used in cardiac surgery to protect the heart during periods of <b>anoxia</b> and stress. It is not on the banned substance list. This chemical is, in partnership with adenosine triphosphate (ATP), fundamental to the ability of the body to produce muscular energy. Phosphocreatine is formed naturally within the body, with over 95% of the compound stored within the muscle cells. The body also receives dietary creatine primarily through the consumption of meat. No action was ever taken regarding this incident.|$|E
25|$|Cold seeps and {{hydrothermal}} vents of deep oceans are {{communities that}} do not rely on photosynthesis for food and energy production. These systems are largely driven by chemosynthetic derived energy. Both systems share common characteristics such {{as the presence of}} reduced chemical compounds (H2S and hydrocarbonates), local hypoxia or even <b>anoxia,</b> a high abundance and metabolic activity of bacterial populations, and the production of autochthonous, organic material by chemoautotrophic bacteria. Both hydrothermal vents and cold seeps show regularly, highly increased levels of metazoan biomass in association with a low local diversity. This is explained through the presence of dense aggregations of foundation species and epizooic animals, living within these aggregations. Community-level comparisons reveal that vent, seep and organic-fall macrofauna are very distinct in terms of composition at the family level, although they share many dominant taxa among highly sulphidic habitats.|$|E
25|$|Since ONJ {{has been}} {{diagnosed}} in many patients {{who did not}} take bisphosphonates, it is thus logical to assume that bisphosphonates {{are not the only}} factor in ONJ. While the oversuppression of bone turnover seems {{to play a major role}} in aggravating the disease process, other factors can and do initiate the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for ONJ. In non-bisphosphonate cases of ONJ, it is mainly the cancellous portion of the bone and its marrow content that are involved in the disease process. The first stage is an oedema of the bone marrow initiated by a bone infarct, which is itself modulated by numerous causes, leading to myelofibrosis as a result of hypoxia and gradual loss of mineral bone density characteristic of ischaemic osteoporosis. Further deterioration can be triggered by additional bone infarcts leading to <b>anoxia</b> and a localized areas of osteonecrosis within the osteoporotic cancellous bone. Secondary events such as dental infection, injection of local anaesthetics with vasoconstrictors, such as epinephrine, and trauma can add further complications to the disease process and chronic non-pus forming bone infection osteomyelitis can also be associated with ONJ.|$|E
25|$|The common {{denominator}} among most deposits of fossil insects and terrestrial plants is the lake environment. Those insects that became preserved were either {{living in the}} fossil lake (autochthonous) or carried into it from surrounding habitats by winds, stream currents, or their own flight (allochthonous). Drowning and dying insects not eaten by fish and other predators settle to the bottom, where they may be preserved in the lake’s sediments, called lacustrine, under appropriate conditions. Even amber, or fossil resin from trees, requires a watery environment that is lacustrine or brackish {{in order to be}} preserved. Without protection in anoxic sediments, amber would gradually disintegrate; it is never found buried in fossil soils. Various factors contribute greatly to what kinds of insects become preserved and how well, if indeed at all, including lake depth, temperature, and alkalinity; type of sediments; whether the lake was surrounded by forest or vast and featureless salt pans; and if it was choked in <b>anoxia</b> or highly oxygenated. There are some major exceptions to the lacustrine theme of fossil insects, the most famous being the Late Jurassic limestones from Solnhofen and Eichstätt, Germany, which are marine. These deposits are famous for pterosaurs and the earliest bird, Archaeopteryx. The limestones were formed by a very fine mud of calcite that settled within stagnant, hypersaline bays isolated from inland seas. Most organisms in these limestones, including rare insects, were preserved intact, sometimes with feathers and outlines of soft wing membranes, indicating that there was very little decay. The insects, however, are like casts or molds, having relief but little detail. In some cases iron oxides precipitated around wing veins, revealing better detail.|$|E

500|$|For {{a period}} of minutes to days after a concussion, the brain is {{especially}} vulnerable to changes in intracranial pressure, blood flow, and <b>anoxia.</b> [...] According to studies performed on animals (which are not always applicable to humans), large numbers of neurons can die during this period in response to slight, normally innocuous changes in blood flow.|$|E
500|$|A final {{alteration}} was to fit {{a simpler}} shutter (radiator vent) which had the object of warming the cockpit by directing heat from the engine. For McCudden this aspect was very important. At high altitude McCudden was to spend {{long periods of time}} in an extremely chilly environment. Operating the D.H.2 in 1916, he suffered terrible agonies as adequate blood circulation returned to his muscles once he reached [...] McCudden reported few general side-effects from high flight. Dizziness was a feature but he put this down to the cold rather than any form of <b>anoxia.</b> High altitude oxygen was too thin for humans which induced breathlessness. Aviation medicine was still in its infancy meaning pilots were left to solve operational problems themselves. Only the high-altitude bombers were equipped with oxygen equipment to assist with breathing. Despite his circulation difficulties, McCudden proved remarkably resistant to the effects of high altitude flying without oxygen.|$|E
500|$|Epaulette sharks have nocturnal {{habits and}} {{frequent}} shallow water on coral reefs or in tidal pools. This shark has evolved {{to cope with}} the severe night time oxygen depletion (hypoxia) in isolated tidal pools by increasing the blood supply to its brain and selectively shutting down non-essential neural functions. It is capable of surviving complete <b>anoxia</b> for an hour without ill effects, and at a much higher temperature than most other hypoxia-tolerant animals. Rather than swim, epaulette sharks often [...] "walk" [...] by wriggling their bodies and pushing with their paired fins. This species feeds {{on a wide range of}} small benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. Epaulette sharks are oviparous, with females depositing pairs of egg capsules around every 14 days from August to December. Due to their hardiness and small size, epaulette sharks are popular with both public and home aquaria. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as of Least Concern, as outside of the small aquarium trade it is of little interest to fisheries.|$|E
2500|$|There is some {{controversy}} over seeding the oceans with iron however, {{due to the}} potential for increased toxic phytoplankton growth (e.g. [...] "red tide"), declining water quality due to overgrowth, and increasing <b>anoxia</b> in areas harming other sea-life such as zooplankton, fish, coral, etc.|$|E
2500|$|A study {{published}} in the journal Science found that during the Great Extinction the oceans' surface temperatures reached , which explains why recovery took so long: it was simply too hot for life to survive. [...] Of course, not all of the Earth's surface was 40°, and if it was simply too hot for life to survive then nothing would have survived. [...] Perhaps <b>anoxia</b> provides another aspect of what delayed the recovery.|$|E
