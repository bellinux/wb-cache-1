5000|$|The Anna Kournikova {{computer}} worm was {{a computer}} worm {{written by a}} Dutch programmer named Jan de Wit on February 11, 2001.

The worm arrives in an email with the subject line [...] "Here you have,0)" [...] and an <b>attached</b> <b>file</b> called AnnaKournikova.jpg.vbs.

5000|$|The Strom Thurmond memo of February 7, 1972, recommending {{deportation}} of John Lennon, {{was addressed}} to Timmons {{in his role as}} assistant to President Nixon.The <b>attached</b> <b>file</b> from the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee associated Lennon with the Chicago Seven and noted that [...] "This group has been strong advocates of the program to 'dump Nixon'." [...] Thurmond told Timmons that [...] "many headaches would be avoided if appropriate action were taken." [...] Timmons responded to Thurmond on March 6, 1972, indicating that the Immigration and Naturalization Service had served a deportation notice on Lennon.The Nixon administration's failed attempt to deport Lennon before the 1972 US presidential election campaign seasonwas illustrated by these memos, which were published in facsimile in 1975 and 2000.|$|E
5000|$|This {{focus on}} the {{possibility}} that emails and other items will ultimately be converted back to Microsoft Mail format is so extreme that if Outlook/Exchange cannot {{figure out a way}} to encode the complete data in the standard format, it simply encodes the entire message/item in a proprietary binary format called Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) and sends this as an <b>attached</b> <b>file</b> (usually named [...] "winmail.dat") to an otherwise incomplete rendering of the mail/item. If the recipient is Outlook/Exchange it can simply discard the incomplete outer message and use the encapsulated data directly, but if the recipient is any other program, the message received will be incomplete because the data in the TNEF attachment will be of little use without the Microsoft software for which it was created. [...] As a workaround, numerous tools for (partially) decoding TNEF files exist.|$|E
5000|$|On February 4, 1972, Thurmond sent {{a secret}} memo to William Timmons (in his {{capacity}} {{as an aide}} to Richard Nixon) and United States Attorney General John N. Mitchell, with an <b>attached</b> <b>file</b> from the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, urging that British musician John Lennon (then living in New York City) be deported from the United States as an undesirable alien, due to Lennon's political views and activism. The document claimed Lennon's influence on young people could affect Nixon's chances of re-election, and suggested that terminating Lennon's visa might be [...] "a strategy counter-measure". Thurmond's memo and attachment, received by the White House on February 7, 1972, initiated the Nixon administration's persecution of John Lennon that threatened the former Beatle with deportation for nearly five years from 1972 to 1976. The documents were discovered in the FBI files after a Freedom of Information Act search by Professor Jon Wiener, and published in Weiner's book Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files (2000). They {{are discussed in the}} documentary film, The U.S. vs. John Lennon (2006).|$|E
