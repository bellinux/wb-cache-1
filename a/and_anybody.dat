5|$|Jabarona {{was filled}} with Dinka {{refugees}} who had fled the fighting {{in the south of}} Sudan and were forced to live together in sub-standard conditions. Bok settled among people who were from the Aweil area of North Bahr al Ghazal and began using his Christian name of Francis once again. Bok was quickly arrested by the Sudanese police for telling his friends and neighbors that he was a slave. Slavery in Sudan is a subject that was largely denied by the government in Khartoum <b>and</b> <b>anybody</b> that spoke of it could be arrested or even killed. Francis was interrogated numerous times while he was imprisoned and each time he denied that he was a slave. He was finally released from prison after seven months. Once he was released Bok decided that he must leave Sudan. Through the help of some Dinka tribesman he was able to acquire a Sudanese passport on the black market and obtain a ticket for passage to Cairo.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2012, {{legal issues}} arose when {{attempts}} were made to digitally re-release the film. G. Vijaya of Vijaya Pictures had filed a lawsuit against Gemini Colour Laboratory and Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures for attempting to re-release the film without her production company's permission. The reason for the suit was that in December 1975, Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures had transferred the entire rights of the film to Movie Film Circuit, which in turn had transferred them to Vijaya Pictures on 18 May 1976. Vijaya Pictures approached the Gemini Colour Laboratory to digitise the film for re-release, however Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures asked laboratory officials not to release the film without their prior consent. Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures also disputed Vijaya's claim by running an advertisement in a Tamil newspaper on 18 May 2012, stating that it was the owner of the film's rights <b>and</b> <b>anybody</b> who wished to exhibit it in digital format should only do so with their permission. R. Subbiah, the judge who presided over the case, ordered the status quo to be maintained by both parties.|$|E

25|$|The Enchiridion symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum {{also known}} as Enchiridion or Denzinger, is a {{compendium}} of all basic texts of Catholic dogma and morality since the apostles. Commissioned by Pope Pius IX, {{it has been in}} use since 1854, and has been updated periodically. It is a compendium of faith, like a catechism. By including all relevant teachings throughout history, it is at the same, more than a catechism. It is a search instrument for theologians, historians <b>and</b> <b>anybody</b> interested in Christian religion. The latest updates of the Enchiridion extend to the teachings of Pope John Paul II.|$|E
25|$|That summer, the two supergroups Soopa Villainz and Drive-By were created. The first, {{consisting}} of Mr. Diamond (Violent J), Mr. Club (Shaggy 2 Dope), Mr. Spade (Esham), and Mr. Heart (Lavel), released Furious in August. The latter, {{consisting of}} Blaze <b>and</b> <b>Anybody</b> Killa, released Pony Down (Prelude) in October. Although Esham had achieved his {{highest level of}} success at Psychopathic, he left the label that month to reform his own label, Reel Life Productions, and the group Soopa Villainz was disbanded. Anybody Killa left the following February. Later that year, Psychopathic Records and hip hop group D12, representing Eminem, ended their rivalry by holding a bowling match.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} years of Prohibition, the new law was {{enforced}} in regions such as the rural South and western states, where it had popular support; however, in large urban cities and small industrial or mining towns, residents defied or ignored the law. The Ku Klux Klan was a major supporter of Prohibition; once it was passed they helped with its enforcement. For example, in 1923, Klansmen traded pistol shots with bootleggers, burned down roadhouses, and whipped liquor sellers, <b>and</b> <b>anybody</b> else who broke the moral code. The Prohibition was effective in reducing per-capita consumption, and consumption remained lower for a quarter-century after Prohibition had been repealed. Sale of alcoholic beverages remained illegal during Prohibition, but alcoholic drinks were still available. Large quantities of alcohol were smuggled into the United States from Canada, over land, by sea routes along both ocean coasts, and through the Great Lakes, and alcohol was diverted from the limited exceptions to the Volsted Act: medicinal and religious. While the federal government cracked down on alcohol consumption on land within the United States, it was a different story along the U.S. coastlines, where vessels outside the 3-mile limit were exempt. In addition, home brewing was popular during Prohibition. Malt and hops stores popped up across the country and some former breweries turned to selling malt extract syrup, ostensibly for baking and beverage purposes.|$|E

500|$|After {{the season}} ended, Berg {{took his first}} trip abroad, sailing from New York to Paris. He settled in the Latin Quarter in an {{apartment}} that overlooked the Sorbonne, where he enrolled in 32 different classes. In Paris he developed a habit he kept {{for the rest of}} his life: reading several newspapers daily. Until Berg finished reading a paper, he considered it [...] "alive" [...] and refused to let anyone else touch it. When he was finished with it, he would consider the paper [...] "dead" [...] <b>and</b> <b>anybody</b> could read it. In January 1924, instead of heading back to New York and getting himself into shape for the upcoming baseball season, Berg toured Italy and Switzerland.|$|E

[...] He {{has been described as}} [...] "genial" [...] by The Mirror Shelley, while fellow Mirror critic Jane Simon has deemed him [...] "shambling" [...] and [...] "not the most convincing medic we've ever seen". Comparing Elliot to fellow cardiothoracic consultant Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing), Bradley explained: [...] "Connie is text book brilliant, whereas Elliot is more inspired. He may seem eccentric but he really listens to his patients - he's very straight forward and not at all stuck up. They are chalk and cheese. Connie's side of the office is very neat and tidy. But Elliot's is a total mess. She's quite uptight, <b>and</b> <b>anybody</b> as relaxed as Elliot really gets on her nerves." [...] On 17 November 2006, Bradley appeared as Elliot in a Children in Need segment featuring the Holby City cast performing a version of [...] "Hung Up" [...] by Madonna.|$|E
2500|$|Tension between Wayne and American rapper, Pusha T, {{had been}} going on for years, {{beginning}} soon after Clipse and Birdman worked on [...] "What Happened to That Boy", the latter's 2002 single. In 2006, Wayne felt the Clipse song [...] "Mr. Me Too" [...] was directed at him which caused more tension between the two. In 2012 after much speculation that Pusha T was subliminally dissing Canadian rapper and Wayne's Young Money signee Drake in several songs, the speculation heightened after the release of Pusha T's [...] "Exodus 23:1" [...] song. Lil Wayne quickly responded on online social networking service Twitter and later released a diss track titled [...] "Goulish". In the first verse Wayne raps [...] "Fuck Pusha T <b>and</b> <b>anybody</b> that love him / His head up his ass, I'mma have to head-butt him". Pusha T has called Wayne's diss track [...] "horrible" [...] and said he felt it didn't deserve a response. Both men have downplayed the feud, with Wayne saying he's over it. However, in late November, Pusha T dissed Wayne and Birdman on a new Ludacris song titled [...] "Tell Me What They Mad For". However, once the feud between Lil Wayne and Birdman arose, Pusha T sent out a tweet encouraging Lil Wayne to sign to G.O.O.D. Music, which also insulted Birdman for his hand-rubbing habit.|$|E
