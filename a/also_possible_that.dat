5|$|Burney was {{reluctant}} to publish the study {{for fear of being}} labeled a cryptozoologist, but eventually published the results in American Anthropologist. Burney concluded that while the villagers had possibly encountered a Malagasy hippopotamus, it was <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the stories were inaccuratea combination of misidentified animals, old folk traditions, and information the villagers had gathered from modern paleontology.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, William {{continued}} his advancement in the kingdom. In 1169 he visited Rome, possibly to answer accusations made against him by Archbishop Frederick, although if so, {{the charge is}} unknown. It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> while Frederick was away on a diplomatic mission in Europe, a problem within the diocese forced William to seek the archbishop's assistance.|$|E

5|$|Their nearest analogies are {{the circles}} found on Dartmoor and Exmoor to the west, and the Stanton Drew stone circles to the north. It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the stone circles {{were linked to}} a number of earthen henges erected in Dorset around the same period.|$|E
5|$|This {{building}} {{may have}} been a later or second hospital. It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> these ruins {{may have been}} part of St Erchard's Church - a.k.a. St Marys' or the Auld Kirk.|$|E
5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His {{frequent}} use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, but it is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E

5|$|Based {{upon the}} {{structure}} of the bill, {{it has been suggested that}} this unique bill was used as a pincer, with the tips of both mandibles touching. The hookbill could have used this movement to pluck fruits or flowers for consumption, or it may have been used to extract snails from their shells. It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the bird could have crushed a snail shell between its mandibles and then used its tongue to ingest the meat and expel the shell out of the open sides of the beak.|$|E
5|$|Danish workers {{involved}} in the clean-up operation claimed long-term health problems resulted from their exposure to the radiation. Although they did not work at Camp Hunziker, the Danes worked at the Tank Farm where the contaminated ice was collected, in the port where the contaminated debris was shipped from, and they also serviced the vehicles used in the clean-up. It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> they were exposed to radiation in the local atmosphere. Many of the workers surveyed {{in the years following}} Project Crested Ice reported health problems. A 1995 survey found 410 deaths by cancers out of a sample of 1,500 workers.|$|E
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E
50|$|It is <b>also</b> entirely <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the {{encryption}} system started from a fundamentally simple cipher and then augmented it by adding nulls (meaningless symbols), homophones (duplicate symbols), transposition cipher (letter rearrangement), false word breaks, and more.|$|R
50|$|His wife {{is likely}} to have been the Singer of Amun Tayuheret, whose mummy was found in the Deir el-Bahri cachette. It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> he had a {{daughter}} called Isetemkheb, since a lady by this name is called the daughter of a high priest on her funerary objects; it is <b>also</b> <b>possible,</b> though, <b>that</b> she was Menkheperre's daughter.|$|R
25|$|It may <b>also</b> be <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> {{continuous}} control efforts, such as routine molluscicides in China, {{which have been}} used to control snails for about fifty years, might have imposed some effect on population genetics of these snails.|$|R
5|$|Edmund {{was born}} either in 1015, 1016 or 1017. Edmund's mother was {{probably}} Ealdgyth, Edmund Ironside's wife; {{it is possible}} that she was only his stepmother, as the king's death in November 1016 left space of only one year for two children to be born. Although {{there is a possibility that}} Edmund was older than his brother, later known as Edward the Exile, it is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> they were twins. At the time, it was customary for posthumous sons to bear their father's name; thus, Edmund could have been the younger, posthumous son.|$|E
5|$|He {{was also}} {{concerned}} by {{reports of the}} invasion of Kiska in the Aleutian Islands in August 1943, in which a large Allied force invaded an island {{that had already been}} evacuated by the Japanese. If this could happen, it was <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> a force might attack where the Japanese were unexpectedly strong. Different levels of command sometimes came up with widely varying estimates of Japanese strength because they used different methods to estimate it.|$|E
5|$|Initially making only {{tentative}} forays onto land, tetrapods {{adapted to}} terrestrial environments {{over time and}} spent longer periods away from the water. It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the adults started {{to spend some time}} on land (as the skeletal modifications in early tetrapods such as Ichthyostega suggests) to bask in the sun close to the water's edge, while otherwise being mostly aquatic.|$|E
50|$|It is <b>also</b> thought <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> Tinnis Castle {{was blown}} up by Lord Fleming, whose father John, 2nd Lord Fleming {{was murdered by}} Tweedie of Drumelzier in 1524 {{as part of a}} longstanding feud between the two families.|$|R

5|$|It is {{possible}} {{that there was a}} facade in front of the chamber, as is evident at other chambered tombs in Britain, such as West Kennet Long Barrow and Wayland's Smithy. It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> there was a portal stone atop the chamber, as was apparent at Kit's Coty House and Lower Kit's Coty House. Many of the larger slabs of stone that have fallen down the slope on the eastern end of the monument may have been parts of this facade or portal.|$|E
5|$|Leonidas' {{actions have}} been the subject of much discussion. It is {{commonly}} stated that the Spartans were obeying the laws of Sparta by not retreating, but it seems it was actually the failure to retreat from Thermopylae that gave rise to the notion that Spartans never retreated. It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that,</b> recalling the words of the Oracle, Leonidas was committed to sacrifice his life in order to save Sparta. However, since the prophecy was specific to him, this seems a poor reason to commit 1,500 other men to a fight to the death.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were {{split on the}} mode of inheritance of white and whether it was deleterious (harmful). Recent research has discovered several possible genetic pathways to a white coat, so disparities in these historical findings may reflect the action of different genes. It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the varied origins of Pulos and Hutt's white horses might {{be responsible for the}} lack of homozygotes. Therefore, it remains to be proven whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state.|$|E

5|$|The Mercians, {{who participated}} in Edwin's defeat in 633, seem to have {{presented}} an obstacle to Oswald's authority south of the Humber, {{although it has been}} generally thought that Oswald dominated Mercia to some degree after Heavenfield. It may have been to appease Oswald that Penda had Eadfrith, a captured son of Edwin (and thus a dynastic rival of Oswald), killed, although it is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> Penda had his own motives for the killing.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{period for}} Giselle is not {{indicated in the}} story. Paul Lormier, the chief costume designer at the Paris Opéra, probably consulted Gautier on this matter. It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> Pillet had the ballet's budget in mind and {{decided to use the}} many Renaissance-style costumes in the Opéra's wardrobe for Giselle. These costumes were said to have been those from Rossini's William Tell (1829) and Berlioz's Benvenuto Cellini (1838). Lormier certainly designed the costumes for the principal characters. His costumes were in use at the Opéra until the ballet was dropped from the repertoire in 1853.|$|E
