40|$|The {{properties}} and subcellular distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enzymes {{involved with the}} synthesis and hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters were investigated in skin of normal and essential fatty acid-deficient rats.

On the other hand, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cholesteryl ester hydrolase (EC 3. 1. 1. 13) is localized in the 105000 g supernatant fraction. Although <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cholesterol-esterifying enzyme(s) was elevated in skin preparations from essential fatty acid-deficient rats, <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrolase was significantly decreased.
