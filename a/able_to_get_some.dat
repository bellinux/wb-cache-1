However, Illingworth made his maiden Test century in his second Test in charge, beat the West Indies and New Zealand 2–0 each and remained captain even when Cowdrey recovered.

The poet's publisher was nervous about publishing the poem, and held it for publication in an expurgated version at a later date.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to show the need of musical study of „Sonsureño”, a popular rhythm from Nariño Department andean region.

By means of his comparative procedures we have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> conclusions which allow us to establish a conceptual basis useful to bring up an academic discussion as far as this musical phenomenon is concerned. Two points related to this rhythm are analyzed: on one hand, its presence in the rural and urban music and, on the other, its arrival to academic music, which has been put in evidence in the music of nariñense composer Javier Fajardo Chaves. Taking into account these two topics, some terms are defined and the object of the study is limited to a specific musical field putting it apart, in this way, from the merely speculative plan in which it has been immersed. Three variants are considered as giving it its rich sonority: Ecuadorian Andes, Colombian Andes and Pacific Coast, originating in this way certain ambiguities in its rhythm and accompaniment...|$|R
