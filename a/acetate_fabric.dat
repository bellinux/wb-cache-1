50|$|The {{breathable}} {{nature of}} the fabric suits it {{for use as a}} lining. <b>Acetate</b> <b>fabric</b> is used frequently in wedding gowns and other bridal attire. Its lustrous sheen and smooth, satiny texture make it a good synthetic alternative to silk.|$|E
50|$|Although Heal Fabrics {{were her}} {{principal}} client, Lucienne also designed textiles for Libertyâ€™s and British Celanese, whose <b>acetate</b> rayon <b>fabrics</b> were marketed by Sanderson during the mid 1950s. She also renewed her earlier associations with Edinburgh Weavers and Cavendish Textiles. Her dress fabrics {{for the latter}} were sold through the John Lewis Partnership.|$|R

50|$|The {{mixing of}} silk and <b>acetate</b> in <b>fabrics</b> was {{accomplished}} {{at the beginning}} and almost at once cotton was also blended, thus making possible low-cost fabrics by means of a fiber which then was cheaper than silk or acetate. Today, acetate is blended with silk, cotton, wool, nylon, etc. to give fabrics excellent wrinkle recovery, good left, handle, draping quality, quick drying, proper dimensional stability, cross-dye pattern potential, at a very competitive price.|$|R
50|$|A {{finishing}} process called S-Finishing or surface saponification is sometimes applied to <b>acetate</b> and triacetate <b>fabrics</b> using a sodium hydroxide solution. This removes part {{or all of}} the acetyl groups {{from the surface of the}} fibres leaving them with a cellulose coating. This reduces the tendency for the fibres to acquire a static charge.|$|R
50|$|The American Cellulose and Chemical Manufacturing Co. Ltd {{plant was}} set up during World War I to produce cheaper fabric for {{airplane}} manufacturing. The plant location was chosen inland to protect against Zeppelin attacks. It was also situated in proximity to a ready source of water at the Potomac River, and easy access to coal supplies and railroad lines. After a series of delays, actual production began in 1924 {{with a series of}} cellulose <b>acetate</b> commercial <b>fabrics</b> and yarns intended as alternatives to silk. The plant was closed in 1983, and was later torn down to provide a space for a new state prison.|$|R
25|$|The {{ball was}} {{constructed}} {{using a new}} design, consisting of eight thermally bonded, three-dimensional panels. These were spherically moulded from ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU). The surface of the ball was textured with grooves, a technology developed by Adidas called GripnGroove that was intended to improve the ball's aerodynamics. The design received considerable academic input, being developed in partnership with researchers from Loughborough University, United Kingdom. The balls were made in China, using latex bladders made in India, thermoplastic polyurethane-elastomer from Taiwan, ethylene vinyl <b>acetate,</b> isotropic polyester/cotton <b>fabric,</b> and glue and ink from China.|$|R
40|$|Finishing using TiO 2 -nanosol {{treatment}} of cellulose <b>acetate</b> (CA) <b>fabrics</b> {{before and after}} the latter were pretreated with H 2 O 2 was undertaken with a view to impart unique properties to CA fabrics, notably, self-cleaning. Finishing was performed as per the pad-dry-cure method. The finishing treatment involved dispersing the nano-sized TiO 2 particles in a mixture of water and ethylene glycol (1 : 1) and application of the dispersions to CA fabrics was made under a variety of conditions. Self cleaning ability of the fabrics is favored by 1) increasing the concentration of TiO 2 -nanosol to certain limit; 2) prolongation of curing time up to 15 second; 3) raising the microwave power from 80 % to 100 % but with the certainty that power of 90 % is the most proper. Besides, exposure time-to UV radiation-up to 90 minutes is essential to have remarkable self cleaning properties while keeping other technical properties, namely, strength, roughness and wettability practically unaltered. Incorporation of binder in the finishing pad-bath helps stabilizing the deposition of TiO 2 with excellent self-cleaning. Pre{{treatment of}} CA fabrics with H 2 O 2 is a pre requisite to guarantee excellent self-cleaning ability. Thermofixation and microwave fixation produces fabrics with very comparable technical properties...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} novel polyfunctionalized acyclic and heterocyclic dye {{precursors}} {{and their respective}} azo (hydrazone) counterpart dyes and dye precursors based on conjugate enaminones and/or enaminonitrile moieties were synthesized. The dyes and their precursors are based on 2 -cyano-N-(3 -cyano- 4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophen- 2 -yl) -acetamide, 2 -ethoxycarbonyl-N-(3 -cyano- 4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophen- 2 -yl) -acetamide or 2 -phenylcarbamoyl-N-(3 -cyano- 4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophen- 2 -yl) -acetamide systems as precursors. The latter compounds were used to synthesize polyfunctional thiophene-, thiazole-, pyrazole, pyridine-, pyrimidine-, oxazine-, as well as acyclic moieties. The dyes and dye precursors were characterized by elemental analysis and spectral methods. All dyes and their precursors were screened in vitro and evaluated for both their antibacterial and antifungal activities. MIC data of the novel dye systems and their respective precursors showed significant antimicrobial activity against most tested organisms. Some compounds exhibited comparable or even higher efficiency than selected standards. Dyes were applied at 5 % depth for disperse dyeing of nylon, <b>acetate</b> and polyester <b>fabrics.</b> Their spectral characteristics and fastness properties were measured and evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Soiling {{characters}} of some fibers are studies through measuring the surface reflective indices of white plain-weaves made of such fibers {{as shown in}} Table I, before and after those fabrics are dipped in the artificial soiling baths which are prepared with carbon-black suspended in carbon-tetrachloride or in the water. The findings are summarized as follows : 1) Generally speaking, spun yarn fabrics are more easily soiled than filament yarn fabrics, especially between those made of chemically homogeneous fibers. Fibers with no curl and those with smooth surface are difficult to be soiled, whereas those with high absorption of water are easily soiled. Some kinds of fibers are found with various soiling characters according to the dispersing agents of the soiling baths; e. g. Amilan (Sample 12, Japanese Nylon- 6) is soiled rather easily when CCl_ 4 is used but is most difficult with H_ 2 O, whereas Vinylon (Sample 11, PVA formal fiber) shows exactly opposite tendency. While in both cases wool (sample 4) is most easy and <b>acetate</b> filament <b>fabric</b> (sample 9) is most difficult to be soiled. 2) Soiling bath with CCl_ 4 as disper sing agent for carbon-black shows stronger soiling quality against fibers than that with H_ 2 O, though this quality is not yet definite {{because of the lack}} of oily materials in the latter case. Extension of dipping time and increase in carbon-black concentration in the soiling bath cause increase in soiling but not proportionally towards certain equilibrium, and this tendency is clear when fabrics are shortly washed in the same dispersing agent after each dipping. The more times samples are tested in the same soiling bath, the higher becomes the concentration of soiling baths, though this tendency shows minimum value at certain range of initial concentration...|$|R
40|$|The {{surface of}} an acrylic fibre {{containing}} about 7 % of vinyl acetate was modified using Fusarium solani pisi cutinase and a commercial esterase, Texazym PES. The effect of acrylic solvents and stabilising polyols on cutinase operational stability was studied. The half-life time of cutinase increased by 3. 5 -fold {{with the addition}} of 15 % N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) and by 3 -fold with 1 M glycerol. The impact of additives and mechanical agitation in the protein adsorption and in the hydrolysis of vinyl <b>acetate</b> from acrylic <b>fabric</b> was investigated. The hydroxyl groups produced {{on the surface of the}} fibre were able to react specifically with Remazol Brilliant Blue R (cotton reactive dye) and to increase the colour of the acrylic-treated fabric. The best staining level was obtained with a high level of mechanical agitation and {{with the addition of}} 1 % DMA. Under these conditions, the raise in the acrylic fabric colour depth was 30 % for cutinase and 25 % for Texazym. The crystallinity degree, determined by X-ray diffraction, was not significantly changed between control samples and samples treated with cutinase. The results showed that the outcome of the application of these enzymes depends closely on the reaction media conditions...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric glow {{discharge}} (AGD) was developed with industrial plasma sources using high voltage radio frequency (RF) excitation at kHz frequency ranges. It {{is possible to}} produce a steady-state uniform {{glow discharge}} at atmospheric pressure with various gases, thus eliminating the requirement of a vacuum system to expose the materials to plasma. The RF frequency should be set in the limited range to produce AGD: if it is too low, the discharge will not initiate {{and if it is}} too high, the plasma will either form a filamentary discharge between the electrode plates or it will be transformed to arc discharge. The advantage of AGD is to modify or coat the materials with good uniformity and making use of the AGD surface modification process, a strong interfacial adhesion can be formed between the constituents and the matrix material. Hence, AGD polymerization may be used to modify the surface properties of Lyocell <b>fabric</b> (<b>acetate</b> taffeta) and polylactic acid (PLA) matrix. In the AGD process, helium is used as a carrier gas and a monomer (acrylic acid) is used to modify the fibre surface properties by plasma polymerization. The reactor is operated at room temperature while the surface is modified at atmospheric pressure. Peel and tensile strength tests and characterizations by SEM were carried out for Lyocell fabric/PLA. Compared to raw fabric, plasma and silane treatments have improved the tensile strength by a maximum of 30. 4 and 27. 4 %, respectively...|$|R
