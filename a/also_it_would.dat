5|$|Robert van Voren {{also says}} Russian {{psychiatry}} {{is now being}} headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times. Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed. In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry {{that was in the}} late 1980s. Russian psychiatrists {{do not have access to}} specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry. Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists. Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid. The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but <b>also</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the Global Initiative on Psychiatry has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years. Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.|$|E
25|$|Other ways of {{assisting}} to {{fill the}} shortage in the United States would include giving nurses the opportunity to pick their own overtime and schedules. <b>Also,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a great incentive to young nurses to enter a hospital if they knew there were bonuses for continued excellence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Also,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> gather over 98% of Serbs of Yugoslavia in one state. In {{his speeches}} and books, Šešelj claimed {{that all of}} the {{population}} of these areas are in fact ethnic Serbs, of Orthodox, Roman Catholic or Muslim faith. However, outside of Šešelj's Serbian Radical Party, the line as such was never promoted in recent Serbian political life.|$|E

25|$|This {{would also}} {{affect the way}} their {{offspring}} looked like in the early instars, resembling earlier ametabolous generations even after they had started {{to adapt to a}} new way of living, in a habitat where they actually could have some good use for flaps along their body. Since they matured {{in the same way as}} thysanurans with plenty of moultings as they were growing and very little difference between the adults and much younger individuals (unlike modern insects, which are hemimetabolous or holometabolous), there probably wasn't much room for adapting into different niches depending on age and stage. <b>Also,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been difficult for an animal already adapted to a niche to make a switch to a new niche later in life based on age or size differences alone when these differences were not significant.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{much has been}} {{discovered}} about amusia. However, there remains {{a great deal more}} to learn. While a method of treatment for people with amusia has not been defined, tone differentiation techniques have been used on amusic patients with some success. It was found with this research that children reacted positively to these tone differentiation techniques, while adults found the training annoying. However, further research in this direction would aid in determining if this would be a viable treatment option for people with amusia. Additional research can also serve to indicate which processing component in the brain is essential for normal music development. <b>Also,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be extremely beneficial to investigate musical learning in relation to amusia since this could provide valuable insights into other forms of learning disabilities such as dysphasia and dyslexia.|$|E
25|$|During {{the tenure}} of mayor Dragan Đilas (2008–13), the idea of {{expanding}} the zoo to Donji Grad, which it occupied prior to the World War II, resurfaced, but the experts were against it. The urban plan for the fortress from 1965 already projected the complete relocation of the zoo outside of the fortress, {{on some of the}} suburban locations, which in later plans included Veliko Blato, Stepin Lug or Jelezovac. The expansion of the zoo would cut the pedestrian communication between the Danube's and Sava's parts of the fortress, which was already cut in 1949 but was restored in 2009 with the reconstruction and opening of the Sava Gate. <b>Also,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> prevent the exploration of Donji Grad, which is still largely unexplored and leave the Gate of Charles VI, a masterpiece of Balthasar Neumann, within the zoo itself. As of 2017, the zoo was not relocated but the idea of expansion was dropped, too.|$|E

500|$|However, dwindling {{interest}} in Nepenthes {{at the turn}} of the century saw the demise of the Veitch Nurseries and consequently the loss of several species and hybrids in cultivation, including N. northiana and N. rajah. [...] By 1905, the final N. rajah specimens from the Veitch nurseries were gone, as the cultural requirements of the plants proved too difficult to reproduce. The last surviving N. rajah in cultivation at this time was located at the National Botanic Gardens at Glasnevin in Ireland, however this soon perished <b>also.</b> <b>It</b> <b>would</b> be many years before N. rajah was reintroduced into cultivation.|$|E
2500|$|Another Shia sect, the Zaidiyyah {{followers}} of Zaid ibn Ali, generally has 2 views about that. Some branches such as Jaroudiah (Sarhubiyya) don’t accept Umar and Abu Bakr as legitimate caliphs. For instance, Jarudiyya {{believes that the}} apostle of Allah appointed Ali ... and believes that the denial of the Imamate of Ali after passing away of Prophet Muhammad will be led to infidelity and <b>also</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> lead to deviation from the right path. The other view accepts Umar and Abu Bakr as legitimate caliphs, despite their beliefs that they are inferior to Ali. According to al-Tabari (and Ibn A'tham), when asked about Abu Bakr and Umar, Zayd ibn Ali replied: [...] "I have not heard anyone in my family renouncing them both nor saying anything but good about them...when they were entrusted with government they behaved justly with the people and acted according to the Qur'an and the Sunnah.".|$|E
