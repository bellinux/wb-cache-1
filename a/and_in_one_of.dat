5|$|On September 30, 1977, Amway {{bought the}} network. Soon after the purchase, Mutual began {{developing}} {{what would become}} the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity. In 1979, Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of Labor. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year—950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS. It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year New Zealand reciprocated and toured Australia. Windon played twice for the New South Wales Waratahs against the touring All Blacks, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the two test matches. The tour {{was treated as}} a trial for Australia's 1947–48 tour of Europe and North America that commenced later that year. Windon played 27 matches on the 36-match tour, and in all five test matches: against Scotland, Ireland, Wales, England and France. The Wallabies did not concede a try in any of their four Home Nations matches.|$|E

5|$|Wilbur {{started the}} fourth and last flight at just about 12 o'clock. The first few hundred feet were up and down, as before, {{but by the time}} three hundred ft had been covered, the machine was under much better control. The course for the next four or five hundred feet had but little undulation. However, when out about eight hundred feet the machine began {{pitching}} again, <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its darts downward, struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be 852 feet; the time of the flight was 59 seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken, but {{the main part of the}} machine was not injured at all. We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or two.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{incident}} that closed his railroad, Walt Disney consulted with Roger Broggie about the concept of including his ridable miniature train in a potential tour of Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, north of Downtown Los Angeles. Broggie, believing {{that there would be}} limited visitor capacity for the attraction, recommended to Disney that he make the train bigger in scale. The idea of a studio tour was eventually replaced by the idea of an amusement park named Disneyland {{across the street from the}} studio, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its first design concepts at that proposed location, a miniature steam train ride was included, as well as a larger, narrow-gauge steam railroad attraction. During this time, Disney proposed that the narrow-gauge Crystal Springs & Southwestern Railroad, which the nearby Travel Town Museum in Griffith Park planned to build, be extended to run through Disneyland. Planned construction of the Ventura Freeway across land between the two sites, and rejection by the Burbank City Council of a new amusement park in their city, led Disney to look for a different location to build the park and its narrow-gauge railroad.|$|E

25|$|Wavelet {{transforms}} {{are also}} {{starting to be}} used for communication applications.

Wavelet OFDM can achieve deeper notches than traditional FFT OFDM, and wavelet OFDM does not require a guard interval (which usually represents significant overhead in FFT OFDM systems).|$|E

25|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} was originally recognized by {{law as a}} result of cases in which courts in eight out of ten of Canada's provinces, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its three territories, ruled existing bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional.

25|$|Gillows {{was owned}} by the family until 1814 when it {{was taken over by}} Redmayne, Whiteside, and Ferguson; they {{continued}} to use the Gillow name. Gillows furniture was a byword for quality, and other designers used Gillows to manufacture their furniture. Gillows furniture is referred to by Jane Austen, Thackeray and the first Lord Lytton, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas. In 1903 Gillows merged with Warings of Liverpool to become Waring and Gillow and although the furniture remained of a high quality it was not as prestigious.|$|E

Representative matches against MCC and a full-strength international side assembled by T. N. Pearce for the Scarborough festival were also lost. And the Indians became the first touring side to lose against the Minor Counties representative side since the West Indian cricket team in England in 1928, largely as a result of a remarkable unbeaten 202 by Phil Sharpe that enabled the Minor Counties to reach a target of 334 with only four wickets lost.|$|E
25|$|Together with Keith Mann and Danny Attwood, Horne {{was part}} of a small Animal Liberation Front cell that raided Harlan Interfauna, a British company in Cambridge that {{supplies}} laboratory animals and organs, on 17 March 1990, Horne's 38th birthday. The activists entered Interfauna's animal units through holes they punched in the roof, removing 82 beagle puppies and 26 rabbits. They also removed documents listing Interfauna's customers, which included Boots, Glaxo, Beechams, and Huntingdon Research Centre, {{as well as a number}} of universities. A vet who was an ALF supporter removed the tattoos from the dogs' ears, and they were dispersed to new homes across the UK. As a result of evidence found at the scene <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the activists' homes, Mann and Attwood were convicted of conspiracy to burgle and were sentenced to nine months and 18 months respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{income from}} the office of the Ordinary was {{irregular}} in both forms and payment. He received a salary of £35 and two, three or four 'freedoms' to the city each year (which could be sold for about £25 each) from the City of London, earned from interests on various bequests and his house on Newgate Street was clear of the land tax. But he had other opportunities of profit beside his salary and usual gifts: several Ordinaries exploited their position to publish religious guides and individual recounts of lives of notorious malefactors. Evidence suggests that the {{income from the}} Accounts must have been substantial too: many criminals refused to confess their crimes {{on the grounds that the}} Ordinary would profit from them, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Ordinary's Accounts one Charles Brown alluded to how every number of the Accounts earned him £25, which the Ordinary didn't deny.|$|E
