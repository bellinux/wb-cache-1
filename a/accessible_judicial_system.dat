40|$|The {{urgency of}} {{considering}} problems of modern Russian <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> and <b>judicial</b> policy is emphasized. The author proves {{the necessity to}} study the <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> of our country in detail. The content of <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> is analyzed and its structural elements are described. Factors determining the structure of national <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> are characterized. The main feature of the Russian <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> is noted, notably: centralization (there is no independent judicial authority in regions except constitutional justice). Considering the <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> as hierarchically structured set of courts is too simplified and is not conformable to modern justice tasks. The ways of optimizing the system of courts {{as well as the}} <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> of the Russian Federation are proposed. Interim results of the reform in the form of abolishment of the RF Supreme Arbitration Court are negatively evaluated. Intraorganizational transformations have substituted the evolutionary development of the <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> and the necessity to improve the justice itself. The author confirms that development of relevant draft bill was not accompanied by conducting public researches, studying statistical data, and making general conclusions, proving the efficiency of establishing an integrated supreme court. Threats and challenges to law order are ignored. Supreme courts integration has virtually established a new <b>judicial</b> <b>system,</b> though the proper legal base for it has not been developed. The viewpoints of researchers, warning against negative effects of such reform, are provided. It is concluded that the law under study does not meet present demands of the Russian <b>judicial</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

40|$|In many Sub-Saharan countries, {{customary}} and statutory <b>judicial</b> <b>systems</b> co-exist. Customary {{justice is}} exercised by clan leaders or local courts, {{and based on}} restorative principles. By contrast, statutory justice is mostly retributive and administered by magistrates’ courts. As {{the jurisdiction of the}} customary and the statutory systems often overlap, victims can choose which <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> to refer to, which may lead to contradictions between rules and inconsistencies in judgments. In this essay, we construct a model representing a dual <b>judicial</b> <b>system.</b> We show that the overlap of competence encourages rent-seeking and bribery, and yields to high rates of petty crimes and civil disputes. We recommend the subsidization of the statutory <b>judicial</b> <b>system,</b> as it efficiently improves deterrence and incapacitation in the dual <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> while minimizing corruption of customary judges. We illustrate our theoretical predictions by discussing the functioning of the Ugandan dual <b>judicial</b> <b>system.</b> Belgian French speaking communit...|$|R

40|$|The role of <b>judicial</b> <b>systems</b> in {{determining}} economic perfonnance has gained increasingly attention in recent years. Nonetheless, the literature lacks a clearly articulated framework {{to examine how}} <b>judicial</b> <b>systems</b> influence the investment and production decisions of economic agents. This paper tries to till in this gap. It examines what constitutes a well-functioning judiciary, analyzes how dysfunctional <b>judicial</b> <b>systems</b> compromise economic growth, and reviews the relevant empirical literature. It concludes with some remarks about why, despite the widespread perception that well-functioning legal and <b>judicial</b> <b>systems</b> are key {{to the success of}} market-oriented reforms in developing and transition countries, judicial refonn has lagged so much behind other reforms...|$|R

40|$|Where {{will the}} Dutch <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> be in 2015 ? One of us {{answered}} a similar type of question elsewhere with {{a sketch of}} two frightening scenarios. * In the first scenario the <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> will have insufficiently adapted itself to its surroundings. The <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> will become more intensively involved in a decreasing amount of cases that gradually carry less weight. The <b>judicial</b> <b>system,</b> as a social phenomenon, will be marginalized even though the traditional standards of constitutional legitimacy and professionalism of the administration of justice are kept up. Interesting or big cases will be handled outside the judiciary by special courts or through arbitration, mediation {{or other forms of}} “alternative dispute resolution” (ADR). The large amount of bulk cases will be transferred to other legal areas or authorities where the involvement of the judge will decrease (for example the Mulderizing of criminal cases, or settlement by the Public Prosecutor). With the decrease in jurisdiction the authority of the <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> will decline and eventually prise itself out of the market. In the second frightening scenario the <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> will have adapted itself too much to its surroundings. Van Gunsteren once sketched a picture of the court as a dynamic centre for settling conflicts, a place where the experts fall over each other with seminars, workshops, courses, and new methods. Instead of settling conflicts they get copied within the judicial organization itself. † The <b>judicial</b> <b>system,</b> with its well-meaning efforts at being responsive, will have distanced itself from its core duties: settling disputes through binding judgments. While the <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> has lost touch with its surroundings in the first scenario, it has lost its own self in the second scenario...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} article, author {{considers}} {{the place of}} judicial reform of 1864 in the public and social reforms of Alexander II. This paper attempts to show the place of justice {{in the legal system}} of Russian Empire in the post-reform period. Author emphasizes democratic and progressive nature of judicial reform of 1864, noting lack of preconditions for the formation of democratic <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> under the autocracy. Author analyzes relationship and development of the <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> and the dynamics of social relations. Author also revealed the way of <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> in the formation of civil society prerequisites. This paper attempts to show and prove that judicial reform is actually a first step towards the formation of the Russian system of powers separation.

In conclusion, author concludes that in the present conditions of <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> democratization in modern Russian Federation a number of principles and institutions of judicial reform of 1864 was applied...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> performance {{to economic development}} has been actively probed in recent years. Yet efforts to improve <b>judicial</b> <b>systems</b> have faltered. This paper offers an explanation. It proposes that transacting within social networks has provided a seemingly workable substitute for reliance on <b>judicial</b> <b>systems</b> in Brazil and many countries. This prompts public indifference to <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> improvement. At the same time, where social network transacting is widespread and dominant, it presents numerous obstacles to economic development. Transactions costs economics provides tools for better understanding the characteristics, costs and extent of social network transacting. Relatively low costs are found for intra-network transacting, but trans-network transacting suffers. Constraints inherent in both social network transacting and in judicial dysfunction are reviewed for their negative impacts on both domestic activity and regional integration. Selected transactions costs economics literature is reviewed {{for a closer look}} at firm size and corporate governance in the context of countries like Brazil where <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> dysfunction is found and where social network transacting is prominent. A recently completed project inside the 400 state courthouses of the São Paulo regional tribunal is reported. It shows how close attention to administrative details can significantly improve <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> performance. The paper mixes real world observation with theoretical insights. It suggests that current explanations for sluggish economic development would be better served by increased awareness of social network transacting. It suggests that research within courthouses at a deeper level of detail will advance understanding of the negative consequences of <b>judicial</b> <b>system</b> dysfunction on specific aspects of economic development...|$|R
