The traders would obtain their goods from stores in Taos or Santa Fe then return to sell the hides obtained in trade with the Native American thus making the Taos Mountain Trail conduit more important. To aid the trade, Bent's Fort was built in 1833 and El Pueblo Trading Post followed in 1842. Traders headquartered in Bent's Fort and El Pueblo went out to trade with goods from Taos. The Taos Mountain Trail continued in use as it provided quick access to a settled community.|$|E

500|$|After {{spending}} much of 1980 on the road, Zappa released Tinsel Town Rebellion in 1981. It {{was the first}} release on his own Barking Pumpkin Records, and it contains songs taken from a 1979 tour, one studio track and material from the 1980 tours. The album {{is a mixture of}} complicated instrumentals and Zappa's use of sprechstimme (speaking song or voice) — a compositional technique utilized by such composers as Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg—showcasing some of the most accomplished bands Zappa ever had (mostly featuring drummer Vinnie Colaiuta). While some lyrics still raised controversy among critics, in the sense that some found them sexist, the political and sociological satire in songs like the title track and [...] "The Blue Light" [...] have been described as a [...] "hilarious critique of the willingness of the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> believe anything". The album is also notable for the presence of guitarist Steve Vai, who joined Zappa's touring band in late 1980.|$|E

In his campaign announcement speech, Goldwater justified his candidacy by stating that he had [...] "not heard from any announced Republican candidate a declaration of conscience or of political position that could possibly offer to the American people a clear choice in the next presidential election." [...] He emphasized the need for a federal government that is [...] "limited and balanced and against the ever increasing concentrations of authority in Washington" [...] that encourages personal responsibility among American citizens while pledging his candidacy to [...] "victory for principle and to presenting an opportunity for the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> choose."

500|$|In what {{historian}} Robert R. Russell {{calls the}} [...] "Calhoun Doctrine", Calhoun {{argued that the}} Federal Government's role in the territories was only that of the trustee or agent of the several sovereign states: it was obliged not to discriminate among the states and hence was incapable of forbidding the bringing into any territory of anything that was legal property in any state. Calhoun argued that citizens from every state {{had the right to}} take their property to any territory. Congress and local voters, he asserted, had no authority to place restrictions on slavery in the territories. As constitutional historian Hermann von Holst noted, [...] "Calhoun's doctrine made it a solemn constitutional duty of the United States government and of the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> act as if the existence or non-existence of slavery in the Territories did not concern them in the least." [...] The Calhoun Doctrine was opposed by the Free Soil forces, which merged into the new Republican Party around 1854. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney based his decision in the 1857 Supreme Court case Dred Scott v. Sandford, in which he ruled that the federal government could not prohibit slavery in any of the territories, upon Calhoun's arguments. However, moderates at this time rejected these beliefs, and Taney's decision became a major point of partisan attack by the Republican Party.|$|E

500|$|... 1988 was the bicentenary of {{non-indigenous}} {{settlement in}} Australia and, as such, there was {{renewed interest in}} the 'lost' second Sydney punchbowl. The bowl eventually turned up in a catalogue for a Chinese export porcelain exhibition at Newark Museum, New Jersey, United States, titled Chinese Export Porcelain: A Loan Exhibition from New Jersey Collections. The bowl had been lent by Peter Frelinghuysen Jr., a former United States Congressman (in office 1953–1975). The discovery was made by Terry Ingram, a Sydney journalist specialising in antiques and art, who wrote about it in his Saleroom column, titled Newark Museum packs Aussie punch, in The Australian Financial Review on 25August 1988. It transpired {{that in the early}} 1930s, the bowl was acquired by Frelinghuysen's parents in a private negotiation with the owner at the time the National Art Collections Fund was attempting to raise interest from Sydney's cultural institutions. This discovery drew the attention of Paul Hundley, senior curator of the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM)'s USA Gallery, the Gallery itself a bicentennial gift of the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> Australia. In May 2006, the ANMM announced it had acquired the bowl as a part gift from Frelinghuysen through the American Friends of the ANMM, a charitable organisation recognised by the US Internal Revenue Service which enabled Frelinghuysen to receive appropriate taxation benefits. The Australian Financial Review reported the acquisition in its Saleroom column, titled Museum bowled over, on 18May 2006. The punchbowl has been on display in the Museum's USA Gallery ever since. It also features as one of the 100 Stories from the ANMM, has digitised images in the ANMM catalogue and can be viewed on YouTube. At the time the ANMM acquired the punchbowl in 2006, the bowl was valued at $A330,000.|$|E
