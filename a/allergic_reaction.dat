5|$|Body {{piercing}} jewellery should be hypoallergenic. A number of materials are used, with varying strengths and weaknesses. Surgical stainless steel, niobium and titanium {{are commonly used}} metals, with titanium {{the least likely to}} cause <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction</b> of the three. Platinum and palladium are also safe alternatives, even in fresh piercings. Initial piercings should never be done with gold of any grade, as gold is mixed with other metals, and sterling silver is not a good alternative in a piercing, as it may cause allergies in initial piercings and will tarnish in piercings of any age. An additional risk for <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction</b> may arise when the stud or clasp of jewellery is made from a different metal than the primary piece.|$|E
5|$|For a {{small number}} of people, taking aspirin can result in {{symptoms}} resembling an <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction,</b> including hives, swelling, and headache. The reaction is caused by salicylate intolerance and is not a true allergy, but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an overdose.|$|E
50|$|Prednisolone {{can also}} be used for <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> ranging from {{seasonal}} allergies to drug <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions.</b>|$|R
30|$|Release of ions {{can cause}} {{discoloration}} of the adjacent soft tissues, <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions,</b> or pain. The released ions {{can also cause}} toxic and biological side effects [4, 5]. Nickel can cause <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> [2]. <b>Allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> to chromium released from orthodontic components have also been reported [6, 7]. Aside from the <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions,</b> release of ions may even cause cytotoxic effects, mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis [8, 9].|$|R
50|$|It {{may cause}} <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> {{in those who}} are {{sensitive}} to sulfites, including respiratory reactions in asthmatics, anaphylaxis and other <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> in sensitive individuals.|$|R
5|$|In some instances, {{recurrent}} mouth ulcers may be {{a manifestation}} of an <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction.</b> Possible allergens include certain foods (e.g., chocolate, coffee, strawberries, eggs, nuts, tomatoes, cheese, citrus fruits, benzoates, cinnamaldehyde, and highly acidic foods), toothpastes, and mouthwashes. Where dietary allergens are responsible, mouth ulcers usually develop within about 12–24 hours of exposure.|$|E
5|$|Like other platinum-group metal, bulk Pd {{is quite}} inert. Although contact {{dermatitis}} has been reported, {{data on the}} effects are limited. It {{has been shown that}} people with an <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction</b> to palladium also react to nickel, making it advisable to avoid the use of dental alloys containing palladium on those so allergic.|$|E
5|$|Reactions to {{the ants}} sting show similar {{symptoms}} to fire ant stings; namely local swelling which lasts for several days, and {{swelling of the}} lips, face and eyes may occur from a minor <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction.</b> Other common symptoms include watering of the eyes and nose, and hives or welts will begin to develop. Headaches, anxiety and flushing may also occur. Jack jumpers, bees and wasps {{are the most common}} causes of anaphylaxis from insect stings. People most commonly feel a sharp pain after these stings, similar to that from an electric shock. Some patients develop a systemic skin reaction after being stung. Localised envenomation occurs with every sting, but severe envenoming only occurs if someone has been stung many times (as many as 50 to 300 stings in adults). The heart rate increases, and blood pressure falls rapidly. Most people will only experience mild skin irritation after being stung. Those who suffer from a severe <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction</b> will show a wide variety of symptoms. This includes difficulty breathing and talking, the tongue and throat will swell up, and coughing, chest tightness, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting may occur. Others may lose consciousness and collapse (sometimes people may not collapse), and confusion. Children who get stung will show symptoms such as floppiness and paleness if a severe <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction</b> occurs.|$|E
50|$|The {{most serious}} side effects, {{although}} rare, are <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions.</b> Some {{of the patients}} experienced the symptoms of <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions,</b> including difficulty breathing, confusion, facial swelling, fainting, dizziness, hives or chest pain. <b>Allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> are medical emergencies and individuals who experience them are advised to seek immediate medical care {{in order to prevent}} further complications.|$|R

50|$|Chemically curable glass ionomer cements are {{considered}} safe from <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> {{but a few}} have been reported with resin-based materials. Nevertheless, <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> are very rarely associated with both sealants.|$|R
5|$|Some {{susceptible}} {{individuals have}} experienced an <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction</b> after touching Suillus americanus. The symptoms of {{allergic contact dermatitis}} generally develop one to two days after initial contact, persist for roughly a week, then disappear without treatment. Cooking the fruit bodies inactivates the responsible allergens.|$|E
5|$|If {{no signs}} of an <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction</b> are present, an ice pack or commercially {{available}} sprays are used to relieve the pain. Stingose is also recommended to treat a jack jumper sting. Other treatments include washing the stung area with soap and water, and if continuous pain remains for several days, antihistamine tablets are taken for one to three days.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Malory becomes {{temporally}} blinded {{after having}} an <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction</b> to zucchini. Seeing {{this as an}} opportunity to help themselves, secretary Cheryl and human resources representative Pam hack into the ISIS computer mainframe from Malory's office and alter their files, allowing them better health care and other perks they can not afford themselves. The whole time, Malory rants about how disgruntled she is about her own and others' life choices.|$|E

40|$|Background: Studies have {{demonstrated}} that families of children with food allergy have significant deficiencies in their {{knowledge of how to}} avoid allergen exposure and how to manage <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions.</b> This study aims {{to assess the impact of}} a multidisciplinary paediatric allergy clinic consultation on parental knowledge of food allergy and to determine the rate of subsequent <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions.</b> Methods: Sixty-two subjects (< 17 years) referred with food allergy were prospectively enrolled. Parental knowledge was assessed by questionnaire and EpiPen trainer. Families saw a paediatric allergist, clinical nurse specialist and dietician. Knowledge was reassessed after 3 months and rate of <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> after 1 year. Results: After one visit to the paediatric allergy clinic, there was a significant improvement in parental knowledge of allergen avoidance (26. 9 %, P < 0. 001), managing <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> (185. 4 %, P < 0. 0001) and EpiPen usage (83. 3 %, P < 0. 001). Additionally, there was a significant reduction in <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> (P < 0. 001). Children with egg, milk or multiple food allergies were more likely to suffer subsequent reactions. Conclusions: A single visit to a multidisciplinary allergy clinic considerably improves families' abilities to manage <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> to foods with an accompanying reduction in <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions.</b> Young children with egg, milk or multiple food allergies were at greatest risk of further reactions...|$|R
5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} practices emphasize {{the use of}} safe {{body piercing}} materials, frequently utilizing specialized tools developed for the purpose. Body piercing is an invasive procedure with some risks, including <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction,</b> infection, excessive scarring and unanticipated physical injuries, but such precautions as sanitary piercing procedures and careful aftercare are emphasized to minimize the likelihood of encountering serious problems. The healing time required for a body piercing may vary widely according to placement, from {{as little as a}} month for some genital piercings to as much as two full years for the navel.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} {{treatment}} for a Myrmecia sting depends on {{the severity of the}} reaction. If no signs of an <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction</b> are seen, an ice pack or commercially available spray is used to relieve the pain. Washing the stung area, stingose, and the use of antihistamine tablets are other methods to reduce the pain. Indigenous Australians use bush remedies to treat Myrmecia stings, such as rubbing the tips of bracken ferns onto the stung area. Carpobrotus glaucescens is also used to treat stung areas, using juices that are squeezed and rubbed onto the area, which quickly relieves the pain from the sting.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} {{is needed in}} a case of a severe <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction.</b> Before calling for help, laying a person down and elevating the legs is suggested. Depending on a patients needs, they will be given an EpiPen or an Anapen to use in case they are stung. In a scenario of experiencing anaphylaxis, further doses of adrenaline and intravenous infusions may be required. Some with severe anaphylaxis may suffer cardiac arrest and will need resuscitation. Inhalers may additionally be used in case a victim has asthma and experiences a reaction from a sting. The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended, as it is known to increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Medications like antihistamines, H2 blockers, corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes have no effect on anaphylaxis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> {{can develop}} to {{tetrazepam}} {{and it is}} considered to be a potential allergen. Drug rash and drug-induced eosinophilia with systemic symptoms is a known complication of tetrazepam exposure. These hypersensitive <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> can be of the delayed type.|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to {{conclude}} by citing two rather interesting observations we have made. Three-quarters of all the patients in all our surveillance who have <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> to drugs have had peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, or neoplastic disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Of these patients, three-quarters of the drugs producing <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> are administered orally. The rates of <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> to individual drugs in patients with gastrointestinal disease {{as opposed to those}} without gastrointestinal disease receiving the same medication, are significantly increased. What the impact is of inflammatory gastrointestinal disease 1) upon the absorption of the drug, 2) upon its metabolism, and 3) upon its antigenicity has not been investigated before. But from these studies it is suggested that inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract may be an important factor predisposing patients receiving oral drugs to occurrence of <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions.</b> It has commonly been supposed that patients with autoimmunological disorders, e. g., system lupus erythematous, may have a predisposition to multiple <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> to drugs. In our evaluation of this problem, there is no significant increase in the occurrence of <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> to drugs in these patients...|$|R
5|$|Some {{people suffer}} from <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> after {{handling}} onions. Symptoms can include contact dermatitis, intense itching, rhinoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchial asthma, sweating, and anaphylaxis. <b>Allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> may not occur when eating cooked onions, possibly {{due to the}} denaturing of the proteins from cooking.|$|R
5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{known what}} {{specific}} agent in the body brings about the <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction</b> to the radiation. When patients with SU were injected with an irradiated autologous serum, many developed urticaria within the area of injection. When {{people who did not}} have SU were injected, they did not demonstrate similar symptoms. This indicates that the reaction is only a characteristic of the patients with solar urticaria and that it is not phototoxic. It is possible that this photoallergen is located on the binding sites of IgE that are found on the surface of mast cells. The photoallergen is believed to begin its configuration through the absorption of radiation by a chromophore. The molecule, because of the radiation, is transformed resulting in the formation of a new photoallergen.|$|E
5|$|More {{problems}} ensued during filming: Paul Le Mat {{was sent}} to the hospital after an <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction</b> to walnuts. Le Mat, Harrison Ford and Bo Hopkins were claimed to be drunk most nights and every weekend, and had conducted climbing competitions {{to the top of the}} local Holiday Inn sign. One actor set fire to Lucas's motel room. Another night, Le Mat threw Richard Dreyfuss into a swimming pool, gashing Dreyfuss' forehead on the day before he was due to have his close-ups filmed. Dreyfuss also complained over the wardrobe that Lucas had chosen for the character. Ford was kicked out of his motel room at the Holiday Inn. In addition, two camera operators were nearly killed when filming the climactic race scene on Frates Road outside Petaluma. Principal photography ended on August 4, 1972.|$|E
5|$|There are {{side effects}} and risks {{associated}} with the smallpox vaccine. In the past, about 1 out of 1,000 people vaccinated {{for the first time}} experienced serious, but non-life-threatening, reactions, including toxic or <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction</b> {{at the site of the}} vaccination (erythema multiforme), spread of the vaccinia virus to other parts of the body, and to other individuals. Potentially life-threatening reactions occurred in 14 to 500 people out of every 1 million people vaccinated for the first time. Based on past experience, it is estimated that 1 or 2 people in 1 million (0.000198 percent) who receive the vaccine may die as a result, most often the result of postvaccinial encephalitis or severe necrosis in the area of vaccination (called progressive vaccinia).|$|E

5|$|Adler's throat closes {{up during}} the MRI due to an <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction</b> to gadolinium, {{prompting}} two members of House's team, Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), to perform a tracheotomy. Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient {{is a man who}} is orange because of an over-consumption of carrots and mega-dose vitamins (niacin). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticises the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis, despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure. The team brings her back with a defibrillator.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} is only needed {{if a person}} is showing signs of a severe <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction.</b> Prior to calling for help, stung persons should be laid down, and their legs elevated. An EpiPen or an Anapen is given to people at risk of anaphylaxis, to use in case they are stung. If someone experiences anaphylactic shock, adrenaline and intravenous infusions are required, and those who suffer cardiac arrest require resuscitation. Desensitisation (also called allergy immunotherapy) is offered to those who are susceptible to M. pilosula stings, and the program has shown effectiveness in preventing anaphylaxis. However, the standardisation of M. pilosula venom is not validated, and the program is poorly funded. The Royal Hobart Hospital and the Royal Adelaide Hospital are the only known hospitals to run desensitisation programs. During immunotherapy, patients are given an injection of venom under the skin. The first dose is small, but dosage gradually increases. This sort of immunotherapy is designed to change how the immune system reacts to increased doses of venom entering the body.|$|E
5|$|Often {{considered}} a poor {{relation of the}} cep (Boletus edulis), the bay bolete is nevertheless highly regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors such as Carluccio. In central Mexico, it is collected from Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park and sold in neighbouring markets. It may cause an <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction</b> in some people, and the blue discolouration upon bruising can be offputting, although the staining disappears from white flesh when it is cooked. The flavour is milder than its better-known relative. Younger specimens are best for eating, though more mature ones can be suitable for cutting up and drying. The tendency for the pores to absorb water means that wiping rather than washing is recommended before use in the kitchen. Unlike most boletes, I.badia can be eaten raw (though only young mushrooms should be used). Otherwise it can be fried in butter, or used with meat or fish recipes. Mushrooms can also be frozen, dried, or pickled in cider vinegar, wine, or extra virgin olive oil, and later used in sauces or soups.|$|E
