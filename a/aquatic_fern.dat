Melbourne University Press, 6 Sept. 1973, 8 °, xvi + 368 pp., 138 fig., 81 maps. Clothbound A$ 21. In accordance with the subtitle of this book there are, besides Phanerogams, also small chapters on some Cryptogam families, notably Characeae (algae), Ricciaceae (liverworts), Azollaceae, Isoetaceae, Marsileaceae, Parkeriaceae, Salviniaceae (<b>aquatic</b> <b>ferns).</b> There is a general chapter on the Australian environment. Australia is a dry continent, but many parts are surprisingly well watered with swamps, lagoons, irrigation channels and new reservoirs; depressions are often filled after rains at odd intervals, and many waterplants can survive by rhizomes or seed in intervening dry periods. A total of 220 species are treated. The concept waterplant is, as usual, of an arbitrary nature. The main text is the systematical description of the species, with their distribution. As the author was best acquainted with the Victorian waterplants, locality maps are given of all species occurring in that state. Species descriptions are ample and very many species are depicted, mainly by original drawings...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe <b>aquatic</b> <b>ferns</b> of {{the genus}} Azolla are nitrogen-fixing plants that have great {{potentials}} in agricultural production and environmental conservation. Azolla in many aspects is qualified {{to serve as a}} model organism for genomic studies because of its importance in agriculture, its unique position in plant evolution, its symbiotic relationship with the N 2 -fixing cyanobacterium, Anabaena azollae, and its moderate-sized genome. The goals of this genome project are not only to understand the biology of the Azolla genome to promote its applications in biological research and agriculture practice but also to gain critical insights about evolution of plant genomes. Together with the strategic and technical improvement as well as cost reduction of DNA sequencing, the deciphering of their genetic code is imminent...|$|R

40|$|Exotic macrophytes (particularly <b>aquatic</b> <b>ferns)</b> are {{spreading}} exponentially {{in the last}} decades so they are serious problems to wetland ecosystems since they can replace native species. Azolla filiculoides is an exotic species in Anzali wetland, northern Iran. This book deals with analyzing the habitat suitability of this invasive fern by means of ecological modelling techniques such as classification trees (CTs) combined with two optimizers’ techniques (e. g. genetic algorithms and greedy stepwise) in this unique wetland. The outcomes of models showed that physical-habitat (e. g. air temperature, humidity and depth) and chemical variables (e. g. phosphate) can affect overgrowth of Azolla in wetlands. Application of optimizing techniques in combination with CTs thus proved {{to have a better}} capability in selecting the most important variables explaining the growth of Azolla and can be used by wetland managers in their decision-making for wetland conservation and management programs...|$|R
50|$|It is a {{floating}} <b>aquatic</b> <b>fern,</b> with very fast growth, capable of spreading over lake surfaces to give complete {{coverage of the}} water in only a few months. Each individual plant is 1-2 cm across, green tinged pink, orange or red at the edges, branching freely, and breaking into smaller sections as it grows. It is not tolerant of cold temperatures, and in temperate regions it largely dies back in winter, surviving by means of submerged buds. Like other species of Azolla, it can fix nitrogen from the air.|$|E

It is a free floating plant that does not attach to the soil, but instead remains buoyant on the surface of a body of water. The fronds are 0.5-4 cm long and broad, with a bristly surface caused by the hair-like strands that join at the end to form eggbeater shapes. They are used to provide a waterproof covering. These fronds are produced in pairs also with a third modified root-like frond that hangs in the water.|$|E

Ghoshispora shares with Balmeisporites wall ultrastructural and acrolamellate characters, but lacks protruding reticula in each equatorial radial region and possesses second order sculpturing of muri, striae or rugulae. The fossil record indicates that Balmeisporites originated in the Tethyan region during the Barremian-Aptian and {{for the remainder of}} the Cretaceous was concentrated in mid-high latitudes of both hemispheres.

Neste contexto, objetiva-se estabelecer quais e como as variáveis abióticas analisadas influenciam a cobertura e ocorrência de samambaias aquáticas. O estudo foi desenvolvido no Estado da Paraíba em 20 reservatórios localizados em três hidrográficas e duas sub-bacia. Em cada reservatório trabalhou-se em uma parcela e sete transecções para coleta de dados bióticos e abióticos. Foram realizados GLM e uma CCA para correlacionar as samambaias com as variáveis. Foram encontradas sete espécies de samambaias. Salvinia auriculata Aubl. e Ceratopteris thalictroides (L.) Brongn. estiveram relacionadas a ambientes com elevadas concentrações de nitrato e amônia. Azolla filiculoides esteve relacionada a baixos valores de pH, nitrato, amônia e oxigênio dissolvido e Marsilea sp. com elevados valores de pH.
