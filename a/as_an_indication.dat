5|$|Benson in 2010 {{concluded}} {{from its}} size and common distribution that Megalosaurus was the apex predator of its habitat. He saw the absence of Cetiosaurus on the French Armorican Massif <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that Megalosaurus too did not live on that island and {{was limited to the}} London-Brabant Massif.|$|E
5|$|Early critics, such as Thomas Campbell in 1838, {{saw this}} {{constant}} {{allusion to the}} theatre <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that Prospero was meant to represent Shakespeare; the character's renunciation of magic thus signalling Shakespeare's farewell to the stage. This theory persists among later critics, and remains solidly within the critical canon.|$|E
5|$|Branch's music {{regularly}} expresses {{religious and}} political themes emphasizing American exceptionalism. Her music has been well received among conservative commentators {{and members of the}} Tea Party movement for its political message. The use of Branch's music in the campaigns of Cain and Santorum has been seen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of its appeal among outsider candidates. She has released nine singles and an EP, and is working on her debut album for release in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Competition with {{fishermen}} {{also led}} to killer whales being regarded as pests. In {{the waters of the}} Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the killer whales captured in Puget Sound for aquarium through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine-guns, rockets, and depth charges.|$|E
5|$|Eva Longoria was {{announced}} {{as an executive}} producer on March 26. She had worked previously with Cherry on Desperate Housewives, and was hired to add perspective to the Latina roles. ABC Studios gave Cherry permission to start making senior staffing offers for the show on May 1, which was perceived <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that the show would be picked up.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{the risk}} parity {{approach}} has increased since the late 2000s financial crisis as the risk parity approach fared better than traditionally constructed portfolios, {{as well as many}} hedge funds. Some portfolio managers have expressed skepticism about the practical application of the concept and its effectiveness in all types of market conditions but others point to its performance during the financial crisis of 2007-2008 <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of its potential success.|$|E

5|$|That same year, in {{the general}} {{elections}} held in November, Romero Barceló lost his gubernatorial seat against former governor and opposing party rival Rafael Hernández Colón (PPD). It is widely accepted that Romero Barceló lost the elections because of this case, since his public opinion rating had deteriorated substantially during late 1984 as the investigations progressed, and since his political rivals used his defense of the officers <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of a possible conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|The {{intended}} dive {{profile is}} {{useful as a}} planning tool <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of the risks of decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity for the exposure, and also for estimating the volume of open-circuit breathing gas needed for a planned dive, as these depend in part upon the depth and duration of the dive. A dive profile diagram is conventionally drawn with elapsed time running {{from left to right}} and depth increasing down the page.|$|E
5|$|The killer murders another woman, {{disposing}} {{of the body}} in a post office's dead letter office. Investigating, Black finds a human hair with a message etched into it—"hair today, gone tomorrow"—which he takes <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that the murderer is lashing out at a world that he feels has treated him as insignificant. Horn's mental condition seems to deteriorate, and he begins to take the case personally, leading Black to doubt his ability.|$|E

5|$|A flint dagger was {{discovered}} on the site. This type of artefact {{is rare in}} Greater Manchester; the nearest comparable site is in Saddleworth. Its presence has been taken <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that during the Bronze Age the site was used for funerary practices. Many of the hills near Mellor are surmounted by Bronze Age funerary monuments such as Brown Low, Shaw Cairn, and Werneth Low, supporting the possibility that Mellor was also a funerary site. Also dating from the Bronze Age and found on the site was a rare high-status amber necklace. Amber does not occur naturally in Britain the nearest source is the Baltic. It would have been traded over long distances. The necklace {{was discovered}} {{as part of a}} 4,000‑year‑old burial.|$|E
5|$|Kennan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to perform his job in Belgrade. President Josip Broz Tito and his foreign minister, Koča Popović, began to suspect that Kennedy would adopt an anti-Yugoslav policy during his term. Tito and Popović considered Kennedy's decision to observe Captive Nations Week <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that the United States would assist anticommunist liberation efforts in Yugoslavia. Tito also believed that the CIA and the Pentagon were the true directors of American foreign policy. Kennan attempted to restore Tito's confidence in the American foreign policy establishment but his efforts were compromised by a pair of diplomatic blunders, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the U-2 spy incident.|$|E
5|$|Many Jews observe kashrut partially, by abstaining from pork or shellfish, or by not {{drinking}} milk with a meat dish. Some keep kosher at home but will eat in a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one {{analysis of the}} specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of Kosher consumers were Jewish. A sizable non-Jewish {{segment of the population}} views kosher certification <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of wholesomeness. Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider the kosher-pareve designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives. However, since kosher-pareve foods may contain honey, eggs, or fish, strict vegetarians cannot rely on the certification.|$|E

5|$|Rainivoninahitriniony's {{tenure as}} sole Prime Minister was short lived. His violent tendencies, {{irritability}} and insolence toward Rasoherina, {{in addition to}} lingering popular resentment over Rainivoninahitriniony's role in the violent end to Radama's rule, gradually turned {{the opinion of the}} nobles against him. As Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony attempted to counsel his brother, while simultaneously overseeing diplomatic and military efforts to re-pacify the agitated Sakalava and other peoples, who viewed the coup <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of weakening Merina control. The Prime Minister repaid these efforts by repeatedly castigating high-ranking officers and even threatening Rainilaiarivony with his sword.|$|E
5|$|Smyth was {{commissioned}} {{to write the}} report by Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project. The Smyth Report was the first official account of the development of the atomic bombs and the basic physical processes behind them. It also served <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> as to what information was declassified; anything in the Smyth Report could be discussed openly. For this reason, the Smyth Report focused heavily on information, such as basic nuclear physics, which was either already widely known in the scientific community or easily deducible by a competent scientist, and omitted details about chemistry, metallurgy, and ordnance. This would ultimately give a false impression that the Manhattan Project was all about physics.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{are silent}} {{regarding}} the events following the first Persian campaign but the silence {{in itself is}} an indication of the peace that prevailed and that the Persians stopped being a threat to the Roman East. The evidence for the second campaign is meager; Zosimus is the only one to mention it specifically. A passage in the Sibylline Oracles is interpreted by Hartmann <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of the second invasion. The campaign took place in 266 or 267 and was aimed directly at Ctesiphon; Odaenathus reached the walls of the Persian capital but had to cancel the siege and march north to face the influx of Germanic riders attacking Anatolia.|$|E

5|$|Although Etty painted {{many private}} portraits {{of his friends}} and acquaintances, he {{produced}} very few publicly exhibited portraits, fewer than 30 of which were shown during his lifetime. Portraiture was seen as a vulgar and generally worthless form of painting throughout much of the 19th century, and portrait painters continued to be disparaged as a greedy and unimaginative group who survived by feeding the vanity of the emerging middle class. Other than Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball, critics generally disliked his portraits, preferring his history paintings in spite of reservations over his depictions of nudity. Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball did, however, serve <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that Etty could successfully paint works as commissions for the English elite, boosting his status and leading to further commissions. Etty died in November 1849 and soon fell from fashion; by the late 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Charlotte Williams-Wynn became a noted letter writer and diarist; Mary Williams-Wynn married Member of Parliament James Milnes Gaskell. Both Charlotte and Mary died in April 1869.|$|E
5|$|Hydraulic mining, which Pliny {{referred}} to as ruina montium ("ruin of the mountains"), allowed base and precious metals to be extracted on a proto-industrial scale. The total annual iron output is estimated at 82,500tonnes. Copper was produced {{at an annual rate}} of 15,000t, and lead at 80,000t, both production levels unmatched until the Industrial Revolution; Hispania alone had a 40% share in world lead production. The high lead output was a by-product of extensive silver mining which reached 200t per annum. At its peak around the mid-2nd century AD, the Roman silver stock is estimated at 10,000t, five to ten times larger than the combined silver mass of medieval Europe and the Caliphate around 800AD. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of the scale of Roman metal production, lead pollution in the Greenland ice sheet quadrupled over its prehistoric levels during the Imperial era, and dropped again thereafter.|$|E
5|$|British {{reinforcement}} entered Basque Roads at 15:20, just as {{the crew}} of Calcutta abandoned the ship, withdrawing across the shoal. Forming a line of battle, the British opened a heavy fire on the nearby, and still grounded, Ville de Varsouvie while Beagle, armed with heavy carronades, nosed close inshore and took up station across the bow of Aquilon and raked the French ship repeatedly. For two hours these immobile French ships were battered by the British line with little reply, until at 17:30 both raised Union flags <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that they had surrendered. Shortly afterwards {{the crew of the}} wrecked Tonnere abandoned their ship and set it on fire. The French ship was destroyed by a magazine explosion at 19:30, followed at 20:30 by Calcutta, which had been mistakenly set on fire by an over-enthusiastic British boarding party. The storeship was carrying a large quantity of munitions, reportedly worth over half a million pounds in value, and produced an enormous explosion. Most of the British ships had suffered only minor damage and casualties from fire from the gun batteries on Île-d'Aix, where Revenge had temporarily grounded during the night and suffered 18 casualties. The French losses were minor except on Ville de Varsouvie, which had taken about 100 casualties in the exchange.|$|E
