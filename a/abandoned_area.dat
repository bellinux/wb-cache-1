Garo encounters all the S-Class, or the ranked strongest, heroes, and proceeds to continue his 'monstrification' process during the battles. Finally he encounters Saitama(Who had come annoyed at the noise from the fight), whose attitude and strength infuriates and eventually destroys Garo's will, then reveals his vision for the future. Saitama, out of character, understands his pain, and under the threat by the defeated heroes to kill Garo, Garo leaves before anyone can catch him.|$|E
25|$|The shorter {{defensive}} position {{behind the}} Noyon Salient {{was built to}} economise on manpower, contain an Allied breakthrough and make possible a deliberate withdrawal to prepared positions. By destroying the infrastructure and demolishing civilian buildings in the salient before a withdrawal, the Germans could dislocate Franco-British offensive preparations, by forcing them to advance into a wasteland. The British and French armies would need about eight weeks to rebuild roads, bridges and railways in the <b>abandoned</b> <b>area</b> before they could attack. A shorter Western Front could be held with fewer troops and by incorporating the lessons of defensive battle on the Somme, the importance of troop dispersal, reverse-slope positions, defence in depth and camouflage, German infantry casualties could be reduced. While the German army recuperated from the losses of 1916, protected by the Hindenburg Line and similar defensive positions {{on the rest of}} the Western Front, a return to unrestricted submarine warfare and a strategic bombing offensive against Britain were planned.|$|E
25|$|In the {{escalating}} conflict, Rama is attacked. He defeats the assailants {{only to discover}} a police ID {{on one of the}} attackers. When the families meet to reconcile, Uco lashes out in anger, embarrassing Bangun into an important territory concession. Shaken after maiming other policemen, Rama calls Lt. Bunawar and learns the attackers were Reza's corrupt cops sent after him as part of the war. He then receives a call from Eka to save Uco. Bangun beats Uco harshly on their return to his office. While Yuda is on the way, Bejo and The Assassin barge their way in with a mob of henchmen. Revealing his betrayal, Uco kills his father and shoots Eka in the leg. Before Bejo can finish him off, Yuda arrives and stalls as Eka flees. The Assassin subdues the already-exhausted Rama, and Bejo commands his men to get rid of him. Eka follows, leading to a highway chase and several destroyed vehicles, before rescuing Yuda and driving to safety in an <b>abandoned</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to map, classify and evaluate <b>abandoned</b> <b>areas</b> which are in the southern part of Černokostelecko. It begins with an examination of theories relating to abandoned land and landscape change. The study of abandoned land is rarely included in scientific studies. In the next part, applied part, were mapped coverage of wood species, former use, dominant plants and lenght of abandonment. The <b>abandoned</b> <b>areas</b> were classified and distributed according to their character. It was focused on floodplains of Jevanský and Vlkančický stream. It was found out that high proportion of <b>abandoned</b> <b>areas</b> are situated in floodplains. Most of these areas were formerly in use as pastures or meadows. The lenght of abandonment differs, but the majority date from after 1990, co-inciding with the instance of great economic and political change. <b>Abandoned</b> <b>areas</b> in floodplains has relatively low coverage of the wood species, whereas in areas outside floodplains, coverage of the wood species is considerably higher and it is probable that areas areas outside of floodplains will in future, be covered by forest.

Sternfeld's work was regularly discussed and exhibited during the 2000s as the rehabilitation project moved forward. In a similar vein, Alan Weisman's 2007 book The World Without Us discussed the High Line {{as an example of the}} reappearance of the wild in an <b>abandoned</b> <b>area.</b> That same year chase scenes from the zombie apocalypse film I Am Legend were filmed there and in the Meatpacking District.

40|$|The study {{focuses on}} {{environmental}} impacts of <b>abandoned</b> urban <b>areas</b> and provides {{a solution to this}} problem through scientific methods. Many cities often suffer from lack of sustainable regulations and a successful approach to the urban development. In order to have a successful approach, urban regeneration might prove to be a valid solution for <b>abandoned</b> <b>areas.</b> However, cities still do not have a definite or proper solution for <b>abandoned</b> <b>areas.</b> Therefore, this study conducts a quantitative (Grid Based Model-Hierarchical Cluster Analysis) and qualitative (Strength-Weakness-Opportunity-Threat [SWOT]) analysis with a specific focus on potential solutions for Brownfield areas. The detailed study has placed emphasis on appropriate development for the cities. This practice of urban development has defined healthy and sustainable approaches to the cities. Various analysis techniques included within the newly developed model for <b>abandoned</b> urban <b>areas</b> should provide a more clear-cut sustainable development through new mechanisms. The method employed in the study could bring a new approach to the urban design application. This study includes comprehensive ecological, economic and social analyses through the method proposed as a solution for <b>abandoned</b> industrial <b>areas.</b> This approach extends as far as urban regeneration projects through spatial analyses. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore and provide an approach to solutions for Brownfield areas. The embracing quantitative and qualitative methods contribute to a growing knowledge on the approaches to solutions for Brownfield areas. This scientific approach can lead to a detailed analysis of the issue. This study makes an attempt to incorporate appropriate and sustainable urbanization into urban regeneration experiences in cities. The methods employed in the study could emphasize the right kind of approach to and right implication for regaining urban derelict areas in a theoretical background. Consequently, the study could emphasize an economic, social and ecological approach to <b>abandoned</b> <b>areas</b> in city development. Especially, urban <b>abandoned</b> <b>areas</b> need a new urban development approach, which, in turn, could yield a possible solution in urban regeneration project. In this study, quantitative and qualitative data analyses tailor on urban structure through scientific methods. And finally, to help establish a design decision model on Brownfield areas, this study puts emphasis on the approaches to solutions based on green areas standards in Turkey...|$|R
