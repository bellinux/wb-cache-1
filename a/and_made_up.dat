5|$|As the NK 9th Division {{approached}} Yongsan, its 1st Regiment was on {{the north}} and its 2nd Regiment on the south. The division's attached support, consisting of one 76mm artillery battalion from the NK I Corps, an antiaircraft battalion of artillery, two tank battalions of the NK 16th Armored Brigade, and a battalion of artillery from the NK 4th Division, gave it unusually heavy support. Crossing the river behind it came the 4th Division, a greatly weakened organization, far understrength, short of weapons, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> mostly of untrained replacements. A captured North Korean document referred to this grouping of units that attacked from the Sinban-ni area into the Naktong Bulge as the main force of NK I Corps. Elements of the 9th Division reached the hills just west of Yongsan during the afternoon of September 1.|$|E
5|$|Connective tissues are fibrous <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> {{of cells}} {{scattered}} among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant {{of which is}} collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, {{as well as in}} many of those less developed.|$|E

5|$|Finally, General Conway {{proposed}} {{what was}} a workable compromise in his opinion: the Fallujah Brigade. Led by former Iraqi Sunni Ba'athists, such as Jasim Mohammed Saleh and Muhammed Latif, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> largely of insurgents who had been fighting the Marines, the brigade was supposed to maintain order in the city while allowing the US to withdraw and save face. On 10 May, General Mattis formally turned the city over and withdrew the following day. The First Battle for Fallujah had resulted in 51 US servicemen killed and 476 wounded. Iraqi losses were much higher. The Marines estimated that about 800 Iraqis were killed. Reports differed on how many were civilians: the Marines counted 300, whereas the independent organization Iraq Body Count argued that 600 civilians had been killed.|$|E
5|$|Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler ("Life Guards SS Adolf Hitler"; LSSAH) was {{an elite}} SS {{protection}} unit founded in 1933 as a palace guard to provide protection for Hitler's residences and offices. The LSSAH {{had some of}} the strictest entry requirements. The commander, Sepp Dietrich insisted that the men be in good physical condition, between the ages of 23 to 35, and have a confirmed ancestry record without Jewish lineage. The LSSAH eventually grew into an elite division of the Waffen-SS. Although nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration. By 1945, while the LSSAH fought on the Eastern Front during World War II, a core group of 800 men stayed in Berlin <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> the Leibstandarte Guard Battalion (Wache Reichskanzlei), assigned to guard the Führer.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} Final Fantasy Adventure was {{composed}} by Kenji Ito, while Hiroki Kikuta composed Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 and Yoko Shimomura wrote the score to Legend of Mana.

5|$|The {{surface of}} Callisto {{is the oldest}} and most heavily cratered in the Solar System. Its surface is {{completely}} covered with impact craters. It does not show any signatures of subsurface processes such as plate tectonics or volcanism, with no signs that geological activity in general has ever occurred, and is thought to have evolved predominantly under the influence of impacts. Prominent surface features include multi-ring structures, variously shaped impact craters, and chains of craters (catenae) and associated scarps, ridges and deposits. At a small scale, the surface is varied <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of small, sparkly frost deposits at the tips of high spots, surrounded by a low-lying, smooth blanket of dark material. This is thought to result from the sublimation-driven degradation of small landforms, which is supported by the general deficit of small impact craters and the presence of numerous small knobs, considered to be their remnants. The absolute ages of the landforms are not known.|$|E
5|$|The tail of Sauropelta was {{characteristically}} long <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> {{nearly half}} of the body length. One skeleton preserved forty caudal (tail) vertebrae, although some were missing, suggesting that the true number of caudal vertebrae may have exceeded fifty. Ossified tendons stiffened the tail along its length. Like other ankylosaurs, Sauropelta had a wide body, with a very broad pelvis and ribcage. The forelimbs were shorter than the hindlimbs, which resulted in an arched back, with the highest point over the hips. Its feet, limbs, shoulders, and pelvis were all very stoutly constructed and reinforced to support a great deal of weight. American paleontologist Ken Carpenter estimated the mass of S. edwardsorum at 1,500kilograms (3,300lb).|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1940 and 1941 the {{battalion}} undertook {{a number of}} training camps in Victoria. In December 1941, with Japan's entry into the war following the attacks on Malaya and Pearl Harbor, {{the battalion}} was mobilised for war service and tasked with defending the Dandenong area. In 1942, however, it received orders to move north to Darwin, where it carried out garrison duties to defend the town and experienced a number air raids from Japanese aircraft.

5|$|Following the {{successful}} realisation of the Doctor's home planet of Gallifrey on screen in The Deadly Assassin, producer Graham Williams wanted another Gallifrey story. Script editor Anthony Read approached David Weir {{with whom he}} had worked before. Weir's script, a six-part story, was planned as the final story of Season 15 and was commissioned on 18 July 1977. Weir's script had elements drawn from Asian cultures, and included a race of cat-people with links to Gallifrey. Scenes included a gladiatorial duel in a stadium filled with cat-people. Read and director Gerald Blake, upon reading the finished script, determined that the story would be impossible to shoot on Doctor Whos budget and the story was abandoned mid-August 1977. With only two weeks to spare before filming, Read and Williams quickly co-wrote a replacement script in the form of The Invasion of Time. When asked about Weir's story at a fan convention years later, Williams could not recall its title <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> the name The Killer Cats of Geng Singh, by which title the story became widely known in fan circles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} season, Wales {{completed}} their first full Home Nations Championship; Gould played as the lone centre {{in all three}} games. It was a fairly successful Championship for the Welsh, with a draw, a win and a loss, leaving them second in the table. Of note during the series was Bob Gould's captaincy in the second match, against Scotland, and Gould's first ever international dropped goal – which gave Wales a win over Ireland <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> for him missing a dropped goal by just a yard in their draw against England. Due to work commitments, Gould only played {{one of the two}} Wales games of the 1888 Home Nations Championship, in the country's first victory over Scotland, thanks to a single try from Thomas Pryce-Jenkins. In the second game, played away to Ireland, George Bowen was given the centre position in the last match Wales would play with a three threequarter system. Gould then missed the first Welsh international against an overseas touring side, when the New Zealand Natives were beaten at St. Helen's in Swansea, and was still absent two months later for the opening game of the 1889 Championship. Gould returned in time for the clash with Ireland where he was given the captaincy and played alongside Llanelli centre Tom Morgan. Gould lost his first match as captain, losing by two tries to nil at home – this was the first of 18 caps he earned leading his country.|$|E

5|$|Two of Masamune's ten {{excellent}} students (juttetsu), Norishige and Gō Yoshihiro, {{lived in}} Etchū Province {{at the end}} of the Kamakura period. While none of Gō Yoshihiro's works is signed, there are extant signed tantō and tachi by Norishigi. One tantō by Norishige and two katana by Gō Yoshihiro have been designated as national treasures. Generally Norishige's sugata is characteristic of the time: tantō are with not-rounded fukura and uchi-zori, thick kasane and steep slopes of iori-mune. The jihada is matsukawa-hada with thick ji-nie, lots of chikei along the o-hada. The jigane is not equal to that of Masamune or Gō Yoshihiro. Norishige hamon is relatively wide <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of bright and larger nie based in notare mixed with suguha chōji midare or with gunome midare. Gō Yoshihiro produced various sugata with either small kissaki and narrow mihaba or with wider mihaba and larger kissaki. His jihada is identical to that of the Awataguchi school in Yamashiro Province: soft jigane, small mokume-hada mixed with wavy ō-hada. Thick ji-nie becomes yubashiri with chikei.
