40|$|Network {{calculus}} is {{an elegant}} theory which uses envelopes {{to determine the}} worst-case performance bounds in a network. Statistical network calculus is the probabilistic version of network calculus, which strives to retain the simplicity of envelope approach from network calculus and use the arguments of statistical multiplexing to determine probabilistic performance bounds in a network. The tightness of the determined probabilistic bounds depends on the efficiency of modelling stochastic properties of the <b>arrival</b> <b>traffic</b> and the service available to the traffic at a network node. The notion of effective bandwidth from large deviations theory is a well known statistical descriptor of <b>arrival</b> <b>traffic.</b> Similarly, the notion of effective capacity summarizes the time varying resource availability to the <b>arrival</b> <b>traffic</b> at a network node.

40|$|Substantial {{increases}} in the volume of air traffic in the National Airspace System (NAS) are forecast for the next decade, {{with the number of}} passengers travelling on U. S. airlines expected to increase by as much as 60 %. This increased demand on system capacity will be accompanied by {{increases in}} traffic complexity as air traffic service providers routinely accommodate user preferred routing requests. Changes to the NAS to meet these new demands are currently underway, including development of new decision support tools to aid controllers in monitoring and managing air traffic, and increased air-to-air and air-to-ground information exchange. Changes in roles and responsibilities of pilots and controllers in flight path management will accompany these changes in traffic patterns and information technology, however the ultimate responsibility for maintaining aircraft separation will remain with the air traffic controller. A thorough understanding of the methods controllers use to manage air traffic will help ensure that changes to the NAS are implemented in a way that maintains the controller's ability to separate aircraft as the system evolves. This presentation describes the strategies controllers use today to manage <b>arrival</b> <b>traffic</b> in its descent from cruise altitude to the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) boundary. Factors that increase the complexity of this task include the presence of overflight traffic, varying aircraft performance characteristics, winds aloft, ground speed variations with altitude, the need to merge <b>arrival</b> <b>traffic</b> into a single stream, and, when <b>arrival</b> <b>traffic</b> exceeds airport runway capacity, the added task of metering flow into the TRACON. Because of the limited information available to controllers to manage <b>arrival</b> <b>traffic,</b> their strategies are often driven by the need to reduce the task's complexity, which can result in de-optimized flight paths for individual aircraft (e. g., sub-optimal descent or speed profiles). Understanding these strategies and the cognitive demands that drive them will support a safe transition to a NAS that relies on enhanced technologies. In addition, it could enable system developers to identify opportunities for new automation-based procedures or information displays that could reduce the controller's workload and increase operational efficiency...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHow to {{estimate}} queue length in real-time at signalized intersection is a long-standing problem. The traditional input–output approach for queue length estimation can only handle queues that are {{shorter than the}} distance between vehicle detector and intersection stop line, because cumulative vehicle count for <b>arrival</b> <b>trafﬁc</b> is not available once the detector is occupied by the queue. Based on the analysis of traffic flow's shockwave profile on the approach of signalized intersections, the paper brings forward a model to detect the real-time queue length based on RFID detector data. The model solves the problem of measuring intersection queue length by exploiting the queue delay of individual vehicles instead of counting <b>arrival</b> <b>trafﬁc</b> ﬂow in the signal cycle. Variations of the estimation model are also presented under different traffic volumes, the relationship between queue length and {{the capacity of the}} approach is also under consideration.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} NASA's Integrated Demand Management (IDM) {{concept and}} {{presents the results}} from an early proof-of-concept evaluation and an exploratory experiment. An initial development of the concept was focused on integrating two systems - i. e. the FAA's newly deployed Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS) tool called the Collaborative Trajectory Options Program (CTOP) and the Time-Based Flow Management (TBFM) system with Extended Metering (XM) capabilities to manage projected heavy traffic demand into a capacity-constrained airport. A human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation experiment was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the initial development of the concept by adapting it to an <b>arrival</b> <b>traffic</b> problem at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) during clear weather conditions. In this study, the CTOP was utilized to strategically plan the <b>arrival</b> <b>traffic</b> demand by controlling take-off times of both short- and long-haul flights (long-hauls specify aircraft outside TBFM regions and short-hauls specify aircraft within TBFM regions) {{in a way that}} results in equitable delays among the groups. Such strategic planning allows less airborne delay to occur within TBFM by feeding manageable long-haul traffic demand while reserving sufficient slots in the overhead streams for the short-haul departures. The manageable traffic demand indicates the TBFM scheduler assigns no more airborne delay than its assigned airspace is capable of absorbing. TBFM then uses its time-based metering capabilities to deliver the desirable throughput by tactically rescheduling the TBFM entered long-haul flights and short-haul departures. Additional research was also performed to explore use of Required Time of Arrival (RTA) capabilities as a potential control mechanism for the airborne flights to improve <b>arrival</b> <b>traffic</b> delivery accuracy of scheduled long-haul traffic demand. The study results show that both short- and long-haul flights received similar ground delays. In addition, there was a noticeable reduction in the total amount of excessive unanticipated last-minute ground delays, i. e. delays that are frequently imposed on the short-haul flight in current day operations due to saturation in the overhead stream, commonly referred to as 'double penalty'. Furthermore, the concept achieved the target throughput while minimizing the expected cost associated with overall delays in <b>arrival</b> <b>traffic.</b> Assessment of the RTA capabilities showed that there was indeed improvement of the scheduled entry times into TBFM regions by using RTA capabilities. However, with respect to reduction in delays incurred within TBFM, there was no observable benefit of improving the precision of long-haul flights entry times...|$|R
