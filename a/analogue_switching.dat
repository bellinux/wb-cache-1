40|$|Since its {{inception}} the memristive fuse {{has been a}} good example of how small numbers of memristors can be combined to obtain useful behaviours unachievable by individual devices. In this work, we link the memristive fuse concept with that of the Complementary Resistive Switch (CRS), exploit that link to experimentally demonstrate a practical memristive fuse using TiOx-based ReRAM cells and explain its basic operational principles. The fuse is stimulated by trains of identical pulses where successive pulse trains feature opposite polarities. In response, we observe a gradual (analogue) drop in resistive state followed by a gradual recovery phase regardless of input stimulus polarity; echoing traditional, binary CRS behaviour. This <b>analogue</b> <b>switching</b> property opens the possibility of operating the memristive fuse as a single-component step change detector. Moreover, we discover that the characteristics of the individual memristors used to demonstrate the memristive fuse concept in this work allow our fuse to be operated in a regime where one of the two constituent devices can be switched largely independently from the other. This property, not present in the traditional CRS, indicates that the inherently analogue memristive fuse architecture may support additional operational flexibility through e. g. allowing finer control over its resistive state.

40|$|Self-assembled {{periodic}} structures {{based upon}} chiralliquid crystalline materials have significant {{potential in the}} field of photonics ranging from fast-switching optoelectronic devices to low-threshold lasers. The flexoelectro-optic effect, which is observed in chiralnematic liquid crystals (LCs) when an electric field is applied perpendicular to the helical axis, has significant potential as it exhibits <b>analogue</b> <b>switching</b> in 10 – 100 [*]μs. However, the major technological barrier that prohibits the commercial realisation of this electro-opticeffect is the requirement of a uniform, in-plane alignment of the helix axis between glass substrates. Here, it is shown that periodic polymer structures engineered in the nematic phase of a chiral nematic LC device using direct laser writing can result in the spontaneous formation of the necessary uniform lying helix (ULH) state. Specifically, two-photon polymerization is used in conjunction with a spatial light modulator so as to correct for aberrations introduced by the bounding glass substrates enabling the polymer structures to be fabricated directly into the device. The ULH state appears to be stable {{in the absence of an}} externally applied electric field, and the optimum contrast between the bright and dark states is obtained using polymer structures that have periodicities of the order of the device thickness...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the efficacy of switching therapy with a second-line luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue after prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression for advanced prostate cancer. We enrolled 200 patients, from December 2005 to September 2013, with nodal positive, metastatic prostate cancer or disease progression after definite treatment receiving continuous LHRH analogue therapy with monthly depot leuprorelin(sc) acetate 3. 75  mg/vial (LA) or goserelin acetate(sc) 3. 6  mg/vial (GA). If the patients had castration-resistant prostate cancer, the treatment choice of switching therapy (from LA to GA or from GA to LA) prior to starting chemotherapy was given. The LH, testosterone level, and PSA change were recorded. The records showed that there were 127 patients receiving LA as initial ADT therapy, whereas the other 73 patients were in GA therapy. A total of 92 patients received LHRH <b>analogue</b> <b>switching</b> therapy (54 patients switched from LA to GA and 38 switched from GA to LA). The effect of LH and testosterone reduction prior to and after switching therapy was comparable between the two groups, and increased PSA level after 3  months of treatment was seen in both groups (median PSA: 15. 7 – 67. 7  ng/mL in the LA to GA group; 15. 2 – 71. 4  ng/mL in the GA to LA group).

40|$|In {{acoustic}} imaging {{there is a}} tradeoff between resolution and depth of focus. Obtaining high resolution requires strong focussing which results in a small focal depth. To achieve good depth of focus requires weaker focussing, with a corresponding loss of resolution. In pulse echo systems, this may be alleviated {{to a certain extent}} by transmitting a weakly focussed pulse which remains in focus over the complete depth of interest, and using stronger focussing while receiving the echoes. The narrow depth of focus on reception requires that the focus be scanned dynamically as the echoes are received. Such a focussing scheme may be implemented by using a series of concentric circular apertures or rings. The signals sent to and received from each aperture are delayed to compensate for the different path lengths from the aperture to the focus point. Previous implementations of dynamic focussing have used tapped analogue delay lines to vary the delays as signals are received. The delays may also be implemented digitally using A/D convertors and digital shift registers. The main advantage of the digital implementation are a reduced susceptibility to noise, especially noise resulting from <b>analogue</b> <b>switching.</b> A disadvantage is the high sample rate required to satisfy the Nyquist criterion and to maintain accurate delays. It is shown that by processing the amplitude and phase of the received signals separately, the sample rate may be reduced considerably with minimal loss in system resolution...|$|E

40|$|Resistive {{random access}} memory (RRAM) is widely {{considered}} as a disruptive technology that will revolutionize not only non-volatile data storage, but also potentially digital logic and neuromorphic computing. The resistive switching mechanism is generally conceived as the rupture/restoration of defect-formed conductive filament (CF) or defect profile modulation, for filamentary and non-filamentary devices respectively. However, details of the underlying microscopic behaviour of the resistive switching in RRAM are still largely missing. In this thesis, a defect probing technique based on the random telegraph noise (RTN) is developed for both filamentary and non-filamentary devices, which can reveal the resistive switching mechanism at defect level and {{can also be used}} to analyse the device performance issues. HfO 2 is one of the most matured metal-oxide materials in semiconductor industry and HfO 2 RRAM shows promising potential in practical application. An RTN-based defect extraction technique is developed for the HfO 2 devices to detect individual defect movement and provide statistical information of CF modification during normal operations. A critical filament region (CFR) is observed and further verified by defect movement tracking. Both defect movements and CFR modification are correlated with operation conditions, endurance failure and recovery. Non-filamentary devices have areal switching characteristics, and are promising in overcoming the drawbacks of filamentary devices that mainly come from the stochastic nature of the CF. a-VMCO is an outstanding non-filamentary device with a set of unique characteristics, but its resistive switching mechanism has not been clearly understood yet. By utilizing the RTN-based defect profiling technique, defect profile modulation in the switching layer is identified and correlated with digital and <b>analogue</b> <b>switching</b> behaviours, for the first time. State instability is analysed and a stable resistance window of 10 for > 106 cycles is restored through combining optimizations of device structure and operation conditions, paving the way for its practical application. TaOx-based RRAM has shown fast switching in the sub-nanosecond regime, good CMOS compatibility and record endurance of more than 1012 cycles. Several inconsistent models have been proposed for the Ta 2 O 5 /TaOx bilayered structure, and it is difficult to quantify and optimize the performance, largely due to the lack of microscopic description of resistive switching based on experimental results. An indepth analysis of the TiN/Ta 2 O 5 /TaOx/TiN structured RRAM is carried out with the RTN-based defect probing technique, for both bipolar and unipolar switching modes. Significant differences in defect profile have been observed and explanations have been provided...|$|E

For analyzing factors affecting IOP reduction, baseline IOP and preceding PGA were selected as statistically and clinically significant factors. In this report, we examine IOP-lowering effect and adverse drug reactions by preceding PGA. Methods: Patients with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who received monotherapy with one of four PGAs (travoprost, latanoprost, tafluprost, or bimatoprost) for at least 3 months at 26 institutions and were determined to require additional medication by their primary physician were included. IOP reduction and adverse events were examined at 4, 8, and 12 weeks for each of four PGAs after switching to TTFC. Results: In total, 157 patients who could be followed up for at least 4 weeks after switching to TTFC {{were included in the}} efficacy analysis. Multiple regression analysis was performed, and baseline IOP and PGA were found to be significant factors to IOP reduction. IOP reduction at week 12, adjusted with the regression model, was - 3. 5, - 1. 8, and - 1. 4 mmHg in the tafluprost, latanoprost, and travoprost groups, whereas it was - 0. 5 mmHg in the bimatoprost group. Along with differences in baseline IOP between groups, an IOP-lowering effect of > 1 mmHg was noted in the tafluprost, latanoprost, and travoprost groups after the switch. IOP was maintained at 13. 8 – 14. 8 mmHg throughout the follow-up period. No serious adverse events or noteworthy issues were observed in any group after the switch. Conclusion: Clinically significant IOP-reducing effects of TTFC were observed in the latanoprost, travoprost, and tafluprost groups when switching from each PGA monotherapy, while there were some differences in effects between groups, with minimal safety concerns.

From all optimization algorithms applicable for this kind of optimization, two ones that seem to be the most promising are proposed. The differential evolution (one of evolutionary algorithms) combined with the simplex method was found to be most appropriate from these two ones. Two types of programs are required for the optimization of these circuits: a program for implementing calculations of the used optimization algorithm and a program for the analysis of the optimized circuit. Several suitable computer programs from both of the groups together with their proper settings according to authors’ experience are proposed.
