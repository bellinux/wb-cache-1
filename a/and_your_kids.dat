40|$|What is livability? The {{title of}} this handout could {{alternately}} read “What is your own [family’s, community’s, region’s, agency’s, employer’s, industry’s] definition of livability? ” Why? Because {{there is not one}} definitive description of what livability is and what it is not. Perspectives on livability vary by geography, such as from resident to resident, community to community, and region to region. In addition, what is considered livable varies based on industry and responsibility, such as from agency to agency or industry to industry. Having many definitions for livability is not necessarily a problem. The challenge is to find a definition of livability suited to the context. For example, a community discussing local transportation issues will use a different, more specific definition of livability than a federal agency looking at transportation issues and needs for the future. The following are descriptions of livability from several national agencies or organizations: “Livability means being able to take <b>your</b> <b>kids</b> to school, go to work, see a doctor, drop by the grocery or post office, go out to dinner and a movie, <b>and</b> play with <b>your</b> <b>kids</b> in a park, all without having to get in your car. ...|$|R
