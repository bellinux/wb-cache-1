5|$|The demands made by {{the colonial}} {{government}} on Congolese workers during the war provoked strikes and riots from the workforce. Whites in the colony were allowed to form trade unions {{for the first time}} during the war, and their demands for better pay and working conditions were often emulated by black workers. In October 1941, white workers in the colony unsuccessfully attempted <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>strike</b> across the colony.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} crisis surrounding Leopold III's role during the occupation, {{and whether he}} could return to the throne, polarized Belgian public opinion {{in the years following}} the war between Catholics, notably in Flanders, who broadly supported his return, and Socialists, in Wallonia and Brussels, who were strongly opposed to it. After <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>strike</b> and an indecisive referendum, the king resigned in favour of his son, Baudouin, in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Batista {{had come}} under {{increasing}} pressure by 1958. His army's military failures, coupled with his press censorship {{and the police}} and army's use of torture and extrajudicial executions, were increasingly criticized both domestically and abroad. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased supplying him with weaponry, leading him to buy arms from the United Kingdom. The opposition used this opportunity to call <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>strike,</b> accompanied by armed attacks from the MR-26-7. Beginning on 9 April, it received strong support {{in central and eastern}} Cuba, but little elsewhere.|$|E

By 1958, Batista was under increasing pressure, a result of his military failures coupled with increasing domestic and foreign criticism surrounding his administration's press censorship, torture, and extrajudicial executions. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased supplying him with weaponry. The opposition called <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>strike,</b> accompanied by armed attacks from the MR-26-7. Beginning on April 9, it received strong support in central and eastern Cuba, but little elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Following the incident, the {{government}} offered dialogue which the opposition {{said they will}} only take part in after {{the withdrawal of the}} army. The general labor union called for <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>strike.</b> Internationally, the attack on protesters was condemned by Barack Obama and Human Rights Watch. High Representative of European Union expressed her deep concerns and called for restrain and immediate dialogue. Britain revoked over forty arms licenses to Bahrain after an earlier announcement that it would review them and German president canceled a planned visit to the country. Buhmaid is remembered by the opposition as a martyr, leader and symbol of peacefulness.|$|E
5|$|In January 1936, Syrian {{nationalist}} sentiments became incensed as the French authorities suspended {{parliament and}} appointed the pro-French president Taj al-Din al-Hasani. Following {{the arrest of}} some nationalist leaders, <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>strike</b> was declared against the French Mandate and President al-Hasani. Speeches denouncing the arrests and colonialism were made at the Umayyad Mosque, after which demonstrators, including students and local youths, gathered at al-Bakri's home where they coordinated a march to the Serail (French government headquarters). The protests were led by al-Bakri, al-Quwatli and Jamil Mardam Bey, but they were confronted by the security forces before leaving al-Bakri's street.|$|E

The Provisional IRA were suspected by British police of bombing two pubs in the English city of Birmingham the following November, resulting in 21 deaths.|$|E
5|$|Morales' {{second term}} was heavily {{affected}} by infighting and dissent from {{within his own}} support base, as indigenous and leftist activists came to oppose {{a number of the}} governments' reforms. In May 2010, Morales' government announced a 5% rise in the minimum wage. The Bolivian Workers' Central (COB) felt this insufficient given the rise in the cost of living, and called <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>strike.</b> Protesters clashed with police, although the government refused to increase the rise, accusing protesters of being pawns of the right. In August 2010, violent protests then broke out in southern Potosí over widespread unemployment and a lack of investment in infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|Offitt's {{membership}} has tired of endless talk, and plans <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>strike,</b> {{a fact of}} which Farnham is informed by Mr. Temple, a salty-talking vice president of a rolling mill. An element among the strikers also plans to loot houses along Algonquin Avenue, including Farnham's. The strike begins, paralyzing Buffland's commerce, though it is initially nonviolent. Neither the mayor nor the chief of police, when approached by Farnham, are willing to guard Algonquin Avenue. Farnham proceeds to organize Civil War veterans, and purchases weapons to arm them. After Farnham's force rescues the mayor from being attacked, he deputizes them as special police—on condition there is no expense to the city.|$|E

Political leaders such as Shamsul Huq, Shawkat Ali, Kazi Golam Mahboob, Oli Ahad, Abdul Wahed and others were arrested during the rallies. Rally leader Mohammad Toaha was hospitalised after attempting to snatch a rifle from a police officer. Student leaders, including Abdul Matin and Abdul Malek Ukil {{took part in the}} procession.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} struggle for democracy was solved outside Finland, via international power politics; the Russian Empire's failed 1904–1905 war against Japan {{led to the}} 1905 Revolution in Russia and to <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>strike</b> in Finland. In an attempt to quell the general unrest, the system of estates was abolished in the Parliamentary Reform of 1906, which introduced universal suffrage. The general strike increased support for the Social Democrats substantially, {{as a proportion of}} the population, the party was the most powerful socialist movement in the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} that the general strike could be used, but {{only as a last}} resort, became dominant in the party during the mass strike debate. This caused much concern among the conservatives in the party, especially among many trade unionists. At a meeting in February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, who said they would attempt to prevent <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>strike</b> at all costs. The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from the meeting in Die Einigkeit, greatly angering the party leadership.|$|E
5|$|After her defeat, Bondfield resumed {{her work}} for NUGMW and was re-elected to the TUC Council. In 1926 she {{supported}} the TUC's decision to hold <b>a</b> <b>General</b> <b>Strike,</b> {{and also the}} decision to call it off after nine days. Following the resignation of Sir Patrick Hastings in June 1926, Bondfield was adopted as the Labour candidate at Wallsend, and won the subsequent by-election with a majority of over 9,000. Meanwhile, she had accepted appointment to the Blanesburgh Committee, which the Conservative government had set up to consider reforms to the system of unemployment benefit. Her private view, that entitlement to benefits should be related to contributions, was not widely shared in the Labour Party or the TUC. When the committee made recommendations along these lines she signed the report, which became {{the basis of the}} Unemployment Insurance Act 1927. Bondfield's association with this legislation permanently shadowed her relationship with the Labour movement.|$|E
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} months the communists tried {{repeatedly}} to seize power in Stuttgart {{and other cities}} in Württemberg through armed rebellion, accompanied by large-scale strikes. They seized public buildings and print offices. During one such an attempt - {{at the beginning of}} April 1919 when the Bavarian Soviet Republic was formally proclaimed in Munich - <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>strike</b> took place in the Stuttgart area. The government in Stuttgart imposed a state of emergency and 16 people died in street fights.
