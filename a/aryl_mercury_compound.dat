40|$|Mercury is a toxic and non-essential {{metal in}} the human body. Mercury is ubiquitously {{distributed}} in the environment, present in nat-ural products, and exists extensively in items encountered in daily life. There are three forms of mercury, i. e., elemental (or metallic) <b>mercury,</b> inorganic <b>mercury</b> <b>compounds,</b> and organic <b>mercury</b> <b>compounds.</b> This review examines the toxicity of elemental mercury and inorganic <b>mercury</b> <b>compounds.</b> Inorganic <b>mercury</b> <b>compounds</b> are water soluble with a bioavailability of 7 % to 15 % after inges-tion; they are also irritants and cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Upon entering the body, inorganic <b>mercury</b> <b>compounds</b> are accumu-lated mainly in the kidneys and produce kidney damage. In contrast, human exposure to elemental mercury is mainly by inhalation, followed by rapid absorption and distribution in all major organs. Elemental mercury from ingestion is poorly absorbed with a bio-availability of less than 0. 01 %. The primary target organs of elemental mercury are the brain and kidney. Elemental mercury is lipid sol-uble and can cross the blood-brain barrier, while inorganic <b>mercury</b> <b>compounds</b> are not lipid soluble, rendering them unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. Elemental mercury may also enter the brain from the nasal cavity through the olfactory pathway. The blood mercury is a useful biomarker after short-term and high-level exposure, whereas the urine mercury is the ideal biomarker for long-term exposure to both elemental and inorganic mercury, and also as a good indicator of body burden.

We hypothesized that an induction of apoptosis by <b>mercury</b> <b>compounds</b> {{could be an}} activating signal of the microglial reaction. Aggregating brain cell cultures of fetal rat telencephalon were treated for 10 days with either mercury chloride or monomethylmercury chloride at noncytotoxic concentrations during two developmental periods: from day 5 to 15, corresponding to an immature stage, and from day 25 to 35 corresponding to a mature stage. Apoptosis was evaluated by the TUNEL technique. It was found that both <b>mercury</b> <b>compounds</b> caused {{a significant increase in}} the number of apoptotic cells, but exclusively in immature cultures exhibiting also spontaneous apoptosis. Double staining by the TUNEL technique combined with either neuronal or astroglial markers revealed that the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis was highest for astrocytes. Furthermore neither an association nor a colocalization was found between apoptotic cells and microglial cells. In conclusion, it appears that the induction of apoptosis by <b>mercury</b> <b>compounds</b> in immature cells is only an acceleration of a spontaneously occurring process, and that it is not a directly related to the early microglial reaction...|$|R
40|$|The mercury {{occurs in}} the {{environment}} {{in a variety of}} forms. <b>Mercury</b> <b>compounds</b> {{can be found in the}} soil, atmosphere, water and living organisms. Although some of the mercury substances are very toxic, they are often used in various sectors of industry, agriculture and medicine. <b>Mercury</b> <b>compounds</b> differ in their toxicity, so it is necessary to do speciation analysis. The aim of this diploma thesis was to develop and validate a new analytical method for the determination of <b>mercury</b> <b>compounds</b> in different samples. This method involves the combination of high performance liquid chromatography, UV-photochemical cold vapor mercury generation and atomic absorption spectrometry. Effective separation of mercury(II), methylmercury(I), ethylmercury(I) and phenylmercury(I) ions and subsequent comparable efficient of mercury cold vapor generation from all of forms was achieved using these techniques. The reached detection limits were 8 µg l- 1, 31 µg l- 1, 16 µg l- 1 and 38 µg l- 1.
