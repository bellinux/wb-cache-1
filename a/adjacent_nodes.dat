50|$|When a node x {{accepts a}} joining node y as its child and detects that the tree balance is violated, it initiates the {{restructuring}} process. Without loss of generality, suppose that this restructuring is towards the right. Assume that y joins as x's left child. To rebalance thesystem, x notifies y to replace its position, and notifies its right <b>adjacent</b> <b>node</b> z that x will replace z's position. z then checks its right <b>adjacent</b> <b>node</b> t {{to see if}} its left child is empty. If it is, and adding a child to t {{does not affect the}} tree balance, z takes the position of t's left child as its new position and the restructuring process stops. If t's left child is full or t cannot accept x as its left child without violating the balance property, z occupies t's position while t needs to find a new position for itself by continuing to its right <b>adjacent</b> <b>node.</b>|$|R

The computer is presented to the player as twelve separate processing nodes laid out in a four-by-three grid. Each node has a single processor register to store a numerical value as well as a backup register. Nodes also hold their own assembly language program as entered by the user. The assembly language, a simplified version of real-world assembly languages, allows the node to accept external input or a numerical value sent from an <b>adjacent</b> <b>node,</b> perform basic math and logic operations, store and backup the current data value, and then send results to an <b>adjacent</b> <b>node</b> or to the program's output.

30|$|In view of {{the above}} problems, a {{strategy}} of non-uniform optimization deployment is proposed, and the policy is described as follows: there is a uniform deployment between two <b>adjacent</b> sensing <b>nodes</b> or the sink node and the sensing node, that is the distance between two <b>adjacent</b> relay <b>nodes</b> is equal between two <b>adjacent</b> sensing <b>nodes</b> or the sink node and the sensing node. The relay nodes closer to the sink node assume larger data forwarding capacity, and a smaller deployment interval should be adopted; however, the relay nodes with far distance from the sink node assume smaller data forwarding capacity, and larger deployment spacing should be adopted, as far as possible, each relay node consumes the same energy in single data forwarding. Therefore, for the two <b>adjacent</b> sensing <b>nodes</b> which are closer to the sink node or between the sink node and the sensing node, the relay nodes should be more densely deployed. When the number of relay nodes that can be deployed {{is the same as}} that of the average deployment strategy, the unevenly optimized deployment strategy can make the energy consumption of all relay nodes in the network balanced, which can prolong the network life cycle and improve the network efficiency. Therefore, a mathematical model based on this strategy can be established to solve the problem of the total number of relay nodes; the number of relay nodes should be deployed between the two <b>adjacent</b> sensing <b>nodes</b> or the sink node and the sensing node, so that the network efficiency can be maximized.|$|R
