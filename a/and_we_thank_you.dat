60|$|But from Bruxelles, {{knowing how}} the Lady Castlewood always {{liked to have}} a letter about the famous 29th of December, my lord writ her a long and full one, and in this he must have {{described}} the affair with Mohun; for when Mr. Esmond came to visit his mistress one day, early in the new year, to his great wonderment, she and her daughter both came up and saluted him, and after them the dowager of Chelsea, too, whose chairman had just brought her ladyship from her village to Kensington across the fields. After this honour, I say, from the two ladies of Castlewood, the dowager came forward in great state, with her grand tall head-dress of King James’s reign, that she never forsook, and said, “Cousin Henry, all our family have met; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you,</b> cousin, for your noble conduct towards the head of our house.” And pointing to her blushing cheek, she made Mr. Esmond {{aware that he was}} to enjoy the rapture of an embrace there. Having saluted one cheek, she turned to him the other. “Cousin Harry,” said both the other ladies, in a little chorus, “we thank you for your noble conduct;” and then Harry became aware that the story of the Lille affair had come to his kinswomen’s ears. It pleased him to hear them all saluting him as one of their family.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the same}} day the American crewmembers were {{released}} with their vessels, Iran released a series of images and videos which, among other things, showed the U.S. navy sailors on their knees with their hands clasped behind their heads as they were being apprehended on their vessels. Two of the videos featured one of the Americans, apparently the lieutenant commanding the boats, apologizing and praising Iran's treatment: [...] "It was a mistake that was our fault, and we apologize for our mistake... The Iranian behavior was fantastic while we were here <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> very much for your hospitality and your assistance." [...] According to Politico, these pictures and footage further [...] "inflamed the American debate over sailors' capture, including {{the question of whether the}} U.S. had formally apologized for entering Iranian territory." [...] Michael Pregent, an adjunct fellow at the Hudson Institute and a retired U.S. military officer, said the photos and video, which were used for propaganda purposes and made the sailors readily identifiable, violated articles 13 and 17 of the Geneva Convention. [...] US State Department Spokesman John Kirby addressed the issue, explaining [...] "the Geneva Convention applies for wartime. We’re not at war with Iran". A Defense Department official said that the Navy lieutenant’s filmed apology was probably intended to defuse a potentially volatile situation.|$|E
