5|$|After {{securing}} {{additional financing}} from Eurimages and <b>ARTE,</b> Tarr used these and the Hungarian funds to undertake nine days of shooting on sets {{he had built}} {{at a cost of}} €2 million. The French funding was cross-financed for the shoot by T. T. Filmműhely. As funds were frozen however, the Corsican subcontractor Tanit Films (controlled by the film's then-executive producer Jean-Patrick Costantini), terminated their contract with Balsan and through legal action compelled the production to dismantle the sets and leave the shooting location. At that point, Ognon Pictures shut the production down and disassociated themselves from the film, and Tarr withdrew to Hungary to regroup.|$|E

5|$|Allowing the enpassant capture, {{together}} {{with the introduction of}} the two-square first move for pawns, {{was one of the last}} major rule changes in European chess, and occurred between 1200 and 1600. Other relatively recent rule changes were castling, the unlimited range for queens and bishops (Spanish master Ruy López de Segura gives the rule in his 1561 book Libro de la invencion liberal y <b>arte</b> del juego del axedrez) and a change to the rules on pawn promotion. In most places the en passant rule was adopted at the same time as allowing the pawn to move two squares on its first move, but it was not universally accepted until the Italian rules were changed in 1880.|$|E

500|$|Battles {{take place}} in real-time. Player actions include moving, dashing, {{standard}} attacks, and artes; <b>artes</b> are special attacks which consume [...] "Technical Points" [...] (TP), the in-game synonym for magic points.

Party members are able to link to each other to perform unified attacks called linked <b>artes.</b> While linked, the supporting partner provides unique abilities to the character, while also increasing the Linked <b>Artes</b> Gauge. When the Linked <b>Artes</b> Gauge is full, the player character can enter Over Limit which gives them immunity to stagger, unlimited AC, and allows them to use linked <b>artes</b> in succession.|$|R

5|$|Villani {{was sent}} on another {{diplomatic}} mission in 1329, {{this time to}} Bologna to meet Cardinal Bertrand de Pouget. From 1330 to 1331 he superintended the making of Andrea Pisano's bronze doors for the Baptistry. At the same time, he served as the consul for his guild of the <b>Arte</b> di Calimala and watched over the raising of the campanile of the Badìa. He was also sent with others as a hostage to Ferrara, to ensure that Florence made good on a debt; he resided there for some months in 1341.|$|E
5|$|Writings {{about the}} theory of how to play chess {{began to appear in}} the 15thcentury. The Repetición de Amores y <b>Arte</b> de Ajedrez (Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess) by Spanish churchman Luis Ramirez de Lucena was {{published}} in Salamanca in 1497. Lucena and later masters like Portuguese Pedro Damiano, Italians Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona, Giulio Cesare Polerio and Gioachino Greco, and Spanish bishop Ruy López de Segura developed elements of openings and started to analyze simple endgames.|$|E
5|$|Expressions {{of sympathy}} and {{solidarity}} from the European film community manifested in renewed assurances of continued {{support from the}} production's German partners, <b>ARTE,</b> and the French National Film Centre (whose support was conditional on the film having 51% of its dialogue in French). New French financing was secured from production company Mezzanine Film, and in Hungary, the Hungarian Motion Picture Foundation (MMKA) and the Minister of Culture pledged to back the production if a guarantee could {{be made that the}} film would be finished safely. A compromise filming schedule was negotiated whereby a quarter of the shoot would take place in Eastern Europe rather than Corsica and fewer shooting days would be allotted. This allowed the original €5 million budget to be reduced by €700,000 to the amount available. With the funding promises secured and a revised shooting schedule, the film's producers forged a new co-production contract in July 2005.|$|E

5|$|In 1743, Smart {{pushed his}} {{translation}} of Pope's Ode on St. Cecilia's Day as Carmen Cl. Alexandri Pope in S. Caeciliam Latine Redditum {{and paid for}} the publication himself. With this translation, he wanted to win Pope's favour and translate Pope's Essay on Man, but Pope rejected the idea and, after a lettered response and a possible meeting between the two, Smart translated Pope's An Essay on Criticism (De <b>Arte</b> Critica) instead. The initial letter sent from Pope recommending the future translation was prized by Smart. In response to this letter and his budding relationship with Pope, the Pembroke Fellows honoured him with a portrait showing him holding the letter from Pope and allowed him to write a poem in celebration of Jubilee of Pembroke's 400th year in 1744.|$|E

5|$|Giovanni Villani {{was born}} into the Florentine {{merchant}} middle class. He {{was the son of}} Villano di Stoldi di Bellincione, who came from an old and well-respected arti maggiori family of merchants. Villani {{was a member of the}} <b>Arte</b> di Calimala (wool finishers) guild in Florence since 1300, serving on the mercanzia council of eight. During that year he visited Rome during the jubilee celebration. After observing the well-known ancient monuments of Rome and acknowledging its renowned historical personages, he was inspired to write the Cronica, a universal history of Florence in a strictly linear, year-by-year format. During the early years of the 14th century, he gained political perspective by travelling throughout Italy, Switzerland, France and Flanders for the Peruzzi bank, of which he was a shareholder from 1300 to 1308. Traveling abroad as a factor for the company, Villani was paid a regular salary in addition to his shareholding profits. On May 15, 1306, one of the first exchange contracts (cambium) to mention the city of Bruges involved two parties: Giovanni Villani, representing the Peruzzi Company, granting a loan to Tommaso Fini, representing the Gallerani Company of Siena. Villani and his brother Matteo transferred most of their economic activities to the Buonaccorsi firm by 1322. Giovanni Villani was a co-director of Buonaccorsi in 1324. The Buonaccorsi handled banking and commodity trade activities, spreading their influence throughout Italy, France, Flanders, England and several places in the Mediterranean.|$|E
