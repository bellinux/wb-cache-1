5|$|An initial {{attempt to}} bring a {{professional}} ice hockey team to Nottingham was made in 1939 following {{the completion of the}} Ice Stadium in Nottingham City Centre. A team was assembled <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> the United Kingdom from Canada to compete in the 1939–40 English National League season but were promptly sent home having not played a single game due to the outbreak of World War II. Seven years later, after the war had ended, a second effort to bring ice hockey to the city was begun. With a team of Canadians largely from Winnipeg, Manitoba, the Nottingham Panthers played their first competitive game on 22 November 1946 with a 3–2 home victory over the Wembley Monarchs.|$|E

5|$|An {{inventory}} {{drawn up}} at the Hôtel de la Reine after Catherine's death shows her {{to have been a}} keen collector. Listed works of art included tapestries, hand-drawn maps, sculptures, rich fabrics, ebony furniture inlaid with ivory, sets of china, and Limoges pottery. There were also hundreds of portraits, for which a vogue had developed during Catherine's lifetime. Many portraits in her collection were by Jean Clouet (1480–1541) and his son François Clouet (1572). François Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family and of many members of the court. After Catherine's death, a decline in the quality of French portraiture set in. By 1610, the school patronised by the late Valois court <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> its pinnacle by François Clouet had all but died out.|$|E

Most of the understory plants and animals from the upper spruce-fir zone, however, {{can be found in}} this forest. Moisture causes nutrients to be stripped from the soil <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> lower elevations, and decomposition takes place at a rate that is too slow to replenish them.|$|E

The body was identified there as Booth's by more than ten people who knew him. Among the identifying features used {{to make sure that the}} man that was killed was Booth was a tattoo on his left hand with his initials J.W.B., and a distinct scar on the back of his neck.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, {{businessmen}} in the Washington, D.C. area became involved and greatly expanded {{the program with}} the Christmas Pageant of Peace. The Pageant centered around the lighting of the Christmas tree, and included various elements such as a life-sized reproduction of the nativity scene. Every year from 1954 to 1972, a tree was cut <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> the White House from a different US state and installed at the Ellipse. The ceremony of the tree lighting was then followed by Christmas presentations through the holiday season.|$|E

5|$|In {{adopting}} Christianity as {{the state}} religion, Mieszko sought to achieve several personal goals. He saw Poland's baptism {{as a way of}} strengthening his hold on power, as well as using it as a unifying force for the Polish people. It replaced several smaller cults with a single, central one, clearly associated with the royal court. It would also improve the position and respectability of the Polish state on the international, European scene. The Church also helped to strengthen the monarch's authority, <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Poland much experience with regard to state administration. Thus, the Church organisation supported the state, and in return, bishops received important government titles (in the later era, they were members of the Senate of Poland).|$|E
