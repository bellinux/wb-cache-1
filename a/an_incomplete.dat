5|$|Tech's post-touchdown kickoff bounced to the Clemson two-yard line {{before it}} was {{returned}} to the Clemson 12-yard line. <b>An</b> <b>incomplete</b> pass on first down {{was followed by a}} first-down pass to Gardner at the 22-yard line. Dantzler then completed a pass to Watts at the 34-yard line for another first down. After <b>an</b> <b>incomplete</b> pass, Dantzler scrambled for a first down at the Clemson 47-yard line, where he completed a 17-yard pass to Robinson as time ticked below one minute remaining. From the Tech 36-yard line, Dantzler completed a pass to Gardner at the Tech 29-yard line. After a time out with 33 seconds remaining, Dantzler threw <b>an</b> <b>incomplete</b> pass. This was followed by another incomplete pass, and Clemson converted the first down with a pass to the Tech 24-yard line. <b>An</b> <b>incomplete</b> pass on first down was followed by another on second down. Following the play, there was only eight seconds left on the clock, and coach Bowden ordered Hunt into the game to attempt a 41-yard field goal. The kick was short and to the right, and Clemson turned the ball over with two seconds remaining. Vick took a knee to run the final seconds off the clock, and Virginia Tech entered halftime with a 2110 lead.|$|E

5|$|Florida State {{received}} the Tech kickoff {{and returned it}} to their 23-yard line. After <b>an</b> <b>incomplete</b> pass from Rix, Virginia Tech's defense was caught offsides, resulting in a five-yard gain for Florida State. A short run after the penalty gained a first down, but on the first play after the first down, the Seminoles fumbled the ball. The loose ball was recovered by Virginia Tech's defense, and the Hokies began their second possession {{of the second half}} at the State 31-yard line. Tech was unable to capitalize on the field position, however. Noel threw <b>an</b> <b>incomplete</b> pass, was sacked, then threw a pass for a loss of yardage.

5|$|In {{possession}} of the ball and a large lead, Virginia Tech proceeded to start running out the clock by executing running plays, which do not halt the game clock at their conclusion as do incomplete passing plays. Suggs gained nine yards on a run up the middle, then Ferguson was tackled for a loss after <b>an</b> <b>incomplete</b> pass by Vick. Tech punted, and the ball was downed at the 26-yard line. Following the punt, Clemson put backup quarterback Willie Simmons into the game. On his first play, Simmons was sacked by Jim Davis for a five-yard loss. The second play was {{a repeat of the}} first, as Davis again sacked Simmons, this time for an 11-yard loss. On third down, Simmons threw <b>an</b> <b>incomplete</b> pass, and Clemson punted after going three and out.|$|E

5|$|Tech's post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Eagles' 30-yard line. Davis started the drive with <b>an</b> <b>incomplete</b> pass, then Harris gained seven yards with a rush up the middle. A third-down pass fell incomplete, and Boston College punted. The kick was fair caught at the Tech 30-yard line, and with 5:01 left in the quarter, the Hokies returned to offense. On the first play, Taylor ran 11 yards for a first down. Taylor threw <b>an</b> <b>incomplete</b> pass, and the Hokies were penalized 10 yards for holding, pushing {{them back to the}} 31-yard line. Tech was unable to regain the lost yardage, and punted. The kick was 57 yards, and Boston College was further backed up by a penalty during the return. Following the kick, Boston College's offense was forced back to its seven-yard line to start. <b>An</b> <b>incomplete</b> pass was followed by a scramble by Davis. During the run, Davis fumbled the ball, which was recovered by a Boston College player. Facing third down, Davis scrambled again, this time for a first down to the 21-yard line. On the first play after the first down scramble, a deep pass downfield by Davis was intercepted by Virginia Tech's Stephan Virgil. The interception {{was returned}} to the Boston College 10-yard line, and on the first play by Tech's offense, Evans ran the ten yards for a touchdown. The extra point was good, and with 1:17 remaining, the Hokies extended their lead to 24–7.|$|E
