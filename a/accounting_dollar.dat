40|$|Debates over {{economic}} policy {{tend to be}} enormously confused. It {{is often the case}} that even high-level officials and well-known economists seem ignorant of basic accounting identities. This leads them to make claims that literally do not add up. This seems to be especially common in the case of debates on trade policy. This paper is intended to clarify some of the key issues. The first part is a simple accounting exercise showing that a large trade deficit implies that a country must either have a large budget deficit, negative private savings, or some combination of the two. Since both large budget deficits and negative private savings are generally viewed as undesirable, this means that a lower trade deficit should be a top policy priority. Furthermore, as a practical matter, a lower-valued dollar is the only plausible mechanism for getting the trade deficit closer to balanced. The second section shows the implications of a lower trade deficit for the economy in terms of the sectors that will expand. While some analysts have implied that in the future the United States will no longer be engaged in manufacturing, this is not a plausible economic scenario. If the United States will continue to consume manufactured goods then it will have to produce the bulk of these goods itself. There is no sector of the economy where exports can reasonably be expected to expand enough to pay for the country’s consumption of manufactured goods. The final section discusses mechanisms for lowering {{the value of the dollar}}. In public debates, the value of the dollar is often treated as being beyond the control of the U. S. government. This is not true. The government certainly has the ability to influence the value of the dollar; however it may be necessary to sacrifice other policy goals to achieve a desired exchange rate for the dollar. trade, trade deficit, budget, budget deficit, national <b>accounting,</b> <b>dollar,</b> currency...|$|E

40|$|Two main forces lie {{behind the}} large U. S. current account deficits: an {{increase}} in U. S. demand for foreign goods and {{an increase in}} foreign demand for U. S. assets. Both have contributed to steadily increasing current account deficits since the mid- 1990 s, accompanied by a real dollar appreciation until late 2001 and a real depreciation since, which accelerated in late 2004. This paper explores whether and how much more depreciation is to come, and against which currencies: the euro, the yen, or the renminbi. The paper develops a simple model of exchange rate and current account determination based on imperfect substitutability in both goods and asset markets and uses that model to interpret the past and explore alternative future scenarios. The paper concludes that substantially more depreciation is to come, surely against the yen and the renminbi, and probably against the euro. macroeconomics, International Investors, U. S.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the discussion}} of a substitution account in the 1970 s and how the account might have performed had it been agreed in 1980. The substitution account would have allowed central banks to diversify away from the dollar into the IMF's Special Drawing Right (SDR), comprised of US dollar, Deutsche mark, French franc (later euro), Japanese yen and British pound, through transactions conducted off the market. The <b>account's</b> <b>dollar</b> assets could fall short {{of the value of}} its SDR liabilities, and hedging would have defeated the purpose of preventing dollar sales. In the event, negotiators were unable to agree on how to distribute the open-ended cost of covering any shortfall if the dollar's depreciation were to exceed the value of any cumulative interest rate premium on the dollar. As it turned out, the substitution account would have encountered solvency problems had the US dollar return been based on US Treasury bill yields, even if a substantial fraction of the IMF's gold had been devoted to meet the shortfall at recent, high prices for gold. However, had the US dollar return been based on US Treasury bond yields, the substitution account would have been solvent even without any gold backing...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{framework}} for the measurement of national income which generalises and unifies the existing approaches. We begin by defining the maximum discounted utility which the economy can achieve starting from any initial capital stock vector. Using this we can then immediately formalise the Hicksian notion of income as the maximum amount which the economy could consume at a particular moment of time and leave it just as well off (in terms of the maximum present value of future consumption) as it was before. The measure of income so derived is in units of <b>account</b> (<b>dollars).</b> We then derive three key results. (i) We show that under a mild assumption this definition is formally identical to that by Weitzman (1976). (ii) The correction terms for GNP advocated by Hartwick (1990) emerge as a special interpretation of this measure {{in the context of}} natural resource depletion. (iii) The interpretation which Weitzman gave to national income as a permanent income measure of the economy’s future consumption possibilities (its wealth) carries over to this context. The only difference is that, since interest rates are not in general constant, the appropriate rate of interest to use is in establishing this connection between income and wealth is a consumption-weighted average of the interest rates on the optimum path...|$|R
