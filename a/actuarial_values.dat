The loss {{in any given}} period is generated by the Weibull distribution with a known shape parameter but an unknown scale parameter. The insurer {{is assumed to be}} a Bayesian decision maker, in the sense that he/she learns sequentially about the unknown scale parameter by observing the realizations of the filed claims. It is shown that the insurer's underlying predictive loss distributions belong to the Burr family, and the multi-period actuarially fair policy value can be derived. With a proper loading, an insurance premium can be quoted. Our major contribution is the analytical derivations of the fair <b>actuarial</b> <b>values</b> for deductible insurance policies in the presence of parameter uncertainty and Bayesian learning.

Since 2004, more employers have offered plans with higher deductibles coupled with employer-funded personal accounts. These arrangements can result in low out of pocket costs for many employees, but high users will face substantially higher costs. Many employers adopting high-deductible plans are not contributing to personal accounts. Those who are concerned about higher out-of-pockets might consider income-related cost sharing, educational efforts to communicate the savings that can result from using in-network providers, and continued availability of managed care options that limit out-of-pocket spending...|$|E

40|$|From 1972 to 1991, 237 {{patients}} with {{squamous cell carcinoma}} of the lower lip were treated by exclusive LDR brachytherapy (192 Ir). There were 158 T 1, 61 T 2, 17 T 3 and 1 T 4 with 231 N 0, 3 N 1 and 3 N 2 patients. The <b>actuarial</b> <b>values</b> at 5 years for local and regional controls, overall and specific survivals were 95 %, 91 %, 74 % and 91 %. Salvage treatment increased local control up to 99 % and regional control to 94 %. No heterolabial recurrence has been observed since the entire lip is treated, even for small tumors. The regional control depends closely on {{the thickness of the}} labial tumor (≥ 1 cm, p 1. 4 cm, p = 0. 018) and particularly to the thickness of normal tissue included in the 85 % isodose (treated thickness - tumoral thickness > 0. 4 cm, p = 0. 025). The use of a leaded protection and low linear radioactivity wires (< 2 mCi/cm, < 8. 6 μGy/h · m 2 /cm) especially for large target volumes is required to lessen late complications. Based on this review, we advocate exclusive brachytherapy for small and intermediate tumors, with elective bilateral submaxillary and submental dissection for thick, high grade or commissure tumors. Simple recommendations are made to assure quality of the brachytherapy treatment. © 1994. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{properties}} of equilibrium in insurance markets where insurers can obtain specific and private knowledge of the loss experience of their customers. We examine the case where firms obtain information over time from insurance claims and use these data in a Bayesian fashion to adjust individual premiums to experience. We first consider the case where firms can change their premiums from one period to the next and customers are free to stay or leave as they see fit. We refer to this case as a single period equilibrium. The resulting premium schedule earns monopoly profits even if entry by new firms into the insurance market is perfectly free. We next investigate a myopic multi- period equilibrium, in which firms maximize {{the present value of}} the stream of expected profits over the period in which the individual is insured, but individuals select the firm offering the lowest premiums. With free entry, expected profits are zero but premiums are generally too low or too high relative to <b>actuarial</b> <b>values.</b> We also investigate {{the properties of}} a full multi- period equilibrium where insurance firms specify premiums in advance for all future periods {{as a function of the}} number of claims that a customer has made within a given time span. In this type of equilibrium long-run profits are zero and insurance firms consciously charge actuarially unfair premiums to some of their customers. Although these models are illustrated in an insurance context, they also apply to other situations as well, notably labor markets.

For example, {{the provisions of the}} Italian severance pay statute require that, in most cases, the benefit an employee has accrued for service to date is payable immediately upon separation. The undiscounted value of that benefit payable currently would exceed the <b>actuarial</b> present <b>value</b> of that benefit if payment is estimated to occur at the employee's expected termination date. Another example arises in the United Kingdom where legislation requires that deferred vested benefits of terminated employees be statutorily revalued from date of separation to normal retirement age. If the vested benefit obligation (VBO) is determined assuming employee termination at the measurement date, that VBO could exceed the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) if that obligation is measured giving consideration to a statutory revaluation only after the employee's expected date of termination.

There were minimal legislative and regulatory constraints, particularly where the conversion was achieved by amendment {{to the rules of}} the fund rather than transfer to another fund.
