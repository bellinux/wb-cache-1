40|$|Cracks on {{the surface}} of civil {{structures}} (e. g. pavement sections, concrete structures) progress in several formations and under different deterioration mechanisms. In monitoring practice, it is often that cracking type with its worst damage level is selected as a representative condition state, while other cracking types and their damage levels are neglected in records, remaining as hidden information. Therefore, the practice in monitoring has a potential to conceal with a bias selection process, which possibly result in not optimal intervention strategies. In overcoming these problems, our paper presents a non-homogeneous Markov hazard model, with competing hazard rates. Cracking condition states are classified in three types (longitudinal crack, horizontal crack, and <b>alligator</b> <b>crack),</b> with three respective damage levels. The dynamic selection of cracking condition states are undergone a competing process of cracking types and damage levels.

A total of 20 individual inputs were evaluated by studying the effect of each input on five different performance measures (longitudinal <b>cracking,</b> <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> transverse cracking, rutting, and roughness) for each pavement structure resulting in about 200 simulations using the MEPDG software.

40|$|Abstract:- Pavements usually {{experience}} {{different types}} of distresses due to repeated traffic loads, aggressive environmental conditions, construction materials, soil condition of the underline subgrade, and the method of construction. Longitudinal and transverse cracking, potholes, rutting, and bleeding are common examples of such distresses associated with flexible pavements. As time progresses, the severity of these distresses increases and consequently, ride quality is adversely affected. Early detection and measurement {{of the extent of}} distresses coupled with prompt reactive measures are necessary to keep the pavement function at an acceptable level. Traditional methods for distress detection and measurement are laborious, time consuming, and subject the involved personnel to accidents. In contrast, image measurement methods are effortless, safe, and can be performed in a short time. This research paper performs image processing measurements to estimate areas of a pothole and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> and sets a program for plane measurements of an area that experience rutting. The image measurements are compared with the traditional measurements. The results show that image measurements are close to those obtained by using the traditional methods.

40|$|A {{database}} of dynamic modulus values for typical Superpave mixes {{widely used in}} the state of Washington was developed and used to investigate the sensitivity of the dynamic modulus to aggregate gradation. Seven JMF mixes were selected for the study. Percent passing sieve # 200 of these mixes were changed by ± 2 % to prepare additional mixes referred to as ‘modified mixes’. Statistical analysis showed that using different JMF mixes significantly affected the dynamic modulus. This was not the case when modifying the JMF by changing the percent passing # 200. A simple evaluation of the prediction accuracy of the 2002 Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) was conducted in which the measured dynamic modulus was used as a key input parameter to predict pavement distresses. Level 1 and Level 3 predictions of rutting, longitudinal <b>cracking,</b> <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> and IRI were compared with the field performance data. The Design Guide predicted IRI and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking</b> reasonably well. The predicted rutting of the JMF mixes agreed well with the dynamic modulus trend.

But before the rehabilitation is carried out, it is required to evaluate the road pavement condition. The objective {{of this study is}} to appraise or to value the road pavement condition. This research implementation was visually completed by using Pavement Condition Index Method. It was started by dividing the road into several research units in 100 x 3. 5 m by size for each unit sample.

40|$|Pavement design {{procedures}} {{available in}} the literature do not fully take advantage of mechanistic design concepts, and as a result, heavily rely on empirical approaches. However, reliance on empirical solutions can be reduced by introducing mechanistic-empirical methods, now adopted in the newly released Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG). Thermal properties like, {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE), thermal conductivity, heat capacity, surface shortwave absorptivity, ultimate shrinkage strain, mix coefficient of thermal contraction, which control the flow of heat through pavements constitute the primary inputs to MEPDG.;A study was undertaken to compare the sensitivity of thermal input parameters on the performance of concrete and flexible pavements using MEPDG Version 1. 0. Effect of climate on the pavement performance was also evaluated. Results from all the simulations showed that almost all of the cases produce reasonable values for transverse cracking, faulting, punchouts, rutting, <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> IRI. The transverse cracking model in jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP) is sensitive to coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), thermal conductivity and climate. Faulting values are sensitive to dowels, thermal conductivity, co-efficient of thermal expansion, surface shortwave absorptivity (SSA) and climate zone. Punchouts are most sensitive to CTE. In flexible pavements airvoid content, traffic volume, and thickness of the asphalt layer, SSA and climate zone are the most sensitive parameters which affect rutting and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking.</b> However, there are cases for which model predictions disagree with prevailing knowledge in pavement engineering.

50|$|Fatigue cracking, {{also called}} {{crocodile}} <b>cracking</b> or <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> {{is a common}} type of distress in asphalt pavement. Fatigue cracking is characterized by interconnecting or interlaced cracking in the asphalt layer resembling the hide of a crocodile. Cell sizes can vary in size up to 11.80 in across, but are typically less than 5.90 in across. Fatigue cracking is generally a loading failure, but numerous factors can contribute to it. It is often a sign of sub-base failure, poor drainage, or repeated over-loadings. It is important to prevent fatigue cracking, and repair as soon as possible, as advanced cases can be very costly to repair {{and can lead to}} formation of potholes or premature pavement failure.|$|R
40|$|The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) is in {{the process}} of {{implementing}} the recently introduced AASHTO Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) for new pavement sections. However, the vast majority of pavement work conducted by ODOT involves rehabilitation of existing pavements. Hot mix asphalt (HMA) overlays are the preferred rehabilitation treatment for both flexible and rigid pavements in Oregon. However, like new work sections, HMA overlays are also susceptible to fatigue <b>cracking</b> (<b>alligator</b> <b>cracking</b> and longitudinal cracking), rutting, and thermal cracking. Additional work was therefore needed to calibrate the design process for rehabilitation of existing pavement structures. 38 pavement sections throughout Oregon were included in this calibration study. A detailed comparison of predictive and measured distresses was made using the MEPDG released software Darwin M-E (Version 1. 1). It was found that Darwin M-E predictive distresses did not accurately reflect measured distresses, calling for a local calibration of performance prediction models was warranted. Four distress prediction models (rutting, <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> longitudinal cracking, and thermal cracking) of the HMA overlays were calibrated for Oregon conditions. A comparison was made between the results before and after the calibration to assess the improvement in accuracy of the distress prediction models provided by the local calibration. While the thermal cracking model could not be calibrated, the locally calibrated models of rutting, <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> and longitudinal cracking provided better predictions with lower bias and standard error than the nationally (default) calibrated models. However, there was a high degree of variability between the predicted and measured distresses, especially for longitudinal cracking, even after the calibration. It is believed that there is a significant lack-of-fit modeling error for the occurrence of thermal cracks. The Darwin M-E calibrated models of rutting and <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking</b> can be implemented, however, it is recommended that additional sites, which would contain more detailed inputs (mostly Level 1), be established and be included in the future calibration efforts and thus, further improve the accuracy of the prediction models. Recently, the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) has identified hot mix asphalt concrete (HMAC) pavements that have displayed top-down cracking within three years of construction. The objective of the study was to evaluate the top-down cracked pavement sections and compare the results with the non-cracked pavement sections. Research involved evaluating six surface cracked pavements and four non-cracked pavement sections. The research included extensive field and laboratory investigations of the 10 pavement sections by conducting distress surveys, falling weight deflectometer (FWD) testing, dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) testing, and coring from the cracked and non-cracked pavement sections. Cores were then subjected to a full laboratory-testing program to evaluate the HMAC mixtures and binder rheology. The laboratory investigation included dynamic modulus, indirect tensile (IDT) strength, and specific gravity testing on the HMAC cores, binder rheological tests on asphalt binder and aggregate gradation analysis. The FWD and DCP tests indicated that top-down cracked pavement sections were structurally sound, even some of the sections with top-down cracking showed better structural capacity compared to non-cracked sections. The study also found that top-down cracking initiation and propagation were independent of pavement cross-section or the HMAC thickness. The dynamic modulus testing indicated that cores from all the top-down cracked pavement sections except one section (OR 140) possessed stiffer mixtures than that of non-cracked pavement sections. All four non-cracked pavement areas were found to be exhibiting fairly high IDT strength, and low variability in IDT strength and HMAC density when compared to top-down cracked sections as indicated by the IDT strength tests and air void analysis. Asphalt binder rheological test result indicated that asphalt binders from all the top-down cracked sections except OR 140 showed higher complex shear modulus (stiffer binder) compared to non-cracked pavement sections. The study concluded that top-down cracking could be caused by a number of contributors such as stiffer HMAC mixtures, mixture segregation, binder aging, low HMAC tensile strength, and high variability in tensile strength or by combination of any...|$|R

This study proposes a cost-effective Kinect-based approach for 3 D pavement surface reconstruction and cracking recognition, in which a series of robust detection and recognition algorithms have been made advantage of to identify 3 D cloud-point-data-based pavement distress feature.

In this paper, a back propagation neural network (BPNN) is used to recognize pavement cracks from images. To improve the recognition accuracy of the BPNN, a complete framework of image processing is proposed including image preprocessing and crack information extraction. In this framework, the redundant image information is reduced as much as possible and two sets of feature parameters are constructed to classify the crack images.

40|$|Fatigue damage can {{be defined}} by a {{decrease}} in stiffness of Asphalt Concrete (AC) under repeated traffic loading. For each cycle of traffic loading, tensile strain develops {{at the bottom of}} AC layer of an asphalt pavement. Some localized damages occur in the material at minute-scale due to this developed tensile strain. These damages cause decrease in stiffness (E) of AC. Damage caused by a single vehicle is small. However the accumulated damage is not small if a large number of vehicles are considered over the design life of an asphalt pavement. After certain level of damage accumulation, bottom-up fatigue cracking initiates and forms <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking</b> at the surface. Like traffic loading, repeated day-night temperature cycle causes damages in AC. Damage due to a single day-night temperature fluctuation may be small. However the accumulated damage due to a large number of day-night temperature cycles may not be small. In this study, fatigue damage due to traffic loading is termed as traffic-induced fatigue damage, and fatigue damage due to temperature is termed as temperature-induced fatigue damage. The recently developed AASHTOWare Pavement Mechanistic-Empirical (ME) Design Guide predicts the fatigue performance of AC based on repeated traffic-induced tensile strain at the bottom of AC layer. Cyclic thermal strain due to day-night temperature fluctuation is not considered {{due to the fact that}} there is no closed-form solution or model available for calculating thermal fatigue damage. This study, for the first time, develops a closed-form equation for calculating the temperature-induced fatigue damage of AC. To develop the model, beam fatigue testing was conducted using different AC mixtures in the laboratory. The mechanical beam fatigue test data was correlated with the actual cyclic temperature loading test data. The model was then validated using an unknown test data. To that end, the developed model was calibrated for field conditions using the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) test data. The developed model is used to evaluate fatigue damages of 34 Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) test sections. Fatigue damage predicted by the traditional AASHTOWare Pavement ME Design approach, which considers only traffic-induced fatigue damage, is compared to the fatigue damage by the developed model which considers both traffic- and temperature-induced fatigue. Results show that the error may decrease by up to 29 % through the incorporation of temperature-induced fatigue damage in the AASHTOWare Pavement ME Design approach. This means the reliability of <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking</b> prediction can be improved through the use of the developed thermal fatigue model. It is therefore suggested to include the temperature-induced fatigue damage model, which is developed in this study, in the AASHTOWare Pavement ME Design Software.

The M-E PDG 2002 (Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide v. 1. 003) software allows to assess {{the effectiveness of}} a trial design relating to performance criteria defined by the designer, predicting the service life of the considered pavement system. In particular, it shows the evolvement of structural distresses, as bottom-up fatigue (or <b>alligator)</b> <b>cracking,</b> surface-down fatigue (longitudinal) cracking, permanent deformations (rutting) and thermal cracking, through the design life, evaluating the influence of materials characteristics, thickness of layers, climate and traffic on pavement service life. In this paper the Authors show the results obtained using the above-mentioned software, adopting different pavements typologies (conventional, full-depth, semi-rigid, inverted-section), in order to determinate design solutions which are suitable for inhibiting or limiting the cracking phenomenon and the rutting, evaluating the influence of design parameters. In such way, the study offers useful suggestions that can be used by asphalt pavement designers to reduce in particular the possibility of premature cracking, so as to increase the service life of pavement system...|$|R
40|$|Highway is {{the land}} path {{on the surface of}} earth made by human being with its forms, sizes and {{construction}} types {{so that it can be}} used to distribute human, animal and vehicle traffic transporting goods from one place to another easily and quickly. The observation was conducted on Tentara Pelajar Road in 2. 3 km length aiming to conduct an evaluation on road condition using Pavement Condition Index (PCI) method by dividing the road into several segments with 50 m interval. Then, every segment of road was observed (visually) and measured to identify the types of damage existing and assessed corresponding to PCI method. From the result of observation, the types of damage included <b>alligator</b> <b>cracking,</b> bleeding, block cracking, corrugation, longitudinal and transverse cracking, patching and utility cut patching, potholes, Bleeding, and Rutting. These damages only occurred in some segments and the repair was conducted based on the types of damage existing. It included fracture filling, local asphalt washing, sand spreading, and patching. Corresponding to the estimation of traffic density volume and soil supportability, layer thickness redesigning was conducted according to the planned age, 10 years. The hardening material used was LASTON Ms. 744. Then, from entire work, the total cost needed in the attempt of repairing and improving quality in Tentara Pelajar Colomadu Karanganyar Road km 0 + 000 – 2 + 300 in 2014 was IDR 1. 169. 459. 676, 98. - Keywords: Pavement Condition Index (PCI), LASTON, RAB...|$|R
40|$|The new Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) {{design and}} {{analysis}} procedures defines the exact traffic loading by defining the specific number of each vehicle {{class and the}} use of axle load distribution factors instead of the equivalent single axle load (ESAL). The number of traffic inputs (parameters) in MEPDG was found to be 17024. This research aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of the predicted flexible pavement distress to vehicle class and tire pressure in MEPDG. To evaluate the impact of vehicle (truck) class on pavement sections, different cases of loading were analyzed. For each case, the MEPDG Ver. 1. 1 was used to evaluate the effect of tire pressure by solving each case for a tire pressure of 120 and 140 psi. The effect of the traffic parameters on asphalt pavement (AC) rutting, base rutting, subgrade rutting, international roughness index (IRI), longitudinal <b>cracking</b> and fatigue (<b>alligator)</b> <b>cracking</b> were investigated. It was found that vehicle class distribution (VCD) would cause clear impact (comparable to the effect of AADTT level) only if the major traffic is of specific class (very light or very heavy). If this is not the case, the vehicle class distribution will not be a significant factor that affects the final design because most of the trucks had similar impact on flexible pavement distresses. The impact of tire pressure is clear on longitudinal cracking, fatigue cracking and AC rutting, and have no significant impact on both base and subgrade rutting...|$|R

The results obtained will be helpful {{in the preparation of}} the program and budgeting of road handling rehabilitation. Two methods can be used to assess the condition of the pavement damage are Bina Marga method and PCI method (pavement condition index), this research has the purpose to know the types of damage and compare both methods to know the value of the pavement condition and another alternative ways of handling according to the existing damage on Danliris Blulukan-Tohudan Colomadu Karanganyar roads. This research is done with damage pavement surface visual survey and also LHR survey (The average daily traffic) during a day on the roads, after obtained the data from the field then analyzed using the Bina Marga method and PCI method (pavement condition index).
