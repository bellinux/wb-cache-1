5|$|In October 1952, Holloman {{was signed}} by the St. Louis Browns after they traded Duke Markell and $35,000 to acquire him. Heading into the season, manager Marty Marion was high on him, {{considering}} {{him to be a}} pitcher who could have won 20 games with Syracuse the year prior had he not missed time due to an <b>appendectomy.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Scott had an <b>appendectomy</b> {{and learned}} that his {{appendix}} was cancerous. After going into remission, he was again diagnosed with cancer in 2011 and 2013.

50|$|About 327,000 <b>appendectomies</b> were {{performed}} during U.S. hospital stays in 2011, {{a rate of}} 10.5 procedures per 10,000 population. <b>Appendectomies</b> accounted for 2.1% of all operating-room procedures in 2011.|$|R
40|$|Background: Mounting {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} laparoscopic techniques {{for the treatment of}} simple appendicitis.

This study compares the treatment outcomes of laparoscopic <b>appendectomies</b> and open <b>appendectomies</b> performed in Taiwan...|$|R
40|$|Although between 4 % and 20 % of all <b>appendectomies</b> {{in adults}} are {{performed}} laparoscopically, {{this procedure is}} rarely done in the pediatric age group because of the substantially more difficult technique, the expected risks and suspected higher rate of complications. In a prospective study of 500 consecutive <b>appendectomies,</b> we tried to assess the actual rate of complications of each operative approach. We included 362 conventional and 138 laparoscopic <b>appendectomies,</b> {{the median age of}} the patients was 10. 8 years. The mortality was 0 in both groups...|$|R

She recuperated during a Caribbean cruise aboard the royal yacht, Britannia. In December 1966, she underwent an operation to remove a tumour after she was diagnosed with colon cancer. Contrary to rumours, she did not have a colostomy. In 1984, she {{was diagnosed with breast cancer}} and a lump was removed from her breast.|$|E
5|$|In November 1908, Beilhart {{became ill}} from acute appendicitis. Despite {{attention}} from a surgeon who performed an <b>appendectomy,</b> Beilhart developed peritonitis and died three days later. In {{keeping with the}} society's beliefs in simplicity, Beilhart was buried in a plain coffin in an unmarked grave overlooking Wooster Lake. None of the buildings remain, having been covered by a housing development, although Beilhart's grave remains in a brush-obscured corner of the tract.|$|E
5|$|Official Church {{teaching}} {{allows for}} medical procedures and treatments {{intended to protect}} or restore the mother's health if {{she would be in}} mortal danger without them, even when such procedures carry some risk of death to the fetus. Examples include the removal of a fallopian tube {{in the case of an}} ectopic pregnancy, removal of a pregnant cancerous uterus, or an <b>appendectomy.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to compare the {{outcomes}} of surgical interventions for acute appendicitis with the values of the Alvarado score. We conducted the study on 572 patients that underwent surgical interventions for acute appendicitis. Retrospectively, based on the medical records, we calculated the MANTRELS score and compared the outcomes of the intervention with the values of the applied score. Almost one third of the patients with a MANTRELS score lower than 6 had negative <b>appendectomies.</b> These patients represent 60 % of the total cases of negative <b>appendectomies,</b> while in the case of patients with a high score around 2 % had negative <b>appendectomies.</b> We concluded that using this scoring system to assess the need of immediate surgical intervention is important and can increase the rate of positive diagnosis mainly by limiting the number of unnecessary interventions...|$|R
50|$|In most cases, {{patients}} {{going in}} for surgery experience nausea or vomiting that requires medication before surgery. Antibiotics along with pain medication may be administrated before <b>appendectomies.</b>|$|R

5|$|Seven {{candidates}} declared their {{candidacy for}} the Democratic nomination, including Rhea and Lieutenant Governor Chandler. Former governor Beckham {{was not a}} candidate; his only son had died in late 1934, devastating his family and leaving his wife strongly opposed to another political campaign.

Two candidates dropped out of the race prior to the election.|$|E
5|$|Harris later volunteers {{herself to}} have an <b>appendectomy</b> to help the interns learn that {{surgical}} procedure, {{on the condition that}} she gets a chance to perform one afterwards. The interns make a mistake in the surgery, and Harris is seriously endangered, but is rescued by the residents. The interns are put on probation and rebuked by Meredith Grey, although Harris tells Lexie Grey that she is not apologetic. Following the surgery fiasco, Harris approaches the hospital's chief of surgery Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), and claims responsibility for the incident. He informs her that the reason she has not been fired is because of his personal friendship with her father.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the {{outcomes}} of laparoscopic <b>appendectomies</b> have compared favorably to those for open <b>appendectomies</b> because of decreased pain, fewer postoperative complications, shorter hospitalization, earlier mobilization, earlier return to work, and better cosmesis. However, despite these advantages, efforts are still being made to decrease abdominal incision and visible scars after laparoscopy. Recent research {{has led to the}} development of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). However, numerous difficulties need to be overcome before a wider clinical application of NOTES is adopted, including complications such as the opening of hollow viscera, failed sutures, a lack of fully developed instrumentation, and the necessity of reliable cost-benefit analyses.|$|R
40|$|Background: Studies {{during the}} 1990 s {{showed that it}} was {{possible}} to reduce the rate of negative <b>appendectomies</b> by using various diagnostic methods. The present study aims to evaluate the effect on diagnostic accuracy of implementation of repeated clinical examination and blood tests in a small county hospital without possibilities of radiological assistance on a 24 -hour basis. Methodology: Prospective study of all <b>appendectomies</b> performed at Ystad General Hospital, Sweden. Leukocyte count and C-reactive protein levels were analysed in all patients. Patients with suspicion of acute appendicitis were admitted for active observation, repeated clinical examination and analyses of leukocyte counts and CRP levels. Results: 533 <b>appendectomies</b> were performed during 1996 - 2000 and compared with the index year 1995. Diagnostic accuracy increased from 73 % to 90 % (p< 0. 01). The rates of perforations and complications did not change during the study period, being 12. 4 % and 5. 1 %, respectively. Coinciding with the increased accuracy, a drop in the number of <b>appendectomies</b> performed and a longer time interval from admittance to the start of operation was seen. Conclusion: Through repeated clinical examinations and blood tests it was prospectively possible to achieve an increase in diagnostic accuracy in patients with suspicion of acute appendicitis without any noticeable side effects.

50|$|A {{study of}} primary malignacies in the United States found {{a rate of}} 0.12 cases per 1,000,000 {{population}} per year. Carcinoids that were not identified as malignant {{were not included in}} this data. Carcinoid is found in roughly 1 in 300 <b>appendectomies</b> for acute appendicitis.A Hong Kong case series of 1492 <b>appendectomies</b> identified 17 neoplasms. Eight were carcinoids without specification of malignant features. Three cases of adenocarcinoma, and one each of cystadenocarcinoma, psedomyxoma peritoneii, and metastasic carcinoma were identified. The remaining tumors were benign. It was previously believed that carcinoid tumors are the most common tumors of the appendix but now data from the SEER program show that mucinous adenocarcinomas are more common.|$|R
5|$|In {{the same}} year Things Fall Apart was published, Achebe was {{promoted}} at the NBS and {{put in charge of}} the network's eastern region coverage. He moved to Enugu and began to work on his administrative duties. There he met a woman named Christiana Chinwe (Christie) Okoli, who had grown up in the area and joined the NBS staff when he arrived. They first conversed when she brought to his attention a pay discrepancy; a friend of hers found that, although they had been hired simultaneously, Christie had been rated lower and offered a lower wage. Sent to the hospital for an <b>appendectomy</b> soon after, she was pleasantly surprised when Achebe visited her with gifts and magazines.|$|E
5|$|Despite an {{emergency}} <b>appendectomy</b> that delayed his spring training and shortened {{his time to}} get in shape for the season, Hershiser had been named NL Baseball Pitcher of the Month in April and a participant in the 1988 All-Star Game, getting outs against all three batters. In the eight games he started between July 10 and August 14, Hershiser had a 3–4 win–loss record with a 4.76 earned run average (ERA), raising his season ERA from 2.46 to 3.06. Following his August 14 start in which he left the game after two innings (his shortest appearance since 1985) with the Dodgers behind the Giants 8–2, he pitched complete games on August 19 (a shutout) and August 24. Prior to the game, Hershiser trailed teammate Tim Leary in shutouts, six to three, and Leary also combined with other pitchers to record a shutout that was not counted in his individual total.|$|E
5|$|Kikai {{thought that}} {{work on a}} boat might be photogenic, but, having no experience, {{could not get a}} job on one. He was {{eventually}} accepted on a boat fishing for tuna when he displayed the scar from an unneeded <b>appendectomy</b> as evidence of one risk fewer that his presence might force the boat into port. He worked on the boat in the Pacific from 6 April until 9 November 1972, with a stop in Manzanillo (Mexico) for provisions. It was during this time that he took his first photographs to be published, in the May 1973 issue of Camera Mainichi. In 1973 he won a prize for his submission to the 14th exhibition of the Japan Advertising Photographers’ Association. But Kikai decided that in order to be a photographer he needed darkroom skills, and he returned to Tokyo to work at Doi Technical Photo (1973–76). He became a freelance photographer in 1984, a year after his first solo exhibition and the same year as his second.|$|E
50|$|The {{possibility}} of peritonitis {{is the reason}} why acute appendicitis warrants speedy evaluation and treatment. People with suspected appendicitis may have to undergo a medical evacuation. <b>Appendectomies</b> have occasionally been performed in emergency conditions (i.e., not in a proper hospital), when a timely medical evacuation was impossible.|$|R
50|$|Note that {{systems are}} radically {{different}} from networks and processes. Networks guarantee connection, but not interoperability or coherency; systems do.

5|$|Back in Seattle, Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) surprises his fiancée Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) with a visit. The couple reunites with {{constant}} sexual activity, {{for which the}} interns tease Bailey. Meanwhile, Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) allows Shepherd to operate on a spinal cord, despite his hand being broken from the plane crash. Thereafter, it is revealed that Sloan is in a comatose state, and will be taken off of life support that evening. In the hospital cafeteria, Meredith Grey announces that Wilson will be given the honor of performing a supervised <b>appendectomy,</b> a procedure historically used {{as a reward for}} interns. The hospital's chief of surgery, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), introduces the new pediatric surgery attending, Dr. Mel Barnett (Philip Casnoff), to Torres and Karev. Barnett informs Karev that he will not be continuing with the African orphan charity program (a function to treat ill children from Third World countries), something that was initially finalized by the latter and former chief of pediatric surgery, Robbins. Karev becomes upset about this, and asks Torres to prevent Barnett from discontinuing the program, though Torres shows no interest in helping Karev.|$|E
5|$|During Shepherd's surgery, {{his hand}} becomes numb, and he frustratedly exits the {{operating}} room. In the intern <b>appendectomy,</b> Wilson {{makes a mistake}} and freezes, leading to a scolding from Meredith Grey. Back in Minnesota, Yang is annoyed by the peppy attitudes of her superiors at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Craig Thomas (William Daniels) and Dr. Parker (Steven Culp), so she decides to take a trip to Seattle for Sloan's death. However, her PTSD hinders her from boarding the plane, and she ultimately remains in Minnesota. Meanwhile, Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), now a plastic surgical fellow, sits by Sloan's bedside and talks of medical cases to him. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) enters Sloan's hospital room and removes him from life support. Unable to cope with Sloan's death, Meredith Grey boards a plane to visit Yang, but panics before it takes off. Shortly thereafter, Meredith Grey finds Karev at the airport bar, where he reveals {{that he will be}} staying at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital. The next morning, Hunt visits Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) at her family's farm, and asks her to begin working in Seattle again. At the conclusion of the episode, Torres returns home to Robbins, who is revealed to have had her lower left leg amputated {{as a result of the}} crash.|$|E

5|$|On the November 16 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, Hardy and MVP dropped the WWE Tag Team Championship to John Morrison and The Miz. Despite {{the fact that}} Hardy was hurt, MVP {{immediately}} invoked the rematch clause. After the rematch, in which Hardy was forced to tap out, MVP attacked Hardy, repeatedly targeting his knee. It was later confirmed by WWE.com that Hardy had suffered an injury at his former partner's hands and {{that he might not}} be able to compete at Survivor Series. Despite his absence at the pay-per-view, his team was able to win the match. On November 21, WWE's official website reported that Hardy underwent an emergency <b>appendectomy</b> in Tampa, Florida. A CAT scan revealed an inflamed appendix after Hardy was feeling extreme pain. Later surgery revealed that his appendix had already burst. According to Hardy himself, on December 8 doctors back in North Carolina found an abscess of infection that had not been caught, and he had it drained, spending an additional several days in the hospital. Hardy made an appearance at the December 31 episode of Raw supporting his brother Jeff. To further Jeff's storyline with Randy Orton, however, Hardy was attacked by Orton. Hardy made his return at a live event in Muncie, Indiana on March 1, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Eberle {{made his}} NHL debut with the Oilers on October 7, 2010, against the Calgary Flames. He {{recorded}} his first goal, on the penalty kill {{in the third}} period, deking past defenceman Ian White on a two-on-one before scoring on a backhand deke past goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff. The goal was later voted by fans as the NHL's Goal of the Year on the League's Facebook page, as well as Play of the Year on The Sports Network's website. He later added an assist on the powerplay, taking a shot that deflected off teammate Shawn Horcoff's shinpads. The Oilers {{went on to win}} the game 4–0. Eberle was named the first star of the game. Later in the season, Eberle suffered a high ankle sprain after colliding with opposing forward Aleš Kotalík during a game against the Flames on January 1, 2011. While sidelined with the injury, he underwent an unrelated emergency <b>appendectomy</b> four days later. Missing 13 games with his ankle injury, he returned to action in early February. During a game against the Vancouver Canucks late in the season, on April 5, Eberle received a hit to the head from opposing forward Raffi Torres. While Eberle was not injured on the play, Torres received a four-game suspension for the hit. Eberle finished the season with 43 points (18 goals and 25 assists) in 69 games, leading his team in scoring and ranking sixth among league rookies. Though the Oilers finished with the worst record in the NHL for the second straight year, expectations remained high in Edmonton for the future of the team, as Eberle's success as a rookie was matched by the performance of fellow first-year forwards Taylor Hall and Magnus Pääjärvi.|$|E
40|$|In 2006, Massachusetts {{passed a}} health care reform which {{required}} individuals to purchase health insurance and provided subsidized health insurance to the poor. The reform greatly increased {{the proportion of the}} state population that was insured. In this study we use a large data set of private health insurance claims to analyze the effect of {{the increase in the number}} of insured on physician reimbursement. We find that reimbursement for well-infant visits rose by approximately 4 percent during the reform implementation period, but the increase did not persist. Reimbursement for well-adult visits and <b>appendectomies</b> remained unchanged. Triple difference estimates using <b>appendectomies</b> (for which demand is extremely inelastic) as an additional control group show a 2 percent rise in well-infant visit reimbursement during the implementation period and no effect afterwards or on well-adult visit reimbursement. Estimates imply a temporary increase in the cost of health services with relatively elastic demand following a large scale insurance mandate, such as the Affordable Care Act. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Foodborne Yersinia enterocolitica infections {{continue}} to be a public health problem in many countries. Consumption of raw or undercooked pork is the main risk factor for yersiniosis in Germany. Small children are most frequently affected by yersiniosis. In older children and young adults, symptoms of disease may resemble those of appendicitis and may lead to hospitalization and potentially unnecessary <b>appendectomies.</b> Y. enterocolitica infections may also cause sequelae such as reactive arthritis (ReA), erythema nodosum (EN), and conjunctivitis. Methods: We studied clinical aspects of yersiniosis, antimicrobial use, and self-reported occurrence of <b>appendectomies,</b> reactive arthritis, erythema nodosum and conjunctivitis. To assess post-infectious sequelae participants of a large population-based case–control study on laboratory-confirmed Y. enterocolitica infections conducted in Germany in 2009 – 2010 were followed for 4 weeks. Results: Diarrhea occurred most frequently in children ≤ 4 years (95 %); abdominal pain in the lower right quadrant was most common in children 5 – 14 years of age (63 %). Twenty-seven per cent of patients were hospitalized, 37 % were treated with antimicrobials. In 6 % of yersiniosis patients ≥ 5 years of age, <b>appendectomies</b> were performed. Self-reported symptoms consistent with ReA were reported by 12 % of yersiniosis patients compared to 5 % in a reference group not exposed to yersiniosis. Symptoms consistent with EN were reported by 3 % of yersiniosis patients compared to 0. 1 % in the reference group. Symptoms of conjunctivitis occurred with the same frequency in yersiniosis patients and the reference group. Conclusions: Acute Y. enterocolitica infections cause considerable burden of illness with symptoms lasting for about 10 days and hospitalizations in {{more than a quarter of}} patients. The proportion of yersiniosis patients treated with antimicrobial drugs appears to be relatively high despite guidelines recommending their use only in severe cases. <b>Appendectomies</b> and post-infectious complications (ReA and EN) are more frequently reported in yersiniosis patients than in the reference group suggesting that they can be attributed to infections with Y. enterocolitica. Physicians should keep recent Y. enterocolitica infection in mind in patients with symptoms resembling appendicitis as well as in patients with symptoms of unclear arthritis...|$|R
