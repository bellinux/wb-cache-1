This Thesis describes the process of environmental impact assessment (so called EIA) and its specifics, as well as its relevance for further administrative proceedings. Other subject of analyses is the integrated permit, a document that substitutes selected individual <b>administrative</b> <b>deeds,</b> and also the very permits, consents and statements intended to protect the individual environmental departments (such as air, water, landscape) or to regulate environmentally relevant activities (e. g. waste treatment). Subject of analyses are also the permission procedures pursuant to the Construction Act that ensure the protection of the common public interest on environment protection by the means of so called binding opinions of environmental protection authorities necessary in the land-use and construction permit issue proceedings as well as in other land-use planning activities. The aim of this Thesis is to describe specific aspects of the individual approval proceedings and their mutual procedural and factual correlation in order to eliminate interpretation difficulties caused by the fragmented legal regulation in the area of environmental protection legislation...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} legal {{protection}} {{of trees and}} bushes outside forests is regulated by the wildlife conservation act of 16 April 2004 and belongs to local government tasks. To fulfill these tasks the council is equipped with legal tools of various character. One of these tools concerning the protection of trees and bushes in urban and rural areas, which has been functioning in legislation for a long time, {{is the duty of}} property owners to get permission to remove trees and bushes. The duty in question is connected with the obligation to incur charge on account of such removal while the amount of the charge ought to be specified in the permission. However, in some cases legislator provides for exemption from both obtaining the permission and incurring charge. By contrast any removal of trees and bushes without required permission as well as violating other obligations connected with the protection of trees and bushes result in imposing a fine which amounts to triple charge of the removal. The tools mentioned above (permission to remove trees and bushes, charges for removal of trees and bushes approved by the permission, a mandatory penalty for the removal of trees and bushes without required permission and for the destruction of trees, bushes and greenery) are in the form of administrative decisions, so in theory they are <b>administrative</b> <b>deeds</b> issued by a local executive body: respectively by a borough leader, a mayor, or a city president.

Encroachment on unoccupied land belonging to the State and various other unauthorised methods accounted for large holdings.

Wheatstone, according to his own statement, remarked to Cooke that the method would not act, and produced his own experimental telegraph. Finally, Cooke proposed that they should enter into a partnership, but Wheatstone was at first reluctant to comply. He was a well-known man of science, and had meant to publish his results without seeking to make capital of them. Cooke, on the other hand, declared that his sole object {{was to make a}} fortune from the scheme. In May they agreed to join their forces, Wheatstone contributing the scientific, and Cooke the <b>administrative</b> talent. The <b>deed</b> of partnership was dated 19 November 1837.

This collection is a cornerstone of more than a century of scientific research in limnology, which also benefitted from frequent international contacts with scientists and ecological associations. The reorganization of the material in the Historical Archive was planned in consultation with the Soprintendenza Archivistica of the Piedmont Region, which is the legal authority responsible for the public archives in the Piedmont Region. Beginning in 2012, the information contained in the Archive has been digitized using the software xDams, an open version software source of Regesta?. In 2014, part of the digitized material was made available on the web site: [URL] These activities were conducted thanks to the contribution of the Fondazione Cassa Risparmio di Torino and Fondazione Comunitaria VCO, which funded two temporary staff for the reorganisation of the Historical Archive, including the physical preservation and digitalisation of the documents.

40|$|The archaeological {{research}} work, {{carried out}} during the spring campaigns in Ebla, and associated with the Archaeological Park project, answer the double need to perfect knowledge of contexts which have already been investigate, in terms of needs for conservation {{and in order to}} ensure the full visibility and long term maintenance of the main buildings which {{will be part of the}} tour for visitors to the city. These two simple methodological and theoretical rules, which were laid down consistently since the beginning of the first work on the field in 1997, are also a natural introduction to the interesting and unexpected results of the latest campaign in the central, south-eastern and south-western sectors of the renowned Royal Palace G. At the same time, they confirm – not that such confirmation is necessary – the extraordinary commitment which the «Italian Archaeological Mission in Syria» has shown in bringing together the professional and technical skills of young archaeologists, architects, topographers, restorers and students of what is known as the «Roman School of Oriental Archaeology». Concerning the first and certainly most important discovery, a series of indicators help us build hypotheses about the function of this small slot of two rooms, structurally added onto the Throne Room on the eastern sire. The discovery, in the small northern room, of 14 tablets and 2 splendid bullae, probably all located at a higher elevation – since none were found on the floor – indicate (as was said above) that one of the primary activities carried out there was, generally speaking, of a “complex” administrative nature: in fact, although the limited number of these documents can hardly make us see it as another small Archive, the presence of tablets and bullae together implies that at least two functions were carried out there: that of collecting documents and that of sealing goods. Also, the discovery on the floor of this room of one of the most extraordinary items of Early Bronze jewellery, unique in its kind and without any known comparison, on the one hand seems to confirm that the two rooms were used by important dignitaries; on the other hand, it could suggest – and an analysis of the texts would be decisive to this end – that in general the quality of the items kept there was very high, and high also the quality of the items which, before the famous sacking, were sealed there. Also, the semantic features of the two seal impressions which were found, though they have different techniques, style and articulation of the register, certainly cannot be referred to a common kind of sealing. One is more schematic and apparently represents a religious ceremony taking place in an aedicule; the other, plastic and with pretty relief style, takes us directly to the sphere of Early Bronze Syrian religiosity which always centres on the bull-man and on the lion. There seems to be no doubt that these very rich locations in the Throne Room of the Royal Palace G administered special items of great prestige, but it would be overreaching ourselves to say that these items were also the subject matter of administrative ratification, as the discovery of the small lot of written documents might lead us to think. Actually, their size, their firing, their state of preservation, the palaeography on them, advise us to pay a certain attention to the kind of transactions they regulated. In fact, if we were to assess them only on the basis of their physical and formal aspect, one might think of a kind of document which was not intended for long term conservation – unlike the well known documents housed in the main Archive – but were supposed to circulate easily, a sort of memo to provide an accurate record of the item administered. So if it seems impossible to recognize a direct association between the administration of the items found and the formal typological aspect of the written documentation, we must consider the small lot of documents independently. Certainly, the 14 tablets were not found by chance in the room, although it is likely that the room was not set aside to receive them as an archive; it is therefore reasonable to draw the hypothesis that the two rooms opened in the eastern sector of the Throne Room temporarily housed items of great value, and regulated some kind of official transaction which, before being filed in the archive, needed to undergo other kinds of approval, or – if this were not necessarily so – that the items were at least centrally controlled by those who had free access to these rooms. This new discovery in the Royal Palace G of Ebla, like others in the past, and in the recent past too, of Oriental archaeology, cannot be represented as a static function, and escapes any precise definition; however, with <b>administrative</b> <b>deeds,</b> we should not forget that before data are introduced into the places set aside for the conservation of their memory, research and consultation, the procedures followed natural steps, and this precious slot found in the Royal Palace G perhaps simply tells us about a location where one of these steps took place...|$|R
40|$|The {{doctorate}} thesis {{assigned to}} me {{deals with the}} problem of the effects of cancelling the tender procedure of a call for tenders on the contract stipulated in a judicial capacity {{in the course of the}} proceedings between the administration and the company, which turns out to have been unlawfully selected. As regards this question, the case law and legal theory have outlined solutions in terms of interpretation which are at two completely different ends of the spectrum (referring to the retractability, nullity and null and void agreement of the contract respectively) and which induces a set of questions regarding substantive and procedural law. The whole issue concerns the relations between the tender procedure and contract and the majority of the debate in fact centres on the nature (procedural or contractual) of the deed of adjudication. In order to correctly set out this research I therefore decided to dedicate the first part of the work to the problem of the nature of the deed of adjudication. In carrying out a similar survey, I deemed it necessary to take the steps from the traditional guidance that asserts the concurrence, in the tender procedure, of two deeds (even though they are formally separated in the procedure) : an investigation (declaratory) <b>deed</b> (<b>administrative),</b> whereby the final deed of the selection procedure of the contractor is finalised, which consists of verifying the best offer; and a private contractual deed, which contains the agreement declaration of the public administration with regard to the contract to be stipulated. I focused in particular on the normative grounds of this theory (in particular, on the principle of equivalence of the record of the adjudication for the contract sanctioned by art. 16, paragraph 4, of the R. D. no. 2440 / 1923 and on the scope of this provision); and thereby making use of the specifications provided by the case law over time and the contributions made by legal theory. I subsequently analysed the concept of the tender procedure solely in terms of an administrative act, sustained by a minor part of the legal theory and case law, but which was endorsed by the Italian Supervisory Authority for Public Works with the decision dated 2 October 2002, no. 24, as it stands it is based on an unconvincing interpretation of the regulations regarding public works and those which provide for the non-conclusive nature of the tender procedure. With regard to the problem in question, I was also able to observe how the new Public Contracts Law, approved with the Italian Legislative Decree 12 April 2006, no. 163, does not contribute towards clarifying the point. If in truth on the one hand, this appears to sanction the overcoming of the traditional planning, according to which the record of the adjudication is equivalent to the contract, expressly asserting, in art. 11, paragraph 7, that “the tender procedure is not equivalent to the acceptance of the offer,” on the other hand, the new law reproduces – in art. 11, paragraph 9 – provision (art. 109, paragraph 3, of the D. P. R. no. 554 / 99), which seems instead allow an interpretation to the contrary and therefore to confirm the traditional planning, according to which the record of the adjudication takes the place of the contract. As regards the results achieved at the end of the survey on the nature of the tender procedure, from this point of view I decided that the conclusions should be shared. This is where that case study orientation came from, which constitutes the specification of the traditional theory of the dual nature of the tender procedure. This differentiates from the deed of adjudication in terms of content in relation to the type of procedure followed and, in particular, excludes the contractual value of the tender procedure (and therefore sustains the need to proceed to a separate, subsequent stipulation) if the proceedings of the private negotiation and the competitive tender have been followed. After having examined the essential character and nature of the tender procedure, I focused on the specific topic of the doctorate thesis (the effects of cancelling the tender procedure on the stipulated mid-term contract), moving from a (critical) analysis of the main guidelines of civil case law and legal theory recorded on the topic. From this point of view, I examined, first of all, the traditional and oldest guidelines of ordinary civil law, which asserts that the contract stipulated on the basis on an unlawful tender procedure can be cancelled in accordance with art. 1441 of the Italian Civil Code (hereafter c. c.). It is believed that this retractability can only and exclusively be asserted by the public administration, the only body that can legitimately carry out the relative act in conformity to the cited art. 1441 c. c [...] From this perspective, I dedicated particular attention to the different reconstructive hypotheses that were elaborated regarding the theory of retractability concerning the contract (retractability due to the public administration’s inability negotiate, former art. 1425, first paragraph of the c. c.; retractability due to errors the agreement, former art. 1427 and foll. of the c. c.; retractability due to the public administration’s error in contractual validation). I then went on to examine the theory, also strongly represented in legal theory and foll. and case law, which brings back the condition of the tender contract stipulated based on a tender procedure cancelled in a judicial capacity with hypothetical absolute nullity, in accordance with art. 1418 of the c. c., concentrating especially on the theory of structural nullity due to a lack of agreement former art. 1418, paragraph 2, and 1325, no. 1, of the c. c. and on the nullity theory due to the violation of binding regulations former art. 1418, first paragraph of the c. c [...] After having examined the different positions taken in the civil sphere, I devoted my attention to studying the “giuspubblicistica” position on the relationship between cancellation and contract, also through the (critical) analysis of the most significant case law rulings on the topic. I paid special attention to the theory of the automatic null and void agreement, which asserts the inefficiency of the contract following the cancellation of the tender procedure on the presupposition of the existence of a link of necessary consequentiality between the public representation procedural sequence and the (subsequent) stipulation of the contract and the relative inefficiency that has occurred, according to which the inefficiency of the contract would not be produced automatically, but following the judicial initiative of the omitted contractor and notwithstanding the rights acquired by bona fide third parties, in application of art. 23, paragraph 2, and 25, paragraph 2 of the c. c [...] At the end of the close examination I analysed the advantages and limitation of the various reconstructions proposed, with special attention paid to the criticisms directed at these theories. With particular regard to the traditional theory of the retractability of the contract, I pointed out that on the one hand – reserving the validation to request the cancellation of the contract to the only subcontracting organisation – it seems to adequately satisfy the needs of certainty of the judicial relations, on the other hand this concept does not appear to guarantee the third party in the same way, which has obtained the cancellation of the contract documents, nullifying in such a way the protection achieved by the latter in an administrative judicial capacity. I also ascertained how the theory of retractability appears to be inspired by an ‘artificial’ distinction between the administrative selection stage of the contractor and the strictly contractual period of the issue (which is clarified when stipulating the contract). Indeed, as I was able to notice in specifically examining the problem of the nature of the tender procedure, it cannot be the case that the two stages cannot always be clearly separated, having considered that the tender procedure in some cases could also be regarded as a declaration of contractual agreement by the public administration as regards the contract to be stipulated and the subject with which to conclude the contract. For this reason it seems difficult to sustain that the cancellation of the tender procedure cannot ever weigh upon the efficiency of the negotiation, and that is to say regardless of an explicit ruling of cancellation of the contract by the ordinary court, as the supporters of the theory of retractability believe. As regards the theory of nullity of the contract, I pointed out how this has been criticised above all as the actual result of an original fault in the contract (which characterises the scheme of radical invalidity) is attributed to an event that has taken place (the cancellation of the tender procedure), with unacceptable consequences (on the level of certainty of the judicial relations), such as the exposure of the same contract to the verification of its office nullity, with any prescriptive limitations and by anyone concerned with them. Finally, as regards the recent reconstructions of administrative case law, substantially referring to the inefficiency of the contract, I was able to indicate how the same, although the interests in play have the merit of completely assessing, giving the right importance to protecting the rights of bona fide third parties, lead to results which are partly reassuring concerning the compatibility of this kind of reconstruction with the system coordinates. In conclusion, I was able to ascertain the deficiency of the various theories examined in explaining the problem of the effects of cancelling the tender procedure on the contract. This inadequacy seems to come mainly from the lack of consideration – by these theories – of the problem of the (procedural and/or contractual) nature of the tender procedure itself and the relations between the tender procedure and contract. I therefore attempted to identify a prospective solution suitable for resolving the problem of the relationship between the invalidity of the public tenders procedure and contract in light of the close examination of the various theories shown by the legal theory and case law (retractability; nullity; automatic null and void agreement; the relative inefficiency that has occurred), reaching a range of conclusions according to the legal, contractual or only procedural description, which we would like to attribute to the deed of adjudication. From this point of view I hypothesised that when the deed of adjudication also takes on contractual worth, the cancellation of the tender procedure causes the nullity of the stipulated mid-term contract, without the need for constitutive statements of its ceased effect, whereas in the cases in which the tender procedure, subject to cancellation, only holds procedural value, the contract must only be deemed as retractable. The combination of the surveys described so far lead to the drafting of three chapters of the doctorate thesis. The first of which is dedicated to the problem of the nature of the tender procedure. The second chapter concentrates on the analysis of the positions of the civil case law and legal theory as to the types of the stipulated mid-term contract. The third chapter focuses on the analysis of the theories of administrative case law and the identification of a prospective solution to the problem...|$|R
