Adding to this diversity are the many and varied settings in which {{residents and}} fellows have the opportunity to train, including Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center and Baylor's many affiliated hospitals.|$|E

2500|$|The medical {{treatment}} of essential tremor at the Movement Disorders Clinic <b>at</b> <b>Baylor</b> <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Medicine begins with minimizing stress and tremorgenic drugs along with recommending a restricted intake of beverages containing caffeine as a precaution, although caffeine {{has not been}} shown to significantly intensify the presentation of essential tremor. [...] Alcohol amounting to a blood concentration of only 0.3% {{has been shown to}} reduce the amplitude of essential tremor in two-thirds of patients; for this reason it may be used as a prophylactic treatment before events during which one would be embarrassed by the tremor presenting itself. [...] Using alcohol regularly and/or in excess to treat tremors is highly unadvisable, as there is a purported correlation between tremor and alcoholism. [...] Alcohol is thought to stabilize neuronal membranes via potentiation of GABA receptor-mediated chloride influx. [...] It has been demonstrated in essential tremor animal models that the food additive 1-octanol suppresses tremors induced by harmaline, and decreases the amplitude of essential tremor for about 90 minutes.|$|E
