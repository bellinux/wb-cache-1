40|$|Click {{prediction}} {{is one of}} the fundamental problems in sponsored search. Most of existing studies took ad-vantage of machine learning approaches to predict ad click for each event of <b>ad</b> <b>view</b> independently. However, as observed in the real-world sponsored search system, user’s behaviors on ads yield high dependency on how the user behaved along with the past time, especially in terms of what queries she submitted, what ads she clicked or ignored, and how long she spent on the land-ing pages of clicked ads, etc. Inspired by these observa-tions, we introduce a novel framework based on Recur-rent Neural Networks (RNN). Compared to traditional methods, this framework directly models the depen-dency on user’s sequential behaviors into the click pre-diction process through the recurrent structure in RNN. Large scale evaluations on the click-through logs from a commercial search engine demonstrate that our ap-proach can significantly improve the click prediction ac-curacy, compared to sequence-independent approaches...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{biochemical}} aids {{to enhance}} athletic performance {{has a long}} history. In our current sporting culture we attempt to divide these between the accepted legal ‘ergogenic aids ’ and the unacceptable performance-enhancing ‘drugs’. It is unclear whether this distinction would have been made 2000 years ago when Pliny the Elder reported the effects of Horsetail juice on performance. Interestingly, the sporting ergogenic effects of horsetail haven’t passed the test of time. In the middle ages its astringency, due to its high silica content, made it ideal for scouring pewter and wooden kitchen utensils. The juice’s current ergogenic properties are more refi ned, its main use being in bath and shower products where a ‘natural conditioning effect ’ is required. Perhaps more controversially, hidden amongst his 600 books, Claudius Galen, the 2 nd century Greek physician to the gladiators, mentioned {{the positive effects of}} eating herbs, mushrooms and testicles. Galen believed that the right testicle was hotter and purer than the left, though whether this led to differential performance-enhancing effects was not rigorously tested. We shouldn’t think that modern people are unusual in being obsessed with winning at all costs. Philostratos’s (200 <b>AD)</b> <b>view</b> of the Ancient Greeks was that “They made war training for sport and sport training for war. ” He was less impressed with his generation of sportsmen who “spent too much time eating, drinking and fornicating instead of actually training”. This was refl ected in their poor choice of ergogenic aids. Although the ancient Spartan athletes trained on a meat-full diet of bulls, oxen, goats and deer, athletes of his generation ate white bread, poppy seeds, fi sh and pork [1].

40|$|Display {{advertising}} {{is an important}} online advertising type where banner advertisements (shortly ad) on websites are usually measured by how many times they are viewed by online users. There are two major channels to sell ad views. They can be auctioned off in real time or be directly sold through guaranteed contracts in advance. The former {{is also known as}} real-time bidding (RTB), in which media buyers come to a common marketplace to compete for a single <b>ad</b> <b>view</b> and this inventory will be allocated to a buyer in milliseconds by an auction model. Unlike RTB, buying and selling guaranteed contracts are not usually programmatic but through private negotiations as advertisers would like to customise their requests and purchase ad views in bulk. In this paper, we propose a simple model that facilitates the automation of direct sales. In our model, a media seller puts future ad views on sale and receives buy requests sequentially over time until the future delivery period. The seller maintains a hidden yet dynamically changing reserve price in order to decide whether to accept a buy request or not. The future supply and demand are assumed to be well estimated and static, and the model's revenue management is using inventory control theory where each computed reverse price is based on the updated supply and demand, and the unsold future ad views will be auctioned off in RTB to the meet the unfulfilled demand. The model has several desirable properties. First, it {{is not limited to the}} demand arrival assumption. Second, it will not affect the current equilibrium between RTB and direct sales as there are no posted guaranteed prices. Third, the model uses the expected revenue from RTB as a lower bound for inventory control and we show that a publisher can receive expected total revenue greater than or equal to those from only RTB if she uses the computed dynamic reserves prices for direct sales.

40|$|Despite the {{enormous}} commercial importance of on-line advertisements (ads), {{there has been}} little work done to clarify the basis for ranking and displaying them. Most existing methods rank ads as if the user views each of them in isolation. We will consider a more realistic user model that induces three mutual influences between displayed ads: (i) positional bias (for <b>viewing</b> <b>ads</b> placed higher up) (ii) similar ad fatigue (which reduces interest in an ad when similar ads have already been displayed above it) and (iii) browsing impatience (which accounts for the user abandoning the <b>ad</b> <b>viewing</b> based on the ads already seen). We will show that in general, when the inter-ad similarity is taken into account, optimal ranking is NP-hard. Ignoring inter-ad similarity, we state and prove the optimal ranking function for sorting the ads that is sensitive to the other two factors. We will show that the known ad ranking strategies correspond to restricted special cases of our ranking function.
