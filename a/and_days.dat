5|$|A common {{justification}} for the need for astronomy {{is the need to}} develop an accurate calendar for agricultural reasons. Ancient texts like Hesiod's Works <b>and</b> <b>Days,</b> an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with ecological signs, such as bird migrations to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the Mursi of Ethiopia shows that haphazard astronomy continued until recent times {{in some parts of the}} world. All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify {{characteristics}} and shifts of discussions on the relationship between kindergartens <b>and</b> <b>day</b> nurseries in occupied Japan. To achieve this goal, this study analyzed articles of “Youji no Kyoiku (Early Childhood Care and Education) ”. The result indicated that discussions can be classified into four stages: (1) From 1946 to the mid- 1947, various groups of the society discussed actively about the relationship and unification of kindergartens <b>and</b> <b>day</b> nurseries. (2) From mid- 1947 to 1948, as a result of the enactment of the School Education Law and Child Welfare Act, the ECCE system was divided into two distinct forms of institutions: kindergartens <b>and</b> <b>day</b> nurseries, but it was argued at the same time that educational contents of kindergartens <b>and</b> <b>day</b> nurseries should be similar. (3) In 1949, ministry officials reemphasized fundamental differences between kindergartens <b>and</b> <b>day</b> nurseries. (4) Likewise, after 1950, educators and experts started also look at some differences between kindergartens <b>and</b> <b>day</b> nurseries. In conclusion, this study revealed that debates on the relationship between kindergartens <b>and</b> <b>day</b> nurseries in occupied Japan varied over time and varied depending on the status and influence of social groups involved...|$|R
