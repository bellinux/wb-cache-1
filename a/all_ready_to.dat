25|$|The grand-ducal {{government}} of the Seekreis was dissolved, and Hecker gradually gained reinforcements. But friendly advisers also joined him, pointing out the risks of his undertaking. Hecker, however, was not at <b>all</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> listen to them. On the contrary, he added to violence an absurd defiance, and offered an amnesty to the German princes on condition of their retiring within fourteen days into private life. The troops of Baden and Hesse marched against him, {{under the command of}} General Friedrich von Gagern, and on April 20 they met near Kandern, where, although Gagern was killed, Hecker was completely defeated.|$|E

500|$|The band {{still needed}} a drummer, so they put {{an ad in}} a local newspaper. The ad {{description}} stated that they [...] were a [...] "funk, thrash, metal groove band looking for a drummer." [...] This resulted in David Silveria auditioning for the band. Although at the time Silveria was only fifteen, he was still recruited to the band, filling the percussionist position. L.A.P.D. recorded a demo album consisting of four songs, [...] "James Brown", [...] "Stinging Like a Bee", [...] "Jesus", and [...] "Don't Label Me", which were <b>all</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be sent out to various record labels.|$|E

500|$|Meyer left {{to write}} for The New Show in late 1983, a {{short-lived}} variety series from Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels. He shared an office with writer Jack Handey, whom he credited with giving him comedy advice. Following this, he joined the writing teams at Not Necessarily the News, and Saturday Night Live beginning in 1985. He later called working on SNL an [...] "exhilarating, frustrating, stressful, and indelible experience." [...] Meyer's work was not well regarded among the SNL writers and producers. He said: [...] "My stuff wasn't very popular at Saturday Night. It was regarded as really fringey, {{and a lot of}} times my sketches would get cut. Sometimes they would get cut after dress rehearsal, and I would have the horrible experience of looking out and seeing a painter carefully touching up my set and getting it <b>all</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be smashed to pieces and sent to a landfill in Brooklyn. It was just a mismatch, although I didn't realize it at the time." [...] He left the show in 1987.|$|E
500|$|Although Drymon had a {{significant}} influence on SpongeBob SquarePants, he was not initially offered a role on the series. As a late recruit to Rocko's Modern Life, he had not established much of a relationship with Hillenburg before SpongeBobs conception. Hillenburg first sought out Drymon's storyboard partner, Mark O'Hare - but O'Hare had just created the soon-to-be syndicated comic strip, Citizen Dog, and while he would later join SpongeBob as a writer, lacked {{the time to get}} involved with both projects at the outset. Drymon has said, [...] "I remember Hillenburg's bringing it up to Mark in our office and asking him if he'd be interested in working on it...I was <b>all</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> say yes to the offer, but Steve didn't ask; he just left the room. I was pretty desperate...so I ran into the hall after him and basically begged him for the job. He didn't jump at the chance." [...] Once Hillenburg had given it some thought and decided to bring Drymon on as creative director, the two began meeting at Hillenburg's house multiple times a week to develop the series. Drymon has identified this period as having begun in 1996, shortly after the end of Rocko's Modern Life.|$|E
500|$|Another {{piece of}} work which {{attempted}} to justify the retreat maneuver and to present it as a highly strategic calculation was Berthier's Relation de la bataille de Marengo, published in 1804. Berthier suggests that time had {{to be given to}} Desaix and Boudet's division to occupy their positions: [...] "The enemy general misinterpreted this maneuver and thought the army was in full retreat, while in reality it was only executing a movement of conversion." [...] However, it is known that Desaix's arrival, while definitely expected, was not certain before the retreat. The bulletin explains that Desaix's forces were waiting in reserve with artillery pieces, which in reality was false, because they arrived late in the battle. Several participants to the fighting reveal the precarious condition of the army throughout the day, including Marmont in his Memoirs, Captain Coignet: [...] "We were retreating in good order but <b>all</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> start running at the earliest sign of danger", Captain Gervais: [...] "In this battle, we were many times {{on the verge of being}} defeated. The enemy cavalry, on a terrain favourable to this arm, charged us repeatedly. We were often obliged to concentrate and even to retreat", and General Thévenet: [...] "There is no doubt that a part of the French army was repelled up to the Scrivia".|$|E

2500|$|Hill {{was part}} of the team that {{negotiated}} the Bosnia peace settlement. While working on Balkan issues, Hill worked closely with Richard Holbrooke, serving as his deputy at the Dayton Peace Talks in 1995. Holbrooke described Hill as [...] "brilliant, fearless and argumentative" [...] in his book on the Dayton negotiations and said that Hill manages to be both [...] "very cool and very passionate." [...] The combination, Holbrooke said, enhances Hill's [...] "extremely good negotiating skills." [...] Hill said the negotiations with the Bosnians, Serbs and Croats were successful because all the parties [...] "were <b>all</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> settle.' ...|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Vishnuvardhan {{mentioned}} that he had [...] "twice missed out on the chance to direct him [...] The third time when I {{got a chance to}} direct him, I made sure that I would not miss it. I was <b>all</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> write a good script for him but he said, he wanted me to remake Billa", confirming it was Ajith Kumar's idea. The film was originally announced, provisionally after the release of the Bollywood film, [...] – which was a remake of the yesteryear film with the same name from 1978. Also from the 1978 version of Don, a remake was made in 1980 into Tamil, called Billa. 2007's Billa drew inspirations from these three versions. Suresh Balaji, who had acted in the yesteryear version of Billa, acquired the rights to produce the film. The film became the second Tamil film to be remade from its yesteryear version after Naan Avanillai.|$|E
2500|$|In October, the Giants toured Japan. Landrith {{was looking}} forward to his first trip to the Orient after just missing out on a tour after the 1958 season with the St. Louis Cardinals. He had gotten all of his shots and inoculations, <b>all</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> make the trip to Japan, and just three days before the Cards went to Japan he was traded to the Giants. He was greatly {{disappointed}} that he didn't receive the chance to play against the greats in Japan. [...] "I wanted to make that trip more than anything else." [...] He didn't miss this trip, playing behind the plate for the Giants against all challengers in Japan. To further United States-Japan good will, Landrith and the Giants placed flowers at the Atomic Bomb Memorial Shrine in Hiroshima. After the ceremony, the Giants played the final game of their 16-game tour of Japan, beating the Japanese All-Stars 4 to 1 before a crowd of 12,000. Landrith hit [...]348 for the series.|$|E

The Tribunal {{found that the}} applicant had suffered neither direct nor indirect discrimination under the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003 or the Human Rights Act 1998.

2500|$|His second {{great work}} was the {{commentary}} on the Qur'an, (Arabic Tafsir al-Tabari), which was marked by the same fullness of detail as the Annals. Abul-Qaasim Ibn 'Aqil Al-Warraq [...] (رحمه الله) says: [...] " [...] Imām Ibn Jarir (رحمه الله) once said to his students: “Are you <b>all</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> write down my lesson on the Tafsir (commentary) of the entire Holy Quran?" [...] They enquired as to how lengthy it would be. [...] "30 000 pages"! he replied. They said: [...] "This would {{take a long time}} and cannot be completed in one lifetime. He therefore made it concise and kept it to 3000 pages (note, this was in reference to the old days when they used ink and hard-paper which was a bit long format today). It took him seven years to finish it from the year 283 until 290. It is said [...] that it is the most voluminous Athari Tafsir (i.e., based on hadith not intellect) existent today so well received by the Ummah that it survived to this day intact due to its popularity and widely printed copies available worldwide. Scholars such as Baghawi and Suyuti used it largely. It was used in compiling the Tafsir ibn Kathir which {{is often referred to as}} Mukhtasar Tafsir at-Tabari.|$|E
2500|$|From 1999 onwards, {{a renewed}} process was set into motion by the Tajik Ahmad Shah Massoud and the Pashtun Abdul Haq to unite all the ethnicities of Afghanistan. While Massoud united the Tajiks, Hazara and Uzbeks {{as well as}} some Pashtun {{commander}}s under his United Front command, the famed Pashtun commander Abdul Haq received increasing numbers of defecting Pashtun Taliban as [...] "Taliban popularity trended downward". Both agreed to work together with the exiled Afghan king Zahir Shah. International officials who met with representatives of the new alliance, which Pulitzer Prize winner Steve Coll referred to as the [...] "grand Pashtun-Tajik alliance", said, [...] "It's crazy that you have this today ... Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazara ... They were <b>all</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> buy in to the process ... to work under the king's banner for an ethnically balanced Afghanistan." [...] Senior diplomat and Afghanistan expert Peter Tomsen wrote: [...] "The ‘Lion of Kabul’ [...] and the ‘Lion of Panjshir’ ... Haq, Massoud, and Karzai, Afghanistan’s three leading moderates, could transcend the Pashtun—non-Pashtun, north-south divide." [...] The most senior Hazara and Uzbek leader were also part of the process. In late 2000, Massoud officially brought together this new alliance in a meeting in Northern Afghanistan to discuss, among other things, [...] "a Loya Jirga, or a traditional council of elders, to settle political turmoil in Afghanistan". [...] That part of the Pashtun-Tajik-Hazara-Uzbek peace plan did eventually materialize. An account of the meeting by author and journalist Sebastian Junger says: [...] "In 2000, when I was there ... I happened to be there in a very interesting time. ... Massoud brought together Afghan leaders from all ethnic groups. They flew from London, Paris, the USA, all parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India. He brought them all into the northern area where he was. He held a council of ... prominent Afghans from all over the world, brought there to discuss the Afghan government after the Taliban. ... we met all these men and interviewed them briefly. One was Hamid Karzai; I did not have any idea who he would end up being ..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Barruels third volume {{addresses}} the antisocial conspiracy {{that was the}} objective of the Freemasons and the Order of the Illuminati. The philosophes and their attacks against the church and the throne {{paved the way for the}} conspiracy that was led by these secret societies. These groups were believed to have constituted a single sect that numbered over 300,000 members who were [...] "all zealous for the Revolution, and <b>all</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> rise at the first signal and to impart the shock to all others classes of the people". Barruel surveyed the history of Masonry and maintained that its higher mysteries had always been of an atheist and republican cast. He believed the Freemasons kept their words and aims secret for many years but on August 12, 1792, two days after the fall of the French monarchy, they ran though the streets openly announcing their secrets. The secret words were [...] "Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity" [...] and the secret aim was the overthrow of the French monarchy and the establishment of the republic. Barruel claimed he heard them speak these words in France but that in other countries the Masons still kept their secrets. A division of the group into numerous lodges ensured that if the secrets of one lodge were discovered, the rest would remain hidden. He believed that it was his job to warn all governments and people of the goals of the Freemasons. Barruel described in detail how this system worked in the case of the Illuminati. Even after Johann Adam Weishaupt, the leader of the sect, was discovered and tried in court, the proceedings could not uncover the universal influence of the Illuminati and no steps were taken against the group. The majority of the secret societies could always survive and carry on their activities because of the organization of the group. The Illuminati, as a whole, functioned to radicalize the movement against the throne and altar and influenced more members of the population to subscribe to their hidden principles. They refined the secret structure that had been provided by the Masons basic framework.|$|E
