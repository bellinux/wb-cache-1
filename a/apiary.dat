5|$|The <b>Apiary</b> Laboratory, {{more often}} {{referred}} to as the <b>Apiary,</b> is a research laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Originally built for the study of honey bees and apiculture, today it is primarily used to study native pollinator species and the chemicals and pathogens impacting their populations. This academic building is unique in that it is credited as being the first in the United States to be erected exclusively for the teaching of beekeeping.|$|E
5|$|The {{department}} of entomology has done several studies in apiculture, chemical ecology, horticultural pollination, and the behavior of honeybee and bumblebee colonies. Although some research {{was done in the}} <b>apiary</b> yards, the majority of data had to be collected with higher numbers of colonies at different experimental stations.|$|E
25|$|Hornets at the <b>apiary</b> are {{captured}} and fed a sugar solution or bee {{that has been}} poisoned with malathion. The toxin is expected to spread through trophallaxis. This method is good in principle, but has not been tested extensively.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} six bee viruses {{on a large}} {{geographic}} scale was undertaken by using seemingly healthy bee colonies and the PCR technique.

In adult bees, during the year deformed wing virus (DWV) was found at least once in 97 % of the <b>apiaries,</b> sacbrood virus (SBV) was found in 86 % of the <b>apiaries,</b> chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) was found in 28 % of the <b>apiaries,</b> acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) was found in 58 % of the <b>apiaries,</b> black queen cell virus (BQCV) was found in 86 % of the <b>apiaries,</b> and Kashmir bee virus (KBV) was found in 17 % of the <b>apiaries.</b> For pupae, the following frequencies were obtained: DWV, 94 % of the apiaries; SBV, 80 % of the apiaries; CBPV, none of the apiaries; ABPV, 23 % of the apiaries; BQCV, 23 % of the apiaries; and KBV, 6 % of the <b>apiaries.</b> In Varroa samples, the following four viruses were identified: DWV (100 % of the <b>apiaries),</b> SBV (45 % of the <b>apiaries),</b> ABPV (36 % of the <b>apiaries),</b> and KBV (5 % of the <b>apiaries).</b> The latter findings support the putative role of mites in transmitting these viruses. Taken together, these data indicate that bee virus infections occur persistently in bee populations despite the lack of clinical signs, suggesting that colony disease outbreaks might result from environmental factors that lead to activation of viral replication in bees...|$|R

50|$|For pollination, <b>apiaries</b> {{are rarely}} set up; the bees are only present during the bloom {{period of the}} crop.

25|$|Beekeepers may harvest honey from July until October, {{according}} to the honey flows in their area. Good management requires keeping the hive free of pests and disease, and ensuring that the bee colony has room in the hive to expand. Chemical treatments, if used for parasite control, must {{be done in the}} off-season to avoid any honey contamination. Exterminators therefore often offer bee-safe and honey-safe treatment methods targeted towards beekeepers. Success for the hobbyist also depends on locating the <b>apiary</b> so bees have a good nectar source and pollen source throughout the year.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless, {{the oldest}} archaeological find {{relating}} to beekeeping discovered {{to date is}} an <b>apiary</b> dating from about 900 BC at Rehov, a Bronze- and Iron Age site in the Jordan Valley. The hives, made of straw and unbaked clay, could have housed {{more than a million}} bees, and indicate that honey was produced on a large scale. It is most likely that the inhabitants of Tel Rehov imported the bees from Anatolia because they were less aggressive than the local bees and produced a higher yield of honey. It is also possible that the domestication of bees for honey production was introduced from Egypt during the Iron Age and honey was being obtained from domesticated bees from late in the Iron Age period.|$|E
25|$|The Africanized {{honey bees}} in the Western Hemisphere are descended from hives {{operated}} by biologist Warwick E. Kerr, who had interbred honey bees from Europe and southern Africa. Kerr {{was attempting to}} breed a strain of bees that would produce more honey and be better adapted to tropical conditions (i.e., more productive) than the European strain of honey bee currently in use throughout North, Central and South America. The hives containing this particular Africanized subspecies, were housed at an <b>apiary</b> near Rio Claro, São Paulo, in the southeast of Brazil and were noted to be especially defensive. These hives had been fitted with special excluder screens (called queen excluders) to prevent the larger queen bees and drones from getting out and mating with the local population of European bees. According to Kerr, in October 1957 a visiting beekeeper, noticing that the queen excluders were interfering with the worker bees' movement, removed them resulting in the accidental release of 26 Tanganyikan swarms of A. m. scutellata. Following this accidental release, the Africanized swarms spread out and cross-bred with local European colonies; their descendants have since spread throughout the Americas. Because their movement through South and Central America was rapid and largely unassisted by humans, Africanized bees have earned {{the reputation of being}} {{one of the most successful}} biologically invasive species of all time.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} amount of the farm land is set aside for student plots. Part of practical agriculture lessons involves students growing and maintaining their own crops, and a practical mark worth 10% of their yearly mark is awarded {{at the end of}} term. Mature crops in the students' assigned plots of land are then the students' to take home. In addition to its use for educational purposes, the farm also supplies a wide variety of agricultural produce including: Cattle - Angus stud, paraded annually at the Castle Hill Show by the Cattle Group, and sold at Camden Sales yard; Sheep - First-cross Ewes & Prime Lambs; Eggs - Free-range eggs; Poultry Meat - Broilers raised and sold onsite, Oranges - Washington Navel; Peaches - Flordagold and Sherman's Red varieties; Sweet Corn - Shimmer variety; James Ruse Gold Rose - A privately crossbred rose variety the rights were donated to the school in 1999 in celebration of its 40 years of teaching; <b>Apiary</b> - Honey sold on-site in jars; and Macadamia Nuts. Various groups of students have been set up to look after these, such as the Poultry Squad and a Weather Watcher group to maintain farm records. In the past, the farm also housed Merino and Border Leicester sheep, named the Sharlea Sheep. It was replaced by the Aquaculture venture, silver perch and a crayfish growing system. Now some students also participate in making peach jam and sorbet after the peach harvest.|$|E

40|$|Varroadestructor is an {{invasive}} {{alien species}} that has been reported parasitizing the endemic honey bee of Madagascar, Apis mellifera unicolor, since 2010. Studying its nuclear genetic diversity and structure was our main goal. Using 11 microsatellite loci and 344 mites collected from 12 <b>apiaries,</b> we observed a low genetic diversity, with only 8 multilocus genotypes (MLG) identified. V. destructor populations form a single genetic cluster, clonal richness ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 20, and number of MLG within <b>apiaries</b> varied between one and six MLGs. About 69. 5 % of the mites analyzed harbored the same genotype (100 %, homozygous), and 23. 3 % had a genotype differing by a single allele. The overall low diversity observed suggests one or multiple introductions of similar genotypes. The greater abundance of MLGs in High Land <b>apiaries</b> (eight MLGs) than {{on the east coast}} (two MLGs) and the presence of particular MLGs in High Land <b>apiaries</b> favor the hypothesis that V. destructor has been first introduced close to the international airport, and then spread to other regions by commercial exchanges.

When commercial <b>apiaries</b> are moved into areas occupied by black bears (Ursus americanus), conflicts between beekeepers and bears sometimes occur. Commercial pollination often involves moving <b>apiaries</b> among agricultural fields, and, thus, permanent fencing is not a viable option for reducing damage by bears. In 2010, we tested the effectiveness of 4 temporary electric fence designs for excluding black bears from bait sites in northern Michigan.

Newly mated honey bee (Apis mellifera carnica) queens were collected from mating nuclei in queen rearing operations in Slovenia. Altogether, 81 queens were sampled from 27 rearing <b>apiaries</b> in 2006 and 72 queens from 24 <b>apiaries</b> in 2008. Queens were analysed for the presence of four viruses: acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), sacbrood virus (SBV) and deformed wing virus (DWV) by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In 2006, 12 %, 9 % and 1 % prevalence was found for ABPV, DWV and SBV, respectivelyBQCV was not detected. Two years later, DWV, BQCV, SBV and ABPV were detected in 58 %, 24 %, 11 % and 10 % bee queens, respectively. In 2006, fourteen out of twenty-seven apaiaries were virus free, whereas in 2008 only three out of twenty-four <b>apiaries</b> were virus free. This is the first evidence of virus infection occurring in newly mated queens from mating nuclei in rearing <b>apiaries.</b> The possible impacts of queen rearing technology and epidemiological influences on virus infection are discussed in this study...|$|R

500|$|As the <b>apiary</b> {{became a}} {{research}} laboratory, classroom and an extension {{service to the}} state, the demand increased for these services and thus it became necessary to maintain additional hives. It is for these reasons that, in 1913, Dr. Gates hired John L. Byard as superintendent of the <b>apiary.</b> Some of Byard's responsibilities included performing wax extractions, running the college's apicultural exhibit at fairs and maintaining the hive yard from day to day. [...] He would continue to maintain the building, the equipment and the hives {{until his death in}} 1920; professors Henry T. Fernald and Arthur I. Bourne would continue his work until his successor arrived the following year. Gates had been promoted from an assistant to an associate professor in 1915, and had continued to work both as a lecturer and as the apiarist of the experimental station. From 1913 to 1914 he was made president of the National Beekeepers' Association, twice hosting conventions in Amherst concluding the college's winter and spring sessions of the college beekeeping school. However, in 1918 he left Amherst for a professorship at the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph, leaving his former position open for the two years that followed. Gates' and Byard's duties would be taken up by several different people in the next decade. From 1921 to 1923 all beekeeping and apiology work at the Experimental Station was taken up by Professor Norman Phillips, who soon resigned for a job at a commercial <b>apiary.</b> He was replaced by Professor Morton H. Cassidy, an alumnus of the college, who stayed for 3 more years but ultimately had to resign due to his severe asthma. In 1926, a Mr. Clayton L. Farrar was made instructor of beekeeping. Farrar, a graduate of Kansas Agricultural College, also performed extensive work on several entomology projects as a research assistant before leaving in 1931 to work at a Federal laboratory.|$|E
