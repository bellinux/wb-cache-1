5|$|Nepenthes rajah {{has a very}} {{localised}} distribution, being {{restricted to}} Mount Kinabalu and neighbouring Mount Tambuyukon, both located in Kinabalu National Park, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Mount Kinabalu is a massive granitic dome structure that is geologically young and formed from the intrusion and uplift of a granitic batholith. At 4095.2m, it {{is by far the}} tallest mountain on the island of Borneo and one of the highest peaks in Southeast Asia. The lower slopes of the mountain <b>are</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> sandstone and shale, transformed from marine sand and mud about 35 million years ago. Intrusive ultramafic (serpentine) rock was uplifted with the core of the batholith and forms a collar around the mountain.

5|$|As of the 2010 Malaysian census, the {{population}} of the town of Bintulu is 114,058. Indigenous people accounted for the largest proportion of the town population (61.2%, 69,782), followed by Chinese (25.0%, 28,512), Non-Malaysians (13.1%, 14,939), and Indians (0.3%, 319). Among the indigenous groups, there are Iban (32,992), Malay (14,945), Melanau (14,179), Bidayuh (1,598), and other indigenous tribes (6,068). According to government sources, there are 229 Iban longhouses in the Bintulu District. The Ibans moved into Kemena and Tatau basins in the mid-19th and early 20th century with permission of the Brooke government. Other indigenous tribes that form the minority are Kayan, Kenyah, and Punan. The Chinese in Bintulu <b>are</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> dialect groups such as Hakka, Fuzhou, and Teochews. The Chinese have been living in the town of Tatau since the era of Bruneian Empire. Later, Fuzhou Chinese from Sibu moved in, dominating the timber and plantation businesses in Bintulu. There is also a large number of foreigners working there. Most of them come from Britain, Australia, the Netherlands, Germany, South Africa, New Zealand, Japan, China, the United States, and Indonesia.|$|E

25|$|Asteroids are {{differentiated}} from comets and meteoroids. In {{the case}} of comets, the difference is one of composition: while asteroids <b>are</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> mineral and rock, comets are composed of dust and ice. In addition, asteroids formed closer to the sun, preventing {{the development of the}} aforementioned cometary ice. The difference between asteroids and meteoroids is mainly one of size: meteoroids have a diameter of less than one meter, whereas asteroids have a diameter of greater than one meter. Finally, meteoroids can be composed of either cometary or asteroidal materials.|$|E

The peacekeepers <b>are</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> military personnel (but to a less number also the police) sent by governments of various member-states. However, over the course of their involvement in the field, peacekeepers have also been accused and at times found guilty of committing rape and other forms of sexual violence to the local population, in particular to women and children. Among all international staff in the conflict zone, United Nations peacekeepers (handled by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations) have been most frequently identified as the perpetrators of rape.|$|E

Coquihalla Mountain, the highest {{summit of the}} Bedded Range with an elevation of , is a major preserved stratovolcano and {{represents one of the}} few remaining Miocene volcanoes in southwestern British Columbia. As a result, the Coquihalla Volcanic Complex has been a subject of geological studies to annunciate the remains of what might have been an extensive cover of volcanic rocks during the early Miocene epoch. The Coquihalla Complex also has a different igneous composition than Canadian Cascade Arc volcanoes that formed in the last two million years. Rhyolite tuffs are the primary igneous rocks comprising the Coquihalla Volcanic Complex, with small amounts of basalt or andesite present. This contrasts with modern Canadian Cascade volcanoes in that they <b>are</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> volcanic rocks in the basalt to andesite composition range, with few rocks of more felsic composition than dacite.
