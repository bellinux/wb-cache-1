40|$|Three benzene metabolites, {{hydroquinone}} (HQ), cathecol (<b>CAT)</b> <b>and</b> phenol (PHE) {{were studied}} {{to define their}} possible interaction in inducing micronuclei (Mn) in mouse bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs). HQ <b>and</b> <b>CAT,</b> administered separately, induced Mn while PHE showed no genotoxic effects. Binary and ternary mixtures {{of two or three}} metabolites gave different results, causing considerable increase or decrease in Mn induction. HQ and PHE, in binary mixtures, as well as PHE <b>and</b> <b>CAT,</b> increased Mn synergistically, while HQ <b>and</b> <b>CAT</b> interacted negatively. The genotoxicity of ternary mixtures was mainly the consequence of two metabolites: HQ <b>and</b> <b>CAT.</b> The maximal effect obtained is far below the induction of Mn consequent to benzene treament. These data suggest that toxic and genotoxic effects of benzene alone could be the result of more complex interactions among these and other metabolites...|$|R

5|$|Life in {{proximity}} to humans and other domestic animals {{has led to}} a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, <b>and</b> <b>cats</b> may express great affection toward humans or other animals. Ethologically, the human keeper of a cat may function as a sort of surrogate for the cat's mother, and adult housecats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. The high-pitched sounds housecats make to solicit food may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly hard for humans to ignore.|$|E
