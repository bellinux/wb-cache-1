5|$|<b>Ancient</b> <b>Egyptian</b> deities are {{the gods}} and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt. The beliefs and rituals {{surrounding}} these gods formed the core of <b>ancient</b> <b>Egyptian</b> religion, which emerged sometime in prehistory. Deities represented natural forces and phenomena, and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to maat, or divine order. After {{the founding of the}} Egyptian state around 3100BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, who claimed to be the gods' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Ancient</b> <b>Egyptians</b> {{were the}} neighbors of the Berbers.

The Egyptian-Berber gods and goddesses can be distinguished according to their origin.|$|R

5|$|<b>Ancient</b> <b>Egyptian</b> {{literature}} has been preserved {{on a wide}} variety of media. This includes papyrus scrolls and packets, limestone or ceramic ostraca, wooden writing boards, monumental stone edifices and coffins. Texts preserved and unearthed by modern archaeologists represent a small fraction of <b>ancient</b> <b>Egyptian</b> literary material. The area of the floodplain of the Nile is under-represented because the moist environment is unsuitable for the preservation of papyri and ink inscriptions. On the other hand, hidden caches of literature, buried for thousands of years, have been discovered in settlements on the dry desert margins of Egyptian civilization.|$|E

5|$|Hieratic {{was used}} {{alongside}} hieroglyphs for writing in Old and Middle Egyptian, becoming the dominant form of writing in Late Egyptian. By the New Kingdom {{and throughout the}} rest of <b>ancient</b> <b>Egyptian</b> history, Middle Egyptian became a classical language that was usually reserved for reading and writing in hieroglyphs. For the rest of <b>ancient</b> <b>Egyptian</b> history, Middle Egyptian remained the spoken language for more exalted forms of literature, such as historical records, commemorative autobiographies, hymns, and funerary spells. However, Middle Kingdom literature written in Middle Egyptian was also rewritten in hieratic during later periods.|$|E

5|$|Parts of {{the myth}} appear {{in a wide variety}} of Egyptian texts, from funerary texts and magical spells to short stories. The story is, therefore, more {{detailed}} and more cohesive than any other <b>ancient</b> <b>Egyptian</b> myth. Yet no Egyptian source gives a full account {{of the myth}}, and the sources vary widely in their versions of events. Greek and Roman writings, particularly De Iside et Osiride by Plutarch, provide more information but may not always accurately reflect Egyptian beliefs. Through these writings, the Osiris myth persisted after knowledge of most <b>ancient</b> <b>Egyptian</b> beliefs was lost, and it is still well known today.|$|E

5|$|In antiquity, {{symbolism}} involving sheep {{cropped up}} in religions {{in the ancient}} Near East, the Mideast, and the Mediterranean area: Çatalhöyük, <b>ancient</b> <b>Egyptian</b> religion, the Cana'anite and Phoenician tradition, Judaism, Greek religion, and others. Religious symbolism and ritual involving sheep began {{with some of the}} first known faiths: Skulls of rams (along with bulls) occupied central placement in shrines at the Çatalhöyük settlement in 8,000 BCE. In <b>Ancient</b> <b>Egyptian</b> religion, the ram was the symbol of several gods: Khnum, Heryshaf and Amun (in his incarnation as a god of fertility). Other deities occasionally shown with ram features include the goddess Ishtar, the Phoenician god Baal-Hamon, and the Babylonian god Ea-Oannes. In Madagascar, sheep were not eaten as they were believed to be incarnations of the souls of ancestors.|$|E
