5|$|Born the {{daughter}} of a commoner—Edward Hyde (later created Earl of Clarendon)—Anne is best known for her marriage to James, which caused much gossip. Two months after the marriage, Anne gave birth to the couple's first child, who had obviously been conceived out of wedlock. Until near the end of Anne's life, some observers disapproved of James' decision to marry Anne, but not King Charles II, James' brother, who wanted the marriage to take place. Another cause of disapproval was the public affection James showed toward Anne, such as kissing <b>and</b> <b>leaning</b> against each other, which was considered improper behaviour from man to wife during the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|In 1556, amid great pomp, <b>and</b> <b>leaning</b> on the {{shoulder}} of one of his favorites (the 24-year-old William, Count of Nassau and Orange), Charles gave away his lands and his offices. The Spanish empire, which included Spain, the Netherlands, Naples, Milan and Spain's possessions in the Americas, went to his son, Philip. His brother, Ferdinand, who had negotiated the treaty in the previous year, was already in possession of the Austrian lands and was also the obvious candidate to succeed Charles as Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E
5|$|St Andrew's Church {{dates from}} the 12th century with a large 15th century pinnacled {{sandstone}} tower, a Norman font and a rood screen that is the full width of the church. In the church are several memorials to the Stracheys of Sutton Court together with a wooden effigy of a Knight cross-legged <b>and</b> <b>leaning</b> on one elbow, in 15th century armour, thought to be of Sir John de Hauteville or a descendant, and possibly transferred from a church at Norton Hautville before it was demolished.|$|E
25|$|The {{book had}} a mixed reception. While lauded by some pro-Jewish <b>and</b> right <b>leaning</b> publications, {{it was also}} sharply criticized by pro-Palestinian <b>and</b> liberal <b>leaning</b> publications.|$|R
5000|$|Ziad al-Doulatli, {{spokesman}} for the Tunisian Ennahda Movement, an Islamist group, voiced criticism of Ben Achour {{saying that he was}} [...] "known for his Francophone <b>and</b> secular <b>leanings</b> <b>and</b> his hostility towards religion." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing <b>and</b> <b>leaning</b> {{on a table}} in an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceiling of}} the Sistine Chapel {{was to have a}} {{profound}} effect upon other artists, even before it was completed. Vasari, in his Life of Raphael, tells us that Bramante, who had the keys to the chapel, let Raphael in to examine the paintings in Michelangelo's absence. On seeing Michelangelo's prophets, Raphael went back to the picture of the Prophet Isaiah that he was painting on a column in the Church of Sant'Agostino and, according to Vasari, although it was finished, he scraped it off the wall and repainted it in a much more powerful manner, in imitation of Michelangelo. John O'Malley points out that even earlier than the Isaiah is Raphael's inclusion of the figure of Heraclitus in the School of Athens, a brooding figure similar to Michelangelo's Jeremiah, but with the countenace of Michelangelo himself, <b>and</b> <b>leaning</b> on a block of marble.|$|E
5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs <b>and</b> <b>leaning</b> against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|E
50|$|Norfolk was {{the second}} cousin of Queen Elizabeth I through her {{maternal}} grandmother, Lady Elizabeth Howard, and he was trusted with public office despite his family's history <b>and</b> <b>leanings</b> towards Catholicism (although he was brought up a Protestant). He commissioned Thomas Tallis, probably in 1567, to compose his renowned motet in forty voice-parts Spem in alium.|$|R

25|$|After winning two minor bouts in Germany and enlisting the {{services}} of legendary boxing trainer Emanuel Steward, Klitschko again fought for the vacated WBO title on 10 April 2004, in Las Vegas, against Lamon Brewster. Klitschko sent Brewster to the canvas in the fourth round; however, things turned around in the fifth when Brewster's punches began backing him up. Not defending himself <b>and</b> <b>leaning</b> into ropes for support, Klitschko took a standing eight count. On unsteady legs, Klitschko fell to the canvas after the bell and the referee stopped the fight for his safety.|$|E
25|$|Poor {{pedestrian}} and boundary structures. The cemetery's flagstone plazas {{and sidewalks}} were crumbling due to overuse, {{and the red}} Seneca sandstone boundary wall (built in the late 1800s) around the cemetery was showing signs of severe weathering and collapse. In sections 27 and 50, earth on the Fort Myer side of the boundary walls was filled up against the wall. This forced the boundary walls in these areas {{to serve as a}} retaining wall. Since the boundary wall was not designed for this function, the wall in these sections were cracked <b>and</b> <b>leaning,</b> and some areas in danger of collapsing completely.|$|E
25|$|Portrait of Dr. Gachet {{is one of}} {{the most}} revered {{paintings}} by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. It depicts Dr. Paul Gachet who took care of Van Gogh during the final months of his life. There are two authenticated versions of the portrait, both painted in June 1890 at Auvers-sur-Oise. Both show Gachet sitting at a table <b>and</b> <b>leaning</b> his head on his right arm but they are easily differentiated in color and style. In 1990, the first version fetched a record price of $82.5 million ($75 million, plus a 10 percent buyer's commission) when sold at auction in New York.|$|E

50|$|John Drennan (real name Sean Armstrong) is an Irish {{political}} {{journalist and}} writer. He {{is a columnist}} for the Sunday Independent, an occasional TV panelist and a frequent contributor to radio shows. From County Laois he was educated at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth where he studied for an arts degree and worked as a part-time postman to fund his shooting and fishing hobbies. A gun enthusiast and writer of dole diaries, he doesn't hide his Fine Gael background <b>and</b> <b>leanings,</b> <b>and</b> the Leeksman often refers to himself warmly as an Old Blueshirt.|$|R
50|$|The film's {{focus on}} the {{exploitation}} of coal miners was likely influenced by Teshigahara <b>and</b> Abe's political <b>leanings,</b> <b>and</b> their sympathy with the Tokyo demonstrations in 1960 against Anpo.|$|R
25|$|Grissom and {{his team}} found the washed-up rock star dead in his kitchen in the episode Built to Kill, Part 2. His body was sprawled in a chair <b>and</b> <b>leaning</b> {{forwards}} onto the table. They determined {{that the cause of}} death was a single blow delivered to the back of a head with a rolling pin. The first miniature was found close by. It was a perfect diorama of the kitchen, and even included objects in the garbage and placement of Delancy's blood. In the model they also found a picture of a bloodied doll, hidden behind a mini photo frame, and a bleach container in the miniature garbage.|$|E
25|$|The head tracker {{registers}} {{the translation}} and {{rotation of the}} user's head. Pointman uses these inputs to map {{the movements of the}} user's head and torso one-for-one to those of his avatar. The virtual view changes as the user turns his head to look around or leans his torso in any direction. When the weapon is raised into an aim position its sights remain centered in the field of view, so that turning the head also adjusts the aim. The user can aim as precisely as he can hold his head on target. Hunching the head down by flexing the spine is also registered by the head's translation, and the avatar adopts a matching posture. Leaning forward and hunching are used to duck behind cover. Rising up <b>and</b> <b>leaning</b> to the side are used to look out and shoot from behind cover.|$|E
25|$|Footage of Atkins and Jones in {{the vehicle}} with Nesbitt were {{captured}} on the ATM's CCTV camera, which was {{of the two men}} with Nesbitt in the middle <b>and</b> <b>leaning</b> across Jones to withdraw money, and further forensic evidence implicating the two were found in Nesbitt's abandoned vehicle. The two suspects were quickly tracked down and arrested. In custody, each man claimed that the other had pulled the trigger. Atkins's version of the events, however, was found to contain a number of inconsistencies. Doubts concerning Atkins's testimony were strengthened when a cell-mate claimed that Atkins had confessed to him that he had shot Nesbitt. A deal of life imprisonment was negotiated with Jones in return for his full testimony against Atkins. The jury decided that Jones's version of events was the more coherent and credible, and convicted Atkins of capital murder.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} of the Repco engine and the Brabham BT19 chassis designed by Tauranac worked. At the French Grand Prix at Reims-Gueux, Jack Brabham took his first Formula One world championship win since 1960 {{and became the first}} man to win such a race in a car of his own construction. Only his two former teammates, Bruce McLaren and Dan Gurney, have since matched this achievement. It was the first in a run of four straight wins for the Australian veteran. The 40-year-old Brabham was annoyed by press stories about his age and, in a highly uncharacteristic stunt, at the Dutch Grand Prix he hobbled to his car on the starting grid before the race wearing a long false beard <b>and</b> <b>leaning</b> on a cane before going on to win the race. Brabham confirmed his third championship at the Italian Grand Prix and became the only driver to win the Formula One World Championship in a car that carried his own name.|$|E
500|$|When the old CBOT {{building}} was demolished in 1929, two [...] tall gray granite statues of classically styled goddesses (pictured right) were {{moved from the}} second floor ledge above the main entrance into the gardens of the 500 acre (2km²) estate of Arthur W. Cutten, a wheat and cotton speculator who went bankrupt during the Great Depression. One goddess represents agriculture and is shown standing with wheat <b>and</b> <b>leaning</b> on a cornucopia. The other represents industry and appears with the bow of a ship and an anvil.|$|E
500|$|According to Price, Insomniac {{wanted to}} [...] "break {{the rules of}} shooters". He felt that the last {{generation}} of shooters had established a formula of staying behind cover for defense, <b>and</b> <b>leaning</b> out from it to attack. He wanted to change that pattern with Sunset Overdrive by encouraging players to attack in an aggressive manner and to focus on momentum. To accomplish this, the team developed a city that supported parkour and fast movements. They also hoped that {{with the introduction of}} a new generation of video game consoles, they could establish a new standard for the genre which would [...] "retrain" [...] shooter fans playing the game.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1990s, {{proposals}} {{were made in}} Congress to extinguish all further efforts by unrecognized tribes to gain recognition. These were defeated. Success or continued failure tends to drift with the national mood <b>and</b> <b>leanings</b> of Congress. [...] Effectively, recognition turns upon the mood of Congress with respect to honoring treaties with Native Americans. Occasionally tribes succeed, such as with the Boldt Decision in 1974.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Hungerford, Berkshire, England in 1917, Beadle studied cabinetmaking and {{building}} construction at Cambridge Art School {{for two years}} before going on to London Country Council Central School of Arts and Crafts. [...] He also studied privately under sculptor and carver Alfred Southwick. He went on to Copenhagen to study in the studio of Kurt Harald Eisenstein, where his classicist style <b>and</b> <b>leanings</b> began to develop.|$|R

500|$|Anne {{experienced}} {{problems in}} her married life. She {{was not very}} much liked at court and James philandered with younger mistresses such as Arabella Churchill, with whom he fathered many illegitimate children, including two born during Anne's lifetime; thus he was called [...] "the most unguarded ogler of his time." [...] Anne was not oblivious to this: Pepys wrote that she was jealous and chided James, but he also wrote that Anne and James were notorious for showing their affections publicly, kissing <b>and</b> <b>leaning</b> on each other. Pepys also wrote that when James {{fell in love with}} Lady Chesterfield, Anne complained to King Charles so insistently that Lady Chesterfield had to retreat to the countryside, where she remained until she died.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{publicise}} the release, Powderfinger decided to film a music video its first track, [...] "Reap What You Sow". The music video {{was directed by}} the advertisement director David Barker of Film Headquarters. This work with Barker proved amicable, and lead to the band's following seven music videos also being directed by him. The [...] "Reap What You Sow" [...] video used black-and-white footage of Fanning lying in a creek floating <b>and</b> <b>leaning</b> on rocks. These scenes are intercut with more black-and-white scenes of the band performing the song, in one setting {{on the side of}} a mountain overlooking their home city of Brisbane. In another setting, the band is shownin full colour playing live to an audience. Later in the video, the whole band are recreating in the creek seen earlier in the video. The video uses a range of filters and effects, including reversed scenes and visual filters.|$|E
500|$|Romania {{qualified}} for the Grand Final in sixth place with 174 points on 11 May 2017, ranked 15th by the jury's 26 points, and third by the televote of 148 points. Soon after, the country was scheduled to perform 20th in the final, following Cyprus and preceding Germany. Florea's [...] "disastrous" [...] attempt to kiss Ilinca {{at the end of}} their performance was the subject of controversy and irony on social media due to her wry facial expression. Adam Miller from Daily Express wrote, [...] "The 18-year-old singer appeared to be mortified when her duet partner came in for the kill, squirming <b>and</b> <b>leaning</b> back to escape Alex's clutches." [...] Ilinca's dress was also deemed too short, with Daily Express writer Helen Daly saying it [...] "flaunted her enviable pins" [...] and [...] "almost revealed more". The country reached seventh place in a field of 26 with 282 points, placed 15th by the jury's 58 points and fifth by the televote of 224 points.|$|E
