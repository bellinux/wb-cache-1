5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Nebraska in {{possession}} of the ball at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line and facing a second down and needing six yards. On the first play of the quarter, Nebraska rusher Brian Schuster was tackled for a five-yard loss in a failed trick play, pushing Nebraska back to the 16-yard line. Sims rushed for eight yards on third down, but failed {{to pick up the}} first down <b>and</b> <b>Nebraska</b> sent kicker Kris Brown into the game.

5|$|The Cornhuskers' offense {{returned}} to the field with 4:58 remaining in the third quarter. Nebraska began at its 39-yard line after the kickoff was returned 23 yards. Frost ran four yards, and Benning earned eight yards with two rushes, giving Nebraska a first down at the Tech 49-yard line. Frost's first pass of the drive fell incomplete, but Benning ran seven yards and Frost completed his second pass of the drive for nine yards and another first down, this time to the Tech 33-yard line. Three more rushes created 10 more yards and another first down, but a bigger loss came to the Tech defense when Hokie All-American Cornell Brown was injured. Nebraska's offense inexorably pressed onward, aided by a 15-yard pass interference penalty against Virginia Tech, <b>and</b> <b>Nebraska</b> capitalized on a six-yard rush by Benning, giving Nebraska a touchdown with 20 seconds remaining in the quarter. The extra point was good, <b>and</b> <b>Nebraska</b> {{returned to}} a 10-point lead, 3121.|$|E
5|$|The Cornhuskers' {{subsequent}} drive did {{not have}} the initial offensive explosion of Tech's drive, but it was in the end more successful. Benning rushed for five yards and Jeff Lake caught a 10-yard pass for a first down at the Nebraska 41-yard line. Frost then threw two incomplete passes and a nine-yard toss to Vershan Jackson. Facing fourth down and needing one yard, Nebraska head coach Tom Osborne elected to attempt to gain the yardage rather than punt the ball. Benning rushed for three yards, <b>and</b> <b>Nebraska</b> was able to convert the fourth down into another first down. Benning followed that success with another, breaking loose for a 33-yard run and the first touchdown of the second half. The extra point was good, <b>and</b> <b>Nebraska</b> extended its lead to 2414 with 4:58 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|Due to Bowl Alliance (predecessor to the Bowl Championship Series) rules, the Orange Bowl {{following}} the 1996 season was played on December 31, instead of January 1 or later. This {{marked the first}} time that an Orange Bowl was played prior to New Year's Day: there were two Orange Bowls in the same calendar year—one in January, {{following the}} 1995 season, and the other in December, following the 1996 season. The Orange Bowl Committee, which had the fourth and sixth selections of eligible Bowl Alliance teams, selected Big East champions Virginia Tech <b>and</b> <b>Nebraska,</b> an at-large selection that appeared to be a national championship game contender before its loss to Texas in the inaugural Big 12 Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|From 1970 through 1998, the Orange Bowl Committee, {{organizers}} of the Orange Bowl, recognized two most valuable players. Following the 63rd Orange Bowl, Virginia Tech running back Ken Oxendine <b>and</b> <b>Nebraska</b> running back Damon Benning were awarded the honor. Oxendine carried the ball 20 times during the game {{for a total of}} 150 rushing yards—an average of 7.5 yards per carry. He also caught three passes for 60 yards, making him the game's leading receiver as well as its leading rusher. Benning, meanwhile, carried the ball 15 times for 96 yards and two touchdowns. He also caught one pass for two yards and returned one kickoff 23 yards.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{was ranked}} No. 1 in the AP Poll and No. 2 in the Coaches Poll before the game, and Ohio State was ranked No. 4 in both polls.

5|$|On June2, {{dozens of}} members of the storm chasing and {{spotting}} communities coordinated a tribute to Tim Samaras, Paul Samaras, and Carl Young. Using GPS transponders over Spotter Network, they aligned themselves to spell out the initials of the three men in North Dakota, South Dakota <b>and</b> <b>Nebraska</b> for many hours. The Discovery Channel scheduled a special tribute episode of Storm Chasers titled Mile Wide Tornado: Oklahoma Disaster on June5, both honoring the three chasers and covering the events of the EF5-rated tornado that struck Moore and portions of southern Oklahoma City eleven days earlier on May20. The November 2013 issue of National Geographic, for its featured cover story, paid tribute to Tim Samaras, a National Geographic Explorer funded in part by the Society, and featured a detailed scientific analysis of the tornado itself.|$|E
5|$|A fossil {{discovered}} in the Horse Room of the Salamander Cave in the Black Hills of South Dakota may possibly be C.dirus; if so, this fossil {{is one of the}} earliest specimens on record. It was catalogued as Canis cf. C.dirus (where cf. in Latin means confer, uncertain). The fossil of a horse found in the Horse Room provided a uranium-series dating of 252,000 yearsYBP and the Canis cf. dirus specimen was assumed to be from the same period. C.armbrusteri and C.dirus share some characteristics (synapomorphies) that imply the latter's descent from the former. The fossil record suggests C.dirus originated around 250,000YBP in the open terrain of the mid-continent before expanding eastward and displacing its ancestor C.armbrusteri. The first appearance of C.dirus would therefore be 250,000YBP in California <b>and</b> <b>Nebraska,</b> and later {{in the rest of the}} United States, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru, but the identity of these earliest fossils is not confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Eastern South Dakota {{generally}} features higher precipitation {{and lower}} topography than {{the western part}} of the state. Smaller geographic regions of this area include the Coteau des Prairies, the Dissected Till Plains, and the James River Valley. The Coteau des Prairies is a plateau bordered on the east by the Minnesota River Valley and on the west by the James River Basin. Further west, the James River Basin is mostly low, flat, highly eroded land, following the flow of the James River through South Dakota from north to south. The Dissected Till Plains, an area of rolling hills and fertile soil that covers much of Iowa <b>and</b> <b>Nebraska,</b> extends into the southeastern corner of South Dakota. Layers deposited during the Pleistocene epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota. These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state, the product of several successive periods of glaciation which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil, known as till, over the area.|$|E

5|$|Eastern South Dakota is {{generally}} wetter and features lower topography than {{the western part}} of the state. Smaller geographic regions of this area include the Coteau des Prairies, the Dissected Till Plains, and the James River Valley. The Coteau des Prairies is a higher region bordered on the east by the Minnesota River Valley and on the west by the James River Basin. Numerous glacial lakes cover the Coteau, and it is largely drained by the Big Sioux River, a tributary of the Missouri. Further to the west, the James River Basin is mostly low, flat, highly eroded land, following the flow of the James River through South Dakota from north to south. The Dissected Till Plains, an area of rolling hills and fertile soil that covers much of Iowa <b>and</b> <b>Nebraska,</b> also extends into the southeastern corner of South Dakota.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of the low {{pressure}} area, a significant blizzard occurred over the northern Great Plains and Upper Midwest, including parts of Minnesota, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Wisconsin, Iowa <b>and</b> <b>Nebraska,</b> where several snowfalls in excess of 8 to 18inches (20–45cm) were reported, as well as snow of between 6 and 11inches (15–28cm) across portions of Ontario and Quebec. Freezing rain was reported across New England, the lower Great Lakes in Ontario, Michigan, and in the Chicago area. 19 people were killed by the storm, including two in Manitoba, two in Ontario, one in Massachusetts, four in North Dakota, one in Minnesota, three in Michigan, five in Wisconsin and one in Nebraska. The University of Minnesota in the Twin Cities was closed for the first time since 1991 and the roof of a supermarket in Wisconsin collapsed. Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty called in the National Guard while governors Chet Culver (Iowa) and Michael Rounds (South Dakota) issued disaster declarations.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers signed their first-ever {{free agents}} in January: former Birmingham Americans <b>and</b> <b>Nebraska</b> guard Tom Alward, Denver Broncos and Notre Dame {{defensive}} end Pete Duranko, and Chicago Bears wide receiver Wayne Wheeler. Having not selected a {{quarterback in the}} veteran allocation draft, they addressed that need in their first-ever trade, a deal to get local favorite Steve Spurrier from the San Francisco 49ers. The former Heisman Trophy winner was obtained for a second-round draft choice {{and two of the}} veteran draftees, Bruce Elia and Willie McGee. An earlier attempt to obtain a quarterback failed when the team sent a future draft pick to the Saints for backup quarterback Larry Cipa, only to waive him when he failed his physical. The Buccaneers also used a third-round pick to obtain defensive back Mike Washington from the Baltimore Colts.|$|E
