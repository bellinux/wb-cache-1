Sadly the Aurora's damaged rudder forced her to return to New Zealand rather than returning for the stranded shore party.|$|E
5|$|Acamprosate may {{stabilise}} {{the brain}} chemistry that is altered due to alcohol dependence via antagonising {{the actions of}} glutamate, a neurotransmitter which is hyperactive in the post-withdrawal phase.

40|$|We {{have used}} {{a large number of}} auroral magnetograms to {{identify}} four isolated substorms and estimate their <b>onset</b> times. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>onsets,</b> ISEE- 1 was in the vicinity of magnetic midnight at radial distances of 15. 6 to 21. 8 Re and very near the outer boundary of the plasma sheet. We find that, for each event, the plasma sheet expanded, and the magnetic field dipolarized <b>at</b> <b>the</b> inferred <b>onset</b> time. Our most definitive event occurred while ISEE was at a geocentric radial distance of 21. 8 Re. This result conflicts with previous understanding, though further verification of the result is required. Our observations show very similar characteristics to those observed at synchronous orbit, and they are consistent with an extension of a portion of the substorm current wedge to the radial distance of the satellite. If this explanation is correct, ISEE must have been within the longitude range of the substorm current wedge <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>onsets...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{association}} was examined between {{the duration of}} computer use <b>at</b> work and <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> of arm-wrist-hand and neck-shoulder symptoms. A prospective cohort study among 1951 office workers was performed with a follow-up period of 2 years. Outcome was assessed every three months by questionnaire. Cases were identified based on the transition within 3 months of no, irregular or "minor" symptoms to regular or prolonged symptoms accompanied with a pain intensity exceeding 6 on a Von Korff scale 20 for worst symptoms or medication use to control symptoms. The results showed that self-reported exposure data were positively associated with <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> of both neck-shoulder and arm-wrist-hand symptoms.

In conclusion, {{the findings of this}} prospective cohort study challenges the existence of a causal link between the duration of computer use <b>at</b> work and <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> of arm-wrist-hand and neck-shoulder symptoms, based on the absence of an association between the registered duration of computer use <b>at</b> work and <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> of arm-wrist-hand and neck-shoulder symptoms.
