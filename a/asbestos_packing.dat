50|$|The coal output accumulates at the pit {{heads and}} cannot be moved. The {{transport}} system is seriously damaged by bombing and under-maintenance. Brown coal {{is no longer}} available in West Germany, since 75 percent of German brown coal lies in the Russian Zone, which is an additional catastrophe. In November 1947 only 70.000 freight cars in the U.S. Zone will be available, instead of 93.000 in January 1947. The reason is the slow rate of repairs resulting from shortage of necessary supplies as lumber, steel, <b>asbestos</b> <b>packing</b> and lagging, cotton waist for journal boxes, oil pads and spare parts of all kind. Key supply parts and even rolling stock should be shipped from the US, before the winter 1947 may have brought a complete breakdown in the transportation system.|$|E
5000|$|In 1855 {{one of the}} {{original}} Turner brothers built, in partnership with another, a cotton mill called Clod Mill alongside the river, at Spotland Fold. The firm of Turner Brothers was formed in 1871, and diversified firstly into the manufacture of <b>asbestos</b> <b>packing,</b> then, by 1879, into weaving asbestos yarn and asbestos cloth. It rapidly assumed a national, and later a global, prominence. The Clod Mill site expanded considerably. Later still, the firm manufactured combination products with rubber and asbestos, including clutch and brake linings, leading to the mill complex being described as [...] "Asbestos and India Rubber Works" [...] in 1910. With the growing awareness {{in the third quarter of}} the 20th Century of the health risks of asbestos, and a growing number of asbestosis claims from past and present employees, the company went into decline, and ceased operations on site. Partial demolition of the works commenced in 2001, though problems continued until 2013.|$|E

40|$|For many {{purposes}} it {{is desirable}} to have a method for the determination f the cation exchange capacity of clay minerals based on principles as free from ambiguity as pos-sible. Most of the many methods previously proposed have the drawback of entailing {{a great deal of}} work if one {{is to make sure that}} the mineral is completely saturated with the reagent in use, or that an excess of the reagent is absent. What might be called the complete chromatographic method by its very nature does not suffer from this diffi-culty. A knov) n weight of clay is suspended on an appropriate inert filter aid (such as Gooch <b>asbestos),</b> <b>packed</b> into a glass tube, and the exchangeable ions eluted with a solution of cesium chloride traced with radioactive Cs 13. 7. The effluent is collected in a series of appropriately sized samples, and the specific radioactivity of each of these determined. When the activity of the effluent has risen to that of the influent solution, one is certain that complete xchange has taken place. A simple computation gives the total cesium holdup of the column, and if the column was initially dry, the exchange capacity of the clay sample. As a routine method, particularly when results of the highest precision are not needed, the effluent may be collected in 0 nly two samples, one large sample and finally one small sample to check for complete xchange. This procedure requires a minimum of work and attention but suffers from the disadvantage that the result depends upon the differ-ence of the two counting rates measured and is thus subject o greater uncertainty. These methods have been compared with the Bower-Truog method (Ind. and Eng...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was undertaken to test the action of polyvinyl pyridine-N-oxide (P 204) on the cytopathic effects of chrysotile asbestos dust in experimental animals. Organ culture studies were undertaken using pieces of guinea-pig lung, {{and in addition to}} this the lesions produced by the intrapleural injection of chrysotile were studied after treatment with varying doses of P 204. The results from both {{series of experiments}} were unfortunately negative and P 204 appeared unable to modify asbestos lesions in any way. These findings contrast sharply with the marked ability of P 204 to protect tissues from the effects of silica dust. It is suggested that these differences are {{due to the fact that}} while silica is rapidly toxic to macrophages, asbestos is not and many healthy macrophages and giant cells can be found in <b>asbestos</b> lesions <b>packed</b> with dust several weeks after injection. The fibrous tissue that is eventually produced in response to asbestos dust is probably produced by a slower and more insidious process than that stimulated by silica, and this process is not modified by the presence of P 204...|$|R
50|$|Krupp {{continued}} {{theoretical research}} on {{a replacement for}} the Paris Gun during the Weimar Republic-era, {{but it was the}} Nazi government that finally authorized funding for experiments to solve some of its worst problems. The extremely high velocities used by the Paris Gun to attain the stratospheric heights necessary for extreme range caused enormous wear of the barrel, {{so much so that the}} shells had to be made in gradually increasing diameter to suit the rate of wear. Even then barrel life was merely 50 rounds. It is believed that the one Paris Gun destroyed by a premature detonation in the bore was caused by loading one of the serially-numbered shells out of order. Thus Krupp decided to use only eight grooves in the barrel and to machine matching ribs or splines on the shells to eliminate the need for a massive copper driving band to start the shell spinning without shearing off, which had been one of the prime causes of the excessive barrel wear in the earlier weapon. Gas sealing would be handled by a copper band, mounted in the place normally occupied by the driving band, with an <b>asbestos</b> and graphite <b>packing</b> to form the initial seal. Several test barrels, known as the 10.5 cm K 12 M, and shells were made in 1935 and were compared to a conventionally rifled barrel (the 10.5 cm K 12 MKu). The tests proved that Krupp's concept was correct.|$|R
