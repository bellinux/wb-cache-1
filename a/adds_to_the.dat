(Praised Be the Lord!), Carpentier offers a diversified understanding of black society and its beliefs in The Kingdom of This World. There exists remarkable respect for accuracy on all sides including historical facts, character names, place names, and even street names.

5|$|Kinky Boots <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public {{discourse}} of gender, and its flexibility and fluidity.

While the show preaches a message of acceptance, this separation of impersonation and identity can cause issues for the transgender community.|$|E
5|$|Like {{a typical}} mobile ransomware, it employs scare tactics to extort {{people to pay}} a ransom. The program pretends to be an accusatory authority, {{demanding}} the victim to pay a fine from $100 to $200 USD or otherwise face a fictitious charge. Rather surprisingly, Fusob suggests using iTunes gift cards for payment. Also, a timer clicking down on the screen <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> users’ anxiety as well.|$|E
5|$|Octave couplers, which add {{the pipes}} an octave above (super-octave) or below (sub-octave) each note that is played, may operate on one {{division}} only (for example, the Swell super octave, which adds the octave above {{what is being}} played on the Swell to itself), or act as a coupler to another keyboard (for example, the Swell super-octave to Great, which <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Great manual {{the ranks of the}} Swell division an octave above what is being played).|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some {{feel that}} the anonymity <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse for. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not. Bathhouses are still used by {{men who have sex}} with men and do not identify as gay or bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|Winds within {{high-pressure}} areas flow {{outward from}} the higher pressure areas near their centers towards the lower pressure areas further from their centers. Gravity <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forces causing this general movement, because the higher pressure compresses the column of air {{near the center of}} the area into greater density – and so greater weight compared to lower pressure, lower density, and lower weight of the air outside the center.|$|E
5|$|Although the Madonna's throne {{is in the}} mid-ground, {{her head}} is level with the {{standing}} figures in the foreground, who are closer in perspective. The apse in which she sits <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> illusion of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach {{can be seen in}} the later Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and the donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E

5|$|Asexual {{organizations}} and other Internet resources {{play a key}} role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are asexual are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does not believe in asexuality, which <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.|$|E
5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a reward and enable {{a person to}} wait for a longer delay, as long as the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E
5|$|Flag {{hoisting}} {{ceremonies and}} cultural programmes {{take place in}} governmental and non-governmental institutions throughout the country. Schools and colleges conduct flag hoisting ceremonies and cultural events. Major government buildings are often adorned with strings of lights. In Delhi and some other cities, kite flying <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> occasion. National flags of different sizes are used abundantly to symbolise allegiance to the country. Citizens adorn their clothing, wristbands, cars, household accessories with replicas of the tri-colour. Over a period of time, the celebration has changed emphasis from nationalism to a broader celebration of all things India.|$|E

5|$|Halo 3 is {{the final}} game in the main Halo trilogy, ending the story arc begun in Halo: Combat Evolved. The game was {{released}} on the Xbox 360 on September 25, 2007. It <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> series new vehicles, new weapons, and a class of items called equipment. The game also includes a limited map-editing tool, known as the Forge, which allows players to insert game objects, such as weapons and crates, into existing multiplayer map geometry. Players can also save a recording of their gameplay sessions, and view them as video, from any angle.|$|E
5|$|Historic {{districts are}} {{generally}} {{two types of}} properties, contributing and non-contributing. Broadly defined, a contributing property is any property, structure or object which <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> historical integrity or architectural qualities that make a historic district, listed locally or federally, significant. Different entities, usually governmental, at {{both the state and}} national level in the United States, have differing definitions of contributing property but they all retain the same basic characteristics. In general, contributing properties are integral parts of the historic context and character of a historic district.|$|E
5|$|The A3 {{section of}} Zagreb bypass is {{currently}} the busiest section of the Croatian motorway network, with annual average daily traffic (AADT) volume exceeding 40,000vehicles, leading to congestion of the six-lane bypass at peak hours, especially during the summer, when tourist traffic <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> congestion. The mainline toll plazas at Bobovica and Ivanja Reka can both become bottlenecks at such times. The alternative to the bypass is going through the city via Ljubljanska, Zagrebačka and Slavonska avenues. Despite being a shorter and a more direct route, those avenues are much more congested than the bypass at rush hours and they contain at-grade intersections and traffic lights at some of their junctions.|$|E

5|$|The Nemesis {{appears in}} a 1999 Hong Kong manhua {{adaptation}} of Resident Evil 3 by Lee Chung Hing, Biohazard 3: Last Escape, which is named after the game's Japanese title. The 27-issue series <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nemesis' backstory, detailing its origin by showing the infection and transformation of the original Tyrant by the Nemesis parasite. Some elements are changed for its design, such as the Nemesis retaining both eyes initially, and then losing the right eye and gaining cranial staples only after an encounter with Jill. The comic also introduces characters from Resident Evil 2 into the storyline, which results in a face-off between the Nemesis and the mutated William Birkin {{towards the end of}} the series.|$|E
5|$|The divine {{represented}} by light is a motif {{in keeping with}} the sentiment of both the Latin text on the hem of Mary's dress (which compares her beauty and radiance to that of divine light) and on the frame. A separate source of light, which also behaves as if from a divine rather than natural source, illuminates her face. The two pools of light behind her have been described as lending the painting a mystical atmosphere, indicating the presence of God. In the niche behind her, the statues are lit by two candles - symbols of the incarnation, whereas she is bathed in natural light. The artificial light <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> overall illusion of the interior of the church, which Pächt views as achieved mainly through colour.|$|E
5|$|The sculpture's roughly cubical {{arrangement}} cleverly {{ensures that}} the overall composition retains a harmonious equilibrium. It is lightened by the artist dispensing with a back slab and incorporating negative space into the piece. By putting {{the children in the}} place of Seneb's legs, the artist <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sense of symmetry. He creates the same impression that would have been made by an ordinary seated figure, preserving an appearance of normality without disguising Seneb's unusual physique. The family's names and titles are given in inscriptions placed {{on either side of the}} children and on the horizontal face of the base.|$|E
