5|$|A {{collective}} {{leadership was}} founded immediately after Khrushchev's ouster, consisting of Brezhnev as First Secretary, Kosygin <b>as</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> government, and Anastas Mikoyan (and later Nikolai Podgorny) <b>as</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> state. From the beginning, Suslov was a vocal critic of one-man rule {{such as that}} seen under Joseph Stalin and Khrushchev. While he condemned Stalin's one-man rule, he equally criticised the individualistic assertiveness of Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation policy. A strong supporter of democratic centralism, Suslov prevented Brezhnev from taking over Kosygin's post <b>as</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> government in 1970. Kirilenko, Brezhnev, and Suslov were members of an unofficial Troika within the Communist Party leadership.|$|E

In the aftermath of Khrushchev's removal, a collective leadership was formed, headed by Brezhnev as First Secretary, Alexei Kosygin <b>as</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> government, and Anastas Mikoyan <b>as</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> state.

In this capacity, Podgorny threatened Brezhnev's position as First Secretary because the Organisational Division, if Podgorny chose so, could easily be turned into his own power base within the party. Brezhnev allied himself with Alexander Shelepin, the KGB chairman, to oppose both Podgorny and Kosygin.|$|E
