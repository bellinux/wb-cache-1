This species is commonly found in various types of soils over a range of pH, although alkaline soils seem more conducive to its growth. It is also known from the roots of wheat, oat and barley. In addition, M.plumbeus is a common fungal contaminant of indoor built environments. This species shares many similarities with M.racemosus, another fungus that belongs to the family Mucoraceae which is known to cause mucormycosis.

500|$|Hippocrates was {{reluctant}} to administer drugs and engage in specialized treatment that might prove to be wrongly chosen; generalized therapy followed a generalized diagnosis. Generalized treatments he prescribed include fasting and the consumption of <b>apple</b> <b>cider</b> vinegar. Hippocrates once said that [...] "to eat when you are sick, is to feed your sickness." [...] However, potent drugs were used on certain occasions. This passive approach was very successful in treating relatively simple ailments such as broken bones which required traction to stretch the skeletal system and relieve pressure on the injured area. The Hippocratic bench and other devices were used to this end.|$|E
500|$|By the {{declaration}} of the American Revolution, with George Washington as its military leader, a number of dietary changes had already occurred in America. Coffee was quickly becoming the normal hot drink of the colonies and a taste for whiskey had been acquired among {{many of those who}} could produce it. In fact, in 1774, the first corn was grown in Kentucky specifically for production of American Bourbon whiskey. This step may have established this American spirit in American culture, just as the country was going to war with England. [...] In addition to whiskey coming into favor, a shift began in the consumption of cider over beer. Colonists opted to grow less barley as it was easier to ferment <b>apple</b> <b>cider</b> than to brew beer. Another reason for this change would have been the lack of imported hops needed to brew beer.|$|E
5000|$|In the UK the Long Ashton Research Station {{categorised}} <b>cider</b> <b>apples</b> in 1903 {{into four}} main types {{according to the}} nature of their flavour components. [...] For cider production {{it is important that the}} fruit contains high sugar levels which encourage fermentation and raise the final alcohol levels. <b>Cider</b> <b>apples</b> therefore often have higher sugar levels than dessert and cooking apples. It is often also considered important for <b>cider</b> <b>apples</b> to contribute tannins, which add depth to the finished cider's flavour.|$|R
50|$|Another horticulturist, Niels Ebbesen Hansen, {{encountered}} M. niedzwetskyana in the Ili {{valley in}} what is now Kazakhstan during his 1897 expedition to Russia, and began two breeding programs based on this unusual fruit, one aimed at developing a cold-hardy cooking and eating apple, and the other aimed at developing ornamental crabapples. His efforts resulted in the Almata apple and the Hopa crabapple, among other varieties. Some of these apples, as well as M. niedzwetskyana itself, are being used for small-scale commercial production of rosé <b>apple</b> <b>ciders.</b>|$|R

500|$|Hard <b>apple</b> <b>cider</b> {{was by far}} {{the most}} common {{alcoholic}} beverage available to colonists. This is because apple trees could be grown locally throughout the colonies, unlike grapes and grain which did not grow well at all in New England. Cider was also easier to produce than beer or wine, so it could be made by farmers for their own consumption. Since it was not imported, it was much more affordable to the average colonist than beer or wine. Apple trees were planted in both Virginia and the Massachusetts Bay Colony as early as 1629. Most of these trees were not grafted, and thus produced apples too bitter or sour for eating; they were planted expressly for making cider. Cider was sometimes also distilled or freeze-distilled into applejack (so called because freeze-distillation was called [...] "jacking"); the cold climate of the Northeast in the wintertime encouraged the process. The beverage was particularly popular in New Jersey, where applejack was occasionally called [...] "Jersey lightning" [...] and was sometimes used to pay road-construction crews.|$|E
500|$|In Present-day Boston, Emma Swan (Morrison) lives {{a lonely}} {{existence}} {{working as a}} bail bondsman and bounty hunter. She is approached by a ten-year-old boy, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), who identifies himself as her son, whom she had given up for adoption as a teenager. Not wanting a relationship with him, Emma agrees to drive {{him back to his}} home in Storybrooke, Maine. Along the way, Henry shows her a large book of fairy tales he has, insisting that all of the stories in it are real. When they arrive in Storybrooke, Henry informs her that everyone in town is in reality a fairy tale character, exiled by the curse and with no memory of their real identities. This includes his therapist Archie Hopper (Raphael Sbarge), who is really Jiminy Cricket, and his teacher Mary Margaret Blanchard (Goodwin), who is really Snow White. Henry claims that time is frozen in Storybrooke and the people are unable to leave, but that the curse will be broken by Emma. A skeptical Emma returns Henry to his adopted mother, the town Mayor, Regina (Parrilla), who is really the Evil Queen. Emma attempts to leave but after having drunk <b>apple</b> <b>cider</b> given to her by the Mayor and nearly hitting a wolf she has a car accident where she is knocked out. She is arrested and taken to Storybrooke Jail. When Henry runs away again, Emma makes a deal with the Mayor and Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan): if they release her, she will find him. After exhausting all possibilities she speaks with Mary Margaret, who tells Emma to [...] "Check his castle." [...] After finding Henry at a wooden jungle gym (which bears a resemblance to Prince Charming's castle), they talk and Emma decides to stay in Storybrooke temporarily, especially after Regina warns her to leave town. This leads Emma to be suspicious of the mayor's motives.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Donna Gooden acts as, {{among other}} things, the town's {{veterinarian}} and medical examiner. On Twin Peaks, Laura's best friend was named Donna, and Donna's father, Dr. Hayward, {{was also the}} town doctor and medical examiner. While drinking a Cherry Coke, Maudette states, [...] "Isn't cherry the best?" [...] Sherilyn Fenn, the actress who portrays Maudette, famously tied a cherry stem into a knot with her tongue in Twin Peaks. Later, Ray Wise suddenly has white hair, just as his Twin Peaks character Leland Palmer's hair turned white overnight in one episode. Dual Spires {{is famous for its}} cinnamon pie and <b>apple</b> <b>cider,</b> as Twin Peaks was famous for cherry pie and [...] "damn fine" [...] coffee. The mayor of Dual Spires is named Douglas Fir, and the town of Twin Peaks was filled with Douglas-fir trees. The local paper in Dual Spires is [...] "The Great Northern," [...] while Twin Peaks had a hotel called the Great Northern. In both series, there are stacks of donuts at the police station. In both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks, a sawmill was the source of the town's livelihood and burned down in a case of arson. Paula Merral is found wrapped in plastic by the lake, just as in Twin Peaks Laura Palmer's body was found [...] "dead, wrapped in plastic" [...] on a rocky beach. The Barkers have a framed prom photo of their niece wearing a tiara prominently displayed, and a similar photo of Laura Palmer remains the iconic Twin Peaks image. Leo the cinnamon owl was the festival mascot, whereas the character of Leo Johnson was suspected of Laura Palmer's murder in Twin Peaks. Owls were a major part of Peaks as well. The pet bird in Dr. Gooden's waiting room was the same type of bird that bit Laura's shoulder in Twin Peaks. There is similar camera work and sound effect focus on a ceiling fan whipping around {{at the top of the}} stairs at Sheriff Jackson's house; this happened often in Twin Peaks. The sheriff's house also looks similar to the Palmers' house. Paula secretly dated the sheriff's son and shared [...] "secret special lover earrings" [...] with him, and in Twin Peaks, Laura and the nephew of one of the townsmen each had half of a golden heart necklace. A local teenage boy wears a jeweled crown. In Peaks, Audrey Horne's older brother wore a Native American headdress. In both series, the sheriff's deputy is a Native American who is very in tune with nature. Sheriff Andrew Jackson's name references the seventh president of the United States, just as the name of the sheriff of Twin Peaks, Harry Truman, references the 33rd. Shawn and Gus find a book written by Earl Wyndam; in Peaks, Windom Earle was a psychopathic ex-FBI agent.|$|E
