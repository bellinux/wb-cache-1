5|$|These are {{species of}} craggy mountainous habitats, {{although}} all three will also frequent human habitation. The <b>African</b> <b>rock</b> <b>martin</b> {{and the south}} Asian dusky crag martin are resident, but the Eurasian crag martin is a partial migrant; birds breeding in southern Europe are largely resident, but some northern breeders and most Asian birds are migratory, wintering in north Africa or India. They do not normally form large breeding colonies, but are more gregarious outside the breeding season. These martins build neat mud nests under cliff overhangs or in crevices in their mountain homes, and have readily adapted to the artificial cliffs provided by buildings and motorway bridges. Up to five eggs, white with dark blotches at the wider end, may be laid, and a second clutch is common. Ptyonoprogne martins feed mainly on insects caught in flight, and patrol cliffs near the breeding site with a slow hunting flight as they seek their prey. They may be hunted by falcons and infected with mites and fleas, but their large ranges and populations mean {{that none of the}} crag martins are considered to be threatened, and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

50|$|The <b>rock</b> <b>martin</b> has a {{very large}} range of 9.5 million km2 (3.7 million sq mi). The total {{population}} is unknown, but the bird is described as generally common, although scarce in Botswana and Namibia. The population {{is thought to be}} stable, mainly due to the absence of evidence of any declines or substantial threats. Its large range and presumably high numbers mean that the <b>rock</b> <b>martin</b> is not considered to be threatened, and it is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|R
50|$|The <b>rock</b> <b>martin</b> is much drabber {{than most}} African swallows, and {{confusion}} is unlikely except with other crag martins or with sand martins {{of the genus}} Riparia. The pale crag martin is smaller, paler and greyer than its southern relative. Although only slightly larger than the sand martin and brown-throated sand <b>martin,</b> the <b>rock</b> <b>martin</b> is more robust, has white tail spots, and lacks a breast band. It is paler on the throat, breast and underwings than the all-dark form of the brown-throated sand martin.|$|R
