5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{has been}} in use for many years but, {{given the number of}} people buried in such a small area, the bodies are no longer decomposing properly. They have begun to overflow and fall into the neighbouring houses as greater excavations take place and basement walls are weakened. The entire area is also permeated with a foul smell, turning fresh produce rotten in far shorter times than natural and tainting the breath of those who live there. Baratte finds that he has both friends and enemies in the area – the cemetery is both loved <b>and</b> <b>hated</b> by the people of the district. He finds resistance from all sides, notably Ziguette who strikes Baratte during his sleep in opposition to his work. He befriends the church's flamboyant organist named Armand, recruits his old colleague Lecoeur to assist with the excavation, is monitored by the infamous Guillotin and falls in love with Heloïse, widely known in the area as a whore.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Gilbert {{travelled}} to Italy in 1838 {{and then}} France {{for two years}} with his parents, who finally returned to settle in London in 1847. He was educated at Boulogne, France, {{from the age of}} seven (he later kept his diary in French so that the servants could not read it), then at Western Grammar School, Brompton, London, and then at the Great Ealing School, where he became head boy and wrote plays for school performances and painted scenery. He then attended King's College London, graduating in 1856. He intended to take the examinations for a commission in the Royal Artillery, but {{with the end of the}} Crimean War, fewer recruits were needed, and the only commission available to Gilbert would have been in a line regiment. Instead he joined the Civil Service: he was an assistant clerk in the Privy Council Office for four years <b>and</b> <b>hated</b> it. In 1859 he joined the Militia, a part-time volunteer force formed for the defence of Britain, with which he served until 1878 (in between writing and other work), reaching the rank of Captain. In 1863 he received a bequest of £300 that he used to leave the civil service and take up a brief career as a barrister (he had already entered the Inner Temple as a student), but his legal practice was not successful, averaging just five clients a year.|$|E

40|$|Love <b>and</b> <b>hate</b> {{are basic}} human affects. Previous {{research}} has focused on the classification, functions, and other aspects of these two affects. However, few studies have been conducted on the relationship between love <b>and</b> <b>hate.</b> The present study investigated whether similarity within romantic partners was associated with greater feelings of love in the absence of betrayal, <b>and</b> greater <b>hate</b> induced in the presence of betrayal by using vignettes to induce love <b>and</b> <b>hate</b> in a sample of 59 young adults. The results showed that people who shared similar values and interests with the target persons were more likely to experience stronger love. Additionally, stronger feelings of love were associated with greater hate after the relationship was broken, suggesting a link between romantic love <b>and</b> <b>hate.</b> Our study revealed a complex picture of love <b>and</b> <b>hate.</b> People have different emotional reactions toward different target persons in the context of romantic love <b>and</b> <b>hate.</b> If one loves someone deeply <b>and</b> sometimes <b>hates</b> that person, the feeling of love may still be dominant in the context of betrayal. However, if one does not love that person, hate will be a much stronger feeling than love...|$|R

25|$|Deng Ai was {{promoted}} to General Who Guards the West (鎮西將軍) and {{put in charge of}} overseeing military affairs in the region. The reason for Jiang Wei's defeat at Shanggui was the failure of the Shu general Hu Ji to show up in time with reinforcements to assist Jiang Wei. The failure of this ninth expedition resulted in Shu sustaining heavy losses of lives and resources; the people of Shu resented <b>and</b> <b>hated</b> Jiang Wei even more. Jiang Wei wrote a memorial to the Shu imperial court, requesting to be demoted as punishment. The court approved and demoted him to the position of General of the Guards (衞將軍). However, despite his demotion, Jiang Wei was still allowed to act in the capacity of his previous appointment as General-in-Chief (大將軍).|$|E
25|$|Two {{days later}} the first deaths were reported. No attempt {{was made by the}} New Zealand administrators to quell or contain the spread, and after one week it had spread through the whole of Samoa. Whole {{families}} were killed, with such alarming speed that corpses lay around for weeks without being buried. They were either thrown in mass graves or left in houses which were torched. However, in American Samoa, where quarantine precaution measures had been adequately taken, there were no deaths. Upon learning of the current situation in Western Samoa, the American Governor offered help to Colonel Logan who was in charge; Logan was British born <b>and</b> <b>hated</b> Americans. He destroyed the telegram and cut off any other contact to American Samoa. The Americans had a large medical team who could have saved many lives.|$|E
25|$|Known {{for both}} his intense {{competitive}} nature and violent temper, Cleghorn was {{considered one of}} the toughest and dirtiest players of his time. Respected by his teammates <b>and</b> <b>hated</b> by his opponents, Cleghorn frequently used his stick as a weapon and was routinely among his team's leaders in both goals and penalty minutes. He claimed to have been involved in at least 50 incidents during his career in which a player left the ice on a stretcher. In the season which Ottawa unsuccessfully attempted to have him banned from the NHL, Cleghorn led the league in penalty minutes with 80. According to some accounts, Evelyn Byng, Viscountess Byng of Vimy, was so mortified by Cleghorn's style that she donated the Lady Byng Trophy to the NHL in 1924 in a bid to encourage more sportsmanlike play.|$|E

25|$|The {{people of}} Gilgit thought {{themselves}} to be ethnically different from the Kashmiris and resented being under Kashmir state rule. Gilgit {{was also one of}} the most backward areas of the Kashmir state. Major William Brown, the Maharaja's commander of the Gilgit Scouts, believed that the British handover of Gilgit to Kashmir was a huge mistake. Brown recounts that when he met the scouts they indirectly made it clear how they despised <b>and</b> <b>hated</b> Kashmir and everything connected with it, how happy and content they had been under the British rule, and how they considered they had been betrayed by the British in the unconditional handing over of their country to Kashmir. Taking advantage of the situation the populace of Gilgit-Baltistan started revolting, the people of Ghizer were first to raise the flag of revolution, and gradually the masses of entire region stood up against the rule of Maharaja, again British played an important role in war of independence of Gilgit-Baltistan.|$|E
25|$|In {{view of the}} situation, Junot {{decided to}} abandon {{the north and south}} of the country and {{concentrate}} his army in central Portugal. He ordered Loison to leave a garrison in Almeida and march to Lisbon. Maximilien Sebastien Foy claimed that only one of twenty messages got through. Culling from his ranks all the troops unfit to march, he made up a garrison of 1,200 men to hold Almeida. Leaving the garrison behind, he put the rest of his men on the road on 4 July. He successfully fought his way through partisan ambushes for a week and lost 200 men. When Guarda resisted, the place was sacked and partly burned down. His troops left such a path of destruction that Loison became feared <b>and</b> <b>hated</b> in Portugal as Maneta or One-Hand. That Loison was missing one hand is shown by an incident that occurred before the First Battle of Porto in March 1809. The day before the battle Foy was captured by a Portuguese outpost and led into the city. Believing he was the reviled Loison, the mob was about to murder their prisoner when Foy held up both hands, proving he was not Maneta and was spared.|$|E
25|$|However, the Isunians, Yudghanites, ‘Ukabarites, and Mishawites all held {{views that}} did not accord with those of either the ‘Ananites or the Karaites. Abu ‘Isa al-Isfahani, who was an {{illiterate}} tailor, {{claimed to be a}} prophet, prohibited divorce, claimed that all months should have thirty days, believed in Jesus and Muhammad as prophets, and told his followers that they must study the New Testament and the Qur’an. Yudghan was a follower of ‘Isa al-Isfahani and claimed to be a prophet and the Messiah, saying that the observance of Shabbat and Holy Days was no longer obligatory. Isma‘’il al-‘Ukbari believed he was the prophet Elijah, <b>and</b> <b>hated</b> ‘Anan. Mishawayh al-‘Ukbari, who was a disciple of Isma‘’il al-‘Ukbari and the founder of the Mishawites, taught his followers to use a purely solar calendar of 364 days and 30-day months, insisting that all the Holy Days and fast days should always occur on fixed days in the week, rather than on fixed days of the months. He further said that Shabbat should be kept from sunrise on Saturday to sunrise on Sunday. Most Ananites and Karaites rejected such beliefs.|$|E

25|$|Around December 1240 {{news came}} that the Mongols were {{advancing}} towards Hungary. King Bela then installed front line defenses at the Carpathian Mountains, {{after which he}} returned to Buda and called a council of war and ordered unity against the Mongols. The opposite happened, however, {{as many of the}} barons were hostile towards the Cumans. The Hungarian barons noted that there were Cumans in the Mongol armies, but they didn't realize that this was because they were conscripted into it and had no say in the matter. In particular the barons didn't trust Koten, {{despite the fact that the}} Mongols had attacked his people for nearly 20 years. This chaos pushed Bela into a corner; feeling he needed to show his strength and keep the rebellious barons onside, he ordered Koten to be placed under house arrest. This did not placate the barons and had an opposite effect of erroneously seeming to admit that the King harboured doubts about Koten, too. This angered the Cumans, who were far from happy about the actions taken against them, and who had done nothing to invite such actions <b>and</b> <b>hated</b> the Mongols. News arrived on 10 March that the Mongols had attacked the Hungarian defenses at the Carpathian passes. This prompted Bela to send a letter to Duke Frederick of Austria asking for help. Frederick had previously wanted Bela's throne, but Bela responded by amassing a vast army and marching to the gates of Vienna, which forced Frederick to step back. On March 14 news had arrived that the Carpathian defense forces were defeated by the Mongols. Ironically, given the suspicion of the Cumans, they were the only ones who seemed willing to fight the Mongols, the memory of the fate that had befallen them on the steppes still being fresh in their minds. At the time the Hungarian forces were cowered behind the walls of Sibiu. By this time Bela had lost control of his army and many towns were destroyed. Soon thereafter Frederick arrived, and, wishing to harm the country's defense (in revenge to Bela), he stirred up further feelings against the Cumans.|$|E
