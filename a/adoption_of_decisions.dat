40|$|Background: There is {{evidence}} to suggest that decision aids improve a number of patient outcomes. However, {{little is known about the}} progression of research effort in this area over time. This literature review examined the volume of research published in 2000, 2007 and 2014 which tested the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> aids in improving cancer patient outcomes, coded by cancer site and decision type being targeted. These numbers were compared with the volume of research examining the effectiveness of strategies to increase the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> aids by healthcare providers. Methods: A literature review of intervention studies was undertaken. Medline, Embase, PsychInfo and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched. The search was limited to human studies published in English, French, or German. Abstracts were assessed against eligibility criteria by one reviewer and a random sample of 20 % checked by a second. Eligible intervention studies in the three time periods were categorised by: i) whether they tested the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> aids, coded by cancer site and decision type, and ii) whether they tested strategies to increase healthcare provider <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> aids. Results: Over the three time points assessed, increasing research effort has been directed towards testing the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> aids in improving patient outcomes (p < 0. 0001). The number <b>of</b> studies on <b>decision</b> aids for cancer screening or prevention increased statistically significantly (p < 0. 0001) whereas the number of studies on cancer treatment did not (p = 1. 00). The majority of studies examined the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> aids for prostate (n = 10), breast (n = 9) or colon cancer (n = 7). Only two studies assessed the effectiveness of implementation strategies to increase healthcare provider <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> aids. Conclusions: While the number of studies testing the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> aids has increased, the majority of research has focused on screening and prevention decision aids for only a few cancer sites. This neglects a number of cancer populations, as well as other areas of cancer care such as treatment decisions.

Yet, traces of their origin can be found in Magna Carta, signed by the King of England in 1215. It was a turning point in human rights. Namely, it enumerates what later came {{to be thought of as}} human rights. Among them was also the right of all free citizens to own and inherit property. The European Convention on Human Rights was heavily influenced by British legal traditions, including Magna Carta. Among other rights, it also guaranties the right to property as a human right. Moreover, the protection of property rights has been extended to intellectual property rights as well. Namely, the European Court of Human Rights has provided protection of intellectual property rights through the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> that interpret the right to property, in relation to intellectual property protection claims.

40|$|Because {{environmental}} regulations may be adjusted {{over time to}} reflect updated understanding or new circumstances, there may be scope for strategic behaviour too. Regulations affect not only current emission levels, but also the effect on investment in R&D or new plant and equipment and, consequently, on competitive priorities. Although most of the literature devoted to the environmental regulation highlights the effects that legislation has on the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> related to the environment as a competitive opportunity, there is actually no strong empirical evidence which supports that argument. This is why the present paper has as its aim to identify (1) how the regulation concerning the natural environment differs across sectors and (2) how it can influence managerial perceptions of the role to be played by the natural environment as a competitive opportunity. The research work {{has been carried out}} in two phases. The first phase involved comparative case studies of eight Spanish firms; during the second, the propositions emerging from the first phase were tested through a structural equation model of 239 hotels and 208 firms affected by the IPPC law in Spain. This paper has made a contribution to the existing research literature through the examination of the similarities and differences concerning managerial decision-making in the field of natural environment regulations. Moreover, a contact point between the Porter hypothesis and its criticism is offered. In relation to practical implications, updated information about the European, National and Community environmental legislation is presented that affects firms from eight sectors. In this context, legal environmental requirements are identified so as to make easier the adoption of managerial decisions which guarantee compliance with the law and avoidance of fines.

40|$|Development {{of social}} and {{economic}} systems is characterized by cyclic dynamics of the changes happening in them. These changes affect various parties and levels of an economic system, its structure, forming a number of regularities. Among them regularities of development of economic cycles in various types of economic nonequilibrium systems are of considerable inter-est. Not smaller interest is received to what factors exert impact on structure of reproduction processes, and also on processes of <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> by the main economic agents. The last, in turn, in many respects determine the nature and dynamics of the shift phase in economic cycles. During the research the author's technique allowed to predict the shift phase in short-term economic cycles which with rather high probability and accuracy permits predicting dynamics of cyclic development of economy for the short-term period. Seven subindexes characterizing institutional and tactical shifts in the social and economic systems participating in development of the integrated indicator (an index of the advancing development) estimating expectations of economic agents with use of a method of the taxonomical analysis, allowing determining most authentically the specific weight of each of the received subindexes entered in this model. As a result of the realized estimates and calculations the conclusion was drawn that the largest level of impact on parameters of cyclic development of market economy, by means of generation of the corresponding phase shifts, the factors characterizing the level of development of a human capital, social well-being, and also research potential have. Possible reasons for a main hypothesis about the determining nature of influence of expectations of economic agents on structural and economic shifts of economy the analysis of their influence on parameters of an industrial development in case of various types of an economic disbalance is performed. As the main approaches promoting carrying out this stage of work the methods of economic-mathematical modeling allowed to reveal dependences between the endogenous variable (index of industrial production) and an exogenous variable reflecting dynamics of an index of the advancing development estimat-ing the level of the created expectations of economic agents in time are chosen. By results of the carried-out estimates, it is proved that exposure of dynamics of industrial production to the adjusted expectations has less obvious character. Value of coefficient in case of the indicator esti-mating an index of the advancing development made 1, 77 that is much lower than a similar indicator for economy with the weakened levers of administrative pressure. Summing up the results concerning a role of expectations of economic agents in economic development of systems of various type, it is established that extent of their influence is inversely proportional to development of the administrative markets and different administrative restrictions...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the way in}} which certain foreign policy decisions were made in the latter stages of the Republican-Royalist war of the 1960 s. It seeks to explain how decisions were made, under what circumstances, who the decision-makers were, and what the influences were, internal as well as external, which bore on the foreign policy making of the Yemeni Republic. In addressing these questions four major decisions are analysed. These are: 1. The rejection of the Khartoum Agreement on Yemen concluded by the Egyptian President Djamal Abd al-Nasir and King Faysal of Saudi Arabia on 31 August, 1967; 2. The recognition of the independence of the People's Republic of South Yemen on 30 November, 1967; 3. The resumption of diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany on 15 July, 1969; 4. The acceptance of the proposed reconciliation agreement with Saudi Arabia and the Yemeni Royalists on 31 March, 1970. These decisions were all made {{in the second half of}} the war, beginning at a time when Egyptian influence in Yemen had receded and a more autonomous YAR policy was emerging. These decisions were made by different elites, in response to various stimuli, and under divergent settings and could thus be taken as representative of YAR decision-making in this period. This investigation confirms that in Yemen, as with other third world countries, the decision-making process was dominated by personalities, and in particular by the two heads of state, Marshal Abdallah al- Sallal and Kadi Abd al-Rahman al-Iryani. However, contrary to the assumption of the primacy in the decision-making process of the personal predispositions of the principal decision-makers, especially in stress situations, the personal predisposition of the two heads of the Yemeni Republic were largely subordinated to the supreme objective of the regime defined in terms of the survival of the Republican system. External factors helped to shape the decision-making process. The YAR, as a poor-resource developing state, had insufficient capacity to either defend itself against the Royalist military threat or achieve other less vital objectives such as economic development. For these, it had to rely on external assistance and as a result, other states, especially the UAR and USSR in the pre- 1968 era, became important in the decision-making calculus. In another aspect, the Royalist threat dictated the need for solidarity within the YAR governing elite and facilitated the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> on the crucial issue of security by consensus. Similarity of views and the existence of shared values among the post-November 5, 1967 government, ensured the perpetuation of this pattern of decision-making with respect to almost all issues. One of the objectives of the study is to contribute to analysing comparative foreign policy decision-making, and some conclusions are related to propositions pertaining to decision-making in third world countries. However, other conclusions show that, in the Yemeni situation, the existing theories have only limited applicability...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} of the nomenklatura as the central instrument of the Soviet Unionâs cadre policy is primarily channelled towards lists of nomenklatura positions {{and the people who}} filled those positions, yet the functioning of the nomenklatura as a bureaucratic system for approving and harmonizing cadres has gone almost entirely unnoticed on both the USSR-wide and the local Union republic levels. This article examines the appointment and dismissal of members of the Government of the Estonian SSR â the Council of Ministers of the Estonian SSR â during the late Stalinist years of 1944 â 53 in order to gain a clearer understanding of the dynamics of relations between the central authority and the Union republic in implementing the nomenklatura system and the relationship between the Party and state organs in making cadre decisions. In the nomenklatura hierarchy, the members of the Union republicâs government belonged to the higher level CPSU Central Committee nomenklatura as well as the Party Central Committee nomenklatura of the Union republic. This meant that the conclusive approval of their appointment to their post and their dismissal could take place on the basis of decisions made by the CPSU CC. Yet formally, the constitution legally prescribed the procedure for appointing members of the government to office and for dismissing them. According to this procedure, the formation of the Union republicâs government belonged to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Soviet as the highest organ of state authority in the Union republic. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet functioned in its name during the intervals between sessions of the Supreme Soviet in dismissing individual members of the government from their posts and in appointing them to office. Thus the peculiarities of processing cadre decisions derived from the fact that members of the government belonged to the CPSU CC nomenklatura and from the constitution, for which reason Party rights, in other words mechanisms based on nomenklatura had to be tied in with constitutional mechanisms in appointing and dismissing members of the government. It appears from this study that the processing and approval of cadre decisions concerning members of the Union republicâs government took place first of all in the Party organs in accordance with Party rights pursuant to nomenklatura regulations, and thereafter in state organs, where the requisite legislative acts were drawn up. This study arrives at the conclusion that nomenklatura and constitutional regulation made it possible to process and adopt cadre decisions as a routine bureaucratic procedure. Procedural cases of cadre decisions concerning members of the Estonian SSR Council of Ministers, however, allude to frequent distortions and violations that manifested themselves as deviations in the sequence of the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> and less frequently in cases where even the decision of the Party or of the state organs was not adopted at all. In summary, there were admittedly disruptions in the implementation of the nomenklatura system, yet the existence of nomenklatura mechanisms nevertheless enabled Party organs to effectively control and direct the placement of cadres in state organs, and the CPSU CC, in turn, to control the placement of leading cadres in the Union republics.

The purpose of the study. The aim {{of the study is}} to base the application of situational control of information security by subsystem of the control and protection of information in automated learning systems and to develop implementation methods of the situational control concept. Materials and methods. It is assumed that the automated learning system is a fragment of a larger information system that contains severalÂ information paths, each of them treats different information in the protection degree from information, containing constituting state secrets, to open access information. It is considered that the technical methods, measures and means of information protection in automated learning systems implement less than half (30 %) functions of subsystems of control and protection information. The main part of the functions of this subsystem are organizational measures to protect information. It is obvious that the task of ensuring the security of information in automated learning systems associated with the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> on rational selection and proper combination of technical methods and institutional arrangements. Conditions of practical application of automated learning systems change over time and transform the situation of such a decision, and this leads to the use of situational control methods. When situational control is implementing, task of the protection of information in automated learning system is solved by the subsystem control and protection of information by distributing the processes ensuring the security of information and resources of subsystem elements of the automated learning system to meet changing conditions of operation. When the event, associated with the emergence of threats to the information security related to one of the elements of a situation to a variety of destabilizing factors is checked in the system, the formation of the base of alternative control actions sets of situational management is formed, then the sets of the admissible solutions of the situational control options are formed.

Developed method of situational control of information security in automated learning systems, involves the participation of the operator in the development and decision-making (dialogue procedures statement of objectives situational control, the formation of the base of alternative sets of control actions, etc.). Another important feature of this technique is the necessity of using previously developed models (models of decision-making situation, a model of coordination and planning of operation of a subsystem of the control and protection of information, models of information processing about the status of the subsystem analysis models and evaluation of results) and the database obtained on the basis of operating experience of information protection systems in the automated learning systems. The implementation of the concept of situational control of information security ensures the timely adaptation of the algorithms and parameters of the information security system to changes in the external environment and the nature of tasks within the education systems and on this basis allows to improve the characteristics of the information protection system in the automated learning systems. </p...|$|E

V nadaljevanju sem opisala poslovne sestanke, kar je tema te diplomske naloge. OsredotoÄila sem se na pripravo in izvedbo poslovnih sestankov, s poudarkom na produktivnih udeleÅ¾encih, opredelila pa sem tudi vse dejavnike, ki jih je upoÅ¡tevati za uspeÅ¡nost poslovnih sestankov. NamreÄ pred uresniÄitvijo vseh zahtev za izvedbo takÅ¡nih sestankov, je potrebno vloÅ¾iti precejÅ¡njo mero truda in energije, vkljuÄno z organizacijo. V vse to je vÅ¡teto vabilo, opredelitev kraja, Äasa in prostora, ustrezne opreme, predvsem avdiovizualne, 2 Ì 72 Ì 7 rdeÄe niti 2 Ì 72 Ì 7 ali cilja oziroma namena, sprejetja sklepov, itd. UpoÅ¡tevati je treba tudi morebitne teÅ¾ave, ki sem jih in tudi naÄine za reÅ¡evanje oziroma njih odpravo, tudi opisala. Enako tudi stroÅ¡ke poslovnih sestankov, s poudarkom na opraviÄljivosti le-teh v poslovni praksi, Äe je priprava in izvedba poslovnih sestankov kvalitetno izpeljana. Tudi uÄinkovitost poslovnih sestankov sem prouÄila, predvsem v primerjavi, npr. s telefonskimi ali osebnimi razgovori, kljub temu, da so poslovni sestanki draÅ¾ja oblika komuniciranja. Pri tem sem upoÅ¡tevala svojo poslovno prakso oziroma lastne izkuÅ¡nje iz udeleÅ¾b v razliÄnih poslovnih sestankih, ki sem se jih in se jih Å¡e udeleÅ¾ujem, predvsem v razliÄnih sluÅ¾bah, ki sem jih udejanjala, in tudi v raznih volonterskih druÅ¡tvih, organizacijah in kroÅ¾kih ter tudi v razliÄnih delavnicah. V zakljuÄku diplomske naloge sem napisala deset pravil in deset svaril, ki jih smemo oziroma ne smemo udejanjati na poslovnih sestankih, in vpraÅ¡alnik za ocenjevanje poslovnega sestanka, za vse udeleÅ¾ence, vkljuÄno z vodjo. In the {{beginning}} of my thesis I have briefly described the concept of a meeting and I have also written some useful guidelines to realize them efficiently. In the continuation I have also described business meetings, which are the main issue of my work. I focused mainly on the preparation procedure and the performance of business meetings, with the emphasis on productive participants and have defined the main factors that have to be taken in account for successful management of business meetings. For the organization and implementation of such meetings much effort and energy are needed. From the invitations to the definition of place, time and manner to the adequate equipment, common thread, aims and purposes and accepting agreements. One must also consider possible issues, difficulties and think of ways to solve them in the efficient manner, also monetary cost of meetings, with the emphasis of excusable reasons in business practice, when the meeting is well organized and of high standard. I have also studied the efficiency of business meetings in comparison to interviews over the phone or in person, regardless of the communication in meetings being of higher cost. I have taken into account my personal experience from attending different business meetings though my previous occupation and also through my voluntary work in organizations, workshops and civil societies. I conclude my work with ten rules and ten warnings, which need to be followed in business meetings followed by a questionnaire for the evaluation of a business meeting, of the participants, including the leader. Namely, before the realization of all the requirements for the implementation of such meetings, it is necessary to invest a considerable amount of effort and energy, including with organization. In all of this is included the invitation, the definition of the place, time and space, appropriate equipment, especially audiovisual, âred lineâ or objective or purpose, the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions,</b> etc. Consideration should also be potential problems that I have and the ways to solve or eliminate them, as described. Similarly, the cost of business meetings, with an emphasis on excusable them in business practice, if the preparation and implementation of high quality business meetings derived. I even studied the the bussiness meetings especially when compared, for example. by telephone or personal interviews, {{despite the fact that they}} are business meetings more expensive form of communication. In doing so, I take into account their business practices and their own experience of participation in different business meetings that I have, and they are attending, in particular in various departments, which I help to achieve, and also in various of voluntary associations, organizations and clubs, as well as in various workshops. In conclusion of the thesis I wrote ten rules and the ten things that you should or should not materialize at business meetings and a questionnaire for the assessment of a business meeting, for all participants, including the leader...|$|E

Many studies have been conducted to understand users 2 Ì 7 <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> the clinical <b>decision</b> support system. A critical review was conducted to understand the theoretical or conceptual frameworks used to inform the studies on the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> the clinical <b>decision</b> support system. The review identified 15 theoretical and conceptual frameworks using multiple hybrids of theories and concepts. The Technology Acceptance Model was the most frequently used baseline framework combined with frameworks such as the diffusion of innovation, social theory, longitudinal theory, and so on. The results from these articles yielded multiple concepts influencing the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> the clinical <b>decision</b> support system. These concepts can be recategorized into nine major concepts, namely, the information system, person (user or patient), social, organization, perceived benefits, emotions, trustability, relevance (fitness), and professionalism. None of the studies found all the nine concepts. That said, most of them have identified the information system, organization, and person concepts as three of its concepts affecting the use <b>of</b> the clinical <b>decision</b> support system. Within each of the concepts, its subconcepts were noted to be very varied. Yet each of these subconcepts has significantly contributed toward the different facets of the concepts. A pluralistic framework was built using the concepts and subconcepts to provide an overall framework construct for future study on the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> the clinical <b>decision</b> support system...|$|R
