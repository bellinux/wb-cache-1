Eastwood further {{explained}} his anti-war stance by saying [...] "I was {{a child growing up}} during World War II. That {{was supposed to be the}} one to end all wars. And four years later, I was standing at the draft board being drafted during the Korean conflict, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> there was Vietnam, and it goes on and on forever … I just wonder … does this ever stop? And no, it doesn't. So each time we get in these conflicts, it deserves a lot of thought before we go wading in or wading out. Going in or coming out. It needs a better thought process, I think." [...] Furthermore, Eastwood's 2014 movie American Sniper was met with strong critical praise, especially from many Republicans who called it a pro-War on Terror, pro-Republican, and patriotic film; Eastwood responded by saying that such notions represented a [...] "stupid analysis" [...] and that the movie had nothing to do with political parties. Eastwood responded to critics of American Sniper by saying his film was [...] "the biggest anti-war statement any film can make", and that the film depicts [...] "the fact of what [...] does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did" [...] and [...] "what it (war) does to the people left behind." ...|$|E
500|$|Epstein had {{no prior}} {{experience}} of artist management, {{yet he had}} a strong influence on the band's early dress code and stage demeanor. They had previously worn blue jeans and leather jackets, and they would stop and start songs when they felt like it or when an audience member requested a certain song. David Pomerran Szatmary states that when Epstein first saw them at The Cavern Club, he thought, [...] "They were a scruffy crowd in leather, {{and they were not}} very tidy and not very clean. They smoked as they played and they ate and talked and pretended to hit each other." [...] Epstein encouraged them to wear suits and ties, insisted that they stop swearing, smoking, drinking, or eating on stage, and also suggested the famous synchronised bow {{at the end of their}} performances. McCartney was the first to agree with Epstein's suggestions, believing that they reflected Epstein's RADA training. Epstein explained that the process from leather jackets and jeans to suits took some time: [...] "I encouraged them, at first, to get out of the leather jackets and jeans, and I wouldn't allow them to appear in jeans after a short time, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> step, I got them to wear sweaters on stage, and then, very reluctantly, eventually, suits." [...] Epstein took the group to Wirral to see his friend, master tailor Beno Dorn, who made them their first suits based on a design they had previously seen, but which Epstein approved of: [...] "I thought it was an excellent design at the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{an owner}} trust, {{there is more}} {{flexibility}} in allocating principal and interest received to different classes of issued securities. [...] In an owner trust, both interest and principal due to subordinate securities {{can be used to}} pay senior securities. [...] Due to this, owner trusts can tailor maturity, risk and return profiles of issued securities to investor needs. [...] Usually, any income remaining after expenses is kept in a reserve account up to a specified level <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> all income is returned to the seller. Owner trusts allow credit risk to be mitigated by over-collateralization by using excess reserves and excess finance income to prepay securities before principal, which leaves more collateral for the other classes.|$|E
2500|$|Although Epstein had had {{no prior}} {{experience}} of artist management, {{he made it clear}} that he wanted to change the Beatles’ early dress-code and attitude on stage, as they wore blue jeans and leather jackets, smoked, ate and swore, stopped and started songs when they felt like it, pretended to hit each other, and turned their backs to the audience. Epstein put a stop to their behaviour, insisting they wear more suitable clothes, and later suggested the famous synchronised bow at the end of their performances. Epstein: [...] "I encouraged them, at first, to get out of the leather jackets and jeans, and I wouldn't allow them to appear in jeans after a short time, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> step, I got them to wear sweaters on stage, and then, very reluctantly, eventually, suits".|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Independent, Rowland admitted that with her first two records she struggled to find her sound.

[...] She further described the songs on her previous albums as sounding very much the same, which {{led her to the}} realisation that she [...] "needed refreshing". She told Entertainment Focus that meeting French DJ David Guetta [...] "changed her perspective and helped to inspire the new sound". She then spent more time in Europe in 2009, something which she said had influenced her. [...] "It's different being over here in Europe and just being able to look at different magazines and fashion shows and things like that. And just thinking about the look and working with different stylists as well. I wanted {{to make sure it was}} a look that was all me, you know?." [...] She noted that seeing people's reactions to dance music made her feel [...] "completely intoxicated!." [...] In July 2010, Rowland said during {{an interview}} with Alex Catarinella of Paper magazine that [...] "I spent about a year of my life in Europe really listening to a whole bunch of European DJs and hearing dance music a lot on the radio and really loving it. 'When Love Takes Over' was my first introduction to dance music [...] it was a whole other monster. It's really a culture and I love it." ...|$|E
