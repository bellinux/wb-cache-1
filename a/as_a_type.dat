40|$|AbstractThe paper (first {{written in}} 1969 and {{circulated}} privately) concerns the definition, axiomatization, and {{applications of the}} hereditarily monotone and continuous functionals generated from the integers and the Booleans (plus “undefined” elements). The system is formulated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>typed</b> system of combinators (or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>typed</b> λ-calculus) with <b>a</b> recursion operator (the least fixed-point operator), and its proof rules are contrasted {{to a certain extent}} with those of the untyped λ-calculus.

5|$|A beefsteak {{is a type}} of banquet {{in which}} sliced beef {{tenderloin}} is served to diners as all-you-can-eat finger food. The dining style originated in 19th-century New York City <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>type</b> of working-class celebration but went into a decline in the mid-20th century. Resurrected by caterers in New Jersey, the beefsteak banquet style is now popular in that state's Bergen and Passaic counties, and is enjoying a revival in New York City, where the style originated, due to the reemergence of a biannual beefsteak in Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|A slow-rotating {{white dwarf}} star can not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses without {{collapsing}} to form a neutron star or exploding <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Type</b> Ia supernova. Once the white dwarf reaches this mass, such as by accretion or collision, the gravitational force would exceed the pressure exerted by the electrons. If the white dwarf is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity is diminished in the equatorial region, thus allowing the white dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can occur, for example, {{as a result of}} mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum.|$|E

Nathaniel Lord Britton and Joseph Nelson Rose believe that Forbes was given that name by Ludwig Karl Georg Pfeiffer, but the plant was actually Mammillaria spinosissima.|$|E

5|$|Early on, manning {{a castle}} was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later {{replaced}} with paid forces. A garrison was usually commanded by a constable whose peace-time role {{would have been}} looking after the castle in the owner's absence. Under him would have been knights who by benefit of their military training would have acted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>type</b> of officer class. Below them were archers and bowmen, whose role was to prevent the enemy reaching the walls {{as can be seen}} by the positioning of arrowslits.|$|E
5|$|FH is {{classified}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>type</b> 2 familial dyslipidemia. There are five types of familial dyslipidemia (not including subtypes), and each are classified {{from both the}} altered lipid profile and by the genetic abnormality. For example, high LDL (often due to LDL receptor defect) is type 2. Others include defects in chylomicron metabolism, triglyceride metabolism, and metabolism of other cholesterol-containing particles, such as VLDL and IDL.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mass}} of the nucleus {{following}} a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>type</b> of usable energy (such as a gamma ray, or the kinetic energy of a beta particle), as described by Albert Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula, E=mc2, where m is the mass loss and c is the speed of light. This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.|$|E

5|$|In Queensland, P. fimbriata is {{reluctant}} {{to jump into the}} webs of prey spiders, while other Portia species do this at any opportunity. The Queensland orb web spider Argiope appensa shakes its web violently to shake off intruders, and P. fimbriata finds a detour that allows it to abseil on to the prey. When the web spider Zosis genicularis is busy wrapping up its own prey and is less aware of other predators, P. fimbriata uses this activity <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>type</b> of smokescreen to approach the web spider.|$|E
5|$|Metallic bonding can be {{classified}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>type</b> of covalent bonding for which the constituent atoms of the same type and do not combine with one another to form a chemical bond. Atoms will lose an electron(s) forming an array of positive ions. These electrons are shared by the lattice which makes the electron cluster mobile, as the electrons are free to move {{as well as the}} ions. For this, it gives metals their relatively high thermal and electrical conductivity as well as being characteristically ductile.|$|E
