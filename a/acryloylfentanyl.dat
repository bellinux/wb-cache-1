50|$|Acrylfentanyl (also {{known as}} <b>acryloylfentanyl)</b> {{is a highly}} potent opioid {{analgesic}} that is an analog of fentanyl and has been sold online as a designer drug. In animal studies the IC50 or half maximal inhibitory concentration for acrylfentanyl to displace naloxone is 1.4 nM, being slightly more potent than fentanyl itself (1.6 nM) as well as having a longer duration of action.|$|E
40|$|EMCDDA Risk Assessments are {{publications}} {{examining the}} health and social risks of individual new psychoactive substances. This publication presents the data and findings of the risk assessment on N-(1 ‑phenethylpiperidin- 4 -yl) -N-phenylacrylamide (<b>acryloylfentanyl),</b> {{carried out by the}} extended Scientific Committee of the EMCDDA on 22 February 2017. On the basis of the Risk Assessment Report — and on the initiative of the European Commission — on 25 September 2017, the Council decided that <b>acryloylfentanyl</b> should be subject to control measures across the Member States. <b>Acryloylfentanyl</b> is known from the scientific literature and is a close structural relative of fentanyl. Fentanyl is a fast but short-acting synthetic opioid.

40|$|The {{abuse of}} novel psychoactive {{substances}} (NPS) {{has been increasing}} dramatically worldwide since late 2000 s. By the end of 2015, more than 560 NPS had been reported to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. Although the most popular compounds are synthetic cannabinoids and psychostimulatory derivatives of cathinone (so-called β-keto-amphetamines), novel synthetic opioids have recently emerged on the recreational drug market. They include fentanyl (a potent narcotic analgesic) and its analogs (e. g., acetylfentanyl, <b>acryloylfentanyl,</b> carfentanil, α-methylfentanyl, 3 -methylfentanyl, furanylfentanyl, 4 -fluorobutyrylfentanyl, 4 -methoxybutyrylfentanyl, 4 -chloroisobutyrylfentanyl, 4 -fluoroisobutyrylfentanyl, tetrahydrofuranylfentanyl, cyclopentylfentanyl, and ocfentanil) and compounds with different chemical structures, such as AH- 7921, MT- 45, and U- 47700. This survey {{provides an overview of}} the pharmacological properties, pattern of use, and desired and unwanted effects of the above-listed novel opioids. Special emphasis is given to cases of non-fatal and lethal intoxication involving these compounds...|$|E
