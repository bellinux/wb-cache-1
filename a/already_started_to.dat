5|$|When the Swedish invaded Zealand in August 1658, the Dutch Republic was not {{the only}} foreign power that took notice. A union between Brandenburg, Poland and Austria had <b>already</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> put {{together}} a relief army in December 1657, but preparations of the polyglot force took so long that the Treaty of Roskilde was signed before the army was ready to march. However, the preparations were not in vain—with the 1658 invasion the allies were in an excellent position to quickly put together a force and march towards Denmark.|$|E
5|$|In January 2009 the Chancellor {{announced}} an Asset Purchase Facility (APF), {{to be administered}} by the MPC, aimed at ensuring greater liquidity in financial markets. The committee had <b>already</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> cut rates the previous autumn, but the effect of such changes {{can take up to}} two years and rates cannot go below zero. By March 2009, faced with very low levels on inflation and interest rates already at 0.5%, the MPC voted to start the process of quantitative easing (QE) – the injection of money directly into the economy – via the APF. It had the Bank buy government bonds (gilts), along with a smaller amount of high-quality debt issued by private companies. Although non-gilts initially made up a non-negligible part of the APF portfolio, as of May 2015 the entirety of the APF was held as gilts. On 7 August 2013, Governor Mark Carney issued the committee's first forward guidance as a third tool for controlling future inflation.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, the Afro's {{popularity}} among African Americans had <b>already</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> wane {{by the early}} 1970s; {{the introduction of the}} Afro to the mainstream and its adoption by people of non-African descent caused the Afro to lose its radical, political edge. The 1970s saw an increase in the popularity of braided hairstyles such as cornrows among both sexes of African Americans.|$|E
25|$|The LMS {{inherited}} {{a wide variety}} of passenger rolling stock from its constituent companies, and appointed Robert Whyte Reid, and ex-Midland Railway man, as the head of its Carriage department. Reid had <b>already</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> introduce more efficient carriage building practices at the Derby Carriage and Wagon works of the Midland Railway prior to grouping and these same practices were soon introduced to the carriage and wagon works of the former LNWR at Wolverton and the L at Newton Heath.|$|E

25|$|Murray did {{suggest the}} {{possibility}} of releasing modding tools for Windows players to alter the game, though noted {{that they would be}} limited, and would not allow players to create new planets in the game, for example. About a week after the Windows release players had <b>already</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> examine the game's files and create unofficial mods, with at least one mod-sharing website offering these for distribution. Hello Games have since provided patches that help to support these user mods.|$|E
25|$|In December 1953 Blair, {{playing for}} New Zealand against South Africa at Johannesburg, {{received}} news that his fiancée, Nerissa Love, {{had been killed}} in the Tangiwai railway disaster on Christmas Eve. Blair was not expected to bat when his turn came on Boxing Day, as an announcement had been made that he would take no further part in the game. In the event, however, he appeared at the crease to join Bert Sutcliffe, who had <b>already</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> walk off the field. The packed crowd stood in silence.|$|E
25|$|Olavi Paavolainen {{was born}} in Kivennapa, Carelia, in the Grand Duchy of Finland in 1903. Paavolainen descended {{from a family of}} civil {{servants}} and soldiers. His father, Pietari (Pekka) Paavolainen, was a lawyer and Member of Parliament and his mother was named Alice Laura (Löfgrén). In 1914, he moved to Helsinki where he started to write poems already at the age of twelve. He later studied aesthetics and literature at the University of Helsinki from 1921 to 1925, but without graduating. While studying at the university, Paavolainen <b>already</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> publish critics and poems.|$|E

25|$|In 1929, aged 15, he was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis although he made a recovery from it after spending three months on the west coast of Jutland. By the age of 16 he was influenced by N. F. S. Grundtvig, and although he had <b>already</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> paint, Asger enrolled in the Vinthers Seminarium, a teacher training college in Silkeborg where he paid particular attention to a course in 19th century Scandinavian thought. Also at about this time Jorn became the subject of a number of oil paintings by the painter Martin Kaalund-Jørgensen, which encouraged Jorn to try his hand in this medium.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the signing}} of the armistice, Austrian General Weber {{informed}} his Italian counterparts that the Imperial army had already laid down its weapons, due to a previous order and requested combat and Italian advancement to cease. The Italian General Pietro Badoglio sharply rejected the proposal, and threatened to stop all negotiations and continue the war. General Weber repeated the request, with no results. Even before the order to cease hostilities, the Imperial Army had <b>already</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> collapse, ceasing to exist as a combat force. Italian troops continued their advance until 3.00 p.m. on November 4. The occupation of all Tyrol, including Innsbruck, was completed in the days that followed.|$|E
25|$|The band first hired Midlands bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes, {{formerly}} of Trapeze. According to Ian Paice, Glover {{had told him}} and Lord {{a few months before}} his official resignation that he wanted to leave the band, so they had <b>already</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> drop in on Trapeze shows. After acquiring Hughes, they debated continuing as a four-piece band, with Hughes as both bassist and lead vocalist. According to Hughes, he was persuaded to join under the guise that the band would be bringing in Paul Rodgers of Free as a co-lead vocalist, but by that time Rodgers had just started Bad Company. Instead, auditions were held for lead vocal replacements. They settled on David Coverdale, an unknown singer from Saltburn in Northeast England, primarily because Blackmore liked his masculine, blues-tinged voice.|$|E
50|$|As {{with earlier}} volumes, {{it is not}} always clear what is contrived. Illustratively, Milligan quotes two diary sentences, then expands them into a page of {{description}} (pp. 268-9). Other inserts are definitely contrived, such as quoting Hitler, “'You see, you Russian fools? Zey are <b>already</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> like back us Germans!'” (p. 100).|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} {{passed into}} the hands of Indiana University, which continued to use part of Seaman Hall as a satellite campus, but nothing was done with the church itself.

In Valkenswaard engineers were moved up to construct a 190 foot m Class 40 Bailey bridge over a stream, which was completed within 12 hours.|$|R
25|$|The Jesuits {{were also}} {{very active in}} {{transmitting}} Chinese knowledge to Europe, such as translating Confucius's works into European languages. Ricci in his De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas had <b>already</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> report on the thoughts of Confucius; he (and, earlier, Michele Ruggieri) made attempts at translating the Four Books, the standard introduction into the Confucian canon. The work on the Confucian classics by several generations of Jesuits culminated with Fathers Philippe Couplet, Prospero Intorcetta, et al. publishing Confucius Sinarum Philosophus ("Confucius, the Philosopher of the Chinese") in Paris in 1687. The book contained an annotated Latin translation {{of three of the}} Four Books and a biography of Confucius. It is thought that such works had considerable importance on European thinkers of the period, particularly those who were interested in the integration of the Confucian system of morality into Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Gregory next {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Germany. In 718, he was approached by an Anglo-Saxon missionary, Winfrid, who proposed undertaking missionary work in Germany. Gregory agreed, and after changing his name to Boniface, commissioned him in May 719 to preach in Germany. After hearing of the work that had been done so far, in 722 Gregory summoned Boniface back to Rome to answer rumours concerning Boniface’s doctrinal purity. Interestingly, at this face to face meeting, Boniface complained that he found Gregory’s Latin difficult to understand, a clear indication that Vulgar Latin had <b>already</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> evolve into the Romance languages. After examining Boniface’s written profession of faith, Gregory was satisfied enough that he made Boniface a bishop in November 722, and returned him to Germany to continue his mission. Continued successes saw Gregory write to Boniface in December 724 to offer his congratulations, followed in November 726 by a response to Boniface’s questions about how to structure the newly emergent churches in Germany.|$|E
25|$|Noticing {{that all}} sinkholes are connected, {{they come to}} the {{conclusion}} that the biggest hydra must be in the center, laying the eggs that hatch into the smaller hydras who wander through the tunnels. They notice that the giants are all going to meet that alpha hydra, and Jack Junior leaves to go kill it, followed by the children. There, they meet the giant multi-headed dragon, who had <b>already</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> kill the giants that had gathered to fight it. After hurting Jack Junior and the Grace kids, Nick has an idea and realizes it's up to him to save the day. Using the cap given to him by the merfolk so he could safely breathe, he goes into one of the tunnels with Jack's machete so to meet the hydra from below. When he gets there, instead of trying to kill the beast, he cuts the substance that keeps all the dragons together, thus making them separate from each other and easier for the giants to kill.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the early}} 19th century, Brixton {{was part of}} the parish of St Mary-at-Lambeth, whose ancient parish church stood about 3 mi away, next to Lambeth Palace. These {{arrangements}} were inconvenient for those living in the new housing that was <b>already</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> appear along the main roads passing through Brixton, a situation that was addressed by the construction of St Matthew's.|$|R

At that point, it ranked among the nation's top 100 department stores.|$|R
25|$|The 205th Motorized Division {{deployed}} forward {{under attack}} from German aircraft {{on the morning of}} 22 June. The 30th Tank Division's 61st Tank Regiment concentrated west of Pruzhany by 0900. The division formed two columns, reinforced by artillery. The German artillery bombardment on the morning of 22 June destroyed much of the 22nd Tank Division's fuel, supplies, and ammunition at Brest. Air raids on the corps headquarters destroyed its radio, severing communications. Oborin moved the command post to the prearranged location in the forest around Tevli. As a result of the loss of communications, the corps was not alerted until German troops had <b>already</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> cross the Bug River. A tank battalion from the 22nd Tank Division was sent towards the river and was unable to stop the crossing. By the end of the morning, the combat units of the two tank divisions were around Zhabinka. At 1200, the 30th Tank Division sent a tank regiment into a counterattack against German amphibious tanks crossing the Lesnaya River to the north of Brest, which was repulsed by German air attacks. Oborin put the 14th Mechanized Corps on the defensive and ordered a counterattack with the entire corps the next morning. Attacking on the morning of 23 June, the 200 T-26s of the 22nd and 30th destroyed numerous German tanks but suffered heavier losses.|$|E
25|$|Petrović quickly {{noticed that}} Stublić's slight build and running {{efficiency}} made her naturally suited to competing over longer distances, rather than middle-distance events she had focused on. In particular, Stublić had <b>already</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> develop back problems, {{caused by the}} strain of running 3000 meters steeplechase, her favorite event. At first, she was very reserved towards Petrović's suggestion to try the marathon. Still, in December 2008, after only {{three and a half}} months of work with her new coach, she set a national record in half marathon. She was finally convinced only when she tried to run for three straight hours in a training session, and found that it was not as difficult or tedious as she expected. Already the top Croatian female distance runner by the end of 2008, having set the season's best marks in 3000 meters, 3000 meters steeplechase, 5000 meters, 10,000 meters and half marathon, Stublić made an agreement with her coach to maintain the focus on the track events in 2009, but to start preparing for the marathon in the autumn of 2009, with the goal of qualifying for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The 2009 season was successful for Stublić, as she topped the national year rankings in the same five events again, setting national records over 3000 meters steeplechase and 5000 meters in the process.|$|E
25|$|The Bulgarian state {{existed before}} the {{formation}} of the Bulgarian people. Prior to the establishment of the Bulgarian state the Slavs had mingled with the native Thracian population. The population and the density of the settlements increased after 681 and the differences between the individual Slavic tribes gradually disappeared as communications became regular between the regions of the country. By {{the second half of the}} 9th century, Bulgars and Slavs had lived together for almost two centuries and the more numerous Slavs were on the way to assimilate the Bulgars. Many Bulgars had <b>already</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> use the Slavic Old Bulgarian language while the Turkic Bulgar language gradually died out leaving only certain words and terms. The Christianization of Bulgaria and the establishment of Old Bulgarian as a language of the state and the Church under BorisI further accelerated that process and were the main means to bind together Bulgars and Slavs and to make the Slavs of Macedonia and the other reaches of the country into Bulgarians. The new religion dealt a crushing blow on the privileges of the old Bulgar aristocracy and furthermore by that time many Bulgars were presumably speaking Slavic. Boris I made it a national policy to use the doctrine of Christianity, that had neither Slavic or Bulgar origin, to bind them together in a single culture. As a result, by the end of the 9th century the Bulgarians had become a single Slavic nationality with ethnic awareness that was to survive in triumph and tragedy to present.|$|E
