In the present study, we {{examined the effects of}} dizocilpine (0. 1 – 3. 0 mg/kg s. c.) on locomotor activity and on the expression of c-fos and hsp- 70 immediate-early genes (IEGs) in mice. Results indicate that dizocilpine increases locomotor activity and selectively in-creases the expression of c-fos and hsp- 70 in the posterior cin-gulate cortex. Haloperidol (0. 01 – 0. 1 mg/kg) and clozapine (0. 6 – 1. 25 mg/kg) block both the locomotor response and the increased IEG immunoreactivity induced by dizocilpine (0. 6 mg/kg). The 5 -HT 2 antagonists ritanserin (0. 06 – 0. 25 mg/kg), ketanserin (0. 03 – 0. 12 mg/kg) and <b>amesergide</b> (0. 3 – 1. 25 mg/kg) also significantl...|$|E
