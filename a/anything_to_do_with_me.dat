2500|$|During a 2013 {{interview}} with Chicago Pride, on being {{asked if he}} has kept in contact {{with any of the}} other Cobra actors, he replied [...] "No. There were few I was close with - but mostly the civil suit, and the pressure Bryan Kocis put on the other models, not to have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and then Bryan's death pretty much put an end of the friendships I'd garnered there. From what I've heard some have moved on nicely enough. Some aren't even alive anymore. I randomly saw one in a San Francisco gym during Pride a few years ago but thought better of stopping him to say hello. It's a chapter of my life I don't like to revel in." [...] He stated in the interview that the trend in the pornographic industry is toward unprotected, unsafe sex. He has warned about the social impact on gay and bisexual men's decision making, especially when in the heat of lust and passion, while influenced by alcohol or drugs. He appeared in a short interview for his film Big Easy in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of their {{previous}} album, The Real Thing and its subsequent tour, Faith No More took a break {{for a year and a}} half before beginning work on the follow-up, Angel Dust. During this time Mike Patton rejoined his high-school band Mr. Bungle to record their eponymous début album. This situation had an effect on the band, since drummer Mike Bordin thought the writing process was like the state of a [...] "magic slate" [...] having been [...] "completely covered in writing; there was not any more room for any more writing on that slate, so we all went and said all right, and erased everything, and started writing new stuff," [...] and Patton was creatively revitalized. They decided not to [...] "play it safe" [...] and instead took a different musical direction, much to the dismay of guitarist Jim Martin. [...] Martin also didn't like the title of the album as chosen by keyboardist Roddy Bottum. [...] In an interview taken while they were in the studio he said that [...] "Roddy [...] wanted to name it Angel Dust, I don't know why, I just want you to know that if it's named Angel Dust, it didn't have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{experience}} {{was very difficult}} for Foster, and she has rarely commented on it publicly. In the aftermath of the events, she wrote an essay titled Why Me?, which was published by Esquire in 1982 on the condition that [...] "there be no cover lines, no publicity and no photos". In 1991, she cancelled an interview with NBC's Today Show when she discovered Hinckley would be mentioned in the introduction, and the producers were unwilling to change it. She discussed Hinckley with Charlie Rose of 60 Minutes II in 1999, explaining that she does not [...] "like to dwell on it too much [...] I never wanted to be the actress who was remembered for that event. Because it didn't have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I was kind of a hapless bystander. But [...] what a scarring, strange moment in history for me, to be 17 years old, 18 years old, and to be caught up in a drama like that." [...] She stated that the incident had a major impact on career choices she made but acknowledged that as difficult as the ordeal was for her, it was minimal compared to the suffering of Reagan's press secretary James Brady, who was permanently disabled in the shooting and {{died as a result of}} his injuries 33 years later, and his loved ones: [...] "whatever bad moments that I had certainly could never compare to that family".|$|E
