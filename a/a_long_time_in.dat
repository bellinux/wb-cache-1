5|$|The Przeworsk culture, {{named after}} a town in Lesser Poland, near which another burial ground was found, {{originated}} like the Oksywie culture around 250 BC, but lasted <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> its course it went through many changes, formed tribal and political structures, fought wars, also with the Romans, until in the 5th century AD its highly developed society of farmers, artisans, warriors and chiefs left for the temptations of the fallen empire lands (for many of them it happened possibly rather quickly, {{during the first half}} of that century).|$|E
5|$|The {{complete}} {{history of}} Skåneland was not taught for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> schools in Skåneland, especially during periods with the immediate threat of revolt. Instead a Swedish-centric history was taught, and the Scanian history before 1658, for instance concerning {{the list of}} monarchs, was disregarded {{as a component of}} Danish history. In reaction, a movement began in the late 19th century to revive awareness of the history and culture of Skåneland. The renewed focus resulted in the publication of several books about Scanian history.|$|E

5|$|According to Hindu legend, god Vishnu sat in {{meditation}} at this place, keeping {{away from}} Thuling, {{a place in}} the Himalayas which was corrupted by meat-eating monks and unchaste people. During his meditation, Vishnu was unaware of cold weather. Lakshmi, his consort, protected him {{in the form of the}} Badri tree (jujube or Indian date). Pleased by the devotion of Lakshmi, Vishnu named the place Badrika Ashram. According to Atkinson (1979), the place used to be a jujube forest, which are not found there today. Vishnu in the form of Badrinath is depicted in the temple sitting in the padmasana posture. According to the legend, Vishnu was chastised by a sage, who saw Vishnu's consort Lakshmi massaging his feet. Vishnu went to Badrinath to perform austerity, meditating for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> padmasana.|$|E
5|$|Spanish bishops {{also claimed}} that the Government, by {{extending}} the right of marriage to same-sex couples, weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving a heterosexual couple. The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of same-sex couples adopting and raising children, and argued that adoption is not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by same-sex couples had existed for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted {{by one of the}} partners. Adoption by same-sex couples was already legal in Navarre (2000), the Basque Country (2003), Aragon (2004), Catalonia (2005) and Cantabria (2005) before the same-sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide. Furthermore, in Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002) and Extremadura (2003), same-sex couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care. These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their adopted children. This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology, which also states that homosexuality is not a pathology.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Tasci {{attracted}} interest from clubs around Europe. Stuttgart's league rival Hamburger SV as well as foreign clubs such as Tottenham Hotspur and Juventus reportedly expressed their desire to sign him. This move was denied by his agent; he said that Tasci would stay at Stuttgart only. On 15 July 2010, Tasci expressed his desire to stay at the club. After being excluded from the opening game of the season, he made his first appearance in a 3–2 loss against Borussia Dortmund. He scored his first goal for the club in the Europa League group stage matchday one in a 3–0 win over Young Boys. He then suffered a thigh problem that kept him out for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> late November, Tasci returned to training with a bandage on his right knee. Once again, he was on the sideline after experiencing ongoing problems with his thigh injury despite reporting himself fit. He returned to the field on 19 December 2010 in the match against Bayern Munich, which Stuttgart lost 5–3. Despite his injury, Tasci would go on to make 26 league appearances. He continued to attract interest from Zenit Saint Petersburg, Tottenham, Málaga and Arsenal.|$|E
