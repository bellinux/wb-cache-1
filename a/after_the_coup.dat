5|$|The communists {{were pleased}} by the coup, as the South Vietnamese {{military}} was wasting its resources and energy on infighting. They did not make any attacks in the days immediately <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> as they were worried their doing so might galvanize the divided society into action against a common cause.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> and Piłsudski's {{reign as}} dictator, he often clashed with Catholic leaders but nevertheless, enjoyed good working {{relationship}} with Cardinal Aleksander Kakowski, who subsequently led his funeral mass. In 1937, Archbishop of Kraków, Adam Stefan Sapieha, ordered to move Piłsudski's coffin from St. Leonard's Crypt to Royal Tombs at Wawel. This led to open conflict with {{the church and the}} government, which threatened to step down.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> on 1 November 1963, {{in which}} Diệm and Nhu were killed the {{following}} day, Thơ was appointed Prime Minister by Minh's military junta five days later, on 6 November 1963. He {{was the leading}} civilian in the provisional government overseen by the Military Revolutionary Council (MRC). Minh had earlier promised U.S. officials that the civilians would be above the generals in the hierarchy. In addition, he was minister for finance and the economy. Thơ's appointment was not universally popular, with some leading figures privately lobbying for a clean break from the Diệm era.|$|E

5|$|Alphonse Amadou Alley (April 9, 1930 – March 28, 1987) was a Beninese {{army officer}} and {{political}} figure. He was most active when his country {{was known as}} Dahomey. He was born in Bassila, central Dahomey, and enrolled in schools in Togo, Cote d'Ivoire, and Senegal before enlisting in the French army in 1950. He saw combat in Indochina from 1950 to 1953, in Morocco from 1955 to 1956, and in Algeria from 1959 to 1961. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> in 1965, President Christophe Soglo promoted Alley Chief of Staff of the Army. Young army officer Maurice Kouandété was appointed Alley's chef de cabinet in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{involvement}} with the Pinochet government, there were international protests when Friedman was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1976. Friedman was accused of supporting the military dictatorship in Chile because of the relation of economists of the University of Chicago to Pinochet, and a controversial seven-day trip he took to Chile during March 1975 (less than two years <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> that deposed President Salvador Allende). Friedman answered that he never was {{an adviser to the}} dictatorship, but only gave some lectures and seminars on inflation, and met with officials, including Augusto Pinochet, while in Chile.|$|E
5|$|Minh {{was said}} to have been deeply {{affected}} by the loss of his long-time aide, and it was reported that the general erected an altar dedicated to Nhung's memory in his office, with the major's portrait on it. Shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> Khánh made Minh the figurehead head of state under American advice, hoping that the presence of the popular general would help to unify the armed forces, but Minh made little attempt to help Khánh, partly because of resentment over the loss of his aide.|$|E

Amin placed military tribunals above the system of civil law, appointed soldiers to top government posts and parastatal agencies, and informed the newly inducted civilian cabinet ministers that they would be subject to military discipline.|$|E

As many as 1,500 people may have been killed. The AFL was purged of Gio soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Aflaq's {{downfall}} {{caused a}} split within the Ba'ath Party; {{the party was}} de facto dissolved and two Ba'ath Parties were established, one Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party and one Syrian-led Ba'ath Party. The Syrian-led party was led by Jadid and his supporters and hailed Zaki al-Arsuzi, {{the founder of the}} Arab Ba'ath in 1940, as the father of Ba'athist thought, while the Iraqi-led party led by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein, still proclaimed Aflaq to be the founder of Ba'athist thought. In February 1966 at the Ninth National Congress, held <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> which ousted the pro-Aflaq faction, the Iraqi delegation split with the Syrian Ba'athists. The Iraqi's held the true Ninth National Congress in February 1968 in Beirut, and elected Aflaq as Secretary General of the National Command. Aflaq's election to the Secretary Generalship also proved to be his final break with al-Bitar; before the congress convened al-Bitar announced that he had left the Ba'ath Party and given up on the Ba'athist movement as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Desaix’s arrival around 5:30 pm stabilised the French {{position}} as the 9th Light Infantry Regiment delayed the Austrian advance down the main road {{and the rest of}} the army re-formed north of Cascina Grossa. As the pursuing Austrian troops arrived, a mix of musketry and artillery fire concealed the surprise attack of Général de Brigade (GdB) François Étienne de Kellermann’s cavalry, which threw the Austrian pursuit into disordered flight back into Alessandria, with about 14,000 killed, wounded, or captured. The French casualties were considerably fewer, but included Desaix. The whole French line chased after the Austrians to seal une victoire politique (a political victory) that secured Bonaparte’s grip on power <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup.</b> It would be followed by a propaganda campaign, which sought to rewrite the story of the battle three times during Napoleon’s rule.|$|E
5|$|Grigory Orlov, one of Catherine's lovers, led {{a palace}} coup in June 1762 that ousted the Emperor Peter III and enthroned Catherine II. Sergeant Potemkin {{represented}} his regiment in the revolt. Allegedly, as Catherine reviewed her troops {{in front of}} the Winter Palace before their march to the Peterhof, she lacked a sword-knot (or possibly hat plumage), which Potemkin quickly supplied. Potemkin's horse then (appeared to) refuse to leave her side for several minutes before Potemkin and horse returned to the ranks. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> Catherine singled out Potemkin for reward and ensured his promotion to second lieutenant. Though Potemkin was among those guarding the ex-Tsar, it appears that he had no direct involvement in Peter's murder in July. Catherine promoted him again to Kammerjunker (gentleman of the bedchamber), though he retained his post in the Guards. Potemkin was soon formally presented to the Empress as a talented mimic; his imitation of her was well received.|$|E
5|$|Immediately <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> {{officers}} {{loyal to}} Umran and the Aflaqites were purged from the armed forces, being imprisoned alongside Umran at Mezze prison. One {{of the first}} acts of Jadid's government was to appoint Assad Minister of Defence. Assad however, {{did not support the}} coup, and told Mansur al-Atrash, Jubran Majdalani, and other Aflaqites that he did not support Jadid's actions. Later, in an interview with Le Monde, Assad claimed that the military's intervention was regrettable because the Ba'ath Party was democratic, and that the disputes should have been resolved in a democratic manner. However, Assad did view the actions as necessary, as it put an end, in his view, to the dictatorship of the National Command.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Santiago's {{military}} prosecutor {{prohibited the}} unmarked bodies from being incinerated or removed, though Walkowitz and Knauer wrote in Memory and the Impact of Political Transformation in Public Space {{that the military}} government dug up and hid hundreds of these bodies in 1982. Following the end of military rule and return of democracy to Chile in 1990, investigation of human rights violations became a top priority. Though a 1978 amnesty decree prevented prosecution for pre-1978 offenses, the new Aylwin government sought disclosure of the truth and recompense for the victim's families and appointed a National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation. The commission's February 1991 Rettig Report named victims disappeared shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> executed by gunshot, and presumed {{to be buried in}} Patio 29.

5|$|Phát {{and other}} pro-Diệm {{officers}} opposed the Buddhist influence being exerted on Khánh. Thảo consulted Kỳ—who wanted to seize power for himself—before the plot, and exhorted {{him to join}} the coup, but the air force chief claimed that he was remaining neutral. Thảo thus believed Kỳ would not intervene against him, but Kỳ was strongly opposed to Thảo and Phát. American intelligence analysts had believed that General Don {{was involved in the}} coup with Phát and Thảo, but this was proven false when the action started. Eight months <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> was over, Don told the American historian George McTurnan Kahin that he had been plotting with Thảo, who had planned for him to become Defense Minister and Chief of Staff of the military, but that the Đại Việt and Thảo's Catholic civilian allies had insisted on installing Khiêm, a Catholic. A month before the coup, American intelligence analysts had believed that Thảo was planning to replace Khánh as commander-in-chief with Don.|$|E
5|$|Two of Rainilaiarivony's cousins {{urged him}} to take his elder brother's place in order to end the shame that Rainivoninahitriniony's {{behavior}} was bringing upon their family. After weighing the idea, Rainilaiarivony approached Rasoherina with the proposal. The queen readily consented and lent her assistance in rallying {{the support of the}} nobles at court. On 14 July 1864, {{little more than a year}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> Rasoherina deposed and divorced Rainivoninahitriniony, then exiled the fallen minister the following year. Rainilaiarivony was promoted to Prime Minister. The arrangement was sealed when Rainilaiarivony took Rasoherina as his bride and demoted his longtime spouse Rasoanalina to the status of second wife. Rainilaiarivony confided in a friend shortly before his death that he deeply loved his first wife and came to share the same degree of feeling toward Rasoherina as well, but never developed the same affection for the subsequent queens he married. None of his royal spouses bore him any children.|$|E

5|$|While it {{planned the}} coup, the {{military}} committee {{and its members}} were frowned upon by civilian Ba'athists. The reason for the army–party alliance {{in the first place}} was to safeguard the party from repression. The military committee did not look favourably on the civilian leadership led by Michel Aflaq, objecting to his dissolution the Ba'ath Party during the UAR years. While Aflaq needed the military committee to seize power, the committee needed Aflaq to hold on power – without Aflaq they would have no support base. At the 5th National Ba'ath Party Congress, held on 8 May 1962, it was decided to reestablish the party and keep Aflaq as Secretary General of the National Command. Muhammad Umran, a leading member of the military committee, was a delegate at the 5th National Congress, and told Aflaq of the military committee's intentions – Aflaq consented to the coup, but no agreement was made between him and the committee on how to share power <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the Diệm era, the VNQDD were {{implicated in}} two failed coup attempts. In November 1960, a paratrooper revolt failed after the mutineers agreed to negotiate, {{allowing}} time for loyalists {{to relieve the}} president. Many of the officers involved had links to or {{were members of the}} VNQDD, and fled the country <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> collapsed. In 1963, VNQDD leaders Tam and Vũ Hồng Khanh were among those arrested for their involvement in the plot; Tam committed suicide before the case started, and Khanh was jailed. In February 1962, two Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots, Nguyễn Văn Cừson of a prominent VNQDD leaderand Phạm Phú Quốc, bombarded the Independence Palace in a bid to kill the president and his family, but their targets escaped unharmed. Diem was eventually deposed in a military coup and killed in November 1963. While the generals that led the coup were not members of the VNQDD, they sought to cultivate ARVN officers who were part of the VNQDD because of their antipathy towards Diem.|$|E
5|$|The revolt {{was led by}} 28-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Vương Văn Đông, a northerner, who {{had fought}} with the French Union forces against the Viet Minh during the First Indochina War. Later trained at Fort Leavenworth in the United States, Đông was {{regarded}} by American military advisers as a brilliant tactician and the brightest military prospect of his generation and {{he served in the}} Airborne Division. Back in Vietnam, Đông became discontented with Diệm's arbitrary rule and constant meddling {{in the internal affairs of}} the army. Diệm promoted officers on loyalty rather than skill, and played senior officers against one another in order to weaken the military leadership and prevent them from challenging his rule. Years <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> Đông asserted that his sole objective was to force Diệm to improve the governance of the country. Đông was clandestinely supported by his brother-in-law Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Trieu Hong, the director of training at the Joint General Staff School, and Hong's uncle Hoang Co Thuy. Thuy was a wealthy Saigon-based lawyer, and had been a political activist since World War II. He was the secretary-general of a minority opposition party called the Movement of Struggle for Freedom, which had a small presence in the rubber-stamp National Assembly.|$|E
