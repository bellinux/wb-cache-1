40|$|The problem. A. Numerous {{articles}} and theoretical essays {{have been written}} since 1965 regarding <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> for inner-city populations. B. Funds from various agencies have been alloted for <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> in large cities. In public school settings {{and outside of the}} public school domain <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> have been implemented. Although single program outcomes appear in literature, no major compilation of data has been made, which provides insight or an overview of the entire scope of <b>art</b> <b>programming</b> within a given location or comparing <b>art</b> <b>programming</b> of one city to another. Procedure. Correspondence was made to cities selected for this study as well as to Federal and state institutions for information regarding <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> and curricula. Findings. The findings are based on responses to two questions: 1. How do <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> in the Des Moines area com-pare with <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> that exist in some major cities across the U. S. ? 2. Based upon research and recent literature, do <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> in the Des Moines area and across the country meet the needs of inner-city children? It was found that <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> in Des Moines do com-pare favorably with inner-city programs in some major cities. It also was found that most <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> in Des Moines and other major cities, have a distinct weakness in meeting the needs of inner-city children. Conclusion. It was concluded that the strengths of <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> warrant some merit, but the weaknesses, based upon a lack of change, present a cause for major concern. Recommendations. Three alternatives were recommended: (I) the establ:ishrnent of a Black Art and Culture Center in Des Moines, Iowa, (2) the adoption of an Art Action Center in the Des Moines Public Schools, and (3) the development in the Des Moines inner-city schoolS of a new approach to teaching inner-city children through a coordinated art curriculum...|$|R
