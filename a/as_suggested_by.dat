5|$|Manuel's career under Leo's successor, Michael II the Amorian (r. 820–829), is unclear, {{as he is}} not {{mentioned}} in the sources during this period. Certainly {{at the time of the}} outbreak of the great rebellion of Thomas the Slav, the strategos of the Armeniacs was Olbianos, while the Anatolics joined the rebellion. Manuel himself, however, evidently remained loyal to Michael, and it was probably the latter who raised him to the rank of magistros. The editors of the Prosopographie der mittelbyzantinischen Zeit suggest that Manuel may have been recalled by Michael to Constantinople, especially if the marriage of Michael's son and heir Theophilos (r. 829–842) and Manuel's niece Theodora took place around 821, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> E.W. Brooks, and not around 830, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> Treadgold.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} sibling of Nyuserre is known with near-certainty: Neferefre, {{who was a}} son of Neferirkare and Khentkaus II, was Nyuserre's elder brother. Since the {{relation}} between Shepseskare and Nyuserre remains uncertain, {{it is possible that}} the two were brothers too, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> Roth, although the dominant hypothesis is that Shepseskare was a son of Sahure and hence Nyuserre's uncle.|$|E

5|$|During {{the march}} to Kediri, the Mataram–VOC army purposefully split {{itself and the}} columns took different, {{indirect}} routes to Kediri, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> Amangkurat. This enabled the army to meet more factions and to win over those with wavering allegiance. The army marched through areas previously unexplored by the Dutch. The Dutch account was recorded in a journal by Hurdt's secretary Johan Jurgen Briel. Accounts of the campaign also appear in babads (Javanese chronicles).|$|E

Electrocardiography (ECG) may show whether the elevated potassium levels are affecting the conduction system of the heart, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> the presence of T wave changes or broadening of the QRS complex. Low calcium levels may be present in the initial stage due to binding of free calcium to damaged muscle cells.|$|E

Leonard later presented the instrumental to Madonna, who decided {{to use it for}} At Close Range, the new film starring her then-husband, actor Sean Penn. Madonna wrote all the lyrics, added some melodies to the composition, and recorded a demo on a cassette. She presented the track to the film's director James Foley, who liked it and enlisted Leonard to compose the film's score, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> Madonna.|$|E
5|$|In the late-13th century, many of {{the newly}} {{emerging}} painter's guilds were nominating Luke as their patron saint. The van der Weyden panel is among the first known depictions of St Luke painting the Virgin in Northern Renaissance art, along with a similar work, a lost triptych panel by Robert Campin. Van der Weyden presents a humanised Virgin and Child, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> the realistic contemporary surroundings, the lack of halos, and the intimate spatial construction. Yet he infuses the panel with extensive religious iconography.|$|E

5|$|The {{allotetraploid}} hybrid species {{derived from}} A.montanum can backcross with A.montanum to form triploid hybrids. The backcross hybrid between A.montanum and A.pinnatifidum is A.×trudellii, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> Wherry. He also collected specimens of the backcross hybrid between A.montanum and A.bradleyi from a cliff near Blairstown, New Jersey in 1935. The hybrid received no further attention until 1961, {{when it was}} described and named in Wherry's honor as Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi). The sterile diploid A.montanum × platyneuron, precursor to A.bradleyi, was collected in 1972 at Crowder's Mountain, Georgia; A.montanum × rhizophyllum, precursor to A.pinnatifidum, has never been found.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} on the convergence of prices in the eurozone {{with the introduction of}} the euro is mixed. Several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s. Other studies have found evidence of price convergence, in particular for cars. A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear, slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and resurfacing after 2003 <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> a recent study (2009).|$|E
5|$|At {{an early}} stage, in {{documents}} {{written in the}} paleo-Hebrew script, words were divided by short vertical lines and later by dots, as reflected by the Mesha Stone, the Siloam inscription, the Ophel inscription, and paleo-Hebrew script documents from Qumran. Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions; however, there is not direct evidence for biblical texts being written without word division, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> Nahmanides {{in his introduction to}} the Torah. Word division using spaces was commonly used {{from the beginning of the}} 7th century BCE for documents in the Aramaic script. In addition to marking vowels, the Tiberian system also uses cantillation marks, which serve to mark word stress, semantic structure, and the musical motifs used in formal recitation of the text.|$|E

5|$|By the 1990s, the Federal {{government}} had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial {{decision by the}} U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (which oversees threatened and endangered species), northwestern wolves imported from Canada were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> the substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 1995–96. The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that on February 27, 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 a {{political}} crisis emerged in Poland {{with the emergence}} of the Solidarity mass movement. By the end of October, Solidarity had 3 million members, and by December, had 9 million. In a public opinion poll organised by the Polish government, 89% of the respondents supported Solidarity. With the Polish leadership split on what to do, the majority did not want to impose martial law, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> Wojciech Jaruzelski. The Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc was unsure how to handle the situation, but Erich Honecker of East Germany pressed for military action. In a formal letter to Brezhnev, Honecker proposed a joint military measure to control the escalating problems in Poland. A CIA report suggested the Soviet military were mobilising for an invasion.|$|E
5|$|Krause {{wrote that}} UA 8699 {{was the first}} {{marsupial}} to be identified from Madagascar and the first from the Mesozoic of any part of Gondwana. Marsupials {{date back to the}} Eocene in Australia and Africa and to the Paleocene in South America; although Cretaceous marsupials have been recorded there, none of the records are unambiguous. Marsupials were certainly present in the Northern Hemisphere during the late Cretaceous. He interpreted UA 8699 as evidence that marsupials must already have colonized the southern continents by the late Cretaceous, presumably having reached Madagascar through South America and Antarctica. By the late Cretaceous, boreosphenidans must already have been in the process of replacing archaic mammals like gondwanatheres on the southern continents, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>by</b> the presence of Deccanolestes, a placental, in the Cretaceous of India.|$|E
