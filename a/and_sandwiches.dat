Many of the regular-sized pasta dishes exceed 1,000 calories, but smaller portions with under 500 calories are available for some dishes. Noodles and Company offers dishes made with gluten-free and vegan ingredients, but warns that cross-contamination may occur.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{customer}} {{demand for}} the product, another major reason for the reintroduction was due to a significant rise {{in the cost of}} beef. During the previous few {{months leading up to the}} reintroduction of Chicken Fries, the available cattle stocks had declined since the USDA began record keeping in 1973. This shortage of ground beef caused a spike in the price of beef to all-time highs in June 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, increasing competition from McDonald's, Wendy's and other chains in the fast food industry drove Burger King to boost sales by introducing new products along similar lines. Two major competitors had been revamping their menus with products such as variations on the McDouble from McDonald's <b>and</b> <b>sandwiches</b> based on pretzel-style buns from Wendy's.|$|E
5|$|Burger King {{introduced}} the Specialty Sandwich line under its Burger King and I promotional campaign {{developed by the}} J. Walter Thompson (JWT) agency. The advertisements featured customers and employees praising the new sandwiches accompanied with {{a brief description of}} the products being sold. Actor Stuart Pankin played a doorman in one commercial in the series. Another one of the promotions used was a scratch card game called What's my Specialty? where the customer would receive a card with their purchase in which they would have to match famous people to said person's profession. The commercial explained that if you expected to lose, you would be disappointed, as all cards were winners. Prizes included fries, sodas <b>and</b> <b>sandwiches.</b>|$|E

The British Columbia Safety Council states that if proper food safety procedures are not followed, food set out for sharing in the workplace can serve as a breeding ground for bacteria, and recommends that perishable foods (for which it gives pizza, cold cuts, dips, salads, <b>and</b> <b>sandwiches</b> as examples) should not sit out for more than 2 hours.|$|E
25|$|Häagen-Dazs's founder Reuben Mattus {{was born}} in Poland in 1912 to Jewish parents. His father died during the First World War, and his widowed mother emigrated to New York City with her two {{children}} in 1921.

By the late 1920s, the family began making ice pops, and by 1929, chocolate-covered ice cream bars <b>and</b> <b>sandwiches</b> under the name Senator Frozen Products on Southern Boulevard in the South Bronx, delivering them with a horse-drawn wagon to neighborhood stores in the Bronx.|$|E
25|$|In May 2008, {{a branch}} of Starbucks was {{completed}} on St. James's Street in Kemptown, Brighton, England, despite having been refused permission by the local planning authority, Brighton and Hove City Council, who claimed {{there were too many}} coffee shops already present on the street. Starbucks appealed the decision by claiming it was a retail store selling bags of coffee, mugs, <b>and</b> <b>sandwiches,</b> gaining a six-month extension, but the council ordered Starbucks to remove all tables and chairs from the premises, to comply with planning regulations for a retail shop. 2500 residents signed a petition against the store, but after a public inquiry in June 2009, a government inspector gave permission for the store to remain.|$|E

25|$|In Mexico and Central America, {{avocados}} {{are served}} mixed with white rice, in soups, salads, {{or on the}} side of chicken and meat. In Peru, they are consumed with tequeños as mayonnaise, served as a side dish with parrillas, used in salads <b>and</b> <b>sandwiches,</b> or as a whole dish when filled with tuna, shrimp, or chicken. In Chile, it is used as a puree-like sauce with chicken, hamburgers, and hot dogs; and in slices for celery or lettuce salads. The Chilean version of Caesar salad contains large slices of mature avocado. In Kenya and Nigeria, the avocado is often eaten as a fruit eaten alone or mixed with other fruits in a fruit salad, or as part of a vegetable salad.|$|E
25|$|Its {{primary use}} is as feed for high-producing dairy cows, {{because of its}} high protein content and highly {{digestible}} fiber, and secondarily for beef cattle, horses, sheep, and goats. Alfalfa hay is a widely used protein and fiber source for meat rabbits. In poultry diets, dehydrated alfalfa and alfalfa leaf concentrates are used for pigmenting eggs and meat, because of their high content in carotenoids, which are efficient for colouring egg yolk and body lipids. Humans also eat alfalfa sprouts in salads <b>and</b> <b>sandwiches.</b> Dehydrated alfalfa leaf is commercially available as a dietary supplement in several forms, such as tablets, powders and tea. Fresh alfalfa can cause bloating in livestock, so {{care must be taken}} with livestock grazing on alfalfa because of this hazard.|$|E
25|$|Chives have a {{wide variety}} of culinary uses, such as in {{traditional}} dishes in France, Sweden, and elsewhere. In his 1806 book Attempt at a Flora (Försök til en flora), Retzius describes how chives are used with pancakes, soups, fish, <b>and</b> <b>sandwiches.</b> They are also an ingredient of the gräddfil sauce with the traditional herring dish served at Swedish midsummer celebrations. The flowers may also be used to garnish dishes. In Poland and Germany, chives are served with quark cheese. Chives are one of the fines herbes of French cuisine, the others being tarragon, chervil and parsley. Chives can be found fresh at most markets year-round, making them readily available; they can also be dry-frozen without much impairment to the taste, giving home growers the opportunity to store large quantities harvested from their own gardens.|$|E

25|$|The concept itself {{consisted}} of pre-packed meals or snacks — usually, Spam salads out <b>and</b> <b>sandwiches</b> back — loaded into a small, two-shelf compartment {{in the seat}} back {{in front of each}} passenger. The meal/snack for the outbound journey could be found in the top compartment, the one for the return trip in the lower section. The latter contained a pellet of dry ice placed under the plastic food container. This simple refrigeration technique prevented food for the return trip that would spend several hours inside a small, confined space from going off. For the airline's cabin staff, it eliminated handling trays while airborne and resulted in a reduction of their workload. To prevent outbound passengers from consuming meals intended for return passengers, locks needed to be installed on the lower compartment that could only be opened by cabin staff during the aircraft's turnaround at the destination airport (although these were not always effective at deterring determined passengers).|$|E

500|$|Seacole's {{recognition}} {{has been}} controversial. It {{has been argued}} that she has been promoted at the expense of Florence Nightingale, and in an attempt to promote multiculturalism. Professor Lynn McDonald has written that [...] "...support for Seacole has been used to attack Nightingale's reputation as a pioneer in public health and nursing." [...] There was opposition to the siting of a statue of Mary Seacole at St Thomas' Hospital on the grounds that she had no connection with this institution, whereas Florence Nightingale did. Dr Sean Lang has stated that she [...] "does not qualify as a mainstream figure in the history of nursing", while a letter to The Times from the Florence Nightingale Society and signed by members including historians and biographers asserted that [...] "Seacole's battlefield excursions ... took place post-battle, after selling wine <b>and</b> <b>sandwiches</b> to spectators. Mrs Seacole was a kind and generous businesswoman, but was not a frequenter of the battlefield [...] "under fire" [...] or a pioneer of nursing." ...|$|E
500|$|Blake {{began the}} 1950 season with Syracuse Chiefs and {{spent most of}} the season as a {{starting}} pitcher instead of a reliever. He started in 23 games and finished the season with a 12–8 record and an ERA of 3.51. In 1951, Blake was considered to have a small chance to make the major league roster. Nonetheless, Blake got his first taste of the major leagues that season. He made his major league debut on May 1, 1951 against the Philadelphia Phillies. Blake played three games during his time on the Reds in 1951, and finished two of those games. He pitched four innings, allowing five runs and three home runs, finishing the season with an ERA of 11.25. While on the Reds in 1951, he was part of a Reds [...] "bullpen union" [...] led by Jim Blackburn, which drew up a series of humorous requests including a smoking lounge <b>and</b> <b>sandwiches</b> between double headers. He spent most of the 1951 season with the Columbus Red Birds, playing in 27 games for them. In 27 pitching appearances, 23 of them starts, Blake went 7–15 with a 5.91 ERA. Despite the record, Blake led the Red Birds in innings pitched and finished tied for second in wins, though he did also lead the team, which went 53–101, in losses.|$|E
