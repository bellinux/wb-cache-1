5|$|For free {{entertainment}} one can stroll along Strøget, especially between Nytorv and Højbro Plads, {{which in}} the late afternoon and evening is <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> an impromptu three-ring circus with musicians, magicians, jugglers and other street performers.|$|E
5|$|While {{the stars}} are fixed to their declinations the Sun is not. The rising point of the Sun varies {{throughout}} the year. It swings between two limits marked by the solstices <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> a pendulum, slowing as it reaches the extremes, but passing rapidly through the midpoint. If an archaeoastronomer can calculate from the azimuth and horizon height that a site was built to view a declination of +23.5° then he or she need not wait until 21 June to confirm the site does indeed face the summer solstice. For more information see History of solar observation.|$|E
5|$|Madonna looks both {{older and}} younger than she does in the photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. She seems up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her {{the air of a}} prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but is certainly beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview. If you saw her in the street, you'd think: she looks like a girl who looks <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> Madonna.|$|E
5000|$|Daryl Surrat of Otaku USA {{magazine}} {{refers to}} Part 4 as the [...] "grand unification of Lupin styles" [...] due to combining elements from several different eras of the franchise; [...] "a <b>bit</b> dangerous <b>like</b> the originals, <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> silly <b>like</b> the 1980s 'pink jacket' Lupin, <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> bizarre <b>like</b> The Woman Called Fujiko Mine, <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> 'gentleman thief {{with a heart}} of gold' like Hayao Miyazaki's Cagliostro interpretation." ...|$|R

25|$|The goal of {{veterinary}} surgery {{may be quite}} different in pets and in farm animals. In the former, situation is <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> in human beings, {{and more and more}} complex operations are performed, with sophisticated anaesthesia techniques. In the latter, the cost of the operation must not exceed the economic benefit in surgically treating the illness.|$|E
25|$|It was the first, {{and to this}} point, {{only time}} a Japanese driver has won a CART-sanctioned event. Those seven laps in front {{were the only ones}} Noda led all year. Despite his winning performance, he was never on the Champ Car {{shopping}} lists, and by 1998 the American adventure was looking <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> a dead end.|$|E
25|$|After new {{segments}} of rail are laid, or defective rails replaced (welded-in), the rails can be artificially stressed if {{the temperature of}} the rail during laying is cooler than what is desired. The stressing process involves either heating the rails, causing them to expand, or stretching the rails with hydraulic equipment. They are then fastened (clipped) to the sleepers in their expanded form. This process ensures that the rail will not expand much further in subsequent hot weather. In cold weather the rails try to contract, but because they are firmly fastened, cannot do so. In effect, stressed rails are <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> a piece of stretched elastic firmly fastened down.|$|E

25|$|The 200 to 350foot (60 to 105m) thick Brushy Basin Member is {{composed}} of claystone, mudstone, and siltstone with small amounts of conglomerate and sandstone. Clays in this member are rich in smectite and thus tend to swell when wet and dry to a crumbled surface that looks <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> popcorn. Fossilized dinosaur bones are abundant in this member in several places located in Utah and western Colorado. The bones are usually scattered and are thus hard to identify but nearly complete skeletons {{have been found in}} lake floor and flood-plain clays. Good exposures of the Brushy Basin Member {{can be seen in the}} Bentonite Hills.|$|E
25|$|Bennett {{was made}} an Honorary Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, in 1987. He was also awarded a D.Litt by the University of Leeds in 1990 and an honorary {{doctorate}} from Kingston University in 1996. In 1998 he refused an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, in protest at its acceptance {{of funding for}} a chair from press baron Rupert Murdoch. He also declined a CBE in 1988 and a knighthood in 1996. He has stated that, although {{he is not a}} republican, he would never wish to be knighted, saying it would be <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> having to wear a suit {{for the rest of his}} life. Bennett earned Honorary Membership of The Coterie in the 2007 membership list.|$|E
25|$|I don't hate Islam. I {{consider}} it a backward culture. I have travelled much in the world. And wherever Islam rules, it's just terrible. All the hypocrisy. It's <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> those old Reformed Protestants. The Reformed lie all the time. And why is that? Because they have standards and values that are so high that you can't humanly maintain them. You also see that in that Muslim culture. Then look at the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement as mine be openly homosexual? How wonderful that that's possible. That's something that one can be proud of. And I'd like {{to keep it that}} way, thank you very much.|$|E

25|$|Tāwari is a {{rich source}} of nectar, which is often so {{abundant}} that bees produce monofloral honey, that is the honey is chiefly made of nectar from Tāwari flowers. Tāwari honey is regularly for sale from food shops in New Zealand. The nectar contains a lot of fructose and much water. The honey may be thin as a consequence, but nonetheless crystallizes quickly. The honey has a light colour and tastes <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> butterscotch. It contains relatively few pollen, and if at least 20% of the pollen is Tāwari, it can be marketed as Tāwari honey. Bark can produce a black dye that is known to be used on flax. Māori people use the flowers to make necklaces and other adornments to be worn at festivities.|$|E
25|$|All unaccented {{letters are}} {{pronounced}} approximately {{as in the}} IPA, {{with the exception of}} c. Esperanto j and c are used in a way familiar to speakers of many European languages, but which is largely unfamiliar to English speakers: j has a y sound , as in yellow and boy, and c has a ts sound , as in hits or the zz in pizza. The accented letters are <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> h-digraphs in English: Ĉ is pronounced like English ch, and ŝ like sh. Ĝ is the g in gem, ĵ a zh sound, as in fusion or French Jacques, and the rare ĥ is like the German , Scottish Gaelic, Scots and Scottish Standard English loch, or how Scouse people sometimes pronounce the 'k' in book and 'ck' in chicken.|$|E
25|$|An older {{method of}} {{harvesting}} {{is to use}} a sweep net, which operates <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> a purse seine net. The sweep net is a big net with weights along the bottom edge. It is stretched across the pen with the bottom edge extending {{to the bottom of the}} pen. Lines attached to the bottom corners are raised, herding some fish into the purse, where they are netted. Before killing, the fish are usually rendered unconscious in water saturated in carbon dioxide, although this practice is being phased out in some countries due to ethical and product quality concerns. More advanced systems use a percussive-stun harvest system that kills the fish instantly and humanely with a blow to the head from a pneumatic piston. They are then bled by cutting the gill arches and immediately immersing them in iced water. Harvesting and killing methods are designed to minimise scale loss, and avoid the fish releasing stress hormones, which negatively affect flesh quality.|$|E

25|$|Following World War II, the character's {{popularity}} {{began to}} fade along with {{the decline of the}} Golden Age of Comic Books, leading to cancellation. After 12 years out of print, DC chose to reinvent Green Lantern as science fiction hero Hal Jordan in 1959. Later, DC would again revisit Alan Scott, establishing that Alan and Hal were the Green Lanterns of two different parallel worlds, with Alan residing on Earth-Two and Hal on Earth-One. Stories set on Earth-Two thereafter showed that Alan became the father to two superheroic children, the twins Obsidian and Jade, each with powers <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> his own. When in 1985 DC chose to reboot its internal continuity, it merged the worlds of Earth-One and Earth-Two, and Alan was again reimagined as an elder statesman of the DC Universe, the magical Green Lantern of an earlier generation who coexists with the more science fiction-oriented heroes of the Green Lantern Corps. When DC brought back its internal Multiverse concept in the 2000s, it reintroduced a new, young version of Alan on the new Earth-Two, this time as a gay man and the owner of a media conglomerate whose magical powers stem from his role as champion of the Green, an entity embodying plant life on Earth.|$|E

500|$|Sanz {{was born}} in Madrid, Spain, on December 18, 1968, the {{youngest}} son of María Pizarro and Jesús Sánchez. He {{grew up in the}} neighborhood of Moratalaz in eastern Madrid. Sanz recalled that [...] "Back then, kids grew up on the street...I was <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> the group troubadour; the one who played the guitar and sang. That kept me out of a lot of trouble." [...] Sanz's father, a door-to-door book salesman, played guitar professionally, which inspired seven-year-old Sanz to learn to play the instrument. He pursued the instrument with an intensity that eventually frustrated his mother, who broke his guitar one morning after his playing kept the family from sleeping.|$|E
500|$|Welles never {{confirmed}} {{a principal}} {{source for the}} character of Charles Foster Kane. Houseman wrote that Kane is a synthesis of different personalities, with Hearst's life used as the main source. Some events and details were invented, and Houseman wrote that he and Mankiewicz also [...] "grafted anecdotes from other giants of journalism, including Pulitzer, Northcliffe and Mank's first boss, Herbert Bayard Swope." [...] Welles said, [...] "Mr. Hearst was quite <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> Kane, although Kane isn't really founded on Hearst in particular, many people sat for it so to speak". He specifically acknowledged that aspects of Kane were drawn from the lives of two business tycoons familiar from his youth in Chicago—Samuel Insull and Harold Fowler McCormick.|$|E
