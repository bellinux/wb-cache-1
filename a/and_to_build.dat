The units that landed were the 6th Volunteer Regiments of Illinois and Massachusetts, an Artillery battalion, five battery companies, two engineer companies and a medical unit. The men who had not abandoned the barrio of Guanica swore allegiance to the United States. Garretson named Agustín Barrenechea mayor of Guanica and Simón Mejil the chief of police. On the afternoon of the 25th, Garretson left Guánica with seven companies of the 6th Massachusetts and one company of the 6th Illinois and headed towards Yauco.|$|E
5|$|In 1338 Southampton was raided by French forces; the town's defences proved inadequate, {{particularly}} {{along the}} quays {{on the west}} {{and south of the}} city. Edward III ordered some immediate improvements to Southampton's town walls {{but it was not until}} the 1360s that substantial work began. Over the coming decades the town was entirely enclosed by a 2km (1.25-mile) long stone wall, with 29 towers and eight gates. With the advent of gunpowder weapons in the 1360s and 1370s, Southampton was one of the first towns in England to install the new technology to existing fortifications <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> new towers specifically to house cannon.|$|E
5|$|In the mid 1960s, Sands and its {{adjacent}} properties {{were bought}} by the reclusive businessman Howard Hughes, who built a 500-room tower and modernized the hotel.

5|$|Minnehaha Falls {{received}} pilgrimages {{from fans}} of Longfellow's The Song of Hiawatha by the 1870s. At the same time, business {{people wanted to}} harness its power. In 1884 Loring advocated a Minnesota state park at Minnehaha Falls, a goal the state {{tried and failed to}} achieve. In 1888, Cleveland presented The Aesthetic Development of the United Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis at the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts and convinced the city to preserve the waterfall <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a city park there. In the 1890s, Cleveland's Minnehaha Park was annexed to Minneapolis and completed the Grand Rounds. Today Minnehaha Park sees 500,000 visitors each year. Named by Folwell, the 52-mile (83km) Grand Rounds circles from Northeast, Minneapolis to Theodore Wirth Park, to the Chain of Lakes and follows the Mississippi River upstream past Minnehaha Falls to downtown.|$|E
5|$|Pierce did not temper {{his rhetoric}} {{after losing the}} nomination. In his final message to Congress, {{delivered}} in December 1856, he vigorously attacked Republicans and abolitionists. He {{took the opportunity to}} defend his record on fiscal policy, and on achieving peaceful relations with other nations. In {{the final days of the}} Pierce administration, Congress passed bills to increase the pay of army officers <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> new naval vessels, also expanding the number of seamen enlisted. It also passed a tariff reduction bill he had long sought. Pierce and his cabinet left office on March 4, 1857, the only time in U.S. history that the original cabinet members all remained for a full four-year term.|$|E
5|$|Pope Innocent IV {{supported}} Mindaugas, {{hoping that}} a new Christian state could stem the inroads being made by the Golden Horde, {{a state of the}} Mongol Empire. On 17 July 1251, the pope signed two crucial papal bulls. One of them ordered the Bishop of Chełmno to crown Mindaugas as King of Lithuania, appoint a bishop for Lithuania, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a cathedral. The other bull specified that the new bishop was to be directly subordinate to the pope. This was a welcome development to the Lithuanians, since they were concerned that their long-standing antagonists, the Livonian Order, would exert too much control over the new state.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{building}} of the canal, navigation between the towns of Bridgwater and Taunton was possible by using the River Parrett and the River Tone. The Tone had been improved by its Conservators, who had obtained Acts of Parliament in 1699 and 1707, which had allowed them to straighten and dredge the river and parts of the Parrett, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> locks and half-locks to manage the water levels. The initial work was completed by 1717, although further improvements including more locks continued to be made until the early 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Washington was not {{a member}} of any {{political}} party and hoped {{that they would not be}} formed, fearing conflict that would undermine republicanism. His closest advisors formed two factions, setting the framework for the future First Party System. Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton had bold plans to establish the national credit <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a financially powerful nation, and he formed the basis of the Federalist Party. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson was the founder of the Jeffersonian Republicans, and he strenuously opposed Hamilton's agenda. Washington typically favored Hamilton over Jefferson, and it was Hamilton's agenda that went into effect. Jefferson's political actions, his support of Philip Freneau's National Gazette, and his attempt to undermine Hamilton nearly led George Washington to dismiss him from his cabinet, though he ultimately left the cabinet voluntarily. Washington never forgave him and never spoke to him again.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the terms}} of DrSteevens' will were that work on the {{hospital}} would not begin until after Griselda Steevens' death, she decided to begin work on the hospital in 1720. Reserving only £120 per year for her own use, she used the remaining funds to buy a plot of land near Kilmainham <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the new hospital, with the sole condition being that she be granted a suite of apartments in the building. As a youth Griselda had suffered a disorder of the eyes, and since then had worn a veil while in sunlight. Shy and reclusive, while conducting her charitable works in the Dublin slums she would remain in her carriage while servants gave out alms to the poor. By 1723 a sufficient portion of the new Dr Steevens' Hospital was completed to accommodate 40 patients, in addition to Griselda's apartments. The remainder of the hospital, with space for 200 patients, opened in 1733. Griselda lived in the hospital from 1723 until her death.|$|E
5|$|Each race {{relies on}} two {{resources}} {{to sustain their}} game economies <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> their forces: minerals and vespene gas. Minerals are needed for all units and structures, and are obtained by using a worker unit to harvest the resource directly from mineral nodes scattered around the battlefield. Players require vespene gas to construct advanced units and buildings, and acquire it by constructing a gas extraction building {{on top of a}} geyser and using worker units to extract the gas from it. In addition, players need to regulate the supplies for their forces to ensure that they can construct the number of units they need. Although the nature of the supply differs between the races—Terrans use physical supplies held in depots, Protoss use psionic energy channeled from their homeworld via pylons, and Zerg are regulated by the number of controlling overlord units present—the supply mechanic essentially works {{in exactly the same way}} for each race (just with differing impacts on gameplay), allowing players to create new units when there are sufficient resources to sustain them.|$|E
5|$|Scott Street bridge had {{gradually}} deteriorated, and {{a public}} consultation was held in 1986, to determine its future. By that time a 10-ton weight limit had been imposed on traffic using the bridge, because of its poor structural state. Three suggestions were made as to its future. These were to close and demolish it, to refurbish it at an estimated cost of £1.6million, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a new bridge on the same site but a different alignment, to eliminate the awkward turn at the west end, which was costed at £2million. None of these actions have been taken, as the bridge leaves were raised in 1994, and have remained raised ever since. Consideration was given in 2007 to preserving two of the hydraulic rams which operated the bridge, during planning to demolish the structure. The Hull Hydraulic Power Company {{was set up in}} 1872, and by 1876 was operating a pumping station on Machell Street. This supplied water to a high pressure main which ran from Wellington Street to Sculcoates Bridge, and was used by local industries to power machinery, including the bridge when it was constructed. Although the power company closed in the 1940s, it made Hull the first city in the world to have a public system of power distribution.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} slaves in Indiana were {{owned by the}} French traders who entered the region and introduced the practice to the native tribes. Jesuit priests encouraged the tribes they lived among to adopt slavery {{as an alternative to}} executing their prisoners in war. According to some classical historians, the decline of cannibalism among the tribes was {{a direct result of the}} rise of slavery. Early slaves were often Native Americans who were sold to pay debts. The early slaves typically performed manual labor, helping the traders transport their goods <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> forts and trading posts. While part of new France, laws were enacted to give slaves some protection from their masters. Torture and mutilation of slaves was forbidden, and families were prevented from being forcibly broken up. Other laws allowed slaves to be seized by creditors as payment. Other laws required that if a master had children by a slave, the slave and her children were then to be freed. Their status under the French laws was similar to that of minors.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} likely rebuilt as a castle in 1305, when John de Segrave, 2nd Baron Segrave, Nicholas' son, {{was granted a}} licence by King Edward I of England to crenellate the {{property}} (decorating a parapet with rectangular gaps in the wall through which archers could fire; largely a status symbol by that time) <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a moat and wall. The property was also extended with a chapel and several outbuildings at around the same time. Further rebuilding was undertaken in 1354, when another licence to crenellate was received. In {{the second half of}} the 14th century, the castle was inherited by Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, who, in 1398, accused Henry of Bolingbroke (later King Henry IV) of treason against King Richard II. The two noblemen were to take part in a duel at Gosford Green, between Caludon Castle and Coventry, but Richard II banished both before the duel could take place. After Henry took the throne, he stripped Mowbray of the dukedom, and Mowbray died in exile shortly afterwards. Mowbray was succeeded by John de Mowbray, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, who was restored to the dukedom.|$|E
5|$|The {{money was}} used to {{complete}} the line to Nantwich, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a reservoir at Bunbury Heath. The work was completed in August 1779, and the company hoped to raise enough money to then build the line to Middlewich. They proposed building it with narrow locks, to reduce the cost, but the shareholders were not prepared to support them; instead they concentrated on trying to generate traffic on the line that had been built. They attempted to mine salt at Nantwich, but failed to find any, and tried running boats on the Trent and Mersey, from which goods were carried over land to Nantwich, for onward carriage to Liverpool. They also ran boats for cargo and passengers on the canal itself. By the end of 1781, the company had no money {{and was unable to}} meet interest payments on the loans. They decided to forfeit the canal to Egerton, the main mortgagee, but he did not respond to their offer. Angry landowners who had not been paid drained Bunbury reservoir in March 1782, but somehow the committee managed to keep the canal open, by selling boats and land. Disaster struck in November 1787, when Beeston Staircase Locks collapsed, and there was no money to fund repairs.|$|E
