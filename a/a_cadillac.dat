5|$|It {{was first}} {{revealed}} that Bieber and Flatts would be shooting a video for the remix {{version of the}} song when TMZ revealed photos on Bieber on set of the video shoot. The photos pictured Bieber after a dramatic haircut, changing his trademark style over the previous two years. The video premiered during the ABC special, Rascal Flatts: Nothing Like This Presented by JC Penney, which aired March 12, 2011. The video begins with Rascal Flatts arriving in <b>a</b> <b>Cadillac</b> Escalade to a studio. Inside, they are directed to Bieber, who is playing the keyboard. Bieber then sings his lines, playing guitar, and is joined by Joe Don Rooney also on guitar, and Jay DeMarcus now on keyboard. The woman who directed the band into the studio now directs them and Bieber into another room with lights, to film the video. Gary LeVox then sings his lines, joined by Bieber for the chorus while Rooney is on guitar and DeMarcus playing a grand piano. All are wearing black, with Bieber in particular wearing a leather jacket, his signature dog tag, and grey Supras sneakers. During the sequence of the video, more behind-the-scenes action is shown, before it ends with only Bieber's silhouette shown, as his jacket is on the ground.|$|E
5|$|When Leslie leaves Ron {{with his}} {{favorite}} movies for his surprise birthday party, {{one of them}} is The Bridge on the River Kwai, a 1958 film about British World War II prisoners forced to build a bridge in Thailand. The scene Ron watches on television is an actual scene from that film. The other film Leslie gives Ron is The Dirty Dozen, a 1967 war film about a team of convicted murderers being trained for mission to assassinate German officers, also during World War II. Leslie only finds out Ron's birthday, which was a closely guarded secret, by bribing an employee from Baskin-Robbins, an ice cream parlor chain that gives free scoops of ice cream to customers on their birthdays. Eagleton is such a rich town that, after their town meeting, they distribute gift bags that include an iPod Touch, a portable music player by Apple, Inc. Lindsay Carlisle Shay also drives <b>a</b> <b>Cadillac</b> Escalade, an expensive luxury sport utility vehicle brand by Cadillac.

25|$|Interestingly, in Packard circles, {{the fact}} that the marque's lower priced cars were {{designated}} Packards is thought by many to have ultimately resulted in the ruination of the company. In LaSalle's case that it wasn't <b>a</b> <b>Cadillac</b> was probably the ruinous factor. People do buy prestige and <b>a</b> <b>Cadillac</b> was prestige. LaSalle did not have the time to develop a prestigious name before the onset of the Great Depression, and did not have the opportunity after.|$|E

Though testers noted that the Cadillac had {{a higher level of}} quality than the Chevrolet along with a far more luxurious interior (the DeVille was upholstered in leather while the Caprice had the standard cloth trim), the magazine ultimately considered the Chevy as the better value at $5,550 compared to the Cadillac's $9,081 price mainly due to the fact the $3,500 price difference bought only a modest quality addition and a few more luxury features.|$|E
