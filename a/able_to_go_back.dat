5|$|This led {{to further}} {{complications}} in the writing process. For a few days, {{it was thought that}} Monk and Dr. Kroger would work to solve the case, but upon realizing that Monk would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to a clinical detachment with Dr. Kroger, they eliminated this idea. So instead, Dr. Kroger does appear in more scenes than he normally does, but he stays out of the investigation scenes. As a result, Monk and Dr. Kroger do not break into Francis Merrigan's office to snoop around, though {{that would have been the}} typical thing to do if someone else were there. Rather, they simply peer through the sliding glass door that opens from Merrigan's office into the courtyard.|$|E
5|$|In the {{courtroom}} trials, the player aims {{to prove their}} clients' innocence. In order to do so, they cross-examine witnesses; during these cross-examinations, the player aims to find lies and inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimonies. They are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{and forth between the}} different statements in the testimony, and can press the witness for more details on a statement. When the player finds an inconsistency, they can present a piece of evidence that contradicts the statement. In the Nintendo DS version, the player can choose to press and present by using vocal commands, and in the Wii version, players have the option to present evidence by swinging the Wii Remote. At certain points, the player has to answer questions from the judge, the witnesses, or the prosecutor through a multiple-choice answer selection, or by presenting evidence that supports Phoenix's claims. On the screen, a number of exclamation marks are shown; if the player presents an incorrect piece of evidence, one of the exclamation marks disappear. If all disappear, the client is found guilty and the player must restart. When the player solves a case, they unlock a new one to play.|$|E
5|$|Beta: Arc Light of the Point of Infinity follows Mayuri, and {{is set in}} {{the beta}} attractor field, after Daru's future daughter, Suzuha Amane, brought Okabe back in time to save Kurisu; this is {{necessary}} to avoid a world line where Kurisu's time travel theories are stolen, resulting in an arms race leading up to World War III. Okabe fails at first, as world line convergence appears to make Kurisu's death inevitable; Suzuha is about to make him try one more time, but Mayuri stops her, as she thinks Okabe has suffered enough. Suzuha does not go back to the time she came from, still intending to get Okabe to try once more, but notes that {{due to a lack of}} fuel, the time machine will no longer be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> far enough after less than a year has passed. After that time is nearly up, Suzuha gets ready to travel back in time and try saving Kurisu herself, but Mayuri follows along. They arrive just after the past Suzuha and Okabe left to save Kurisu for the first time, and Mayuri tells her past self that she needs to get Okabe to try again. The scene from the beginning plays out again, but Mayuri slaps Okabe and tells him that he is not the type to give up. The future Mayuri and Suzuha leave before the past Okabe and Suzuha return, with too little fuel to be able to tell where they will end up.|$|E

50|$|In {{a perfect}} world, it would be. But we don't {{live in a}} perfect world. There's a kind of desperation {{at the margins of}} music and society today. Musicians are facing the same dimenished {{possibilities}} as everyone else. I find it hard to fault someone who takes a major label deal when their only other option is to work as a night security guard. That doesn't mean I'm any less sure that eventually they'll fall into a rut, trim back the guitars, make those small compromises daily which turn great bands into commodities.

25|$|The Mishnah {{reported}} {{that if the}} 14th of Nisan falls on the Sabbath, Rabbi Meir taught that one must destroy leaven before the Sabbath (except for that required {{for the beginning of}} the Sabbath itself). But the Sages maintained that one destroys the leaven at its usual time (on the morning of the 14th). Rabbi Eleazar bar Zadok taught that one had to destroy consecrated meat before the Sabbath (because if any was left, none could eat it), and unconsecrated food at its usual time (because one could easily find eaters for it). The Mishnah taught that those on the way to perform religious duties who recollect leaven at home, if they are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> destroy it, and then return to the religious duty, must go back and destroy it. But if they cannot, then they annul it in their heart. Similarly, those on the way to save people from an emergency annul it in their heart. But those on their way to appoint a Sabbath station to set the limits of where they may travel on the Sabbath must return immediately to destroy the leaven. Similarly, those who left Jerusalem and recollected that they had consecrated meat with them, if they had passed Mount Scopus, they burned it where they were. But if they had not traveled that far, they returned and burned {{it in front of the}} Temple with the wood arranged for use in the altar. The Mishnah then discussed for what quantity they had to return. Rabbi Meir said for both leaven and consecrated meat, they had to return for a quantity as much as an egg. Rabbi Judah said when there was as much as an olive. But the Sages ruled that for consecrated meat, they had to return for as much as an olive; while for leaven, they had to return for as much as an egg.|$|E

500|$|In the {{courtroom}} trials, the player aims {{to get their}} client declared [...] "not guilty". To do so, they cross-examine witnesses, and aim to find lies and inconsistencies in the testimonies. They are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{and forth between the}} different statements in the testimony, and can press the witness for more details on a statement. When the player finds an inconsistency, they can present a piece of evidence that contradicts the statement. The player is penalized if they present incorrect evidence: in the first game, a number of exclamation marks is shown, with one disappearing after each mistake the player makes; in later games, a health bar that represents the judge's patience is used instead. If all exclamation marks are lost, or the health bar reaches zero, the player loses the game and their client is declared guilty.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{understanding}} the maternity experience {{for women who}} are mothers of a child diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Twenty-six mothers answered a semi-structured interview. The qualitative textual analysis of the interview resulted in the following categories: “the diagnosis moment”; “the perception of motherhood”; “worries, difficulties and aspirations” and “expectations for the future”. The interviewed mothers attributed the cause of Cerebral Palsy to medical error or to the negligence of health professionals during the pre-labor and labor phases, to the precariousness of resources in the hospital, or to their own fault. Among the concerns, the fear of becoming sick and dying, the lack of qualified health professionals, the worry that their child will suffer some kind of exclusion at school, and the need to promote the maximum autonomy possible. As for the difficulties, they mentioned public transportation for their children’s locomotion, the situations in which their child is not well accepted or suffers with prejudice, the criticisms towards the way that they care for their children and the lack of respect from some people on the streets. Concerning the future expectations, the mothers revealed that they would like <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> work, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> school, to invest in their personal care, and <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> have leisure time. The results indicate that motherhood requires constant adaptation {{to the needs of the}} child with cerebral palsy and highlight the importance of family support and the advising that mothers receive from health professionals...|$|R
40|$|In {{this chapter}} we use census {{microdata}} to examine trends in cohabitation in Mexico between 1930 and 2010. The microdata reveal {{a dramatic increase}} in cohabitation since the 1990 s. By being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> further <b>back</b> in time than in the other countries examined in this book, we better document the phase that preceded the post- 1990 cohabitation boom. This earlier phase was characterized by the systematic reduction in cohabitation in favor of marriages, which results in an overall U-shaped evolution of cohabitation for the entire period between 1930 and 2010. Judging from the mere cross-sectional profiles and results from multilevel models, one could conclude that recent cohabitation replicates historical differentials. However, several features emerge that strongly mitigate this historical inheritance and fits the Second Demographic Transition theory. Among others, these features include that cohabitation is now a “normal” form of partnership among the expanding top educational groups and that the shift from marriage to prolonged cohabitation is driven by further secularization and an overall shift in values. Time will tell how fast and to what degree the shift to the SDT-type will be occurring in Mexico, but at present {{it is clear that the}} shift away from the traditional type is under way...|$|R
60|$|But {{this is what}} we can by {{no means}} allow them. We never will admit rashness or chance to have {{produced}} all this harmony and order. It is visible to the world, that the several steps towards this change were slowly taken, and with the utmost caution. The movers observed as they went on, how matters would bear, and advanced no farther at first, than so as they might be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> stop or <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> if circumstances were not mature. Things were grown to such a height, that it was no longer the question, whether a person who aimed at an employment, were a Whig or a Tory, much less, whether he had merit or proper abilities for what he pretended to: he must owe his preferment only to the favourites; and the crown was so far from nominating, that they would not allow it a negative. This, the Qu[een] was resolved no longer to endure, and began to break into their prescription, by bestowing one or two places of consequence,[4] without consulting her ephori; after they had fixed them for others, and concluded as usually, that all their business was to signify their pleasure to her M[ajest]y. But though the persons the Qu[een] had chosen, were such as no objection could well be raised against upon the score of party; yet the oligarchy took the alarm;[5] their sovereign authority was, it seems, called in question; they grew into anger and discontent, as if their undoubted rights were violated. All former obligations to their sovereign now became cancelled; and they put themselves upon the foot of people, who were hardly used after the most eminent services.|$|R

2500|$|Khan {{entered the}} García fight as a heavy {{favourite}} {{and through the}} first two rounds and most of the third he outlanded García while García was finding the range. However, the tide turned against Khan very late in the third round as García was able to land a hard counterpunch off a missed right. Khan hit the canvas and suddenly had to fight to stay alive as García's punch to the neck and jaw badly hurt him. Only the bell saved Khan from a second knockdown and García kept pressing early in round four, forcing Khan to take a second standing eight count after he touched the canvas with his glove. Khan regrouped and was temporarily <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> at García, but with less than a minute left in the round Khan was dropped a third time. Referee Kenny Bayless stopped the fight despite Khan assuring him he could continue, deciding enough was enough. After the fight, Khan said, [...] "It wasn't my night. I was coming in with my hands down and Danny took advantage of that. He countered very well against me." [...] According to CompuBox stats, Khan landed 92 of 206 punches thrown (45%), with 46 jabs and 46 power shots landed. García landed 65 of his 216 thrown (30%), 60 of which were power shots. Khan earned $950,000, while García had a $520,000 purse. Nevada State Athletic Commission announced the fight generated a total gate of $426,152 from 3,147 tickets sold. The fight averaged 1.3 million viewers on HBO World Championship Boxing.|$|E
