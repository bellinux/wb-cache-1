50|$|One puzzling {{consequence}} of Kripke semantics is that identities involving rigid designators are necessary. If water is H2O, then water <b>is</b> <b>necessarily</b> H2O. Since the terms 'water' and 'H2O' {{pick out the}} same object in every possible world, there is no possible world in which 'water' picks out something different from 'H2O'. Therefore, water <b>is</b> <b>necessarily</b> H2O. It <b>is</b> possible, of course, that we are mistaken about the chemical composition of water, {{but that does not}} affect the necessity of identities. What is not being claimed is that water <b>is</b> <b>necessarily</b> H2O, but conditionally, if water is H2O (though we may not know this, it does not change the fact if it is true), then water <b>is</b> <b>necessarily</b> H2O.|$|R
5|$|Skeptics of New World Order {{conspiracy}} theories accuse its proponents of indulging in the furtive fallacy, {{a belief that}} significant facts of history <b>are</b> <b>necessarily</b> sinister; conspiracism, a world view that centrally places {{conspiracy theories}} in the unfolding of history, rather than social and economic forces; and fusion paranoia, a promiscuous absorption of fears from any source whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset of these {{will be used to}} transcribe any one language. It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in which sounds are described in a great deal of detail, is known as a narrow transcription. A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a broad transcription. Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in square brackets. Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details that are relevant to the discussion at hand, and may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed <b>are</b> <b>necessarily</b> meaningful in the language.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofer {{output level}} can be {{increased}} by increasing cone surface area or by increasing cone excursion. Since large drivers require undesirably large cabinets, most subwoofer drivers have large excursions. Unfortunately, high excursion, at high power levels, tends to produce more distortion from inherent mechanical and magnetic effects in electro-dynamic drivers (the most common sort). The conflict between assorted goals can never be fully resolved; subwoofer designs <b>are</b> <b>necessarily</b> compromises. Hofmans's Iron Law (the efficiency of a woofer system is directly proportional to its cabinet volume and to the cube of its cutoff frequency) applies to subwoofers just as to all loudspeakers.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} {{can also}} be applied to natural kinds. If water is H2O, then water <b>is</b> <b>necessarily</b> H2O. Since the terms 'water' and 'H2O' pick out the same object in every possible world, there is no possible world in which 'water' picks out something different from 'H2O'. Therefore, water <b>is</b> <b>necessarily</b> H2O. It <b>is</b> possible, of course, that we are mistaken about the chemical composition of water, {{but that does not}} affect the necessity of identities.

5|$|The {{wide range}} of {{thematic}} material presented in the orchestral and solo expositions poses a challenge for the recapitulation. Mozart manages to recapitulate all of the themes in the home key of C minor. The themes <b>are</b> <b>necessarily</b> compressed, are presented in a different order, and in their restated form contain few virtuosic moments for the soloist. The last theme to be recapitulated is the secondary theme of the orchestral exposition, {{which has not been}} heard for some 400 measures and is now adorned by a passage of triplets from the piano. The recapitulation concludes with the piano playing arpeggiated sixteenths before a cadential trill leads into a ritornello. The ritornello in turn leads into a fermata that prompts the soloist's cadenza.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{definition}} adopted, neither the town nor the urban area <b>are</b> <b>necessarily</b> coterminous with the borough. Historically, {{the town of}} Reading was smaller than the borough. Definitions include the old ecclesiastical parishes of the churches of St Mary, St Laurence and St Giles, or the even smaller pre-19th century borough. Today, {{as well as the}} town centre Reading comprises a number of suburbs and other districts, both within the borough itself and within the surrounding urban area. The names and location of these suburbs are in general usage but, except where some of the outer suburbs correspond to civil parishes, there are no formally defined boundaries. The Reading town area, sometimes referred to as Greater Reading, incorporates the town's eastern and western suburbs outside the borough, in the civil parishes of Earley, Woodley, Purley and Tilehurst. The Reading urban area (officially Reading/Wokingham) additionally includes Winnersh, Wokingham and Crowthorne with an overall population of around 320,000 inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Ecological studies <b>are</b> <b>necessarily</b> {{holistic}} {{as opposed}} to reductionistic. Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations {{without reference to the}} whole system, which leads to 3) a metaphysical hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from mysticism that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the biomolecular properties of the exterior shells.|$|E
