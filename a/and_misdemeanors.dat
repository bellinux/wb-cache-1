5|$|Match Point is a 2005 British-Luxembourgish {{psychological}} thriller film {{written and}} directed by Woody Allen and starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode, Brian Cox, and Penelope Wilton. In the film, Rhys Meyers's character marries into a wealthy family, but his social position is threatened by his affair with his brother-in-law's girlfriend, played by Johansson. The film treats themes of morality, greed, and the roles of lust, money, and luck in life, leading many to compare it to Allen's earlier film Crimes <b>and</b> <b>Misdemeanors</b> (1989). It was produced and filmed in London after Allen had difficulty finding financial support for the film in New York. The agreement obliged him to make it there using a cast and crew mostly from the United Kingdom. Allen quickly re-wrote the script, which was originally set in New York, for a British setting.|$|E
5|$|To {{sequester}} Clayton {{from the}} {{affairs in the}} state, the Brindles and the Democrats decided {{the only thing they}} could do was elect him to the US Senate. However, even though he won unanimously, he refused to take his seat, which would mean letting Johnson become governor. In 1871, the state House of Representatives drafted articles of impeachment against Clayton, charging him {{with a wide variety of}} impeachable actions, including depriving Johnson and several other state officials of offices to which they had been fairly elected, removing state officials and judges from offices to which they had been fairly elected, aiding in fraudulent elections, taking bribes for state railroad bonds, and various other high crimes <b>and</b> <b>misdemeanors.</b> The members of the House then tried to suspend Clayton from his duties as governor by force. They even apparently tried locking him in his office and nailing the door shut. However, Clayton responded that they had no right by the state constitution to deprive him of his office. At the same time, the House also brought impeachment charges against Chief Justice John McClure for his part in trying to deny Johnson the privileges of his office of lieutenant governor.|$|E

25|$|At the 1889 Montana state {{constitutional}} convention, delegates retained {{nearly all the}} language of the 1884 constitution. However, county courts were abolished and jurisdiction for probate given to district courts. The number of district courts was expanded to eight from four. The 1889 constitution also limited the creation of inferior courts (such as intermediate appellate courts, municipal courts, and small claims courts) only in state-incorporated cities or towns. The jurisdiction of district courts was specified somewhat in detail, and included both felonies <b>and</b> <b>misdemeanors</b> not otherwise assigned to another court. District courts acted as an intermediate court of appeals, and could not hear cases de novo. Impeachment powers were vested solely in the Montana Senate.|$|E
25|$|In March 1998, Philadelphia mayor Ed Rendell {{appointed}} Timoney as Philadelphia Police commissioner. Timoney served {{through the}} end of 2001. His career marked a turnaround in Philadelphia's increasing homicide rate but had controversy. Critics challenged his handling of protests during the 2000 Republican National Convention, particularly his use of undercover agents to infiltrate protest groups. Timoney testified under oath at the trial of Matthew Berghs, who was charged with aggravated assault, a felony, <b>and</b> <b>misdemeanors</b> simple assault, obstruction of justice, and recklessly endangering another person during the convention. Berghs was held in jail for three days on $50,000 bail. During the trial, Berghs' attorney showed the jury photographs of five-day old bruises and scrapes he claimed showed that Berghs had been beaten by police officers. Both the arresting officer and Timoney denied there was violence during the arrest. Berghs, a slight 19-year old activist and Indiana University student, was accused of hitting a Philadelphia police officer, Thomas Donahue, with a seven-foot bamboo stick. The prosecution was unable to supply fingerprint evidence to support their claims and relied solely on eyewitness testimony from the officer and the commissioner. Timoney testified under oath on behalf of officer Donahue, claiming he witnessed the entire incident, but he was unable to convince the twelve-person jury that Berghs was guilty of anything. Berghs was acquitted.|$|E

500|$|Allen revisits some of {{the themes}} he had {{explored}} in Crimes <b>and</b> <b>Misdemeanors</b> (1989), such as the existence of justice in the universe. Both films feature a murder of an unwanted mistress, and [...] "offer a depressing view on fate, fidelity, {{and the nature of}} man". That film's protagonist, Judah Rosenthal, is an affluent member of the upper-middle class having an extramarital affair. After he tries to break the affair off, his mistress blackmails him and threatens to go to his wife. Soon, Rosenthal decides to murder his mistress, but is racked with guilt over violating his moral code. Eventually, he learns to ignore his guilt and go on as though nothing has happened. Philip French compared the two films' plots and themes in The Observer, and characterised Match Points as a [...] "clever twist on the themes of chance and fate".|$|E

District Courts also have the power to issue writs and naturalize citizens.|$|E
