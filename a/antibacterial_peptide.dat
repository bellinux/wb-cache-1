40|$|Objective] This study {{aimed to}} extract <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> from mussel. [Method] Blue mussels {{were used as}} raw {{materials}} for direct extraction of <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> by using 0. 5 % acetic acid, and the <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> were isolated and purified by Sephacryl S- 100 polyacrylamide gel chromatography.

Molecular weight of the <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> was determined by SDS-PAGE. Variation of antibacterial activity of <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> was measured at 100 ℃ under conditions of different processing time and different pH. [Result] The 0. 5 % acetic acid was used for crude extraction of <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> as extraction solution and led to relatively high extraction efficiency.

40|$|We {{present an}} Identify Selective <b>Antibacterial</b> <b>Peptides</b> (ISAP) {{approach}} based on abstracts meaning. Laboratories and researchers have significantly increased {{the report of}} their discoveries related to <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> in primary publications. It is important to find <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> that {{have been reported in}} primary publications because they can produce antibiotics of different generations that attack and destroy the bacteria. Unfortunately, researchers used heterogeneous forms of natural language to describe their discoveries (sometimes without the sequence of the peptides). Thus, we propose that learning the words meaning instead of the <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> sequence is possible to identify and predict <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> reported in the PubMed engine. The ISAP approach consists of two stages: training and discovering. ISAP founds that the 35 % of the abstracts sample had <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> and we tested in the updated Antimicrobial Peptide Database 2 (APD 2). ISAP predicted that 45 % of the abstracts had <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides.</b> That is, ISAP found that 810 <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> were not classified like that, so they are not reported in APD 2. As a result, this new search tool would complement the APD 2 with a set of peptides that are candidates to be antibacterial. Finally, 20 % of the abstracts were not semantic related to APD 2...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> are {{important}} {{components of the}} innate immune system, used by the host to protect itself from different types of pathogenic bacteria. Over the last few decades, the search for new drugs and drug targets has prompted an interest in these <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides.</b> We analyzed 486 <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides,</b> obtained from antimicrobial peptide database APD, {{in order to understand}} the preference of amino acid residues at specific positions in these peptides. Results It was observed that certain types of residues are preferred over others in <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides,</b> particularly at the N and C terminus. These observations encouraged us to develop a method for predicting <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> in proteins from their amino acid sequence. First, the N-terminal residues were used for predicting <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Quantitative Matrices (QM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which resulted in an accuracy of 83. 63 %, 84. 78 % and 87. 85 %, respectively. Then, the C-terminal residues were used for developing prediction methods, which resulted in an accuracy of 77. 34 %, 82. 03 % and 85. 16 % using ANN, QM and SVM, respectively. Finally, ANN, QM and SVM models were developed using N and C terminal residues, which achieved an accuracy of 88. 17 %, 90. 37 % and 92. 11 %, respectively. All the models developed in this study were evaluated using five-fold cross validation technique. These models were also tested on an independent or blind dataset. Conclusion Among <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides,</b> there is preference for certain residues at N and C termini, which helps to demarcate them from non-antibacterial peptides. Both the termini play a crucial role in imparting the antibacterial property to these peptides. Among the methods developed, SVM shows the best performance in predicting <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> followed by QM and ANN, in that order. AntiBP (<b>Antibacterial</b> <b>peptides)</b> will help in discovering efficacious <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides,</b> which we hope will prove to be a boon to combat the dreadful antibiotic resistant bacteria.

50|$|Nisin is a {{polycyclic}} <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptide</b> {{produced by}} the bacterium Lactococcus lactis that {{is used as a}} food preservative. It has 34 amino acid residues, including the uncommon amino acids lanthionine (Lan), methyllanthionine (MeLan), didehydroalanine (Dha), and didehydroaminobutyric acid (Dhb). These unusual amino acids are introduced by posttranslational modification of the precursor peptide. In these reactions a ribosomally synthesized 57-mer is converted to the final peptide. The unsaturated amino acids originate from serine and threonine, and the enzyme-catalysed addition of cysteine residues to the didehydro amino acids result in the multiple (5) thioether bridges.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Antibacterial {{peptides}} {{are one of}} the effecter {{molecules of}} innate immune system. Over the last few decades several antibacterial peptides have successfully approved as drug by FDA, which has prompted an interest in these antibacterial peptides. In our recent study we analyzed 999 antibacterial peptides, which were collected from <b>Antibacterial</b> <b>Peptide</b> Database (APD). We have also developed methods to predict and classify these antibacterial peptides using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results During analysis we observed that certain residues are preferred over other in <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptide,</b> particularly at the N and C terminus. These observation and increased data of <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptide</b> in APD encouraged us to again develop a new and more robust method for predicting antibacterial peptides in protein from their amino acid sequence or given peptide have antibacterial properties or not. First, the binary patterns of the 15 N terminus residues were used for predicting <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptide</b> using SVM and achieved accuracy of 85. 46 % with 0. 705 Mathew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Then we used the binary pattern of 15 C terminus residues and achieved accuracy of 85. 05 % with 0. 701 MCC, latter on we developed prediction method by combining N & C terminus and achieved an accuracy of 91. 64 % with 0. 831 MCC. Finally we developed SVM based model using amino acid composition of whole peptide and achieved 92. 14 % accuracy with MCC 0. 843. In this study we used five-fold cross validation technique to develop all these models and tested the performance of these models on an independent dataset. We further classify antibacterial peptides according to their sources and achieved an overall accuracy of 98. 95 %. We further classify antibacterial peptides in their respective family and got a satisfactory result. Conclusion Among antibacterial peptides, there is preference for certain residues at N and C terminus, which helps to discriminate them from non-antibacterial peptides. Amino acid composition of antibacterial peptides helps to demarcate them from non-antibacterial peptide and their further classification in source and family.

40|$|Peptides are a novel {{class of}} anticancer agents {{embracing}} two distinct categories: natural <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides,</b> which are preferentially bound by cancer cells, and chemically synthesized peptides, which bind specifically to precise molecular targets {{located on the}} surface of tumor cells. <b>Antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> bind to both cell and mitochondrial membranes.

We report here that peptides derived from the fifth domain of beta- 2 glycoprotein I (beta(2) GPI), a human heparin binding plasma protein, have antibacterial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Streptococcus pyogenes, an important human pathogen that can survive and grow in human blood, has developed mechanisms to escape the attack by these peptides. Thus, protein H and M 1 protein, two surface proteins of the highly pathogenic S. pyogenes AP 1 strain, bind full-length beta(2) GPI and thereby prevent the processing of beta(2) GPI by proteases from polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) into <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides.</b> In addition, protein H and M 1 protein, released from the bacterial cell wall by PMN-derived proteases, bind to, and inhibit the activity of, beta(2) GPI-derived <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides.</b> Taken together, the {{data suggest that the}} interaction between the streptococcal proteins and beta(2) GPI or beta(2) GPI-derived peptides presents a novel mechanism to resist an antibacterial attack by beta(2) GPI-cleavage product...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Dental caries is a {{multifactorial disease}} {{that is a}} growing and costly global health concern. The onset of disease is a {{consequence}} of an ecological imbalance within the dental plaque biofilm that favors specific acidogenic and aciduric caries pathogens, namely Streptococcus mu-tans and Streptococcus sobrinus. It is now recognized by the scientific and medical community that it is neither possible nor desirable to totally eliminate dental plaque. Conversely, the chemical biocides most commonly used for caries prevention and treatment indiscriminately attack all plaque microorganisms. These treatments also suffer from other drawbacks such as bad taste, irritability, and staining. Furthermore, the public demand for safe and natural personal hygiene products continues to rise. Therefore, there are opportunities that exist to develop new strategies for the treatment of this disease. As an alternative to conventional antibiotics, <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> have been explored greatly over the last three decades for many different therapeutic uses. There are currently tens of hundreds of <b>antibacterial</b> <b>peptides</b> characterized across the evolutionary spectrum, and among these, many demon-strate physical and/or biological properties that may be suitable for a more targeted approach to the selective control or elimination of putative caries pathogens.
