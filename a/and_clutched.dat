5|$|Two {{bishops and}} a hermit came to Vladimir, {{gave him a}} wooden cross, and {{confirmed}} that the tsar had made a pledge of faith on it. Vladimir kissed the cross <b>and</b> <b>clutched</b> it to his chest, collected a few followers, and set off for Prespa. As he arrived, on 22May 1016, he went into a church to pray. When he exited the church, he was struck down by Vladislav's soldiers and beheaded. According to Skylitzes, Vladimir believed Vladislav's pledge, told {{to him by the}} Bulgarian archbishop David. He then allowed himself to fall into Vladislav's hands, and was executed. The motivation behind the murder is unclear. Since Samuel's defeat in 1014, the Bulgarians had been losing battle after battle, and Vladislav probably suspected or was informed that Vladimir planned to restore Duklja's alliance with Byzantium. This alliance would be particularly disturbing for Tsar Vladislav because of the proximity of Duklja to Dyrrhachium, which was a target of the tsar's war efforts.|$|E
25|$|Philip's parents {{appeared}} {{regularly on}} the news <b>and</b> <b>clutched</b> what {{has now become a}} well-recognised picture of a smiling Philip in his Confirmation clothes of a blue jacket and a red rosette. This photo has been deemed a precursor to that of British infant Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal 21 years later. However, the family, unlike the McCanns, have been relatively private about their loss, speaking to the media on only a few occasions in the past 25 years. It has been reported that this is due to several inaccurate reports of the incident of which they have disapproved. Gardaí have, however, praised the media as a proven method for encouraging people to come forward with further information on the case each time an appeal is broadcast. Residents' organisation ACRA also launched an intense campaign to attempt to find Philip.|$|E
25|$|In May 1999, Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, {{and other}} activists protested the December 1998 fatal police {{shooting}} of Tyisha Miller in central Riverside, California. Miller, a 19-year-old African-American woman, had sat unconscious {{in a locked}} car with a flat tire and the engine left running, parked at a local gas station. After her relatives had called 9-1-1, Riverside Police Department officers {{who responded to the}} scene observed a gun in the young woman's lap, and according to their accounts, she was shaking and foaming at the mouth, and in need of medical attention. When officers decided to break her window to reach her, as one officer reached for the weapon, she allegedly awoke <b>and</b> <b>clutched</b> her firearm, prompting several officers to open fire, hitting her 23 times and killing her. When the Riverside County district attorney stated that the officers involved had erred in judgement but committed no crime, declining to file criminal charges against them, Sharpton participated in protests which reached their zenith when protestors spilled onto the busy SR 91, completely stopping traffic. Sharpton was arrested for his participation and leadership in these protests.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study {{regression}} equations are established between broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris) captive reproductive females snout-vent length (SVL) and body mass (BM) <b>and</b> the following <b>clutch</b> characteristics: egg mass, egg "length" (maximal diameter), egg "width" (minimal diameter), hatchling BM, hatchling SVL, clutch size (number of eggs), <b>clutch</b> mass <b>and</b> relative <b>clutch</b> mass (clutch mass/female BM). Female body-length presented a positive correlation with egg mass, egg length, egg width, hatchling BM and hatchling SVL. No clear correlation was found between female SVL <b>and</b> <b>clutch</b> size. Female BM showed a significantly positive correlation with egg mass, egg-length, egg-width, hatchling BM, hatchling SVL <b>and</b> <b>clutch</b> mass. A highly significant negative correlation was found between female BM <b>and</b> the relative <b>clutch</b> mass. No clear correlation was found between female BM <b>and</b> <b>clutch</b> size...|$|R

25|$|In 1938, {{champion}} Joe Louis {{announced that}} he would face Schmeling for the title. The rematch became an instant international sensation. Many clamored impatiently for its happening, but others, afraid of international tensions and the possibility of Hitler taking over the championship, protested. The controversy and ballyhoo led to the event becoming the most anticipated boxing match since the rematch between Dempsey and Gene Tunney, or possibly earlier. Louis, with his poor, black roots was adopted by American fans as the symbol of America as a land of opportunity. In contrast, Americans perceived Schmeling and his ties to Hitler as an obvious threat to those opportunities and ideals. When the German walked to the ring at Yankee Stadium on 22 June 1938, he did so under a hail of garbage thrown from the stands. Louis came out blazing in the first round and Schmeling tried to counter-punch as he had in the first bout, but to no avail. Driven into the ropes and battered with a fusillade of short, crisp blows from every angle, Schmeling turned his back to his opponent <b>and</b> <b>clutched</b> onto the ropes, letting out a scream that even years later, many spectators could recall vividly. Schmeling later said that he screamed because he had been hit with a blow to the kidneys. Schmeling's knees buckled under the punishment, and referee Arthur Donovan pushed Louis away, beginning a count on Schmeling. Schmeling reluctantly stepped away from the ropes, and Donovan allowed him to continue. A few punches later, Schmeling was knocked down again. From then on, he was helpless. He rose but fell moments later, and Donovan stopped the fight.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match was}} between Matt and Jeff Hardy with Lita as the Special Guest Referee. In the beginning, {{the two had}} several {{reversals}} until Matt got in control. Jeff sidestepped when Matt attempted a diving leg drop. Jeff hit a falling headbutt and a clothesline. Jeff went on to deliver a diving leg drop of his own. Jeff went to the top rope but Matt trapped him in a Tree of Woe. Matt then applied the sunset flip, which Jeff countered and both men were lying outside the ring. In the ring, Jeff injured his left knee, which Matt would work on. He hit a chop block {{and a series of}} moves. He tried a powerbomb, but Jeff countered it into a Compactor Clutch. Matt assaulted Jeff again with a Half Boston Crab. Jeff got to the ropes, breaking the hold, and kicked Matt to the outside. Jeff went to the top, but, because of his hurt knee, he fell down. Matt grabbed Jeff's leg but Jeff hit a mule kick. Matt tried a Twist of Fate, but Jeff countered it into a leg drop. Jeff hit a suplex, and went to the top rope again but, because of his knee, Matt took advantage <b>and</b> <b>clutched</b> him. Matt tried to hit a Twist of Fate but Jeff reversed it into his own. Matt attempted a pinfall on Jeff and used ropes for leverage but Lita ordered him to break it. Jeff went to the top rope again, but Matt caught him, and tried to hit him a Twist of Fate from the top. Jeff forced Matt off and hit a Swanton Bomb. Matt tried to get his feet on the ropes, but Jeff pulled them off, and won the match.|$|E
2500|$|A freak catch by wicketkeeper Grout {{dismissed}} Sheppard. McKenzie had bowled {{the opening}} {{over from the}} river end; then Sheppard played forward to Mackay's first ball and edged it to second slip. There Benaud went into contortions; he knocked the ball forward, knocked it a second time as Simpson, from first slip, poised to spring at it. Simpson then plunged to the ground, out of the way, he thought. Grout sprawled over Simpson <b>and</b> <b>clutched</b> the ball as it fell. A circus performance! ...|$|E

2500|$|When Wyatt {{and his men}} approached, the two men ran. Stilwell {{may have}} {{stumbled}} or been wounded, allowing Wyatt to reach him. Wyatt later said he shot Stilwell as Stilwell attempted to push the barrel of Earp's shotgun away. Wyatt, quoted in the Denver Republican, said [...] "I ran straight for Stilwell. It was he who killed my brother. What a coward he was! He couldn't shoot when I came near him. He stood there helpless and trembling for his life. As I rushed upon him he put out his hands <b>and</b> <b>clutched</b> at my shotgun. I let go both barrels, and he tumbled down dead and mangled at my feet." ...|$|E
2500|$|The attack {{occurred}} {{shortly after}} a Riesel radio broadcast. [...] Barry Gray, radio station WMCA's overnight talk radio host, had asked Riesel {{to substitute for}} him. Riesel invited two IUOE Local 138 leaders who were challenging the DeKonings {{for control of the}} local union to join him for the broadcast. The broadcast originated from Hutton's Restaurant at 47th Street and Lexington Avenue shortly after midnight on April 5, and concluded at 2 AM. Afterward, Riesel and his secretary went to Lindy's restaurant, located on Broadway between 49th Street and 50th Street. They had coffee, and departed Lindy's at 3 AM to walk to the secretary's automobile. Riesel removed his eyeglasses, which he did by habit when in public. A slender, black-haired man in blue and white jacket stepped out of the shadows of the entrance to the Mark Hellinger Theatre and threw a vial of sulphuric acid into Riesel's eyes. Riesel shouted, [...] "My gosh! My gosh!", <b>and</b> <b>clutched</b> at his face. While the secretary and others rendered assistance and dragged Riesel into Lindy's, the assailant walked calmly away.|$|E
