The temporary absence of solar radiation gives particular insight into different oxidation and clustering processes leading to NPF.

During a partial solar eclipse over Finland in 2015, we found that this phenomenon had prominent effects on atmospheric on-going NPF.

Using artillery or balloons to loft the gas would be much more expensive. We do not have enough information to evaluate more exotic techniques, such as pumping the gas up through a hose attached to a tower or balloon system. Anthropogenic stratospheric aerosol injection would cool the planet, stop the melting of sea ice and land-based glaciers, slow sea level rise, and increase the terrestrial carbon sink, but produce regional drought, ozone depletion, less sunlight for solar power, and make skies less blue.

40|$|Aerosol {{particles}} play {{an important}} role in the Earth’s troposphere and in the climate system: They scatter and absorb solar radiation, facilitate chemical processes, and serve as condensation nuclei for the formation of clouds. Tropospheric aerosol particles are emitted from surface sources or form in situ from the gas phase. Formation from the gas phase requires concentrations of <b>aerosol</b> <b>precursor</b> molecules aggregating to form molecular clusters able to grow faster than they evaporate. This process is called nucleation. Gas phase ions can reduce the concentration of <b>aerosol</b> <b>precursor</b> molecules required for nucleation, as they greatly stabilize molecular clusters with respect to evaporation. Therefore, ions are a potential source of aerosol particles. Since atmospheric ionization carries the signal of the decadal solar cycle due to the modulation of the galactic cosmic ray intensity by solar activity, a possible connection between the solar cycle, galactic cosmic rays, aerosols, and clouds has been a long-standing focus of interest.

In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using remote polarimetric measurements for constraining aerosol and <b>aerosol</b> <b>precursor</b> emissions {{in light of these}} uncertainties. A model that incorporates a radiative transfer model with forward and adjoint chemical transport models has been applied to quantify the sensitivity of the reflectance at the top of atmosphere over land to aerosol emissions and microphysical properties. A set of simulated satellite observations, one intensity based and one capable of polarimetric measurements, are used to illustrate differences in the assimilation potential between the two. It is found that the sensitivity of the polarized reflectance to aerosol and <b>aerosol</b> <b>precursor</b> emissions tends to be significantly higher than that of the intensity for cases of non-absorbing aerosols. This is true even when the polarimetric sampling scheme is spatially sparser than that of the intensity sampling. This framework allows us to quantify upper limits on the uncertainties in the aerosol microphysical properties for which a 50 % change in aerosol emissions is detectable using these simulated observations. It was found that although typical current remote sensing instrumentation provides retrievals of the refractive index and effective radius with accuracies within acceptable limits to detect a 50 % change in emissions, retrievals of the effective variance contain uncertainties too large to detect these changes in emissions. These results may guide new applications of polarimetric measurements to constrain aerosol sources, and thus reduce uncertainty in our broader understanding of the impacts of aerosols on climate...|$|E

40|$|Policies {{to control}} air quality focus on {{mitigating}} emissions of aerosols and their precursors, and other short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). On a local scale, these policies will have beneficial impacts {{on health and}} crop yields, by reducing particulate matter (PM) and surface ozone concentrations; however, the climate impacts of reducing emissions of SLCPs are less straightforward to predict. In this paper we consider a set of idealised, extreme mitigation strategies, in which the total anthropogenic emissions of individual SLCP emissions species are removed. This provides an upper bound on the potential climate impacts of such air quality strategies. We focus on evaluating the climate responses to changes in anthropogenic emissions of <b>aerosol</b> <b>precursor</b> species: black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC) and sulphur dioxide (SO 2). We perform climate integrations with four fully coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate models (AOGCMs), and examine the effects on global and regional climate of removing the total land-based anthropogenic emissions {{of each of the}} three <b>aerosol</b> <b>precursor</b> species. We find that the SO 2 emissions reductions lead to the strongest response, with all three models showing an increase in surface temperature focussed in the northern hemisphere high latitudes, and a corresponding increase in global mean precipitation and run-off. Changes in precipitation and run-off patterns are driven mostly by a northward shift in the ITCZ, consistent with the hemispherically asymmetric warming pattern driven by the emissions changes. The BC and OC emissions reductions give a much weaker forcing signal, and there is some disagreement between models in the sign of the climate responses to these perturbations. These differences between models are due largely to natural variability in sea-ice extent, circulation patterns and cloud changes. This large natural variability component to the signal when the ocean circulation and sea-ice are free-running means that the BC and OC mitigation measures do not necessarily lead to a discernible climate response...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of biomass}} for energy {{production}} requires {{more attention to}} emissions of fine (submicron) particles. Aerosol from biomass combustion contains large amounts of sulphates and chlorides of alkali metals (K, Na) as well as heavy metals (Pb); the composition depends on both fuel properties and combustion process. These elements and their compounds have typically relatively low melting temperatures so they generate deposits. Hence predicting inorganic aerosol formation in biomass-fired power generation systems could be appealing to control fouling and corrosion. During biomass combustion, some mineral matter compounds, i. e. Na, K, S, Cl, Ca and Mg, vaporize and subsequently undergo a series of gas-phase chemical reactions leading {{to the formation of}} the main <b>aerosol</b> <b>precursors,</b> KCl (g) and K 2 SO 4 (g).

The target is challenging, as it requires the prediction of aerosol forming compounds in the gas phase as well as the gas-to-particle conversion.

40|$|Aircraft {{emissions}} impact {{human health}} though degradation of air quality. The majority of previous analyses of air quality impacts from aviation have considered only landing and takeoff emissions. We show that aircraft cruise emissions impact human health over a hemispheric scale {{and provide the}} first estimate of premature mortalities attributable to aircraft emissions globally. We estimate ~ 8000 premature mortalities per year are attributable to aircraft cruise emissions. This represents ~ 80 % of the total impact of aviation (where the total includes the effects of landing and takeoff emissions), and ~ 1 % of air quality-related premature mortalities from all sources. However, we note {{that the impact of}} landing and takeoff emissions is likely to be under-resolved. Secondary H[subscript 2]SO[subscript 4]−HNO[subscript 3]−NH[subscript 3] aerosols are found to dominate mortality impacts. Due to the altitude and region of the atmosphere at which aircraft emissions are deposited, the extent of transboundary air pollution is particularly strong. For example, we describe how strong zonal westerly winds aloft, the mean meridional circulation around 30 − 60 °N, interaction of aircraft-attributable <b>aerosol</b> <b>precursors</b> with background ammonia, and high population densities in combination give rise to an estimated ~ 3500 premature mortalities per year in China and India combined, despite their relatively small current share of aircraft emissions. Subsidence of aviation-attributable <b>aerosol</b> and <b>aerosol</b> <b>precursors</b> occurs predominantly around the dry subtropical ridge, which results in reduced wet removal of aviation-attributable aerosol. It is also found that aircraft NO[subscript x] emissions serve to increase oxidation of nonaviation SO[subscript 2], thereby further increasing the air quality impacts of aviation. We recommend that cruise emissions be explicitly considered in the development of policies, technologies and operational procedures designed to mitigate the air quality impacts of air transportation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRecent {{aircraft}} {{studies showed}} that new particle formation is very active in the free troposphere and lower stratosphere. And, these observations lead to a new question: when does new particle formation not occur? Here, we provide case studies to show how convection and surface area affect new particle formation in the upper troposphere, using the measured aerosol size distributions during the NSF/NCAR GV Progressive Science Missions in December 2005. There were ten research flights, including three days of nighttime experiments, at latitudes from 18 to 52 ° N and altitudes up to 14 km. About 78 % of the total samples showed the new particle formation feature with number concentrations of particles with diameters from 4 to 9 nm, 670 ± 1270 cm ? 3, and the total particle number concentrations with diameters from 4 to 2000 nm, 920 ± 1470 cm ? 3. Our case studies show that new particle formation was closely associated with convection and low surface areas of preexisting aerosol particles (? 3). On the other hand, for the cases where no new particle formation events were observed, air masses usually did not experience a vertical motion and air often originated from either the upper troposphere or lower stratosphere where precursor concentrations are relatively low; in addition, {{it was also a}} general trend that non-event cases also had higher surface areas (~ 16 ?m² cm ? 3). These observations are consistent with other observations during the Progressive Science Missions (Young et al., 2007). Because of the lower temperatures in this region (T< 250 K), nucleation is thermodynamically favorable; but because of low <b>aerosol</b> <b>precursor</b> concentrations, nucleation is sensitive to <b>aerosol</b> <b>precursor</b> concentration and surface area. Under such conditions, convection (which brings higher concentrations of aerosol precursors and water vapor to higher altitudes) and low surface area play critical roles on whether new particle formation takes place or not.

Barrier coating deposition by AP-PECVD on polymer substrates has been demonstrated to be superior to wet chemical coating, with less consumption of precursor material [1], though many technical challenges remain to obtain the desired (dynamic) growth rates. The pilot equipment utilizes a 0. 5 mm double slit configuration with 1000 - 2000 W power input at a frequency of 40 - 50 kHz with N 2 as the primary carrier gas. By utilizing the plasma afterglow remote from the source, uniform surface treatment can be achieved despite the filamentary discharge in the slits. Deposition on the electrodes is prevented by injection of precursor into the jet and because of the remote nature of the plasma source the thermal load on the substrate is minimized, making it ideally suited for treatment of polymers and paper. A key area for improvement and upscaling of the pilot system for industrial application is optimization of gaseous and liquid (<b>aerosol)</b> <b>precursor</b> injection. To this end, extensive characterization of the plasma jet is undertaken, including current-voltage, fast imaging and optical emission and absorption measurements, with focus on the dynamics of gaseous and <b>aerosol</b> <b>precursor</b> particles in the jet. For optimum control over the gas distribution and precursor injection, Computational Fluid Dynamic models are presented in conjunction with the experimental work...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The time {{evolution}} of aerosol concentration and chemical composition in a megacity urban plume was determined based on 8 flights of the DOE G- 1 aircraft in and downwind of Mexico City during the March 2006 MILA-GRO field campaign. A series of selection criteria are imposed to eliminate data points with non-urban emission influences. Biomass burning has urban and non-urban sources that are distinguished {{on the basis}} of CH 3 CN and CO. In order to account for dilution in the urban plume, aerosol concentrations are normalized to CO which is taken as an inert tracer of urban emission, proportional to the emissions of <b>aerosol</b> <b>precursors.</b> Time evolution is determined with respect to photochemical age defined as −Log 10 (NOx/NOy). The geographic distribution of photochemical age and CO is examined, confirming the picture that Mexico City is...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent {{aircraft}} {{studies showed}} that new particle formation (NPF) is very active in the free troposphere. And, these observations lead to a new question: when does NPF not occur? Here, we provide case studies to show how different meteorological parameters affect NPF in the upper troposphere, using the aerosol size distributions measured at latitudes from 18 ° N? 52 ° N and altitudes up to 14 km during the NSF/NCAR GV Progressive Science Missions. About 95 % of the total samples showed the NPF feature with median number concentrations of particles with diameters from 4 to 9 nm (N 4 ? 9), 288 ± 199 cm ? 3, and the total particle number concentrations with diameters from 4 to 2000 nm (N 4 ? 2000), 500 ± 259 cm ? 3. Surface areas were in general very low in the free troposphere, 1. 58 ± 0. 87 ?m 2 cm ? 3, which in part explains the high frequency of NPF measured in this region, {{but there was no}} distinctive difference in surface area for the NPF and non-NPF cases. Our case studies show that rather airmass history is more important for nucleation in this region. Weak- or non-events did not display uplifting of airmasses. On the other hand, strong NPF events were usually associated with uplifting of airmasses, although there were also NPF cases in which uplift did not occur, consistent with the previous observations (Young et al., 2007). NPF tends to easily occur in the free troposphere because of low surface areas and low temperatures (Carslaw and Kärcher, 2006), but because of the low <b>aerosol</b> <b>precursors</b> in this region, vertical motion (that can bring higher concentrations of <b>aerosol</b> <b>precursors</b> from low altitude source regions to higher altitudes) can play a critical role. Latitude dependence of new particles also shows higher particle concentrations in the midlatitude and subtropics tropopause region than in the tropics, consistent with Hermann et al. (2003) ...|$|R
