40|$|Objective. Although many {{individual}} health behaviours {{have been}} implicated in the current rise in obesity levels, their confounding or cumulative effects {{have yet to be}} established. This study <b>piloted</b> a <b>measure</b> of multiple risk factors for obesity, designed to assess their relative importance at individual and population levels. Methods. A 100 -item, user-friendly, self-report questionnaire, was completed by 80 adult volunteers (67 % female, age range 19 - 73 years), and related to Body Mass Index (BMI). Results. Dietary factors significantly related to BMI were higher amount of food consumption and more non-hunger related eating. BMI was strongly related to both negative attitudes/emotions towards and negative social influences on physical activity/exercise. Higher BMI was also related to less participation in physical activity/exercise, more sedentary leisure pursuits (e. g. TV watching) and lower general activity levels (e. g. more car usage). A regression analysis of all risk factors explained around 56 % of the variance in BMI. Conclusion. The <b>pilot</b> <b>measure</b> was able to differentiate between weight groups on a number of risk factors. The strong associations found between BMI and attitudes, emotions and social influences on eating and activity behaviours may help explain why many diet and exercise regimes are unsuccessful. Practice implications.

40|$|Media {{literacy}} has {{the potential}} to alter outcomes in various fields, including education, communication, and public health. However, measurement of media literacy remains a critical challenge in advancing this field of inquiry. In this manuscript, we describe the development and testing of a <b>pilot</b> <b>measure</b> of media literacy. Items were formed based on a composite conceptual model and administered to college communications students (n = 34). Each of three media literacy subscales had good internal consistency reliability (α(1) = 0. 74, α(2) = 0. 79, α(3) = 0. 75). Principal components analysis revealed a five-factor structure that corresponded closely with the underlying conceptual model. As was expected, the media literacy scale was significantly correlated with a composite critical thinking measure (r = 0. 32, P =. 03). This scale may be valuable for the measurement of media literacy and the assessment of media literacy interventions...|$|R

Using a custom-designed tiling array and a new computational approach, we <b>piloted</b> <b>measuring</b> allele- and strand-specific expression in yeast. Confident quantitative estimates of allele-specific expression were obtained for about half of the coding and non-coding transcripts of a heterozygous yeast strain, of which 371 transcripts (13 %) showed significant allelic differential expression greater than 1. 5 -fold. The data revealed complex allelic differential expression on opposite strands. Furthermore, combining allele-specific expression with linkage mapping enabled identifying allelic variants that act in cis and in trans to regulate allelic expression in the heterozygous strain.

While the general formulas underestimated the difficulty of health records by placing them at the same grade levels as consumer health texts, our method rated health records as the most difficult type of documents.

40|$|Handling qualities {{research}} largely {{depends on}} {{the understanding of the}} pilot`s behavior in the control loop. Established pilot models are {{based on the idea that}} the pilot tries to achieve target conditions, e. g. a specific attitude. In 2004, Gray introduced a new theory which considers the pilot as someone who tracks away from threatening conditions (boundaries) when they become dominant. It is assumed that the control inputs are then based on the estimated time to boundary impact instead of the perceived control error. This so-called Baundary Avoidance Tracking (BAT) theory covers a new aspect of pilot behavior. This report give a comprehensive overview of the test concept and the evaluation strategy. Chapter 1 explains the rationale and provides an overview of central aspects of the study. Chapter 2 introduces the simulator environment including hardware aspects and the choice of aircraft dynamics and target movements. Chapter 3 covers the test conduction including the responsibilities of the flight test engineer. Specifics for the conduction of all test points are covered in this section. Chapter 4 introduces the algorithms used for automated data slicing after the tests. Chapter 5 presents the evaluation algorithms used for individual pilot data. The focus lies on tracking performance and pilot gain in multiple variations. Chapter 6 shows the evaluation which is performed with all data points from all pilots. This includes validity checks for potential <b>pilot</b> gain <b>measures,</b> the creation of a pilot gain ranking for the participating pilots and detection of their individual pilot gain range.

Although similar in the types of attributions made, cause was distinguished from responsibility and blame, which were indistinguishable from each other. Attributions did not change. Additionally, JWB were weakly correlated with pain intensity, and analyses of variance techniques found JWB to interact with pain duration, such that those with 1 month- 2. 5 years' duration had stronger JWB than those in the 3 - 9 years' duration. JWB did not interact with attributions or adjustment, but chi-square analyses found attributions interacted with adjustment, such that attributions to the self were adaptive, while attributions to others resulted in poor adjustment to pain. Stepwise multiple regression analyses suggested that these latter attributions predicted pain intensity, as did pain treatments. Additionally, individual differences in attributions, adjustment and pain intensity emerged in chi-square analyses, although none were found on JWB.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{developed}} a <b>pilot</b> neuropsychological screening <b>measure,</b> called the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status for Children (RBANS-C) {{which is designed}} to be used with children between five and ten years of age. This <b>pilot</b> <b>measure</b> was trialled on a sample of 30 New Zealand primary school children to evaluate its screening ability for children. It is based on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) which is used to screen adults for neurocognitive deficits. Like the RBANS, the RBANS-C is made up of a battery of subtests that assess five cognitive domains, including attention, immediate and delayed memory, visuospatial/constructional abilities and language. Some of the subtests of the RBANS-C were altered to be more suitable for children while others were left the same as in the RBANS. The results from the pilot tryout indicated that some subtests have adequate psychometric properties while others do not. This is most likely due to the small sample size and to a lack of some research controls as well as to inadequacies of some of the subtests. Nevertheless, the results suggest that the RBANS-C seems to identify children with cognitive difficulties, and to some extent isolate those difficulties. No significant sex differences but some considerable age variations were observed since the measure lacks any adjustments for age effects which further improvements of the RBANS-C should incorporate. Also, future research on the RBANS-C will need to develop an alternative form and make necessary modifications to make the RBANS-C an effective neuropsychological screening tool for school children...|$|R
