5|$|On February 17, 1863 Wilson {{introduced}} <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> federally fund {{elementary education}} for African American youth in Washington D.C. President Lincoln signed the bill into law on March 3, 1863.|$|E

5|$|On April 10, 2014, Maloney {{introduced}} the Human Trafficking Prevention Act (H.R. 4449; 113th Congress), <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> require regular training and briefings for some federal government personnel {{to raise awareness}} of human trafficking and help employees spot cases of it.

5|$|On February 5, 2013, Colorado {{representative}} Jared Polis introduced Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2013 (H.R. 499; 113th Congress), <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> decriminalize marijuana on {{the federal}} level, instead treating it as a substance to be regulated {{in a similar manner}} to alcohol. The act has not been approved by Congress.|$|E
5|$|Stanley's {{administration}} {{was affected by}} the United States' entry into World War I. The legislature established and funded a state Council of Defense, but Stanley vetoed <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have banned the teaching of German in public schools.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, 2014, Senator Bernie Sanders, {{independent}} of Vermont, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, announced <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow veterans who wait {{for health care}} for more than 30 days or who live more than 40 miles from a VA facility to instead see private doctors who already provide services through other government programs.|$|E

5|$|The {{most recent}} {{source of income}} from the lands, an {{extension}} of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000, was last renewed in 2013 but at vastly reduced spending levels, leaving some counties scrambling to find new sources of funding. In late 2013, the United States House of Representatives was considering <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> resume the funding and increase timber harvests to provide additional income to the counties.|$|E
5|$|During Washington's administration, the President {{was given}} broad powers for {{removing}} {{officials in the}} executive branch. Congress passed a bill sponsored by James Madison that gave the President the power to remove public officials whose appointments mandated Senatorial approval. In 1789, Vice President John Adams cast the deciding vote in the Senate against <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have mandated senatorial consent {{for the removal of}} Senate-confirmed federal and cabinet appointments. The bill had been sponsored by Pennsylvania Senator William Maclay.|$|E
5|$|Knott's {{most notable}} {{action as a}} {{legislator}} occurred {{near the end of}} his first stint in Congress. On January 27, 1871, he delivered a satirical speech ridiculing <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have provided fifty-seven land grants and financial concessions to railroads to further their westward expansion. In the speech, Knott singled out the Bayfield and St. Croix Railroad's proposed line from the St. Croix River to Duluth, Minnesota to make his point. He derided the remoteness of the town and the need for a railroad to it by repeatedly referring to a map and asking where Duluth was located. Following the speech, the railroad bill was killed and Congress adjourned for the day.|$|E
50|$|In August 2014 Shea-Porter {{voted against}} <b>an</b> {{immigration}} <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> increase funding for border protection and more administrative support.|$|R

5|$|Ryan opposes {{same-sex}} marriage, {{had previously}} supported a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, opposed {{the repeal of}} the don't ask, don't tell policy, voted against same-sex couples adopting children in Washington D.C., and voted against <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> expand federal hate crime laws to cover offenses based on a victim's sexual orientation. Unlike most of his fellow Republicans, Ryan voted in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in 2007, which would have prohibited employment {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation.|$|E
5|$|The state's liquor {{prohibition}} law was a {{major political}} issues at the time, and Talbot was a strict prohibitionist. During this term he vetoed <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have disbanded the state police, which were charged with the law's enforcement, and also vetoed a bill replacing prohibition with a licensing scheme. In the 1874 election, anti-prohibition Republicans joined with Democrats to elect William Gaston over Talbot by a narrow margin. The election marked a watershed in post-Civil War Massachusetts, since {{it was the first}} victory for a Democrat in that period, and exposed the state Republican Party's fractures on domestic affairs like prohibition. Talbot refused to run in 1875.|$|E
5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have {{provided}} funds {{to protect the}} site failed, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an Executive Order that authorized funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to build a levee around the site {{to protect it from}} the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left the dig, leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the site was completely underwater, due to the seepage of thick layers of gravel that had not been accounted for. However, as the site was being flooded, the excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel in the hopes of being able to return to the dig in the future.|$|E
50|$|In 1968, Reinstein {{was elected}} to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. In March 1969 he {{introduced}} <b>a</b> controversial <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have made dealing heroin a capital crime.|$|R
50|$|On March 19, 2015, Victoria Dooling, a Nevada state representative, {{proposed}} <b>a</b> bathroom <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{apply to}} public schoolchildren in the state. It later died in committee.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Kaynak caused {{controversy}} {{after he}} submitted <b>a</b> proposed <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> lift prison sentences from office-holders that had committed bribery and used their powers for personal gain.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{regulation}} of interstate commerce, especially as concerned the railroads, was a political issue. The call for regulation of the railroads divided the nation's business interests, with railroads working against legislation and manufacturers, who were aggrieved by high railroad rates, joining the reformers. Standard Oil joined the latter group in calling for Congressional action. In 1886, Payne voted for <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> reform railroad rates slightly, but was considered ineffective by reformers. After amendments by the House, however, the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices consumers and manufacturers found most egregious. Payne voted against the strengthened Interstate Commerce Act, which passed and {{was signed into law}} by President Grover Cleveland. In explaining his vote, Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping (such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes) over the railroads.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Stanley's {{election}} to the House, the American Tobacco Company had eliminated all its substantial competitors either by acquisition or by driving them out of business. The company worked with British tobacco manufacturers to set tobacco prices worldwide. Congressman Stanley came {{to the defense of}} the tobacco farmers of his district, making him virtually unbeatable as a congressional candidate. In the first of his five consecutive terms, he authored <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> remove an oppressive national tobacco tax, hoping this would help raise prices for unprocessed tobacco. The bill was defeated by extensive lobbying efforts by the American Tobacco Company. In 1904, he convinced the Ways and Means Committee to hold public hearings on the American Tobacco Company's monopolistic actions, but the hearings did not convince legislators to repeal the tax nor take action against the American Tobacco Company.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{has often}} been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural {{disaster}} to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed {{a lack of interest}} in federal flood control. Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, {{and that it would be}} seen as mere political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost. On the other hand, Congress wanted <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation. When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.|$|E
50|$|Paul {{supported}} <b>a</b> Kentucky <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> restore {{voting rights}} to felons after a five-year waiting period. The current system requires felons to petition the governor for a partial pardon.|$|R
5000|$|The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015 (...) is <b>an</b> {{appropriations}} <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> provide {{funding for}} the United States Department of Defense for fiscal year 2015 of approximately $491 billion.|$|R
2500|$|In May 2012, Earnhardt {{singled out}} Republican Representative Jack Kingston of Georgia while {{speaking}} against {{an amendment to}} <b>a</b> defense <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> prohibit the military from funding sponsorships in professional sports.|$|R
5|$|Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{have allowed}} the {{legislature}} to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; {{despite the fact that}} the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed the Senate had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The Senate finally confirmed this choice.|$|E
5|$|Fonseca chose both. First, the Brazilian Congress began {{negotiating}} with the mutineers, although this was not Fonseca's preferred solution—he and the Minister of the Navy Marques Leão began plotting a military solution. At the behest of Congress, José Carlos de Carvalho was appointed as a liaison to the rebels. Carvalho, a federal deputy and former naval captain, talked with the crew on all four ships and reported to Congress that the rebels were well led and organized—and their main armament was fully functional. His report showed that the sailor's complaints, especially about the lash, were well-justified and that a military option {{would be unlikely to}} succeed. By the afternoon on 23 November, the Brazilian Congress had begun work on <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> grant amnesty to all involved and end the use of corporal punishment in the navy.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, Paul filed {{to run for}} {{re-election}} to his Senate seat in 2016. Had he become the Republican presidential (or vice-presidential) nominee, state law would prohibit him from simultaneously running {{for re-election}}. In March 2014, the Republican-controlled Kentucky Senate passed <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow Paul to run for both offices, but the Democratic-controlled Kentucky House of Representatives declined to take it up. Paul spent his own campaign money in the 2014 legislative elections, helping Republican candidates for the State House {{in the hopes of}} flipping the chamber, thus allowing the legislature to pass the bill (Democratic Governor Steve Beshear's veto can be overridden with a simple majority). However, the Democrats retained their 54–46 majority in the State House. Paul has since given his support to the idea that the Kentucky Republican Party could decide to hold a caucus rather than a primary, potentially giving Paul more time to decide whether he should run for U.S. Senator or continue a potential bid for President.|$|E
50|$|In October 2015, Davies {{spoke for}} 93 minutes, thereby {{successfully}} blocking <b>a</b> proposed <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have given free hospital parking to carers. He had pledged {{his support for}} carers just four months earlier.|$|R
50|$|Republican House members {{proposed}} <b>a</b> “right-to-work” <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{have made}} it illegal for an employer to mandate that employees join a union. Lacking support from Republican Governor Mitch Daniels, the bill has died.|$|R
25|$|In December 2015, Goldsmith {{voted in}} support of the government's plans to expand the aerial bombing of Islamic State targets. He also {{endorsed}} <b>a</b> government <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have restricted trade union's abilities to strike.|$|R
