25|$|When {{correctly}} reared, llamas spitting at a {{human is}} a rare thing. Llamas are very social herd animals, however, and do sometimes spit <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> a way of disciplining lower-ranked llamas in the herd. A llama's social rank in a herd is never static. They can always move up or down in the social ladder by picking small fights. This is usually done between males to see which will become dominant. Their fights are visually dramatic, with spitting, ramming each other with their chests, neck wrestling and kicking, mainly to knock the other off balance. The females are usually only seen spitting {{as a means of}} controlling other herd members.|$|E
500|$|The video, which Beyoncé has {{considered}} intimate and romantic, begins as she stands against a wall, illuminated by light that {{passes through a}} window. In one scene, Beyoncé's character, dressed in a skin-tight leotard, performs a dance sequence while her love interest {{looks down at her}} from a balcony. According to Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly, the dance routines pay homage to the 1983 romantic drama film Flashdance. Beyoncé and Ealy later stare adoringly <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> they snuggle on a sofa. During the climax of the video, Beyoncé is shown underwater, dressed in white, moving slowly upwards. As the chorus begins, she opens her eyes; after Ealy kisses the back of her neck, the pair come face to face in the final scene, in which Beyoncé lies in bed, with Ealy above her. Jennifer Cady of E! Online wrote that the bright shiny lights in the video [...] "make [...] look like an angel". Alison Maloney of The Sun praised Beyoncé's [...] "amazing figure". The video was ranked at number 74 on BET's Notarized: Top100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E
500|$|The video's {{opening scene}} shows the sun rising and Rihanna waking up. Meanwhile, Ne-Yo walks along a street, {{wearing a hat}} that obscures most of his face. Rihanna is in her room; she is bored and {{wondering}} which clothes to wear, and she finds a gold necklace. As the song starts, Rihanna lies in bed and sings, while Ne-Yo continues walking along the street, approaches the hotel and cautiously looks around before entering it. Meanwhile, Rihanna dresses, leaves the room and walks through the hallway of the hotel. Ne-Yo goes in an elevator {{to the floor of}} Rihanna's room. As Rihanna waits near the elevator, it opens. Ne-Yo and Rihanna meet and smile <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> Rihanna enters the elevator and Ne-Yo exits. It is then revealed that Rihanna and Ne-Yo are not singing about each other, but different people. As the video progresses, Rihanna is downstairs, chanting the lyrics of the song and Ne-Yo is in a hallway. He knocks on a door, which his girlfriend opens, and he enters the room. Rihanna simultaneously climbs into her lover's car and they smile at each other. The video ends with the previous scenes showing Rihanna leaving her hotel room. A reviewer from MTV UK commented, [...] "After Shut Up And Drive the 19 year old is going even raunchier for this vid- writhing around on a bed in her underwear and pearls." ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Wrenn and {{he smiled}} <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> searchingly <b>as</b> the Portland boat pulled out, and a wind swept {{straight}} from the Land of Elsewhere.|$|R

2500|$|By this time, towards 8:30pm, {{the moon}} had risen. Moving slowly {{downwind}} {{away from the}} anchored ships, Pallas and Countess of Scarborough began a second battle of broadsides (which for Pallas meant 16 guns firing just over [...] of shot together). Hovering in the background, still, were Vengeance and the schooner, with the boarding party which John Paul Jones really needed. Captain Landais, of the Alliance, after observing for a time, formed another plan, and set off after Pallas. On the way, Alliance passed the two locked ships, still anchored, still firing broadsides <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> <b>As</b> the direction of shots was now predictable, Captain Landais could safely approach within firing range of Serapis, from the right direction- bow or stern rather than flank. This he did, firing a broadside including round-shot, bar-shot and grapeshot at Serapis’ bow. Right next to that bow, still, was Bonhomme Richard’s stern. As much lethal shot hit Jones’s men as Pearson’s, and metal also flew along Bonhomme Richard’s gun-deck, killing some of the remaining gunners and wrecking several gun-carriages. Landais then continued on his way.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{told the}} entire story, the men glancing triumphantly <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> he proceeded.|$|E
60|$|They looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> {{though a}} mist {{hitherto}} obscuring their faces {{had been blown}} away.|$|E
60|$|The combatants desisted {{from their}} encounter, but stood looking <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> sullenly, <b>as</b> men do {{in such a}} situation, each unwilling to seem to desire peace more than the other, and averse {{therefore}} {{to be the first}} to sheathe his sword.|$|R
60|$|The saises looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> gravely <b>as</b> they rubbed their ponies' legs. This was {{the time}} when long purses began to tell, and {{everybody}} knew it. Kittiwynk and the others came back, the sweat dripping over their hooves and their tails telling sad stories.|$|R
60|$|The two {{men looked}} <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> silent <b>as</b> death: Baldassarre, with dark fierceness and a {{tightening}} {{grip of the}} soiled worn hands on the velvet-clad arm; Tito, with cheeks and lips all bloodless, fascinated by terror. It seemed a long while to them--it was but a moment.|$|R
60|$|They looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>as</b> {{they walked}} away and sneered. One {{of them was}} Sir Henry Ashton's uncle.|$|E
60|$|Jennings obeyed promptly. Stephen filled both glasses, {{and the two}} {{men looked}} <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> they held them out.|$|E

60|$|They looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> much <b>as</b> if {{they had}} {{unexpectedly}} met at the altar; but after a momentary start Paula did not flinch from the position into which hurt pride had betrayed her. De Stancy bowed gracefully, and she merely walked to the furthest window, whither he followed her.|$|R
6000|$|... "You didn't suppose I {{had asked}} her?"

60|$|Pierre and I looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> questioningly, <b>as</b> if {{asking whether}} the old negro had {{suddenly}} taken leave of his senses, for it seemed impossible {{he could have}} gathered information which was of the greatest importance to us, while we who had been moving around through the encampment had failed to hear anything of the kind.|$|R
30|$|Silvana and {{her father}} {{exchange}} looks and gaze with much intensity as they develop affective connections, this a strong motive which is love, the love parents have for children, and the love babies are able to express through reciprocally gazing <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Silvana <b>as</b> little as six weeks learns about ‘gaze’ is an important dimension of affectively connecting with people.|$|R

60|$|Well, this memorable battle {{continued}} to rage until {{the ground was}} strewn with helmeted heads that had been cut off.

6000|$|... "That is {{more than}} I can tell thee, lad.
