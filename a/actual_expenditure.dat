50|$|The system {{operated}} was defective. The auditors did not audit the <b>actual</b> <b>expenditure</b> of {{the departments}} administering {{the army and}} navy.

Thus a person no longer in office, but with a balance in hand had no incentive to pay it back in to the Exchequer. Furthermore, an ancient Statute (51 Henry III, c.5) required that accounts should be cleared in order. This meant that work on auditing a later officer's account could not even begin until that of his predecessor had received its acquittance (Quietus).|$|E

50|$|For {{the mere}} {{purposes}} of commercial book-keeping, it matters, indeed, little in {{which way the}} general and shop establishment charges are dealt with, {{so long as they}} are eventually paid for out of the profits made on the work, that is to say, it matters little whether they appear in the books as chargeable to general revenue, or are allocated to the several items of work in progress in the shops. But apart from mere book-keeping, and to meet the requirements of the management for estimating, for controlling the efficiency of production and for comparing, period by period, the relative economy and efficiency of shop administration, it is absolutely necessary to keep the accounts of prime cost (meaning thereby the <b>actual</b> <b>expenditure</b> in labour and material directly incurred in the production of manufactured goods) entirely separate from the establishment charges (shop and general), so that the naked truth as to the cost of the operations which have taken place in the shops shall plainly appear {{on the face of the}} accounts.

50|$|As an {{underdeveloped}} country goes through its development process, labor is reallocated from the agricultural {{to the industrial}} sector. More the rate of reallocation, faster is the growth of that economy. The economic rationale behind this idea of labor reallocation is that of faster economic development. The essence of labor reallocation lies in Engel's Law, which states {{that the proportion of}} income being spent on food decreases with increase in the income-level of an individual, even if there is a rise in the <b>actual</b> <b>expenditure</b> on food. For example, if 90 per cent of the entire population of the concerned economy is involved in agriculture, that leaves just 10 per cent of the population in the industrial sector. As the productivity of agriculture increases, it becomes possible for just 35 per cent of population to maintain a satisfactory food supply {{for the rest of the}} population. As a result, the industrial sector now has 65 per cent of the population under it. This is extremely desirable for the economy, as the growth of industrial goods is subject to the rate of per capita income, while the growth of agricultural goods is subject only to the rate of population growth, and so a bigger labor supply to the industrial sector would be welcome under the given conditions. In fact, this labor reallocation becomes necessary with time since consumers begin to want more of industrial goods than agricultural goods in relative terms.|$|E

A retrospective, nonexperimental approach was used to analyze claims data from Georgia Medicaid claims files for all program-eligible persons for each relevant time period (intent-to-treat basis). These included all non-Medicare, noninstitutionalized Medicaid aged-blind-disabled adults older than 18 years of age. Comparisons of health care expenditures and utilization were made between base year (2003 – 2004) and performance year one (2006 – 2007), and of the difference between <b>actual</b> <b>expenditures</b> incurred in the performance year vs. projected expenditures based on various cost inflation assumptions. Demographic characteristics and clinical complexity of the population (as measured by the Chronic Illness and Disability Payment System risk score) actually increased from baseline to implementation. <b>Actual</b> <b>expenditures</b> were less than projected expenditures using any relevant medical inflation assumption. <b>Actual</b> <b>expenditures</b> were less than projected expenditures by $ 9. 82 million when using a conservative US general medical inflation rate, by $ 43. 6 million using national Medicaid cost trends, and by $ 106 million using Georgia Medicaid's own cost projections for the non-dually eligible disabled segment of Medicaid enrollees.
