5|$|An <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> {{also made}} between Gawain's {{trial and the}} Biblical test that Adam {{encounters}} in the Garden of Eden. Adam succumbs to Eve just as Gawain surrenders to Bertilak's wife by accepting the girdle. Although Gawain sins by putting his faith in the girdle and not confessing when he is caught, the Green Knight pardons him, thereby allowing {{him to become a}} better Christian by learning from his mistakes. Through the various games played and hardships endured, Gawain finds his place within the Christian world.|$|E
5|$|Currently, astronomers {{know little}} about the shape and size of our galaxy {{relative}} to {{what they know about}} other galaxies; it is difficult to observe the entire Milky Way from the inside. A good <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> trying to observe a marching band {{as a member of the}} band. Observing other galaxies is much easier because humans are outside those galaxies. Steven Majewski and his team planned to use SIM Lite to help determine not only the shape and size of the Galaxy but also the distribution of its mass and the motion of its stars.|$|E
5|$|Peter Donovan criticises the language-games {{approach}} {{for failing to}} recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth. He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to be meaningful and true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> accepted, such a comparison between beliefs is impossible. Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the apologetics of some, demonstrates that they {{interact with each other}} and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Analogies</b> can <b>be</b> {{powerful}} teaching tools {{because they}} can make new material intelligible to students by comparing it to material that is already familiar. It is clear, though, that not all <b>analogies</b> <b>are</b> good and that not all good <b>analogies</b> <b>are</b> useful to all students. In order to determine which <b>analogies</b> <b>are</b> useful for students and how <b>analogies</b> should <b>be</b> presented to be useful for students, we interviewed biochemistry students about the <b>analogies</b> that <b>were</b> used in their classes. We found that most biochemistry students like, pay particular attention to, and remember the analogies their instructors provide. They use these analogies to understand, visualize, and recall information from class. They argue, however, that <b>analogies</b> <b>are</b> not presented as effectively {{as they could be}} in class. We present their suggestions for improving classroom analogy use. [Chem. Educ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 168 - 170) In {{computer science}} {{there are many}} concepts which are relatively simple, but appear complex when described in the technical language and jargon. This makes it rather difficult for the beginners to understand and learn these concepts. Since <b>analogies</b> <b>are</b> often used processes or concepts, this thesis to clarify attempts to complex derive analogies for use in explaining selected computer science concepts, based on similarities with other familiar concepts or ???real-life??? activities. About 70 <b>analogies</b> <b>were</b> compiled {{for use in the}} beginning courses on the following computer science material: data structures, data bases, architecture, operating systems, and networks. The <b>analogies</b> <b>were</b> evaluated in the spring semester, 1985, in several lower division computer science classes at the California State University, Northridge. Nearly all of the <b>analogies</b> <b>were</b> judged as ???very good??? or ???good??? by the instructors, and as ???clear??? by a large majority of the students, thus reinforcing the hypothesis that use of <b>analogies</b> <b>is</b> an effective teaching paradigm. A set of guidelines for deriving effective <b>analogies</b> <b>was</b> formulated, based on experience gained...|$|R
5|$|Thomas Aquinas {{argued that}} {{statements}} about God are analogous to human experience. An analogous term is partly univocal (has only one meaning) and partly equivocal (has {{more than one}} potential meaning) because an <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> {{in some ways the}} same and in some ways different from the subject. He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, {{it does not mean that}} God is good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.|$|E
5|$|Many {{covalent}} binary nitrides are known. Examples include cyanogen ((CN)2), triphosphorus pentanitride (P3N5), disulfur dinitride (S2N2), and tetrasulfur tetranitride (S4N4). The essentially covalent {{silicon nitride}} (Si3N4) and germanium nitride (Ge3N4) are also known: silicon nitride in particular {{would make a}} promising ceramic {{if not for the}} difficulty of working with and sintering it. In particular, the group 13 nitrides, most of which are promising semiconductors, are isoelectronic with graphite, diamond, and silicon carbide and have similar structures: their bonding changes from covalent to partially ionic to metallic as the group is descended. In particular, since the B–N unit is isoelectronic to C–C, and carbon is essentially intermediate in size between boron and nitrogen, much of organic chemistry finds an echo in boron–nitrogen chemistry, such as in borazine ("inorganic benzene"). Nevertheless, the <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> not exact due to the ease of nucleophilic attack at boron due to its deficiency in electrons, which is not possible in a wholly carbon-containing ring.|$|E
25|$|Electricity was {{originally}} {{understood to be}} a kind of fluid. This hydraulic <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> still conceptually useful for understanding circuits.

50|$|Relational <b>analogies</b> <b>are</b> {{opposite}} from formal analogies.

2500|$|The {{means for}} {{creating}} these <b>analogies</b> <b>is</b> intuition.

40|$|AbstractAnalogies {{have been}} an {{important}} part of chemistry education for many years. Especially, <b>analogies</b> have <b>been</b> used to teach abstract concepts like chemical equilibrium, nature of matter and chemical bonding. Accordingly, analogies plays central role in supporting the understanding of complex concepts and topics. One of the main sources of <b>analogies</b> <b>is</b> textbooks. The purpose of this study to examine analogies found in the 9 th and 10 th the grades chemistry textbooks. As a result of this study, {{it was found that the}} use of the <b>analogies</b> <b>were</b> limited in both 9 th and 10 th grades chemistry textbooks. Also, it was determined that these <b>analogies</b> <b>were</b> very simple...|$|R
25|$|Lastly, {{a formal}} <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> shown where the derivations {{of the concept}} triples are indicated. The diamond shape denotes analogy and can exist between any three topics because of the shared {{meanings}} and differences.|$|E
25|$|The {{drawback}} of the mechanical-electrical <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> that electronics {{are limited}} by the range over which the variables may vary. This is called dynamic range. They are also limited by noise levels. Floating-point digital calculations have a comparatively huge dynamic range.|$|E
25|$|Flexural slip allows folding by {{creating}} layer-parallel slip between {{the layers of}} the folded strata, which, altogether, result in deformation. A good <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> bending a phone book, where volume preservation is accommodated by slip between {{the pages of the}} book.|$|E
2500|$|The watchmaker <b>analogy</b> <b>was</b> {{referenced}} in the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial. Throughout the trial, Paley {{was mentioned}} several times.

40|$|Christensen, B. T. Analogy in {{real-world}} design <b>Analogy</b> <b>was</b> {{studied in}} real-world engineering design, using the in vivo method. Analogizing {{was found to}} occur frequently, entailing a roughly equal amount of within and between domain analogies. In partial support for theories of unconscious plagiarism (Brown & Murphy, 1989; Marsh, Landau, & Hicks, 1996) and Ward’s (1994) Path-of-least-resistance model, {{it was found that}} the reference to exemplars (in the form of prototypes) significantly reduced the number of between-domain analogies between source and target, compared to using sketches or no external representational systems. Analogy served three functions in relation to novel design concepts: identify problems, solve problems or explain concepts. Problem identifying <b>analogies</b> <b>were</b> mainly within-domain; explanatory <b>analogies</b> <b>were</b> mainly between-domain; while problem solving <b>analogies</b> <b>were</b> a mixture of within- and between-domain analogies...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the problems concerning the use of analogies in general and analogies used in primary school science and technology lessons in particular. In this study, descriptive method was used. 4 th, 5 th, and 8 th classes Science and Technology course books; 7 th, 8 th classes Science Books were used as a source. Analogies in the course books were classified according to the literature and the problems found related to the <b>analogies</b> <b>are</b> pointed out in the study. In this study it was seen that eighty-nine <b>analogies</b> <b>were</b> used in Science and Technology and in Science course books. These <b>analogies</b> <b>were</b> used in descending order as 8, 4, 6, 7, 5 class groups. Also it was seen that these <b>analogies</b> <b>were</b> generally at simple and pictorial analogies...|$|R
25|$|The {{words of}} the text which {{form the basis of}} the {{deduction}} from analogy must be free, i.e., they must be superfluous and non-essential, or they may not be used (מופנה להקיש ולדין הימנו גזירה שוה). This limitation of the gezerah shavah, however, to superfluous words is not generally recognized. Akiva considers the gezerah shavah valid when neither of the two words is superfluous (אינו מופנה כלל). According to Rabbi Ishmael, it is sufficient if the <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> free on one side (מופנה מצד אחד), i.e., if one of the two words forming the basis of the <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> pleonastic. Rabbi Eliezer alone requires both words to be superfluous (מופנה משני צדדים; comp. David Zvi Hoffmann, Zur Einleitung in die Halachischen Midraschim, p.6).|$|E
25|$|The ammonia {{molecule}} readily undergoes nitrogen inversion at room temperature; {{a useful}} <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> an umbrella turning itself inside {{out in a}} strong wind. The energy barrier to this inversion is 24.7 kJ/mol, and the resonance frequency is 23.79 GHz, corresponding to microwave radiation of a wavelength of 1.260cm. The absorption at this frequency was the first microwave spectrum to be observed.|$|E
25|$|D. ambrosioides {{is used as}} a leaf vegetable, herb, and {{herbal tea}} for its pungent flavor. Raw, it has a resinous, {{medicinal}} pungency, similar to oregano, anise, fennel, or even tarragon, but stronger. The fragrance of D. ambrosioides is strong but difficult to describe. A common <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> to turpentine or creosote. It has also been compared to citrus, savory, and mint.|$|E
40|$|Analogy pervades our {{everyday}} reasoning. No situation we encounter is {{exactly like a}} situation we have encountered previously, and our ability to learn and survive {{in the world is}} based on our ability to find similarities between past and present situations and use the knowledge we have gained from past situations to manage current situations. <b>Analogies</b> can <b>be</b> powerful teaching tools because they can make new material intelligible to students by comparing it to material that is already familiar. It is clear, though, that not all <b>analogies</b> <b>are</b> good and that not all good <b>analogies</b> <b>are</b> useful to all students. In this study, I have used textbook analysis, classroom observations, student interviews and instructor interviews to determine the role that analogies play in biochemistry learning. <b>Analogies</b> <b>are</b> an important teaching technique in biochemistry classes, being used more often in both biochemistry classes and textbooks than they are in high school chemistry classes and textbooks. Most biochemistry students like, pay particular attention to, and remember the analogies their instructors provide; and they use these analogies to understand, visualize, and recall information from class. Even though students like and use analogies, they do not understand what <b>analogies</b> <b>are</b> or the mechanism by which they improve learning. For the students, <b>analogies</b> <b>are</b> simply any teaching technique that eases understanding, visualization, or recall. Instructors, on the other hand, have a good understanding of what <b>analogies</b> <b>are</b> and of how they should be presented in class; but they do not use analogies as effectively as they should. They do not plan, explain or identify the limitations of the analogies they use in class. However, regardless of how effectively instructors present analogies in class, this study indicates that, in general, <b>analogies</b> <b>are</b> useful in promoting understanding, visualization, recall, and motivation in biochemistry students at all levels. They would be even more useful if students understood what <b>analogies</b> <b>are</b> and how they can be used to improve understanding of biochemical concepts. ...|$|R

25|$|A common <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> {{the sonic}} boom of a {{supersonic}} aircraft or bullet. The sound waves {{generated by the}} supersonic body propagate {{at the speed of}} sound itself; as such, the waves travel slower than the speeding object and cannot propagate forward from the body, instead forming a shock front. In a similar way, a charged particle can generate a light shock wave as it travels through an insulator.|$|E
25|$|When rain {{falls on}} the sukkah, one is not {{required}} to stay inside. The Mishna in Sukkah 28b compares rain falling on a sukkah to a master who receives a drink from his servant and then throws it back in the servant's face. The <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> that through the rainfall, God is showing displeasure with the performance of the mitzvah by not allowing the Jews to fulfill their obligation of sitting in the sukkah.|$|E
25|$|Argument by <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} {{used to assess}} the capacity of other animals to experience pain. This is based on the principle that if a non-human animal's responses to noxious stimuli {{are similar to those of}} humans, they are likely to have had an analogous experience. For example, if a pin is stuck in a chimpanzee's finger and she rapidly withdraws her hand, then argument by analogy indicates that like humans, she felt pain.|$|E

25|$|Aberration may be {{explained}} as the difference in angle of {{a beam of light}} in different inertial frames of reference.

25|$|The Klein bottle, proper, {{does not}} self-intersect. Nonetheless, {{there is a}} way to {{visualize}} the Klein bottle as being contained in four dimensions. By adding a fourth dimension to the three-dimensional space, the self-intersection can be eliminated. Gently push a piece of the tube containing the intersection along the fourth dimension, out of the original three-dimensional space. A useful <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> to consider a self-intersecting curve on the plane; self-intersections can be eliminated by lifting one strand off the plane.|$|E
25|$|The zero-phonon line is {{an optical}} analogy to the Mössbauer lines, which {{originate}} in the recoil-free emission or absorption of gamma rays from the nuclei of atoms bound in a solid matrix.

More technically, the key to the <b>analogy</b> <b>is</b> the symmetry between position and momentum in the Hamiltonian of the quantum harmonic oscillator. Both position and momentum contribute in the same way (quadratically) to the total energy.|$|E

40|$|Although {{supported}} by extensive anecdotal evidence, only recently design-by-analogy {{has been proven}} to occur often in problem solving and idea generation.
