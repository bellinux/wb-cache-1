5|$|The area {{displays}} some of {{the earliest}} urban settlements in Europe, with archeological sites showing continuous development from the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods. Major archeological finds include Early Helladic fortifications, Mycenaean era workshops and necropolis, a classical era amphitheater, and Paleochristian and Byzantine temples. Some of the earliest and best preserved specimens of Athenian Geometric pottery have been attributed to the Trachones workshop and are featured in museum collections, including two kraters on display <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Metropolitan</b> Museum of Art in New York City.|$|E

5|$|Wagner first {{conceived}} {{the work in}} April 1857 but did not finish it until twenty-five years later. It was Wagner's last completed opera and in composing it he {{took advantage of the}} particular acoustics of his Bayreuth Festspielhaus. Parsifal was first produced at the second Bayreuth Festival in 1882. The Bayreuth Festival maintained a monopoly on Parsifal productions until 1903, when the opera was performed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Metropolitan</b> Opera in New York.|$|E
5|$|With {{the trilogy}} complete, Puccini {{had to decide}} on {{a place for the}} premiere. In 1918, travel was risky and uncertain. Puccini {{received}} an offer from Buenos Aires which he refused, unwilling to have so complex a work first performed overseas in his absence. He finally agreed that the premiere could take place <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Metropolitan</b> Opera in New York, without his being there, on the basis of performing instructions which he supplied to the conductor. Gianni Schicchi proved to be the last opera completed by Puccini.|$|E
5|$|Among revivals in the 1950s and later, Hepokoski singles out as {{particularly}} notable the Glyndebourne productions with Fernando Corena and later Geraint Evans {{in the title}} role; three different stagings by Franco Zeffirelli, for the Holland Festival (1956), Covent Garden (1961) and the Metropolitan Opera (1964); and Luchino Visconti's 1966 version in Vienna. A 1982 production by Ronald Eyre, more reflective and melancholy than usual, was staged in Los Angeles, London and Florence; Renato Bruson was Falstaff and Giulini conducted. Among more recent players of the title role Bryn Terfel has taken the part at Covent Garden in 1999, in a production by Graham Vick, conducted by Bernard Haitink. and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Metropolitan</b> Opera in {{a revival of the}} Zeffirelli production, conducted by James Levine in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Comparisons {{were made}} between Lander's Peak and The Heart of the Andes, a {{contemporary}} painting {{by one of}} Bierstadt's main rivals in the landscape genre, Frederic Edwin Church. The two works represented the two great mountain ranges spanning North and South America. At the New York Metropolitan Fair in 1864, held by the United States Sanitary Commission {{to raise money for}} the Union war effort, the two paintings were exhibited opposite each other. Lander's Peak and The Heart of the Andes are still exhibited on opposite walls at their current location <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Metropolitan.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} three years, {{according}} to the calculations of Mahler's friend Guido Adler the Eighth Symphony received a further 20 performances across Europe. These included the Dutch premiere, in Amsterdam under Willem Mengelberg on 12March 1912, and the first Prague performance, given on 20March 1912 under Mahler's former Vienna Hofoper colleague, Alexander von Zemlinsky. Vienna itself {{had to wait until}} 1918 before the symphony was heard there. In the US, Leopold Stokowski persuaded an initially reluctant board of the Philadelphia Orchestra to finance the American premiere, which took place on 2March 1916. The occasion was a great success; the symphony was played several more times in Philadelphia before the orchestra and choruses travelled to New York, for a series of equally well-received performances <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Metropolitan</b> Opera House.|$|E
5|$|George's silver jubilee in 1888 {{was celebrated}} {{throughout}} the Hellenic world, and Athens {{was decorated with}} garlands for the anniversary of his accession on 30 October. Visitors included the Crown Prince of Denmark, the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, Grand Dukes Sergei and Paul of Russia, and Djevad Pasha from the Ottoman Empire, who presented the King with two Arabian horses as gifts. Jubilee events in the week of 30 October included balls, galas, parades, a thanksgiving service <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Metropolitan</b> Cathedral of Athens, and a lunch for 500 invited guests in a blue and white tent on the Acropolis.|$|E

5|$|He was {{introduced}} to complex flamenco techniques by Spanish guitarist Paco de Lucía when the two shared a loft and performed together for the jet set in New York City in the early 1970s. In 1982, Laucke was selected by Andrés Segovia to perform for the PBS network <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Metropolitan</b> Museum of Art in New York City. He became Segovia's pupil, and studied with other classical guitar players including Julian Bream and Alirio Díaz.
