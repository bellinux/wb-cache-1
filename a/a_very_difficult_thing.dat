25|$|While some whites {{responded with}} {{violence}} or exploitation of Mexicans, another recurring effort was Americanization. Since many Mexicans were now {{a part of}} the United States, it was expected that they would act like Americans. The national language in the U.S. is English, so it was thought that the Mexican Americans should be speaking English like the rest of Americans. In 1907, United States’ President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, “We have room for but one language in this country, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house”. It was clear that a lot of Americans were hostile towards Spanish speaking Mexicans. The English Only movement is a political movement for establishing English as the only official language in the U.S., and using only English in official government operations. Learning a new language as an adult is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to do, so this effect of imperialism was challenging for a lot of new Americans.|$|E

It is widely used in learning, business, and open talk. In order to attract audience, presenter must have a good presentation skills. But presenting by using manual controller such as mouse and keyboard will affect the presentation flows. Presenter need to control their own slideshow yet they need to communicate with the audience. Presenter need to move freely while doing a presentation otherwise the audience will get bored with the presentation or even worse the presenter will lose their attention. Controlling the slideshow without effecting their presentation skill is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> to do. Based on the observation and research, to solve this problem, presenter need something that they can use to control their slideshow remotely while reducing the interruption with their presentation flows. Developing a mobile application that can control the slideshow with various type of controlling option {{is the best way to}} solve this problem. Mobile application is suitable for current daily activity. Because people nowadays used smartphone and bring their smartphone everywhere even at working space. Therefore, mobile application is the best solution to what medium user need to use to control their slideshow remotely. Testing the finished product to a group of target user will help improve any bug or error before it will released as a finished product. It is the best way to identify any problem or improvement by testing the product using the target user. The finished product will help improve the presentation flows of the presenter that used this slideshow remote control. Further improvement of this product will involve in new development of a new mobile application or new version of the current product...|$|R

In the end, he lacks the self-confidence to face her and feels he subconsciously is her. When asked about [...] "Creep" [...] in 1993, Yorke said: [...] "I have a real problem being a man in the '90s...

In Greek poetry of the great ages I only {{remember}} one piece which can be called a model--the AEolic verses that Theocritus wrote to accompany {{the gift of the}} ivory distaff. It was a present, you remember, to the wife of his friend Nicias, the physician of Miletus. The Greeks of that age kept their women in almost Oriental reserve.

But there is safety in a spinning instrument, and all the compliments to the lady, [...] "the dainty-ankled Theugenis," [...] turn on her skill, and industry, and housewifery.

And this song in {{particular}} is about the difficulty in having faith in things, and finding things to have faith in, in yourself, in God, in like he said, a woman. Faith is a weird thing, it in a sense {{it is all about}} waiting. It’s not actually about getting anything, you know, faith is about the wait, because once you get something there is no need anymore. So a lot about faith is just the willingness to sort of throw yourself on a fence and hang there for a while. That’s <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> and bitter <b>thing,</b> you know. In this song, I keep saying the main character, *I*, I said, “All my sins, I would pay for them if I could come back to you.” It’s not just about finding things to believe in, it’s about wanting to be able to believe in anything too. And it’s about all the voices that get inside your head and whisper for you to do it or not to do it as well. And it’s called “Angels of the Silences.” ...|$|R

He thought, he said, that we should be working at something that would do good to other people, at something by which we might show that in all labour there was something noble. Well, we were a good deal moved, and said we would do anything he wished. So he went out round Oxford and found two villages, Upper and Lower Hinksey, and between them there lay a great swamp, so that the villagers could not pass {{from one to the other}} without many miles of a round.

5000|$|The scene {{involving}} Owen violently attacking Denise prompted 128 {{complaints from}} viewers, who believed {{it should not}} have been shown before the 9 p.m. watershed. The programme's executive producer, Kate Harwood, defended the scene, saying, [...] "in tackling the issue of domestic violence, it was important to reflect realistically the sort of violence suffered by the victims in these sorts of situations, rather than to put a gloss on it. We therefore took great care to signal the nature of the episode's content in advance." [...] However, she acknowledged that some viewers would have found the scenes disturbing. Luton South MP Margaret Moran, a member of the all-party parliamentary group on domestic violence, insisted the storyline illustrates real life and may encourage victims to speak out and get help, saying, [...] "we can't hide these things away no matter what time of day it is. ... Even though this episode was shown before the watershed it will have had a real resonance with children, showing them that they are not alone and can get help. EastEnders will have put contact numbers {{at the end of the}} episode for people who are experiencing domestic violence to call. This is based on the guidelines for the BBC I helped to write." [...] Jeff Gardner of Victim Support Bedfordshire, also supported the storyline, saying [...] "Dealing with domestic violence is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> sensitive and <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to do. EastEnders has a large audience and if they were to sensitively raise the issues of domestic violence in the home and how people can get support in relation to it, then I would think that most people would want to support that." ...|$|R
60|$|One summer {{afternoon}} in Oxford--'that sweet city with her dreaming spires,' lovely as Venice in its splendour, noble in its learning as Rome, {{down the long}} High Street that winds from tower to tower, past silent cloister and stately gateway, till it reaches that long, grey seven-arched bridge which Saint Mary used to guard (used to, I say, because they are now pulling it down to build a tramway and a light cast- iron bridge in its place, desecrating the loveliest city in England)--well, we were coming down the street--a troop of young men, some of them like myself only nineteen, going to river or tennis-court or cricket-field--when Ruskin going up to lecture in cap and gown met us.

And I felt that if there was enough spirit amongst the young men to go out to such work as road-making for the sake of a noble ideal of life, I could from them create an artistic movement that might change, as it has changed, the face of England. So I sought them out--leader they would call me--but there was no leader: we were all searchers only and we were bound to each other by noble friendship and by noble art. There was none of us idle: poets most of us, so ambitious were we: painters some of us, or workers in metal or modellers, determined that we would try and create for ourselves beautiful work: for the handicraftsman beautiful work, for those who love us poems and pictures, for those who love us not epigrams and paradoxes and scorn.|$|R

40|$|Ukoliko religija, kako to tvrde neki sociolozi religije, a s čijim se mišljenjem slaže i autor, ponekad biva i faktorom društvene dezintegracije, a ne samo društvene kohezije te ukoliko se kršćanstvo promatra u povijesnoj perspektivi, tada se zaista treba zapitati o odgovornosti kršćanstva u mnogim nemilim povijesnim događanjima. Teza o "pravednom ratu", formulirana od Augustina, koja je ljudima dala mogućnost prosuđivanja karaktera rata, nalazi se danas u velikoj krizi. Na trasi te teze opravdavani su križarski ratovi, kolonizatorski pohodi, europski vjerski ratovi reformacije. SVijetle primjere suprotstavljanja ovakvim pohodima europske ciVilizacije koja je nastupala uime kršćanskog Boga, a u biti protiv drugih naroda i vjera, ispisuju prvi borac za ljudska prava Bartolornš da Las Casas, kao i pokušaji akomodacije u Kini i Indiji ("malabarski obredi"). Danas stoga valja pozdravttt sve ekumenske i mirotvorne inicijative koje pokazuju da religije u borbi za mir trebaju ponovo otkriti svoje vlastite originalne etičke parametre. If religion, as some {{scientists}} claim and whose opinion the author share, {{is sometimes a}} factor of the social disintegration and not only of its cohesion, and {{if we look at}} Christianity from the historic point of view, then we should really ask ourselves about the responsibility of Christianity in many painful historic events. The thesis about "the just war", created by Augustinian, which gave people the opportunity to form their judgment about the character of war, finds itself today in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> situation. Many <b>things</b> were justified with the help of this thesis: the crusades, the colonial struggies, the big Reformation wars in Europe. Bartolorne da Las Casas, the first fighter for human rights and together with him, some attempts of accomodation in China and India ("The Malabar Rituals"), represent a bright examples of opposing the offensive attacks of European civilization which acted in the name of Christian God, but, in fact, against other nations and religions. That is the reason why, today, we should welcome all the ecumenical and peaceable initiatives which show that religions fighting for peace should discover again their own, original, ethical parameters. Wenn Religion, wie das einige Religionssoziologen behaupten, worin auch der Autor uberelnstlrnrnt, manchmal den Faktor der gesellschaftlichen Desintegration und nicht nur den der gesellschaftlichen Kohaslon darstellt, und wenn das Christentum vom geschichtlichen Standpunkt betrachtet wird, dann muB die Frage nach der Verantwortung des Christentums in vielen pe inlichen geschichtlichen Erreignissen geste lit werden. Die von Augustin formulierte These vom "gerechten Krieg", die Menschen die Moglichkeit gab, den Charakter des Kriegs zu bewerten, geriet heute in ene groBe Krise.
