5|$|In the strike-shortened 1982 season, the Giants {{lost their}} first two games before the strike, and their first game upon returning. They won their next three games to even their record at 3–3. Perkins then {{announced}} that he was leaving to take the head coaching job <b>at</b> <b>Alabama</b> after the season, and the team lost the next two games, effectively eliminating them from the playoffs (despite defeating the Eagles in the season finale to go 4–5). Taylor remained a bright spot, repeating as the league's Defensive Player of the Year. Young chose Bill Parcells, the Giants' defensive coordinator, as the team's new head coach.|$|E

5|$|LSU and Alabama {{first met}} on the field in 1895 and {{continuously}} since 1964. Prior to their 2011 game, Alabama held an overall lead in the all-time series with 45 wins to only 24 for LSU and five ties. Historically, LSU's main rival was Tulane and Alabama's were both Auburn and Tennessee. However, when former LSU head coach Nick Saban was hired in the same capacity <b>at</b> <b>Alabama</b> in 2007 season, the Alabama–LSU game became a major rivalry game for each school.|$|E
5|$|LSU and Alabama {{first met}} on the field in 1895, and have met {{annually}} since 1964. When former LSU head coach Nick Saban was hired in the same capacity <b>at</b> <b>Alabama,</b> their annual contest became, arguably, an even more heated rivalry than before. At {{the start of the}} 2011 season, Alabama was ranked No.2 and LSU was ranked No.4 in all of the major college polls, and prior to their annual meeting, each team defeated all eight of their opponents, and LSU moved into the No.1 spot after a victory over West Virginia. Statistically, the game matched two of the top defenses in both the SEC and all of college football.|$|E

5|$|In 1979 Tonelli {{failed to}} defend his US title in the 100m backstroke, but managed third in the event at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships in his final year of university. In his four years <b>at</b> <b>Alabama,</b> he was an eight-time All-American in the 100m and 200m backstroke. His triumph at the NCAA Championships came amid the {{backdrop}} of a teammate's death in a waterskiing accident during a social event {{with a group of}} fellow swimmers. Tonelli was driving the powerboat when he did a U-turn that resulted in his teammate being thrown off his skis and into the water. The boat's propellor then struck the man, who died due to severe cuts and blood loss.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, {{eighteen}} players each {{signed an}} individual National Letter of Intent to play college football <b>at</b> <b>Alabama.</b> The 2010 recruiting class was ranked nationally {{in the top}} five by several recruiting services including Rivals, Scout, ESPNU and CBS College Sports. Spring practice began on March 12 and concluded with the annual A-Day game on April 17. Televised live by ESPN, the Crimson team of offensive starters defeated the White team of defensive starters by a final score of 23–17 before 91,312 fans in Bryant–Denny Stadium. The game was decided after the end of regulation when Brandon Gibson caught a 39-yard touchdown pass from AJ McCarron in sudden death. For their performances, Marcell Dareus earned the Dwight Stephenson Lineman of the A-Day Game Award and Mark Ingram earned the Dixie Howell Memorial Most Valuable Player of the A-Day Game Award.|$|E
5|$|In Mitchell's {{first year}} of {{coaching}} <b>at</b> <b>Alabama,</b> the team compiled an 111 record and won the national championship {{in addition to the}} SEC championship. Over each of the next two seasons, they matched that 111 record, added two more SEC titles and finished inside the top-five in the polls. In 1976, which would be Mitchell's last with the team, they fell off a bit with a 93 record, but they still remained in the top-fifteen nationwide. Mitchell helped develop Leroy Cook who was a two-time All-America selection drafted in the 10th round of the 1976 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys and selected as one of two defensive ends on the All-time Alabama team named by Sports Illustrated in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Thanks to the {{interception}} {{in the end}} zone, Alabama's offense {{returned to}} the field at its 20-yard line, the regulation starting point after a ball is downed in the end zone. A deep pass by Zow fell incomplete, then Alexander ran for a one-yard gain. On third down, Zow completed a first-down pass to wide receiver Michael Vaughn at the Alabama 32-yard line. Zow then completed another first-down pass, this time to Freddy Milons <b>at</b> <b>Alabama</b> 45-yard line. Alexander rushed ahead for a one-yard gain, then Zow threw an interception to Tech defender Ryan Smith, who returned {{the ball to the}} Alabama 36-yard line. After the interception, Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, which pushed the Hokies back to their 49-yard line.|$|E

Croyle led the Crimson Tide to a #8 national ranking, a 10–2 record, and a 13–10 victory over Texas Tech in the Cotton Bowl Classic, where he shared the game's Most Valuable Player honors with teammate DeMeco Ryans. In his final season <b>at</b> <b>Alabama,</b> Croyle attempted a then-school-record 190 passes without an interception and {{a finalist for the}} Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award as the nation’s most outstanding senior quarterback. He became the first Alabama quarterback to start every game in a season since 1996.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the regular}} season, but before the postseason bowl game, Maryland lost two members of its {{coaching}} staff. On December 5, 2008, the school announced that defensive coordinator Chris Cosh would return to Kansas State to take over as assistant coach and co-defensive coordinator. He joined the staff of the recently re-hired Bill Snyder, who was Kansas State's head coach from 1996 to 2005. Cosh previously served under Snyder as his linebackers coach from 2004 to 2005. For the bowl game, Maryland appointed outside linebackers coach Al Seamonson as the interim defensive coordinator. Maryland also lost its special teams and tight ends coach, Danny Pearman, who was hired by new Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney. Pearman was a Clemson alumnus and played there as a tight end from 1984 to 1987. <b>At</b> <b>Alabama,</b> he coached special teams and the offensive and defensive tackles from 1990 to 1997, during which time Swinney played there as a wide receiver. For Maryland's bowl game, third-year intern Brian White acted as interim tight ends coach, and he assisted head coach Ralph Friedgen in directing the special teams.|$|E
