50|$|Classification of the <b>atheriniformes</b> is uncertain, {{with the}} best {{evidence}} for monophyly in the larval characteristics mentioned below. Their closest relatives {{are thought to be}} the Cyprinodontiformes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atheriniformes</b> are {{generally}} elongated and silvery in colour, although exceptions do exist. They are typically small fish, {{with the largest}} being the jacksmelt, with a head-body length of 44 cm, and the smallest species, such as the Bangkok minnow, being only 2 cm in adult length.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Atheriniformes,</b> {{also known}} as the silversides, are an order of ray-finned fishes that {{includes}} the Old World silversides and several less-familiar families, including the unusual Phallostethidae. The order includes at least 354 species. They are found worldwide in tropical and temperate marine and freshwater environments.|$|E
50|$|The Neotropical {{silversides}} are a family, Atherinopsidae, of fishes in {{the order}} <b>Atheriniformes.</b> About 104 species in 13 genera are distributed throughout the tropical and temperate waters of the New World, including both marine and freshwater habitats. The familiar grunions and Atlantic silverside belong to this family.|$|E
50|$|Following Nelson (2006), {{the family}} Melanotaeniidae {{includes}} the subfamilies Bedotiinae, Melanotaeniinae, Pseudomugilinae, and Telmatherininae, {{to demonstrate their}} monophyly. However, in a 2004 study, a different classification scheme classifies the families Bedotiidae, Melanotaeniidae, and Pseudomugilidae (also include Telmatherinine genera) in a suborder Melanotaenioidei. Thus, the number of families in <b>Atheriniformes</b> varies from author to author.|$|E
50|$|The Old World {{silversides}} are a family, Atherinidae, {{of fish in}} {{the order}} <b>Atheriniformes.</b> They occur worldwide in tropical and temperate waters. About two-thirds of the species are marine, and the remainder live in fresh water. The 74 species are in 13 genera. The genus Craterocephalus is the most diverse with 25 species. Four genera are monotypic.|$|E
50|$|Trumpetfish swim slowly, {{sneaking up}} on unsuspecting prey, or lying {{motionless}} like a floating stick, swaying {{back and forth with}} the wave action of the water. They are adept at camouflaging themselves and often swim in alignment with other, larger fishes. They feed almost exclusively on small fish, such as wrasses and <b>Atheriniformes,</b> by sucking them suddenly into their small mouths.|$|E
5000|$|Taxonomically, {{the family}} is {{currently}} treated as the sole member of the order Mugiliformes, but as Nelson says, [...] "there has been much disagreement concerning the relationships" [...] of this family. The presence of fin spines clearly indicates membership in the superorder Acanthopterygii, and in the 1960s, they were classed as primitive perciforms, while others have grouped them in <b>Atheriniformes.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Cyprinodontiformes [...] is {{an order}} of ray-finned fish, {{comprising}} mostly small, freshwater fish. [...] Many popular aquarium fish, such as killifish and live-bearers, are included. They {{are closely related to}} the <b>Atheriniformes</b> and are occasionally included with them. A colloquial term for the order as a whole is toothcarps, though they are not actually close relatives of the true carps [...] - [...] the latter belong to the superorder Ostariophysi, while the toothcarps are Acanthopterygii.|$|E
50|$|Stiassnyiformes is {{an order}} of bony fish (Teleostei) {{proposed}} in 2009. It includes the mullets (Mugilidae), the <b>Atheriniformes,</b> the Beloniformes, the Cyprinodontiformes and some families of the paraphyletic Perciformes, including the cichlids. The new taxon was named by {{the authors of the}} first description in honor of the curator of the Department of Ichthyology at the American Museum of Natural History Melanie Stiassny, which suggested in 1993 that the mullet are allied with damselfish and guppies.|$|E
50|$|F. pulvereus can {{withstand}} many biological and environmental stresses such as habitat degradation, predation, and limited food sources, due mainly to its evolution within certain habitats. Bayou Killifish {{have a very}} specific diet, but one that happens to contain a plethora of microorganisms that are crucial to its existence. F. pulvereus lives in primarily hostile environments, so predation is not necessarily an issue for survival. However, these fish are susceptible to the parasitic fluke worm, Calyptospora funduli. Common among many fish, especially Cyprinodontids, F. pulvereus has a very high rate of inhabitants of this parasite, with approximately 31% naturally infected. While serving as a host for the worm, Bayou Killifish are not vectors for the worm and thus cannot spread them to other organisms. The parasite can have many effects on the intestinal fortitude and reproductive abilities of the killifish, though current studies have shown little effect of Calyptospora funduli on the Bayou Killifish. Unlike fish who belong {{to one of the}} largest orders of vertebrates, Perciformes, killifish like F. pulvereus belonging to the orders <b>Atheriniformes</b> and Cyprinodontiformes are not naturally resistant to the infestation of Calyptospora funduli. Possibly a future threat for the Bayou Killifish C. fuduli shows no recent negative impact on F. pulvereus other than taking up significant space in the digestive tract. Other than a future mishap with this parasitic fluke worm, few threats are known to exist for the Bayou Killifish. F. pulvereus is a very stable species, and shows no degradation in the near future.|$|E

40|$|Molecular {{variants}} of GnRH {{were characterized by}} reverse-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography from brain ex-tracts of fish in three different orders: Synbranchiformes (swamp eel [Synbranchus marmoratus]), Cyprinidontiformes (platyfish [Xiphophorus maculatus] and green swordtail [X. helleri]), and <b>Atheriniformes</b> (Patagonia pejerrey [Odontesthes hatchery]). Also, pituitary gland extracts from the pejerrey O. bonariensis (<b>Atheriniformes)</b> were characterized. Eluted fractions were test-ed in radioimmunoassays with antisera specific to GnRH, in-cluding both antisera that detected only one form of GnRH and those that detected several forms. The results show that brain extracts obtained from all species contained the same three mo-lecular forms of GnRH, which were immunologically and chro-matographically undistinguishable from chicken GnRH-II, pejer-rey GnRH (pjGnRH), and salmon GnRH. This study supports the hypothesis that expression of these three forms is common in different fish orders and that pjGnRH is the main regulator of pituitary function in these fish. anterior pituitary, central nervous system, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, hypothalamic hormones, neuropeptide...|$|E
40|$|Descriptions and {{illustrations}} of {{stages in the}} larval development of two common sympatric freshwater fishes in streams of tropical northeast Queensland, the flyspecked hardyhead Craterocephalus stercusmuscarum stercusmuscarum and the purplespotted gudgeon Mogurnda adspersa are presented. Larval development is {{described in terms of}} ontogenetic changes in gross morphology, notochord morphology, pigmentation, finfold morphology and fin structure. Developmental changes during the larval period of C. s. stercusmuscarum are similar to other <b>atheriniformes,</b> especially the genus Melanotaenia. The highly variable development and advanced state at hatching of M. adspersa in tropical streams contrasts with larval development of disjunct populations of the same species in southern Australia and also with other closely related species of the Eleotridae described elsewhere. Larvae of M. adspersa can be distinguished from C. s. stercusmuscarum on the basis of six key characters: pigmentation, presence of a preanal ventral finfold, general body form and shape, number of postanal myomeres, notochord morphology at hatching and timing of swimbladder inflation. Characters that allow for the accurate discrimination between both of these species and other sympatric <b>atheriniformes</b> are identified. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{addition}} to the series of documents {{that we have been}} publishing on the "Atlas of Teleostei Otoliths for the Southeastern-Southern Brazilian region", in this volume we present the results of species of the orders <b>Atheriniformes</b> (1 species), Beloniformes (5), Beryciformes (2), Zeiformes (2), Syngnathiformes (2), Scorpaeniformes (9) and Tetraodontiformes (6). Features, measurements and indices were analyzed according to methodology used in anterior series. Three otoliths of each species have been illustrated and photographed whenever possible. The frequency of occurrence of each characteristic was calculated by total length classes (TL), and differences within and among classes have been analyzed applying the multiple χ 2 test (significance 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|The genus Atherina (<b>Atheriniformes,</b> Teleostei) {{includes}} five extant brackish {{and marine}} species that inhabit the eastern Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, and Caspian Sea. Several fossil species are {{known from the}} Mediterranean and Paratethyan basins. Here we describe a new fossil species, Atherina atropatiensis sp. nov., from Upper Miocene deposits of the intramontane Tabriz Basin in NW Iran, based on well−preserved, articulated skeletons from the Lignite Beds at Baghmisheh−Marzdaran, near Tabriz. The new fossil species closely resembles the Recent A. boyeri, the only extant spe− cies of Atherina in the Caspian Sea, from which it can be distinguished by the different relative development of the as− cending and alveolar processes of the premaxilla, and the mutual relationship between pleural ribs and dorsolateral pro− cess of the basipterygium. The systematic and zoogeographic affinities of A. atropatiensis indicate that the Lignite Beds of the Tabriz Basin were deposited in a euryhaline environment and that {{a connection between the}} intramontane Tabriz Basin and the Eastern Paratethys (Southern Caspian Sea) once existed...|$|E
40|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{variants}} {{were characterized}} by gradient reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and radioimmunoassays with different antisera in brain and pituitary extracts of pejerrey, Odontesthes bonariensis (<b>Atheriniformes).</b> The results showed that three forms of GnRH are expressed in brain tisuue: {{two of them are}} chromatographic and immunologically similar to cGnRH-II (chicken) and sGnRH (salmon) while the third GnRH appeared to be different from the eleven known forms of the vertebrate hormone. This novel form is the only variant present in pituitary gland extracts. The distribution of GnRH neurons and fibers in the brain was demonstrated with immunocytochemical methods using specific antisera. The results indicate that ir-GnRH perikaria were observed in three different nucleus: nucleus olfactoretinalis, nucleus preopticus periventricularis and in the midbrain tegmentum. Immunoreactive GnRH (ir-GnRH) fibers reached the three areas of the adenohypophisis: rostral pars distalis, proximal pars distalis and pars intermedia. A close association between ir-GnRH fibers with growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) cells in the pituitary gland was also demonstrate. Furthermore, colocalization of GnRH receptors with somatotropin and prolactin expressing cells in pituitary primary cell culture was also shown. Fil:Stefano, Andrea Virginia.

40|$|A master sex-determining gene, the Y chromosome-linked anti-Müllerian hormone (amhy) gene, {{has been}} {{described}} in two New World atheriniform species but little is known on the distribution, evolution, and function(s) of this gene in other <b>Atheriniformes.</b> Interestingly, amhy {{has been found to}} coexist with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), providing a unique opportunity to explore the interplay between genotypic and environmental sex determination. In this study, the search for an amhy homolog was extended to an Old World atheriniform, the cobaltcap silverside Hypoatherina tsurugae (Atherinidae). The full sequences, including the coding and noncoding regions, of the autosomal amh (amha) and a putative amhy were obtained. The deduced Amha and Amhy proteins comprised 511 and 340 amino acids (aa), respectively. PCR analysis with genomic DNA from wild adults and from laboratory-reared juveniles revealed a high, but not complete association of ∼ 95 % between amhy and maleness. The spatiotemporal expression of amhy and amha during gonadal sex differentiation was analyzed by qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH). amhy transcription (in amhy-positive larvae) started before and peaked during histological differentiation of the gonads whereas amha was negligible during the same period in both genotypes. These results demonstrate that the amhy, although with some structural differences in relation to the amhy of some New World atheriniforms, is strongly associated with maleness and probably important for testicular development in this Old World atheriniform. Thus, amhy is a candidate sex determination gene in cobaltcap silverside and it will be key to scrutinize the mechanism of sex determination in this species...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS. Salt {{marshes and}} similar tide-dominated {{habitats}} present an unusual challenge for reproduction of resident aquatic organisms. Strong currents, siltation and hypoxia can potentially contribute to reproductive failure through mortality {{of the eggs}} or flushing of the eggs and larvae from the habitat. Fundulus hetero-clitus, a small brackish water killifish, is a common resident of tidal marshes along {{the east coast of}} North America from Newfoundland to Florida. The reproductive strategy of this and related species is based on aerial incubation of eggs in the high intertidal zone. The eggs are resistant to desiccation and, when fully developed, hatch on immersion. Copulatory behavior and anatomy of accessory reproductive structures are adapted to placement of eggs in protected incubation sites. The gonads of both males and females mature rhythmically with an endogenous cir-casemilunar period, which is synchronized with the "spring " tides of new and full moons. Spawning occurs on high tides. Embryos develop in 9 — 15 days, and usually hatch on the succeeding spring tide series. Reproductive cyclicity in F. heteroclitus and related fishes ensures that spawning fish will have access to the high intertidal zone, thereby permitting aerial incubation of eggs. High intertidal spawning in fishes in-volves a complex reproductive strategy re-quiring adaptations in adults, eggs and lar-vae. The adults typically display reproduc-tive cyclicity that ensures sexual maturity at the times of most complete immersion of the intertidal zone, when spawning sites are accessible. In addition, eggs of intertidal spawners are adapted to resist desiccation and hatch only when immersed in water. Larval development is completed and the embryos are ready to hatch before a suc-ceeding spring tide series inundates the spawning sites. The fry are immediately free-swimming and able to survive in tide-marsh and shore-zone environments. Many high intertidal spawners belong to the order <b>Atheriniformes.</b> The Californi...|$|E
30|$|The {{practical}} matter of species delimitation is receiving increased attention considering {{the high rate}} of extinction of species along with the huge undiscovered biodiversity in a number of taxa (Sites and Marshall 2003, 2004; Bickford et al. 2007; Wiens 2007; Puillandre et al. 2011). In the Andean Altiplano, the second highest plateau on Earth (Babeyko and Sobolev 2005), the dynamic and complex geological history of the region has produced ecosystems {{with a high degree of}} endemism (Veloso and Bustos-Obregón 1982; Dyer 2000; Vargas et al. 2004), probably related to the extensive terraces and restricted mountain ranges that have originated since the Miocene (Wörner et al. 2000; Risacher et al. 2003; Strecker et al. 2007). For example, the diversity of the killifish of the genus Orestias Valenciennes, 1839 and the lunged aquatic snails of the genus Biomphalaria Preston, 1910 is hypothesized to be principally a consequence of the fragmentation of populations during the Middle and Late Pleistocene after the regression of several paleolakes that existed in the area (Lüssen et al. 2003; Vila 2006; Vila et al. 2011, 2013; Collado et al. 2011 a). West of this area, the Atacama Desert, the driest place in the world (McKay 2002; Vesilind 2003) with thousands of square miles of arid desert interrupted by occasional oases, is a hyper-arid system thought to be relatively simple ecologically and with low productivity (Noy-Meier 1973), but containing endemic species, for example, within the genus Basilichthys Girard, 1855 (<b>Atheriniformes),</b> that has allopatric distribution (Dyer 2000). Both regions harbor restricted and isolated hydrological systems ranging from springs on the banks of the Pacific coast along the Atacama Desert to watersheds situated at more than 4, 000  m altitude in the Andes. In some of these watersheds, it is possible to find gilded snails of the genus Heleobia Stimpson, 1865 (Courty 1907; Biese 1944, 1947; Hershler and Thompson 1992; Collado et al. 2011 b), subfamily Semisalsinae Giusti and Pezzoli, 1980 (Bouchet and Rocroi 2005), sometimes living in amazing conditions of water stress and habitat degradation (Collado 2012). The group is characterized by small species that live in marine, brackish, and freshwater environments, and whose shells generally are less than 10  mm in length (Biese 1944, 1947; Hershler and Thompson 1992). The species have a wide range of ecological tolerances and reproductive strategies (Marcus and Marcus 1963, 1965; Cazzaniga 1982 a; Martín 2002; Neves et al. 2010; Collado and Méndez 2011), and some of them serve as intermediate hosts in the life cycles of digenean trematodes (Etchegoin and Martorelli 1997; Simões et al. 2008, 2009, 2010; Alda et al. 2010; Merlo and Etchegoin 2011). Kroll et al. (2012) studied the phylogenetic relationships of species mainly distributed in the Altiplano region and its major internal Lake Titicaca, and this is the only phylogenetic study performed in the genus Heleobia.|$|E
