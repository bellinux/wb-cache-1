5000|$|Tracing garbage {{collection}} is not deterministic in {{the timing of}} object finalization. An object which becomes eligible for {{garbage collection}} will usually be cleaned up eventually, {{but there is no}} guarantee when (or even if) that will happen. This is an issue for program correctness when objects are tied to non-memory resources, whose release is an externally visible program behavior, such as closing <b>a</b> network <b>connection,</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>a</b> device or closing a file. One garbage collection technique which provides determinism in this regard is reference counting.|$|R

40|$|Introduction The sole Transport <b>Connection</b> (TC) <b>release</b> {{facility}} {{provided by}} the current ISO/IEC Connection-Mode Transport Service [ISO 8072] is an abrupt (and thereby possibly destructive) one. At present, in the OSI Reference Model [ISO 7498], the concept of orderly (or graceful) release is introduced at the session service level. So {{it is up to}} the peer session entities to make sure that there are no more in-transit data on the TC to which is assigned the session connection that is to be gracefully released before requesting the abrupt termination of this TC. Some people even think that there is no objective reason for providing <b>an</b> orderly <b>connection</b> <b>release</b> in any layer except the application layer (cf. Question 6 in [ISO SD 9]). They argue that peer application entities could ensure, by way of an exchange of application protocol control information, that there are no more data in transit on the presentation connection and could then safely perform an abrupt termination o...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an architecture for controlling a wavelength-routed optical network. The optical network provides reconfigurable connections {{that can be}} used to carry different types of data, at possibly different bit rates. <b>A</b> <b>connection</b> consists of <b>a</b> path in the network and a wavelength on each link in that path. This work focuses on the mechanisms for controlling the optical connections. Distributed control protocols are provided for setting up and taking down connections reliably. These protocols allow connection originators to obtain resources with high probability by minimizing reservation conflicts, allow connections to stay up even if controllers along the path in the network fail, ensure that controllers in the network have a consistent view of the state of each connection, and ensure that all resources taken up by <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> are <b>released</b> once the <b>connection</b> is taken down. Fast protocols are also proposed for handling link failures and wavelength failures on a link. Thes [...] ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBrain ischemia/reperfusion injury {{results in}} death of {{vulnerable}} neurons and extensive brain damage. It {{is well known}} that mitochondrial release of cytochrome c (cyto c) is a hallmark of neuronal death, however the molecular events underlying this release are largely unknown. We tested the hypothesis that cyto c release is regulated by breakdown of the cristae architecture maintenance protein, optic atrophy 1 (OPA 1), located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. We simulated ischemia/reperfusion in isolated primary rat neurons and interrogated OPA 1 release from the mitochondria, OPA 1 oligomeric breakdown, and concomitant dysfunction of mitochondrial dynamic state. We found that ischemia/reperfusion induces cyto c release and cell death that corresponds to multiple changes in OPA 1, including: (i) translocation of the mitochondrial fusion protein OPA 1 from the mitochondria to the cytosol, (ii) increase in the short isoform of OPA 1, suggestive of proteolytic processing, (iii) breakdown of OPA 1 oligomers in the mitochondria, and (iv) increased mitochondrial fission. Thus, we present novel evidence of <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between <b>release</b> of cyto c from mitochondria and disruption of the mitochondrial fusion...|$|R
