500|$|It was {{the first}} year since 1927 that the main race was not covered in full {{on any of the}} BBC's {{national}} radio networks. [...] Its 4.15pm start coincided with the conclusion of the FA Cup semi-finals, and it had been decided that the rowing would be broadcast in full on the BBC World Service and BBC Radio Oxford only. [...] Commentator John Snagge who had described every race since 1931 was disappointed: [...] "I {{do not want to be}} unreasonable but I am <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>surprised</b> that for an event like the Boat Race, with its tradition and history, the BBC cannot find 20 minutes on one of its four networks to carry it in full." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} of Homicide {{said the decision}} to evaluate the series after a four-episode season placed tremendous pressure {{on the staff of}} the show. Fontana said one-hour dramas need time to fully develop and allow audiences to become familiar with the characters. Fontana expressed frustration with NBC in some news interviews, claiming the networks seemed to lack the courage to either cancel or renew it: [...] "They will run it in a 10 p.m. time period for a month and then they'll kiss us goodbye. ... I'm used to this kind of treatment from NBC. I'm <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>surprised</b> they'd treat Barry Levinson the same way they'd treat me." [...] In other interviews, however, Fontana said he saw the decision as a sign of support: [...] "This is not just a casual action on NBC's part. It's a real statement to me that we have a possibility to return." [...] Levinson said he believed [...] "four shots are better than nothing", adding: ...|$|E

"All the Small Things", {{released}} in early 2000, became {{an even bigger}} success— it crossed over from alt-rock radio to contemporary hit radio, peaking at number six on Billboard Hot 100 and {{number one on the}} Modern Rock Tracks chart. This track stayed {{at the top of the}} Modern Rock Tracks chart for eight weeks and remained in the top 10 for 20 weeks. It also peaked at number two on the official UK charts, and within the top ten in Italy, Ireland, Austria, Sweden and Australia. The music video for [...] "All the Small Things" [...] parodies boy bands and contemporary pop videos, and features the trio participating in choreographed dancing and dressing up as members of Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees, and 'N Sync. [...] "I was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>surprised</b> it went over so well," [...] recalled Marcos Siega, director of the clip, commenting that he felt it would offend viewers of Total Request Live (TRL) and boy band fans. [...] "I think we had the opposite effect. In some ways, I think that video put Blink at that sort of pop level with those other bands. We were making fun of them, but it kind of became [...]" [...] At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, it was nominated for Video of the Year and Best Pop Video, and won Best Group Video.|$|E

2500|$|Cimino's next film, Heaven's Gate (1980), debuted to lacerating {{reviews and}} took in only $3 million in ticket sales, {{effectively}} leaving United Artists bankrupt. The failure of Heaven's Gate led several critics to revise {{their positions on}} The Deer Hunter. Canby said in his famous review of Heaven's Gate, [...] " [...] fails so completely that you might suspect Mr. Cimino sold his soul to the Devil to obtain the success of The Deer Hunter, and the Devil has just come around to collect." [...] Andrew Sarris wrote in his review of Heaven's Gate, [...] "I'm <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>surprised</b> {{that many of the}} same critics who lionized Cimino for The Deer Hunter have now thrown him to the wolves with equal enthusiasm." [...] Sarris added, [...] "I was never taken in... Hence, the stupidity and incoherence in Heaven's Gate came as no surprise since very much the same stupidity and incoherence had been amply evident in The Deer Hunter." [...] In his book Final Cut: Dreams and Disaster in the Making of Heaven's Gate, Steven Bach wrote, [...] "critics seemed to feel obliged to go on the record about The Deer Hunter, to demonstrate that their critical credentials were un-besmirched by having been, as Sarris put it, 'taken in.'" ...|$|E
