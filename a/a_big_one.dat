25|$|In 2014-15, Backlund faltered slightly, {{suffering}} through {{injuries and}} trade rumours; however, the Flames surprisingly skyrocketed up the standings {{en route to}} their first playoff berth in six years. Backlund's 10 goals and 27 points were just 11th and 12th on the Flames, but he only played 52 games in the regular season. He continued struggling into the playoffs, only posting one goal and one assist in eleven games played. The one goal that Backlund did score was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>one,</b> though, as it came in overtime of Game 3 of the Flames' second-round series against the Anaheim Ducks to give Calgary their first win past the first round in thirteen years.|$|E

But Heikkinen viewed his size as an asset: “My size had been a help rather than a hindrance.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to {{his role in the}} television series, Dale's comic book counterpart is among the longest surviving characters in the series, and he enters into a sexual relationship with Andrea. Kirkman asserted that it was necessary for writers to distance the development of Dale's television character from that in the comic: [...] "I have talked many times how much I like the difference between the comics and the show. There are going to be big plot lines that we may not necessarily get to, like the romance between Dale and Andrea. If you think you really want to read that story line, that's available in the comics, and I highly recommend you pick those up. The show {{is always going to be}} a different animal and the decision to kill Dale off was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>one</b> and it wasn't one that was made lightly." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Field, the {{transition}} from writing music for an adult rock band to writing children's music was not <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>one</b> for The Wiggles. [...] "The Wiggles music isn't all that far removed from {{what we did in}} The Cockroaches, just a different subject matter", Field stated. [...] "The Cockroaches sing about girls and love and stuff like that; The Wiggles sing about hot potatoes and cold spaghetti." [...] Moran stated that The Wiggles wrote songs they liked and would listen to, and then made them appropriate for children. [...] They approached simple and relocatable topics, such as food and nutrition, as teachers would in a pre-school setting, with simple melodies that were easy for children to sing and remember. [...] The group sang the same 60s-style pop as The Cockroaches, but with different lyrics, although they were not confined to songs about love and could write about anything that interested and excited young children, which was limitless. [...] The music they chose to write and perform was influenced by nursery rhymes, folk music, and rock songs of the 1950s and 1960s. [...] Page reported, [...] "First and foremost, we're entertainers". [...] The Wiggles captured the interest of children by first entertaining them, and then by presenting them with educational messages.|$|E

500|$|Andretti {{appeared}} in victory lane {{and later on}} the podium to celebrate his first victory {{of the season in}} front of the crowd; the win earned him $100,000. He was delighted to take the victory: [...] "Just an awesome day, a perfect day for Team Motorola, they did an awesome job,", and, [...] "This is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>one,</b> I'll tell you that. After the first lap, I thought the race was over for us. But it was a hard fought race". Tagliani, who finished in second place, stated it was a [...] "good day" [...] for his team and hoped he could continue his recent successes. Third-place finisher Fernández said it was a [...] "great day" [...] for himself and his team but was disappointed as he felt he could have won the race because of a problem at his final pit stop. However, he felt if his team kept building their momentum, and he believed he could challenge for more strong finishes and race victories. Zanardi was pleased with his fourth-place finish, saying it was more fun than at the previous round (the Grand Prix of Cleveland) and felt his engineers were helping him to build a competitive car despite his poor qualifying performances.|$|E
500|$|Thatcher was Leader of the Opposition and Prime Minister {{at a time}} of {{increased}} racial tension in Britain. Commentating on the local elections of May 1977, The Economist noted [...] "The Tory tide swamped the smaller parties. That specifically includes the National Front (NF), which suffered a clear decline from last year". Her standing in the polls rose by 11% after a January 1978 interview for World in Action in which she said [...] "the British character has done so much for democracy, for law and done so much throughout the world that if there is any fear that it might be swamped people are going to react and be rather hostile to those coming in", as well as [...] "in many ways [...] add to the richness and variety of this country. The moment the minority threatens to become <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>one,</b> people get frightened". In the 1979 general election, the Conservatives attracted voters from the NF, whose support almost collapsed. In a meeting in July 1979 with Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington and Home Secretary William Whitelaw she objected to the number of Asian immigrants, in the context of limiting the total of Vietnamese boat people allowed to settle in the UK to fewer than 10,000.|$|E
500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There {{are days}} {{like this one}} in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom of the}} Cipressa. I made it across at the bottom of the Poggio and the entire way I felt fantastic. [...] This is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>one</b> and has been running for over a century. It's extraordinary. I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E

500|$|The next {{race was}} {{just around the}} corner, and it was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>one.</b> The 1990 Xerox Challenge was {{organised}} by Robin Judkins {{as one of the}} sporting events to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. It was by far the hardest; the 22-day multi-sport event covered the length of the country—from Cape Reinga to Bluff—and included road cycling, kayaking, running, and mountain biking. There were 67 competitors, including 6 women, who embarked on the [...] challenge. While Lynch was the favourite for the women, she soon developed severe tendonitis and the race doctor threatened to pull her from the race if she refused to take an anti-inflammatory. She had no option but to take the medication if she wanted to remain in the race, and promptly ended up in Wellington Hospital from the reaction to the medication. Fortunately for her, the fellow competitors were stuck in nearby Makara Beach, waiting for the weather in Cook Strait to settle enough to enable the kayak section. After two days, organisers abandoned the plan for the kayak section and Lynch was well enough to rejoin the race. The event featured every night on prime time TV {{and by the end of}} it, the two winners had become household names in New Zealand: Lynch, and Steve Gurney. It was Lynch's hardest race over her entire career and contributes to her being regarded as a [...] "legend" [...] of the New Zealand mountain bikers.|$|E

Just like his first stint in the lead, he picked up another piece of debris that covered his grill. The third caution of the race flew on lap 44 for a single-car spin on the backstretch.

[...] Dallas stormed right back with an 11-play, 80-yard drive, featuring a 35-yard reception by Deion Sanders. [...] Troy Aikman finished the drive with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Michael Irvin. [...] Then Dallas lineman Leon Lett intercepted a screen pass from Favre on the Packers 13, and they scored another touchdown on Aikman's 4-yard throw to Irvin, giving the team a 14-3 lead. [...] However, Favre's first completion of the day turned out to be <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>one,</b> a 73-yard touchdown bomb to Robert Brooks. [...] Dallas was forced to punt on their next drive, and Antonio Freeman gave his team great field position with a 39-yard return, with an additional 15 yards coming from a facemask penalty on Jett. [...] This gave the Packers the ball on the Dallas 35, and two plays into the second quarter, Favre threw a 24-yard touchdown pass to tight end Keith Jackson.

She told Ameche {{in the show}} to [...] "get me <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>one...</b> I feel like doin' a big apple!" [...] This ostensible reference to the then-current dance craze {{was one of the}} many double entendres in the dialogue. Days after the broadcast, the studio received letters calling the show [...] "immoral" [...] and [...] "obscene" [...] by societies for the protection of morals. Several conservative women's clubs and religious groups admonished the show's sponsor, Chase & Sanborn Coffee Company, for [...] "prostituting" [...] their services for allowing [...] "impurity [...] invade the air". [...] Under pressure, the Federal Communications Commission later deemed the broadcast [...] "vulgar and indecent" [...] and [...] "far below even the minimum standard which should control in the selection and production of broadcast programs". Some debate existed regarding the reaction to the skit. Conservative religious groups took umbrage far more swiftly than the mainstream. These groups found it easy to make West their target. They took exception to her outspoken use of sexuality and sexual imagery, which she had employed in her career since at least the Pre-Code films of the early 1930s and for decades before on Broadway, but which was now being broadcast into American living rooms on a popular family-friendly radio program.
