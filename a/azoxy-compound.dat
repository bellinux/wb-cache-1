40|$|Abstract It is a {{challenge}} to attain high selectivity to azoxy-compounds in the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds as azoxy-compounds can be readily reduced to azo- and aniline compounds. We proposed a new solution to this challenge: gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on hydrotalcite (HT) support were used to catalyze the reduction under visible light irradiation at ambient temperature; and phosphate (PO 4 3 −) and metal (such as Ga 3 +, Fe 3 +, Zn 2 +) ions were incorporated into the HT support to moderate the reduction power of the catalyst avoiding the formation of azo- and aniline compounds. Very high <b>azoxy-compound</b> selectivity was achieved under green mild conditions. The photocatalytic activity strongly depends on the incident light wavelength and intensity, and we can further enhance the catalytic efficiency of this photocatalytic process by slight increase in reaction temperature (e. g. 10 – 20 °C). Moreover, high stability and recyclability of the catalyst were also observed under the investigated conditions. A plausible reaction mechanism was proposed based on the experimental results and literatures. The introduction of both phosphate and metal ions into HT support can prevent the further reduction of azoxy-compounds to azo-compounds or anilines and achieve excellent selectivity to azoxy-compounds. This study reveals that we may engineer a product chemoselectivity by tailoring the supporting materials, and may present a new strategy towards the development of versatile heterogeneous photocatalysts...|$|E

30|$|Compounds {{excluded}} from this concept: high potency genotoxic carcinogens such as aflatoxin-like-, N -nitroso-, and <b>azoxy-compounds.</b> Risk assessment {{of members of}} such groups requires compound-specific toxicity data [Guideline on the limits for genotoxic impurities, CPMP/SWP/ 5199 / 02, European Medicines Agency; Opinion on Use of the Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) Approach for Human Safety Assessment of Chemical Substances with focus on Cosmetics and Consumer Products, SCCP/ 1171 / 08, European Commission; ICH guideline M 7 on assessment and control of DNA reactive (mutagenic) impurities in pharmaceuticals to limit potential carcinogenic risk, EMA/CHMP/ICH/ 83812 / 2013, European Medicines Agency]. Any substance with positive Ames test should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. It must be mentioned that the TTC approach allows up to 120  μg for a single dose in a recent ICH document (ICH M 7) soon replacing current guidelines that suggests even room for extension of this concept [Multidisciplinary ICH guidelines including M 7].|$|R
