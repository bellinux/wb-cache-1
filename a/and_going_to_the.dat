25|$|Radio galaxies, and to {{a lesser}} extent, radio-loud quasars display a wide range of {{structures}} in radio maps. The most common large-scale structures are called lobes: these are double, often fairly symmetrical, roughly ellipsoidal structures placed {{on either side of the}} active nucleus. A significant minority of low-luminosity sources exhibit structures usually known as plumes which are much more elongated. Some radio galaxies show one or two long narrow features known as jets (the most famous example being the giant galaxy M87 in the Virgo cluster) coming directly from the nucleus <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lobes. Since the 1970s, the most widely accepted model has been that the lobes or plumes are powered by beams of high-energy particles and magnetic field coming from close to the active nucleus. The jets are believed to be the visible manifestations of the beams, and often the term jet is used to refer both to the observable feature and to the underlying flow.|$|E
500|$|Bush is of English, French, and Swiss ancestry. Her {{father was}} a home builder and later {{successful}} real estate developer, while her mother worked as the bookkeeper for her father's business. [...] Early on, her parents encouraged her to read, leading to what would become her love of reading. She said, [...] "I learned [...] at home from my mother. When I was a little girl, my mother would read stories to me. I have loved books <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> library ever since. In the summer, I liked to spend afternoons reading in the library. I enjoyed the Little House on the Prairie and Little Women books, and many others... Reading gives you enjoyment throughout your life." [...] Bush has also credited her second grade teacher, Charlene Gnagy, for inspiring her interest in education.|$|E

500|$|Lynch credits {{her being}} {{cast in the}} Harry Potter films to the {{obsession}} she had with the Harry Potter book series. At age 11, during {{the release of the}} fifth book Order of the Phoenix in June 2003, she was hospitalised and her family consulted with the book's publisher and the hospital. Lynch then was allowed to leave for an hour and collect a signed copy of the book. While some have stated that her prior correspondence with J. K. Rowling was a major contributing factor behind the casting decision, but this theory has been debunked by both Lynch and Rowling, confirming that Rowling was unaware of Lynch being cast in the role of Luna Lovegood until the producers mentioned Lynch's name. Lynch got the role by reading about the casting call on one of the many Harry Potter fan sites <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> open audition. In January 2006, Lynch auditioned at a casting call in London for the role of Luna Lovegood in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the fifth film in the series adapted from the books. [...] After auditioning against 15,000 other girls, and a subsequent screen test with lead actor Daniel Radcliffe, she was cast at the age of 14. Producers were impressed with her affinity for the character; David Heyman said: [...] "The others could play Luna; Evanna Lynch is Luna." [...] Although uninvolved in the casting process, Rowling believed that Lynch was perfect for the role. She had never acted professionally before the Harry Potter series, her experience having been limited to school plays.|$|E
