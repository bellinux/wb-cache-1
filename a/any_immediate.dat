5|$|Although Suzuki might {{indeed have}} seen peace as a distant goal, {{he had no}} design to achieve it within <b>any</b> <b>immediate</b> time span or on terms {{acceptable}} to the Allies. His own comments at the conference of senior statesmen gave no hint that he favored any early cessation of the war...Suzuki's selections for the most critical cabinet posts were, with one exception, not advocates of peace either.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the {{dreadnought}} design had {{not been}} fully validated, despite {{the success of the}} British namesake; for example, there were still concerns that the Minas Geraes class' superfiring turret arrangement—which {{had not been}} utilized on the original Dreadnought, but was also being installed on the American —would cause blast to hurt the crew in the lower turret. <b>Any</b> <b>immediate</b> concerns, however, were mitigated during the firing tests when no ill effects were observed, though the Times (London) reported that there were still concerns registered during São Paulos gun trials in June 1910.|$|E
5|$|From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk {{companion}} set {{out across}} the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented <b>any</b> <b>immediate</b> rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances.|$|E

5|$|On 5 August 1583, an English Sea Dog, Sir Humphrey Gilbert {{claimed the}} area as England's first {{overseas}} colony under Royal Charter of Queen Elizabeth I. There was no permanent population, however, and Gilbert was lost at sea during his return voyage, thereby ending <b>any</b> <b>immediate</b> plans for settlement. The Newfoundland National War Memorial is on the waterfront in St. John's, at the purported site of Gilbert's landing and proclamation.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Zoe {{severely}} impacted {{the islands}} of the Solomon island chain, particularly {{the islands of}} Tikopia and Anuta. In Anuta, agricultural activities were disrupted. Various fruit trees and crops, especially in gardens on the island's hills, were destroyed by high winds and heavy rain. In addition, communications with other islands were disrupted. The impact on Tikopia was much greater; agricultural productivity on the island {{was said to have}} been wiped out. Fruit trees were estimated only to begin producing fruit again at least two years after Zoe's impact. Topsoil was left dry by the cyclone, preventing <b>any</b> <b>immediate</b> replacement of lost crops.|$|E
5|$|Further east, the strongpoint {{defenses}} were effective. On the Dog Red / Easy Green boundary, {{the defenses}} around the Les Moulins strongpoint took a heavy {{toll on the}} remaining 2nd Battalion, with H/116 and headquarters elements struggling ashore there. The survivors joined the remnants of F/116 behind the shingle, and here the battalion commander was able to organize 50 men for an improvised advance across the shingle. A further advance up the bluffs just east of Les Moulins {{was too weak to}} have any effect and was forced back down. To their left, mainly between the draws on the Easy Green / Easy Red boundary, the 116th RCT's support battalion landed without too much loss, although they did become scattered, and were too disorganized to play <b>any</b> <b>immediate</b> part in an assault on the bluffs.|$|E
50|$|The Lateran Treaty of 1929 and the {{founding}} of the Vatican City State was not followed by <b>any</b> great <b>immediate</b> {{increase in the number of}} states with which the Holy See had official relations. This came later, especially after the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|Ndugu Mdogo Drop-In Centre, an {{initiative}} at the expansive Kibera slum, where Koinonia social workers initiate the rehabilitation process through activities targeting children {{living on the}} streets. The Drop-In centre also provides shelter for children in emergency situations such as sickness, abuse by adults or <b>any</b> other <b>immediate</b> danger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Deuced cold," [...] said Lord Dumbello, {{and then}} he {{adjusted}} his white cravat and touched up his whiskers. Having got so far, he did not proceed to <b>any</b> other <b>immediate</b> conversational efforts; nor did Griselda. But he grouped himself again as became a marquis, and gave very intense satisfaction to Mrs. Proudie.|$|R
5|$|In {{part due}} to his {{advanced}} years, Kenyatta rarely travelled outside of Eastern Africa. Under Kenyatta, Kenya was largely uninvolved {{in the affairs of}} other states, including those in the East African Community. Despite his reservations about <b>any</b> <b>immediate</b> East African Federation, in June 1967 Kenyatta signed the Treaty for East African Co-operation. In December he attended a meeting with Tanzanian and Ugandan representatives to form the East African Economic Community, reflecting Kenyatta's cautious approach toward regional integration. He also took on a mediating role during the Congo Crisis, heading the Organisation of African Unity's Conciliation Commission on the Congo.|$|E
5|$|Kim Deal's {{band the}} Breeders {{released}} Last Splash in August 1993; {{the album was}} very successful, and its release was followed by much touring. The Breeders then took an extended break from activity. One reason was that Deal's sister Kelley, who {{was also in the}} group, was arrested on drug charges in November 1994. Member Josephine Wiggs likewise took time away from the band, although Wiggs and Deal have different memories of the circumstances surrounding this. Wiggs recalls offering to be involved if Deal's next album {{was going to be a}} Breeders record, but having the impression that Deal wanted to do a solo release; Deal remembers Wiggs declining to be part of <b>any</b> <b>immediate</b> Breeders' recording, but offering to be on the one after that.|$|E
5|$|Transversal {{filters are}} not usually {{associated}} with passive implementations but the concept {{can be found in}} a Wiener and Lee patent from 1935 which describes a filter consisting of a cascade of all-pass sections. The outputs of the various sections are summed in the proportions needed to result in the required frequency function. This works by the principle that certain frequencies will be in, or close to antiphase, at different sections and will tend to cancel when added. These are the frequencies rejected by the filter and can produce filters with very sharp cut-offs. This approach did not find <b>any</b> <b>immediate</b> applications, and is not common in passive filters. However, the principle finds many applications as an active delay line implementation for wide band discrete-time filter applications such as television, radar and high-speed data transmission.|$|E

6000|$|... "By the Lord of heaven, if {{you come}} nearer I'll brain you!" [...] and, as the young man endeavoured to get within the sweep of the stick, he {{received}} a blow on the arm and elbow, which, for the moment, disabled him; and the pain was so sharp, as {{to prevent him from}} <b>any</b> further <b>immediate</b> attack.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then it can't {{have gained}} enough headway," [...] insisted the captain, [...] "to cause them <b>any</b> such <b>immediate</b> terror {{as would be}} {{indicated}} by the haste with which the whole ship's crew is tumbling into those boats; but as you say, sir, we'll have their story out {{of them in a}} few minutes now, so it's idle speculating beforehand." ...|$|R
5|$|Later in 1996, Deal {{changed the}} name of the group back to the Breeders, {{originally}} with almost the same line-up as the Amps. Until then, Deal had been waiting for Wiggs and Kelley to rejoin the Breeders and record a new album together, and had held back from reforming the Breeders out of respect for them. In May 1996, Wiggs revealed that she would not be involved in <b>any</b> <b>immediate</b> Breeders activity; Kelley also chose to stay in Saint Paul, to be close to her rehabilitation facility. Deal then decided that {{she did not want to}} wait any longer to reform the group, partly because the Breeders' repertoire was larger than the Amps', thereby allowing longer concerts. Deal added violinist Carrie Bradley (who had played on the Breeders' Pod album), and with Macpherson, Lerma, and Farley, played some shows in 1996 with Primus.|$|E
5|$|Preservation of the Mary Rose and her {{contents}} was {{an essential}} part of the project from the start. Though many artefacts, especially those that were buried in silt, had been preserved, the long exposure to an underwater environment had rendered most of them sensitive to exposure to air after recovery. Archaeologists and conservators had to work in tandem from the start to prevent deterioration of the artefacts. After recovery, finds were placed in so-called passive storage, which would prevent <b>any</b> <b>immediate</b> deterioration before the active conservation which would allow them to be stored in an open-air environment. Passive storage depended on the type of material that the object was made of, and could vary considerably. Smaller objects from the most common material, wood, were sealed in polyethylene bags to preserve moisture. Timbers and other objects that were too large to be wrapped were stored in unsealed water tanks. Growth of fungi and microbes that could degrade wood were controlled by various techniques, including low-temperature storage, chemicals, and in the case of large objects, common pond snails that consumed wood-degrading organisms but not the wood itself.|$|E
5|$|The High Court quickly {{assembled}} at Nikli. Guy de la Roche {{presented himself}} before it {{accompanied by his}} own knights, but the assembled barons decided {{that they did not}} have the authority to judge him, and referred the matter to King Louis IX of France (r. 1226–1270). Guy travelled to France in 1259, but Louis not only pardoned him, but awarded him the title of Duke, which he and his successors were to bear thereafter. The renegade Geoffroy de Bruyères too was brought for judgement before William, and it was only the determined and passionate intercession of the other barons that saved his life and secured a pardon from the vengeful prince. He was however deprived of the possession of his domains by the inalienable right of conquest, and retained them henceforth as a gift from the Prince, meaning that they would be forfeit upon his death unless he had <b>any</b> <b>immediate</b> descendants.|$|E
5000|$|Immediate Missions - those {{missions}} which suddenly arise and {{cannot be}} planned. They can be launched {{in support of}} <b>any</b> requesting unit. <b>Immediate</b> requests will be routed through the Direct Air Support Center and fulfilled based on the commander’s priorities.|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly, as in a last {{attempt to}} save Bathsheba from, at <b>any</b> rate, <b>immediate</b> anguish, he looked again, {{as he had}} looked before, at the chalk writing upon the coffin-lid. The scrawl was this simple one, [...] "FANNY ROBIN AND CHILD." [...] Gabriel took his {{handkerchief}} and carefully rubbed out the two latter words, leaving visible the inscription [...] "FANNY ROBIN" [...] only. He then left the room, and went out quietly by the front door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear uncle; my own one darling uncle, I {{want you}} only {{to do that}} which will make you--make you happy. What is Miss Dunstable to me {{compared}} to you?" [...] And then she stooped down and kissed him. The doctor was apparently too much astounded by the intimation given him to make <b>any</b> further <b>immediate</b> reply. His niece, seeing this, left him that she might go and dress; and when they met again in the drawing-room Frank Gresham was with them.|$|R
25|$|The Melbourne {{court hearing}} the action delayed <b>any</b> <b>immediate</b> {{decision}} on Kisch, leaving him in custody aboard the Strathaird as it departed the city.|$|E

25|$|The {{publication}} of Georgescu's magnum opus in 1971 did not trigger <b>any</b> <b>immediate</b> {{debates in the}} mainstream of the economics profession, and the only review in a leading mainstream journal warned the readers against the 'incorrect statements and philosophical generalisations' made by the author; but Georgescu did receive four favourable reviews from heterodox, evolutionary economists.|$|E
50|$|The prefix word {{comes in}} two formats, {{and the choice}} between them depends on the {{instruction}} which follows.If the instruction has any non-register operands, then the simple form is used, which provides 2 4-bit fields to extend <b>any</b> offset or <b>immediate</b> constant in the instruction stream to 20 bits.|$|R
6000|$|We {{have seen}} {{powerful}} evidences that {{the construction of}} [...] this globe and its associates; and, inferentially, that of [...] all the other globes in space, was the result, not of <b>any</b> [...] <b>immediate</b> or personal exertion {{on the part of}} the Deity, but [...] of natural laws which are the expression of His will. What [...] is to hinder our supposing that the organic creation is also [...] a result of natural laws which are in like manner an [...] expression of His will? (p. 154, 1st edition).|$|R
60|$|But Mrs. Rowan {{explained}} that she herself {{did not wish to}} come to <b>any</b> absolute or <b>immediate</b> rupture with Mrs. Tappitt. Of course their visit would be shortened, but Mrs. Tappitt was disposed to be very civil, as were the girls. Then Mrs. Rowan suggested whether there might not be a reconciliation between Luke and the brewery family.|$|R
25|$|Pre-hospital {{care for}} lung {{barotrauma}} includes basic life support of maintaining adequate oxygenation and perfusion, assessment of airway, breathing and circulation, neurological assessment, and managing <b>any</b> <b>immediate</b> life-threatening conditions. High-flow oxygen up to 100% is considered appropriate for diving accidents. Large-bore venous access with isotonic fluid infusion is recommended to maintain {{blood pressure and}} pulse.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, 1191, {{after the}} Battle of Arsuf, the Crusader army {{proceeded}} from Arsuf to Jaffa, which the Crusaders took and fortified. Jaffa, they hoped, {{would be the}} base of operations in a drive to reconquer Jerusalem itself. As the winter of 1191–1192 approached, sporadic negotiations between Richard the Lionheart and Saladin were taken up, though without <b>any</b> <b>immediate</b> result.|$|E
25|$|A half-hearted {{plan for}} {{international}} control was proposed at {{the newly formed}} United Nations by Bernard Baruch (The Baruch Plan), {{but it was clear}} both to American commentators—and to the Soviets—that it was an attempt primarily to stymie Soviet nuclear efforts. The Soviets vetoed the plan, effectively ending <b>any</b> <b>immediate</b> postwar negotiations on atomic energy, and made overtures towards banning the use of atomic weapons in general.|$|E

60|$|But Lucien's {{elevation}} did {{not necessarily}} improve the condition {{of his father and}} brother. The Dey cared only for those slaves who made themselves useful to him; their relations he utterly ignored, unless they succeeded in gaining his regard. The Sicilians had too much common-sense to expect <b>any</b> great <b>immediate</b> advantage from the change, nevertheless, the slight hope which had been aroused by this event enabled the two who were left in the Bagnio to endure their lot with greater fortitude and resignation. As for Lucien, he resolved to win the Dey's esteem {{in order to be able}} to influence him in favour of his father and brother.|$|R
40|$|Two {{cases of}} {{bilateral}} neonatal testicular torsion are reported and combined with 6 previously reported ones.
