5|$|As {{several other}} supernatural {{entities}} were also {{held responsible for}} bringing hail and torrential rains, when the entity is not explicitly named, it is often impossible to conclude to which the magical measures apply. There was, for example, a custom used when the approach of a thunderstorm was perceived: to bring <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> front of the house, and to put bread, salt, a knife with a black sheath, and an axe with its edge directed skywards on the table. By another custom, a fireplace trivet with its legs directed skywards, knives, forks, and the stub of the Slava candle were put on the table.|$|E
5|$|Being {{a part of}} Best's family meant Mona was accorded respect on Merseyside, which {{included}} meeting well-known sports personalities {{of the time and}} receiving preferential treatment when booking <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> a restaurant, or a seat in the theatre. The Bests lived for a short time at the Best family's large home in West Derby, which was called Ellerslie, but Mona fell out with John Best's sister, Edna, who resented her brother's choice of wife. The family then moved to a small flat on Cases Street, Liverpool (above Ma Edgerton's public house) but Mona was always looking for a large house—as she had been used to in India—instead of a smaller semi-detached house, which were prevalent in the area. After moving to a three-bedroom house in Princess Drive, Mona persuaded her parents, Thomas and Mary Shaw, to leave India and live with them in Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning on <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus {{seems to be}} on his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E

5|$|The film had regular showings in many theaters worldwide, {{with many}} as a monthly event. Fans {{interact}} with the film {{in a similar fashion}} to The Rocky Horror Picture Show; audience members dress up as their favorite characters, throw plastic spoons in reference to an unexplained framed photo of a spoon on <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> Johnny's living room, toss footballs to each other from short distances, and yell insulting comments {{about the quality of the}} film as well as lines from the film itself. Wiseau has claimed that it was his intent for audiences to find humor in the film, although viewers and some of the cast members generally have viewed it as a poorly-made drama.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} four quarterfinal matches in the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament opened Sacrifice. It pitted James Storm, {{accompanied}} by Jackie Moore and Sting, against Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). The match lasted eight minutes and fifty seconds. Near the end, Team 3D set up <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of the}} ring. Sting then turned on Storm and lifted him off the turnbuckle and slammed him through the table. Devon covered Storm for the win, thereby advancing himself and Brother Ray in the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, with Obama {{elected president}} and his junior staffers working in the White House, Obama encouraged the group to hold the Seder again. The 2009 event {{was the first time}} that a sitting U.S. president conducted a Passover Seder in the White House. The White House switchboard was reportedly swamped with callers seeking a dinner invitation. The White House Seder was scheduled for the second night of Passover to allow Jewish staffers to spend the first Seder on the first night of Passover with their families. About 20 guests sat around <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the Old Family Dining Room reading the Haggadah and sampling the traditional Seder foods. Malia and Sasha Obama, being the youngest in attendance, recited the Four Questions and engaged in the search for the afikoman.|$|E

5|$|Two other swords are used. The two-handed Sword of State, made in 1678, symbolises the monarch's royal authority. It is {{also carried}} before the monarch at State Openings of Parliament. Its wooden sheath is bound in crimson velvet {{decorated}} with silver-gilt emblems of England, Scotland and Ireland, fleurs-de-lis and portcullises. In the centre is the royal badge of joint-sovereigns WilliamIII and MaryII, for whose coronation the sheath {{was made in}} 1689. The lion of England and unicorn of Scotland form the cross-piece to the sword's handle. At coronations, a peer gives the Sword of State to the Lord Great Chamberlain who places it on <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> StEdward's Chapel.|$|E
5|$|News soon {{spread of}} {{thousands}} of Chinese joining forces with Javanese soldiers in Grobogan, outside of Semarang. On 1 May, Visscher was accosted by Captain Rudolph Carel von Glan, a unit leader, asking why Visscher had done nothing {{to deal with the}} uprising. Visscher heatedly replied that it was not Glan's business. The following day, after being questioned by prosecutor Jeronimus Tonnemans Jr., Yonko, and Anko, Visscher became increasingly angry, breaking <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> half and yelling at his Chinese advisers. When Yanko disappeared after the meeting, Anko told Visscher that he had joined the rebelling Chinese. This caused Visscher, who had heavily invested in Yonko and had left a large amount of money with him, to take out his carriage and scream to the residents of Semarang to escape while it was still possible. This continued until he crashed into the city walls. The residents ran away from Semarang in a panic, leaving eight loaded cannons outside the city walls.|$|E
