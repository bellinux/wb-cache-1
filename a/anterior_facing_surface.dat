40|$|The Netherlands SUMMARY Multilevel {{analysis}} {{is used to}} describe the changes in vertical facial dimensions and their relationships in Dutch girls between 7 and 14 years of age. For the <b>anterior</b> <b>face</b> height (nasion-gnathion) and the posterior face height (sella-gonion) a fourth degree polynomial was fitted. The mandibular plane angle (sella nasion-gonion gnathion) could be described with a second degree polynomial. Low correlations were found between the growth parameters (intercept and age coefficient) of the <b>anterior</b> and posterior <b>face</b> height, which points to independent growth and development of the <b>anterior</b> and posterior <b>face</b> height. The individual length and growth velocity (at age 10. 8) of the <b>anterior</b> <b>face</b> height and the mandibular plane angle showed substantial correlations. It was concluded that changes during growth with regard to the mandibular plane angle are more strongly related to the anterior than to the posterior face height...|$|R
40|$|Various {{comparative}} {{studies have been}} conducted to investigate the effect of functional and fixed appliances in treatment of class II skeletal disorders. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare Bionator and Edgewise appliances associated with class II elastics in the treatment of class II skeletal patients, without extraction. Lateral cephalograms of 30 patients (16 girls, 14 boys), 10 - 13 years old, with class II div I maolocclusion, treated with Bionater and Edgewise appliances were investigated before and after treatment. SNA, SNB, ANB, " to SN, IMP A, mandibular and maxillary lengths, upper anterior facial height to lower anterior facial height, overjet and overbite were measured in each group before and after treatment. The results were analyzed by paired t- test. The magnification of linear measurements were calculated. The differences between variables in 2 groups were compared by t-test. There was no significant difference, regarding age and sex. In both groups, increase in SNB, mandibular length, and IMPA and decrease in " to SN, overjet and overbite and upper <b>anterior</b> <b>face</b> height to lower <b>anterior</b> <b>face</b> height after treatment were statistically significant. Comparing 2 groups before and after treatment showed that increase in SNB and decrease of ANB, overjet and overbite were more in Bionator group than fixed group, which were significant.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{patterns}} of facial growth development in subjects with skeletal open-bite and skeletal deep-bite faces. Longitudinal data based on lateral cephalometric radiographs of 16 male and 16 female subjects, ages 3 through 18 years, were used. These subjects were selected on the basis of lower face height as a percentage of total face height. Persons exhibiting extreme values were selected to create four groups with eight subjects in each group. Curves of absolute and incremental growth for total <b>anterior</b> <b>face</b> height, upper <b>anterior</b> <b>face</b> height, lower <b>anterior</b> <b>face</b> height, posterior face height, and ramal length were analyzed statistically and graphically. It was established that the anterior dimensions of the face demonstrated typologically divergent patterns of development in open- and deep-bite faces. Further, the posterior dimensions of the face did not discriminate between these two typological groups. The female open-bite subjects were earliest in the timing of the adolescent growth spurt, followed in succession by deep-bite female subjects, open-bite male subjects, and finally the deep-bite male subjects. The clinical implications of these observations pertain to the timing of orthodontic treatment, the length of retention period, and the prediction of adult occlusal status during the mixed dentition...|$|R

40|$|A {{section of}} the {{retrieved}} Hubble Space Telescope (HST) solar array drive arm (SADA) multilayer insulation (MLI), which experienced 8. 25 years of space exposure, was analyzed for environmental durability of {{the top layer of}} silver-Teflon (DuPont) fluorinated ethylene propylene (Ag-FEP). Because the SADA MLI had solar and anti-solar <b>facing</b> <b>surfaces</b> and was exposed to the space environment for a long duration, it provided a unique opportunity to study solar effects on the environmental degradation of Ag-FEP, a commonly used spacecraft thermal control material. Data obtained included tensile properties, solar absorptance, surface morphology and chemistry. The solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> was found to be extremely embrittled and contained numerous through-thickness cracks. Tensile testing indicated that the solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> lost 60 % of its mechanical strength and 90 % of its elasticity while the anti-solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> had ductility similar to pristine FEP. The solar absorptance of both the solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> (0. 155 plus or minus 0. 032) and the anti-solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> (0. 208 plus or minus 0. 012) were found to be greater than pristine Ag-FEP (0. 074). Solar facing and anti-solar <b>facing</b> <b>surfaces</b> were microscopically textured, and locations of isolated contamination were present on the anti-solar surface resulting in increased localized texturing. Yet, the overall texture was significantly more pronounced on the solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> indicating a synergistic effect of combined solar exposure and increased heating with atomic oxygen erosion. The results indicate a very strong dependence of degradation, particularly embrittlement, upon solar exposure with orbital thermal cycling having a significant effect...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} distinctive dentofacial characteristics of hypodontia patients. For this purpose, 189 young hypodontia patients (cases) {{were divided into}} subgroups, based on criteria from literature. Normalised differences between cases and controls were calculated for various parameters of dentofacial form. Subsequently, cluster analysis was applied to disclose subsets of hypodontia patients with distinctive dentofacial features. The ANB angle, interincisal angle and lower <b>anterior</b> <b>face</b> height were consistently significantly different amongst the subsets. Four clusters of patients with {{an increasing number of}} missing teeth and distinctive dentofacial characteristics could be identified. Patients in cluster 1 display a high-angle facial pattern. Patients in clusters 2 and 3 exhibit markable dentoalveolar characteristics (a relatively small and a large interincisal angle, respectively). Patients in cluster 4 exhibited notable sagittal-skeletal discriminative features predominantly because of a retrognathic maxilla. The smallest nasolabial angle and lower <b>anterior</b> <b>face</b> height were seen in this cluster. It is concluded that the anterior-posterior relationship between the jaws, the interincisal angle and the lower <b>anterior</b> <b>face</b> height are discriminative parameters of dentofacial form in hypodontia patients.
