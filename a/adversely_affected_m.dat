40|$|BACKGROUND: Between 1979 and 1989, 48 {{cases of}} {{extradural}} spinal cord and cauda equina compression {{in patients with}} lymphoma (24) and myeloma (24) received local radiation therapy for control of cord compression. Twenty five (52 %) of the cases were treated by surgical decompression prior to irradiation. Thirty five (73 %) of the cases received chemotherapy following the diagnosis of spinal cord compression. Post-treatment outcome was assessed at a minimum follow-up of 24 months to determine the significant clinical and treatment factors following irradiation. RESULTS: Seventeen (71 %) of the lymphoma and 15 (63 %) of the myeloma patients achieved local control, here defined as improvement to, or maintenance of ambulation with minimal or no assistance for 3 months {{from the start of}} radiotherapy. At a median follow-up of 30 (2 - 98) for the lymphoma and 10 (1 - 87) months for the myeloma patients, the results showed that survival following local radiation therapy for cord compression was independently influenced by the underlying disease type in favour of lymphoma compared to myeloma (P < 0. 01). The median duration of local control and survival figures were 23 and 48 months for the lymphomas compared to 4. 5 and 10 months for the myeloma cases. Survival was also independently influenced by preservation of sphincter function at initial presentation (P < 0. 02) and the achievement of local control following treatment (P < 0. 01). DISCUSSION: We conclude that while disease type independently impacts on outcome following treatment of spinal cord compression in lymphoma and myeloma, within both of these disease types the achievement of local control of spinal cord compression is an important management priority, for without local control survival may be <b>adversely</b> <b>affected.</b> <b>M.</b> Wallington, S.

The three navigation systems compared were: {{very high frequency}} omnidirectional range/distance measuring equipment (VOR/DME) and ILS, VOR/DME and + or - 40 MLS, and VOR/DME and + or - 60 MLS. Other factors studied were M & S tentative schedule point location, route geometry effects, and approach gate location effects. Summarized results are: the MLS offers some improvement over VOR/DME and ILS if all approach routes contain computer assisted turns; pilot reaction to moving the gate closer to the runway threshold may <b>adversely</b> <b>affect</b> <b>M</b> & S performance; and coupling en route metering to terminal scheduling transfers most of the terminal holding to more full efficient, higher altitude en route delay...|$|R
40|$|The report {{identifies}} numerous {{failures in}} DIMIA processes that <b>adversely</b> <b>affected</b> <b>Ms</b> Alvarez. These include the failure by DIMIA officers to properly identify Ms Alvarez, {{the decision to}} detain her under the Migration Act, the subsequent decision to remove her from Australia, the level of health care provided to her while in detention, and DIMIA 2 ̆ 7 s response to concerns raised by her former husband as to her whereabouts. Recommendations made in the report reinforce {{a number of the}} recommendations made by Mr Mick Palmer AO APM in his inquiry into the circumstances of the immigration detention of Cornelia Rau. The report also identifies failures by several individual DIMIA officers who, on becoming aware in 2003 and 2004 that an Australian citizen had been wrongfully removed from the country, took no further action on the matter. The report recommends that the Secretary of DIMIA consider whether some officers may have breached the Australian Public Service Code of Conduct. Released 6 October 200...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} a high-intensity strength training session on rowing sprint performance. Ten male club rowers performed a baseline counter-movement jump (CMJ) and a 250 m rowing ergometer sprint (250 m). Twenty-four hours after baseline, participants performed a high-intensity strength training session (ST) consisting of multi-joint barbell exercises. At 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post-ST, CMJ and 250 m were repeated alongside assessment of plasma creatine kinase (CK) and perceived muscle soreness. At 24 h post-ST 250 m performance decreased significantly (90 % CI: 0. 3 - 0. 7 s), but returned to pre-test values at 48 h. There was a significant decrease in CMJ height at 48 h post ST (90 % CI: - 0. 7 - - 4. 1 cm). Perceived muscle soreness was significantly greater than baseline at all assessed time points following ST (p < 0. 05). There was a significant increase in CK from baseline to 24 h (90 % CI: 146 - 390 U/L). High-intensity strength training was observed to <b>adversely</b> <b>affect</b> 250 <b>m</b> rowing ergometer performance after 24 h and coincided with transient muscle damage...|$|R
