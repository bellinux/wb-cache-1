5|$|In {{the first}} epoch (1907–19), Noether dealt {{primarily}} with differential and algebraic invariants, beginning with her dissertation under Paul Gordan. Her mathematical horizons broadened, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> became more general and abstract, as she became {{acquainted with the}} work of David Hilbert, through close interactions with a successor to Gordan, Ernst Sigismund Fischer. After moving to Göttingen in 1915, she produced her seminal work for physics, the two Noether's theorems.|$|E

The author <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> inspired museum exhibits and Genji manga spin-offs. The design on the reverse of the first 2000 yen note commemorated her and The Tale of Genji. A plant bearing purple berries has been named after her.|$|E

5|$|In the Middle Ages, Proba <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> were praised as {{examples}} of scholarship. Petrarch implicitly referenced De laudibus Christi in a letter discussing female geniuses, and in 1374 Giovanni Boccaccio included Proba in his biographical collection of historical and mythological women entitled De mulieribus claris. In 1474, the poem was published by the Swiss printer Michael Wenssler, which likely made Proba the first female author to have had her work reproduced by a printing press. During the Renaissance, Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi was printed many times (for instance, Italian scholar Filippo Ermini lists seven incunabula and fourteen 16th-century editions of the poem), and Proba's poem was openly admired by thinkers like John Colet and Maffeo Vegio.|$|E
5|$|Joanna is then {{ordered to}} snoop around and {{investigate}} the crash site. In the process, she is captured {{and taken to}} the Pelagic I ship, along with the alien wreckage. Nevertheless, a mysterious alien rescues her and convinces her to sink the Pelagic I with the wreckage and escape. She succeeds and when she contacts Carrington, she tells him that she discovered that the wreckage belonged to an alien race called the Skedar. The situation changes abruptly when the Carrington Institute is stormed by a dataDyne strike team who hopes to destroy any clues of the conspiracy. Joanna manages to defend the Institute <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> earned her enough recognition {{to take part in}} her next mission. The game ends with the Carrington Institute carrying out further investigations of dataDyne, setting the stage for the Nintendo 64 game.|$|E
5|$|Maria {{competed in}} the Diva Search in 2004, {{deciding}} to enter the contest after seeing an advertisement while watching Raw. Even though she only placed fifth in the contest, she {{was hired by the}} company. She stood out in the contest by giving fellow contestant Carmella DeCesare the finger after being eliminated from the contest. Maria began making appearances in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), WWE's then-developmental territory. She contributed booking ideas, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> at OVW earned her a spot on the Raw brand roster. Maria was brought on to Raw as a ditzy backstage interviewer and the host of WWE KissCam in November 2004. Her gimmick involved her asking wrong questions, irritating and amusing the roster.|$|E

5|$|Ruth {{is portrayed}} as being strong-willed, {{determined}} and loyal. She is also a New Woman and a farmer, traits that made her {{stand out from the}} other female characters in The Archers {{at the time of her}} introduction. In later years, Ruth has mellowed and is more open to negotiation. Her storylines have often revolved around her marriage to David <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> on Brookfield Farm. In the early 2000s, the scriptwriters had Ruth and David isolate themselves from the community during a foot-and-mouth outbreak. Ruth was also diagnosed with breast cancer, a storyline which Finch undertook extensive research for and later named as one of her Archers highlights.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Household Management {{has been}} edited, revised and {{enlarged}} several times since Isabella's death {{and is still}} in print as at 2016. Food writers have stated that the subsequent editions of the work were far removed from and inferior to the original version. Several cookery writers, including Elizabeth David and Clarissa Dickson Wright, have criticised Isabella's work, particularly her use of other people's recipes. Others, such as the food writer Bee Wilson, consider the censure overstated, and that Beeton <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> should be thought extraordinary and admirable. Her name has become associated with knowledge and authority on Victorian cooking and home management, and the Oxford English Dictionary states that by 1891 the term Mrs Beeton had become used as a generic name for a domestic authority. She is also considered a strong influence in the building or shaping of a middle-class identity of the Victorian era.|$|E
5|$|Twenty years later, Jane, now a {{successful}} author and by choice unmarried, sees Tom during a gathering. Henry, now married to Eliza, brings Tom to her. Tom introduces his eldest daughter, who admires Jane's novels.

Astonished that he named his eldest after her, Jane agrees to read. The last scene shows Tom's daughter sitting by Jane as she reads aloud from Pride and Prejudice, while Tom watches Jane affectionately.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 50 - 52). Within the past several years, there has been a resurgence of interest in Jane Austen's life <b>and</b> <b>works.</b> She <b>and</b> <b>her</b> novels have become a part of popular culture through films, written adaptations, and Austen-related commodities. This thesis is an evaluation of the mechanisms (specifically a Jane Austen clock, a Jane Austen pendant, a Regency figure trinket box, the film Clueless, and the novels Bridget Jones's Diary and Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason) through which interest in Jane Austen has permeated popular culture {{and the ways in which}} she <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>works</b> have been translated into other media. The project's main focus is not what these films, written adaptations, and objects tell us about Jane Austen, but what they reflect about modern-day commodity culture, about current notions of class and culture (especially "high" culture versus popular/"low" culture), and about how Jane Austen functions as an idea within modern-day notions of culture. Most people seem to understand culture to be divided into high culture and popular/low culture. An evaluation of Jane Austen reveals that she <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>works</b> can considered to be representative of high culture. Because she <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>works</b> can be seen as symbols of high culture, the market for popular culture items related to <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>works</b> is created, at least in part, by people's desire to be attached to <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> to the high culture she represents. Jane Austen's existence in popular culture through these objects, films, and texts provides easier access to <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>works</b> <b>and,</b> subsequently, to society's perception of high culture...|$|R
