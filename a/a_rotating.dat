5|$|Many players {{prefer to}} play the Hammond through <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> speaker cabinet known, after several name changes, as a Leslie speaker, after its {{inventor}} Donald J. Leslie. The Leslie system is an integrated speaker/amplifier combination in which sound is emitted by <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> horn over a stationary treble compression driver, and <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> baffle beneath a stationary bass woofer. This creates a characteristic sound because of the constantly changing pitch shifts that result from the Doppler effect created by the moving sound sources.|$|E

5|$|In 1850 and in 1862, Léon Foucault made {{improved}} determinations of {{the speed}} of light substituting <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> mirror for Fizeau's toothed wheel. (Figure2) The apparatus involves light from slit S reflecting off <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> mirror R, forming an image of the slit on the distant stationary mirror M, which is then reflected back to reform an image of the original slit. If mirror R is stationary, then the slit image will reform at S regardless of the mirror's tilt. The situation is different, however, if R is in rapid rotation.|$|E

5|$|However, {{because the}} planet is {{rotating}} underneath the atmosphere, and frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it, the air flow from center to periphery is not direct, but is twisted due to the Coriolis effect, or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> frame of reference.

5|$|Stars are {{believed}} to form {{as the result of}} a collapse of a low-temperature cloud of gas and dust. As the cloud collapses, conservation of angular momentum causes any small net rotation of the cloud to increase, forcing the material into <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> disk. At the dense center of this disk a protostar forms, which gains heat from the gravitational energy of the collapse.|$|E
5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are trained}} to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a supercell. They typically look to its rear, the main region of updraft and inflow. Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of tornadogenesis is the formation of <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> wall cloud. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell.|$|E

5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> mirror.

5|$|A Leslie speaker {{consists}} {{of a number of}} individual components. The audio signal enters the amplifier from the instrument. Once amplified, the signal travels to an audio crossover, which splits it into separate frequency bands that can be individually routed to each loudspeaker. Different models have different combinations of speakers, but the most common model, the 122, {{consists of}} a single woofer for bass and a single compression driver and acoustic horn for treble. The audio emitted by the speakers is isolated inside an enclosure, aside from a number of outlets that lead towards either <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> horn or drum. An electric motor rotates both horn and drum at a constant speed.|$|E
