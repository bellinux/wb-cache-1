5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>assassination</b> of the King at the Stockholm {{opera in}} 1792, {{support for the}} liberal arts was withdrawn. Bellman, already in poor health from alcoholism, went into decline, {{drinking}} increasingly heavily. His drinking very likely contributed to his gout, which troubled him badly in 1790. He also caught tuberculosis: the disease had already killed his mother, and by the winter of 1792, he was seriously ill.|$|E

Tiberius' father, who had been imprisoned by Caligula, was released on Claudius' orders, and his younger brother Marcus became first husband to Agrippa's daughter Berenice.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the film}} was written and {{production}} photography completed in late 1967, it was released <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>assassinations</b> of Martin Luther King and Robert F.

50|$|Nevertheless, having decided upon {{war with}} German support, Austria {{was slow to}} act publicly, and did not deliver the {{ultimatum}} until July 23, some three weeks <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>assassinations</b> on 28 June. Thus Austria lost the reflex sympathies attendant to the Sarajevo murders and gave the further impression to the Entente powers that Austria was merely using <b>the</b> <b>assassinations</b> as a pretext for aggression.|$|R

She then killed the kneeling former warlord by shooting him three times with her Browning pistol. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>assassination,</b> she stayed at the crime scene to explain her deed and distribute mimeographed pamphlets to bystanders. Her case drew a significant amount of public and media attention.|$|E
