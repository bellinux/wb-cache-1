5|$|Lee {{received}} Magruder's {{calls for}} reinforcement and instructed Huger to let Ransom go support the men trapped {{on the field}} of battle. He also sent orders to the brigades of Brig. Gens. Joseph B. Kershaw and Paul Jones Semmes, in Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws's division within Magruder's command. Robert Ransom's unit, after they finally showed up with Huger's permission, first attempted to charge straight up the hill, following the path of other Confederate brigades attempting to aid Magruder. When this proved useless, Ransom ordered them to regroup in the woods to the Confederate right, march double-time a half a mile in a hook to the right <b>around</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other Confederate units and attack the far Union western flank. While Ransom was angling west, Jackson responded to a request for reinforcement from D. H. Hill by sending forward brigades from his own command to move from the east into the area where D. H. Hill had attacked. From his own division Jackson sent Brig. Gens. Alexander Lawton and Charles S. Winder, and from Ewell's division, Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble and Cols. Leroy A. Stafford and Jubal Early.|$|E
5|$|The Army {{also raised}} many {{anti-aircraft}} and coastal defence units during the war. The pre-war coastal defences were greatly expanded from 1939, and many new batteries were built near major ports in Australia and New Guinea {{in response to}} the threat of Japanese attack. Australia had a limited capacity to produce anti-aircraft guns, and the bulk of equipment had to come from Britain. As such the development of such defences was initially hampered by a lack of available equipment. The coastal defence system reached its peak size during 1944. The Army had few anti-aircraft guns at the outbreak of war, and a high priority was given to expanding the air defences around major cities and important industrial and military facilities. By 1942 anti-aircraft batteries were in place <b>around</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> major cities as well as the key towns in northern Australia. The expansion of the artillery in general, and coastal defence and anti-aircraft units in particular, meant that by June 1942 some 80,000 of the 406,000 members of the Army were artillerymen. VDC units gradually took over responsibility for manning the fixed coastal and anti-aircraft defences as the threat of attack against the Australian mainland receded.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the vast stores of {{information}} made accessible on the web, one hundred critics pointed to a decrease in the desire to recall certain types of information, indicating, they believed, a change in the process of recalling information, as well as the types of information that are recalled. According to Ben Worthen, a Wall Street Journal business technology blogger, the growing importance placed on the ability to access information instead of the capacity to recall information straight from memory would, in the long term, change the type of job skills that companies who are hiring new employees would find valuable. Due to an increased reliance on the Internet, Worthen speculated that before long [...] "the guy who remembers every fact about a topic may not be as valuable as the guy who knows how to find all of these facts and many others". Evan Ratliff of Salon.com wondered if the usage of gadgets to recall phone numbers, as well as geographical and historical information, had the effect of releasing certain cognitive resources that in turn strengthened other aspects of cognition. Drawing parallels with transactive memory — a process whereby people remember things in relationships and groups — Ratliff mused that perhaps the web was [...] "like a spouse who is <b>around</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time, with a particular knack for factual memory of all varieties". Far from conclusive, these ruminations left the web's impact on memory retention an open question.|$|E
500|$|The speech Big Gay Al gave {{while taking}} Stan {{on a boat}} ride through his animal {{sanctuary}} were based on actual speeches animation director Eric Stough made {{while working as a}} [...] "jungle cruise director" [...] at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The dirt smudges on the football player's helmets and uniforms were intentionally designed to look like smudges on construction paper. This was done to maintain the show's deliberately crude visual style they first created with construction paper in [...] "The Spirit of Christmas" [...] and the pilot episode, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe". The characters Butters Stotch and Clyde Donovan are featured during the football game, although neither had been identified by name yet in the series. During a football crowd scene, a white character can be seen that looks identical to Token Black, an African-American character introduced later in the series. The background character is wearing the same shirt Token wears, which Parker explained was the result of an animator placing a different head on the body {{in order to create a}} filler character for the crowd. The moment when Big Gay Al says, [...] "My work here is done" [...] and disappears into a suitcase is Stone's favorite part of the episode, even though he admitted, [...] "It makes no sense". Parker said that the moment was written that way simply because the duo could not decide how to [...] "get rid of" [...] the character. Parker said, [...] "We didn't want him <b>around</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time, (so we asked) how do we not make him a character each week".|$|E

2500|$|The character's first return storyline {{concentrated}} on her attempt to seduce and then blackmail wealthy resident Ian Beale (played by Adam Woodyatt). [...] "Clare's a chancer," [...] explains Bissix, [...] "She sees Ian as a route to easy money!" [...] The Sun newspaper reported that [...] "Ian is mesmerised" [...] by Clare's attempts to lure {{him away from}} his wife Jane (Laurie Brett). Commenting on the storyline, Bissix said [...] "Clare knows Ian is married! But that makes it more of a challenge." [...] Eventually Clare's true motive was unearthed. After Ian nearly relented to her attempts at seduction, she proceeded to blackmail him. An EastEnders insider said: [...] "Ian has been completely blown away by Clare ever since {{she returned to the}} Square. She is a saucy little minx and will stop at nothing to get him into bed. But she’s not really interested in him – she just wants his money. So Ian is really playing with fire and risking his marriage just by being alone with Clare. But he’s more of a silly old fool than anything – although I’m not sure that Jane will see it like that, especially if she finds out about their kiss. And Clare being Clare, she probably will – unless of course Ian pays her to keep quiet." [...] However, in the storyline, Clare's games were eventually halted when Ian confessed to Jane and she ordered Clare to [...] "Stay away from Ian!". According to Bissix, filming these scenes was particularly hard for Adam Woodyatt, who knew her well when she was only a child from her first stint in the soap: [...] "Poor Adam. He spent a day staring at my chest for one scene, trying to get the fact that the last time he saw me I was 14 out of his head. He was a friend of Nigel so he was <b>around</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time when I was first here and we'd done scenes together. Now, instead of this snotty-nosed little girl making Nigel's tea, she was trying to seduce him and get him in his Y-fronts." ...|$|E
