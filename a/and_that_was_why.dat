5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was challenged}} by David Carpenter two years later, in 1985. Montfort {{had no intention}} to compromise with the royalists at all, according to Carpenter. In Carpenter's version of events, the Mise of Lewes was written while the battle was still ongoing, not after the battle was over, as previously assumed. This put Montfort {{in a situation where}} concessions were necessary, in order to bring hostilities to a halt as soon as possible. Once the battle was over and government in Montfort's hands, he had no longer any interest in reaching a compromise with the royalists, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> hostilities continued. This dating of the document, however, has later been disputed by D. W. Burton, who maintains that the document was in fact signed after the battle was concluded.|$|E

25|$|After being {{visited by}} the three men, Abraham and Sarah settled between Kadesh and Shur {{in the land of}} the Philistines. While he was living in Gerar, Abraham again claimed that Sarah was his sister. King Abimelech {{subsequently}} had her brought to him. Later, God came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a married woman. Abimelech, who had not laid hands on her, inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation, especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> he continued to exist. However, if he did not return Sarah to Abraham, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him.|$|E

25|$|As of 17 December 2015, 27 Financial Notices to Improve {{have been}} served upon Multi Academy Trusts, only 16 {{of which were}} still open as 11 of the organisations {{initially}} queried had improved and had their Notice to Improve removed. In its 2014 Annual Report, AET stated that the trust expected the EFA Notice to Improve to be lifted by March 2015. However the Financial Warning Notice remained in place in Autumn 2015. In the September 2015 AET Board meeting, the CEO Ian Comfort was cited explaining the situation by {{saying that he had}} not even been aware of the crucial deadline for reporting to the Education Funding Agency, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> the paperwork was not submitted that would have enabled the Financial Notice to Improve, to be lifted. Be that as it may, the Notice to Improve, was still in place requiring AET to improve, a full year later at the end of August 2016.|$|E
500|$|On November 1, 2007, the South Carolina Democratic Party {{executive}} council voted 13–3 to refuse Colbert's application onto the ballot. [...] "The {{general sense of}} the council was that he wasn't a serious candidate <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> he wasn't selected {{to be on the}} ballot", stated John Werner, the party's director. In addition, he was declared [...] "not viable", as he was running in only one state. Several days later he announced that he was dropping out of the race, saying that he did not wish to put the country through an agonizing Supreme Court battle. CNN has reported that Obama supporters pressured the South Carolina Democratic Executive Council to keep Colbert off the ballot.

[...] Salo said that his hands were bruised during the race as his car had no power steering equipped. Michael Schumacher admitted to feeling disappointed after the race, having led the majority of the race until his lap 56 retirement. He stated: [...] "The exhaust was too hot <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> the rest went wrong. It basically cooked the suspension.

We were always under the impression that we should feel honoured to be in the employ of the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company; it was patently obvious that the management held firmly to the policy that nobody is indispensable". [...] Morey noted that Evans had played several roles with the company and commented, [...] "In 1927 she was apparently demoted to the chorus, and there she remained for [...] ... I should not have thought these qualifications sufficient for such an important post; to spend all those years as a chorister seems to signify a lack of ambition or achievement. [...] But I suppose a 'Director of Productions' in those days merely needed to know every move and every gesture, and exactly when they occurred, for no departure from the set production was ever permitted." [...] Richard Walker, Kenneth Sandford and others also criticised Evans's temperament and methods.
