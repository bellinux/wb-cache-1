500|$|On September 29, 2009, Randazza {{requested}} that Beck voluntarily {{ask that the}} First Amendment {{be applied to the}} arbitration case, despite its international setting. Randazza made this request because Beck's political commentary favored the United States Constitution over international law. Randazza's September 29, 2009 letter to Beck's attorneys cited statements by Beck in which he indicated he preferred United States law over international law. Beck had said, [...] "Once we sign our rights over to international law, the Constitution is officially dead." [...] Randazza's letter concluded: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> neither party wishes to see First Amendment rights subordinated to international trademark principles, thus unwittingly proving Mr. Beck's point.

500|$|Newly elected President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych {{wanted to}} oust the current Cabinet and form a new Cabinet with his Party of Regions after his {{election}} on February 7, 2010. On February 20, 2010 Parliament Speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn stated he would announce {{the dissolution of the}} coalition the next plenary week if its activity by then was not confirmed in documents. On February 17 Lytvyn had asked the coalition to provide within ten days documents that confirmed its existence, in particular, a list of at least 226 Members of Parliament who are members. Lytvyn stated {{that it was possible to}} ensure [...] "the effectiveness of the current coalition" [...] or create a new coalition in parliament. Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko stated on February 22 she was holding negotiation [...] "to unite in the Verkhovna Rada the democratic and pro-Ukrainian forces, all rational deputies of Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc, the Lytvyn Bloc and Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc". If the current Cabinet could not be preserved Tymoshenko has stated she would go into Parliamentary opposition. During a Cabinet of Ministers meeting on February 24, 2010 Tymoshenko stated “I <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> Our Ukraine group leaders … will stand firmly in the defense of Ukraine and everything Ukrainian. I <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> these leaders will not change their ideology or beliefs and join a majority coalition led by Party of Regions” (the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc or Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc faction where needed to form a new coalition). On February 24 Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine’s parliament) Volodymyr Lytvyn received a document that had been drafted by the Party of Regions faction that had been submitted for examination by all factions, except the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc, according to the Party of Regions the document was not the draft of a new coalition agreement but [...] "a document submitted to the head of the Lytvyn Bloc faction in the process of talks so that he can consider this draft and we proposed that our colleagues consider this coalition agreement and make their amendments and remarks, if they deem it necessary".|$|E

Morgan should be {{credited}} {{for work on}} the half dollar and quarter eagle is uncertain; Mint officials and employees were not consistent on this point. [...] Assistant Director Mary M. O'Reilly said in 1936 that the bureau's records indicated that Barber was the designer. [...] Later the same year, she forwarded a statement by an unnamed Philadelphia Mint employee stating that by {{the very nature of}} Barber's and Morgan's long association (Morgan was Barber's assistant for 37 years), the two engravers would have conferred frequently, and that Morgan's technique is [...] "very obvious on both sides of both coins". The employee concluded that [...] "no mistake could be made, in my opinion, in crediting both men with the execution of these two coins. [...] I <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> this is correct." [...] Q. David Bowers, in his book on commemoratives, mentions the dispute, credits Barber on the obverses of both coins, and gives both men credit on the reverse of the half dollar. He asserts Morgan created the reverse of the quarter eagle.|$|E

Mussolini wrote to Bergonzoli: [...] "I have given you a difficult task but one suited to your courage and experience as an old and intrepid soldier—the task of defending the fortress of Bardia to the last. I <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> 'Electric Beard' and his brave soldiers will stand at whatever cost, faithful to the last." [...] Bergonzoli replied: [...] "I am aware of the honour and I have today repeated to my troops your message — simple and unequivocal. In Bardia we are and here we stay." [...] Bergonzoli had approximately 45,000 defenders under his command. The Italian divisions defending the perimeter of Bardia included remnants of four divisions. The northern ("Gerfah") sector was held by the 2nd [...] "28 October" [...] Blackshirt Division; the centre ("Ponticelli") sector by the 1st [...] "23 March" [...] Blackshirt Division and elements of the 62nd [...] "Marmarica" [...] Infantry Division; and the southern ("Mereiga") sector by the 63rd [...] "Cirene" [...] Infantry Division {{and the rest of}} the 62nd [...] "Marmarica" [...] Infantry Division. [...] Bergonzoli also had the remnants of the disbanded 64th [...] "Catanzaro" [...] Infantry Division, some 6,000 Frontier Guard (GaF) troops, three companies of Bersaglieri, part of the dismounted Vittorio Emanuele cavalry regiment, and a machine gun company of the 60th [...] "Sabratha" [...] Infantry Division.|$|E
500|$|The British premiere at the 1988 Edinburgh Festival brought {{critical}} praise: [...] "Through its sheer cleverness, wit, lyrical {{beauty and}} sense of theater, it sweeps aside most of the criticism to which it lays itself open." [...] When the work was finally performed in London, 13 years after its Houston premiere and after {{a long period of}} theatrical neglect, Tempos critic Robert Stein responded to ENO's 2000 production enthusiastically. He particularly praised the performance of Maddalena, and concluded that [...] "Adams's triumph... consists really in taking a plot chock-full of talk and public gesture, and through musical characterisation... making a satisfying and engaging piece." [...] Of the ENO revival in 2006, Erica Jeal of The Guardian wrote that [...] "from its early visual coup {{with the arrival of the}} plane, Sellars' production is an all-too-welcome reminder of his best form". In Jeal's view, the cast met admirably the challenge of presenting the work in a non-satirical spirit. Reviewing the 2008 Portland Opera production (the basis of the 2011 Canadian Opera Company presentation in Toronto), critic Patrick J. Smith concluded that [...] "Nixon in China is a great American Opera. I suspected that it was a significant work when I saw it in 1987; I was ever more convinced of its stature when I heard it subsequently, on stage and on disc, and today I <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> it is one of the small handful of operas that will survive." ...|$|E

[...] "Mixed in with the hysterics were some logic, though: homosexuals faced condemnation and discrimination, and most of them—wishing to conceal their orientation—were vulnerable to blackmail." [...] DCI Roscoe Hillenkoetter was called to Congress to testify on homosexuals being employed at the CIA. He said, [...] "The use of homosexuals as a control mechanism over individuals recruited for espionage is a generally accepted technique which has been used at least on a limited basis for many years." [...] As soon as the DCI said these words, his aide signaled to take {{the remainder of the}} DCI's testimony off the record. Political historian David Barrett uncovered Hillenkoetter's notes, which reveal the remainder of the statement: [...] "While this agency will never employ homosexuals on its rolls, it might conceivably be necessary, and in the past has actually been valuable, to use known homosexuals as agents in the field. I <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> if Josef Stalin or a member of the Politburo or a high satellite official were known to be a homosexual, no member of this committee or of the Congress would balk against our use of any technique to penetrate their operations... after all, intelligence and espionage is, at best, an extremely dirty business."

Quite simply, Dr. Siebert is a well-qualified doctor doing his best to serve the people of this district.

[...] Since there were female terrorists as well, according to Montgomery, all fraternising with the local population would have to cease. Within a few minutes of the bombing, Barker translated this instruction into an order that [...] "all Jewish places of entertainment, cafes, restaurants, shops and private dwellings" [...] be out of bounds to all ranks. He concluded, [...] "I appreciate that these measures will inflict some hardship on the troops, but I <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> if my reasons are fully explained to them, they will understand their propriety and they will be punishing the Jews in a way the race dislikes as much as any, by striking at their pockets and showing our contempt of them."

[...] The [...] officer called a halt, none of them would follow me. [...] I was informed that Leroux, the principle guide, told the officer in command, to halt, that the Indians wanted to have a parley. The Jicarillas started packing their goods for flight and a shot was fired that struck Captain Grier, causing no serious injury. (Due to the fact that Grier had a pair of heavy gauntlets tucked in his jacket) The captain ordered a charge, but the delay allowed all but one of the Indians to escape. In about 200 yards, pursuing the Indians, the body of Mrs. White was found, perfectly warm, had not been killed more than five minutes - shot through the heart by an arrow.... I <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> if the Indians had been charged immediately on our arrival she would have been saved." [...] Ann White's daughter and servant were never found.|$|E
2500|$|Warner Bros. {{had trouble}} distributing the film. In an {{interview}} for Look magazine, producer Leon Schlesinger complained that Clean Pastures gave him more trouble with Hollywood censors than any live-action film. Censor Joseph I. Breen alleged that the cartoon violated the Hays Production Code, {{a set of rules}} for the content of American films, because it burlesqued religion. In a letter to Schlesinger, Breen complained about the scenes set in a parodic Heaven known as [...] "Pair-O-Dice" [...] and said, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> such scenes would give serious offense to many people {{in all parts of the}} world." [...] Authorities also requested that Schlesinger remove the halo from one of the black characters. The letter does not specify to what exactly Breen objected, but musicologist Daniel Goldmark speculates that it was the idea of Heaven being run by blacks and the cartoon's implication that Heaven holds a place for [...] "gamblers, dancers, drinkers, and, above all else, jazz fans", making it [...] "even more threatening to white viewers." [...] Schlesinger managed to quell the censors by making alterations, such as cutting the phrase [...] "De Lawd". The short debuted in theatres on May 22, 1937. Tin Pan Alley Cats, a 1943 cartoon directed by Bob Clampett, was inspired in part by Clean Pastures and has a similar theme of redemption.|$|E
