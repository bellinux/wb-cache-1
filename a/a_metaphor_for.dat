Miguel titled Kaleidoscope Dream as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> life and wanted the songs to reflect his lifestyle and personality.|$|E
5|$|Wentworth Arthur Matthew {{founded the}} Commandment Keepers Congregation in Harlem in 1919.

5|$|Among {{the most}} famous of these bird artists was John James Audubon, whose {{paintings}} of North American birds were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the National Audubon Society. Birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, Homer incorporated nightingales into his Odyssey, and Catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his Catullus 2. The relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which led {{to the use of the}} term as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> a 'burden'. Other English metaphors derive from birds; vulture funds and vulture investors, for instance, take their name from the scavenging vulture.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{was still}} {{divided by the}} {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War. Menem proposed an agenda of national reconciliation.

Menem intended to use the reconciliation of these historical Argentine figures as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> the reconciliation of the Dirty War. However, although the repatriation and acceptance of Rosas was a success, the acceptance of the military regime was not.|$|E

Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters' need to sift through this information.|$|E

5|$|Heavy Traffic is a 1973 American adult {{animated}} comedy-drama film {{written and}} directed by Ralph Bakshi. The film, which begins, ends, and occasionally combines with live-action, explores the often surreal fantasies of a young New York cartoonist named Michael Corleone, using pinball imagery as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> inner-city life. Heavy Traffic was Bakshi and producer Steve Krantz's follow-up to the film Fritz the Cat. Though producer Krantz made varied attempts to produce an R-rated film, Heavy Traffic was given an X rating by the MPAA. The film received positive reviews and is widely considered to be Bakshi's biggest critical success.|$|E
5|$|In English, {{the term}} 'guinea pig' is {{commonly}} used as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> a subject of scientific experimentation, or any experiment or test in modern times. This {{dates back to the}} early 20th century; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913. In 1933, Consumers Research founders F. J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs, extending the metaphor to consumer society. The book became a national bestseller in the United States, thus further popularizing the term, and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement. The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs by Czech author Ludvík Vaculík as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism.|$|E

5|$|The Time Traveler's Wife is {{the debut}} novel of American author Audrey Niffenegger, {{published}} in 2003. It {{is a love}} story about {{a man with a}} genetic disorder that causes him to time travel unpredictably, and about his wife, an artist, who has to cope with his frequent absences and dangerous experiences. Niffenegger, frustrated in love when she began the work, wrote the story as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> her failed relationships. The tale's central relationship came to her suddenly and subsequently supplied the novel's title. The novel, which has been classified as both science fiction and romance, examines issues of love, loss, and free will. In particular, it uses time travel to explore miscommunication and distance in relationships, while also investigating deeper existential questions.|$|E
5|$|The legendary herb {{has entered}} the modern Bulgarian {{vocabulary}} as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> a magic key or a panacea in the wider sense. The phrase “to find the razkovniche” („да намериш разковничето“ „da namerish razkovnicheto“) means to find the solution to a certain problem, usually a complex or difficult one. Razkovniche is also the common Bulgarian name for the plant European waterclover (Marsilea quadrifolia) which, in its appearance, has many similarities with the descriptions of the mythical raskovnik. In eastern Serbia, raskovnik also refers to a specific plant used in vernacular medicine, namely Laserpitium siler.|$|E
