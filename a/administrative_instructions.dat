He believed {{that there would be}} [...] "some water" [...] in the Wadi es Saba and Wadi el Imaleh but he was uncertain of the amount, acknowledging that it was [...] "...the driest time of the year." [...] Fortunately for the British plan, though, thunderstorms on 25 October had left pools of water over a wide area. While all possible steps were taken to ensure full and regular supplies, Allenby's <b>administrative</b> <b>instructions</b> included the following caveat: [...] "hese calculations are based on the scale of full mobile rations.

The CAG {{says that}} {{competitive}} bidding {{could have been}} introduced in 2006 by amending the existing <b>administrative</b> <b>instructions.</b> This premise of the CAG is flawed.15. The observation of the CAG {{that the process of}} competitive bidding could have been introduced by amending the <b>administrative</b> <b>instructions</b> is based on the opinion expressed by the Department of Legal Affairs in July and August 2006. However, the CAG's observation is based on a selective reading of the opinions given by the Department of Legal Affairs.16. Initially, the Government had initiated a proposal to introduce competitive bidding by formulating appropriate rules. This matter was referred to the Department of Legal Affairs, which initially opined that amendment to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act would be necessary for this purpose.17. A meeting was convened in the PMO on 25 July 2005 which was attended by representatives of coal and lignite bearing states. In the meeting the representatives of state governments were opposed to the proposed switch over to competitive bidding. It was further noted that the legislative changes that would be required for the proposed change would require considerable time and the process of allocation of coal blocks for captive mining could not be kept in abeyance for so long given the pressing demand for coal. Therefore, it was decided in this meeting to continue with the allocation of coal blocks through the extant Screening Committee procedure till the new competitive bidding procedure became operational. This was a collective decision of the centre and the state governments concerned.18. It was only in August 2006 that the Department of Legal Affairs opined that competitive bidding could be introduced through <b>administrative</b> <b>instructions.</b> However, the same Department also opined that legislative amendments would be required for placing the proposed process on a sound legal footing. In a meeting held in September, 2006, Secretary, Department of Legal Affairs categorically opined that having regard to the nature and scope of the relevant legislation, it would be most appropriate to achieve the objective through amendment to the Mines & Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act.|$|E

40|$|Objective – To {{determine}} whether relationships exist between academic librarians’ learning styles and their professional work responsibilities. Design – Self-selecting survey. Setting – Email listservs. Subjects – 1579 academic librarians. Methods – The authors used the Index of Learning Styles questionnaire, {{based on the}} Felder-Silverman Learning Styles model consisting of eight dimensions on four scales: Active/Reflective, Sensing/Intuitive, Visual/Verbal, and Sequential/Global. The multiple choice survey was distributed online to 23 email listservs for academic librarians in 2011, and to 14 additional listservs in 2013 targeting technical services librarians. 1579 responses were received in total, which were analyzed using ANOVA with a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc mean separation, and descriptively using observed frequencies. Main Results – In examining the relationship between positions and learning styles, the study revealed there to be five statistically significant p-values when the data were analyzed. Catalogers (n= 145) {{were found to be}} more reflective learners compared to Administrative (n= 321) and Instruction librarians (n= 228) at the p = 0. 009 level. <b>Administrative,</b> <b>Instruction,</b> and “Other” librarians were found to be more intuitive learners than Catalogers, who {{are more likely to be}} sensing learners, at the p = 0. 0004 level. Digital librarians (n= 40) are more likely to be visual learners and Catalogers more likely to be sequential learners when compared to several other librarian categories, at the p = 0. 020 and p = 0. 001 levels respectively. Conclusions – The authors concluded that there were some statistically significant differences between librarians’ learning styles scores according to job responsibilities. Catalogers were found to have different learning styles than other types of librarians for three out of four scales. Based on these findings, the authors indicate that further research into how librarians’ work responsibilities impact learning styles is justified...|$|R

40|$|In China and {{a number}} of other countries, recent years have seen a {{prevailing}} trend in collective and cooperative urban development, transforming individual cities to polycentric metropolis. Such a phenomenon, also termed urban agglomeration by some researchers in China, has gradually become the main body of urbanization and the basic terrain unit in participating international competition and international division of labor. However, the spatial delimitation of urban agglomeration has been historically heavily influenced by subjective <b>administrative</b> <b>instruction,</b> as opposed to being primarily driven by radiation effects by regional central cities. To better delimitate the urban agglomeration sphere in China and other fast-developing areas, this work seeks to scientifically assess and comprehensively delimitate the spatial patterns of regional central cities' radiation through quantitative analysis and modeling. Zhengzhou, a typical regional central city in central China is chosen as the study case. First, it makes a modification to the traditional gravity model by constructing a radiation quality index (RQI) and integrating distances representing commuter traffic, economic development gap, and cultural psychological factors. Subsequently, a comprehensive delimitation is derived that demarcates and describes Zhengzhou's urban radiation toward 42 neighboring cities by applying the radiation field intensity model, radiation effect function, and judgment vectors of the urban radiation ring-layer model. The chief findings are that Zhengzhou's radiation effect is not prominent compared to other similar provincial capital-level cities. There is no distinct psychological or spatial differentiation between Zhengzhou and its 42 neighboring cities. The economic distance between Zhengzhou and other cities has been stable, and has even shrunk, whereas there are notable differences among fixed range ring patterns. The interaction forces between Zhengzhou and neighboring cities have increased, and radiation field intensity of Zhengzhou has been expanded to outer rings. However, some cities along the provincial boundary received very limited influence from Zhengzhou, and are significantly more influenced by other radiation sources. In 2001 and 2009, there were 26 and 24 cities that fell in Zhengzhou's urban radiation rings, respectively, whereas only seven cities were included in the core and primary radiation ring. This list of seven cities excluded Luohe City, in spite of its administrative inclusion within Zhengzhou. Zhengzhou's urban radiation ring contracts in its southern and western quadrants, whereas it expands in the eastern and northern quadrants. This finding prompts the authors to advocate the city of Zhengzhou to prioritize on expanding its radiation to the southeastern area around the Zhongyuan Urban Agglomeration. Such balanced development could prove beneficial to not only Zhengzhou City, but also the entire Henan Province. 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|R
