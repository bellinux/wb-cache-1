5|$|A scene between Skinner and The Smoking Man {{was removed}} from the final cut due to time considerations, {{reducing}} his role in the episode to a very short dialogue-less appearance. Another scene where Mulder questions Skinner's allegiance was also removed when it was viewed <b>as</b> <b>too</b> combative. The episode title means the incarnation of a deity in Sanskrit.|$|E

5|$|Aspects of Scouting {{practice}} {{have been}} criticized <b>as</b> <b>too</b> militaristic. Military-style uniforms, badges of rank, flag ceremonies, and brass bands were commonly accepted {{in the early years}} because they were a part of normal society, but since then have diminished or been abandoned in both Scouting and society.|$|E
5|$|Baronius {{came within}} 9 votes of election, with 32 of the electors {{supporting}} him, {{but he refused}} to advocate his own election or accept election by acclamation. Aldobrandini was unable to convince some members of his faction to vote for Baronius because they viewed him <b>as</b> <b>too</b> strict, and by 30 March he had resigned himself to look for other candidates.|$|E
5|$|One of Euler's {{more unusual}} {{interests}} was {{the application of}} mathematical ideas in music. In 1739 he wrote the Tentamen novae theoriae musicae, hoping to eventually incorporate musical theory as part of mathematics. This part of his work, however, did not receive wide attention and was once described <b>as</b> <b>too</b> mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees {{finished}} 79–75 in 1959, {{in third}} place, their worst record since 1925, as the White Sox, managed by Lopez, won the pennant. There was considerable criticism of Stengel, who was viewed <b>as</b> <b>too</b> old {{and out of}} touch with the players.|$|E
5|$|The opening was {{rejected}} <b>as</b> <b>too</b> expensive to film; Flinn mentioned the exotic locales would {{have pushed the}} budget to $50million. While they tried {{to hold on to}} the opening as long as they could, Paramount threatened to cancel pre-production unless a few million dollars were cut from the budget.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} investigations levelled accusations at Silverio Nungo (who {{was later}} executed) and Lazaro Kavandame, FRELIMO leader in Cabo Delgado. The latter {{had made no}} secret of his distrust of Mondlane, seeing him <b>as</b> <b>too</b> conservative a leader, and the Tanzanian police also accused him of working with PIDE (Portugal's secret police) to assassinate Mondlane. Kavandame himself surrendered to the Portuguese in April of that year.|$|E

5|$|According to Sharaf, 1934–1937 was {{the happiest}} period of Reich's {{personal}} life, despite the professional problems. His relationship with Elsa Lindenberg {{was good and}} he considered marrying her. When she became pregnant in 1935, they were initially overjoyed, buying clothes and furniture for the child, but doubts developed for Reich, who saw the future <b>as</b> <b>too</b> unsettled. To Lindenberg's great distress, Sharaf writes, Reich insisted on an abortion, at that time illegal. They went to Berlin, where the psychoanalyst Edith Jacobson helped to arrange it.|$|E
5|$|After the Gdańsk Agreement, the Polish {{government}} was under increasing {{pressure from the}} Soviet Union to take action and strengthen its position. Stanisław Kania was viewed by Moscow <b>as</b> <b>too</b> independent, and on October 18, 1981, the Party Central Committee {{put him in the}} minority. Kania lost his post as First Secretary, and was replaced by Prime Minister (and Minister of Defence) Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who adopted a strong-arm policy.|$|E
5|$|After the altercation with Gauguin, Van Gogh {{returned}} to his room, where he was assaulted by voices and severed his left ear with a razor (either wholly or in part; accounts differ), causing severe bleeding. He bandaged the wound, wrapped the ear in paper, and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented. Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital, where Félix Rey, a young doctor still in training, treated him. The ear was delivered to the hospital, but Rey {{did not attempt to}} reattach it <b>as</b> <b>too</b> much time had passed.|$|E

5|$|Before the war, New Albany was {{the largest}} city in the state, mainly because of its river {{contacts}} and extensive trade with the South. Over half of Hoosiers with over $100,000 lived in New Albany. During the war, the trade with the South came to a halt, and many residents considered those of New Albany <b>as</b> <b>too</b> friendly to the South. The city never regained its stature. It was stilled as a city of 40,000 with its early-Victorian Mansion-Row buildings remaining from the boom period.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} development, {{multiple}} {{members of}} staff voiced dissatisfaction with the final product. Ito and Suzuki felt that the portrayals of the Law and Chaos Heroes were imbalanced, with the Chaos Hero being too emotional and the Law Hero being unsympathetic. They also saw the demon fusion system <b>as</b> <b>too</b> difficult for players to master. Okada, while commenting on what improvements would {{be made for the}} next game, stated that there were too many useless items in the game. Niino felt that the game's pacing and flow needed to be addressed, as after naming the characters, the player immediately is prompted to divide their status points.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{personal}} {{effects of the}} characters that were familiar to the public {{were added to the}} sets. The prologue and climactic scene in the Granita restaurant was shot on location in the restaurant itself. Frears subdued Berrington's performance to avoid portraying Cherie <b>as</b> <b>too</b> much of a Lady Macbeth figure; in the scene where Cherie encourages Blair to stand for the leadership, Frears had Berrington stand with her back towards the camera. Editing and post-production went on until September. Some historical events—such as the Sheffield Rally and footage of the 1997 general election—were too costly to refilm so archive footage was used instead. Adam Curtis assisted in the editing of the archive footage.|$|E

5|$|Chaffee {{was given}} a variety of assignments, and participated in {{numerous}} training duties {{over the next few}} years, spending {{most of his time in}} photo reconnaissance squadrons. He was stationed at NAS Jacksonville as safety officer and quality control officer for Heavy Photographic Squadron 62 (VAP-62) flying the A3D. He wrote a quality control manual for the squadron, although some of his peers saw this <b>as</b> <b>too</b> demanding. By coincidence, he was assigned to a mission where he flew over Cape Canaveral, during which aerial photographs of future launch sites were taken.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} early 1847, but {{relationships}} between the LB and SER broke down quickly. The SER were unhappy about the proposed line from Rye to Hastings via , which they viewed <b>as</b> <b>too</b> expensive compared to the alternative route via Whatlington. The LB objected to this route as it was longer, and consequently the SER dropped their proposals in November 1847. The land over Romney Marsh was unstable, and test trains were seen to tip over in heavy winds. The line was originally proposed to be single-track, though this was changed to double-track in June 1850.|$|E
5|$|Despite Venice's {{economic}} and maritime decline, in 1601 {{at the behest}} of the Doge Marino Grimani, the Venetian Senate decided to have a new bucentaur built at the cost of 70,000 ducats; although the existing one was still in service, experts regarded it <b>as</b> <b>too</b> old. The designer of the new ship is unknown, but he was selected from among the most qualified marangoni (ships' carpenters) of the Arsenale. The work was supervised by Marco Antonio Memmo, the sovraprovveditore (overseer of the provveditore) of the Arsenale. The new vessel was approved and praised by all on its maiden voyage to the Lido with the newly elected Doge Leonardo Donato on Ascension Day, 10 May 1606.|$|E
