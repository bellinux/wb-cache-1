5|$|The {{peripheral}} nerves of the parasympathetic {{nervous system}} that carry messages to the brain (<b>afferent</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers) may explain why people with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations. One proposed explanation for orgasm in women despite complete SCI is that the vagus nerve bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly to the brain. Women with complete injuries can achieve sexual arousal and orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris, cervix, or vagina, which are each innervated by different nerve pathways, which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area, function might be preserved in others. In both injured and uninjured people, the brain {{is responsible for the}} way sensations of climax are perceived: the qualitative experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain, rather than a specific area of the body.|$|E
25|$|Nociceptors were {{discovered}} by Charles Scott Sherrington in 1906. In earlier centuries, scientists believed that animals were like mechanical devices that transformed {{the energy of}} sensory stimuli into motor responses. Sherrington used many different experiments to demonstrate that different types of stimulation to an <b>afferent</b> <b>nerve</b> fiber's receptive field led to different responses. Some intense stimuli trigger reflex withdrawal, certain autonomic responses, and pain. The specific receptors for these intense stimuli were called nociceptors.|$|E
25|$|The ghrelin {{receptor}} GHS-R1a (a splice-variant of {{the growth}} hormone secretagogue receptor, with the GHS-R1b splice being inactive) is involved in mediating {{a wide variety of}} biological effects of ghrelin, including: stimulation of growth hormone release, increase in hunger, modulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, regulation of gastrointestinal motility and secretion, protection of neuronal and cardiovascular cells, and regulation of immune function. They are present in high density in the hypothalamus and pituitary, on the vagus nerve (on both afferent cell bodies and <b>afferent</b> <b>nerve</b> endings) and throughout the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E

40|$|Three {{groups of}} receptors {{in the heart}} are {{activated}} by changes in pressure in the cardiac chambers.

A second group, present in all the cardiac chambers, served by unmyelinated vagal <b>afferent</b> <b>nerves,</b> signals changes in ventricular preload, afterload and cardiac contractility. A third group, also present in all the cardiac chambers, has both myelinated and unmyelinated <b>afferent</b> <b>nerves</b> that pass to the spinal cord. Their normal function is unknown. Abnormal activation of the cardiac mechanoreceptors during myocardial ischemia may be important in the genesis of life-threatening arrhythmias...|$|R
25|$|This {{represents}} one of the earliest theories on the subject of referred pain. It is {{based on the work of}} W.A. Sturge and J. Ross from 1888 and later TC Ruch in 1961. Convergent projection proposes that <b>afferent</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers from tissues converge onto the same spinal neuron, and explains why referred pain is believed to be segmented in much the same way as the spinal cord. Additionally, experimental evidence shows that when local pain (pain at the site of stimulation) is intensified the referred pain is intensified as well.|$|E
25|$|Complementing this, <b>afferent</b> <b>nerve</b> fibres {{have been}} found that project to early visual {{areas such as the}} lingual gyrus from late in the dorsal (action) and ventral (perception) visual streams, {{as well as from the}} {{auditory}} association cortex. Feedback projections have also been observed in the opossum directly from the auditory association cortex to V1. This last observation currently highlights a point of controversy within the neuroscientific community. Sadato et al. (2004) concluded, in line with Bernstein et al. (2002), that the primary auditory cortex (A1) was functionally distinct from the auditory association cortex, in that it was void of any interaction with the visual modality. They hence concluded that A1 would not at all be effected by cross modal plasticity. This concurs with Jones and Powell's (1970) contention that primary sensory areas are connected only to other areas of the same modality.|$|E
25|$|Nociceptor neuron {{sensitivity}} is modulated {{by a large}} {{variety of}} mediators in the extracellular space. Peripheral sensitization represents a form of functional plasticity of the nociceptor. The nociceptor can change from being simply a noxious stimulus detector to a detector of non-noxious stimuli. The result is that low intensity stimuli from regular activity, initiates a painful sensation. This {{is commonly known as}} hyperalgesia. Inflammation is one common cause that results in the sensitization of nociceptors. Normally hyperalgesia ceases when inflammation goes down, however, sometimes genetic defects and/or repeated injury can result in allodynia: a completely non-noxious stimulus like light touch causes extreme pain. Allodynia can also be caused when a nociceptor is damaged in the peripheral nerves. This can result in deafferentation, which means the development of different central processes from the surviving <b>afferent</b> <b>nerve.</b> With this situation, surviving dorsal root axons of the nociceptors can make contact with the spinal cord, thus changing the normal input.|$|E
40|$|Capsaicin {{sensitive}} <b>afferent</b> <b>nerves</b> play {{an important}} role in gastric mucosal defensive mechanisms. Capsaicin stimulates <b>afferent</b> <b>nerves</b> and enhances the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which seems to be the predominant neurotransmitter of spinal afferents in the rat stomach, exerting many pharmacological effects by a direct mechanism or indirectly through second messengers such as nitric oxide (NO). Lafutidine is a new type of anti-ulcer drug, possessing both an antisecretory effect, exerted via histamine H 2 receptor blockade, and gastroprotective activities. Studies with certain antagonists or chemical deafferentation techniques suggest the gastroprotective actions of lafutidine to be mediated by capsaicin sensitive <b>afferent</b> <b>nerves,</b> but this is an assumption based on indirect techniques. In order to explain the direct relation of lafutidine to <b>afferent</b> <b>nerves,</b> we conducted the following studies. We determined CGRP and NO release from rat stomach and specific [3 H]-resiniferatoxin (RTX) binding to gastric vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR 1), which binds capsaicin, using EIA, a microdialysis system and a radioreceptor assay, respectively. Lafutidine enhanced both CGRP and NO release from the rat stomach induced by a submaximal dose of capsaicin, but had no effect on specific [3 H]-RTX and capsaicin binding to VR 1. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that lafutidine modulates the activity of capsaicin sensitive <b>afferent</b> <b>nerves</b> in the rat stomach, which may be a key mechanism involved in its gastroprotective action...|$|R

2500|$|Astrocytes detect {{neuronal}} {{activity and}} can release chemical transmitters, {{which in turn}} control synaptic activity. In the past, hyperalgesia {{was thought to be}} modulated by the release of substance P and excitatory amino acids (EAA), such as glutamate, from the presynaptic <b>afferent</b> <b>nerve</b> terminals in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Subsequent activation of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid), NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) and kainate subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors follows. It is the activation of these receptors that potentiates the pain signal up the spinal cord. This idea, although true, is an oversimplification of pain transduction. [...] A litany of other neurotransmitter and neuromodulators, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), galanin, and vasopressin are all synthesized and released in response to noxious stimuli. In addition to each of these regulatory factors, several other interactions between pain-transmitting neurons and other neurons in the dorsal horn have added impact on pain pathways.|$|E
2500|$|In mammals, {{otoliths}} {{are small}} particles, {{composed of a}} combination of a gelatinous matrix and calcium carbonate in the viscous fluid of the saccule and utricle. The inertia of these small particles causes them to stimulate hair cells when the head moves. The hair cells are made up of 40 to 70 stereocilia and one kinocilium, which is connected to an <b>afferent</b> <b>nerve.</b> When the body changes position or begins a movement the weight of the membrane bends the stereocilia and stimulates the hair cells. Hair cells send signals down sensory nerve fibers, which are interpreted by the brain as motion. The brain interprets the orientation of the head by comparing the input from the utricules and saccules from both ears to the input from the eyes, allowing the brain to discriminate a tilted head from movement of the entire body. When the head is in a normal upright position, the otolith presses on the sensory hair cell receptors. [...] This pushes the hair cell processes down and prevents them from moving side to side. However, when the head is tilted, the pull of gravity on otoliths shift the hair cell processes to the side, distorting them and sending a message to the central nervous system that the head is no longer level but now tilted. (see: BPPV) This theory may have to be reevaluated because of an experiment in which a blindfolded owl in zero gravity was able to keep its head level while a handler was rocking its body back and forth.|$|E

These examples of muscular movements which occur independently of the will, or in spite of it, illustrate what physiologists call reflex-action; as likewise do sneezing and coughing. To this class of cases, in which involuntary motions are accompanied by sensations, has to be added another class of cases, in which involuntary motions are unaccompanied by sensations:--instance the pulsations of the heart; the contractions of the stomach during digestion. Further, the great mass of seemingly-voluntary acts in such creatures as insects, worms, molluscs, are considered by physiologists to be as purely automatic as is the dilatation or closure of the iris under variations in quantity of light; and similarly exemplify the law, that an impression {{on the end of}} an <b>afferent</b> <b>nerve</b> is conveyed to some ganglionic centre, and is thence usually reflected along an efferent nerve to one or more muscles which it causes to contract.|$|E

40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the {{critical}} pathophysiological significance of capsaicin-sensitive trigeminal primary afferent neurons in the mechanisms of neurovascular responses in animal models of cranial pain and their possible relevance for primary headaches. In the rat dura mater, neurogenic sensory vasodilator responses elicited by activation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV 1) receptor are mediated by the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from sensory nerves, which suggests that similar mechanisms may operate in man during migraine attacks, when an increased concentration of CGRP is measured in the jugular venous blood. Capsaicin-sensitive trigeminal <b>afferent</b> <b>nerves</b> {{also contribute to the}} vasodilatory responses induced by the activation of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR- 2), which involves the release of CGRP from capsaicin-sensitive <b>afferent</b> <b>nerves.</b> Importantly, the activation of PAR- 2 has been shown to sensitize the TRPV 1 receptor. Demonstration of the colocalization of PAR- 2 and TRPV 1 receptors in the meningeal axons lends further support to this mechanism. Neurogenic vasodilatory responses mediated by capsaicin-sensitive <b>afferent</b> <b>nerves</b> may serve a protective function via the elimination of inflammatory mediators from the tissue, a mechanism which {{may play a role in}} the resolution of headaches. Pathological conditions such as diabetes mellitus may compromise this protective mechanism through decreases in the expression of TRPV 1 and the release of CGRP. These observations indicate an important role of capsaicin-sensitive meningeal <b>afferent</b> <b>nerves</b> in the pathophysiology of headaches and suggest that pharmacological manipulation of the TRPV 1 receptor may offer a promising approach to the management of headaches. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd...|$|R
50|$|<b>Afferent</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers {{responsible}} for sensory stimulus detection and feedback are especially sensitive to stimulation.

Responses of cortical {{cerebral blood flow}} and uterine blood flow are characterized as nonsegmental and segmental reflexes. Among acupuncture-like stimuli delivered to five different segmental areas of the body; afferent inputs to the brain stem (face) and to the spinal cord at the cervical (forepaw), thoracic (chest or abdomen), lumbar (hindpaw) and sacral (perineum) levels, cortical cerebral blood flow was increased by stimuli to face, forepaw and hindpaw. The afferent pathway of the responses is composed of somatic groups III and IV <b>afferent</b> <b>nerves</b> and whose efferent nerve pathway includes intrinsic cholinergic vasodilators originating in the basal forebrain.
