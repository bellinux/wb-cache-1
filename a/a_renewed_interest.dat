5|$|The idea of token {{identity}} {{is that only}} particular occurrences of mental events are identical with particular occurrences or tokenings of physical events. Anomalous monism (see below) and most other non-reductive physicalisms are token-identity theories. Despite these problems, there is <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> in the type identity theory today, primarily due {{to the influence of}} Jaegwon Kim.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, many post-grunge bands {{adopted a}} hard rock sound {{and in the}} 2000s there came <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> in {{established}} bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands {{that emerged from the}} garage rock and post-punk revival scenes. Out of this movement came garage rock bands like the White Stripes, the Strokes, Interpol and, later on, the Black Keys. In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.|$|E

5|$|The Second Boer War catalysed <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> in {{establishing}} a unit composed of Scottish Liverpudlians. On 30 April 1900, the 8th (Scottish) Volunteer Battalion was formed within the King's (Liverpool Regiment), with headquarters later being located at 22 Highgate Street, Edge Hill. The Liverpool Scottish became one of four battalions in English infantry regiments to explicitly associate with the Irish and Scottish communities - the other battalions were the London Scottish, Liverpool Irish and London Irish Rifles.|$|E
5|$|The {{last half}} of the 19th century saw a {{tremendous}} expansion in paleontological activity, especially in North America. The trend continued in the 20th century with additional regions of the Earth being opened to systematic fossil collection, as demonstrated by a series of important discoveries in China {{near the end of the}} 20th century. Many transitional fossils have been discovered, and there is now considered to be abundant evidence of how all classes of vertebrates are related, much of it in the form of transitional fossils. The last few decades of the 20th century saw <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> in mass extinctions and their role in the evolution of life on Earth. There was also <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> in the Cambrian explosion that saw the development of the body plans of most animal phyla. The discovery of fossils of the Ediacaran biota and developments in paleobiology extended knowledge about the history of life back far before the Cambrian.|$|E
5|$|Hilda Campbell Vaughan (married name Morgan; 12 June 1892 – 4 November 1985) was a Welsh {{novelist and}} short story writer writing in English. Her ten varied novels, set mostly {{in her native}} Radnorshire, concern rural {{communities}} and heroines. Her first was The Battle to the Weak (1925) and her last The Candle and the Light, published in 1954. She was married to the writer Charles Langbridge Morgan, who had an influence on her writings. Although favourably received by her contemporaries, Vaughan subsequently received minimal critical attention. Rediscovery of her work began in the 1980s and 1990s, as part of <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> in Welsh literature in English.|$|E

5|$|Although {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced}} to Europe in the 14thcentury, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15thcentury, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls. While castles continued to be built well into the 16thcentury, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live. As a result, true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with no role in civil administration, and country houses that were indefensible. From the 18thcentury onwards, there was <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> in castles {{with the construction of}} mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no military purpose.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} of the imagination, and a free-flowing connection to the unconscious brought about <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> in his work. Bosch's imagery struck a chord with Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of Bosch's Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|E
5|$|In 1964–65 <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> in Shanina {{arose in}} the Soviet press, {{largely due to the}} {{publication}} of her diary. The newspaper Severny Komsomolets asked Shanina's contemporaries to write what they knew about her. Streets in Arkhangelsk, Shangaly and Stroyevskoye were named after her, and the village of Yedma has a museum dedicated to Shanina. The local school where she studied in 1931–35 has a commemorative plate. In Arkhangelsk, regular shooting competitions were organized among members of the paramilitary DOSAAF sport organisation for the Roza Shanina Prize, while Novodvinsk organized an open shooting sports championship in her memory. The village of Malinovka in Ustyansky District started to hold annual cross-country ski races for the Roza Shanina Prize.|$|E
40|$|Improvements in {{surgical}} {{techniques and}} prosthetic devices {{and the establishment}} of prosthetic clinics have altered the outlook for the amputee. A cooperative effect on the part of professionals looking after amputee patients, as carried out in these clinics, offers the best means of recognition and treatment of difficulties as they arise. Until the "bionic man" becomes a reality, amputees will continue to have skin problems. In describing a number of illustrative cases, we have attempted to: (<b>a)</b> <b>renew</b> <b>interest</b> in these problems; (b) demonstrate the value of the group approach; and (c) encourage the participation of interested dermatologists in the prosthetic clinic team to facilitate earlier recognition and treatment of troublesome skin disorders in the amputee...|$|R

5|$|One area of {{paleontology}} {{that has}} {{seen a lot of}} activity during the 1980s, 1990s, and beyond is the study of the Cambrian explosion during which many of the various phyla of animals with their distinctive body plans first appear. The well-known Burgess Shale Cambrian fossil site was found in 1909 by Charles Doolittle Walcott, and another important site in Chengjiang China was found in 1912. However, new analysis in the 1980s by Harry B. Whittington, Derek Briggs, Simon Conway Morris and others sparked <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> and a burst of activity including discovery of an important new fossil site, Sirius Passet, in Greenland, and the publication of a popular and controversial book, Wonderful Life by Stephen Jay Gould in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Organ {{music was}} seldom {{written in the}} Classical era, as composers {{preferred}} the piano with its ability to create dynamics. In Germany, the six sonatas op. 65 of Felix Mendelssohn (published 1845) {{marked the beginning of}} <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> in composing for the organ. Inspired by the newly built Cavaillé-Coll organs, the French organist-composers César Franck, Alexandre Guilmant and Charles-Marie Widor led organ music into the symphonic realm. The development of symphonic organ music continued with Louis Vierne and Charles Tournemire. Widor and Vierne wrote large-scale, multi-movement works called organ symphonies that exploited the full possibilities of the symphonic organ. Max Reger and Sigfrid Karg-Elert's symphonic works made use of the abilities of the large Romantic organs being built in Germany at the time.|$|E

This started the process of Norway becoming a full member of ESA in 1987. The telemetry station received investments of NOK100 million during the 1980s and was organized as a foundation in 1984. It took the name Tromsø Satellite Station in 1988. Part of {{the goal of the}} project was to create technical spin-offs; the one successful company was Spacetec, which had 45 employees {{at the time it was}} bought by Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace in 1994.
