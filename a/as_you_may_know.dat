500|$|Controversy arose for the {{commercial}} {{when it was}} reported that Lopez did not return to The Bronx to shoot {{the commercial}}. Instead, Lopez filmed her close-up shots in Los Angeles, while a body double was used for the car scenes through The Bronx. Fiat and Lopez were slammed for false advertising Lopez's return to The Bronx. Fiat released a statement stating: [...] "Both commercials featuring Jennifer Lopez were indeed filmed in the Bronx as well as outside locations. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>know,</b> in today's world, people are increasingly mobile and their work takes them to a variety of locations. As a result, we took the opportunity to film wherever Ms. Lopez was working at the time to accommodate her schedule. The commercial tells the story of how the simple elements of our upbringing can help explain who we are, where we're going and serve as a source of inspiration to achieve our goals in life. One {{does not need to be}} in a specific location to be inspired or continue to be inspired." ...|$|E

40|$|As a society, we have {{designed}} a transportation system {{that appears to}} work quite well for most of us; {{all we have to}} do is hop into a car and we are going places! Unfortunately, that system doesn’t work for all of us. The barrier to participation is really quite high. One must be able to afford a car, to maintain a car, and to insure a car and one must be able to drive - otherwise the system doesn’t offer much. In order to receive at least some benefit, access by the non-driver must be facilitated.

2500|$|Earnhardt is a {{longtime}} opponent of the modern display of the Confederate flag at NASCAR events. He wrote in his 2001 autobiography Driver #8 about his experience being asked about the flag in a Q at Richmond International Raceway the previous year. [...] "I think it means something different to me {{than it does to}} y'all..." [...] he responded. He has distanced himself from race fans who display the flag, telling Mike Wallace in 2004 [...] "It never really was me." [...] In 2006, Earnhardt told Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports: [...] "We live in a country where you can speak freely and do <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>may.</b> I don't <b>know</b> (if) what that flag stands for is the same for me as it is the guy who might have it flying out there. I am not going to agree with everything everybody does all my life. So I don't have any control over it." [...] Following the Charleston church shooting in 2015, Earnhardt told reporters: [...] "I think it's offensive to an entire race. It does nothing for anybody to be there flying, so I don't see any reason. It belongs in the history books and that's about it." ...|$|R

"Well, we {{will now}} deal with Sir George Wilde, who is, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> not <b>know,</b> the senior partner of Wilde and Guggendorf, {{the founders of the}} Ludgate Bank of infamous memory. His chauffeur is a case apart. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> take it from me, upon my word of honour, that I had plans for the chauffeur. But it is the master that I want to speak of. You know that I am not a rich man myself. I expect all the county knows that. When Black Tulip lost the Derby I was hard hit. And other things as well. Then I had a legacy of a thousand. This infernal bank was paying 7 per cent. on deposits. I knew Wilde. I saw him. I asked him if it was safe. He said it was. I paid it in, and within forty-eight hours the whole thing went to bits. It came out before the Official Receiver that Wilde had known for three months that nothing could save him. And yet he took all my cargo aboard his sinking vessel. He was all right--confound him! He had plenty besides. But I had lost all my money and no law could help me. Yet he had robbed me as clearly as one man could rob another. I saw him and he laughed in my face. Told me to stick to Consols, and that the lesson was cheap at the price. So I just swore that, by hook or by crook, I would get level with him. I knew his habits, for I had made it my {{business}} to do so. I knew that he came back from Eastbourne on Sunday nights. I knew that he carried a good sum with him in his pocket-book. Well it's my pocket-book now. Do {{you mean to tell me}} that I'm not morally justified in what I have done?

The {{combined}} princes of this league formed against him have made such proposals of composition and peace, as, in other circumstances, it might have become his honour to have granted to them. Others have made private offers, on their own separate account, to disjoin their forces from the camp of the Kings of Frangistan, and even to lend their arms to the defence of the standard of the Prophet. But Saladin will not be served by such treacherous and interested defection. The king of kings will treat only with the Lion King. Saladin will hold treaty with none but the Melech Ric, and with him he will treat like a prince, or fight like a champion. To Richard he will yield such conditions of his free liberality as the swords of all Europe could never compel from him by force or terror. He will permit a free pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and all the places where the Nazarenes list to worship; nay, he will so far share even his empire with his brother Richard, that he will allow Christian garrisons in the six strongest cities of Palestine, and one in Jerusalem itself, and suffer them to be under the immediate command of the officers of Richard, who, he consents, shall bear the name of King Guardian of Jerusalem. Yet further, strange and incredible <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> think it, <b>know,</b> Sir Knight--for to your honour I can commit even that almost incredible secret--know that Saladin will put a sacred seal on this happy union betwixt the bravest and noblest of Frangistan and Asia, by raising to the rank of his royal spouse a Christian damsel, allied in blood to King Richard, and known by the name of the Lady Edith of Plantagenet." [...] [This may appear so extraordinary and improbable a proposition {{that it is necessary to}} say such a one was actually made. The historians, however, substitute the widowed Queen of Naples, sister of Richard, for the bride, and Saladin's brother for the bridegroom. They appear to have been ignorant of the existence of Edith of Plantagenet.--See MILL'S History of the Crusades, vol. ii., p. 61.] ...|$|R
