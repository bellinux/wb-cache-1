2500|$|Metal {{substrates}} {{for use in}} SAMs can {{be produced}} through physical vapor deposition techniques, electrodeposition or electroless deposition. Thiol or selenium SAMs produced by adsorption from solution are typically made by immersing a substrate into a dilute solution of alkane thiol in ethanol, though many different solvents can be used besides use of pure liquids. While SAMs are often allowed to form over 12 to 72 hours at room temperature, SAMs of alkanethiolates form within minutes. Special attention is essential in some cases, {{such as that of}} dithiol SAMs to avoid problems due to oxidation or photoinduced processes, which can affect terminal groups and lead to disorder and multilayer formation. In this case appropriate choice of solvents, their degassing by inert gasses and preparation in the absence of light is crucial and allows formation of [...] "standing up" [...] SAMs with free –SH groups. Self-assembled monolayers can also be adsorbed from the vapor phase. In some cases when obtaining an ordered assembly is difficult or when different density phases need to be obtained substitutional self-assembly is used. Here one first forms the SAM of a given type of molecules, which give rise to ordered assembly and then a second <b>assembly</b> <b>phase</b> is performed (e.g. by immersion into a different solution). This method has also been used to give information on relative binding strengths of SAMs with different head groups and more generally on self-assembly characteristics.|$|E

5000|$|Hebb viewed {{motivation}} and learning as related properties. He believed that {{everything in the}} brain was interrelated and worked together. His theory was that everything we experience in our environment fires a set of neurons called a cell assembly. This cell assembly is the brain's thoughts or ideas. These cell assemblies then work together to form phase sequences, which are streams of thoughts. [...] Once these cell <b>assemblies</b> and <b>phase</b> sequences are formed, they can be activated by stimulation from the environment. Therefore, the more stimulating and rich the environment, the more the cell assemblies grow and learn. This theory played into his beliefs in education. Hebb believed that the environment {{was very important to}} learning in children. Children learn by building up these cell <b>assemblies</b> and <b>phase</b> sequences. An enriched environment with varied opportunities for sensory and motor experiences contribute to children developing the cell <b>assemblies</b> and <b>phase</b> sequences necessary for continued learning in adulthood.

The opening of another sedimentary basin during the Delhi orogeny (~-1,100 Ma) coincided with the time where the supercontinent Columbia broke up, and the cessation of basin development followed by a compressional phase was concurrent with the assembly of Rodinia. The deposition of the upper Vindhyan Supergroup may also denote the final episode of Rodinia formation. Several geochemical analyses show that detrital zircon samples obtained from the Marwar basin are highly linked to the breakup phase of Rodinia and the <b>assembly</b> <b>phase</b> of Gondwana.|$|E

Those DNA-tumor viruses that replicate in the nucleus use cellular mechanisms to transport their genome and newly synthesized viral proteins into the nucleus.

Agents that employ this strategy include adenoviruses, hepadnaviruses, herpesviruses, and likely also papillomaviruses, and polyomaviruses, but not poxviruses which replicate in the cytoplasm. Here, we discuss how DNA-tumor viruses enter cells, take advantage of cytoplasmic transport, and import their DNA genome through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus.
