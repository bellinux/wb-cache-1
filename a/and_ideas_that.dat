5|$|In 2010, Letlive {{began writing}} on the third album. Butler said that their writing {{approach}} changed in comparison to their previous releases, as they were now doing most of it while on tour. During pre-production, the band listened to styles <b>and</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that,</b> according to Butler, changed the way {{they looked at the}} songs they had initially written. The styles were their most expansive to date, and came from the diversity of their members: Butler had involved himself in the punk rock skateboarding culture when he was eleven, but had also been influenced by his father, who was in a soul band.|$|E
5|$|The smaller {{time frame}} of {{development}} for Left Behind gave the team {{an opportunity to}} trial mechanics <b>and</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> {{they were unable to}} test on the main game. With the game's combat, an added feature was to allow players to focus the attention of the Infected towards human enemies, allowing an easier escape. The gameplay was also more focused on the characters, as opposed to the combat, to allow players to relate to them more. The gameplay sequences were designed to contrast with other moments of Ellie's life; for example, the water gun fight with Riley is contrasted to the gunfights with enemies. The team found that creating some gameplay mechanics was a challenge, with even fewer combat scenarios in Left Behind than in The Last of Us. The animation of the masks also presented a challenge, due to the number of joints; it took various iterations before the final design was implemented.|$|E
5|$|The Early Middle Ages {{witnessed}} {{the rise of}} monasticism in the West. The shape of European monasticism was determined by traditions <b>and</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> originated with the Desert Fathers of Egypt and Syria. Most European monasteries were of the type that focuses on community experience of the spiritual life, called cenobitism, which was pioneered by Pachomius (d. 348) in the 4th century. Monastic ideals spread from Egypt to Western Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries through hagiographical literature such as the Life of Anthony. Benedict of Nursia (d. 547) wrote the Benedictine Rule for Western monasticism during the 6th century, detailing the administrative and spiritual responsibilities of a community of monks led by an abbot. Monks and monasteries had a deep effect on the religious and political life of the Early Middle Ages, in various cases acting as land trusts for powerful families, centres of propaganda and royal support in newly conquered regions, and bases for missions and proselytisation. They were the main and sometimes only outposts of education and literacy in a region. Many of the surviving manuscripts of the Latin classics were copied in monasteries in the Early Middle Ages. Monks were also the authors of new works, including history, theology, and other subjects, written by authors such as Bede (d. 735), a native of northern England who wrote in the late 7th and early 8th centuries.|$|E

25|$|While Jung {{worked on}} his Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (Psychology of the Unconscious), {{tensions}} became manifest between him and Freud because of their disagreements over the nature of libido and religion. Jung de-emphasized the importance of sexual development {{and focused on the}} collective unconscious: the part of the unconscious that contains memories <b>and</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> Jung believed were inherited from ancestors. While he did think that libido was an important source for personal growth, unlike Freud, Jung did not believe that libido alone was responsible for the formation of the core personality. Jung believed his personal development was influenced by factors he felt were unrelated to sexuality.|$|E

25|$|It {{was also}} in Paris that Acharya's {{thoughts}} were first turned towards socialism. This {{was similar to the}} lines of thought that appeared in the Indian revolutionary circles in Europe, especially in France, at this time. He was introduced to the Socialist circle in Paris in 1910, and enjoyed the congenial atmosphere and the thoughts <b>and</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> he shared. It was also {{with the help of the}} Paris Socialist circle, notably Jean Longuet, that the Paris Indian Society- which included Acharya, Har Dayal, Madam Cama and other notable names- brought pressure on the French Government when Savarkar was rearrested at Marseilles after escaping from a ship that was deporting him to India. Acharya made the most of the available press freedom and the socialist platform to press for the re-extradition of his erstwhile leader to France and build French public opinion in support of such moves. Under public pressure at home, the French Government conceded to make such a request to Britain. The matter was ultimately settled in the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague, which ruled in favour of Britain. Acharya became extensively involved in the socialist movement. The Paris Indian Society at this time grew to be one of the most powerful Indian organisations outside India at the time, and grew to initiate contacts with not only French Socialists, but also those in continental Europe. It sent delegates at this time to the International Socialist Congress in August 1910, where Shyamji Krishna Varma and V.V.S. Iyer succeeded in having a resolution passed demanding Savarkar's release and his extradition to France. It also succeeded in bringing to the attention of the organisation the state of affairs in India.|$|E

This resulted in a monograph titled The City, which was probably compiled from research conducted in 1911–13, and which was published posthumously in 1921.

500|$|The {{game has}} also {{received}} praise for its insight into BDSM and the dom/sub relationship. Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Kieron Gillen {{called it an}} [...] "interesting examination of the master/slave relationship". Rock Paper Shotgun's Alec Meer {{described it as a}} [...] "wry, subversive examination of why videogame protagonists put themselves through a torturous amount of struggle to reach their objectives". James DeRosa praised Anthropy for her implementation of elements <b>and</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> most games do not cover and called it a [...] "hypersexualized, bondage-themed platformer" [...] with which Anthropy [...] "explores the power dynamics of sexuality and disassembles essentialist male and female sex roles as portrayed in video games -- as well as the significance of difficulty and reward as a design method".|$|E
500|$|The {{intrusion}} {{of modern technology}} and attitudes into this idyllic kampung {{way of life is}} also a main topic in the series.

[...] Despite the show's support of the kampung lifestyle, it portrays aspects of modern living in a positive light as well. [...] Opah, an old woman, is depicted as a capable modern woman, proficient in driving a van and fixing televisions. [...] The city is characterized as a gateway to a range of cultures <b>and</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> are not found in a Malaysian rural village, as illustrated in the encounter and formation of a friendship between Mat and a Chinese boy in [...] "Naik Keretaku".|$|E
500|$|The {{stress of}} the project led to the feeling {{there was not enough}} time or money to {{complete}} everything the team wished to, which added to the stress and caused arguments about the design of the game. The developers ended up reducing the overtime they spent on the project to avoid burning out, though it meant further delays and risked the company running out of money as the game neared completion. In a speech at the 16th annual D.I.C.E. Awards in 2013, Chen admitted that the company had indeed been driven to bankruptcy in the final months of development, and that some of the developers had gone unpaid at the time.

[...] Similarly, reviewing for The Guardian, Stuart Christie wrote, [...] "This is a book to be savoured and referred to every so often, even if just to recharge one's moral batteries." [...] In The Globe and Mail, Stan Persky wrote, [...] "What I like about Klein's reflections on the nascent movement that she both participates in and analyzes is that she indulges in minimal rhetorical rah-rah.

500|$|According to Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall, Peace on Earth {{was written}} {{based on the}} {{question}} [...] "How do you know there's peace on earth {{in a world that}} isn't very peaceful?" [...] Hall opined that when people hear Christmas carols, they often don't hear their true message. Hall intended the album to help people rediscover the worshipful nature behind the carols. As an example of a message he wanted people to hear, he gave [...] "I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day", a song written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow about his rediscovery of hope amidst several personal tragedies. Hall felt that the song's message of hope was one that his kids and their generation needed to hear. As a co-producer on the album, Hall wanted to introduce aspects <b>and</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> the band had not done before, and he felt the album offered a chance to branch out. He wanted the band's female members, Megan Garrett and Melodee DeVevo, to play a more prominent role, in part to show people [...] "the gifts they have".|$|E
500|$|Of equal {{importance}} to Burges's subsequent career was his travelling. Burges believed that all architects should travel, remarking {{that it was}} [...] "absolutely necessary to see how various art problems have been resolved in different ages by different men." [...] Enabled by his private income, Burges moved through England, then France, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece and finally into Turkey. In total, he spent some 18 months abroad developing his skills and knowledge by sketching and drawing. What he saw and drew provided a repository of influences <b>and</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> he used and re-used {{for the whole of}} his career. Although he never went beyond Turkey, the art and architecture of the East, both Near and Far, {{had a significant impact on}} him; his fascination with Moorish design found ultimate expression in the Arab Room at Cardiff Castle, and his study of Japanese techniques influenced his later metalwork. Burges received his first important commission at the age of 35, but his subsequent career did not see the development that might have been expected. His style had already been formed over the previous twenty years of study, thinking and travelling. J. Mordaunt Crook, the foremost authority on Burges, writes that, [...] "once established, after twenty years' preparation, his 'design language' had merely to be applied, and he applied and re-applied the same vocabulary with increasing subtlety and gusto." ...|$|E
