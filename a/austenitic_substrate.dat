40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis presents {{research on the}} corrosion properties and effects of heat treatment on austenitic stainless steel coatings produced by the cold gas dynamic spray process on 316 L stainless steel substrates. Previous work {{on the use of}} the low-pressure cold spray process to spray austenitic stainless steel was reproduced and validated. Heat treatment of the coatings was found to reduce porosity and evidence was found of recrystallization of the coatings. No significant changes in elemental distribution were found to occur during heat treatment. Corrosion testing was conducted by salt fog testing and anodic polarization. Coatings in the as-sprayed condition were found to be less corrosion resistant than bulk 316 L stainless steel. Heat treated samples were observed to show corrosion resistance even worse than as-sprayed coatings. In fact, all heat treated samples exhibited little or no passivation behavior. Grain boundary sensitization is suspected to a probable cause for poor corrosion resistance in some samples and the presence of ferrite in the powder and coatings may also be a cause of corrosion resistance that is worse than the fully <b>austenitic</b> <b>substrate.</b> Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|S-phase can {{be created}} in {{austenitic}} stainless steels by low-temperature thermochemical treatments, which greatly enhanced their hardness, wear resistance and fatigue properties because of the supersaturation by interstitials. One of the technological challenges associated with S-phase surface engineering is that the maximum layer thickness of the S-phase layers is very thin. The thickness of S-phase is restricted by its metastability and precipitation will occur {{as a result of}} prolonged treatment. In this project, the effect of in situ tensile stress on the formation of carbon S-phase on 316 L austenitic stainless steel was investigated and it was demonstrated that the tensile stress thickened the S-phase layer by promoting the carbon diffusion in <b>austenitic</b> <b>substrate.</b> However, metastable carbides precipitated when applied tensile stress exceeded 40 MPa. The thermo-mechanical stability of carbon S-phase was studied by creeping (tensile stress) and HIPping (compressive stress) tests. The results showed that the compressive stress retard the decomposition of S-phase by impeding the carbon diffusion; on the other hand, tensile stress promoted the carbon diffusion. The residual compressive and shear stresses in carbon S-phase was measured be 2. 2 GPa and 132 MPa. The wear behaviour of carbon S-phase was studied by dry and oil lubricated reciprocating wear. ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{work on the}} {{oxidation}} of nano- and micro-sized Al particles {{revealed a}} particle size window, where no meta-stable alumina phases were observed. Depositing such particles on an <b>austenitic</b> <b>substrate,</b> diffusion layers with reduced Al contents were obtained. These findings opened new perspectives for investigating {{the potential impact of}} the Al particle size and shape on the formation of diffusion aluminide coatings. Spherical Al particles sized in the range of 2 to 5 µm were deposited with a binder by brushing on the austenitic steel X 6 CrNi 18 - 10 (Alloy 304 H). For the curing process, the samples were annealed in air at 400 degrees C for 1 h. The diffusion effect of Al into the base material was studied in isothermal experiments at 700 degrees C and 900 degrees C with exposure times up to 2000 h in air. The sample surfaces and the diffusion aluminide coatings in cross-section were analysed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The results show in the initial state the formation of a diffusion layer consisting of a less aluminium-rich Fe(Cr) -Al phase containing a Fe(Cr) -Al phase with higher content of Al in the region beneath the surface. On further exposure a double-layered structure is found with Kirkendall-pores between the two layers, which may lead to a complete separation of the outer layer. A thin adherent alumina scale is observed on the remaining diffusion layer after 1000 h and 2000 h at both temperatures, however overgrown by Cr 2 O 3 at 900 degrees C. The structure of the diffusion zone beneath agglomerates of Al particles reveals the influence of the particle size on the Al supply for the formation of the aluminide diffusion zone...|$|E
40|$|This report {{covers the}} {{conclusion}} of a multi-year project that examined the oxidation resistance of Al-rich coatings and a new project examining the effect of higher CO 2 contents on corrosion mechanisms in oxyfired coal-fueled boilers. The coating work primarily examined diffusion coatings for the steam side of typical ferritic (9 - 12 %Cr) and austenitic (e. g., Type 304 L) tube materials in accelerated testing at 650 °- 800 °C in wet air. The final phase of this work has attempted to obtain additional coating failures to determine a critical Al content (at coating failure) as a function of exposure temperature. However, no failures have been observed for <b>austenitic</b> <b>substrates</b> including> 25 kh at 700 °C and> 6 kh at 800 °C. Preliminary results are presented from the oxy-firing project, where the initial focus is on ferritic alloys. Initial coal-ash experiments were conducted at 600 °C to evaluate some of the test parameters and three different levels of CO 2 were investigated. An in-situ creep rig is being constructed to evaluate the effect of environment on creep properties. Initial ex-situ creep experiments are presented as a baseline...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Cr/CrN multilayers with a bilayer period λ = 62 ÷ 1000 nm, were investigated. They were {{deposited}} by PLD technique on austenitic and ferritic {{stainless steel}} substrates. Coating hardness and adhesion to substrates were measured by nanoindentation and scratch testing. Multilayer properties were compared with single Cr and CrN coatings. The 2 xCr/CrN and 4 xCr/CrN multilayers exhibited hardness slightly lower than the hardness of a single CrN coating, while the critical load of the 4 xCr/CrN multilayer, measured in the scratch test, was two times higher than for CrN. Furthermore, the character of coating failure also indicates the higher fracture toughness of multilayers than ceramic ones. The highest scratch resistance of the hardest multilayer with a bilayer period λ = 250 nm is extremely interesting. The measured values of the critical loads LC 1 and LC 2 of all coatings were higher for harder ferritic than <b>austenitic</b> <b>substrates.</b> However, analysis of scratch track geometry indicated that coating failure occurred under the same deformation of the coating-substrate system, while the higher values of critical load for coatings on ferrite derived from the higher hardness of the substrate. 1.

40|$|One of the {{critical}} issues {{for the application of}} iron aluminide coatings is the loss of Al from the coating into the Fe-base substrate alloys which do not contain aluminum. The interdiffusion behavior between chemical vapor deposited (CVD) aluminide coatings and ferritic and <b>austenitic</b> <b>substrates</b> is being studied for times up to 10, 000 h in the temperature range of 500 - 800 C. Coatings were synthesized using a laboratory-scale CVD reactor on representative commercial ferritic (Fe- 9 Cr- 1 Mo) and austenitic (type 304 L stainless steel) alloys. The aluminide coatings on both alloys typically consisted of a relatively thin (20 - 25 {micro}m) Al-rich outer layer and a thicker (150 - 250 {micro}m) inner layer with less Al. The composition profiles before and after interdiffusion testing were measured by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The decrease of the Al content at the coating surface was not significant after extended diffusion times ({le} 5000 h) at temperatures {le} 700 C. More interdiffusion occurred at 800 C in coatings on both Fe- 9 Cr- 1 Mo and 304 L alloys. Particularly, a two-phase microstructure was formed in the outer coating layer on 304 L after interdiffusion of 2000 h at 800 C. The interdiffusion behavior also was simulated using a computer model COSIM (Coating Oxidation and Substrate Interdiffusion Model), which was originally developed for MCrAlY overlay coatings by NASA. Reasonable agreement was observed between the simulated and experimental composition profiles although more work is needed to confirm assumptions made in the model...|$|R
40|$|This {{multi-layer}} {{program has}} examined the oxidation resistance of Al-rich coatings made by chemical vapor deposition and pack cementation on ferritic-martensitic (e. g. T 91, Fe- 9 Cr- 1 Mo) and austenitic (Type 304 L, Fe- 18 Cr- 8 Ni) substrates at 650 °- 800 °C. The main goal of this work was to demonstrate the potential benefits and problems with alumina-forming coatings. To evaluate their performance, oxidation exposures were conducted in a humid air environment where the uncoated substrates experience rapid oxidation, similar to steam. Exposure temperatures were increased to accelerate failure by oxidation and interdiffusion of Al into the substrate. The final results focused on thinner coatings with less Al and a ferritic Fe(Al) structure which have a lower thermal expansion than intermetallic phases. To improve the previously developed coating lifetime model, a final series of exposures were conducted {{to determine the effect}} of substrate composition (e. g. Cr content using Fe- 12 Cr and Fe- 9 Cr- 2 W substrates) and exposure temperature on the critical Al content for coating failure. For the coated Fe-(9 - 12) Cr specimens, there was little effect of Cr on lifetime at 800 °C. At 700 ° and 800 °C, thin coated austenitic specimens (304 L and 316) continue to be protective at up to double the lifetime of a similar coating on T 91. This increase could be attributed to the higher Cr content or the slower interdiffusion in <b>austenitic</b> <b>substrates</b> which is illustrated with electron microprobe measurements from thicker coatings stopped after 10 - 20 kh...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSelf-forming, vertically-aligned, {{arrays of}} black-body-like ZnO moth-eye {{nanostructures}} were grown on Si(111), c-Al 2 O 3, ZnO and high manganese <b>austenitic</b> steel <b>substrates</b> using Pulsed Laser Deposition. X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed the nanostructures to be well-crystallised wurtzite ZnO with strong preferential c-axis crystallographic orientation along the growth direction {{for all the}} substrates. Cathodoluminescence (CL) studies revealed emission characteristic of the ZnO near band edge for all substrates. Such moth-eye nanostructures have a graded effective refractive index and exhibit black-body characteristics. Coatings with these features may offer improvements in photovoltaic and LED performance. Moreover, since ZnO nanostructures can be grown readily {{on a wide range}} of substrates it is suggested that such an approach could facilitate growth of GaN-based devices on mismatched and/or technologically important substrates, which may have been inaccessible till present...|$|R

The chemical composition and microstructure of these coatings were characterized by atomic absorption spectroscopy, optical microscopy and scanningelectron microscopy. The microhardness of the coatings was measured and the wear mechanism of the coatings was examined using a pin-on-plate (reciprocating) wear testing machine. The results showed less cracking and pore development for Stellite 6 coatings applied to the martensitic stainless steel (SS) substrate. The wear test {{results showed that the}} weight loss for the coating on martensitic SS was significantly lower than for the <b>austenitic</b> SS <b>substrate.</b> It is concluded that the higher hardness of the coating on the martensitic SS, together with the harder and more rigid substrate increase the wear resistance of the Stellite 6 coating...|$|R
40|$|Duplex {{coatings}} combining {{a physical}} vapour deposition (PVD) thin film and laser-clad WC/Ni layer were produced on an <b>austenitic</b> steel <b>substrate.</b> PVD TiN, TiCN and TiC thin films were deposited using a filtered arc deposition system. Laser-clad WC/Ni layers were produced using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser and optical fibres. Mechanical properties (microhardness and adhesion) of the coatings were determined using a Ultra-Micro Indentation System (UMIS- 2000) and adhesion scratch tester, respectively. The wear resistance of the duplex coatings was evaluated by a pin-on-disc wear tester. The results showed that increasing the concentration of carbon in the PVD thin films increases its hardness, reduces its adhesion to the clad layer and increases its wear resistance. All coatings withstood the applied loads (25 and 40 N) and no sign of breakthrough was observed on any of them. This indicated that the duplex coatings exhibited {{a significant increase in}} load-bearing capacity, confirming the pivotal role of the laser-clad layer in supporting the applied load...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to develop a Fe-based metal matrix {{composite}} (MMC) coating using high velocity oxy-fuel spraying (HVOF) process. A ledeburitic high alloyed cold work tool steel (X 220 CrVMo 13 - 4) and NbC with an average size of 2 mu m at different volume fractions have been considered as metal matrix and hard particles respectively. MMC coatings were deposited on <b>austenitic</b> stainless <b>substrates</b> and the coatings were subsequently densified by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) with and without encapsulation. Microstructural analysis of the as-sprayed and HIPed coatings were characterized by SEM and XRD methods. Results showed that the feedstock preparation involving fine NbC was an influencing factor on the coating deposition. A relatively homogeneous dispersion of fine NbC up to 30 vol. % in cold work tool steel matrix was possible using optimized HVOF spraying. Besides, HVOF spraying and its subsequent HIP treatment induced significant microstructural and phase changes in the MMC coatings. The study showed the potential of HVOF spraying for the development of steel based MMC coatings and its subsequent densification can be achieved by HIP process with and without encapsulation.

40|$|The main aim of {{the studies}} was the {{deposition}} of the AlCrN film, covered by molybdenum disulphide (MoS 2) – based lubricant, on the <b>austenitic</b> steel <b>substrate.</b> The AlCrN and MoS 2 layers were deposited by PVD lateral rotating ARC-cathodes (LARC) and magnetron sputtering technology on the X 6 CrNiMoTi 17 - 12 - 2 respectively. Structural characterizations of the MoS 2 thin films {{have been carried out}} using SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and AFM (atomic force microscopy) to determine the surface topography as well as HRTEM (high-resolution transmission electron microscopy) and Raman spectroscopy for structural investigations. The tribological wear relationships using ball-on-disc test were specified for surface layers, determining the friction co-efficient and mass loss of the investigated surfaces. Tests of the coatings’ adhesion to the substrate material were made using the scratch test. HRTEM investigation shows an amorphous character of the MoS 2 layer. In sliding dry friction conditions, the friction co-efficient for the investigated elements is set in the range between 0. 4 - 0. 5. The investigated coating reveals high wear resistance. The coating demonstrated a dense cross-sectional morphology as well as good adhesion to the substrate. The good properties of the PVD AlCrN+MoS 2 coatings make them suitable in various engineering and industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{orientation}} imaging microscopy (OIM), based on electron backscatter diffraction in scanning electron microscopy, {{was employed to}} examine in detail the relationship between laser cladding processing parameters and he properties and the microstructure of single and overlapping laser tracks. The study was performed on thick (~ 1 mm) Co-based coatings prepared by 2 kW Nd:YAG laser cladding a 42 CrMo 4 steel substrate using different laser beam scanning speeds (1. 0 – 15 mm s– 1). It was found that the directional growth of individual primary grains {{led to the formation of}} a typical solidification fiber texture. The dependence of this texture on the processing speed and the shape of the solidification front were investigated in detail. Strong epitaxial growth of Co grains on <b>austenitic</b> steel <b>substrate</b> grains was found, which did not depend on the laser beam scanning velocity. During laser cladding a strong temperature gradient exists just below the coating–substrate interface that promotes the formation of a Greninger–Troiano orientation relationship between martensitic plates and the original austenitic grain inside the heat affected zone: { 1 1 1 }γ ≈ 1 ° to { 1 1 0 }α and γ ≈ 2 ° to α. Relatively drastic changes in grain size at the internal coating interfaces did not exhibit sharp changes in microhardness. ...|$|R

Sliding tests were conducted under self mated condition at room temperature and 550 °C using a pin-on disc type apparatus. The wear loss of the aged coating was found to be higher than that of the as deposited coating. The coarse grained structure with carbide (Cr 23 C 6) precipitation in the aged coating would account for the higher sliding wear loss.

The cellular density and morphometric analyses revealed that the optimal electric (E) fields for the maximum cell density of adhered L 929 (similar to 270 % to that of untreated sample) and SaOS 2 (similar to 280 % to that of untreated sample) cells are 1 V (0. 33 V/cm) and 2 V (0. 67 V/cm), respectively. The trend in aspect ratio of elongated SaOS 2 cells did not indicate any significant difference among the untreated and treated (up to 3. 33 V/cm) cells. The average cell and nucleus areas (for SaOS 2 cells) were increased with an increase in the applied voltage up to 8 V (2. 67 V/cm) and reduced thereafter. However, the ratio of nucleus to total cell area was increased significantly on the application of higher voltages (2 - 10 V), indicating the possible influence of E-field on cell growth. Further, the cell density results were compared with earlier results obtained with sintered Hydroxyapatite (HA) and HA-BaTiO 3 composites and such comparison revealed that the enhanced cell density on steel sample occurs upon application of much lower field strength and stimulation time. This indicates the possible role of substrate conductivity towards cell growth in pulsed E-field mediated culture conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} tune {{friction}} by tailoring surface topographies at micron length scales and {{by changing the}} relative orientation of crystallites at the atomic scale is well established. Here, we investigate if the two concepts combine, i. e. if the relative orientation of surfaces affects dry friction between laser-textured surfaces. Laser patterning was used on <b>austenitic</b> stainless steel <b>substrates</b> and on tribometer testing balls made of 100 Cr 6 to create linear periodic arrays with different structural wavelengths or periodicities (5, 9 and 18 μm). Pairing each substrate with a ball of the same periodicity, the different arrays were subjected to dry sliding tests at 0 °/ 90 ° relative alignment between the linear patters. We observe that the patterning reduces friction after running-in. The reduction increases with decreasing wavelength and also depends sensitively on the relative alignment and the chemistry of the sliding surfaces. Our results highlight the possibility to create tailored contacting surface geometries leading to tunable frictional properties...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{cleanliness}} is one {{the critical}} process variables in vacuum furnace brazing operations. For {{a large number}} of metallic components, cleaning is usually accomplished either by water-based alkali cleaning, but may also involve acid etching or solvent cleaning / rinsing. Nickel plating may also be necessary to ensure proper wetting. All of these cleaning or plating technologies have associated waste disposal issues, and this article explores an alternative cleaning process that generates minimal waste. Cathodic arc, or reserve polarity, is well known for welding of materials with tenacious oxide layers such as aluminum alloys. In this work the reverse polarity effect is used to clean <b>austenitic</b> stainless steel <b>substrates</b> prior to brazing with Ag- 28 %Cu. This cleaning process is compared to acid pickling and is shown to produce similar wetting behavior as measured by dynamic contact angle experiments. Additionally, dynamic contact angle measurements with water drops are conducted to show that cathodic arc cleaning can remove organic contaminants as well. The process does have its limitations however, and alloys with high titanium and aluminum content such as nickel-based superalloys may still require plating to ensure adequate wetting...|$|R
40|$|Growth {{texture and}} {{residual}} stress in TiN thin films on {{304 stainless steel}} were studied by XRD in parallel beam configuration. The high residual stress deeply influenced texture determination by conventional methods based on pole figures. Area maps (collections of 8 - 28 patterns at regular steps of v-tilting) were used to properly assess the mixed [21 l]/[l 1 l] growth mechanism in the nitride thin film, and for a detailed study of the residual stress analysis within the coating and outer layers of the substrate. The residual stress trend in the TiN thin film was studied considering data from (111) and (200) reflections, {{in order to avoid}} the effects of the fibre texture on the mechanical anisotropy. In particular, a residual stress gradient of the in-plane stress component was obtained for the thin film, whereas average in-plane stresses were calculated for the Martensitic layer at the thin film- substrate interface and for the outer layers of the <b>substrate</b> <b>Austenitic</b> phase underneath. It was also proposed that the use of Area Maps can be extended to study thickness and layer sequences, as well as microstrain and domain size effects connected with profile width and shape, in order to provide a detailed picture of thin film and interface features...|$|R

Scanning electron microscopy analysis of various indented regions on the diamond-coated steel and molybdenum samples in combination with the measurement of the acoustic emission signals during loading, indicate that the adhesion of the coatings on the stainless steel substrates with the CrN interlayer is comparable and only slightly less than that of the strongly adhering diamond films on the molybdenum samples. The critical load value derived from the acoustic emission signals at which partial delammation of the diamond films is first observed, is significantly lower for the diamond-coated steel with the boride interlayer than that obtained with the CrN interlayer for the present deposition conditions used. The steel {{ball indentation}} tests also show that the hardness and thickness of the interlayer have a strong effect on the penetration depths of the indents.

In order to address this issue, model coatings are being fabricated using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD process on ferritic (Fe- 9 Cr- 1 Mo) and <b>austenitic</b> (304 L) <b>substrates.</b> The performance of both high and low Al activity CVD processes is being characterized. The thicker coating produced by the high Al activity process is more resistant to a sulfidizing environment due to its higher Al content.

Diffusion and corrosion tests are being conducted to quantify the rate of Al loss from the coating. The remaining data needed to develop a coating lifetime model is the minimum Al content needed for the coating to be protective as a function of application temperature and environment. This failure criteria is being investigated using cast Fe-Al alloys with low Al contents (10 - 20 at. %) at test temperatures of 700 °- 1200 °C.

The cohesion and adhesion properties of the coatings were made using the scratch test on the CSEM REVETEST device. Findings: It was found that the coatings present a compact structure, without any visible delaminations or defects. The morphology of the fracture of coatings is characterized by a dense structure, in some cases there is a columnar structure. The coatings demonstrated good adhesion to the substrate.

40|$|This work {{is aimed}} at {{developing}} a surface engineering solution for applications requiring resistance to both abrasive and adhesive wear. The central plank of this work was to deposit and characterise duplex coatings by applying thin, hard films of titanium carbo-nitrides on a pre-clad metal matrix composite (MMC) coating of tungsten carbide in nickel matrix formed by a laser cladding process. In the first tranche of the project pulsed laser cladding of WC/Ni MMC with a Nd:YAG laser and optical fibres was investigated {{with the aim of}} producing a clad layer with minimum porosity, crack and dilution but with a sound metallurgical bond to the tool steel and stainless steel substrates. Thorough microstructural (XRD, optical and electron microscopy), mechanical (hardness) and abrasive wear characterization of the clad layers enabled optimisation of laser beam parameters, type and composition of powders and substrate preparation. It was established that WC/Ni MMC prepared from injected crushed powder can substantially improve the abrasive wear resistance of the substrate, almost by a factor of 10. In the second tranche of the project a ftltered arc deposition system was utilised to deposit hard coatings of titanium nitride, carbo-nitrides and carbide. Controlled variation of the partial pressure of reactive gases (nitrogen and methane) by mass flow controllers monitored by a mass spectrometer allowed deposition of adherent, macroparticle-free fllms with any desired carbon to nitrogen ratio, on <b>austenitic</b> stainless steel <b>substrates.</b> The mechanical properties (microhardness and adhesion) of the coatings were determined using an Ultra-Micro Indentation System (UMIS- 2000) and adhesion scratch tester, respectively.
