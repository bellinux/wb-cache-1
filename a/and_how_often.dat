Regular options include starting health, whether the worms can move, how long a turn lasts, and sudden death options. Weapons settings include what weapons the teams start with, which weapons will fall in crates <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>often,</b> and how powerful individual weapons are. Worms Armageddon offers several levels of customizability outside of direct gameplay options.|$|E

A case study of a 3-year-old girl with cerebral palsy revealed that intensive, systematic training involving the client, family members, therapists, and educational teams can {{make it possible to}} achieve marked progress in early language skills while learning and using a Minspeak device.

25|$|Web {{crawlers}} typically {{identify themselves}} to a Web server by using the User-agent field of an HTTP request. Web site administrators typically examine their Web servers' log and use the user agent field to determine which crawlers have visited the web server <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>often.</b> The user agent field may include a URL where the Web site administrator may find out {{more information about the}} crawler. Examining Web server log is tedious task, and therefore some administrators use tools to identify, track and verify Web crawlers. Spambots and other malicious Web crawlers are unlikely to place identifying information in the user agent field, or they may mask their identity as a browser or other well-known crawler.|$|E
25|$|A {{secondary}} {{analysis of}} a series of surveys conducted for the AAUW and administered to a representative sample of 2,064 8th through 11th-grade American students in 2000 showed that 9.6% of the students reported educator sex abuse. The students were asked if <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>often</b> they had experienced 14 types of behaviors which constitute sexual harassment. They then indicated who harassed them (students, teachers, school employees). Nonphysical sexual abuse (e.g., making sexual jokes) was more prevalent than physical abuse (8.7 and 6.7%). Girls {{were more likely to report}} educator sexual harassment than boys (10.3 and 8.8%). 12.3% of black, 12.2% of Latino, 8.4% of white and 1,8 % of Asian students indicated that they had experienced sexual harassment by teachers.|$|E

25|$|In cricket, a player's {{batting average}} {{is the total}} number of runs they have scored divided by the number of times they have been out. Since the number of runs a player scores <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>often</b> they get out are {{primarily}} measures of their own playing ability, and largely independent of their teammates, batting average is a good metric for an individual player's skill as a batsman. The number is also simple to interpret intuitively. If all the batsman's innings were completed (i.e. they were out every innings), this is the average number of runs they score per innings. If they did not complete all their innings (i.e. some innings they finished not out), this number is an estimate of the unknown average number of runs they score per innings. Batting average has been used to gauge cricket players' relative skills since the 18th century.|$|E
500|$|The film also {{explored}} Bird's {{dislike for}} {{the tendency of}} the children's comics and Saturday morning cartoons of his youth to portray villains as unrealistic, ineffectual, and non-threatening. In the film, Dash and Violet {{have to deal with}} villains who are perfectly willing to use deadly force against children. On another level, both Dash and Violet display no emotion or regret at the deaths of those who are trying to kill them, such as when Dash outruns pursuers who crash their vehicles while chasing him, or when both of them witness their parents destroy several attacking vehicles with people inside, in such a manner that the deaths of those piloting them is undeniable. Despite disagreeing with some analysis, Bird felt it gratifying for his work to be considered on many different levels, which was his intention: [...] "The fact that it was written about in the op/ed section of The New York Times several times was really gratifying to me.

2500|$|The {{first is}} the [...] "children in abundance" [...] group. Protestants within this group believe that birth control is a {{contravention}} of God’s purpose for marriage and that all children conceived during routine sexual intercourse (without regard to time of the month during the ovulation cycle or other matters) should be welcomed as blessings. The Quiverfull movement and its authors such as Mary Pride, Rick and Jan Hess, Charles D. Provan, Nancy Leigh DeMoss, Rachel Giove Scott, and others, predominate this group.

2500|$|The ranking is {{empirical}} and compiles {{a methodology}} that employs 10 different metrics. The criteria focused on academic papers, which indicate basic research performed at a university, and patent filings, which {{point to an}} institution's interest in protecting and commercializing its discoveries. Compiled by the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters, the list uses proprietary data and analysis tools. The process began by identifying the 500 academic and government organizations that published {{the greatest number of}} articles in scholarly journals, as indexed in the Thomson Reuters Web of Science Core Collection database. The list was cross referenced against the number of patents filed by each organization during the same time period in the Derwent World Patents Index and the Derwent Innovations Index. Patent equivalents, citing patents and citing articles were included. The timeframe allows for the articles and patent activity to receive citations, thereby contributing to that portion of the methodology. The list was reduced to just those institutions that filed 70 or more patents, the bulk of which were universities. Each candidate university was then evaluated using various indicators including how often a university's patent applications were granted; how many patents were filed with global patent offices and local authorities; <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>often</b> the university's patents were cited by others. Universities were also evaluated in terms of how often their research papers were cited by patents; and the percentage of articles that featured a co-author from industry.
