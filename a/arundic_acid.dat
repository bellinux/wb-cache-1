40|$|Stroke-prone spontaneously {{hypertensive}} rats (SHRSP) {{used as a}} {{model of}} essential hypertension cause a high incidence of brain stroke on the course of hypertension. Incidences and sizes of brain lesions are known to relate to the astrocyte activities. Therefore, relation between brain damage and the expression profile of the astrocytes was investigated with morphometric and immunohistochemical analyses using astrocyte marker antibodies of S 100 B and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) with or without <b>arundic</b> <b>acid</b> administration, a suppressor on the activation of astrocytes. <b>Arundic</b> <b>acid</b> extended the average life span of SHRSP. An increase in brain tissue weight was inhibited concomitant with a lower rate of gliosis/hemosiderin deposit/scarring in brain lesions. S 100 B- or GFAP-positive dot and filamentous structures were decreased in arundic acid-treated SHRSP, and this effect was most pronounced in the cerebral cortex, white matter, and pons, and less so in the hippocampus, diencephalon, midbrain, and cerebellum. Blood pressure decreased after administration of <b>arundic</b> <b>acid</b> in the high-dose group (100  mg/kg/day <b>arundic</b> <b>acid),</b> but not in the low-dose group (30  mg/kg/day). These data indicate that <b>arundic</b> <b>acid</b> can prevent hypertension-induced stroke, and may inhibit the enlargement of the stroke lesion by preventing the inflammatory changes caused by overproduction of the S 100 B protein in the astrocytes...|$|E
40|$|S 100 B is {{expressed}} in various types of glial cells and is involved in regulating many aspects of their function. However, {{little is known about}} its role during nervous system development. In this study, we investigated the effect of inhibiting the onset of S 100 B synthesis {{in the development of the}} enteric nervous system, a network of neurons and glia located in the wall of the gut that is vital for control of gastrointestinal function. Intact gut explants were taken from embryonic day (E) 13. 5 mice, the day before the first immunohistochemical detection of S 100 B, and cultured in the presence of <b>arundic</b> <b>acid,</b> an inhibitor of S 100 B synthesis, for 48 h. The effects on Sox 10 -immunoreactive enteric neural crest progenitors and Hu-immunoreactive enteric neurons were then analyzed. Culture in <b>arundic</b> <b>acid</b> reduced the proportion of Sox 10 + cells and decreased cell proliferation. There was no change in the density of Hu+ enteric neurons, however, a small population of cells exhibited atypical co-expression of both Sox 10 and Hu, which was not observed in control cultures. Addition of exogenous S 100 B to the cultures did not change Sox 10 + cell numbers. Overall, our data suggest that cell-intrinsic intracellular S 100 B is important for maintaining Sox 10 and proliferation of the developing enteric glial lineage. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Like microglia, {{reactive}} astrocytes {{produce a}} myriad of neuro-toxic substances in various brain pathologies, such as Alzhei-mer’s disease (AD), trauma, and cerebral ischemia. Among the numerous products of reactive astrocytes, attention has re-cently been directed toward the possible detrimental role of S 100 B, because the protein {{has been shown to}} be highly expressed along with the progression of brain damage and to exert neurotoxic effects at high concentrations. The present study aimed to examine the possible role of astrocyte-derived S 100 B in the progression of cerebral amyloidosis and gliosis in transgenic mice overproducing mutant amyloid precursor pro-tein (Tg APPsw mice, line 2576). For this purpose, <b>arundic</b> <b>acid</b> (Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Mishima, Osaka, Japan), which is known to negatively regulate astrocyte synthesis of S 100 B...|$|E
40|$|Increases in the T(1) {{of brain}} tissue, which {{give rise to}} dark or hypointense areas on T(1) -weighted images using {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI), are common {{to a number of}} neuropathologies including multiple sclerosis (MS) and ischaemia. However, the biologic significance of T(1) increases remains unclear. Using a multiparametric MRI approach and well-defined experimental models, we have experimentally induced increases in tissue T(1) to determine the underlying cellular basis of such changes. We have shown that a rapid acute increase in T(1) relaxation in the brain occurs in experimental models of both low-flow ischaemia induced by intrastriatal injection of endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), and excitotoxicity induced by intrastriatal injection of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). However, {{there appears to be no}} consistent correlation between increases in T(1) relaxation and changes in other MRI parameters (apparent diffusion coefficient, T(2) relaxation, or magnetisation transfer ratio of tissue water). Immunohistochemically, one common morphologic feature shared by the ET- 1 and NMDA models is acute astrocyte activation, which was detectable within 2 h of intracerebral ET- 1 injection. Pretreatment with an inhibitor of astrocyte activation, <b>arundic</b> <b>acid,</b> significantly reduced the spatial extent of the T(1) signal change induced by intrastriatal ET- 1 injection. These findings suggest that an increase in T(1) relaxation may identify the acute development of reactive astrocytes within a central nervous system lesion. Early changes in T(1) may, therefore, provide insight into acute and reversible injury processes in neurologic patients, such as those observed before contrast enhancement in MS...|$|E
