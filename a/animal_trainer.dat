5|$|Howard Peck, an <b>animal</b> <b>trainer,</b> {{brought the}} eight-month-old collie to Hollywood <b>animal</b> <b>trainer</b> Rudd Weatherwax {{in order to}} break the animal of {{uncontrolled}} barking and a habit of chasing motorcycles. After working with the dog, Weatherwax gained control of the barking {{but was unable to}} break Pal of his motorcycle-chasing habit. Peck was disappointed with the results and gave the dog to Weatherwax in exchange for the money Peck owed him. Weatherwax, in turn, gave the dog to a friend, but when he learned that Eric Knight's 1940 novel, Lassie Come-Home, was being considered as a feature film by MGM, Weatherwax sensed Pal was the dog to fill the role, and bought Pal back from his friend for $10.00 USD. Peck later tried to reclaim him after he became famous as Lassie, but Weatherwax's legal ownership was upheld. Rudd's brother Frank Weatherwax, who trained dogs for such films as The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T and The Wizard of Oz, assisted Rudd in training Pal.|$|E

500|$|Earlier <b>animal</b> <b>trainers</b> had {{historically}} relied {{primarily on}} punishment when teaching animals. The Brelands instead followed Skinner's {{emphasis on the}} use of positive reinforcement to train animals, using rewards for desired behavior. Although other students of Skinner's later entered commercial animal training as well, the Brelands' techniques dominated the field because they found ways to simplify the training of complex behaviors. The Brelands did not just train the animals. They also trained other <b>animal</b> <b>trainers,</b> establishing in 1947 [...] "the first school and instruction manual for teaching <b>animal</b> <b>trainers</b> the applied technology of behavior analysis." [...] Marlin Perkins of Wild Kingdom and Walt Disney were among those who learned from them.|$|R

25|$|In 1968, {{with the}} craft of clowning {{seemingly}} neglected and {{with many of the}} clowns in their 50s, he established the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Clown College. A circus in Europe was purchased for $2 million just to have its star <b>animal</b> <b>trainer,</b> Gunther Gebel-Williams, for the core of his revamped circus. Soon, he split the show into two touring units, Red and Blue, which could tour the country independently. The separate tours could also offer differing slates of acts and themes, enabling circus goers to view both tours where possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{involvement of}} animals in circus was just the display of exotic creatures in a menagerie. Going {{as far back as}} the early eighteenth century, exotic animals were transported to North America for display, and menageries were a popular form of entertainment. The first true animals acts in the circus were equestrian acts. Soon elephants and big cats were displayed as well. Isaac A. Van Amburgh entered a cage with several big cats in 1833, and is generally considered to be the first wild <b>animal</b> <b>trainer</b> in American circus history. Mabel Stark was a famous female tiger-tamer.|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} for [...] "Birthday" [...] {{was directed by}} Marc Klasfeld and Danny Lockwood; Dawn Rose served as a producer, while Nicole Acacio served as executive producer, Richard Alarcon sereved as the editor, Tony Gardner as the make-up artist, and Joseph Robbins {{was the director of}} photography. For the video, which was filmed in April 2014, Perry played the characters of five party entertainers, appearing in five parties. They consisted of a burlesque-like elderly woman named Goldie, a Jewish master of ceremonies named Yosef Shulem, a clown named Kriss, an <b>animal</b> <b>trainer</b> named Ace, and a face-painter named Princess Mandee. In order to transform Perry physically to each character, she spent up to seven hours getting prosthetic makeup applied by Tony Gardner.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} begins with short {{introductions}} to the characters Goldie, Yosef, Kriss, Ace, and Mandee. Perry is then shown entering {{all of the}} parties as [...] "five of the world’s worst birthday entertainers" [...] in disguise. At a man's 90th birthday, Goldie emerges from a large birthday cake and begins to give the man a lap dance. At a child's birthday party, Kriss the Clown attempts to create balloon animals, while Ace the <b>Animal</b> <b>Trainer</b> introduces {{a group of children}} to a box of mice before appearing to eat one, which makes a child cry. At another child's party, Princess Mandee paints a girl's face incompetently; Goldie begins to suffer from respiratory problems, and Yosef does the worm at a boy's Bar Mitzvah. Goldie pulls a man's prosthetic leg off and proceeds to play air guitar with it, and Kriss crashes into a table before drinking alcohol behind a tree.|$|E

[...] Cast and crew members later recalled that Manners began giving orders to the roaches. Cinematographer John Bartley explained, [...] "when I saw Kim Manners talking to a bucket of cockroaches, that was a highlight for me." [...] Several [...] "incredibly detailed" [...] rubber cockroaches were created for the episode. These props were extremely detailed: prop master Ken Hawryliw explained that, [...] "you could put one next to a real roach and no one would know the difference."

500|$|Pal (June 4, 1940– June 1958) was a Rough Collie {{performer}} {{and the first}} in a line of such dogs to portray the fictional female collie Lassie in film and television.

Following his film debut, Pal starred in six more MGM Lassie films from the mid-1940s to early 1950s, then appeared briefly in shows, fairs, and rodeos around the United States before starring in the two pilots filmed in 1954 for the television series, Lassie. Pal retired after filming the television pilots, and died in June 1958. [...] He sired a line of descendants who continued to play the fictional character he originated.
