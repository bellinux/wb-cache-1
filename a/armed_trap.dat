50|$|This armlock is {{executed}} with Uke {{on their}} stomach, while tori has uke's <b>arm</b> <b>trapped</b> with the elbow beneath tori's armpit. Tori lifts uke's hand, causing hyperextension of the elbow joint {{in a similar}} manner to Ude-Hishigi-Juji-Gatame.|$|R
50|$|The Gannosuke Clutch has an attacking wrestler {{facing the}} opponent, {{grabbing}} their arm, twisting {{it into a}} modified hammerlock and then performing a front somersault while holding the <b>trapped</b> <b>arm</b> in place as well as legsweeping the opponent's near leg, rolling the opponent backwards while the attacking wrestler keeps the hammerlock applied while also holding the opponent's near leg down with their own leg. This move {{is also known as}} an <b>arm</b> <b>trap</b> somersault cradle.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the precise}} {{mechanism}} of injury is unclear, the injury occurs in children who have fallen heavily with their <b>arm</b> <b>trapped</b> under the body. In his original description of the injury, Hume suggested that the injury occurred {{as a result of}} hyperextension of the elbow leading to fracture of the olecranon, with pronation of the forearm leading to the radial head dislocation.|$|R
40|$|It {{was rather}} serendipitous, not that I broke my wrist, but that I chose to bring Anna De Fina and Alexandra Georgakopoulou 2 ̆ 7 s 2012 book, Analyzing Narrative: Discourse and Sociolinguistic Perspectives, to my {{physical}} therapy appointments. Three {{times a week}} for several weeks, I read left-handed with my right <b>arm</b> <b>trapped</b> in a device that radiated extreme heat or numbing cold. I encourage anyone with an interest in narrative analysis to read this book, especially, if possible, in the company of people with stories to tell (but minus the temperature variations). There are six chapters and I recommend that it be read in thirds...|$|R
50|$|It was {{presented}} to Ciriaco Mattei in 1582 by the Senate of Rome {{and moved to the}} park in 1587 as the centrepiece of the villa's theatre. Manuel de Godoy had the obelisk moved to its present position {{at the end of the}} central route by the Spanish architect Antonio Celles in 1817. It was on this occasion that it was placed on its present 16th century base, consisting of 4 lions. In the works a support broke and worker had his hand and part of his <b>arm</b> <b>trapped</b> under the obelisk (where they still remain) - they had to be removed in an emergency amputation.|$|R
50|$|The attacking wrestler stands {{facing the}} {{opponent}}, then puts {{one of their}} arms across the opponents chest holding their shoulder, the attacking wrestler then sweeps {{the legs of the}} opponent in the fashion of an STO, but brings their knee forward so the opponent falls back first on to it. There is also an <b>arm</b> <b>trap</b> version that sees an attacking wrestler take hold of an arm of an opponent and then move to a slightly front to back position, so that the opponent's arm hooks across and round the opponent's own head. At this point, the attacking wrestler kneels forward to the ground, forcing the opponent's own arm to drag them to the attacker's exposed knee.|$|R
50|$|A {{sanitary}} tee has {{a curved}} center section. In drainage systems, {{it is primarily}} used to connect horizontal drains (including fixture <b>trap</b> <b>arms)</b> to vertical drains. The center connection is generally to the pipe leading to a <b>trap</b> (the <b>trap</b> <b>arm).</b> It must not connect a vertical drain to a horizontal drain, because of the likelihood that solids will accumulate {{at the bottom of}} the junction and cause a blockage.|$|R
50|$|In the Ude-hishigi-ude-gatame arm lock, Tori executes an arm lock {{technique}} by hugging one of Uke’s {{arms against}} their chest. This is often {{in response to}} an escape attempt while trying to hold Uke down. Tori uses this technique specifically when Uke attempts to escape by extending an arm to grab Tori’s collar. Tori takes control of the extended arm with both hands and traps it to their chest. Tori draws Uke’s wrist {{to one side of the}} face and presses their knee against Uke’s side. With Uke then rolled onto one side with their <b>arm</b> <b>trapped</b> and their side locked, Tori employs the lever principle to hyperextend and bend Uke’s arm. While leaning back, Tori pulls Uke <b>trapped</b> <b>arm</b> toward his stomach to apply the elbow joint lock. Although it is possible to submit Uke if the technique is properly applied, there is a low percentage of finishing a match this manner. In actual competition, this technique is typically used as a transition to an Osaekomi-waza (pinning-hold technique).|$|R
50|$|In 2003, an Australian {{coal miner}} trapped three {{kilometres}} underground by an overturned tractor {{cut off his}} own arm with a box-cutting knife. The 44-year-old man, who was not identified by police, was working late at the Hunter Valley mine when the tractor tipped over, crushing his <b>arm</b> and <b>trapping</b> him.|$|R
50|$|Axel's left <b>arm</b> gets <b>trapped</b> under {{rocks in}} the cave-in at the end. He rips it off to get away, leaving his severed limb behind to horrify {{everybody}} else. But since the key footage of the arm removal all {{had to be removed}} itself, {{it is hard to see}} exactly what happened.|$|R
5000|$|In another {{flashback}} (first seen in [...] "The Left Hand," [...] {{just after}} the explosion, Bennett's <b>arm</b> is <b>trapped</b> under rubble. Caroline is unable to free Bennett. Caroline tells Bennett that she will turn herself in and that Bennett {{will be able to}} save herself by telling Rossum she was working late.|$|R
50|$|Harry, Rachel and the {{children}} move deeper into the mine for more protection {{to wait out the}} eruption. Harry realizes he forgot the beacon in the truck, but when he tries to go back and get it, a rock fall breaks his <b>arm</b> and <b>traps</b> him in the truck. However, he still manages to activate the beacon.|$|R
50|$|A low dam at {{the west}} end of the lake was {{originally}} built to maintain a dependable supply of fresh water for a pulp mill in Gardiner. The lake's shape is dendritic, and several of its branches have names. Starting at the dam, the named branches in a clockwise progression around the lake are Shag Arm, Deer Arm, Big Arm, Catfish Cove, North <b>Arm,</b> Bear <b>Trap</b> <b>Arm,</b> Spike Arm, Fivemile Arm, Dismal Swamp, Cleves Cove, Cherry Arm, Mallard Arm, Bombard Bay, Bedolf Arm, and Bass Arms. The lake's two named islands are Weed and Jewitt, both toward {{the west end of}} the lake. Toward the east end, Leitel Marsh extends about 2 mi beyond the lake, and Fivemile Marsh extends about twice as far.|$|R
5000|$|Benavidez faced Tim Elliott on April 26, 2014 at UFC 172. Benavidez won {{the fight}} {{in the first round}} via {{modified}} guillotine choke. Elliot was forced to tap with his feet as his <b>arms</b> were <b>trapped</b> by Benavidez's legs. Benavidez has called this submission the [...] "Joa Constrictor". The win also earned Benavidez his first Performance of the Night bonus award.|$|R
50|$|An armlock {{variation}} of the cloverleaf {{that is similar to}} a single leg Boston crab with armlock. This hold begins with a supine opponent lying face up on the mat. The attacking wrestler then seizes one of the arms and proceeds to walk over the opponent while continuing to hold the arm, forcing them to turn over onto their stomach. The wrestler then kneels down on the opponents back, locking the opponent's arm behind his knee in the process. The wrestler then reaches over and bends one leg so that the shin is behind the knee of the straight leg and places the ankle of the straight leg in their armpit. With the same arm, the wrestler reaches around the ankle and through the opening formed by the legs, and locks his hands together as in a cloverleaf. The wrestler then pulls back so as to stretch the legs, back and neck of the opponent while keeping the <b>arm</b> <b>trapped.</b>|$|R
50|$|Merle's USAC Champ Car racing {{career was}} brief and tragic. Three laps into his first Champ Car race on a paved track, Michigan International Speedway on July 16, 1972, he tangled with Mike Hiss {{and crashed into}} the outside wall. The car {{exploded}} in flames and Merle tried to climb out {{while it was still}} moving. His right <b>arm</b> became <b>trapped</b> between the car and the wall and was torn off.|$|R
25|$|The {{remaining}} commandos {{arrived at}} the scene and administered first aid to Djupdraet. His wound was so severe, they decided to leave him behind to get treatment. The remaining commandos now split into two groups to evade the German search parties and made their way further up the mountain. One group, consisting of Lance Sergeant O'Brien, Corporal Granlund, and Privates Fairclough and Trigg, went north around the mountains. The second group of Captains Black and Houghton, CSM Smith, Lance Bombardier Chudley, and Privates Curtis, Abram and Makeham, took the southern route. The second group were discovered by the Germans who opened fire, wounding Captain Houghton in the right <b>arm.</b> <b>Trapped</b> and surrounded {{they were forced to}} surrender. The O'Brien group split up into two smaller groups, Granlund setting off by himself. They all eventually reached Sweden without further incident and all four were repatriated by plane to RAF Leuchars. Of the other eight, Djupdraet died of his wounds in hospital, three days after the raid. The other seven prisoners of war were sent to Germany.|$|R
50|$|Alternately if moving sink to {{an island}} sink, install the P-trap below {{the floor of the}} island and vent {{off the top of the}} drain. Attach toward the trap and reverse 180 degrees so any water in the vent flows down the drain. Slope drain down, slope vent up, and attach to {{existing}} vent from previous existing fixture that is now abandoned. Patch previously existing drain to become vent. In Canada, the national plumbing code requires that the minimum <b>trap</b> <b>arm</b> be at least 2 times the pipe diameter, (e.g. 1.25 inch pipe needs a 2.5-inch <b>trap</b> <b>arm,</b> 1.5 pipe needs a 3-inch <b>trap</b> <b>arm</b> etc.) and that the vent pipe be one size larger than the drain that it serves, also a cleanout is required on both the vent and the drain. The reason for this is in the event of a plugged sink, the waste water will back up and go down the vent, possibly plugging the vent (as it is under the countertop), and a clean-out would permit the cleaning of the pipes.|$|R
50|$|Outraged, the juniors {{decide that}} it is now time for Prout to receive the same kind of {{treatment}} that the Secret Seven has previously reserved for Loder and his circle. That evening, as Prout enters his study and settles into his armchair, members of the Secret Seven emerge from various places of hiding. Before Prout is able to react, the open end of a coal sack is dragged over his head and drawn tight around him. His <b>arms</b> <b>trapped,</b> and unable to release himself, Prout staggers to the door and flounders along the passage to seek help. Astonished onlookers assume that a drunken coalman is playing a prank. Loder and the other prefects disdain from handling the filthy figure, but members of the Remove - possibly with some foreknowledge of who is really inside the sack - volunteer to barge the figure out of the school. It is only when the figure has been propelled as far as the school gates that Loder finally realises the truth and releases Prout.|$|R
