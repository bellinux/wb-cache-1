The loss of Helsinki pushed them to Petrograd on 25 April 1918 (Edvard Gylling alone stood by his warriors). The escape of the Red {{leadership}} imbittered the Red troopers. Thousands of them, without true leadership, tried {{to flee to}} Russia, but most the refugees were besieged by the White <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> troops.

5|$|The Battle of Arras (also {{known as}} the Second Battle of Arras) was a British {{offensive}} on the Western Front during World War I. From 9 April to 16 May 1917, British troops attacked German defences near the French city of Arras on the Western Front. The British achieved the longest advance since trench warfare had begun, surpassing the record set by the French Sixth Army on 1 July 1916. The British advance slowed {{in the next few}} days <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> defence recovered. The battle became a costly stalemate for both sides and by the end of the battle the British Third and First armies had suffered about 160,000 casualties <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> 6th Army 125,000 casualties.|$|E

5|$|Eichmann stated at {{his later}} interrogations that Heydrich told him in mid-September that Hitler had ordered that all Jews in German-controlled Europe {{were to be}} killed.

However, with the entry of the United States into the war in December <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> failure in the Battle of Moscow, Hitler decided that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. Around this time, Eichmann was promoted to SS-Obersturmbannführer (lieutenant colonel), the highest rank he achieved.|$|E

5|$|Germany {{had been}} de facto divided, and two {{independent}} states, the Federal Republic of Germany <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> Democratic Republic were created within {{the borders of}} Allied and Soviet occupation zones, accordingly. The rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet spheres of influence. Most eastern and central European countries fell into the Soviet sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Albania became Soviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the USSR.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, the Scottish naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes {{described}} Hawkins's rail, an {{extinct species}} of rail from the Chatham Islands, {{as a new}} species of Aphanapteryx; A. hawkinsi.

These ideas were later criticised by writers such as the British palaeontologist Charles William Andrews <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> ornithologist Hans Friedrich Gadow, and the bird was moved to its own genus, Diaphorapteryx.|$|E
