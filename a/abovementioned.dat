Annuario Pontificio, the annual official directory of the Holy See, in its edition {{for the year}} 2000, lists all the Catholic and or Pontifical institutes of higher learning, grouping them into two categories: Roman Ateneums and Catholic Universities. Only 24 are called Pontifical, and of these 24, six are located in Rome (Gregorian University, Lateran University, Urbanian University, University of Santo Tomas (known as The Angelicum), Salisian University and Holy Cross University); three are in Europe; fourteen in Latin America; and one in Asia, this one being the University of Santo Tomas of Manila. The oldest university to be denominated by the Holy See as Pontifical is the Jesuit Gregorian University in Rome. Although founded in 1551, it was Pope Pius IX who, in 1873, permitted the school to assume the title of ‘Pontifical University.’” All the other <b>abovementioned</b> 23 universities received the title of Pontifical in the 20th century. The University of Santo Tomas of Manila, the oldest of them, {{is second only to}} the Gregorian University to be declared Pontifical by the apostolic constitution Quae Mari Sinico in 1902.|$|E

25|$|By {{building}} on Wehrung's <b>abovementioned</b> work on dimension vector spaces, Ploščica and Tůma proved that WURP {{does not hold}} in G(Ω), for any set Ω of cardinality at least ℵ2. Hence G(Ω) does not satisfy Schmidt's Condition. It is to be noted that all negative representation results mentioned here always make use of some uniform refinement property, including the first one about dimension vector spaces.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scientists}} suggest patch grafts {{ought to}} be applied to irreparable rotator cuff tears. Though this practice lessens pain, muscle strength is not fully recovered. The <b>abovementioned</b> human rotator cuff study correlates pennation angle with tear length in the supraspinatus muscle. Therefore, a patch graft may not resolve the length change necessary to restore pennation angle; retraction of the torn tendon may lessen the post-tear pennation angle and restore muscle strength to a greater extent.|$|E
25|$|Therefore the {{inevitable}} rhythmic reliability in fastest, asymmetric accented, melodies {{is a special}} trademark of virtuosos. Generalizing: Arabian music is {{much more interested in}} rhythmical patterns that are more complex than European ones. Bashir's virtuosity of picking can easily be understood, when he shows his ability to apply the <b>abovementioned</b> scordatura, with its string pairs tuned in octaves, in an improvisation in the fast 10/8 metre, without the immense stopping problems of this method becoming hearable.|$|E
25|$|Of the <b>abovementioned</b> sources, 2,000 were {{concerned}} with Czechoslovakia (including Sudetenland). Of those, only a faction included reliable numbers of killed Germans adding to about 6,000 confirmed deaths. The report cites an estimate by Kurt W. Böhme (1965): Gesucht wird..., p.264, according to whom 350.000 Germans were interned in camps, about 100,000 of whom died. From the sources, the 1974 report says that the numbers of the interned {{are likely to be}} higher, and refers to another study by A. Bohmann (1959): Das Sudetendeutschtum in Zahlen, p.199, presenting an estimate of up to one million internees. The report further states that from Czechoslovakia, relatively few Germans were deportated to the USSR.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{demographic}} wave {{also occurred}} after 3000 BC from the steppe, postulated {{to be linked}} with the expansion of Indo-European languages. Bronze and Iron Age samples from Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, however, suggest that this impact was less significant in Southeastern Europe than areas north of the Carpathians. In fact, in the <b>abovementioned</b> studies, the Bronze and Iron Age Balkan samples do not cluster with modern Balkan groups, but lie between Sardinians and other southwestern European groups, suggesting later phenomena (i.e. in Antiquity, Great Migration Period) caused shifts in population genetic structure. However, aDNA samples from southeastern Europe remain few, and only further sampling will allow a clear and diachronic overview of migratory and demographic trends.|$|E
25|$|Crying and {{vegetative}} {{sounds are}} controlled by the brain stem, which matures earlier than the cortex. Neurological development of higher brain structures coincides with certain developments in infants’ vocalizations. For example, the onset of cooing at 6 to 8 weeks happens as {{some areas of the}} limbic system begin to function. The limbic system is known {{to be involved in the}} expression of emotion, and cooing in infants is associated with a feeling of contentedness. Further development of the limbic system might be responsible for the onset of laughter around 16 weeks of age. The motor cortex, finally, which develops later than the <b>abovementioned</b> structures may be necessary for canonical babbling, which start around 6 to 9 months of age.|$|E
25|$|The current heir-apparent of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Willem-Alexander (born 1967), Prince of Orange, descends paternally, {{through a}} female line, after 500 years, {{from each of}} the three {{above-mentioned}} Finnish families of Kurck. This is because one ancestress of Willem-Alexander has been countess Eva Horn (1653-1740), wife of Reichsgraf Nicholas Bielke, lord of the Finnish barony of Korpo, and daughter of the Finnish field marshal Gustav Horn (1592-1657), Count of Pori, the Lord High Constable of Sweden. The Horn counts of Pori, Finland descend, through the Porvoo-originated owners of the manor of Sydänmaa, from a daughter of the <b>abovementioned</b> lady Elin Klasdotter, heiress of the Kurck of Laukko, and her husband lawspeaker Knut Eriksson. Lady Elin, as explained above, descended from the medieval Kurck of Laukko family and from the Kurck of Niemenpää family (and was their heiress), and of course all her descendants so descend too.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} of the Safavid monarchs, Shah Abbas I the Great (1587–1629) {{came to power}} in 1587 aged 16. Abbas I first fought the Uzbeks, recapturing Herat and Mashhad in 1598, which had been lost by his predecessor Mohammad Khodabanda by the Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–1590). Then he turned against the Ottomans, the Safavids their archrivals, recapturing Baghdad, eastern Iraq and the Caucasian provinces and beyond by 1618. Between 1616–1618, following the disobedience of his most loyal Georgian subjects Teimuraz I and Luarsab II, Abbas carried out a punitive campaign in his territories of Georgia, devastating Kakheti and Tbilisi and carrying away 130,000 – 200,000 Georgian captives towards mainland Iran. His new army, which had dramatically been improved with the advent of Robert Shirley and his brothers following the first diplomatic mission to Europe, pitted the first crushing victory over the Safavids' archrivals, the Ottomans in the <b>abovementioned</b> 1603–1618 war and would surpass the Ottomans in military strength. He also used his new force to dislodge the Portuguese from Bahrain (1602) and Hormuz (1622) with aid of the English navy, in the Persian Gulf.|$|E

500|$|However, {{many critics}} were displeased with Minogue's lack of {{innovation}} on Aphrodite. Helen Clarke from MusicOMH gave the album an overall positive review and appreciated Minogue for [...] "just what she does, and somehow it works", but did mention that it [...] " [...] fails to quite hit the spot". Jon Parales from The New York Times found the album too {{similar to the}} work of Madonna, especially her studio albums Like a Virgin (1984) and Ray of Light (1998), and commented that [...] "No one's asking for reality in this (Minogue's) pop bubble — {{just a little bit more}} innovation". Kitty Empire from The Observer enjoyed the album and complimented Price for [...] "lending a sleek cohesion to the whole (album)", but opined that Aphrodite [...] " [...] lacks the depth and chutzpah of some of her rivals' efforts". Slant Magazine critic Sal Cinquemani noted it to be [...] "more stylistically coherent than the <b>abovementioned</b> albums" [...] and predicted that it would [...] "no doubt please longtime fans", but also criticized Price's shallow [...] "antiseptic" [...] production which he felt was not able to complement Minogue's voice.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} motif and [...] "casual {{approach}} to" [...] bisexual characters in his novels, continued in Imperial Bedrooms, Ellis stated he [...] "really [...] know", {{and that he}} wished he could provide [...] "an answer – depicting [...] as extremely conscious of those choices". He believes it to be an [...] "interesting aspect of [...] work". Details notes how Ellis' own sexuality, frequently described as bisexual, has been notoriously hard to pin down. Reviewers have long tried to probe Ellis on autobiographical themes in his work. He reiterates to Vice that he is not Clay. Ellis says that other contemporary authors (naming Michael Chabon, Jonathan Franzen, Jonathan Lethem as examples) don't get asked if their novels are autobiographical. (However, Ellis tells one interview, that he [...] "cannot fully" [...] say that [...] "I'm not Clay" [...] because of their emotional [...] "connections".) Vice attributes this streak to Ellis' age when Less Than Zero came out, which led to him being seen as a voice-of-the-generation. Ellis feels that the autobiographical truths of his novels lie in their writing processes, which to him are like emotional [...] "exorcisms". Crace's <b>abovementioned</b> parody suggests that Less Than Zero Clay was originally a flattering portrayal of Ellis. Ellis discusses lightly the kinds of self-insertion present in the book. While Clay is clearly (parodically) working on the film adaptation of The Informers, he {{is at the same time}} fully aware that he has been a character in Less Than Zero, and that ostensibly, Ellis is 'the author' whom Clay knew. However, there are clear differences to the characters, as well. For example, Ellis had to omit lines from the book he felt Clay would never have thought of, on subjects he would never have noticed. Ellis himself feels he is adapting to middle-age very well; Clay, however, isn't.|$|E

2500|$|Few of the {{analytical}} methods used prior to 2001 to measure levels of endogenously formed DMT had enough sensitivity and selectivity to produce reliable results.

2500|$|Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi wrote a Shulchan Aruch at {{the behest}} of the Hasidic leader, Rabbi Dovber of Mezeritch.

Rabbi Abraham Danzig [...] was the first in the Lithuanian Jewish community to attempt a summary of the opinions in the <b>abovementioned</b> works in his Chayei Adam and Chochmath Adam. Similar works are Ba'er Heitev and Sha'arei Teshuvah/Pitchei Teshuvah (usually published as commentaries in most editions of the Shulchan Aruch) as well as Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (by Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried of Hungary). Danzig's and Ganzfried's works do not follow the structure of the Shulchan Aruch, but given their single-voiced approach, are considered easier to follow for those with less background in halacha.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, the band's {{popularity}} {{was starting to}} decline. [...] Alan Gratzer left in September 1988 after he decided to retire from music to open a restaurant. In early 1989, Gary Richrath quit after tensions between him and Kevin Cronin boiled over. Cronin had been playing in The Strolling Dudes, a jazz ensemble that included jazz trumpet player Rick Braun (who had co-written the <b>abovementioned</b> [...] "Here With Me" [...] with Cronin), Miles Joseph on lead guitar and Graham Lear on drums. Lear had already been invited to join REO in September 1988 as Gratzer's successor and Joseph was brought in as a temporary stand-in for Richrath. Back up singers Carla Day and Melanie Jackson were also added. This lineup did only one show, on January 7, 1989 in Viña del Mar, Chile, where it won the award for best group at the city's annual International Song Festival. After that, Miles Joseph and the back up singers were dropped in favor of former Ted Nugent guitarist Dave Amato (who was brought aboard in May 1989) and keyboardist/songwriter/producer Jesse Harms.|$|E
2500|$|Most of his contemporaries, {{who also}} wrote earlier, are less evasive: {{in the letter}} sent to Queen Joanna and Emperor Charles V (Charles I of Spain) by the constable and town {{authorities}} of la Rica Villa de la Vera Cruz, Cortés's captains narrate the origin of Hernández's expedition saying: [...] "as it is the custom in those islands that {{in the name of}} your majesties are peopled with Spaniards to go for Indians to the islands that are not peopled with Spaniards, to obtain services from them , they sent the <b>abovementioned.....</b> two boats and a brigantine in order that from said islands they would bring Indians to the so-called Fernandina Island, and we think [...] that said Diego Velázquez [...] has the fourth part of said armada".

[...] Bartolomé de Las Casas also says that even if the original intent was to kidnap and enslave Indians, at some point the objective was broadened to one of discovery, which justifies Alaminos.|$|E
2500|$|Though Beaux-Arts {{architecture}} {{of the twentieth century}} might on its surface appear {{out of touch with the}} modern age, steel-frame construction and other modern innovations in engineering techniques and materials were often embraced, as in the 1914–1916 construction of the Carolands Chateau south of San Francisco (which was built with a consciousness of the devastating 1906 earthquake). The noted Spanish structural engineer Rafael Guastavino (1842–1908), famous for his vaultings, known as Guastavino tile work, designed vaults in dozens of Beaux-Arts buildings in the Boston, New York, and elsewhere. Beaux-Arts architecture also brought a civic face to the railroad. (Chicago's Union Station, Detroit's Michigan Central Station, Jacksonville's Union Terminal and Washington, DC's Union Station are famous American examples of this style.) Cincinnati has a number of notable Beaux-Arts style buildings, including the Hamilton County Memorial Building in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, and the former East End Carnegie Library in the Columbia-Tusculum neighborhood. An ecclesiastical variant on the Beaux-Arts style is Minneapolis' Basilica of St. Mary, the first basilica in the United States, which was designed by Franco-American architect Emmanuel Louis Masqueray (1861-1917) and opened in 1914. Two of the best American examples of the Beaux-Arts tradition stand within a few blocks of each other: [...] Grand Central Terminal and the New York Public Library.
