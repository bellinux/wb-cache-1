5|$|Several radars {{were added}} during the war. A Type 285 gunnery radar was mounted {{on top of}} the HACS {{director}} and a Type 271/73 surface search radar was installed <b>abaft</b> the two-pounder guns on the forecastle.|$|E
5|$|Drache {{was also}} used for {{shipboard}} trials with the Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri (Hummingbird) helicopter. She embarked the V6 and V10 prototypes for a period in 1942 and in January–February 1943. They used the small platform <b>abaft</b> the funnel to take-off and land. The Kriegsmarine (German navy) wished to evaluate their potential for anti-submarine warfare and mine reconnaissance, but visual detection proved to be possible only in clear weather.|$|E
5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses <b>abaft</b> the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} she {{received}} her first radars. By August 1943 she mounted a Type 286 target indication set {{as well as a}} Type 285 anti-aircraft gunnery radar. By January 1944 she had received a Type 291 air warning radar. Her light AA armament had also been augmented by six Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon, three {{on each side of the}} roof of the large workshop <b>abaft</b> the funnel. In 1944 Vindictive was converted into a destroyer depot ship and her AA armament was reinforced by the addition of six more Oerlikons. Later that year, the 4-inch guns were removed and eight additional Oerlikons were added. In 1945 she received an additional six Oerlikons.|$|E
5|$|Shōkaku was {{the first}} carrier in the IJN to be fitted with radar, a Type 21 early-warning radar, mounted {{on the top of}} the island around September 1942. The date of Zuikakus {{installation}} is unknown, but both ships received a second Type 21 radar in a retractable installation adjacent to the flight deck after October. Before June 1944, a Type 13 air-search radar was installed on the light tripod mast <b>abaft</b> the island. The Shōkaku-class carriers were also fitted with a Type 91 hydrophone in the bow that was only useful when anchored or moving very slowly.|$|E
5|$|The Mogador-class {{ships were}} {{designed}} for anti-surface warfare rather than anti-submarine work and {{they were given a}} large torpedo battery in consequence. Two triple Modèle 1928T torpedo launchers were fitted on each beam between the funnels and two twin Modèle 1928D launchers were located on the beam, <b>abaft</b> the second funnel. The placement of each launcher on the beam significantly increased each launcher's arc of fire (25° to 150°) in comparison to the Le Fantastaques centerline mount (60°-100°). However this was not without cost as her torpedo broadside was weaker by one tube than the older class, but the extra launchers positioned close to the ship's side imposed, more importantly, a weight and stability penalty.|$|E
5|$|Imperator Nikolai I {{was named}} after the Emperor Nicholas I of Russia. She was built by the Franco-Russian Works at Saint Petersburg. She was laid down on 4 August 1886, {{launched}} on 1 June 1889, and completed in July 1891, although her trials lasted until the spring of 1892. She sailed in June 1892 for New York City {{to participate in the}} celebration honoring the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. Upon her departure she was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron and visited Toulon in October 1893 with the Russian Squadron to reinforce the Franco-Russian Alliance. She was then commanded by Captain Richard Dicker. She sailed for the Pacific Ocean during the First Sino-Japanese War and arrived at Nagasaki, Japan on 28 April 1895, before sailing for Chefoo in China. She remained in the Pacific until late 1896, when she returned to the Mediterranean Squadron and supported Russian interests during the Cretan Revolt. She returned to the Baltic in April 1898 for an extensive, multi-year, refit. Her machinery was replaced with Belleville water-tube boilers and vertical triple expansion steam engines. Her after superstructure was cut down one deck <b>abaft</b> the mainmast and most of her 47mm and 37mm revolving cannon were removed. Only two 37mm revolvers were retained and she received sixteen 47mm and two 37mm single-barreled guns in their place.|$|E
25|$|American style – fishers {{stand on}} {{platforms}} arranged {{over the side}} <b>abaft</b> amidships and around the stern. The vessel moves ahead during fishing operation.|$|E
25|$|She {{was driven}} by eight steam turbines, single-reduction geared to two {{propeller}} shafts. She had three funnels, and her passenger comforts included a full-size tennis court <b>abaft</b> her third funnel. The ship had at least 26 lifeboats, {{most of which were}} mounted in two tiers (see image).|$|E
25|$|Sirius {{was divided}} into three {{passenger}} classes for 70 passengers, with 24 First Class cabins, 22 cabins in the Second Class and 24 in the Third Class section of the ship. The passenger accommodation was located at the main deck, while the cargo holds were situated afore and <b>abaft</b> of the engine room.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} {{changed the}} appearance of the ships. London Valour and her sisters each now had four goalpost masts – two forward of the bridge and two <b>abaft.</b> Each goalpost mast carried four derricks for handling cargo. Another effect of the conversions was that the tonnage of each ship was reduced by a few hundred tons.|$|E
25|$|After coastal {{operations}} off Vietnam from 27 March to 5 May, Terrell County {{retired to}} Japan on one shaft, since her starboard shaft had ceased functioning. On 13 May, as she crept along toward Yokosuka, her lookouts sighted the Soviet merchant ship Makhachala two points <b>abaft</b> the starboard beam and closing. Both ships continued steady on their courses, as Terrell County {{assumed that the}} heavily laden Soviet ship would stay clear. Finally, both ships were forced to maneuver radically to avert a collision.|$|E
25|$|She shipped four BL 4.7 in (120-mm) Mk.I guns on CP VI {{mountings}} in four single centre-line turrets. The turrets were disposed as two {{forward and}} two aft in super imposed firing positions. She also carried two QF 2 pounder Mk.II (40 mm L/39) ("Pom poms") mounted abeam between funnels and five Light machine guns (4 were Lewis guns and 1 was a Maxim). <b>Abaft</b> of the 2nd funnel, she carried six 21-inch Torpedo Tubes in two triple mountings on the centre-line.|$|E
25|$|After the Battle of Shanghai {{had broken}} out in August 1937, President Hoover was {{diverted}} from Hong Kong to evacuate US nationals from Shanghai. She was moored in the Yangtze River, awaiting clearance to enter the Wusong River to reach the Port of Shanghai when, despite a -long US flag draped on her top deck <b>abaft</b> the bridge to identify her to aircraft as a neutral US ship, the Republic of China Air Force mistook her for the Japanese troopship Asama Maru and bombed her.|$|E
25|$|The {{forward and}} midships {{part of the}} ship was against the mole, but her stern was clear of it. The ship broke her back <b>abaft</b> her bridge, further {{separating}} the two groups aboard. MacIsaac remained {{in command of the}} after part, acted with courage and initiative and saved many of his shipmates, but became exhausted by his efforts and did not himself survive. As the after part was not on the rocks, the braver men were able to jump from the stern into the sea and be rescued by the craft that were standing by.|$|E
25|$|Franklin, now the {{flagship}} of TG 38.4, {{returned to the}} Palau area where she launched daily patrols and night fighters. On 9 October, she rendezvoused with carrier groups cooperating in air strikes {{in support of the}} coming occupation of Leyte Island. At twilight on the 13th, the task group came under attack by four bombers, and Franklin twice was narrowly missed by torpedoes. An enemy plane, a harbinger of the coming kamikaze campaign, crashed on Franklins deck <b>abaft</b> the aircraft carrier's island, sliding across the deck and into the water on her starboard beam.|$|E
25|$|The {{change of}} use of the holds meant that Andes four cranes (two forward, two aft) could be removed. The two cranes on her after deck were {{replaced}} with a single kingpost and derrick <b>abaft</b> the E Deck superstructure for loading stores. The superstructure of D Deck was extended both fore and aft to add new cabins, which {{became known as the}} Dutch Cabins. Existing cabins were upgraded so that all now had either a shower or a bathroom en suite. A new children's playroom was added. The after extension allowed the lido area above to be enlarged and given greater facilities, including a cocktail lounge. Air conditioning was extended to all cabins and almost all public accommodation.|$|E
25|$|On 17 May boats from Apollo and Cerberus took {{a vessel}} that ran aground near Brindisi. She was {{armed with a}} 9-pounder gun in the bow and a swivel gun. She was sailing from Otranto to Ancona. The next day the boats also brought off a gun from a Martello tower a little further to the south. Then ten days later the boats {{captured}} three gunboats at Fano that were protecting a convoy. The gun-boats each mounted a 9-pounder in their bows and two 4-pounders <b>abaft.</b> They were {{under the command of}} an Ufficiale di Vascello, carrying troops for Corfu. The British also captured four vessels from the convoy. British losses amounted to two men killed and one wounded.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in December 1976 {{each of the}} Dutch ships {{was given}} a mid-life {{modernization}} that took about two years to finish. The twin 4.5-inch turret {{was replaced by a}} single Otobreda 76 mm gun and two quadruple mounts for Harpoon anti-ship missiles were fitted <b>abaft</b> of the funnel. The Mk 10 Limbo ASW mortar was replaced by a pair of triple Mk 32 torpedo launchers, one mount {{on each side of the}} hangar, and its mount plated over so the flight deck could be increased to allow the ship to carry the larger Westland Lynx helicopter in lieu of the Wasp carried earlier. The removal of the variable-depth sonar from the quarterdeck to the interior of the stern also allowed more room for the flight deck.|$|E

25|$|Louisiana {{was laid}} down in mid-October 1861 by E.C. Murray in a new {{shipyard}} just north of New Orleans. The ship had two paddlewheels and two screws, each driven by its own engine. The paddlewheels were mounted one <b>abaft</b> {{the other in a}} center well. The screws were not intended for propulsion, but were to aid the two rudders in steering in the confined waters and unpredictable currents of the Mississippi. The engines were taken from steamer Ingomar, but two months were needed for their transfer. The casemate extended her full length, less 25 feet at each end. It was covered by T-rail iron in two courses, while its top was encompassed by sheet iron bulwarks nearly four feet high.|$|E
25|$|A {{multipurpose}} {{general cargo}} ship, the vessel {{was capable of}} carrying {{a wide variety of}} cargo ranging from general and dry bulk cargoes to containers, heavy cargo, long goods and trailers. The ship had five holds fitted with tweendecks, four forwards and one <b>abaft</b> of the superstructure. The ship, designed to serve the remote arctic regions, was also equipped with flexible winterized cargo handling equipment for loading and unloading in undeveloped ports. For loading and unloading of general cargo, containers and bulk cargo the ship was geared with four deck cranes located on the centerline, one on the aft deck and three forwards of the superstructure. On the continuous tweendeck the ship could also carry roll-on/roll-off cargo which was loaded and unloaded via a stern quarter ramp that could also be lowered directly on ice.|$|E
25|$|The ships {{have five}} holds fitted with tweendecks, four {{forwards}} and one <b>abaft</b> of the superstructure, {{with a total}} grain capacity of 31,181 cubic metres. The foremost hold, No. 1, is specially designed for the carriage of explosives for the mining industry, inflammable liquids and chemicals in packages, {{and for this reason}} has a separate seawater fire extinguishing system that {{can also be used to}} cool the bulkhead between the foremost holds. Lower holds No. 2, 3 and 4 are designed for bulk cargoes such as coal, ore and grain. Containers can be carried in all holds and on the hatch covers, and the total container capacity of the SA-15 class ships is 576 twenty-foot equivalent units, forty of which can be refrigerated, or 236 forty-foot equivalent units. In addition the ships can carry special ten-foot ore concentrate containers in holds No. 2, 3 and 4, with two layers on tank top and one on tweendeck.|$|E
25|$|By 1 November 1906 tenders for the {{construction}} of a new icebreaker, similar to but slightly larger than Sampo, had been received from four European shipyards. The most expensive tender, 1,608,900 Finnish markkas (FIM), was given by Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft from Germany. It was followed by Sir W G Armstrong Whitworth & Co Ltd from England (FIM 1,575,000), Gourlay Brothers Ship Builders of Dundee from Scotland (FIM 1,432,500), and Burmeister & Wain from Denmark (FIM 1,422,500). When a fifth tender for FIM 1,485,000 was received from the English shipbuilder R. & W. Hawthorn Leslie and Company nine days after the deadline, Armstrong Whitworth lowered their bid by 100,000 markkas to FIM 1,475,000. Wärtsilä Hietalahti shipyard was also asked to participate in the call for tenders, but the domestic shipbuilding was not yet ready to accept such demanding projects and there were difficulties in acquiring and importing steel suitable for icebreakers. The tenders were evaluated by an expert committee appointed by the Senate and, after careful consideration, the icebreaker offered by Armstrong Whitworth turned out to be the most suitable. A number of changes were proposed to the original design including moving the bow propeller slightly <b>abaft</b> and upwards to protect it from grounding and improve the icebreaking characteristics of the ship by reducing the stem angle to 20 degrees. The shipbuilding contract was signed on 15 February 1907, and with the proposed changes the price of the vessel was 1,631,548.81 Finnish markkas.|$|E
500|$|Four {{underwater}} [...] torpedo tubes {{were also}} fitted, two on each broadside in a compartment immediately <b>abaft</b> the forward magazine. Imperatritsa Mariyas trials revealed problems with her magazine cooling systems where the heat {{generated by the}} ventilation system mostly negated the cooling effects of the refrigeration system. Her sisters shared this problem, which {{may have contributed to}} the magazine fire suffered by Imperatritsa Mariya that led to her loss in 1916.|$|E
500|$|The torpedo struck Prince of Wales on {{the port}} side aft, <b>abaft</b> [...] "Y" [...] Turret, {{wrecking}} the outer propeller shaft on that side and destroying bulkheads to one degree or another along the shaft all the way to B Engine Room. This caused rapid uncontrollable flooding and put the entire electrical system in the after part of the ship out of action. Lacking effective damage control, she soon took on a heavy list.|$|E
500|$|During 1917–18, her pole {{foremast}} {{was replaced}} by a tripod mast that was fitted with a gunnery director. In January 1919, Cambrian had her 4-inch guns removed and an additional 6-inch gun added <b>abaft</b> the funnels. At the same time, her AA gun {{was replaced by}} a pair of QF [...] 20-cwt anti-aircraft guns. Sometime between 1919 and 1924 the ship received a pair of 2-pounder (40mm) Mk II [...] "pom-pom" [...] guns on single mounts.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} after completion, her 6-pounder {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) gun {{was replaced by a}} Ordnance QF 3-pounder [...] Vickers Mk II anti-aircraft (AA) gun. Between August–October 1916, her forward pair of 4-inch guns were replaced by another 6-inch gun and a QF 4-inch Mk V gun replaced her 3-pounder AA gun. In 1917, her aftmost 4-inch guns were replaced by another pair of 21-inch torpedo mounts. During 1917–18, her pole foremast was replaced by a tripod mast that was fitted with a gunnery director. In November 1918 her AA gun and a pair of 4-inch guns was replaced by a pair of QF [...] 20-cwt AA guns <b>abaft</b> the bridge, where the 4-inch guns had originally been located. An additional 6-inch gun was added <b>abaft</b> the funnels in March–April 1919 in lieu of her last 4-inch guns. Sometime between 1919 and 1924 the ship received a pair of 2-pounder [...] Mk II [...] "pom-pom" [...] guns on single mounts. All of these changes adversely affected the ship's stability and the additional 21-inch torpedo tubes and the aft control position were removed by the end of 1921.|$|E
500|$|Dreadnought carried five 18-inch (450mm) {{submerged}} torpedo {{tubes in}} three compartments. Each compartment had two torpedo tubes, {{one on each}} broadside, except for the stern compartment which only had one torpedo tube. The forward torpedo room was forward of 'A' turret's magazine and the rear torpedo room was <b>abaft</b> 'Y' turret's magazine. The stern torpedo compartment was shared with the steering gear. Twenty-three Whitehead Mark III* torpedoes were carried between them. In addition six [...] torpedoes were carried for her steam picket boats.|$|E
500|$|Profintern was {{completed}} to nearly her original design, but was modified to handle aircraft by adding cranes {{on either side}} of the middle funnel and a parking area was built for them between the central and rear funnels, although no catapult was ever fitted. Her original internal torpedo tubes were replaced by two triple [...] torpedo tubes mounted on the deck <b>abaft</b> the rear funnel. And her original four 38-caliber [...] anti-aircraft guns were replaced by nine 30-caliber [...] Lender AA guns.|$|E
500|$|All three ships mounted four {{of their}} six 240-millimeter Modèle 1870 guns in the central battery on the battery deck. The other two 240-millimeter guns were mounted in barbettes on the upper deck, sponsoned out over {{the sides of the}} ship. In La Galissonnière the {{sponsons}} were positioned <b>abaft</b> the funnel, but the two later ships had theirs just forward of the funnel. La Galissonnières secondary armament of four [...] guns was also mounted on the upper deck. They were replaced by six [...] guns in 1880.|$|E
500|$|The ships had {{a length}} of [...] overall, a beam of , a draft of [...] at deep load, and a moulded depth of [...] They {{displaced}} [...] at deep load. Based on hydrodynamic research conducted for the s, the Shōkaku class received a bulbous bow and twin rudders, {{both of which were}} positioned on the centerline <b>abaft</b> the propellers. Their crew consisted of 1,660 men: 75 commissioned officers, 56 special duty officers, 71 warrant officers and 1,458 petty officers and crewmen, excluding the air group.|$|E
500|$|In August 1915, her 6-pounder {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) gun {{was replaced}} by a Ordnance QF 3-pounder [...] Vickers Mk II anti-aircraft (AA) gun. In September–October 1917 the ship's armament was extensively revised. Her forward pair of 4-inch guns were replaced by another 6-inch gun, her aftmost 4-inch guns were replaced by another pair of 21-inch torpedo mounts and a QF 4-inch Mk V gun replaced her 3-pounder AA gun. In addition, her pole foremast {{was replaced by}} a tripod mast that was fitted with a gunnery director, her conning tower {{was replaced by a}} lighter one with thinner armour [...] and a flying-off platform installed over the forecastle. This was removed between April and August 1918 when an additional 6-inch gun was added <b>abaft</b> the funnels in lieu of her forward main-deck 4-inch guns. Cordelias last 4-inch guns, including the Mk V AA gun, were replaced by a pair of QF [...] 20-cwt AA guns <b>abaft</b> the bridge, where the 4-inch guns had originally been located. Sometime between 1919 and 1923, the ship received a pair of 2-pounder [...] Mk II [...] "pom-pom" [...] guns on single mounts. All of these changes adversely affected the ship's stability and the additional 21-inch torpedo tubes and the aft control position were removed by the end of 1921.|$|E
500|$|During the war {{the number}} and size of {{rangefinders}} increased. By 1918 Renown carried two [...] rangefinders, one on [...] "Y" [...] turret {{and the other in}} the armoured hood above the conning tower. Fifteen-foot rangefinders were mounted on [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] turrets, the torpedo control tower <b>abaft</b> the mainmast, and the armoured hood. The fore-top was equipped with a [...] rangefinder and the anti-aircraft guns were controlled by a simple [...] rangefinder mounted on the aft superstructure. Two [...] rangefinders were mounted on the bridge.|$|E
500|$|High-tensile steel {{was used}} {{throughout}} the longitudinally-framed hull with mild steel used only in areas that did not contribute to structural strength. This, plus refinements in the design process, meant that the hull was 19% lighter {{than that of the}} preceding [...] pre-dreadnoughts. The hull was subdivided by 13 transverse watertight bulkheads and had a double bottom. The engine and condenser rooms were divided by two longitudinal bulkheads. They had two electrically driven rudders on the centerline, the main rudder <b>abaft</b> the smaller auxiliary rudder. Their designed metacentric height was [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{centralized}} {{fire control}} system {{was similar to}} that of the Le Fantasque-class with 12 × 72 target designation binoculars on each side of the bridge linked by Granat transmitters to the director control towers located atop the bridge and <b>abaft</b> the second funnel. Each DCT had a [...] OPL Modèle 1935 stereoscopic rangefinder and sent the range to the post central 'artillerie where it was fed into a modernized Modèle 1929 electro-mechanical computer which calculated the firing solution and transmitted it to the turrets. The turrets could also be controlled locally if necessary.|$|E
