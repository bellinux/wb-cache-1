5|$|Returning to the Sharks in 2005–06, Ehrhoff {{recorded}} a 23-point campaign. He began earning more ice time {{near the end}} of the season as he improved his defensive play. On 13 April 2006, he scored the game-winning overtime goal against the Vancouver Canucks for the Sharks to clinch <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> berth, despite San Jose having previously been eight points out of <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> spot with a month-and-a-half remaining in the season. Ehrhoff added eight points over 11 post-season games—first among team defencemen—in his first Stanley Cup playoffs as the Sharks were eliminated in the second round by the Edmonton Oilers.

5|$|Although the Colts' rushing defense looked {{extremely}} weak {{during the}} season, {{it ended up}} being a key factor on their road to the Super Bowl. First, Indianapolis defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 23–8, holding Chiefs running back Larry Johnson (who rushed for 1,789 yards during the season) to just 32 yards on 13 carries. Then, they defeated the Baltimore Ravens 15–6, winning on <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> record-tying five field goals by Vinatieri and holding running back Jamal Lewis (who rushed for 1,132 yards during the season) to just 53 yards.|$|E

After the season, Graham, Motley and Speedie were included in many news organizations' All-Pro teams, alongside several other teammates.

5|$|Despite {{his success}} with the Brewers, the team was {{struggling}} and not likely to make <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> run. When talks on a contract extension broke down, the team traded Greinke to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on July 27 in exchange for top infield prospect Jean Segura and pitchers Ariel Peña and Johnny Hellweg. Brewers General Manager Doug Melvin remarked {{that it was one}} of the tougher decisions he had to make because he was very fond of Greinke.|$|E
5|$|Entering April, the Capitals had {{a chance}} to clinch <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> spot against the Tampa Bay Lightning. The game was tied 2–2 with 1:03 {{remaining}} when Steven Stamkos scored, leading Tampa to the eventual 4–2 victory. Facing the Division-leading Panthers in their next game, Washington succeeded in clinching <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> spot with a 4–2 win of their own. The victory also gave the Capitals a chance at winning their Division in their final game. During the game, Neuvirth was hurt when former Capital Marco Sturm fell on top of him while he was making a save. Neuvirth left after the incident and did not return. Neuvirth suffered a lower body injury and was not ready to return for the final game or the start of the playoffs. Washington won its final game of the year behind a 35-save performance from Holtby, clinching at least the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference pending the outcome of Florida’s game. A win by the Panthers in their final game, however, prevented Washington from winning their fifth-straight Division title and moving into the third playoff seed.|$|E

Hershey was losing 4–3 in the third, their first time trailing in the series, but Grubauer was pulled for an extra attacker and Crabb tied the game with 91 seconds in regulation, allowing DiSalvatore to score the game-winner in overtime on a power play.
