DragonFly's messaging subsystem has the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> in either a synchronous or asynchronous fashion, and attempts to use this capability to achieve the best performance possible in any given situation.|$|E
5|$|In August, several Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals {{proposed}} {{the imposition of}} martial law, ostensibly {{to break up the}} demonstrations, but in reality to prepare for a military coup. However, Nhu, already looking to arrest Buddhist leaders and crush the protest movement, used the opportunity to preempt the generals and embarrass them. He disguised Tung's Special Forces in army uniforms and used them to attack the Buddhists, thereby causing the general public and South Vietnam's U.S. allies to blame the army, diminishing the generals' reputations and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as future national leaders.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are various}} {{definition}} of transfer {{found within the}} situated cognition umbrella. Researchers interested in social practice often define transfer as increased participation. Ecological psychology perspectives define transfer as the detection of invariance across different situations. Furthermore, transfer can only [...] "occur {{when there is a}} confluence of an individual's goals and objectives, their acquired <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>act,</b> and a set of affordances for action".|$|R

Artists are here invited to submit questions, propositions and narratives to the audience through their works. “Terminals” features artists Ivana Franke (Croatia), Regina José Galindo (Guatemala), Marjolijn Dijkman (Netherland) and MouSen + MSG (China).|$|R
5|$|The film also touches upon Hollywood's {{perceived}} {{mistreatment of}} women. While the male actors wear masks, which symbolize their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>act,</b> the female Extra #13 does not wear any and is instead expected to simply stand obediently {{and listen to}} the male filmmakers. Her only role is to be an object for men to look upon. The fact that she is able to achieve success by filling this simple role, contrasted against the protagonist's inability to succeed despite his hard work, reveals how differently the film industry views the roles of male and female actors.|$|E
5|$|A myth {{about the}} Eye, known from allusions in the Coffin Texts from the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC) {{and a more}} {{complete}} account in the Bremner-Rhind Papyrus from the Late Period (664–332 BC), demonstrates the Eye's close connection with Ra and Atum and her <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> independently. The myth takes place before {{the creation of the}} world, when the solar creator—either Ra or Atum—is alone. Shu and Tefnut, the children of this creator god, have drifted away from him in the waters of Nu, the chaos that exists before creation in Egyptian belief, so he sends out his Eye to find them. The Eye returns with Shu and Tefnut but is infuriated to see that the creator has developed a new eye, which has taken her place. The creator god appeases her by giving her an exalted position on his forehead {{in the form of the}} uraeus, the emblematic cobra that appears frequently in Egyptian art, particularly on royal crowns. The equation of the Eye with the uraeus and the crown underlines the Eye's role as a companion to Ra and to the pharaoh, with whom Ra is linked. Upon the return of Shu and Tefnut, the creator god is said to have shed tears, although whether they are prompted by happiness at his children's return or distress at the Eye's anger is unclear. These tears give rise to the first humans. In a variant of the story, it is the Eye that weeps instead, so the Eye is the progenitor of humankind.|$|E
5|$|After writing One Hundred Years of Solitude García Márquez {{returned}} to Europe, this time bringing along his family, {{to live in}} Barcelona, Spain, for seven years. The international recognition García Márquez earned {{with the publication of}} the novel led to his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as a facilitator in several negotiations between the Colombian government and the guerrillas, including the former 19th of April Movement (M-19), and the current FARC and ELN organizations. The popularity of his writing also led to friendships with powerful leaders, including one with former Cuban president Fidel Castro, which has been analyzed in Gabo and Fidel: Portrait of a Friendship. It was during this time that he was punched in the face by Mario Vargas Llosa in what became one of the largest feuds in modern literature. In an interview with Claudia Dreifus in 1982 García Márquez notes his relationship with Castro is mostly based on literature: “Ours is an intellectual friendship. It may not be widely known that Fidel is a very cultured man. When we’re together, we talk a great deal about literature.” This relationship was criticized by Cuban exile writer Reinaldo Arenas, in his 1992 memoir Antes de que Anochezca (Before Night Falls).|$|E
50|$|The {{constitutionality}} of plea bargaining {{was established by}} Brady v. United States in 1970, although the Supreme Court warned that plea incentives which were sufficiently large or coercive as <b>to</b> over-rule defendants' <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> freely, or used in a manner giving rise to {{a significant number of}} innocent people pleading guilty, might be prohibited or lead to concerns over constitutionality. Santobello v. New York added that when plea bargains are broken, legal remedies exist.|$|R

We have shown that zeolites under modest conditions can have advantages in para-regioselective nitration, alkylation, acylation, methanesulfonylation and halogenation of aromatic compounds. They can also assist in the electrophilic rearrangement of aryloxiranes. The zeolites can be easily removed from reaction mixtures by filtration and regenerated by heating and can then be reused several times to give the same selectivity...|$|R

40|$|Various pre-modified and post-modified cyclodextrin-calixarene hyper-reticulated co-polymers were synthesized, fully {{characterized}} by different techniques (FT-IR, 13 C{ 1 H} CP-MAS and LGFS solid-state NMR, thermogravimetry, porosimetry), and tested {{to assess their}} absorption abilities as nanosponges. The construction of the polymer network was accomplished exploiting the well-known CuAAC reaction between two different heptakis- 6 -azido [...] cyclodextrins and two different propargyloxy-calix[4]arenes. Post-modification was aimed to achieve the presence of ionizable (acidic or basic) groups on the polymer framework. Sequestration tests towards two model pollutant molecules surprisingly showed that both pristine and post-modified materials actually possess the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as pH-tunable nanosponges...|$|R

25|$|If a rock unit of low {{porosity}} {{is highly}} fractured, {{it can also}} make a good aquifer (via fissure flow), provided the rock has a hydraulic conductivity sufficient to facilitate movement of water. Porosity is important, but, alone, it does not determine a rock's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as an aquifer. Areas of the Deccan Traps (a basaltic lava) in west central India are good examples of rock formations with high porosity but low permeability, which makes them poor aquifers. Similarly, the micro-porous (Upper Cretaceous) Chalk of south east England, although having a reasonably high porosity, has a low grain-to-grain permeability, with its good water-yielding characteristics mostly due to micro-fracturing and fissuring.|$|E
25|$|Here Hume tackles {{the problem}} of how liberty may be {{reconciled}} with metaphysical necessity (otherwise known as a compatibilist formulation of free will). Hume believes that all disputes on the subject have been merely verbal arguments—that is to say, arguments which are based on a lack of prior agreement on definitions. He first shows that it is clear that most events are deterministic, but human actions are more controversial. However, he thinks that these too occur out of necessity since an outside observer can see the same regularity that he would in a purely physical system. To show the compatibility of necessity and liberty, Hume defines liberty as the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on the basis of one's will e.g. the capacity to will one's actions but not to will one's will. He then shows (quite briefly) how determinism and free will are compatible notions, and have no bad consequences on ethics or moral life.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} demonstrates neurologic {{and behavioral}} differences in people’s {{responses to the}} space that is within and beyond reach. The present studies demonstrated a perceptual difference as well. Reachability was manipulated by having participants reach with and without a tool. Across 2 conditions, in which participants either held a tool or not, targets were presented at the same distances. Perceived distances to targets within reach holding the tool were compressed compared with targets that were beyond reach without it. These results suggest that reachability serves as a metric for perception. The 3 rd experiment found that reachability only influenced perceived distance when the perceiver intended to reach. These experiments suggest that the authors perceive the environment {{in terms of our}} intentions and <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> within it...|$|R

25|$|Lead is {{a potent}} neurotoxin whose {{toxicity}} has been recognized for at least thousands of years. Though neurotoxic effects for lead are found in both adults and young children, the developing brain is particularly susceptible to lead-induced harm, effects which can include apoptosis and excitotoxicity. An underlying mechanism by which lead is able to cause harm {{is its ability to}} be transported by calcium ATPase pumps across the BBB, allowing for direct contact with the fragile cells within the central nervous system. Neurotoxicity results from lead’s <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> in a similar manner to calcium ions, as concentrated lead will lead to cellular uptake of calcium which disrupts cellular homeostasis and induces apoptosis. It is this intracellular calcium increase that activates protein kinase C (PKC), which manifests as learning deficits in children as a result of early lead exposure. In addition to inducing apoptosis, lead inhibits interneuron signaling through the disruption of calcium-mediated neurotransmitter release.|$|E
25|$|Factors {{supporting}} {{an important}} role for RNA in early life include its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> both to store information and to catalyze chemical reactions (as a ribozyme); its many important roles as an intermediate in the expression of and maintenance of the genetic information (in the form of DNA) in modern organisms; and the ease of chemical synthesis of at least {{the components of the}} RNA molecule under the conditions that approximated the early Earth. Relatively short RNA molecules have been synthesized, capable of replication. Such replicase RNA, which functions as both code and catalyst provides its own template upon which copying can occur. Jack W. Szostak has shown that certain catalytic RNAs can join smaller RNA sequences together, creating the potential for self-replication. If these conditions were present, Darwinian natural selection would favour the proliferation of such autocatalytic sets, to which further functionalities could be added. Such autocatalytic systems of RNA capable of self-sustained replication have been identified. The RNA replication systems, which include two ribozymes that catalyze each other's synthesis, showed a doubling time of the product of about one hour, and were subject to natural selection under the conditions that existed in the experiment. In evolutionary competition experiments, this led to the emergence of new systems which replicated more efficiently. This was the first demonstration of evolutionary adaptation occurring in a molecular genetic system.|$|E

30|$|Usually, {{game theory}} implicitly assumes that players have {{complete}} {{information about the}} game situation throughout the time period. Therefore, many game models assume that players are on perfect rationality and can have enough <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> according <b>to</b> their preferences. However, this assumption is obviously not satisfied under the real-world environment; experiments have shown that players do not always act intelligently [7]. In addition, traditional game methodologies attempt to optimize individual player’s profit. However, the game players’ group interest is generally not optimized and perhaps not even well served if each individual player optimizes his own behavior. This is because optimization is an individual activity {{that is based on}} the doctrine that each individual is committed to maximizing its own satisfaction without concern for the welfare of others [8].|$|R
