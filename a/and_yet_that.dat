25|$|Like {{many others}} who devoted their life to {{commercial}} art {{in the first half}} of the 20th century, Denis McLoughlin was never paid a great deal for his work. Many pieces of his artwork, the Boardman book covers in particular, which Denis had been promised would be returned to him, were either lost or ended up in private collections. While he made a living, Denis never accumulated much money. Although he had a pension from the British government, he was forced to augment his income by working long past retirement age. He once commented that he never particularly liked illustrating military topics <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>that</b> is what he found himself doing for the last 20 years of his life. Perhaps, had he been given cowboy stories to illustrate, he might have been happier.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} {{oxidation}} state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4, while +2 {{is found in}} carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat, oil, and methane clathrates. Carbon forms {{a vast number of}} compounds, more than any other element, with almost ten million compounds described to date, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>that</b> number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions. For this reason, carbon has often been referred to as the [...] "king of the elements".|$|E
2500|$|In the 17th century, the English nonconformist/Anglican {{priest and}} {{botanist}} John Ray, {{in his book}} The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of Creation (1692), had wondered [...] "why such different species should not only mingle together, but also generate an animal, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>that</b> that hybridous production should not again generate, and so a new race be carried on".|$|E

2500|$|Many of Takahashi's {{works have}} been {{translated}} into English, {{as well as other}} European languages. Takahashi said that she did not know why her works are relatively popular with English speakers. Takahashi said [...] "Sure, there are cultural differences in my work. When I see an American comedy, even though the jokes are translated, there's always a moment when I feel puzzled and think, 'Ah, Americans would probably laugh at this more'. I suppose the same thing must happen with my books. It's inevitable. <b>And</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>that</b> doesn't mean my books can't be enjoyed by English-speaking readers. I feel confident that there's enough substance to them that people from a variety of cultural backgrounds can {{have a lot of fun}} reading them." ...|$|E
2500|$|If I {{send someone}} {{out of the}} room - for example, the mother and child - I {{carefully}} move father from his chair and put him into mother's chair. Or if I send the child out, I might put mother in the child's chair, at least temporarily. Sometimes I comment on this by saying, 'As you sit where your son was sitting, you can think more clearly about him.' Or, 'If you sit where your husband sat, maybe it will give you somewhat of his view about me'. Over a series of interviews with an entire family, I shuffle them about, so that what was originally mother's chair is now where father is sitting. The family grouping remains, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>that</b> family grouping is being rearranged, which is what you are after when changing a family." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goodfellas {{inspired}} director David Chase to {{make the}} HBO television series The Sopranos. Chase said [...] "Goodfellas is the Koran for me." [...] He also told Peter Bogdanovich: [...] "Goodfellas {{is a very important}} movie to me and Goodfellas really plowed that ... I found that movie very funny and brutal and it felt very real. <b>And</b> <b>yet</b> <b>that</b> was the first mob movie that Scorsese ever dealt with a mob crew. ... as opposed to say The Godfather ... which there's something operatic about it, classical, even the clothing and the cars. You know I mean I always think about Goodfellas when they go to their mother's house that night when they're eating, you know when she brings out her painting, that stuff is great. I mean The Sopranos learned a lot from that." [...] Indeed, the film shares a total of 27 actors with The Sopranos, including Sirico, Imperioli, Pellegrino, Lip, Vincent, and Bracco, who would later be cast in major roles in [...] Chase's HBO series.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{obstacles}} {{written for}} the pair included the opposition of Colleen's family to the pairing, J.T.'s music career, and third party characters who came between them. In 2003, J.T. cheated on Colleen with Anita Hodges, an older woman considered a [...] "sexy cougar". Luckinbill explained J.T. as being [...] "weak in a desperate moment", and that he [...] "felt really sorry for someone he's known his whole life, and the good side of J.T. emerged to offer Anita some comfort. Then it got really out of hand." [...] He added that J.T. [...] "cares deeply" [...] for Colleen and [...] "realizes she will be devastated by his actions". Luckinbill felt that J.T. [...] "wouldn't hurt her for the world, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>that</b> is exactly what he'll end up doing". In May 2004, Fonseca's contract was not renewed and she was confirmed to exit. Within the storyline, Colleen leaves Genoa City and J.T. because {{she does not want}} to {{stand in the way of}} his music career. However, she returned to reprise the role briefly that December. [...] J.T. had begun dating Brittany Hodges (Lauren Woodland) and the writers wanted to bring Colleen back to [...] "add more complications to the story". Luckinbill described his character's feelings for Colleen and Brittany as extremely different, saying: [...] "J.T. saw Colleen as somebody so opposite himself that he considered himself undeserving of her love. She was too angelic [...] Brittany has more of the 'black sheep' in her." [...] Fans of the pair campaigned for a reunion between J.T. and Colleen when Fonseca returned, and pushed for her to be put back on contract. Fonseca and Luckinbill also anticipated the repairing of their characters because of a positive viewer response. Fonseca described it as being [...] "the best part of coming back", stating: [...] "Already it seems the fans [...] excited to see us together again." [...] Luckinbill stated: [...] "When they were together, they were like some sort of supercouple and there is a huge amount of fans who still want them together." [...] News of Fonseca's second exit incited a fan outcry and a campaign pushing for the actress's permanent return. Fonseca made her final appearance as Colleen in February 2005.|$|E
