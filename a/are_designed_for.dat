5|$|Horizontal {{broaching}} machines <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> pull broaching, surface broaching, continuous broaching, and rotary broaching. Pull style machines are basically vertical machines {{laid on the}} side with a longer stroke. Surface style machines hold the broach stationary while the workpieces are clamped into fixtures that are mounted on a conveyor system. Continuous style machines {{are similar to the}} surface style machines except adapted for internal broaching.|$|E
5|$|Local transit {{services}} in the city have been available since 1925 and have been provided through the City of Amarillo's Amarillo City Transit (ACT) department since 1966; before that time the system was privately owned. ACT operates bus services that include fixed route transit and demand response paratransit which <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> people with disabilities. The ACT transports approximately 350,000 passengers per year on the fixed route and 30,000 paratransit passengers, {{but it is a}} declining ridership. ACT has no plans to scale back any of their transit routes or services.|$|E

5|$|Many {{children}} with AS are initially misdiagnosed with {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD). Diagnosing adults is more challenging, as standard diagnostic criteria <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> children and the expression of AS changes with age. Adult diagnosis requires painstaking clinical examination and thorough medical history gained from both the individual and other people who know the person, focusing on childhood behavior.|$|E
5|$|The AC {{electric}} motor {{used in a}} VFD system is usually three-phase induction motor. Some types of single-phase motors or synchronous motors advantageous in some situations can be used, but three-phase induction motors are generally preferred as the most economical motor choice. Motors that <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> fixed-speed operation are often used. Elevated-voltage stresses imposed on induction motors that are supplied by VFDs require that such motors be designed for definite-purpose inverter-fed duty in accordance with such requirements as Part 31 of NEMA Standard MG-1.|$|E
5|$|The Training Center for Tropical Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, {{established}} in June 1998 by the UP Board of Regents, {{offers more than}} 300 training programs in forest and land management, logging, and related disciplines. It has a satellite office in Baguio which offers similar programs. Its programs <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> professionals in working in the agroforestry-related disciplines and the wood industry.|$|E
30|$|The DL series {{membrane}} <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> industrial {{high flow}} nanofiltration {{with a minimum}} rejection of 96 %, and the DK series membrane for industrial high rejection nanofiltration with a minimum rejection of 98 %. Both <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> dye removal and concentration; sodium chloride diafiltration; and metals recovery (Electric 2014). The NP 30 membrane <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> the preparation of acid and caustic solutions (Microdyn-Nadir 2014). The NF 45 membrane was labeled as a desalting nanofiltration element for process streams, including applications such as the desalting of organic compounds, acid processing, metal recovery, and antifreeze recovery (Dow 2014 a). The NF 90 membrane <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> the removal of high salt and iron concentrations and normal pesticide, herbicide, and total organic carbon (TOC) levels (Dow 2014 b). The TW 30 membrane <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> {{the production of the}} highest quality water, and the SW 30 membrane <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> seawater reverse osmosis, specifically to obtain the highest flow rates for sea and land-based desalination (Dow 2014 c).|$|R

5|$|Both {{factions in}} Day of Defeat: Source {{have access to}} six classes. Each class is {{designed}} with specific combat circumstances in mind, so that teams must use teamwork to succeed. The weapons and equipment carried by the classes {{are based on the}} weapons used by both the US Army and Wehrmacht during World War II. Some of classes are armed with pistols—the American M1911 or the German Walther P38—while others are equipped with trench knives or entrenching tools for melee combat. Grenades are carried by a number of classes, depending on their role in the game—riflemen are equipped with rifle grenades, the assault classes are armed with a single fragmentation grenade and a smoke grenade for providing concealment, while support classes have access to two standard fragmentation grenades. Riflemen are armed with the M1 Garand or the Karabiner 98 kurz and <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> medium to long range combat, while the assault classes carries the M1 Thompson or the MP40 which are only effective in close quarters. The support classes <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> medium range combat, equipped with either the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle or the StG44. Snipers are used for attacking enemy targets from long range, and are consequently armed with the Springfield M1903 or the Karabiner 98k both equipped with long range scopes. Machine gunners carries the M1919 Browning or the MG42 to defend key locations on a level or to provide a base of fire for their team's advance. Machine gunners are required to deploy their weapons on bipods before firing in order to compensate for the machine gun's extreme recoil. The final class is armed with a Bazooka or a Panzerschreck, used in the game to displace enemy machine gun or sniper positions. This class is armed with either an M1 carbine or Mauser M712 to defend themselves with when moving.|$|E
5|$|Culture {{techniques}} {{are designed to}} promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting {{the growth of the}} other bacteria in the sample. Often these techniques <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> specific specimens; for example, a sputum sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms that cause diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of hemolysis, and staining.|$|E
50|$|Amazon {{was easily}} {{recognisable}} by her slab-sided funnels, characteristic of Thornycroft vessels. Most differences were internal. Unlike earlier <b>designs,</b> which <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> home fleet service, they <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> colonial use, with higher freeboard, cruising turbines and better ventilation.|$|R

50|$|MATILDA {{comes in}} many {{different}} models such as Urban Warrior, Block 2, and Scout Model. Each of these models <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> a specific situation. The Urban Warrior <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> military use {{when it comes to}} aggressive situations such as bomb control, drone control, and rugged terrain. The Block 2 model <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> a more tactical use for law enforcement and the fire department. This model is a jack of traits; it comes with the technology to be aggressive to a certain extent, but also comes with the ability to do reconnaissance. The scout model <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> pure reconnaissance and surveillance. This model is often used in the battlefield to get information or infiltrate enemy bases.|$|R
5|$|GTAW welding torches <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> either {{automatic}} or {{manual operation}} and {{are equipped with}} cooling systems using air or water. The automatic and manual torches are similar in construction, but the manual torch has a handle while the automatic torch normally comes with a mounting rack. The angle between the centerline of the handle and the centerline of the tungsten electrode, known as the head angle, can be varied on some manual torches according to the preference of the operator. Air cooling systems are most often used for low-current operations (up to about 200A), while water cooling is required for high-current welding (up to about 600A). The torches are connected with cables to the power supply and with hoses to the shielding gas source and where used, the water supply.|$|E
5|$|Roguelike-likes are {{generally}} much shorter games {{intended to be}} winnable within a single gaming session, in contrast to traditional roguelikes that <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> multiple sessions of gameplay. Associated with their short length, many roguelike-likes feature a metagame, whereby achieving certain goals will unlock features {{such as the ability}} to select a new character {{at the start of the}} game or the addition of new items and monsters in the procedural generation of the game's levels. Several roguelike-likes feature daily challenges, in which a preset random seed is used to generate the game's levels in a deterministic fashion so that each player will have the same encounters; players attempt to complete the game through those levels or otherwise get the highest score through online leaderboards. Roguelike-likes may also allow the player to enter the random seed directly as to be able to rechallenge the same set of levels or share a difficult set of levels with other players.|$|E
5|$|The costumes used in {{the show}} drew {{inspiration}} {{from a number of}} sources, such as Japanese and Persian armour. Dothraki dress resembles that of the Bedouin (one was made out of fish skins to resemble dragon scales), and the Wildlings wear animal skins like the Inuit. Wildling bone armor is made from molds of actual bones, and is assembled with string and latex resembling catgut. Although the extras who play Wildlings and the Night's Watch often wear hats (normal in a cold climate), members of the principal cast usually do not so viewers can distinguish the main characters. Björk's Alexander McQueen high-neckline dresses inspired Margaery Tyrell's funnel-neck outfit, and prostitutes' dresses <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> easy removal. All clothing used is aged for two weeks so it appears realistic on high-definition television.|$|E

The government {{has announced plans to}} add five marine parks to the system as part of the Marine Conservation Areas Act. The first to be announced was Lake Superior in 2007; it was officially established in 2015. Other areas under negotiation are the southern Strait of Georgia and Gwaii Haanas in British Columbia, and there are discussions to study the feasibility of an area on the southern coast of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} aging Class C trains, from 1985 to 1987, ten T4s were {{converted}} to T1300. They were equipped with a pantograph, received a new front and the doors were moved. Six additional T4s were converted in 1989, and given the designation T8. These only had the pantographs equipped and kept the same front and door arrangement. With {{the introduction of the}} T1300, the western lines could remove the conductor and have single-manned trains with the motorman selling tickets. The T1300-units have had better regularity than the older models they replaced. However, because they <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> a closed system with automatic train protection, the braking systems are not sufficiently dimensioned for when the drivers use line of sight to regulate the speed and distances between trains. The 1300 units were numbered 1301–1349. After the conversions, Oslo Sporveier operated 49 T1300-cars and 146 T1000-cars. The trains were originally painted red with a beige cheatline.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{stage of}} the insect is the winged adult or imago. The surface of both butterflies and moths is covered by scales, {{each of which is}} an outgrowth from a single epidermal cell. The head is small and dominated by the two large compound eyes. These are capable of distinguishing flower shapes or motion but not for clearly viewing distant objects. Colour perception is good, especially in some species in the blue/violet range. The antennae are composed of many segments and have clubbed tips (unlike moths that have tapering or feathery antennae). The sensory receptors are concentrated in the tips and can detect odours. Taste receptors are located on the palps and on the feet. The mouthparts <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> sucking and the mandibles are usually reduced in size or absent. The first maxillae are elongated into a tubular proboscis which is curled up at rest and expanded when needed to feed. The first and second maxillae bear palps which function as sensory organs. Some species have a reduced proboscis or maxillary palps and do not feed as adults.|$|E

5|$|Thousands {{of plant}} species are {{cultivated}} for aesthetic purposes {{as well as}} to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion. Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel to historic gardens, national parks, rainforests, forests with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as Japan's and America's cherry blossom festivals. While some gardens are planted with food crops, many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. Arboretums and botanical gardens are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and bedding plants are used. Gardeners may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with topiary or espalier. Gardening is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or horticulture therapy is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as houseplants, or in specialized buildings such as greenhouses that <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> the care and cultivation of living plants. Venus Flytrap, sensitive plant and resurrection plant are examples of plants sold as novelties. There are also art forms specializing in the arrangement of cut or living plant, such as bonsai, ikebana, and the arrangement of cut or dried flowers. Ornamental plants have sometimes changed the course of history, as in tulipomania.|$|E
