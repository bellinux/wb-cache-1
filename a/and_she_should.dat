5|$|Senator Kelly is {{abducted}} by two more of Magneto's minions, Toad and Mystique, and {{is brought to}} their hideout on the uncharted island of Genosha. There, Magneto uses Kelly as a test subject for a machine powered by his magnetic abilities that generates a field of radiation, inducing mutation in normal humans. Kelly later escapes {{by taking advantage of}} his newfound mutation. When Rogue uses her power on Wolverine in view of her classmates, she is convinced by Mystique, disguised as classmate Bobby Drake, that Xavier is angry with her <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> leave the school. Xavier uses his mutant-locating machine Cerebro to find Rogue at a train station, and the X-Men go to retrieve her. Meanwhile, Mystique enters Cerebro and sabotages it.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} her resistance to pain he would drop hot sealing wax {{on her back and}} arms or stick pins in her, commanding her not to cry out. He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his life was in danger <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave her a big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E
5|$|Danielle later {{breaks down}} and tells Ronnie {{that she is}} {{pregnant}} by Paul, a barman she had a one-night stand with. She intended {{to tell him about}} her pregnancy until he reveals he has a girlfriend. Ronnie comforts Danielle and contacts Andy, suggesting that he take Danielle home but she resists in favour of staying close to Ronnie. She is dismayed when Ronnie confides in her that having her own child was the biggest mistake of her life. Danielle makes up with Stacey and decides to terminate her pregnancy. She is delighted when Ronnie accompanies her to the clinic but dismayed when she backs out of attending her second appointment. Following her abortion, Danielle visits her family for a while, but soon comes to miss Ronnie and Stacey and returns to Walford. Danielle becomes increasingly angry with Ronnie for rejecting her. She decides that she will tell Ronnie who she really is and leave Walford for good but Archie stops her when he learns who she is. Unknown to Danielle, Archie has told Ronnie that her daughter died as an infant, so in order to preserve his story, he convinces Danielle that Ronnie suffers from depression <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> keep quiet until he decides the time is right to make her revelation. Although Danielle continues to press Archie to reveal the truth, he repeatedly puts her off to maintain his lie. Eventually, believing that Archie has told Ronnie about her, Danielle tells her the truth but Ronnie refuses to believe her. Distraught, Danielle intends to leave Walford but Ronnie discovers that Archie has been lying and chases her. They are about to reconcile when Danielle is accidentally run over by a car driven by Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). Ronnie cradles Danielle and apologises for not believing her, saying that if she had known, she would never have given her up.

25|$|When the {{ambulance}} finally arrives, the nurse, Mioara (Luminiţa Gheorghiu), dispels {{the idea that}} Lăzărescu's ulcer surgery over a decade before could cause this pain. While taking a patient history, she suspects that Lăzărescu has colon cancer. After informing his sister, {{who lives in a}} different city, that the condition could be serious <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> visit Lăzărescu in the hospital, the nurse decides to get him to a hospital. His sister makes arrangements to come the following day; his only child, a daughter, lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.|$|E
25|$|On the {{election}} of Bill Shorten as Leader of the Labor Party and Leader of the Opposition in October 2013, Bryce offered her resignation to the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, in order to forestall any perception of bias, given that Bryce's daughter Chloe Shorten is married to Shorten. While acknowledging her magnanimity, Abbott declined to accept her resignation {{and asked her to}} serve the rest of her term. According to him Bryce provided continuity at a time of political turbulence <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> be commended for her dedication to public service.|$|E

25|$|Originally from Czechoslovakia, she was {{stripped}} of her citizenship when, in 1975 at age 18, she asked the United States for political asylum and was granted temporary residency. At the time, Navratilova {{was told by the}} Czechoslovak Sports Federation that she was becoming too Americanised, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> go back to school and make tennis secondary. Navratilova became a US citizen in 1981, and on January 9, 2008, she reacquired Czech citizenship. She stated she has not renounced her U.S. citizenship nor does she plan to do so, and that reclaiming Czech nationality was not politically motivated.|$|E
25|$|If {{the straps}} {{dig into the}} {{shoulder}}, leaving red marks or causing shoulder or neck pain, the bra band is not offering enough support. If breast tissue overflows {{the bottom of the}} bra, under the armpit, or over the top edge of the bra cup, the cup size is too small. Loose fabric in the bra cup indicates the cup size is too big. If the underwires poke the breast under the armpit or if the bra's center panel does not lie flat against the sternum, the cup size is too small. If the band rides up the torso at the back, the band size is too big. If it digs into the flesh, causing the flesh to spill over the edges of the band, the band is too small. If the band feels tight, {{this may be due to}} the cups being too small; instead of going up in band size a person should try going up in cup size. Similarly a band might feel too loose if the cup is too big. It is possible to test whether a bra band is too tight or too loose by reversing the bra on her torso so that the cups are at the back and then check for fit and comfort. Generally, if the wearer must continually adjust the bra or experiences general discomfort, the bra is a poor fit <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> get a new fitting.|$|E
500|$|As final {{preparations}} for the play are made, Tuptim steals a moment to meet with Lun Tha. He tells her he has an escape plan, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> be ready to leave after the performance ("I Have Dreamed"). [...] Anna encounters them, and they confide in her ("Hello, Young Lovers", reprise). The play ("Small House of Uncle Thomas", narrated ballet) is presented in a Siamese ballet-inspired dance. Tuptim is the narrator, and she tells her audience of the evil King Simon of Legree and his pursuit of the runaway slave Eliza. Eliza is saved by Buddha, who miraculously freezes a river and conceals her in snow. Buddha then causes the river to melt, drowning King Simon and his hunting party. [...] The anti-slavery message is blunt.|$|E

500|$|Adams' live {{rendition}} of [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] was generally well-received by critics. George Lang of The Oklahoman {{described it as}} a [...] "perky" [...] performance, additionally commenting, [...] " [...] great... <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have already racked up her first Oscar for acting by now." [...] The Boston Globes Wesley Morris wrote, [...] "Watching Amy Adams sing... makes you appreciated [...] the magic of the movies." [...] However, the performance generated some mild controversy revolving around the fact that while Adams was selected to perform [...] "Happy Working Song", Broadway actress and singer Kristin Chenoweth was hired to sing [...] "That's How You Know" [...] live at the ceremony. When questioned about this, Disney executives told the Los Angeles Times that [...] "it's best [...] sing 'Happy Working Song' because it has so many parallels to Julie Andrews in Mary Poppins".|$|E
500|$|She was {{captured}} on 17 March 1918 when Nikolaev {{was occupied by}} the Germans and Austrians, but they did nothing with her incomplete hull. On 25 January 1919 she was listed by the Directorate of Ukraine as planned to be completed and included into the navy list by 1920. On 27 January 1919 she was mentioned at Directorate Navy Ministry order at the list for renaming from 1920 [...] – into Soborna Ukraina (: Union of Ukraine). However none of the short-lived Directorate orders were actually implemented. She remained at Nikolayev throughout the Russian Civil War, of no use to either side. The victorious Soviets finally inspected her in 1923 {{to see if she}} was worth completing. Her dilapidated state and obsolescent design caused them to conclude that it was not worth doing <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> be sold for scrap. Efforts were made to sell the hull abroad to raise hard currency, but when these came to nought she was towed to Sevastopol on 28 June 1927 to begin dismantling.|$|E
500|$|As an adolescent, Olga {{received}} frequent reminders {{from her}} mother to be an example for the other children and to be patient with her younger sisters and with her nurses. On January 11, 1909, Alexandra admonished thirteen-year-old Olga for rudeness and bad behavior. She told the teenager that she must be polite to the servants, who looked after her well and did their best for her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not make her nurse [...] "nervous" [...] when she was tired and not feeling well. Olga responded on January 12, 1909 that she would try to do better but it wasn't easy because her nurse became angry and cross with her for no good reason. However, Ersberg, one of the maids, told her niece that the servants sometimes {{had good reason to}} be cross with Olga because the eldest grand duchess could be spoiled, capricious, and lazy. On January 24, 1909, Alexandra scolded the active teenager, who once signed another of her letters with the nickname [...] "Unmounted Cossack", again: [...] "You are growing very big — don't be so wild and kick about and show your legs, it is not pretty. I never did so when your age or when I was smaller and younger even." ...|$|E

500|$|As December arrived, {{production}} was halted {{for a few}} days due to snowfall in New York City. Madonna decided to utilize the time by working on the film's soundtrack and her next concert tour. While recording the title track, Madonna decided to change the film's name from Slammer to Who's That Girl as she felt it to be a better title. Filming commenced in January 1987, where the scene involving a cougar was shot. During the second take, the cougar accidentally escaped from the cage, resulting in filming being paused for a few hours. By February 1987, Madonna's scenes were already shot although she proceeded to linger on the set to watch Foley and his team work. Foley described her being around the set and not acting as a [...] "pain-in-the-ass", since she [...] "wont skimp especially on cost <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> know that Warner had a tight schedule and constraints on the budget. They still did not trust Madonna when it came to acting. Hell they even gave a greater percentage of the budget to the soundtrack." [...] Filming ended in March 1987, with post-production continuing till July 1987. During the development of the starting credits, Madonna asked Foley if they could have a cartoon figure of her character introducing the film credits. Foley liked the idea, and Warner enlisted cartoonist April March to create the cartoon.|$|E
500|$|Naz {{arrives in}} Walford having bought a fake ID from Fatboy (Ricky Norwood), {{but she is}} angry that the photo looks nothing like her and the age is too high, so she steals her money back from him. He chases after her but she is rescued by Sol Levi (Tosin Cole). She removes her makeup and changes into plain clothes to return home but hears [...] (Nayeef Rashed) {{shouting}} so leaves. She meets Sol {{and his older brother}} Asher (Heshima Thompson), and goes with them to Stevie Dickinson's (Amanda Fairbank-Hynes) flat where Stevie allows them to stay. Naz and Sol begin to bond, and she kisses him to avoid being seen by [...] (Hemi Yeroham). However, Ekin later finds her and takes her to her parents' house where it is revealed that Naz and Ekin are to be married. Naz and Sol almost kiss twice but are interrupted both times, the second time by the arrival of Ekin, who tells Naz's friends they are engaged. Naz and Sol argue and she says she is not engaged to Ekin but then says she is, leaving Sol angry. She then discovers it is Stevie's birthday and arranges a surprise dinner party for her. Stevie tells her that Sol likes her <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> kiss him, but he insults her because Ekin has inadvertently led him to believe Asher and Naz are seeing each other.|$|E
500|$|Later on, Meg knocks Brian out, {{puts him}} {{in the trunk of}} his car and drives away. Chris tells Lois that he saw this, so Lois, Peter, Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire track them down at the Barrington Hotel. When they arrive, they see Meg has tied Brian up with {{packaging}} tape and is about to rape Brian. Lois tells Meg that she is not thinking right, although Meg insists that she has never been more sure of anything in her life. Lois struggles to explain and says Meg does not know what she needs, and then Quagmire says (in an erotic tone) [...] "I know what she needs... Bring her by my house around 8:30 tonight I'll take care of her." [...] This implies that he will try to take advantage of Meg and when she arrives at Quagmire's house, it seems even more likely; he tells her to sit down and says [...] "Soon it'll all become clear", puts on seductive music, dims the lights, strips down to a speedo and sits down beside her; but suddenly, Quagmire (uncharacteristically) begins to have a serious heart-to-heart talk with Meg, telling her that her entire life is still ahead of her <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not be in such a hurry to grow up before assuring her that she will find the right person one day. To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of The Missing Piece to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better. He then walks into his bedroom, where two of his one-night stands await with an array of sex toys, {{and it turns out that}} all of Quagmire's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst. One of the women asks Quagmire if he has the [...] "hwhip" [...] (with emphasis on the [...] "h") and Quagmire responds with disbelief.|$|E

500|$|Other comics by Romano Scarpa {{have the}} Queen in her {{youthful}} form. In the three-part [...] "Snow White and the Green Flame" [...] (Biancaneve e verde fiamma), the Queen flies on a broom {{to the great}} gathering of witches, who declare that her inability to deal {{with just a little}} girl and few dwarfs has disgraced them all <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> be punished for this according to the laws of Hell. The Queen begs the High Witch for mercy and is given a magic wand with the power of transformation, but if she would not succeed this time she will be turned into a magic broom for a more [...] "honorable" [...] witch to fly. The Queen uses the wand to gain trust of Snow White and turn her a figurine, than takes the princess' form to ambush the dwarfs and do the same with them, and waits for the Prince's arrival to kill him. Only Dopey escapes and eventually manages to outwit the Queen, using her want to restore his friends and transform her into a figurine, which later turns into a broom when her sentence is carried over. In [...] "The Seven Dwarfs and the Throne of Diamonds" [...] (I Sette Nani e il trono di diamanti), Jiminy Cricket is deeply enamored by the Queen's beauty and attempts to convince her to become good, but the Queen refuses to be redeemed and orders her soldiers to steal the throne the Dwarfs make for Snow White in a plot to turn her rival into an old woman.

2500|$|In 1929, Dennett {{was arrested}} for her work with sex education, women's rights, and birth control. Many people felt that her work was obscene <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> be imprisoned or fined.
