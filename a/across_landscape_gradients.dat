40|$|Habitat {{loss and}} {{fragmentation}} threaten the future {{integrity of the}} Sierra Nevada by disrupting important ecological interactions and patterns of movement. Concerns about loss and fragmentation of habitat extend from aquatic to terrestrial systems in this region (Centers for Water and Wildland Resources 1996). Increases in temperature and changes in precipitation due to climate change are likely to exacerbate these effects on habitat through changes in disturbance cycles and seasonal weather patterns. To adapt to climate-driven shifts in habitat, species may need to adjust their range and movement patterns. Barriers to dispersal could result in plant and wildlife populations that are highly vulnerable to extirpation and extinction. Maintaining and re-establishing connectivity of healthy habitats <b>across</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients</b> would facilitate climate-induced species migration and increase the potential for successful adaptation {{in the face of}} climate variability and other human induced stressors (Blate et al. 2009, Moritz et al. 2008, Innes et al. 2009). The concerns about habitat fragmentation and barriers to movement are widespread. The scientific community has been studying the issues related to habitat fragmentation and wildlife persistence for decades. More recently, multiple state and federal agencies have identified the importance of providing for habitat connectivity in the face of climate change and other stressors (Western Governor’s Association 2008; Spencer et al. 2010; US Fish and Wildlife Service 2010).

40|$|Savanna grasslands are {{characterized}} by high spatial heterogeneity in vegetation structure, aboveground biomass and nutritional quality, with high quality short- grass grazing lawns forming mosaics with patches of tall bunch grasses of lower quality. This heterogeneity can arise because of local differences in consumption, because of differences in productivity, or because both processes enforce each other (more production and consumption). However, {{the relative importance of}} both processes in maintaining mosaics of lawn and bunch grassland types has not been measured. Also their interplay been not been assessed <b>across</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients.</b> In a South African savanna, we, therefore, measured the seasonal changes in primary production, nutritional quality and herbivore consumption (amount and percentage) of grazing lawns and adjacent bunch grass patches across a rainfall gradient. We found both higher amounts of primary production and, to a smaller extent, consumption for bunch grass patches. In addition, for bunch grasses primary production increased towards higher rainfall while foliar nitrogen concentrations decreased. Foliar nitrogen concentrations of lawn grasses decreased much less with increasing rainfall. Consequently, large herbivores targeted the biomass produced on grazing lawns with on average 75 % of the produced biomass consumed. We conclude that heterogeneity in vegetation structure in this savanna ecosystem is better explained by small- scale differences in productivity between lawn and bunch grass vegetation types than by local differences in consumption rates. Nevertheless, the high nutritional quality of grazing lawns is highly attractive and, therefore, important for the maintenance of the heterogeneity in species composition (i. e. grazing lawn maintenance) ...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the rapidly}} {{increasing}} volume {{of research on}} the biological and photochemical degradation of DOC (dissolved organic carbon) in aquatic environments, little is known of the large-scale patterns in biologically and photochemically degradable DOC (BDOC and PDOC, respectively) in continental watersheds, and on the links that exist between these two key properties that greatly influence the flow of carbon from continents to oceans. Here we explored the patterns in the concentrations and proportions of BDOC and PDOC across hundreds of boreal lakes, rivers and wetlands spanning a large range of system trophic status and terrestrial influence, and compared the drivers of these two reactive pools of DOC at the landscape level. Using standardized incubations of natural waters, we found that the concentrations of BDOC and PDOC covaried across all systems studied but were nevertheless related to different pools of dissolved organic matter (DOM; identified by fluorescence analyses) in ambient waters. Concentrations of nutrients and protein-like fluorescent DOM (FDOM) explained nearly half of the variation in BDOC, whereas PDOC was exclusively predicted by DOM optical properties, consistent with the photochemical degradability of specific FDOM pools that we experimentally determined. The concentrations of colored DOM (CDOM), which we use here as a proxy of terrestrial influence, almost entirely accounted for the observed relationship between FDOM and the concentrations of both BDOC and PDOC. The concentrations of CDOM and of the putative biolabile fluorescence component shifted from complete decoupling in clear-water environments to strong coupling in darker streams and wetlands. This suggests a baseline autochthonous BDOC pool fueled by internal production that is gradually overwhelmed by land-derived BDOC as terrestrial influence increases <b>across</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients.</b> The importance of land as a major source of both biologically and photochemically degradable DOC for continental watersheds resulted in a partial coupling of those carbon pools in natural freshwaters, despite fundamental contrasts in terms of their composition and regulation...|$|E
40|$|Bumble-bee declines across Europe {{have been}} linked to loss of habitat and forage {{availability}} due to agricultural intensification. These declines may have severe ecological and commercial consequences since bumble-bees pollinate a range of wildflowers and crops. In England, attempts are being made to reintroduce forage resources through agri-environment schemes, yet there are few data on how the area of forage, or the landscape context in which it is provided, affects their success. We investigated the effects of sown forage patches on bumble-bees across sites varying in landscape characteristics. Bumble-bee densities were higher on sown patches compared with control habitats but did not vary with patch size, i. e. total forager numbers were proportional to patch area. Importantly, the relative response to sown forage patches varied widely <b>across</b> a <b>landscape</b> <b>gradient</b> such that their impact in terms of attracting foraging bumble-bees was greatest where the proportion of arable land was highest...|$|R
40|$|Biological di-nitrogen {{fixation}} (N 2) is {{the dominant}} natural source of new nitrogen to land ecosystems. Phosphorus (P) is thought to limit N 2 fixation in many tropical soils, yet both molybdenum (Mo) and P are crucial for the nitrogenase reaction (which catalyzes N 2 conversion to ammonia) and cell growth. We have limited understanding of how and when fixation is constrained by these nutrients in nature. Here we show in tropical forests of lowland Panama that the limiting element on asymbiotic N 2 fixation shifts along a broad <b>landscape</b> <b>gradient</b> in soil P, where Mo limits fixation in P-rich soils while Mo and P co-limit in P-poor soils. In no circumstance did P alone limit fixation. We provide and experimentally test a mechanism that explains how Mo and P can interact to constrain asymbiotic N 2 fixation. Fixation is uniformly favored in surface organic soil horizons - a niche characterized by exceedingly low levels of available Mo relative to P. We show that soil organic matter acts to reduce molybdate over phosphate bioavailability, which, in turn, promotes Mo limitation in sites where P is sufficient. Our findings show that asymbiotic N 2 fixation is constrained by the relative availability and dynamics of Mo and P in soils. This conceptual framework can explain shifts in limitation status <b>across</b> broad <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients</b> in soil fertility and implies that fixation depends on Mo and P {{in ways that are}} more complex than previously thought...|$|R

Species-level classifications of AVIRIS and CASI hyperspectral imagery were all near 80 % overall accuracy for the target bioindicator species. Combining remote sensing indices with GIS variables related to microsite ozone uptake variability produced improved regressions for Catalonia (R 2 = 0. 68, p< 0. 0001) and California (R 2 = 0. 56, p< 0. 0001). Multiple regression models for the ozone injury visual component (VI) alone performed {{much better than the}} full OII in Catalonia combining the remote sensing index PRI and a three year average of ambient ozone (R 2 = 0. 56, p< 0. 0001) and better still when including GIS variables (R 2 = 0. 77, p< 0. 0001).

40|$|Ecosystems are {{the largest}} source of {{atmospheric}} methane, an important greenhouse gas whose atmospheric concentration is increasing 1 % annually. My dissertation research on the environmental controls over methane flux {{suggests that there is}} the potential for significant feedback between climatic change and methane flux from ecosystems. From 1991 to 1993, I conducted a variety of field experiments in Alaskan tundra, California annual grasslands, and Colorado montane meadow, measuring methane flux with static chambers. Emission rates from the Alaskan wet tundra averaged 52 mg CH 4 m- 2 d- 1 and from California pond margin averaged 38 mg CH 4 m- 2 d- 1. Methane uptake in the Colorado montane meadow averaged - 1. 2 mg CH 4 m- 2 d- 1 and in the California grassland averaged - 0. 7 mg CH 4 m- 2 d- 1. Over the annual cycle and <b>across</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients,</b> methane flux was positively correlated with soil moisture and temperature at all three sites. Moisture was the dominant factor, since unsaturated soils took up methane (small negative flux) while saturated soils emitted methane (large positive flux). The response of flux to changes in water level was rapid and direct, rather than occurring via moisture-induced changes in vegetation. Plants did provide an important pathway for methane emissions, however, by allowing methane to bypass the zone of methane oxidation at the soil or water surface. In the grassland, soil carbon and nitrogen explained 97 % of the spatial variation in annually-averaged uptake rates, independent of sheep-grazing. My research showed that emissions and uptake respond differently to changes in soil micro-climate. An increase in moisture increased emissions but decreased uptake (with an important exception in very dry soils, when further drying decreased uptake rates). Emissions increased exponentially with temperature while uptake showed a weak response to temperature. A model that takes into account both the differential effect of temperature on emissions and uptake, and the fact that net emissions are the balance of production and consumption, predicts three times more change in global ecosystem emissions in response to a 10 °C warming than does a model that ignores these two features and includes only net methane release. Therefore, the magnitude of the eedback generated between methane flux from ecosystems and climate is probably much greater than would be estimated by traditional methane-cycle models, which ignore these two features...|$|E

[...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 Aquatic {{ecosystem}} {{responses to}} changing climate and land-use are often extremely heterogeneous across landscapes: studies than quantify relationships between watershed features and biogeochemical and food web processes at intermediate scales (e. g., watershed-scale) {{would provide a}} means to extrapolate local findings <b>across</b> <b>landscapes,</b> potentially aiding future management efforts. I investigated how watershed features influence the movement of materials and energy between aquatic and terrestrial environments. I worked in a nearly pristine boreal river system in southwest Alaska (Wood River), where {{a high level of}} physical heterogeneity, coupled with natural <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients,</b> provided an opportunity to explore watershed geomorphic controls on ecosystem processes in streams. In Chapter 2 I used fatty acid biomarkers as novel tracers of food web pathways to assess how assimilation of heterotrophic bacteria and algae by stream insects varied <b>across</b> a <b>landscape</b> <b>gradient</b> in watershed features. I found that watershed features such as mean slope are correlated with the energetic base of food webs in boreal streams, with algal resources more important in steep streams and bacterial resources more important in flat watersheds. In Chapter 3 I used fatty acid and stable isotope tracers, coupled with several years of growth data, to investigate how stream thermal regimes affected the ability of juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to benefit from marine resource subsidies (sockeye salmon eggs). I found that local environmental conditions (mean summer stream temperature) were a stronger control on fish growth than the magnitude of the resource subsidy, but also that individuals varied substantially in their metabolic responses to an energy-rich food source. In Chapter 4 I examined geomorphic controls on the magnitude and sources of stream CO 2 emissions from boreal streams. I found that watershed slope interacts with precipitation events to control terrestrial carbon fluxes into and out of streams. Watershed slope influences C loading and stream CO 2 fluxes by determining the amount of carbon accumulation in watersheds, {{and to a lesser extent}} by determining gas transfer velocity across the air-water interface. These patterns provide a way to extrapolate <b>across</b> boreal <b>landscapes</b> by constraining CO 2 concentration and flux estimates by local geomorphic features. In this dissertation I demonstrated that interactions between geomorphology, climate, and organisms produce incredible variability in ecosystem processes (carbon cycling, food web pathways) within a single river system, but that geomorphic features of watersheds regulate that variability...|$|R
40|$|Predicting the hydrologic {{consequences}} of biomass cropping systems {{requires an understanding}} of how different crops and management practices affect soil hydraulic properties across space and time. To inform such predictions, I investigated the impacts of five biomass cropping systems on the hydraulic properties of soils <b>across</b> a <b>landscape</b> <b>gradient</b> in wet, dry, and average rainfall years. I used data from 2010 - 2012 on monthly volumetric soil moisture content and data from 2009 - 2013 on changes in saturated hydraulic conductivity to measure significant differences in mean soil moisture content among five cropping systems <b>across</b> five <b>landscape</b> positions. My results suggest moisture content was most broadly controlled by the amount of rainfall within a year, but there were also significant differences with landscape positions, cropping systems, cropping system by landscape position, and soil clay content; biomass yield was not a significant predictor of soil moisture. I also found a significant change in saturated hydraulic conductivity among cropping systems from 2009 to 2013, and different saturated conductivity among cropping systems at different landscape positions in 2013. Differences in hydraulic conductivity among cropping systems were commonly found at floodplain and footslope positions; there were very few significant differences among cropping systems at the summit, shoulder, and backslope positions. Changes over time within cropping systems are attributed to conversion to either perennial cropping systems or to no-till soil management in annual systems. My results support the hypothesis that different biomass cropping systems will have different hydrological impacts depending on landscape position. This knowledge can be used to parameterize or improve physically-based hydrologic models of biomass production and understand the potential environmental impacts bioenergy crop production...|$|R

Their persistence in the environment and their resistance to unfavorable temperatures are governed by their physiological thermal tolerance. 2. Global change extends beyond climatic conditions to encompass modifications to the landscape. However, studies of climate change and landscape composition effects on ecosystem services, such as biological control, are commonly performed independently. Moreover, coarse scales are not always relevant when assessing climate change’s impacts on ectotherms. We aimed {{to better understand the}} ecological relationships that may exist between microclimatic variation and insect thermal tolerance <b>across</b> a <b>landscape</b> composition <b>gradient.</b> 3. To determine how landscape composition may impact insect thermal tolerance, parasitic wasps (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae) of aphids were sampled along a <b>landscape</b> <b>gradient</b> from “closed” to “open” habitats. Sampling was performed during the winter 2013 / 14 and spring 2014 in cereal fields of Brittany, France. Meteorological data were recorded along this gradient. 4. First, our results show an influence of landscape composition on local microclimate. Additionally, parasitoids from open landscapes had a higher tolerance to low temperatures, leading to higher physiological costs, compared to parasitoids from closed landscapes. This trend was stronger in winter than in spring. 5. These results have numerous implications in the context of climate change, suggesting that targeted landscape management practices could create sheltered microclimatic areas that reduce the physiological costs of thermal tolerance, and promote the persistence of biological control agents...|$|R
40|$|Landscape {{heterogeneity}} in floral communities has {{the potential}} to modify pollinator behavior. Pollinator foraging varies with the diversity, abundance, and spatial configuration of floral resources. However, the implications of this variation for pollen transfer and ultimately the reproductive success of insect pollinated plants remains unclear, especially for species which are rare or isolated in the landscape. We used a landscape-scale experiment, coupled with microsatellite genotyping, to explore how the floral richness of habitats affected pollinator behavior and pollination effectiveness. Small arrays of the partially self-compatible plant Californian poppy (Eschscholzia californica) were introduced <b>across</b> a <b>landscape</b> <b>gradient</b> to simulate rare, spatially isolated populations. The effects on pollinator activity, outcrossing, and plant reproduction were measured. In florally rich habitats, we found reduced pollen movement between plants, leading to fewer long-distance pollination events, lower plant outcrossing, and a higher incidence of pollen limitation. This pattern indicates a potential reduction in per capita pollinator visitation, as suggested by the lower activity densities and richness of pollinators observed within florally rich habitats. In addition, seed production reduced by a factor of 1. 8 in plants within florally rich habitats and progeny germination reduced by a factor of 1. 2. We show this to be a consequence of self-fertilization within the partially self-compatible plant, E. californica. These findings indicate that locally rare plants are at a competitive disadvantage within florally rich habitats because neighboring plant species disrupt conspecific mating by co-opting pollinators. Ultimately, this Allee effect may {{play an important role in}} determining the long-term persistence of rarer plants in the landscape, both in terms of seed production and viability. Community context therefore requires consideration when designing and implementing conservation management for plants which are comparatively rare in the landscape...|$|R
40|$|Flow regime, the magnitude, {{duration}} {{and timing of}} streamflow, controls the development of floodplain landforms on which riparian vegetation communities assemble. Streamflow scours and deposits sediment, structures floodplain soil moisture dynamics, and transports propagules. Flow regime interacts with environmental gradients like climate, land-use, and biomass-removing disturbance to shape riparian plant distributions <b>across</b> <b>landscapes.</b> These <b>gradients</b> select for groups of riparian plant species with traits {{that allow them to}} establish, grow, and reproduce on floodplains – riparian vegetation guilds. Here I ask, what governs the distributions of groups of similar riparian plant species <b>across</b> <b>landscapes?</b> To answer this question, I identify relationships between riparian vegetation guilds and communities and environmental gradients across the American West. In Chapter One, I discuss guild-based classification in the context of community ecology and streams. In Chapter Two, I identified five woody riparian vegetation guilds across the interior Columbia and upper Missouri River Basins, USA, based on species’ traits and morphological attributes. I modeled guild occurrence across environmental gradients, including climate, disturbance, channel form attributes that reflect hydrology, and relationships between guilds. I found guilds’ distributions were related to hydrology, disturbance, and competitive or complementary interactions (niche partitioning) between co-occurring guilds. In Chapter Three, I examine floodplain riparian vegetation across the American West, identifying how hydrology, climate, and floodplain alteration shape riparian vegetation communities and their guilds. I identified eight distinct plant communities ranging from high elevation mixed conifer forests to gallery cottonwood forests to Tamarisk-dominated novel shrublands. I aggregated woody species into four guilds based on their traits and morphological attributes: an evergreen tree guild, a mesoriparian shrub guild, a mesoriparian tree guild, and a drought and hydrologic disturbance tolerant shrub guild. Communities and guilds’ distributions were governed by climate directly, and indirectly as mediated through streamflow. In Chapter Four, I discuss the utility of guild-based assessments of riparian vegetation, current limitations to these approaches, and potential future applications of the riparian vegetation guild concept to floodplain conservation and management. The classification of vegetation into functional trait-based guilds provides a flexible, framework from which to understand riparian biogeography, complementing other models frameworks for riparian vegetation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Modern {{landscape}} ecology {{is based on}} the patch mosaic paradigm, in which landscapes are conceptualized and analyzed as mosaics of discrete patches. While this model has been widely success-ful, there are many situations where it is more meaningful to model landscape structure based on continuous rather than discrete spatial heterogeneity. The growing field of surface metrology offers a variety of surface metrics for quantifying <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients,</b> yet these metrics are largely unknown and/ or unused by landscape ecologists. In this paper, we describe a suite of surface metrics with potential for landscape ecological application. We assessed the redundancy among metrics and sought to find groups of similarly behaved metrics by examining metric performance <b>across</b> 264 sample <b>landscapes</b> in western Turkey. For comparative purposes and to evaluate the robustness of the observed patterns, we examined 16 different patch mosaic models and 18 different <b>landscape</b> <b>gradient</b> models of <b>landscape</b> structure. Surface metrics were highly redundant, but less so than patch metrics, and consistently aggregated into four cohesive clusters of similarly behaved metrics representing surface roughness, shape of the surface height distribution, and angular and radial surface texture. While the surface roughness metrics have strong analogs among the patch metrics, the other surface components are largely unique to <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients.</b> We contend that the surface properties we identified are nearly universal and have potential to offer new insights into landscape pattern–process relationships...|$|R
40|$|Mycorrhizal fungi {{colonization}} can be {{a significant}} determinant of plant health and establishment success. By protecting roots from pathogens and increasing plant uptake of nutrients and water, mycorrhizal colonization can determine the outcome of competitive interactions between plants, thereby shaping plant community composition. Currently, in remnant forest patches, plants and their fungal symbionts are exposed to varied anthropomorphic effects related to the encroachment of metropolitan areas into rural landscapes. However, {{little is known about}} the impact of urbanization on the plant-mycorrhizal fungi association. To assess the effect of urbanization on mycorrhizal fungi root colonization and their role on seedling establishment, we investigated the relationship between mycorrhizal colonization of tree seedlings and seedling survival along an urbanization gradient typical of the mid-western region of the USA. We planted three species of temperate tree seedlings (Acer rubrum, Carya ovata, and Quercus rubra) in each of three landscape types: urban, suburban, and rural forests. We measured the percent of root length of the seedlings colonized by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and monitored seedling survival during their first growing season. We analyzed the percent root length colonized by mycorrhizae as a function of landscape type (urban-rural) and additional variables known to contribute mycorrhizal colonization (soil phosphorus, soil nitrogen, and initial plant height). We then analyzed seedling survival as a function of the degree of mycorrhizal fungi colonization associated with the <b>landscape</b> <b>gradient</b> and of additional environmental factors (available light and soil moisture). Within a species, we found no changes in levels of mycorrhizal fungi colonization <b>across</b> the urban <b>landscape</b> <b>gradient.</b> Environmental variables (light, soil moisture, soil nutrients) did not significantly vary along the urban gradient, and differences in these variables did not have a measureable effect upon mycorrhizal colonization or survival. Each seedling species had markedly different levels of colonization and responded differently to increasing levels of mycorrhizal colonization. For A. rubrum, survival was independent of mycorrhizal colonization, Q. rubra had a statistically non-significant rise in survival as colonization increased, and C. ovata had a significant positive survival response to more than 60 % colonization. These findings highlight the resilience of mycorrhizal communities across the rural-urban gradient and the potential sensitivity of some species to lower levels of mycorrhizal colonization...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{begins to}} {{differentiate}} the major drivers and chronology of erosion and aggradation in the fluvial and fluviokarst landscapes {{of the southern}} and central Maya Lowlands. We synthesize past research on erosion and aggradation and add new data from water, soils, radiocarbon dating, and archaeology to study the quantity, timing, and causes of aggradation in regional landscape depressions. Geomorphic findings come from many excavations <b>across</b> a <b>landscape</b> <b>gradient</b> from upland valleys, karst sinks, and fans into the coastal plain floodplains and depressions. Findings from water chemistry show that sources in the uplands have low quantities of dissolved ions but water in the coastal plains has high amounts of dissolved ions, often nearly saturated in calcium and sulfate. We found significant geomorphic complexity in the general trends in upland karst sinks. In a few instances, sediments preserve Late Pleistocene paleosols, buried 2 – 3 m, though many more have distinct middle to late Holocene paleosols, buried 1 – 2 m, after c. 2300 BP (Maya Early to Late Preclassic). From 2300 – 1100 BP (Late Preclassic to Classic Periods), the landscape aggraded from five main mechanisms: river flooding, climatic instability, accelerated erosion, ancient Maya landscape manipulation, and gypsum precipitation from a rise in a water table nearly saturated in calcium and sulfate ions. Evidence exists {{for two or three}} high magnitude floods, possibly driven by hurricanes. Moreover, lake-core and geophysical studies from the Petén Lakes region have shown high rates of deposition of silicate clays (‘Maya Clays’) starting and peaking during the Maya Preclassic and continuing to be high through the Late Classic. The main driver on upland karst depressions, the Petén lakes, upland valleys, and fans was accelerated soil erosion, but water table rise, probably driven by sea-level rise, was the main driver on the wetlands of the coastal plain because the aggraded sediments here are dominantly composed of gypsum, precipitated from the groundwater. This latter mechanism represents a little recognized mechanism of aggradation over a large region. These large scale environmental changes occurred during periods of intensive ancient Maya land use and climatic instability, both of which may have contributed to erosion by increasing runoff. Despite these geomorphic changes, ancient Maya farmers adapted in several key cases...|$|R
40|$|Human {{activities}} are leading to rapid environmental change globally and {{may affect the}} eco-evolutionary dynamics of species inhabiting human-dominated landscapes. Theory suggests that increases in environmental heterogeneity should promote variation in reproductive performance among individuals. At the same time, we know that novel environments, such as our urbanizing study system, may represent more benign or predictable environments due to resource subsidies and ecological changes. We tested the hypothesis that reduced environmental heterogeneity and enhanced resource availability in cities relax selective pressures on birds by testing if urban females vary less than rural females in their demographic contributions to local populations. From 2004 to 2014, we monitored local population densities and annual reproductive output of 470 female Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) breeding at 14 forested sites distributed <b>across</b> a rural-to-urban <b>landscape</b> <b>gradient</b> in Ohio, USA. Reproductive contribution was measured as the difference between individual and site-averaged annual reproductive output across all nesting attempts, divided by the annual density at each site. We show that among-individual variation in reproductive contribution to the next year's population declined with increasing urbanization, despite similar variability in body condition across the rural-urban gradient. Thus, female cardinals that bred in urban habitats within our study area were more similar in their contribution {{to the next generation}} than rural breeders, where a pattern of winners and losers was more evident. Within-individual variation in annual reproductive contribution also declined with increasing urbanization, indicating that performance of females was also more consistent among years in urban than rural landscapes. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that urbanized environments offer more homogeneous or predictable conditions that may buffer individuals from environmental heterogeneity and relax natural selection...|$|R

These include pollinating insects such as bumblebees, for which positive effects of AES on abundance and species richness have been shown. However, {{there is a lack of}} evidence for effects of AES on reproduction of target species, at either local or landscape scales. We conducted a large-scale study <b>across</b> <b>landscapes</b> exhibiting a <b>gradient</b> of agricultural intensity to investigate the effects of a targeted flower mixture, sown in patches of three different sizes, on an index of the total biomass of bumblebee sexuals (males and queens) on replicated transects within each landscape. We used this index (MQ) as a measure of bumblebee reproduction. After controlling for floral density on transects, we found that MQ was significantly higher on sown flower patches than on conventionally managed control patches at local scales throughout the three-year study. While sown flower patches did not significantly increase MQ in surrounding landscapes, MQ was higher in landscapes surrounding larger (1 ha) than smaller (0. 25 ha) sown patches. Our results suggest that, while responses of different bee species may vary depending on the plant species sown, targeted flower mixtures can enhance bumblebee reproduction by providing locally attractive forage resources to bumblebees of all castes and sexes from nests within foraging distance. If established at large enough scales, sown flower patches may lead to a detectable spill-over of reproductives into surrounding landscapes. Furthermore, effects of sown patches on MQ were moderated by landscape context, the strongest positive responses being detected at sites with high proportions of arable land. This supports previous findings that AES can deliver greater net benefits for pollinators in more intensively farmed landscapes...|$|R

While the impacts of major environmental gradients in soil nutrients, climate and topography on lowland {{tropical rain}} forest (TRF) structure and function have been extensively analyzed, {{the effects of the}} shorter environmental gradients typical of mesoscale TRF landscapes remain poorly understood. To evaluate multi-decadal performance of an old-growth TRF at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we established 18 0. 5 -ha annually-censused forest inventory plots in a stratified-random design <b>across</b> major <b>landscape</b> edaphic <b>gradients.</b> Over the 17 -year study period, there were moderate differences in stand dynamics and structure across these gradients but no detectable difference in woody productivity.

To extend the timeline to > 40 years, we combined our findings with those from earlier studies at this site. While there were annual to multiannual variations in the structure and dynamics, particularly in relation to local disturbances and the mega-Niño event, at the longer temporal scale and broader spatial scale this landscape was remarkably stable. This stability contrasts notably with a current hypothesis of increasing biomass and dynamics of TRF, which we term the Bigger and Faster Hypothesis (B&FHo). We consider possible reasons for the contradiction and conclude that it is currently not possible to independently assess the vast majority of previously published B&FHo evidence due to restricted data access...|$|R

The work on regime behavior is part of an overall study of the physical controls on regional patterns of Flow Duration Curves (FDCs), motivated by the fact that regime behavior leaves a major imprint upon the shape of FDCs, especially the slope of the FDCs. As an exercise in comparative hydrology, the paper seeks to assess the regime behavior of 428 catchments from the MOPEX database simultaneously, classifying and regionalizing them into homogeneous or hydrologically similar groups. A decision tree is developed {{on the basis of a}} metric chosen to characterize similarity of regime behavior, using a variant of the Iterative Dichotomiser (ID 3) algorithm to form a classification tree and associated catchment classes. In this way, several classes of catchments are distinguished, in which the connection between the catchments' regime behavior and climate and catchment properties becomes self-evident. Only four similarity indices are entered into the algorithm, all of which are obtained from smoothed daily regime curves of climatic variables and runoff. Results demonstrate that climate seasonality plays the most significant role in the classification of US catchments, with rainfall timing and climatic aridity index playing somewhat secondary roles in the organization of the catchments. In spite of the tremendous heterogeneity of climate, topography, and runoff behavior across the continental US, 331 of the 428 catchments studied are seen to fall into only six dominant classes...|$|R

This methodology was applied to a rural area of central Italy, using density indicators associated with urbanisation, agriculture, and natural elements considered to be key components for the identification of <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients.</b> The results highlight not only specific "pillar" landscapes, which are dominated by said components, but also transitional landscapes, where the most relevant forms of interaction between land uses were identified. Characterisation of landscape structures along the gradient illustrated different trends in patch density, shape complexity and landscape diversity, demonstrating greater variability in fringe areas than in pillar landscapes. PCA revealed a partial overlap between the main structural characteristics of the agro-forestry matrix and the medium intensity agricultural landscapes, whereas urban fringes and semi-natural fringes were clearly separated. The discovery of the continuous <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients</b> {{and an understanding of}} the gamut of landscape types nested along them is crucial in allowing for more effective land-use planning in which also fringe areas become a relevant part of the process...|$|R

Agri-environment schemes (AES) {{have been}} {{implemented}} across Europe, aiming to mitigate effects of habitat loss in agro-ecosystems {{for a range of}} declining species. These include pollinating insects such as bumblebees, for which positive effects of AES on abundance and species richness have been shown. However, {{there is a lack of}} evidence for effects of AES on reproduction of target species, at either local or landscape scales. We conducted a large-scale study <b>across</b> <b>landscapes</b> exhibiting a <b>gradient</b> of agricultural intensity to investigate the effects of a targeted flower mixture, sown in patches of three different sizes, on an index of the total biomass of bumblebee sexuals (males and queens) on replicated transects within each landscape. We used this index (MQ) as a measure of bumblebee reproduction. After controlling for floral density on transects, we found that MQ was significantly higher on sown flower patches than on conventionally managed control patches at local scales throughout the three-year study. While sown flower patches did not significantly increase MQ in surrounding landscapes, MQ was higher in landscapes surrounding larger (1. ha) than smaller (0. 25. ha) sown patches. Our results suggest that, while responses of different bee species may vary depending on the plant species sown, targeted flower mixtures can enhance bumblebee reproduction by providing locally attractive forage resources to bumblebees of all castes and sexes from nests within foraging distance. If established at large enough scales, sown flower patches may lead to a detectable spill-over of reproductives into surrounding landscapes. Furthermore, effects of sown patches on MQ were moderated by landscape context, the strongest positive responses being detected at sites with high proportions of arable land. This supports previous findings that AES can deliver greater net benefits for pollinators in more intensively farmed landscapes.

40|$|A palaeolimnological {{study of}} three lakes on Disko Island, West Greenland was {{conducted}} <b>across</b> a hydrogeomorphic <b>landscape</b> <b>gradient,</b> to reconstruct principally changes in algal pigments, lipid biomarkers and carbon isotopes (δ 13 C) to investigate carbon cycling at multiple scales and resolutions. All three records reconstructed recent change on Disko, with records from lake Disko 2 additionally spanning since 7640 cal. yr BP and lake Disko 4 since 1260 cal. yr BP. Changes in sedimentary proxies were broadly {{consistent with the}} spatially and temporally heterogeneous environmental change known to have occurred across the Arctic over these periods, including recent warming (RW), the Little Ice Age (LIA) and the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA). However, the individual lake responses to these changes were highly landscape specific. Changes in algal pigments were linked to variations in the inputs of nutrients and DOC from soil microbial activity, variations in permafrost melt regime and glacier melt. Evidence of disturbance from catchment freeze-thaw processes, glacier inputs {{and the effects of}} permafrost melt on algal communities varied between lakes. At the highest position in the <b>landscape</b> <b>gradient,</b> lake Disko 2 had poorly developed soils and lower glacier coverage, with simple algal communities, but pigment and δ 13 CTOC changes since 7640 cal. yr BP reflected individualistic responses to overarching drivers, consistent with the current understanding of heterogeneous pan-Arctic environmental change. Replicate cores with proximity to talus and debris flow had differing signatures, highlighting the role of geomorphology. In lake Disko 2 there was some similarity between Greenland Ice Sheet surface area and pigment biomarkers of cryptophytes (alloxanthin), which suggests if locally similar, catchment ice variation may regulate nutrient and DOC release from catchments, stimulating algae. At a mid-elevation position in the catchment, lake Disko 1 meltwater inputs from an upstream retreating glacier (since the end of the LIA) may be stimulating algae through increased nutrients and DOC supply, although soil nutrient cycling and permafrost release present in the catchment U-shaped valley may also be contributing to these increases. At the lowest position in the landscape, lake Disko 4 has a complex and variable pigment response likely influenced by multiple glacier inputs, thicker permafrost, greater vegetation and more developed wetland areas, together regulating the cycling of nutrients and DOC. Higher maximum pigment concentration during the MCA, compared with the LIA reflect the spatially and temporally heterogeneous expression of these events across the Arctic. Despite individuality in catchment filtering, all three lakes on Disko Island were found to have recent increases in algal production, which when combined with recent increases in carbon burial suggests these lakes are becoming increased carbon sinks. Although this increased carbon burial reflects a minor store in lakes compared with release to downstream waterbodies, if upscaled across the Arctic this change could be globally significant and should be integrated in future models. With future warming, catchment processes are likely to play a pronounced role in mediating algal community structure in lakes across the Arctic...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{test whether}} {{functional}} homogenization of bird communities is promoted by anthropogenic landscape transformation, using specialization and habitat pref- erence indices {{that account for}} the multidimensionality of niches. Location Catalonia, north-east Iberian Peninsula. Methods We used data on bird species occurrences and landscape features in 2834 1 -km 2 squares. Three orthogonal <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients,</b> which were taken as niche dimensions, were defined by means of principal components analysis (PCA). Specialization and habitat preference indices were created for 103 terrestrial bird species {{on the basis of}} their frequency of occurrence variation along the <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients.</b> These indices, together with species rarity, were then averaged for bird communities. We then analysed the patterns of variation of communities’ mean specialization, mean rarity and mean habitat preference values along a gradient of agricultural–forest habitat mosaics. Results Wherever we found a significant variation in the degree of specialization along the agricultural–forest gradient, agricultural habitats held more specialized bird communities than did forest ones and bore, on average, rarer species. Thus, results contradicted our initial hypothesis that humanized areas would bear more functionally homogenized bird communities. Higher a-diversity values tended to be associated with generalist communities and with those having rarer species. Main conclusions Estimations of bird community specialization for different niche dimensions can behave differently along certain <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients,</b> and some of these differences can be explained by the variation of mean habitat pref- erences. Thus, we argue that a multidimensional approach to assess average niche breadth of communities can be more informative than a unidimensional measure. Our results suggest that widespread land abandonment and current secondary forest expansion throughout the Mediterranean area are promoting functional homogenization of bird communities. It would be desirable to construct larger- scale indicators of functional homogenization in order to monitor communities’ responses to widespread landscape changesPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Aim To {{examine the}} {{distributional}} patterns of vertebrates (including birds, bats, carnivores and lagomorphs) along landscape composition and configuration gradients {{to better understand}} the effects of landscape modification on occurrence patterns at both species and community level. Location The region of Alentejo, a forest-dominated area of southern Portugal. Methods The study area was framed using 1647 hexagonal plots, each of 259 ha in size. Composition and configuration gradients were obtained for each plot by integrating the proportions of the main land cover types and their configuration patterns using multivariate analyses. Species-specific vertebrate responses were investigated using data from 75 plots in which carnivores, bats and lagomorphs were sampled, and from 135 plots in the case of birds. Community- level responses were investigated through changes in species richness and beta-diversity in 57 plots where all vertebrate groups were simultaneously sampled. At the species-level, an information-theoretic approach was used {{to determine the effects of}} <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients</b> on species’ responses. At the community level, Mantel tests were used to determine between-plot differences in species composition using the Sørensen dissimilarity index. Results We found that the occurrence patterns of most vertebrate species were best predicted by composition-related gradients, although configuration gradients were also frequently included in species-specific occurrence models. We also found a weak correlation between species richness and most <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients</b> suggesting a turnover in the identity of species, something that was corroborated by the stronger correlation between environmental gradients and beta-diversity measures. The amount of forest cover and landscape complexity (estimated as the heterogeneity in the size and number of land cover types) were the main composition and configuration gradients determining vertebrate responses at both species and community level. Main conclusions Our work contributes to a more refined understanding of the mechanisms underlying species distributional patterns in real-world human-modified landscapes. By uncovering generalities of species with multiple ecological requirements and by describing the entire landscape mosaic through <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients,</b> we also suggest that our work greatly helps to fill the gap between existing conceptual landscape models aimed to understand species distributional patterns in human-modified landscapes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract There {{has been}} a recent trend in genetic studies of wild populations where {{researchers}} have changed their sampling schemes from sampling pre-defined populations to sampling individuals uniformly <b>across</b> <b>landscapes.</b> This {{reflects the fact that}} many species under study are contin-uously distributed rather than clumped into obvious ‘‘populations’’. Once individual samples are collected, many landscape genetic studies use clustering algorithms and multilocus genetic data to group samples into sub-populations. After clusters are derived, landscape features that may be acting as barriers are examined and described. In theory, if populations were evenly sampled, this course of action should reliably identify population structure. However, genetic gradients and irregularly collected sam-ples may impact the composition and location of clusters. We built genetic models where individual genotypes were either randomly distributed <b>across</b> a <b>landscape</b> or contained <b>gradients</b> created by neighbor mating for multiple genera-tions. We investigated the influence of six different sampling protocols on population clustering using program STRUCTURE, the most commonly used model-based clustering method for multilocus genotype data. For mod-els where individuals (and their alleles) were randomly distributed <b>across</b> a <b>landscape,</b> STRUCTURE correctly predicted that only one population was being sampled. However, when gradients created by neighbor mating existed, STRUCTURE detected multiple, but different numbers of clusters, depending on sampling protocols. We recommend testing for fine scale autocorrelation patterns prior to sample clustering, as the scale of the autocorrelation appears to influence the results. Further, we recommend that researchers pay attention to the impacts that sampling may have on subsequent population and landscape genetic results...|$|R
40|$|Different {{components}} of global change can have interacting effects on biodiversity {{and this may}} influence our ability to detect the specific consequences of climate change through biodiversity indicators. Here, we analyze whether climate change indicators can be affected by land use dynamics that are not directly determined by climate change. To this aim, we analyzed three community-level indicators of climate change impacts {{that are based on}} the optimal thermal environment and average latitude of the distribution of bird species present at local communities. We used multiple regression models to relate the variation in climate change indicators to: i) environmental temperature; and ii) three <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients</b> reflecting important current land use change processes (land abandonment, fire impacts and urbanization), all of them having forest areas at their positive extremes. We found that, with few exceptions, <b>landscape</b> <b>gradients</b> determined the figures of climate change indicators as strongly as temperature. Bird communities in forest habitats had colder-dwelling bird species with more northern distributions than farmland, burnt or urban areas. Our results show that land use changes can reverse, hide or exacerbate our perception of climate change impacts when measured through community-level climate change indicators. We stress the need of an explicit incorporation of the interactions between climate change and land use dynamics to understand what ar...|$|R
