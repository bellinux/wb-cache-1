As railroads extended inland from port cities like Boston, wharves became locations for transfer of freight and new marketplaces were built near population centers.

40|$|The Perdido and Wolf Bay {{system in}} Alabama, USA, is an estuarine system linking the {{freshwater}} from the Perdido and Wolf Bay watersheds and the tidal saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico through Perdido Pass, Dolphin Pass, and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. A three dimensional hydrodynamic model using Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) {{was developed and}} used to analyze complex and dynamic flow, salinity, and temperature distributions in the system. The external driving forces for the model include the river discharges from natural and urban watersheds, atmospheric winds, and astronomical tidal elevations at the open boundaries where flow exchange takes place. Simulated water surface elevation, temperature, and salinity were compared against the field data at several observation stations in 2008 and 2009 with good agreement (coefficient of determination R 2 = 0. 92 between the measured and the modeled water surface elevations). The calibrated EFDC model {{was used to examine}} responses of the system to high, mean, and low inflows from streams and the sea level rise in the open boundaries under climate change. The concept of the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> was applied to understand pollutant transport in the system.

The <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is less than 20 days under the 2 -year high inflows and up to 160 days under 7 Q 10 low inflows. Under mean inflow conditions, the age of the tracer released from Wolf Bay is 50 – 70 days in the lower Perdido Bay and larger than that in the upper Perdido Bay, indicating a strong interaction between tides and inflows, which results in recirculation of flow and pollutants.

40|$|It {{has been}} widely theorized that water age may be a useful {{indicator}} {{of the quality of}} water within drinking water distribution networks. However, there is limited evidence of model simulation results being related to empirical water quality (WQ) data to substantiate the theory. This paper presents the findings of investigations designed to determine if there was an observable relationship between mean water ages calculated using a WQ simulation model, and measured WQ in two live distribution networks. The <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in all pipes was calculated using Aquis hydraulic and WQ modeling software. Historic regulatory WQ data was examined to determine if there was a relationship between general WQ and calculated water age within the networks. A more detailed study was then undertaken in one network by translating model locations that were representative of the spread of water age into real-world locations. WQ samples were taken intensively from these sites and analyzed for a range of aesthetic, physical, chemical, and bacteriological parameters indicative of general WQ. Some relationship between the calculated mean <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and the general WQ in the network was demonstrated. Analysis that considered calculated water age and associated WQ along unperturbed flow routes through the network produced a stronger relationship. Given that regulatory WQ within the study networks as reported to the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) was 99. 9 percent compliant, this relationship was deemed noteworthy. ...|$|E

Radon samples collected below the tidal wedge were not in equilibrium with the production rate, suggesting vertical mixing across the base of the tidal wedge. The <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> ranged from up to 8. 0 d landward of the high water mark to less than 2. 0 d in the littoral zone.

However, a mass balance for water in the tidal wedge was significantly greater, 3. 0 6 0. 5 d. The difference was most likely due to evasion of radon from wet, unsaturated sediments.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} a {{treatise}} of {{the quantity and}} quality aspects of potable water in distribution systems. The privatisation of the UK Water Industry in 1989 has seen the requirement for the Water Companies in England and Wales to be responsible for the delivery of good quality water that meets the demand of all consumers. In respect of the quantity of supply, there have been many previous studies that have examined the hydraulic performance of distribution systems and there are now many proprietary mathematical models that have been successfully used in this study. However, in respect of water quality the literature review has highlighted that the modelling approach is not so well advanced, as water quality is a function of many concepts, processes and parameters that include the source and <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> the condition and deterioration of the assets in the system, the microbiological, chemical and physical processes and the network hydraulic performance, including pressure transients. These processes are highly interactive and complex.

A comparison between the predictions made using the barotropic mode and the baroclinic mode has been undertaken in the above two estuaries.

Groundwater becomes an important and safe source of water when surficial bodies are intermittent and affected by natural and anthropogenic contamination.

The WFIUH can in fact be used to estimate the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> but this age often deviates from the age found in tracer studies (Rigon et al., 2016). Efforts were made to include estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) to improve estimates of travel time distributions (Botter et al., 2011), which has proven valuable for hydrochemical models in temperate lowlands (Benettin et al., 2013). However, storm runoff predictions for environments dominated by Hortonian runoff {{such as those in}} the Mediterranean Region will not necessarily improve by accounting for ET because most water never infiltrates during the initial stage of a storm (Andrieux et al., 1996).
