5|$|According to JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue), an American named Len Ross was {{initially}} booked {{to direct the}} film; Ross was reportedly {{in the country to}} film a work entitled Java for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and shot several scenes in mid-1928. The cast was ethnic Chinese, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> stars– Lie Lian Hwa and Lie Bo Tan– were reportedly daughters of the Surabayan gangster Lie Bauw Kie and trained in silat; other cast members included Kwee Tiang An and Yah Kwee Pang. However, after Ross withdrew the script was put on hold.|$|E

5|$|At the Battle of Essling, Moustache was {{supposed}} to have found a mate. Upon joining the front lines, a fellow Poodle was spotted amongst the enemy. During the course of the battle, the two met <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> Poodle accompanied Moustache back to the French camp. This relationship lasted about a year and together the pair produced puppies which were looked after by the women of the camp.|$|E

5|$|Female okapis become {{sexually mature}} at about one-and-a-half years old, while males reach {{maturity}} after two years. Rut in males and estrus in females {{does not depend}} on the season. In captivity, estrus cycles recur every 15 days. The male <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> begin courtship by circling, smelling and licking each other. The male shows his dominance by extending his neck, tossing his head and protruding one leg forward. This is followed by mounting and copulation.|$|E
5|$|Following the urgings of Superintendent George {{and various}} {{official}} enquiries, new workshops were built to provide increased useful employment for prisoners. The western workshops, located between the entry complex <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Female</b> Division, were built from 1900–1901 of squared limestone rubble with openings dressed in brick. An open saw-tooth roof with southern skylights covered the five spaces {{designed for the}} five traditional workshops: tailors, bookbinders, shoemakers, mat makers and painters. The two northern shops were later amalgamated by removing the dividing wall.|$|E
5|$|Other {{arthropods}} {{may make}} use of the antlion larva's ability to trap prey. The larva of the Australian horsefly (Scaptia muscula) lives in antlion (for example Myrmeleon pictifrons) pit traps and feeds on the prey caught, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> chalcid wasp (Lasiochalcidia igiliensis) purposefully allows itself to be trapped so that it can parasitise the antlion larva by ovipositing between its head and thorax.|$|E

5|$|Several {{critics have}} made exactly the {{opposite}} interpretation, reading the poem as a comic critique of the Christianity of the time, particularly as embodied in the Christian chivalry of Arthur's court. In its zeal to extirpate all traces of paganism, Christianity had cut itself off from the sources of life in nature <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> The green girdle represents all the pentangle lacks. The Arthurian enterprise is doomed unless it can acknowledge the unattainability of {{the ideals of the}} Round Table, and, for the sake of realism and wholeness, recognize and incorporate the pagan values represented by the Green Knight.|$|E
5|$|The Girl {{is based}} on Donald Spoto's 2009 book, Spellbound by Beauty: Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading Ladies, which {{examines}} the relationships between Alfred Hitchcock <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> stars of his films. Spoto wrote that Hitchcock attempted to turn Tippi Hedren (star of The Birds and Marnie) into his perfect woman, choosing the clothes and lipstick he thought she should wear. Hedren told Spoto that Hitchcock fantasised about running off with her.|$|E
5|$|The New Guinean magpie, G. tibicen papuana, is {{a little-known}} {{subspecies}} found in southern New Guinea. The adult male has a mostly white {{back with a}} narrow black stripe, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> a blackish back; the black feathers here are tipped with white similar to subspecies dorsalis. It has a long deep bill resembling that of subspecies longirostris. Genetically it {{is closely related to}} a western lineage of Australian magpies comprising subspecies dorsalis, longirostris and eylandtensis, suggesting their ancestors occupied in savannah country that was a land bridge between New Guinea and Australia and was submerged around 16,500 years ago.|$|E

5|$|The male then {{leads the}} female to {{potential}} nest sites, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> will choose one. The female dove builds the nest. The male will fly about, gather material, {{and bring it}} to her. The male will stand on the female's back and give the material to the female, who then builds it into the nest. The nest is constructed of twigs, conifer needles, or grass blades, and is of flimsy construction. Mourning doves will sometimes requisition the unused nests of other mourning doves, other birds, or arboreal mammals such as squirrels.|$|E

5|$|This species {{appears to}} have been confounded with C.distans; and from Lightfoot's {{description}} of the green angles of the fruit, I presume it to have been what he intended under that name. It is considerably larger than the real distans, the spikes black intermixed with green rather than yellowish, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> ones often branched or compounded at their base. Its most essential and decisive character however consists in the two strong deep-green nerves or ribs which run along each side of the fruit externally near the edge. The arillus is also broader and more compressed than in C.distans.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most James Bond films {{featuring}} {{various locations}} around the world, almost the entire film is set in one country and several minutes are devoted to an elaborate Japanese wedding. This {{is in keeping with}} Fleming's original novel, which also devoted a number of pages to the discussion of Japanese culture. Toho Studios provided soundstages, personnel, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> Japanese stars to the producers.|$|E
5|$|Adult non-breeding plumage is {{brownish}} {{with a dark}} {{neck and}} head marked with dark grey-brown. The eyes are surrounded with white, and the eyelids are pale. The bill is mostly pale grey, with a dark culmen and tip, but in early spring the tip may turn whitish. The underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are also whitish. The foreneck is whitish, usually forming wedge-shaped notch in dark neck-sides, and may sometimes reveal a shadowy trace of the neck ring or a pale collar. It has dark brownish grey upperparts with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders and some wing coverts spotted with white, which are usually concealed while swimming. The male <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> have similar appearances, although they exhibit sexual dimorphism in their physical dimensions with the male larger and significantly heavier than the female.|$|E

5|$|After {{copulation}} it {{is generally}} the male who gathers sticks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> that constructs the loosely woven nest. The nest is subsequently covered with (and cemented by) guano. Frigatebirds prefer to nest in trees or bushes, though when these are not available they will nest on the ground. A single white egg that weighs up to 6–7% of mother's body mass is laid, and is incubated in turns by both birds for 41 to 55 days. The altricial chicks are naked on hatching and develop a white down. They are continuously guarded by the parents for the first 4–6 weeks and are fed on the nest for 5–6 months. Both parents take turns feeding {{for the first three}} months, after which the male's attendance tails off leaving the mother to feed the young for another six to nine months on average. The chicks feed by reaching their heads in their parents' throat and eating the part-regurgitated food. It takes so long to rear a chick that frigatebirds generally breed every other year.|$|E
5|$|After the October Tour, U2 decamped to {{a rented}} cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical {{breakthroughs}} were {{achieved by the}} Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December.|$|E
5|$|Among harem-holding species, {{the adult}} females mate only with their harem stallion, while in other species, mating is more {{promiscuous}} and the males have larger testes for sperm competition. Estrous in female equines lasts 5–10 days; physical signs include frequent urination, flowing muscus, and a swollen, everted labia. In addition, estrous females will stand with their hind legs spread {{and raise their}} tails when {{in the presence of}} a male. Males assess the female's reproductive state with the flehmen response <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> will solicit mating by backing in. Length of gestation varies by species, it is roughly 11 to 13 months, and most mares will come into estrus again within a few days after foaling, depending on conditions. Usually, only a single foal is born, which is capable of running within an hour. Within a few weeks, foals will attempt to graze, but may continue to nurse for 8–13 months. Species in arid habitats, like the Grévy's zebra, have longer nursing intervals and do not drink water until they are three months old.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the end of}} summer, {{the queen}} {{produces}} both male wasps and fertile female wasps. These progeny then mate with wasps from other colonies, <b>and</b> then <b>the</b> <b>females</b> find secure locations {{in which they can}} reside during the winter. At this point, the colonies begin to deteriorate, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> start their own colonies the following spring.|$|R
