The UNISERVO drive recording medium was a thin metal strip of 0.5 in wide nickel-plated phosphor bronze. Recording density was 128 characters per inch (198 micrometre/character) on eight tracks at <b>a</b> <b>linear</b> <b>speed</b> of 100 in/s m/s, yielding a data rate of 12,800 characters per second. Of the eight tracks, six were data, one was a parity track, and one was a clock, or timing track. Making allowance for the empty space between tape blocks, the actual transfer rate was around 7,200 characters per second. A small reel of mylar tape provided separation from the metal tape and the read/write head.|$|E

Separation efficiency in a centrifuge depends on weight difference. Separation of uranium isotopes requires a centrifuge that can spin at 1,500 revolutions per second (90,000 RPM). If we assume a rotor diameter of 20 cm (actual rotor diameter {{is likely to be}} less), this corresponds to <b>a</b> <b>linear</b> <b>speed</b> of greater than Mach 2 (Mach 1 = 340 m/s). For comparison, automatic washing machines operate at only about 12 to 25 revolutions per second (720-1500 RPM) during the spin cycle, while turbines in automotive turbochargers can run up to around 2500-3333 revolutions per second (150,000-200,000 RPM).|$|E
5000|$|As the star's core collapses, its {{rotation}} rate increases {{as a result}} of conservation of angular momentum, hence newly formed neutron stars rotate at up to several hundred times per second. Some neutron stars emit beams of electromagnetic radiation that make them detectable as pulsars. Indeed, the discovery of pulsars in 1967 was the first observational suggestion that neutron stars exist. The radiation from pulsars is thought to be primarily emitted from regions near their magnetic poles. If the magnetic poles do not coincide with the rotational axis of the neutron star, the emission beam will sweep the sky, and when seen from a distance, if the observer is somewhere {{in the path of the}} beam, it will appear as pulses of radiation coming from a fixed point in space (the so-called [...] "lighthouse effect"). The fastest-spinning neutron star known is PSR J1748-2446ad, rotating at a rate of 716 times a second or 43,000 revolutions per minute, giving <b>a</b> <b>linear</b> <b>speed</b> at the surface on the order of [...] (i.e. nearly a quarter the speed of light).|$|E

5000|$|In pre-rendered {{computer}} animation, such as CGI movies, realistic {{motion blur}} {{can be drawn}} because the renderer has more time to draw each frame. Temporal anti-aliasing produces frames as a composite of many instants. Frames are not points in time, they are periods of time. If an object makes a trip at <b>a</b> <b>linear</b> <b>speed</b> along a path from 0% to 100% in four time periods, and if those time periods are considered frames, then the object would exhibit motion blur streaks in each frame that are 25% of the path length. If the shutter speed is shortened to less than the duration of a frame, {{and it may be}} so shortened as to approach zero time in duration, then the computer animator must choose which portion of the quarter paths (in our 4 frame example) they wish to feature as [...] "open shutter" [...] times. They may choose to render the beginnings of each frame, in which case they will never see the arrival of the object {{at the end of the}} path, or they may choose to render the ends of each frame, in which case they will miss the starting point of the trip. Most computer animations systems make the classic [...] "fence-post error" [...] in the way they handle time, confusing the periods of time of an animation with the instantaneous moments that delimit them. Thus most computer animation systems will incorrectly place an object on a four frame trip along a path at 0%, 0.33%, 0.66%, and 1.0% and when called upon to render motion blur will have to cut one or more frames short, or look beyond the boundaries of the animation, compromises that real cameras don't do and synthetic cameras needn't do.|$|E

The microcontroller used is PIC 18 F 4520 and its output is used to drive Futaba RC servo motors directly.

For our experiments we use TIMBL, an implementation of the k-NN classifier that uses a decision-tree structure for retrieving nearest neigbors, and that employs feature weighting. While the first method consistently scales linearly, with the second method we observe cases of both superlinear and sublinear scaling. Analysis shows that superlinear scaling can occur with datasets of which the feature weights exhibit a low variance; retrieval of nearest neighbors from the tree structure becomes exponentially slower with more data. Hence, the retrieval of classifications from m subclassifier decision structures based on 1 /mth parts of the training set can be substantially more than m times faster. ...|$|E
