5|$|In the lead-up to the visit, the American Friends of Vietnam (AFV) {{engaged in}} a promotional {{campaign}} encouraging newspapers to cover Diệm's visit and imploring them to give the South Vietnamese president favourable coverage. The AFV also drafted many of Diệm's speeches, making sure that there were analogies made between South Vietnam and various events in American history, {{so that he would}} make a good impression on the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> decision-makers. For this purpose they employed the services of the political consultancy firm Harold Oram.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to files}} {{recovered}} by Fisher in London (and made public by the president), the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> Congress both believe that Iran is funding the Blacklist, and The United States and Iran are headed towards war. Looking for more solid proof of Iran's involvement, Fisher infiltrates Quds Force headquarters in Tehran(previously a U.S embassy). Inside, he discovers that Iran {{has nothing to}} do with the Blacklist, and that the files he recovered were planted by The Engineers in order to lure The United States into a war. Fisher narrowly escapes Tehran by using a Predator Drone to blow up the Iranian vehicles chasing him, causing an international incident.|$|E

5|$|One poll {{reported}} in the journal Nature showed that among American scientists (across various disciplines), about 40 percent believe in both evolution and an active deity (theistic evolution). This {{is similar to the}} results reported for surveys of the general American public. Also, about 40 percent of the scientists polled believe in a God that answers prayers, and believe in immortality. While about 55% of scientists surveyed were atheists, agnostics, or nonreligious theists, atheism is far from universal among scientists who support evolution, or among the general public that supports evolution. Very similar results were reported from a 1997 Gallup Poll of the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> scientists.|$|E
5|$|Other {{countries}} considered similar memorials. The US {{constructed a}} Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in 1921; while {{the idea was}} clearly a foreign concept, it proved very popular with the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> by 1936 was attracting over 1.5 m visitors a year and acting as an informal national monument to the war. Edwin Redslob, part of the German government, supported a similar scheme in 1925, but without success, and Mainz Cathedral and Ulm Minster were later proposed as options for a tomb. In Germany, a tomb was not finally built until 1935, when it {{was sponsored by the}} Nazi government; the final memorial contained 20 bodies of unknown German soldiers from the Eastern front. Other countries also constructed tombs, including Belgium and Portugal, and as in France and Britain these tombs were placed in capital cities; there was an abortive attempt to place the Romanian tomb at Mărăşeşti, but this proved impractical for both logistic and ceremonial reasons. Canada, Australia and New Zealand declined to build their own tombs, as they were considered to be represented by the burial in London.|$|E
5|$|At the {{strategic}} level the general uprising never eventuated, and in late-February the communist offensive collapsed after suffering more than 45,000 killed, against South Vietnamese and allied losses of 6,000 men. Regardless, {{it proved to}} be {{a turning point in the}} war and although it had been a tactical disaster for the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong, Hanoi emerged with a significant political victory as confidence in the American military and political leadership collapsed, as did public support for the war in the United States. Prior to Tet, American commanders and politicians had talked confidently about winning the war, arguing that General William Westmoreland's strategy of attrition had reached the point where the communists were losing soldiers and equipment faster than they could be replaced. Yet the scale of the offensive, and the surprise and violence with which it had been launched, had shocked the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> contradicted such predictions of imminent victory; in its wake President Lyndon Johnson announced that he would no longer seek a second term in office. Tet had a similar effect on Australian public opinion, and caused growing uncertainty in the government about the determination of the United States to remain militarily involved in Southeast Asia. Amid the initial shock, Prime Minister John Gorton unexpectedly declared that Australia would not increase its military commitment in Vietnam beyond the current level of 8,000 personnel.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of their {{frequent}} use by schoolchildren, many school districts banned the toy. Some teachers argued that the spinners distracted students from their schoolwork. According to a survey conducted by Alexi Roy and published in May 2017, 32% of the largest 200 <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> private high schools had banned spinners on campus.|$|E
25|$|While the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> {{leadership}} {{were not}} ready for war, the path to an eventual declaration of war had been set {{as a result of}} the sinking of the Lusitania. On 19 August U-24 sank the White Star liner , with the loss of 44 passengers and crew, three of whom were American. The German government, while insisting on the legitimacy of its campaign against Allied shipping, disavowed the sinking of the Arabic; it offered an indemnity and pledged to order submarine commanders to abandon unannounced attacks on merchant and passenger vessels.|$|E

25|$|The Zimmermann Telegram was a 1917 {{diplomatic}} {{proposal from}} the German Empire for Mexico to join {{an alliance with}} Germany {{in the event of}} the United States entering World War I against Germany. The proposal was intercepted and decoded by British intelligence. Revelation of the contents outraged the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> swayed public opinion. President Woodrow Wilson moved to arm American merchant ships in order to defend themselves against German submarines, which had started to attack them. The news helped generate support for the United States declaration of war on Germany in April of that year.|$|E

500|$|The uncontested {{surrender}} of Ticonderoga caused an uproar in the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> in its military circles, as Ticonderoga was {{widely believed to}} be virtually impregnable, and a vital point of defence. [...] General St. Clair and his superior, General Philip Schuyler, were vilified by Congress. [...] Both were eventually exonerated in courts martial, but their careers were adversely affected. [...] Schuyler had already lost his command to Horatio Gates {{by the time of}} the court martial, and St. Clair held no more field commands for the remainder of the war.|$|E

Coward won an Academy Honorary Award in 1943 for his naval film drama, In Which We Serve, and was knighted in 1969.

500|$|The music {{industry}} in Memphis had {{large role in}} bringing bands {{to the attention of}} the <b>American</b> <b>public,</b> <b>and</b> in the 1960s, many British bands, among them the Beatles, aspired to emulate the sounds of Memphis musicians including Elvis Presley—without whom, according to Lennon, [...] "there would not have been the Beatles". The sudden popularity of the Beatles, and the British Invasion triggered by their arrival, became a major new influence in the United States, which not only established the popularity of British bands, but also affected the musical style of U.S. bands—including those subsequently formed in Memphis.|$|E

Cao said he had declined Khiêm's invitation, mildly mocking him by asking [...] "You're part of the 'Troika' now ... won't you be overthrowing yourself?" [...] Cao said he had pointed out that political upheaval in Saigon would {{be a bad idea}} because Vietnam was prominent during the ongoing US presidential election campaign and negative publicity could lead to a decrease in <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> political support for South Vietnam.|$|E

500|$|Joseph Redding {{defended his}} clients vigorously. [...] His {{argument}} was three-fold. [...] First {{he argued that}} in one hundred years of Indian policy, Congress had never prosecuted Indian-on-Indian crime. [...] Further, the indictment as stated contained no element of commerce and was therefore outside the purview of Congress to legislate such a law. [...] Finally, he argued that such a profound shift in Indian policy should not be enacted in a law whose heading and body were wholly inconsistent {{with the intent of}} the Major Crimes Act. [...] In effect, he argued that such a law governing a people should be debated in full sight of the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> on its own merits. [...] Redding argued that Congress could not assert power over sovereign people who, when making treaties to cede land, reserved certain rights to themselves. [...] He did not raise the issue that the tribes already did have a system of law that dealt with crimes against another person.|$|E

[...] He stated that the United States [...] "was charging towards world domination while the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> Britain's 'mass-murdering' prime minister sat back and watched." [...] He was very active in the antiwar movement in the United Kingdom, speaking at rallies held by the Stop the War Coalition and frequently criticising American aggression, as when he asked rhetorically, in his acceptance speech for the Wilfred Owen Award for Poetry on 18 March 2007: [...] "What would Wilfred Owen make of the invasion of Iraq? A bandit act, an act of blatant state terrorism, demonstrating absolute contempt for the conception of international law." ...|$|E
