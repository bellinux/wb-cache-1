40|$|Background: Transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) {{constitute}} a major health problem worldwide where routine screening of blood or blood products is improperly done, and where non-medical injecting medications and/or drug use are prevalent. Prevalence and risk factors vary by geographic location {{and by the}} specific TTI (including HIV- 1, HBV, HCV and HTLV-I). Objective: To determine theprevalence and risk factors associated with TTIs among a sample of multi-transfused adult patients in Peru. Study design: A cross-sectionalmulti-center study was conducted across seven major hospitals in Peru from February 2003 to September 2004. Self-reported behavior information (medical procedures, number of sexual partners, and drug use history) was analyzed, along with a review of exposure history from hospital medical records. Prevalences were calculated by TTI for different exposures, along with unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for infection risk. Results: Overall, 192 (54. 7 %) of 351 multi-transfused patients were found infected {{with one or more}} TTIs. Number of <b>transfusion</b> <b>units,</b> years of <b>transfusion</b> history (6 or more), and number of treatment facilities (2 or more) were associated with HCV infection.

Patients undergoing hip arthroplasty were studied with blood sampling for alanine aminotransferase analysis before and at 2, 3, and 4 months after transfusion. Of the patients 97 % and 82 % were transfused and received a mean of 5. 5 and 3. 4 units in Linkoping and Oskarshamn, respectively. None of 38 patients in Oskarshamn but 4 of 144 patients (2. 8 %) in Linkoping contracted PTH-NANB. Two of these four patients developed antibodies against hepatitis C virus (HCV) by the first-generation anti-HCV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (C 100). The other two patients remained negative by this test. HCV infection was, however, indicated in all four patients by positive second-generation anti-HCV ELISA confirmed by positive second-generation recombinant immunoblot assay (4 -RIBA). Three of the patients were positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Serum from one blood donor to the four hepatitis patients (altogether three donors) was found positive by first- and second-generation anti-HCV ELISA and 4 -RIBA and was also PCR-positive. Three other blood donors, who did not transmit hepatitis, were anti-HCV ELISA (C 100) -positive.

40|$|The {{present report}} {{contains}} {{the data collected}} in 2007, pursuant to Section 21 German Transfusion Act, and {{an analysis of the}} supply situation over the past 8 years. As in previous years, all blood donation centres located in Germany transmitted data on the collection, manufacture, import and export of blood components for transfusion. According to these data, a total of 6. 7 million blood collections were performed in 2007. With 4. 7 million, the portion of whole blood donations was at the level of previous years, whereas the number of apheresis donations rose again, to 1. 9 million. The portion of autologous blood collections accounts for only 1. 1 % and thus continues to decline. Since 2003, the number of red blood cell concentrates prepared has been a constant 4. 5 million <b>transfusion</b> <b>units.</b> The decay of red blood cell concentrates on the user side in 2000 accounted for 5 % while in 2007 it was just above 3 %, referred to the total quantity of data reported as transfused and decayed. The manufacture of platelet concentrates rose from 366, 000 to 480, 000 <b>transfusion</b> <b>units</b> between 2003 and 2007. The production of therapeutic single plasmas, too, markedly increased in 2007 (to 1. 2 million <b>transfusion</b> <b>units).</b> In 2007, 2. 2 million I of plasma for fractionation were collected in Germany. In addition, 1. 0 million I were imported, and 1. 8 million I were exported. The quantity available in Germany from a pure arithmetic point of view of 1. 4 million I was almost entirely allocated to basic fractionation so that a sufficient plasma supply can be assumed. Due to the fact that manufacturing capacities are still lacking in Germany, recombinant factors need to be imported in their entirety. Since 2003, Germany has by far been the leader in Europe with more than 20 I of fractionation plasma collected per 1, 000 inhabitants. Furthermore, regarding the manufacturing figures of red blood cell concentrates, platelet concentrates, and therapeutic single plasma, Germany is in the top third for all these products compared with other European countries. The manufacture of allogeneic stem cell products for haematopoietic reconstitution, obtained by apheresis, has continuously risen to 4, 700. A large portion of this (1, 810 transplants) could be exported while only a small number (179 preparations) had to be imported. The manufacture of autologous stem cell preparations from cord blood has risen drastically to more than 10, 000 in 2007.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundFibrin sealant is {{frequently}} used in knee surgery as an adjuvant method for reducing postoperative bleeding, however, {{there is no}} consensus regarding the efficacy of fibrin sealant. HypothesisFibrin sealant achieves better efficacy in terms of blood loss control, <b>transfusion</b> rate and <b>units</b> in knee surgery compared with controls. MethodsA search of the Cochrane Collaboration (2013 Issue 09), Embase (1974 – 2013. 09), PubMed (1966 – 2013. 09) and Chinese databases (up to 2013. 09) were conducted. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used to assess for bias and data were analyzed by RevMan 5. 29 software. ResultsThis study included nine RCTs and four prospective comparative trials with a total of 1299 patients. Compared to the control, fibrin sealant achieved a decrease in hemoglobin reduction [MD= 1. 14, 95 % CI (0. 61 – 1. 67) ], transfusion rate [OR= 0. 36, 95 % CI (0. 25 – 0. 51) ], <b>transfusion</b> <b>units</b> [MD= 0. 47, 95 % CI (0. 24 – 0. 71) ], hospital stay [MD= 2. 22, 95 % CI (0. 56 – 3. 88) ] and the incidence of complications [OR= 0. 56, 95 % CI (0. 38 – 0. 83) ]. And it also reduced total blood loss, while {{there was no significant difference}} [MD= 155. 83, 95 % CI (– 525. 02 – 213. 15) ].

Discussed are the pathophysiology, clinical presenta-tion, and anesthetic management of valvular, congenital, vas-cular, and ischemic heart disease, and cardiomyopathy in pregnancy. Heart disease occurs in 1. 6 % of all parturients. The most common, rheumatic heart disease, has a mortality rate that varies from less than 1 % to 17 %. 1 Congenital heart disease (see Table 1) {{is associated with a}} broad range of maternal and fetal mortality, depending on the specific disease and its severity. 2 - 4 During pregnancy, cardiac output increases by 40 % at 8 months.

The presence of viable, replicating bacteria in stored blood could explain poor outcomes in transfusion recipients and have major implications for transfusion medicine. Here, we investigated the possibility that these structures were bacteria. Flow cytometry, miRNA analysis, protein analysis, and additional electron microscopy studies strongly indicated that the pleomorphic structures in the supernatant of stored RBCs were RBC-derived microparticles (RMPs). Bacterial 16 S rDNA PCR amplified from these samples were sequenced and {{was found to be}} highly similar to species that are known to commonly contaminate laboratory reagents. These studies suggest that pleomorphic structures identified in human blood are RMPs and not bacteria, and they provide an example in which laboratory contaminants may can mislead investigators...|$|R
50|$|Malvina Cheek {{was born}} at Hampton on Thames, the younger of two daughters of Percy Ebsworth Cheek, a banker with Glynn Mills, later Coutts (d. 1954) and Jessie, née Cross. Her Christian name comes from her {{paternal}} family's long-standing connection with the Falkland Islands. After leaving St Philomena’s, a Catholic school near Carshalton, she studied at Wimbledon School of Art {{and then at the}} Royal College of Art. Like many students of her generation she was influenced by the draftsman and engraver Robert Sargent Austin. Cheek gained her RCA Diploma in 1938. She taught for two days a week at the Central School of Art and was evacuated with the school to Luton during the Second World War. In Luton she continued to teach and also worked for a Blood <b>Transfusion</b> <b>Unit</b> at the local hospital, later moving to St Albans, where the art school was rapidly establishing itself as a centre of excellence. She would return to London for the weekend, a hazardous journey since there had to be total darkness on the trains to comply with the Blackout restrictions.|$|R
50|$|George William Gregory Bird, {{born in the}} UK in 1916, {{graduated}} in medicine in 1941. After joining the medical corps of the British Army, {{he served in the}} Middle East and India in the British Base <b>Transfusion</b> <b>Units</b> and trained army doctors on trauma management. During his posting in India, he established the first blood bank in India in 1948, as the Head of the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the Armed Forces Medical College, Pune. He worked at AFMC till 1966 during which time his researches on Dolichos biflorus (Horse gram) revealed the agglutinating activity of human A1 red cells in its extracts. He continued his researches on seeds and was credited with the discovery of anti-T in Arachis hypogea (peanut). His prolific work in this area is reported to have earned him the moniker, The King of Lectins and Polyagglutination. In 1961, when Queen Elizabeth II visited India, Gregory Bird was in charge of medical arrangements for the dignitary and also attended to Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the first Indian president, on his terminal medical condition. During this period, he continued his studies and secured FRCPath from the Royal College of Pathologists and a doctoral degree from London.|$|R

40|$|In stable {{critically}} ill children, {{the adoption of}} a restrictive transfusion strategy based on a predefined hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/ dl significantly decreased transfusion requirements without affecting outcome. These results strengthen previous observations made in volume resuscitated adults when a similar blood transfusion strategy was used. It also indirectly corroborates studies reporting the beneficial effects of leukoreduction of red blood cell (RBC) <b>transfusion</b> <b>units</b> on patient outcome. This study indicated that the maintenance of a higher hemoglobin concentration with RBC transfusion in an attempt to increase tissue oxygen delivery is not associated with a clinical benefit. This {{may be related to the}} storage process, which could affect the ability of RBCs to transport and deliver oxygen to the tissues. This point, however, remains controversial. It should also be remembered that increasing hemoglobin concentration will not always result in a greater oxygen delivery, as transfusion related increased blood viscosity could be associated with a reduction in blood flow. Further research should compare a symptomatic transfusion strategy to a hemoglobin-based strategy on the outcome of high risk patients. © 2007 BioMed Central Ltd.
