50|$|Melamine foam is {{the active}} {{component}} {{of a number of}} <b>abrasive</b> <b>cleaner</b> sponges. It is also used as the main sound and thermal insulation material for bullet trains, due to its high sound absorption, excellent thermal insulation performance and light weight.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{underground}} tunnels beneath the town. These were originally constructed as mines which supplied sandstone {{which could be}} used for construction or as an <b>abrasive</b> <b>cleaner.</b> Mining came to an end in 1920 but a 7.5 mi tunnel network remained. The tunnels were used as an air raid shelter during World War II. A part of the network can be visited on a guided tour.|$|E
5000|$|Do not use any {{powdered}} or <b>abrasive</b> <b>cleaners,</b> {{including most}} regular toothpastes, {{they are too}} abrasive and produce scratches on the denture surface.|$|R
50|$|Metal {{pots and}} stoves are often scoured with <b>abrasive</b> <b>cleaners,</b> {{typically}} {{in the form}} of the aforementioned cream or paste or of steel wool and non woven scouring pads which holds fine grits abrasives.|$|R
50|$|Dimension stone {{requires}} some specialized methods for cleaning and maintenance. <b>Abrasive</b> <b>cleaners</b> {{should not be}} used on a polished stone finish because it will wear the polish off. Acidic cleaners can not be used on marble or limestone because it will remove (i.e. dissolve) the finish. Textured finishes (thermal, bush-hammered) can be treated with some mildly <b>abrasive</b> <b>cleaners</b> but not bleach or an acidic cleaner (if marble or limestone). Stains are another consideration; stains can be organic (food, grease, or oil) or metallic (iron, copper). Stains require some special removal techniques, such as the poultice method. A new method of cleaning stone on ancient buildings (medieval and renaissance) has been developed in Europe: sulfur-reducing bacteria are used on the black gypsum-containing crusts that form on such buildings to convert the sulfur to a gas that dissipates, thus destroying the crust while leaving the patina produced by aging on the underlying stone. This method is still in development and not yet commercially available.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 21st century it was {{discovered}} that melamine foam is an effective <b>abrasive</b> <b>cleaner.</b> The open-cell foam is microporous and its polymeric substance is very hard, so that when used for cleaning it works like extremely fine sandpaper, getting into tiny grooves and pits in the object being cleaned. On a larger scale the material feels soft. Because the reticulated foam bubbles interconnect, its structure is a 3D network of very hard strands, when compared to the array of separate bubbles in a material such as styrofoam.|$|E
5000|$|Alice Letherdale {{testified that}} Kemp {{had asked her}} for some {{scouring}} sand (an <b>abrasive</b> <b>cleaner)</b> {{and that she had}} refused her, knowing Kemp to be a [...] "naughty beast". Letherdale's daughter Elizabeth later saw Kemp, who [...] "murmured" [...] at her. When Elizabeth fell ill and died, Letherdale blamed Kemp for bewitching the girl to death. Kemp's eight-year-old son Thomas testified that his mother kept four spirits, or familiars. He described them as a grey cat called Tyffin, a white lamb called Tyttey, a black toad called Pygine and a black cat called Jacke. He said that he had seen his mother give her familiars beer and cake, and let them suck blood from her body. Thomas said that he had been present when Alice Newman had visited his mother. He said that his mother had given Newman an earthenware pot, which he believed to contain the familiars. Days later, he saw Newman return telling Kemp that she had sent spirits to kill a local man and his wife.|$|E

50|$|Toner can {{be washed}} off skin and {{garments}} with cold water. Hot or warm water softens the toner, {{causing it to}} bond in place. Toner fused to skin eventually wears off, or can be partially removed using an <b>abrasive</b> hand <b>cleaner.</b> Toner fused to clothing usually cannot be removed.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{no strong}} {{scientific}} {{data concerning the}} origins of pelagic plastics. In {{a study published in}} 2014, researchers sampled 1571 locations throughout the worlds oceans, and determined that discarded fishing gear such as buoys, lines, and nets accounted for more than 60% of the mass of plastic marine debris. According to a 2011 EPA report, [...] "The primary source of marine debris is the improper waste disposal or management of trash and manufacturing products, including plastics (e.g., littering, illegal dumping) ... Debris is generated on land at marinas, ports, rivers, harbors, docks, and storm drains. Debris is generated at sea from fishing vessels, stationary platforms and cargo ships." [...] Pollutants range in size from abandoned fishing nets to micro-pellets used in <b>abrasive</b> <b>cleaners.</b> Currents carry debris from the west coast of North America to the gyre in about six years, and debris from the east coast of Asia in a year or less.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} it was {{examined}} {{how people are}} exposed to compounds contained in hygienic cleaning products used in the kitchen. The products for which exposure was assessed are dishwashing liquids, hygienic cleaning napkins, spray cleaners and bleach containing products (<b>abrasive,</b> all purpose <b>cleaner</b> and bleach). For each product type, exposure was assessed for one sample compound while performing one or two cleaning tasks in the kitchen. The exposure assessments were performed using the computer application, CONSEXPO. The calculated exposures were compared to the toxicity of the assessed compounds {{in order to assess}} risk. Exposure to didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride is concluded to be a possible cause of slight dermal irritation when using a hygienically cleaning trigger spray. On the basis of a first toxicological screening, exposure to the assessed compounds when using the products for cleaning tasks in the kitchen is not expected to cause adverse health effects...|$|R
