5|$|Permanent body piercings are {{performed}} {{by creating an}} opening in the body using a sharp object through the <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pierced.

5|$|Bikini waxing is the {{epilation}} of {{pubic hair}} beyond the bikini line {{by use of}} waxing. The bikini line delineates {{the part of a}} woman's pubic <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> covered by the bottom part of a bikini, which means any pubic hair visible beyond the boundaries of a swimsuit. Visible pubic hair is widely culturally disapproved, considered to be embarrassing, and often removed.|$|E
5|$|Cane toads pose {{a serious}} threat to native species when {{introduced}} to a new ecosystem. Classified as an invasive species in over 20 countries, there are multiple reports of the cane toad moving into a new <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> followed by a decline in the biodiversity in that region. The most documented region of the cane toad's invasion and subsequent effect on native species is Australia, where multiple surveys and observations of the toad's conquest have been completed. The best way to illustrate this effect is through the plight of the northern quoll, as well as Mertens' water monitor, a large lizard native to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E

In February 2007, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Russia announced their joint commitment to a $1.5-billion project to help develop vaccines for developing nations, and called on other countries to join them. In August 2007, Canada's territorial claims in the Arctic were challenged after a Russian underwater expedition to the North Pole; Canada has considered that <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sovereign territory since 1925.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{invention}} of the electric telegraph in 1835 that the modern age of weather forecasting began. Before that, the fastest that distant weather reports could travel was around 100 miles per day (160km/d), but was more typically 40–75 miles per day (60–120km/day) (whether by land or by sea). By the late 1840s, the telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions from a wide <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> received almost instantaneously, allowing forecasts to be made from knowledge of weather conditions further upwind.|$|E
5|$|On 23 January 1967 {{when the}} formal new town {{designation}} order was made, the , <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> developed was largely farmland and undeveloped villages. Before construction began, every area {{was subject to}} detailed archaeological investigation: doing so has exposed a rich history of human settlement since Neolithic times and has provided a unique insight {{into the history of}} a large sample of the landscape of north Buckinghamshire.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{legacies}} of colonial rule in Kasai was the arbitrary redivision of the population into new ethnic groups. Despite the shared language (Tshiluba) {{and culture of the}} two groups, colonial administrators believed the inhabitants of the Lulua river <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ethnically different from the Baluba and dubbed them the Bena Lulua. The colonists believed the Baluba to be more intelligent, hardworking and open to new ideas than the Bena Lulua who were believed to be more reactionary and stupid. As a result, from the 1930s, the state began to treat the two groups differently and applied different policies to each and promoted the Baluba to positions above other ethnicities.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} {{ceremony}} in Washington, {{representatives of the}} United States and Panama signed a series of fourteen executive agreements associated with the treaties. These included two Agreements in Implementation of Articles III and IV of the Panama Canal Treaty that detailed provisions concerning operation, management, protection, and defense, outlined in the main treaty. Most importantly, these two agreements defined the <b>areas</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> held by the United States until 2000 to operate and defend the canal. These areas were distinguished from military <b>areas</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used jointly by the United States and Panama until that time, military <b>areas</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> held initially by the United States but turned over to Panama before 2000, and areas that <b>were</b> turned over <b>to</b> Panama on October 1, 1979.|$|R
50|$|Isolated populations (e.g.,those on remote atolls) {{have high}} {{conservation}} value where they harbor endemic species and/or unique assemblages. A location or population 20-30 km from its nearest neighbor generally qualifies as {{isolated in the}} absence of a persistent linking current. Their isolation (low connectivity) requires such <b>areas</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> largely self-replenishing. This leaves them less resilient to disturbance. Sustaining their marine species requires a higher fraction of living <b>areas</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> protected.|$|R

5|$|Over Ross's protests, {{the men of}} the Sixth Regiment {{elected him}} colonel in 1862. He did not want the {{responsibility}} of the position and had not wanted to embarrass a friend who wanted the job. Their brigade commander, General Charles W. Phifer, was often absent, leaving Ross in charge. Ross's actions impressed other officers, and several times during the summer of 1862, he was nominated for promotion to brigadier general. Although he was not promoted at that time, his unit {{was the only one of}} the 810 dismounted cavalry units in the <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> promised the return of their horses.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty {{accepted}} that Barracudas were {{too slow to}} be effective against the Kaafjord area following the failure of Operation Goodwood. As a result, the task of attacking the battleship was transferred to RAF Bomber Command. The first heavy bomber raid against Kaafjord (Operation Paravane) was conducted on 15 September 1944, with the bombers flying from staging bases in northern Russia. This attack inflicted irreparable damage on Tirpitz, and she was transferred south to the Tromsø <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used as an immobile coastal defence battery. The battleship was sunk there with heavy loss of life by another Bomber Command raid on 12 November.|$|E
5|$|The Rampart Dam's {{large size}} had a {{correspondingly}} large price tag. The Corps of Engineers anticipated spending $618.4million (1970 dollars) on {{construction of the}} physical dam alone, another $492million for power-generating equipment, and $1.39billion in total. That total included $15.59million for relocating Alaskans from the <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> flooded, $56million for fish and wildlife facilities to mitigate the anticipated losses, and $39.7million for roads and bridges to access the area. After completion of the dam, the Corps of Engineers estimated that operation and maintenance of the project would cost $6.5million annually, including $570,000 for replacement power equipment and $2million {{for the maintenance of}} fish and wildlife facilities.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{claim to}} the land {{was made by the}} Doeg. Later the Lee family of Virginia owned the land from 1725 to 1839. Richard Bland Lee did not build the main house until 1794. Following the purchase by William Swartwort in 1838, Sully was used as a home, a working farm, or both by a series of private owners. Then in 1958, Sully was acquired by the federal government {{as a part of the}} <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used for the construction of Dulles Airport.

5|$|The foyer of {{the tower}} was {{originally}} planned to be an open-air forecourt between {{the building and the}} remains of the Palace Hotel, however extensive aeroelastic wind testing of the structure by the Institute of Environmental Sciences at Murdoch University forced this <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> covered with a glass canopy. Mocks of the curtain walls {{to be used in the}} tower were also tested to 1.5 times the proof load to ensure they could withstand cyclone-force weather and seismic shocks. The building is clad with green-tinted double-pane glass on windows, with the service core and structure of the building covered with aluminium sheeting skin coated with a light grey fluoropolymer paint.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from an {{isometric}} perspective, and the screen, which {{does not need to}} remain centered on the protagonist, can be scrolled with the mouse or the keyboard. Areas are revealed as they are explored by the player's characters. A fog of war effect hides explored areas when the player's characters move away from them. The player can also change the formation in which the party moves. Clicking an area exit, such as a doorway or staircase, causes another <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loaded. Clicking on the edge of an outside area causes the party to travel there; the game then presents the player with the World Map, from which the player may select a destination.|$|E
