40|$|Cartelizing {{is today}} {{among the most}} hunted {{business}} conduct in the world. Competition authorities from the countries where these statutes were adopted embrace the wisdom that such <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> <b>competitors</b> are unquestionably anti-competitive.

A cartel is today qualified as per se illegal. No further proof is needed but the formal agreement and the shared intentions. They are, at least until now, the only business practice that has lead, in certain jurisdictions, to jail terms and criminal record for individuals who were engaged in their negotiation and implementation. However, cartels are business practices that do not fundamentally aggress against any property right. From a public policy perspective, the harsh attitude towards cartels is lacking a theoretical coherence.

40|$|Horizontal <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> <b>competitors</b> with t h e object/effect of {{reducing}} competition between them through market partitioning, bid rigging, production/distribution quantities limitation and price fixing {{are considered to}} be the infringements of competition law. Cartel is an agreement under which competitors agree not to compete with each other and presents the most serious form of anticompetitive behaviour. Such arrangements allow companies to exert market power they would not otherwise have by artificially restricting competition with deleterious effect on welfare. Competition authorities around the world continue to declare cartel detection and conviction in competition enforcement as their highest priority. Taking part in cartel can have severe consequences for managers as well for the undertaking. In some jurisdictions employees involved in the infringement of competition law are criminally prosecuted facing financial fines and possible imprisonment. The reason behind it is an acknowledgment by competition authorities that the mere threat of sanctions against managers and personal liability could be a more effective deterrent than the possibility of only undertaking-focused sanctions. The amount of fines imposed for antitrust infringements, and for hard core cartel violations in particular, has notably augmented over the last years. This paper will argue why managers are employed in harmful activities risking imposition of severe fines and adverse reputational impact for themselves and the owners of the undertakings they work for and what are the tools within undertaking that can reduce the risk of being involved in unlawful antitrust practices and minimize the negative impact if anticompetitive behaviour has occurred...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we analyze the {{competitive}} eects of cooperation <b>between</b> <b>competitors</b> {{in the form of}} subcontracting and the influence of informa-tion, production and capacity on market structure and competition. Three game-theoretic models are developed to evaluate rms’s strategies and the competitive eects of information sharing and production sharing.

The models an-alyze the eects of subcontracting and exchange agreements on information sharing, capacity decisions and production decisions. Welfare eects with and without subcontracting are then being compared.

40|$|A presente dissertação objetiva verificar a possibilidade de utilização dos cartéis de exportação tendo em vista o ordenamento jurídico brasileiro. Para tanto, um importante corte metodológico foi realizado: somente questões relativas ao direito constitucional e ao direito concorrencial foram analisadas, deixando-se de lado aquelas que nos são trazidas pelo direito internacional e pela ciência econômica. O trabalho pode ser dividido em três grandes partes. A primeira cuida de justificar a escolha do tema cartéis de exportação. Para tanto, nos valemos da idéia de que as exportações são importante instrumento do qual se valem os Estados para equilibrar a sua atividade econômica e fomentar/financiar o seu desenvolvimento. A segunda parte cuida dos acordos entre concorrentes. Nesse passo, realizamos um pequeno estudo sobre as principais Escolas ideológicas que pretendem interpretar o direito antitruste e apontar a forma correta para a sua aplicação. Em seguida, cuidamos dos cartéis clássicos (os {{hard core}} cartels) e tratamos de diferenciá-los dos demais acordos entre concorrentes. É hora então de cuidarmos especificamente dos cartéis de exportação. Traremos as suas principais características, classificações e os benefícios e malefícios que são apontados pela doutrina. Bem definidos esses instrumentos, adentramos em um terreno bastante inóspito, que é o da forma pela qual os cartéis de exportação são encarados pelos Estados e pelas associações internacionais. Observaremos que, a despeito de serem utilizados por países como os Estados Unidos, existe uma tendência de que sejam tratados como condutas anticompetitivas, a semelhança dos cartéis clássicos. Uma das possíveis justificativas para isso seria a adoção generalizada dos conceitos da Escola de Chicago e das teorias econômicas neoclássicas. A {{principal}} crítica realizada por esses doutrinadores é a de que os cartéis de exportação são formas indevidas de atuação do Estado na economia que alteram as condições naturais de concorrência no mercado internacional. A última parte dessa dissertação está voltada para a inserção de toda a discussão promovida na moldura que nos é trazida pela Constituição Federal de 1988 e pela lei Antitruste brasileira (Lei 8884 / 1994). Para o texto constitucional, nosso enfoque será principalmente o dos artigos 3 ° (objetivos fundamentais da República Federativa do Brasil) e 170 (princípios gerais da atividade econômica). Com relação à lei antitruste, a discussão será voltada para a forma pela qual os cartéis de exportação são disciplinados por nossa lei. The present essay aims {{to verify the}} possibility of using export cartels, considering the Brazilian Law system. For that, an important methodological cut has been done: only matters regarding constitutional law and anti-trust law have been analyzed, leaving apart those matters that are brought to us by the international law and economical science. It can be divided in three big parts. The first one handles the justification for the choice of the subject export cartels. For that, we make use of the idea that the exportations are an important instrument for the Countries to balance their economical activity and stimulate/finance their development. The second part deals with the <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> <b>competitors.</b> At this pace, we made a small study about the main ideological stream, that intend to understand the antitrust law and identify the correct form for its application. Following that, we mention the classical cartels (the hard core cartels) and differentiate them from the other <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> <b>competitors.</b> It is time then to handle the export cartels. We mention their main traits, classification, benefits and losses that are pointed by the doctrine. Being those instruments well defined, we enter and uninviting terrain, that is the way that the countries and International Associations face the export cartels. We observe that, despite being used by countries like United States, {{there is a tendency to}} treat it like uncompetitive behavior, resembling the classical cartels. One of the possible explanations for that would be the general adoption of the concepts brought by the Chicago stream and the neoclassical economical theories. The authors main critic is that the export cartels are inappropriate methods of Government intervention in the Economy that alters the natural conditions of the competition in the international market. The last part of such essay is dedicated to the insertion of all the discussion promoted in the patters that are brought to us by the Federal Constitution of 1988 and the Anti-trust Brazilian Law (Law 8884 / 1994). Regarding the constitutional text, our focus in mainly on the 3 rd article (fundamental goals of the Brazilian Federal Republic), and the article 170 (general principles of the economical activity). Regarding the Anti-trust law, the discussion is facing the way that the export cartels are ruled by such area of our legal system...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the various {{activities}} of competition authorities, such as the United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trading or the US Federal Trade Commission, and shows examples of how a tough, competition-promoting stance can boost innovation. Each chapter considers {{one of the three}} main branches of competition policy: mergers, <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> <b>competitors</b> and the conduct of dominant firms. Chapter 2 shows how a government can foster innovation by tightening merger restrictions. A detailed model of innovation is used to show how merger policy affects market structure over the life-cycle of an industry. We show that mergers are only possible in later periods, once incumbent firms have established a technological lead over potential entrants. This means that the expectation of future rents from a relaxed merger policy encourages entry in the early stages. This can reduce R&D in the early stages and, as latter R&D builds on initial discoveries, limit innovation {{at the end of the}} life-cycle. We show that, in large markets, a government that aims to promote innovation should ban mergers when early innovation is sufficiently important for later research. A ban is also the optimal policy when a government aims to maximize welfare. In Chapter 3 we look at the effects of R&D cooperation among competing firms on technology choice. We demonstrate how firms in a duopoly can ensure that each adopts different technologies by agreeing, prior to conducting R&D, to share the results of their research. This has the effects of reducing product substitutability and thereby softening competition and increasing profits. We show that this can reduce innovation, consumer welfare and total welfare. The mo~~l also demonstrates how, once technology choice is taken into account, spillovers can be harmful even when R&D and output decisions are made simultaneously. Thus, unlike the rest of the literature, this result does not depend on the existence of the strategic motive to (over-) invest. In Chapter 4, we look at a systems market and show how an incumbent monopoly supplier of a primary product can protect its position through the technological tying of complementary goods. The key feature is that the production of complementary goods allows rivals to build up an absorptive capacity and thus benefits from spillovers from the incumbent. This in tum helps them challenge the incumbent in an R&D race to produce a superior version of the primary product. Tying reduces the aggregate rate of innovation and a competition authority that seeks to promote innovation should therefore ban it. Unlike other models in the literature, we do not drop the Chicago-School assumption that the complementary market is perfectly competitive.

40|$|Cartels often {{act like}} single {{dominant}} firms. Because {{there are a}} number of difficulties in determining market effects of single dominant firms, this article proposes that enforcement policy recognize the connection between cartels and firms engaged in monopolization. The resulting insight would be useful to determine whether or not cartel conduct should be viewed with suspicion when engaged in or by a dominant firm in a similar industry. Many cartels do not focus solely on suppressing interfirm rivalry; rather, many operate as two-stage mechanisms: the first stage consists of reaching a consensus on a plan to restrict output and curb rivalry; the second stage consists of using exclusionary behavior often featured in monopolization cases to ensure the effectiveness of its efforts to restrict output. Accordingly, antitrust authorities should look beyond the suppression of interfirm rivalry and investigate monopolization conduct. The focus on cartel applications of monopolization behavior has advantages for empirical investigation that illuminate the competitive significance of conduct by which individual firms are claimed to have monopolized markets. Currently, enforcement agencies often treat anticompetitive behavior of cartels differently than dominant firms because of the tendency to categorize anticompetitive behavior as either a horizontal <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> <b>competitors</b> to suppress interfirm rivalry or monopolization by a single dominant firm. It may be appropriate to view some cartel behavior as a combination of the two because some cartels exhibit single dominant firm type behavior. This article extends Michael Porter’s “Five Forces” to obtain a structure for understanding both the suppression of interfirm rivalry and monopolization conduct by a cartel and to show that monopolization behaviors are common in practicing cartels. Recognizing the analytical and behavioral links between the historically separate areas of cartel and dominant-firm behavior suggests a number of future directions for public enforcement policy and research by competition authorities. This article posits a number of suggestions and open questions for competition agencies in order to help guide antitrust authorities as to where they should direct monopolization resources. It concludes that antitrust authorities should not segregate anticompetitive behaviors into the two categories and should aggressively investigate the presence or absence of monopolization in cartels in order to prosecute and deter anticompetitive behavior...|$|R

Yet, end users were also principal players in some of the main recent patent cases before the U. S. Supreme Court. In Bowman v.
