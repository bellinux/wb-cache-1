5|$|The first raid on Singapore {{took place}} on 5November 1944. XXBomber Command {{dispatched}} 76 B-29s from their bases around Kharagpur. Because of the extreme range to the target, the aircraft were each armed with only two 1,000pound bombs; pilots were also instructed to bomb from the lower-than-normal altitude of , <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> a loose formation. The raid's primary target was the King George VI Graving Dock, and the Pangkalanbrandan refinery in northern Sumatra was assigned as the secondary target.|$|E
5|$|Abir {{enjoyed a}} boom {{through the late}} 1890s, by selling a {{kilogram}} of rubber in Europe for up to 10 fr which had cost them just 1.35 fr. However, this came {{at a cost to}} the human rights of those who could not pay the tax with imprisonment, flogging and other corporal punishment recorded. Abir's failure to suppress destructive harvesting methods <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> rubber plantations meant that the vines became increasingly scarce and by 1904 profits began to fall. During the early 1900s famine and disease spread across the concession, a natural disaster judged by some to have been exacerbated by Abir's operations, further hindering rubber collection. The 1900s also saw widespread rebellions against Abir's rule in the concession and attempts at mass migration to the French Congo or southwards. These events typically resulted in Abir dispatching an armed force to restore order.|$|E

The letter reminded Serbia of its commitment to respect the Great Powers' decision regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> good neighborly relations with Austria-Hungary. The letter contained specific demands aimed at preventing the publication of propaganda advocating the violent destruction of Austria-Hungary, removing the people behind this propaganda from the Serbian Military, arresting the people on Serbian soil {{who were involved in the}} assassination plot and preventing the clandestine shipment of arms and explosives from Serbia to Austria-Hungary.|$|E

Around that time, he and Czartoryski authored a plan for a European federal organization of states intended to prevent armed conflicts <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> perpetual peace. Piattoli, through Czartoryski, briefly worked in the diplomatic service and administration of the Russians, too. Like Czartoryski, Piattoli tried to push for a more lenient and friendly attitude towards Poland at the Russian court, but with little success.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, {{both parties}} made similar {{proposals}} to reduce authoritarianism {{and the political}} influence of the military, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> the Argentine claim in the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute. Alfonsín denounced a pact {{between the military and}} the Peronist unions that sought an amnesty for the military. He maintained that the armed forced should be subject to the civilian government, and that unions should be regulated. He also proposed an investigation into the actions of the military during the Dirty War. He closed his campaign by reading the preamble of the constitution of Argentina. The last rally was at the Plaza de la República, and was attended by 400,000 people.|$|E

5|$|Late 13th-century {{politics}} in the Eastern Mediterranean were complex, {{with a number of}} powerful interested parties. Baibars had three key objectives: to prevent an alliance between the Latins and the Mongols, to cause dissension between the Mongols particularly between the Golden Horde and the Persian Ilkhanate, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> access to a supply of slave recruits from the Russian steppes. In this he developed diplomatic ties with Manfred, King of Sicily, supporting him against the Papacy and LouisIX's brother Charles of Anjou. The Crusader states were fragmented, and various powers were competing for influence. In the War of Saint Sabas, Venice drove the Genoese from Acre to Tyre where they continued to trade happily with Baibars' Egypt. Indeed, Baibars negotiated free passage for the Genoese with Michael VIII Palaiologos, Emperor of Nicaea, the newly restored ruler of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Most {{classical}} theories, including Fisher's, {{held that}} velocity was stable and independent of economic activity. Cambridge economists, such as John Maynard Keynes, began to challenge this assumption. They developed the Cambridge cash-balance theory, which looked at money demand {{and how it}} impacted the economy. The Cambridge theory did not assume that money demand and supply were always at equilibrium, and it accounted for people holding more cash when the economy sagged. By factoring {{in the value of}} holding cash, the Cambridge economists took significant steps toward the concept of liquidity preference that Keynes would later develop. Cambridge theory argued that people hold money for two reasons: to facilitate transactions <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> liquidity. In later work, Keynes added a third motive, speculation, to his liquidity preference theory and built on it to create his general theory.|$|E

5|$|Since Ramanujan's {{father was}} at work most of the day, his mother {{took care of the}} boy as a child. He had a close {{relationship}} with her.

At the Kangayan Primary School, Ramanujan performed well. Just before turning 10, in November 1897, he passed his primary examinations in English, Tamil, geography and arithmetic with the best scores in the district. That year, Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Some sources {{state that}} William the Lion had a royal castle at Urquhart in the 12th century, though Professor Alcock finds no {{evidence}} for this. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Meic Uilleim (MacWilliams), descendents of Malcolm III, staged a series of rebellions against David I and his successors. The last of these rebellions was put down in 1229, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> order Alexander II granted Urquhart to his Hostarius (usher or door-ward), Thomas de Lundin. On de Lundin's death {{a few years later}} it passed to his son Alan Durward. It is considered likely that the original castle was built soon after this time, centred on the motte at the south-west of the site. In 1275, after Alan's death, the king granted Urquhart to John II Comyn, Lord of Badenoch.|$|E
