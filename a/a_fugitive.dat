5|$|Stirred {{into action}} by the 1930 Ohio penitentiary fire, which {{resulted}} in 300 deaths when guards refused to let inmates out of their cells, Hollywood produced movies which depicted the harsh conditions in prisons at the time. The prototype of the prison genre was 1930's The Big House. The picture features future genre staples such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, an escape, and the codes of prison life. Never box office hits, prison pictures failed to attract the female audiences they needed to achieve financial success. The chain gang films were produced in a similar response to the callous inhumanity of the chain gang system which was prevalent among states in the southern US. The 1932 film I Am <b>a</b> <b>Fugitive</b> from a Chain Gang is considered the seminal movie of the genre, and {{was based on the}} autobiography of Robert E. Burns who was himself <b>a</b> <b>fugitive</b> {{at the time of the}} picture's release.|$|E
