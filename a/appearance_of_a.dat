5|$|A diamond {{simulant}} is a non-diamond {{material that}} is used to simulate the <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diamond, and may be referred to as diamante.

5|$|Freshly {{prepared}} samarium has {{a silvery}} luster. In air, it slowly oxidizes {{at room temperature}} and spontaneously ignites at 150°C.

The metallic <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sample can be preserved by sealing it under an inert gas such as argon.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than do main sequence stars, while the opposite {{is the case for}} degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> star's spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption lines.|$|E
40|$|The <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object greatly changes under {{different}} lighting conditions. Even so, {{previous studies have}} demonstrated that the <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object under varying illumination conditions can be represented by a linear subspace. <b>A</b> set <b>of</b> basis images spanning such a linear subspace can be obtained by applying the principal component analysis (PCA) for <b>a</b> large number <b>of</b> images taken {{under different}} lighting conditions. Since little is known about how to sample the <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object in order to correctly obtain its basis images, it was a common practice to use as many input images as possible. In this study, we present a novel method for analytically obtaining <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> basis images <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object for varying illumination from input images of the object taken properly under <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> light sources, such as point light sources or extended light sources. Our proposed method incorporates the sampling theorem of spherical harmonics for determining <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> lighting directions to efficiently sample the <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object. We further consider the issue of aliasing caused by insufficient sampling <b>of</b> the object’s <b>appearance.</b> In particular, we investigate the effectiveness of using extended light sources for modeling the <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object under varying illumination without suffering the aliasing caused by insufficient sampling <b>of</b> its <b>appearance...</b>|$|R
