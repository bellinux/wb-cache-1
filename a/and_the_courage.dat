25|$|In addition, {{the ideal}} city {{is used as}} an image to {{illuminate}} the state of one's soul, or the will, reason, and desires combined in the human body. Socrates is attempting to make {{an image of a}} rightly ordered human, and then later goes on to describe the different kinds of humans that can be observed, from tyrants to lovers of money in various kinds of cities. The ideal city is not promoted, but only used to magnify the different kinds of individual humans and the state of their soul. However, the philosopher king image was used by many after Plato to justify their personal political beliefs. The philosophic soul according to Socrates has reason, will, and desires united in virtuous harmony. A philosopher has the moderate love for wisdom <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to act according to wisdom. Wisdom is knowledge about the Good or the right relations between all that exists.|$|E

500|$|From 1964 to 1965, Biko {{studied at}} St. Francis College, a Catholic {{boarding}} school in Mariannhill, Natal.

[...] Leigh's performance was tinged by paranoia and resulted in outbursts that marred her relationship with other actors, although both Simone Signoret and Lee Marvin were sympathetic and understanding. In one unusual instance during the attempted rape scene, Leigh became distraught and hit Marvin so hard with a spiked shoe, that it marked his face. Leigh won the L'Étoile de Cristal for her performance in a leading role in Ship of Fools.|$|E
