M47 can be seen with the naked eye under dark skies, and its brightest stars are 6th magnitude. Messier 93 (M93) is another open cluster somewhat to the south. NGC 2451 is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>bright</b> open cluster containing the star c Puppis and the near NGC 2477 is a good target for small telescopes.

25|$|Actually {{there is}} in fact much more that can be {{inferred}} from this citation. The citation explicitly refers to the year that this event happened, 670 of the Seleucid era, which corresponds to 358/9 CE. The Molad of Tishrei for that year 4119 would be Sat 23 hours and 233 parts. Under the Gregorian calendar this would be Sat, Sept 20, 0358 17:12. Rosh Hashanah would have begun Friday evening but not before, according to lunar science, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>bright</b> Old Moon will rise Friday morning at 4:11 AM, an hour and 34 minutes before sunrise. The significance {{of this can be}} found in the Talmud Rosh Hashanah 25a.|$|E
25|$|The {{color of}} {{red blood cells}} {{is due to the}} heme group of hemoglobin. The blood plasma alone is straw-colored, but the red blood cells change color {{depending}} {{on the state of the}} hemoglobin: when combined with oxygen the resulting oxyhemoglobin is scarlet, and when oxygen has been released the resulting deoxyhemoglobin is of a dark red burgundy color. However, blood can appear bluish when seen through the vessel wall and skin. Pulse oximetry takes advantage of the hemoglobin color change to directly measure the arterial blood oxygen saturation using colorimetric techniques. Hemoglobin also has a very high affinity for carbon monoxide, forming carboxyhemoglobin which is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>bright</b> red in color. Flushed, confused patients with a saturation reading of 100% on pulse oximetry are sometimes found to be suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|E

25|$|The binding {{of oxygen}} is {{affected}} by molecules such as carbon monoxide (for example, from tobacco smoking, exhaust gas, and incomplete combustion in furnaces). CO competes with oxygen at the heme binding site. Hemoglobin's binding affinity for CO is 250 times greater than its affinity for oxygen, meaning that small amounts of CO dramatically reduce hemoglobin's ability to transport oxygen. Since carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless and tasteless gas, and poses a potentially fatal threat, carbon monoxide detectors have become commercially available to warn of dangerous levels in residences. When hemoglobin combines with CO, it forms <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>bright</b> red compound called carboxyhemoglobin, which may cause the skin of CO poisoning victims to appear pink in death, instead of white or blue. When inspired air contains CO levels as low as 0.02%, headache and nausea occur; if the CO concentration is increased to 0.1%, unconsciousness will follow. In heavy smokers, up to 20% of the oxygen-active sites can be blocked by CO.|$|E
25|$|Most {{theatrical}} lamps are tungsten-halogen (or quartz-halogen), {{an improvement}} {{on the original}} incandescent design that used halogen gas instead of an inert gas. Fluorescent lights are rarely used other than as work lights (see below). Although they are far more efficient, they cannot be dimmed (run at less than full power) without using specialized dimmers, cannot dim to very low levels, do not produce light from a single point or easily concentrated area, and have a warm-up period during which they emit no light or do so intermittently. High-intensity discharge lamps (or HID lamps) are now common where <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>bright</b> light output is required, for example in large follow spots, HMI (hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide) floods, and modern automated fixtures. Because these types of lamps cannot be electrically dimmed, dimming is done by mechanical dousers or shutters that physically block portions of the lamp to decrease output. Some specially-designed fittings now use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as a light source. LEDs are ideal where an intense but unfocused light source is required, such as for lighting a cyclorama.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Blackpool Transport, having {{completed}} its OMO rebuild programme, was still {{left with a}} significant surplus of cash. Using a redundant Balloon (725), BTS set to work on creating an experimental double-deck OMO car. It was completed in 1979; unlike the OMOs {{it did not have}} centre doors and had a much more bus-like appearance. It was thought a success, so a second was created using another redundant Balloon (714), which unlike the first, retained its centre doors. They were numbered 761 and 762 respectively. Although a success and a big crowd-mover, no more were built. The pair carried on in service until the modernisation of the tramway in 2011–2012. Both cars are preserved; 761 by the Blackpool Heritage Trust and 762 by the National Tramway Museum in Derbyshire. After a long period of refurbishment, 762 carried out test runs at the museum and re-entered service in September 2014. 761, meanwhile, was preserved by the Fleetwood Heritage Leisure Trust and was in outside storage until December 2013 when it was moved back in to Blackpool Transport's Rigby Road Depot. In May 2017, 761 was transferred from the Fleetwood Heritage Leisure Trust to Blackpool Heritage Trust. Both cars carried many colourful advertising liveries throughout their lives and both still carry one in preservation; 762 in particular wears <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>bright</b> scheme advertising an attraction at Blackpool's Pleasure Beach theme park.|$|E

25|$|Staccato {{lightning}} is a cloud-to-ground lightning (CG) strike {{which is}} a short-duration stroke that (often but not always) appears as <b>a</b> single <b>very</b> <b>bright</b> flash and often has considerable branching.

It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>bright,</b> very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E
