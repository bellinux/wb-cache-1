5|$|A Sudoku with 24 clues, {{dihedral}} symmetry (symmetry on both orthogonal axis, 90° rotational symmetry, 180° rotational symmetry, and diagonal symmetry) {{is known}} to exist, and is also automorphic. <b>Again</b> <b>here,</b> {{it is not known}} if this number of clues is minimal for this class of Sudoku. The fewest clues in a Sudoku with two-way diagonal symmetry is believed to be 18, and in at least one case such a Sudoku also exhibits automorphism.|$|E
5|$|When Galveston's {{second major}} {{hurricane}} hit the Texas coastline in mid-August 1915, {{most of the}} Army units had scattered to safe locations away from the storm's path, with a few units remaining in the secure buildings of Fort Crockett or in downtown Galveston. The Middletons chose to ride out the storm at the Hagemann house. Following the storm cleanup, in October 1915, the 7th Regiment was ordered to Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas as events in Mexico flared up <b>again.</b> <b>Here</b> they were put {{under the command of}} Brigadier General John Pershing, a highly capable officer who had skipped three ranks by being promoted from captain to brigadier general for his exceptional service during the Philippine-American War.|$|E

He was subsequently set free by the British consulate, but his ship set him ashore in Dover {{for fear of being}} captured <b>again.</b> <b>Here,</b> his story was recorded. Shabeeni gave an indication {{of the size of the}} city in the second half of the 18th century. In an earlier passage, he described an environment that was characterized by forest, as opposed to nowadays' arid surroundings.|$|E

Here, Route71 continues northwestward on Monmouth Road through large commercial complexes {{and the local}} country club. The highway continues northward into Eatontown, where it enters a local residential area and intersects with County Route 547 (Eatontown Boulevard), which become concurrent. Routes 71 and 547 enter downtown Eatontown as Broad Street, heading westward with County Route 547 splitting at Wyckoff Road. The two highways continue into the commercial district of Eatontown, where they intersect with New Jersey Route 35 once <b>again.</b> <b>Here,</b> Route71 terminates at the intersection in downtown Eatontown.|$|E
25|$|In 1893–1894 Merezhkovsky {{published}} numerous books (the play The Storm is Over and {{the translation}} of Sophocles' Oedipus the King among them), but the money all this hard work brought were scant. Now writing his second novel, he had to accept whatever work was offered to him. In the late 1893 Merezhkovskys settled in Saint Petersburg <b>again.</b> <b>Here</b> they frequented the Shakespearean Circle, the Polonsky's Fridays and the Literary Fund gatherings. Then the pair started their own home salon with Filosofov and Akim Volynsky becoming habitués. All of a sudden Merezhkovsky found that his debut novel was {{to be published in}} Severny Vestnik after all. What he didn't realise was that this came {{as a result of a}} Gippius' tumultuous secret love affair with Akim Volynsky, one of this magazine's chiefs.|$|E
25|$|In reality, {{the most}} {{significant}} hazard is driving, which is made more dangerous by the severe weather. Adding still more to this hazard are the multiple distractions which can compete for a chaser's attention, such as driving, communicating with chase partners and others with a phone and/or radio, navigating, watching the sky, checking weather data, and shooting photos or video. <b>Again</b> <b>here,</b> prudence is key to minimizing the risk. Chasers ideally work to prevent the driver from multitasking either by chase partners covering the other aspects or by the driver pulling over to do these other things {{if he or she}} is chasing alone. Falling asleep while driving is a chase hazard, especially on long trips back. This also is exacerbated by nocturnal darkness and by the defatigating demands of driving through precipitation and on slick roads.|$|E

25|$|In the {{southern}} half of Elmira, the parkway winds {{its way through}} residential and commercial areas before crossing over the Chemung River to reach the city's downtown district. Here, NY14 intersects with both directions of NY352, routed along Water Street eastbound and Church Street westbound. The route continues on, traversing commercial and industrial neighborhoods {{on the fringe of}} downtown on its way to a junction with Thurston Street. At this point, NY14 leaves the parkway to follow Thurston Street and Woodlawn Avenue—collectively one two-lane street—west for three blocks to College Avenue. The route turns <b>again</b> <b>here,</b> following College Avenue north past Eldridge Park to the adjacent village of Elmira Heights. While in the village, NY14 passes through gradually more residential areas as it heads north. Outside of Elmira Heights, the highway becomes Corning Road and proceeds toward the nearby village of Horseheads.|$|E
25|$|In 1978 Boyns {{had plenty}} of first-team {{opportunities}} from late May to early July, {{but on the whole}} did not make the most of them. His highest score during this period was 41*, and though he claimed a List A career-best of 4–34 in the John Player League against Leicestershire he was soon back in the seconds yet <b>again.</b> <b>Here,</b> as they had on several previous occasions, the runs flowed, with scores of 105*, 87 and 78* leading to his recall. He made 71 against the New Zealanders {{in the second half of}} August, but little else was worthy of note. By 1979 Boyns' days as a Worcestershire cricketer were numbered, and indeed he made only one first-class appearance that summer, against the Sri Lankans in mid-July, although he did play six times in one-day matches. His last first-class wicket was that of Sri Lankan Roy Dias, while his last List A scalp was Sussex's Tony Pigott just a few days later.|$|E

After crossing {{under the}} Thruway and I-87 <b>again,</b> <b>here</b> concurrent with I-287, and then intersecting with the four-lane NY119, where 119 splits {{off to the}} east, Broadway becomes the busy main street of Tarrytown. Christ Episcopal Church, where Irving worshiped, is along the street. Many high quality restaurants and shops are along this main road. This downtown ends at the eastern terminus of NY448, where Broadway slopes off to the left, downhill, and four signs indicate that Broadway turns left, passing the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow, another NHL. The road then enters Sleepy Hollow (formerly North Tarrytown), passing the visitors' center for Kykuit, the National Historic Landmark that was (and partially still is) the Rockefeller family's estate. Broadway then passes the historic Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, which includes the resting place of Washington Irving and the setting for The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.|$|E

Based on the Peel performance, Rough Trade label head Geoff Travis suggested that the band release the song as a single instead of the slated release [...] "Reel Around the Fountain", which had gathered notoriety in the press due to what were seen as lyrical references to pedophilia. The Smiths entered Matrix Studios in London on September 1983 to record a second studio version of the song for release as a single. However, the result—known as the 'London version'—was unsatisfactory and soon after, the band travelled to Strawberry Studios in Stockport to try <b>again.</b> <b>Here,</b> they recorded the more widely heard A-side.|$|E
500|$|However, the Princess {{decides to}} take matters {{in her own}} hands and travel to the Tomb of Raithwall to obtain the {{treasure}} of the Dynast-King. Vossler catches up, after being left behind, at the Ogir-Yensa Sandsea, while {{on their way to}} the Tomb. He offers to protect Princess Ashe once again, despite objecting to Balthier and Fran's invading the royal tomb. However, once the party gets the treasure, the Dawn Shard, from the tomb, they are taken aboard the Leviathan once <b>again.</b> <b>Here,</b> Vossler reveals that he, embittered by their [...] "profitless battle", has made a deal with the Archadian Empire so that Dalmasca's sovereignty could be restored. After he was defeated he tells Basch that it's up to him to protect the Princess now. As Ashe and the others escape in an airship, the nethicite explosion from the Leviathan annihilates the fleet, Vossler is presumably alive because the Shiva was seen able to escape the explosion, albeit badly damaged. Vossler was voiced by Nolan North in English and by Masaki Terasoma in Japanese.|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} the White Walkers' origin, David Benioff stated [...] "No one's {{innocent}} really in this world, {{and there was just}} something really beautifully right about the idea that the great nemesis of mankind were created to protect the Children of the Forest from mankind." [...] D. B. Weiss noted, [...] "The Night King, who's sort of the embodiment of absolute evil, what you're watching is the creation of that absolute evil, so the absolute evil isn't absolute after all." [...] Benioff also alluded to the many references and foreshadowing throughout the series that preceded the reveal of the Children creating the White Walkers, saying, [...] "There are certain symbols and patterns that recur throughout the show. The first time we saw {{that was one of the}} very first scenes in the pilot, when Will the ranger sees the Wildling body parts in an odd pattern displayed by the White Walkers. We see it again north of the Wall with the dead horses displayed in a spiral pattern, and then you see it <b>again</b> <b>here</b> and see where these patterns come from, that they're ancient symbols of the Children of the Forest used in their rituals, and the Children of the Forest created the White Walkers." ...|$|E
