Marketers have long been aware of the influence of peers on attitudes and this is a particularly important concept for subcultures which are socially oriented and experienced based. Participants communicate via many means and move between geographic locations. An example of a subculture is straight edge and their consumption is therefore affected by the socially constructed attitudes of the subgroup.|$|E

She noted that Cole's various outfits appear to distract people from the lyrics of the song which [...] "seem to be, a thinly veiled reflection on her own marriage compounded by the sad mooning face she keeps pulling.

'I want happiness and I want pure and real love, but the side effects of what other relationships have put me through cause me to be kind of on the defensive <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> And if somebody isn’t mature or caring and loving and open-hearted enough to understand that, then it’s tough, but this is a song for people who need that.'

[...] Felicity Montagu, who plays Partridge's assistant Lynn, felt he was a good person [...] "deep down" [...] and actually [...] "vulnerable and lovable". Iannucci said that Partridge stays optimistic because he never sees himself as others see him, and that despite his failings was [...] "the perfect broadcaster for these times, when there are 24 hours to fill and dead time is a crime – he has a unique capacity to fill any vacuum with his own verbal vacuum." [...] Rob and Neil Gibbons felt that by the time of Mid Morning Matters, when Partridge is working for an even smaller radio station, he was more at peace with himself and that his lack of self-awareness saved him from misery.|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} Mummy, Berton used a {{combination}} of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, [...] "When you see his film image, that's him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing {{and you can see}} right through on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's why it was so hard to do." [...] Vosloo described the filming as a [...] "whole new thing" [...] for him; [...] "They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree." [...] Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.|$|E

[...] The Daily Mirrors Jim Shelley didn't find the storyline [...] "interesting or convincing", finding Lyndhurst's {{performance}} as Freddie [...] "laughable" [...] and saying it was [...] "bizarre" [...] that the storyline [...] "virtually abandoned its main character (the young Del Boy) and its best actor (the engaging James Buckley from The Inbetweeners) who played him".

[...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from your peers and really coming into your own." [...] McKinnon said What Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, {{and that it was}} [...] "a natural progression of what we were doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, because of me coming in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E
500|$|Milian's third studio album, So Amazin', was {{released}} on May 16, 2006. The album's lead single, [...] "Say I", featured rapper Young Jeezy. The single saw peak positions of number four in the UK, and number twenty-one in the US. So Amazin debuted and peaked at number eleven on the Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 54,000 copies in its first week and 163,000 copies in total. Internationally, the album peaked at number 55 on the Swiss Albums Chart, 67 on the UK Albums Chart, and 139 on the France Albums Chart. Reviews of So Amazin were mixed; critics felt that while Milian claimed that she was displaying the various sides of her personality, the album could [...] "only [...] the surface of who she really is." [...] "Say I" [...] was praised by several critics, and was described as [...] "instantly rousing" [...] and [...] "intoxicating". In June 2006, Milian's representative confirmed {{that she had been}} dropped by Island Def Jam. In an interview with Rap-Up, Milian revealed she was dropped a week after her album {{was released}}. The singer believed it was a [...] "budget cut", and that Island Def Jam Music Group wanted to spend more money on label mate Rihanna. She said, [...] "it was embarrassing. It was a week after my album got put out. I would be in my room <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> crying by myself."

500|$|The album's {{recording}} sessions {{took place}} from July 1993 to September 1993 at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle, Washington, as according to Cornell [...] "there {{was never a}} decent studio in Seattle and now there's one with a Neve console, so it seemed obvious to use it". Bad Animals' resident engineer Adam Kasper, {{who went on to}} produce Soundgarden's following albums, assisted Beinhorn on the recording process. Soundgarden took the approach of recording one song at a time. The drum and bass parts were recorded first for each song, and then Cornell and Thayil would lay down their parts over top. Cornell said that getting to know Beinhorn contributed to the length of time Soundgarden spent working on the album. The band spent time experimenting with different drum and guitar sounds, as well as utilizing techniques such as layering, resulting in an expansive production sound. Cornell said, [...] "Michael Beinhorn was so into sounds. He was so, almost, anal about it, that it took the piss out of us <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time...</b> By the time you get the sounds that you want to record the song, you're sick and tired of playing it." [...] Beinhorn tried to add many of his preferred musicians to mold the band's sound, in what Billboard described as [...] "weaning the band from brute force, giving it the impetus to invest in a more subtle power". For instance, prior to recording the vocals of [...] "Black Hole Sun", Beinhorn made Cornell listen to Frank Sinatra.|$|E

The topcoat {{consists}} of long, straight, water-repellent hair, which provides protection from cold and the elements. The undercoat is short, furry, and very dense and helps to keep the dog warm. Mats can be commonly found behind the ears, under the elbow on each front leg, and in the fluffy fur on the hind legs (the [...] "skirts"), as well as around the collar (if worn). The coat is usually shed twice a year, often at spring and autumn. Females will also shed right before or right after giving birth. Male shelties technically shed less than females but [...] fur still comes off constantly. Shaving these dogs is very bad for their skin and some do not regrow any significant amount of hair after being shaved, a condition known as alopecia. [...] Spaying or neutering can alter coat texture, making it softer, more prone to matting and even more profuse. It {{should be noted that}} Shelties shed in clumps which can be pulled or brushed out of the main coat, rather than individual hair. This makes them much easier to groom and clean-up after than many smooth-haired dogs, which leave loose fur in their space.|$|E
