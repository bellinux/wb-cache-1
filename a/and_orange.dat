5|$|Derrickson {{was fascinated}} by color schemes. He chose blue-green <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> as the primary colors for The Day the Earth Stood Still. The missile silo {{converted}} by the military for experimenting on Gort emphasized gray <b>and</b> <b>orange,</b> which was inspired by an image of lava flowing through a gray field. Derrickson opted to shoot on traditional film, and rendered the colors in post-production {{to make them more}} subtle, for realism.|$|E

5|$|Making {{landfall}} {{near the}} border between Mexico and British Honduras, the latter colony's Corozal <b>and</b> <b>Orange</b> Walk districts, containing a population of 15,500at the time, experienced severe devastation from Janet. Strong hurricane winds knocked down and damaged numerous trees across British Honduras, particularly in the Freshwater Creek Forest Preserve. There, an estimated 30%of all trees had been damaged, especially mahogany and sapodilla trees. Hurricane Janet also caused extensive damage to crops, with an estimated $2.631million in damages. Fruit trees, maize, and sugar cane crops suffered the most damage. Sugar cane was {{expected to have a}} 20%decrease in yield due to the damage sustained after the storm. Pineapple crops and livestock experienced less significant losses. To a lesser extent, the hurricane also affected the Belize District and several of British Honduras' offshore cayes. Similar to Corozal <b>and</b> <b>Orange</b> Walk Districts, corn, trees, and coconut experienced the most severe damage of any crop.|$|E
5000|$|While {{references}} to comparing apples <b>and</b> <b>oranges</b> {{is often a}} rhetorical device, {{references to}} adding apples <b>and</b> <b>oranges</b> {{are made in the}} case of teaching students the proper uses of units. Here, the admonition not to [...] "add apples and oranges" [...] refers to the requirement that two quantities with different units may not be combined by addition, although they may always be combined in ratio form by multiplication, so that multiplying ratios of apples <b>and</b> <b>oranges</b> is allowed. Similarly, the concept of this distinction is often used metaphorically in elementary algebra.|$|R

50|$|In the {{philosophy}} of science, underdetermination refers to situations where the evidence available is insufficient to identify which belief one should hold about that evidence. For example, if all that was known was that exactly $10 was spent on apples <b>and</b> <b>oranges,</b> <b>and</b> that apples cost $1 <b>and</b> <b>oranges</b> $2, then one would know enough to eliminate some possibilities (e.g., 6 oranges {{could not have been}} purchased), but one would not have enough evidence to know which specific combination of apples <b>and</b> <b>oranges</b> was purchased. In this example, one would say that belief in what combination was purchased is underdetermined by the available evidence.|$|R
