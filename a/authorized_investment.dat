30|$|In 1997, the CPC’s Fifteenth National Congress {{put forward}} the SOE reform idea of “focusing on the {{restructuring}} of major enterprises while leaving minor ones to fend for themselves.” This required the government to change its function and further establish systems of clear rights and responsibilities for managing, supervising, and running state assets to guarantee their maintenance and appreciation. In 1999, the former State Economic and Trade Commission introduced policies relevant to the above change, clearly stating that state-owned corporations, after being restructured and listed as stock corporations, must usually adopt the three-tier authorization management model. The first tier is the government division that supervises and manages state assets; the second tier is the “authorized investment institutions” that run state assets but are administered by the state supervision division of state assets; the third is the shareholding corporations whose shares are dominated by the <b>authorized</b> <b>investment</b> institutions.|$|E

40|$|The new Regulation {{regarding}} {{the reception of}} construction works and corresponding installations, approved by Government's Decision no. 347 / 2017 (“Regulation 2017 ”) has general applicability for all construction works {{for which there is}} an obligation to obtain a building permit. Regulation 2017 brings significant changes and clarifications expected by the real estate sector regarding: (i) the composition of the commissions involved in the reception procedure, (ii) the role of the site supervisor who thus gains significant participation in the reception procedure, and (iii) the participation of the public authorities' representatives at the reception, having the veto right on the decision of the reception commission upon the completion of the construction works. Another element of novelty brought by Regulation 2017 is the possibility to do the reception upon the completion of the construction works, respectively the final reception for parts / objectives / sectors of or from the building, if they are distinct/ independent from a physical and functional point of view. Thus, the new regulation facilitates the procedure of <b>authorizing</b> <b>investment</b> objectives and the costs of the process.

25|$|Anxious to {{pay homage}} to Stalin, Albania's rulers {{implemented}} elements of the Stalinist economic system. In 1949 Albania adopted the basic elements of the Soviet fiscal system, under which state enterprises paid direct contributions to the treasury from their profits and kept only a share <b>authorized</b> for self-financed <b>investments</b> and other purposes. In 1951 the Albanian government launched its first five-year plan, which emphasized exploiting the country's oil, chromite, copper, nickel, asphalt, and coal resources; expanding electricity production and the power grid; increasing agricultural output; and improving transportation. The government began a program of rapid industrialization after the APL's Second Party Congress and a campaign of forced collectivization of farmland in 1955. At the time, private farms still produced about 87% of Albania's agricultural output, but by 1960 the same percentage came from collective or state farms.|$|R

We examined bicycle- and pedestrianrelated <b>investments</b> <b>authorized</b> by federal transportation legislation in 3, 140 {{counties in the}} United States by region, population size and urbanization, social and economic characteristics, and indicators of travel-related walking and bicycling.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the changes of Taiwan stock market volatility {{and attempts to}} understand the relation between some variables and stock volatility. We find {{that the stock market}} volatility is the largest in the period between 1986 and 1990 and the standard error of Taiwan stock volatility after 1986 is higher than the standard error of Taiwan stock volatility before 1986 regardless of daily or month data. In the whole period, We find that Taiwan stock market exits volatility asymmetry. Because {{we want to know what}} moves the stock market volatility, we sort those variables by three aspects, such as macroeconomic, system and transaction. The empirical results show that <b>authorizing</b> the <b>investment</b> trust to establish and options trading, bring two parties together by computers, the changes of limits and the volume of stock market have effects upon the stock volatility. In the part of macroeconomic, we find the discount rate has the negative effect upon the stock volatility. 本文以EGARCH模型探討台灣股市波動性的變化以及影響的相關因素，研究期間為民國 61 年至 94 年。從台灣股市波動性基本統計量中，發現台灣股市在民國 75 年至民國 79 年這段期間波動性最大，並且不管在日資料或月資料可以看出在民國 75 年之後，台灣股市標準差明顯高於民國 75 年以前。在所研究的整體期間內，台灣股市波動顯著存在不對稱性。 在影響因素則分別由交易面、制度面與總體經濟面，探討影響股市波動性的相關因素。實證結果發現：在開放投信、電腦撮合制度的實施、漲跌幅限制調整、開放選擇權交易與股市成交量對股市波動性有顯著影響。在總體經濟部分，發現貼現率對股市波動性有顯著的負影響。目 錄 頁 次 第一章緒論 第一節 研究動機 [...] . 1 第二節 台灣股市歷史回顧 [...] . 1 第二章 文獻回顧 [...] . 4 第三章 研究設計 第一節 資料來源與處理 1. 時間趨勢圖 [...] . 9 2. 資料檢定 [...] . 9 第二節 模型測試、檢定與估計 1. 條件平均數模型配置 [...] . 11 2. 波動性估計與條件變異數方程式建立 [...] . 12 第三節 完整模型建立 [...] . 14 第四章 結論與建議 第一節 加權指數基本統計量特徵 [...] . 17 第二節 台灣股市波動性的變化 [...] . 17 第三節 各變數對股市波動性影響 [...] . 18 第四節 結論 [...] . 20 第五節 後續研究建議 [...] . 21 參考文獻 [...] 45 參考書目 [...] 50 表目錄 表一 : 台灣股市市值、成交值與流通在外股數 [...] . 22 表二：台灣股市基本統計量 [...] 24 表三：民國 60 年至 94 年月報酬率-最高與最低前 20 名 [...] . 25 表四：台灣股市與其他主要國家股市週轉率 [...] 26 表五：台灣股市交易人結構 [...] 26 表六：股票漲跌幅度調整 [...] 27 表七：台灣期貨指數與摩根台指期貨契約差異 [...] 29 表八 : 總體經濟變數基本統計量 [...] . 30 表九：變數單根檢定 [...] 30 表十：條件平均數選取 [...] 30 表十一：GARCH(1, 1) 與EGARCH(1, 1) 比較表 [...] . 31 表十二 :子期間EGARCH模型比較 [...] 32 表十三 :兩段期間EGARCH模型比較 [...] 33 表十四：制度面與交易面對股市波動影響 [...] 34 表十五：總體經濟變數對股市波動影響 [...] 35 表十六：未預期總體經濟變數對股市波動影響 [...] 36 表十七:總體經濟變數與未預期總體經濟變數對股市波動影響. 37 表十八：制度面、交易面與總體經濟變數對股市波動影響 [...] 38 表十九：兩段期間總體經濟變數對股市波動影響比較 [...] 39 圖目錄 圖一：台灣股市本益比 [...] 40 圖二：台灣股市月週轉率時間趨勢圖 [...] 40 圖三:台灣股價指數時間趨勢圖 [...] . 41 圖四:消費者物價指數趨勢圖 [...] . 41 圖五:工業生產指數時間趨勢圖 [...] . 42 圖六:貼現率時間趨勢圖 [...] . 42 圖七:M 1 B貨幣供給量時間趨勢圖 [...] 43 圖八:新台幣對美元匯價時間趨勢圖 [...] . 43 圖九:台灣股市月成交量時間趨勢圖 [...] . 4...|$|R
