5|$|Animal {{husbandry}} is {{the branch}} of agriculture concerned with <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> are raised for meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other products. It includes day-to-day care, selective breeding and the raising of livestock.|$|E
5|$|Carrion (nevelah): {{meat from}} a kosher animal {{that has not}} been {{slaughtered}} according to the laws of shechita. This prohibition includes <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> have been slaughtered by non-Jews.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{poisonous}} or distasteful <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> advertise {{their presence}} with warning coloration (aposematism) use patterns that emphasize rather than disrupt their outlines. For example, skunks, salamanders and monarch butterflies all have high-contrast patterns that display their outlines.|$|E
50|$|The {{proximate}} {{causes of}} stimulus filtering can be {{many things in}} and around an animal’s environment, but the ultimate cause of this response may be the evolutionary advantage offered by stimulus filtering. An <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> saves energy by not responding to unnecessary stimuli may have increased fitness, which means {{that it would be}} able to produce more offspring, whereas an <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> does not filter stimuli may have reduced fitness due to depleted energy stores. An <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> practices stimulus filtering may also be more likely to respond appropriately to serious threats than an <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> is distracted by unimportant stimuli.|$|R

60|$|The chief saw by the {{staggering}} of the <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> it was mortally wounded, {{and that there}} was no need to follow it up, as it could be easily tracked and found in daylight. He therefore turned to attack another <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> was close at hand.|$|R

5|$|The {{reverse of}} countershading, with the belly {{pigmented}} {{darker than the}} back, enhances contrast and so makes animals more conspicuous. It is found in <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> can defend themselves, such as skunks. The pattern is used both in startle or deimatic displays and as a signal to warn off experienced predators. However, <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> habitually live upside-down but lack strong defences, like the Nile catfish and the luna moth caterpillar, have upside-down countershading for camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The zoo {{provides}} sanctuary to many <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> need a {{place to}} live for various reasons. Some (like the Arabian oryx, Bali mynah, rhinoceros hornbill, Mexican gray wolf, and white rhinoceros) participate in captive breeding programs, some (such as the African spotted dogs) have retired from such programs and need a home, some have behavioral problems, and some are being rehabilitated to return to the wild. <b>Animals</b> <b>that</b> are in sanctuary are treated somewhat differently from other animals by the zoo. While normal exhibits balance the needs of the animals with those of visitors (for example, incorporating large viewing areas), the sanctuary exhibits are almost completely focused on the comfort and well-being of the animals.|$|E
5000|$|An easy keeper, easy doer or (British English) good doer is a {{livestock}} <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> {{can live}} on relatively little food. The opposite of an easy keeper {{is a hard}} keeper (poor doer), an <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> is prone to be too thin and has difficulty maintaining adequate weight.|$|R

5|$|A {{daily show}} in which keepers {{demonstrate}} the natural skills of animals {{to an audience of}} visitors. Keepers use positive reinforcement training with every animal, which means that the <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> perform in the shows are never forced into doing tricks. Because of this, the animals used in Animal Antics vary between shows.|$|E
5|$|A {{vampire bat}} has front teeth that are {{specialized}} for cutting {{and the back}} teeth are much smaller than in other bats. The inferior colliculus, {{the part of the}} bat's brain that processes sound, is well adapted to detecting the regular breathing sounds of sleeping <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> serve as its main food source.|$|E
5|$|After 9600 BCE, the area's {{environment}} grew {{warmer and}} drier, {{a change that}} brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> thrive in them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers , though {{it is unclear whether}} they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the atlatl during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance {{at a time when most}} of the region's big game had disappeared from the landscape.|$|E

5|$|Alligators {{have created}} a niche in wet prairies. With their claws and snouts they dig at low spots and create ponds free of {{vegetation}} that remain submerged throughout the dry season. Alligator holes are integral {{to the survival of}} aquatic invertebrates, turtles, fish, small mammals, and birds during extended drought periods. The alligators then feed upon some of the <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> come to the hole.|$|E

5|$|Although Triatominae bugs feed on them, birds {{appear to}} be immune to {{infection}} and therefore are {{not considered to be}} a T. cruzi reservoir. Even when colonies of insects are eradicated from a house and surrounding domestic animal shelters, they can re-emerge from plants or <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> are part of the ancient, sylvatic (referring to wild animals) infection cycle. This is especially likely in zones with mixed open savannah, with clumps of trees interspersed by human habitation.|$|E

5|$|<b>Animals</b> <b>that</b> {{are most}} active {{at dawn and}} dusk, when {{temperatures}} are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued morning and evening light helps make them less visible to predators, but is bright enough {{to allow them to}} locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) {{was brought}} to Southern Florida as an {{ornamental}} shrub and was dispersed by the droppings of birds and other <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> ate its bright red berries. It thrives on abandoned agricultural land growing in forests too dense for wading birds to nest in, similar to melaleucas. It grows rapidly especially after hurricanes and has invaded pineland forests. Following Hurricane Andrew, scientists and volunteers cleared damaged pinelands of Brazilian pepper so the native trees {{would be able to}} return to their natural state.|$|E
5|$|Contact with Americans and Europeans in {{the early}} 19th century brought more {{settlers}} to the island, and had a lasting negative ecological effect. On lower slopes, vast tracts of koa–ōhia forest were converted to farmland. Higher up, feral <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> escaped from ranches found refuge in, and damaged extensively, Mauna Kea's native māmane–naio forest. Non-native plants are the other serious threat; there are over 4,600 introduced species on the island, whereas the number of native species is estimated at just 1,000.|$|E

5|$|F. emasculata and Pinck Pharmaceuticals are fictitious, but {{pharmaceutical}} companies do send scientists {{all over the}} world looking for plants and <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> could have medicinal use. The appearance of The Smoking Man in a stand-alone episode is unusual, as Chris Carter did not like mixing the mythology and stand-alone episodes. Initially, the producers were wary of releasing the episode so close to the release of the similarly-themed movie Outbreak. In the end, however, they realized that the two entities were separate and stood on their own.|$|E
5|$|Fenton and Licht {{note that}} the effect of a rattlesnake's {{rattling}} could be deimatic (startle) in inexperienced animals, whether predators or large <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> might injure the snake by stepping on it, but aposematic (a warning signal) in <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> are aware of the rattle's meaning. They refer to the work of Fenton and his colleague David Bates on the responses of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to the defensive clicks made by moths in the family Arctiidae, which includes the garden tiger moth, Arctia caja. This family includes large, furry, bitter-tasting or poisonous moths. They found that while sounds can startle inexperienced bats, after a few trials the bats ignored the sounds if the prey was edible; but the same sounds can warn experienced bats of bitter-tasting prey (an honest signal).|$|E
5|$|Global {{warming is}} {{expected}} to have a number of negative long-term ecological impacts on the region, including drought, increased forest fires, forest degradation to drought and disease, and less healthy or nonexistent salmon runs. The distribution and survival of plant species, especially those that inhabit alpine environments, as well as <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> are specifically adapted to those environments, will also be adversely affected. Glaciers are also expected to recede due to a decreased buildup of snowpack and higher overall temperatures.|$|E
50|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{advantage of}} this extinction burst is clear. In a natural environment, an <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> persists in a learned behavior, despite not resulting in immediate reinforcement, might {{still have a chance}} of producing reinforcing consequences if the animal tries again. This animal would be at an advantage over another <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> gives up too easily.|$|R
