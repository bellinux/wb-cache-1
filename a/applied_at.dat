5|$|Chemically, the perxenate {{compounds}} {{are used}} as oxidizing agents in analytical chemistry. Xenon difluoride is used as an etchant for silicon, particularly {{in the production of}} microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil can be produced by reacting xenon difluoride with uracil. Xenon is also used in protein crystallography. <b>Applied</b> <b>at</b> pressures from 0.5 to 5MPa (5 to 50atm) to a protein crystal, xenon atoms bind in predominantly hydrophobic cavities, often creating a high-quality, isomorphous, heavy-atom derivative {{that can be used for}} solving the phase problem.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{graduation}} from Purdue, Armstrong {{decided to become}} an experimental research test pilot. He <b>applied</b> <b>at</b> the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base, which was later redesignated as the ‘‘NASA Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center’’ in 2014. Although the committee had no open positions, it forwarded his application to the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland, where Armstrong began working in March 1955. Armstrong's stint at Cleveland lasted a couple of months, and by July 1955 he had returned to Edwards AFB for a new job.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Armstrong <b>applied</b> <b>at</b> a local Methodist church {{to lead a}} Boy Scout troop. When asked for his {{religious}} affiliation, he labeled himself as a deist.

5|$|The {{resonator}} {{shown in}} figure 12 is around 120 μm in length. Experimental complete filters with an operating frequency of 30GHz have been produced using cantilever varactors as the resonator elements. The size of this filter is around 4×3.5mm. Cantilever resonators are typically <b>applied</b> <b>at</b> frequencies below 200MHz, but other structures, such as micro-machined cavities, {{can be used in}} the microwave bands. Extremely high Q resonators can be made with this technology; flexural mode resonators with a Q in excess of 80,000 at 8MHz are reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} known to be toxic to goats; a study {{published}} in the early 1980s revealed that 11 out of 12 goats died after 1 to 40 days of daily oral dosing of Tephrosia apollinea shoots (fresh or dried), and that they displayed adverse reactions to ingesting it such as dyspnoea, weakness of the limbs and joints causing instability in movement, changes in fat composition, catarrhal enteritis, and hemorrhage in the heart, lungs, and intestinal mucosa. Rotenoids extracted from the seeds of the plant also caused complete mortality in Aphis craccivora, when <b>applied</b> <b>at</b> a concentration of 0.1% for 48 hours.|$|E
5|$|A major {{driver of}} human impact on Earth systems is the {{destruction}} of biophysical resources, and especially, the Earth's ecosystems. The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and {{the scale of the}} human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be <b>applied</b> <b>at</b> many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.|$|E

5|$|Besides these {{international}} initiatives, {{some countries}} {{are taking their}} own actions. New Zealand has banned the taking of manta rays since {{the introduction of the}} Wildlife Act in 1953. In June 1995, the Maldives banned the export of all ray species and their body parts, effectively putting a stop to manta fishing as there had not previously been a fishery for local consumption. The government reinforced this in 2009 with the introduction of two marine protected areas. In the Philippines, the taking of mantas was banned in 1998, but this was overturned in 1999 under pressure from local fishermen. Fish stocks were surveyed in 2002, and the ban was reintroduced. The taking or killing of mantas in Mexican waters was prohibited in 2007. This ban may not be strictly enforced, but laws are being more rigidly <b>applied</b> <b>at</b> Isla Holbox, an island off the Yucatán Peninsula, where manta rays are used to attract tourists.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{is used in}} roofing, currency, and for {{photographic}} technology {{known as}} the daguerreotype. Copper was used in Renaissance sculpture, and was used to construct the Statue of Liberty; copper continues {{to be used in}} construction of various types. Copper plating and copper sheathing were widely used to protect the under-water hulls of ships, a technique pioneered by the British Admiralty in the 18th century. The Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant, starting its production in 1876. The German scientist Gottfried Osann invented powder metallurgy in 1830 while determining the metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element (e.g., tin) to copper would affect bell tones. Flash smelting was developed by Outokumpu in Finland and first <b>applied</b> <b>at</b> Harjavalta in 1949; the energy-efficient process accounts for 50% of the world's primary copper production.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was first}} {{designated}} along {{a series of}} roads between Appleton and Minneapolis around 1933. At first these roads were a mixture of gravel and bitumen surfaces, the latter a forerunner of today's asphalt. Within the first year or so, the western end was extended to terminate MN7 in the Ortonville area. In 1958, the highway was extended to its modern western terminus at Beardsley by replacing another trunk highway. The section that is now an expressway in the Twin Cities was expanded by the 1950s, and the whole highway was paved in a hard-surface {{by the end of}} that decade. The highway was truncated in the Twin Cities to its current eastern terminus in the 1980s. The scenic byways designations were <b>applied</b> <b>at</b> the state and federal levels in 1995 and 2002, respectively.|$|E

Hot mix asphalt is <b>applied</b> <b>at</b> temperatures over 300°F (150°C) with a free floating screed. Warm mix asphalt is <b>applied</b> <b>at</b> temperatures of 200–250°F (95–120°C), resulting in reduced energy usage and emissions of volatile organic compounds. Cold mix asphalt is often used on lower-volume rural roads, where hot mix asphalt would cool {{too much on the}} long trip from the asphalt plant to the construction site.|$|E

25|$|An {{orthogonal}} {{array of}} strength 2 {{can be used}} to design a factorial experiment. The columns represent the various factors and the entries are the levels that the factors can be <b>applied</b> <b>at</b> (assuming that all factors can be <b>applied</b> <b>at</b> the same number of levels). An experimental run is a row of the orthogonal array, that is, apply the corresponding factors at the levels which appear in the row.

For example, one recommendation is that an appropriately sized orthogonal array be randomly selected from those available, then randomize the run order.|$|E
