40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} whether seniors understand {{their risk of}} moving to <b>a</b> <b>nursing</b> home. Data Sources. We used longitudinal data from the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) database. AHEAD is a nationally representative survey (n 5 8, 203) of community dwellers aged 701 years and their spouses. StudyDesign. We followed respondents for 5 years from {{the date of the}} first interview fielded in 1993. Our primary dependent variable was whether respondents moved to <b>a</b> <b>nursing</b> homewithin 5 years of baseline; self-assessed probability of moving to <b>a</b> <b>nursing</b> home within 5 years, also assessed at baseline, was the primary explanatory variable. Principal Findings. We found that seniors who believed {{they were more likely to}} move to <b>a</b> <b>nursing</b> home within 5 years were indeed more likely to do so, and that most elders overestimated their likelihood of moving to <b>a</b> <b>nursing</b> home. Conclusions. Low rates of private long-term care insurance are not plausibly a result of seniors underestimating their personal risk of moving to <b>a</b> <b>nursing</b> home; such <b>an</b> assumption is inherent in many strategies to plan for the future long-term care needs o...|$|R
