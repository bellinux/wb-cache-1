5|$|According to his autobiography, it {{was while}} he was in bed with a fever that Wallace thought about Thomas Malthus's idea of {{positive}} checks on human population growth <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with the idea of natural selection. Wallace said in his autobiography that he was on the island of Ternate at the time; but historians have questioned this, saying that {{on the basis of the}} journal he kept at the time, he was on the island of Gilolo. From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode. He used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.|$|E

Julia's daughter, Victoria Elizabeth, born in the Elmswood Nursing Home on 19June 1945, was {{subsequently}} given up for adoption to a Norwegian Salvation Army Captain and his wife (Peder and Margaret Pedersen) after intense pressure from the Stanley family. John Lennon was informed by his Aunt Harriet of her existence in 1964. John was so overcome by emotion, wanting to find his sister, that he placed an ad in the paper, and hired detectives to look for her.

5|$|Aspirin, in {{the form}} of leaves from the willow tree, has been used for its health effects for at least 2,400 years. In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated sodium {{salicylate}} with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. In {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century, other chemists established the chemical structure <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with more efficient methods to make it. In 1897, scientists at Bayer began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for common salicylate medicines. By 1899, Bayer had named the drug Aspirin and was selling it around the world. The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name; however, their rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to competition between many brands and formulations.|$|E
5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980–81 season, Al-Talaba {{won their}} first ever league title after tying with Al-Shorta on both points and goal {{difference}} in the end where the Iraq Football Association declared Al-Talaba as champions due to them having more wins than Al-Shorta, even though Al-Shorta had scored more goals. Hussein Saeed was the top goalscorer of the league with 11 goals in 11 matches out of Al-Talaba's total 19 goals. In the cup, Al-Talaba reached the final {{for the second time}} in the row <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> against Al-Zawra'a and lost again in the final 1–0. In the 1981–82 season, Al-Talaba retained their league title, sitting in 1st at 34 points with Saeed being the second top goalscorer of the league with 11 goals, along with Al-Amana's Ghazi Hashim and behind Al-Zawra'a's Thamer Yousif. They reached the cup final for the third time in the row and lost to Al-Zawra'a again 2–1. The next season, Saeed continued his battle for the top goalscorer in which he scored 17 goals surpassing his teammate, Rahim Hameed, with 8 goals. Al-Talaba finished in 2nd place with one point away from the champions, Salahaddin.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{the team}} {{believed}} {{that they would be}} unable to use the Wolfenstein name due to trademark issues, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with multiple possible titles, only to discover that the original developer, Muse Software, had gone out of business several years earlier and let the trademark lapse, leaving them the option to use the name Wolfenstein 3D. The game concept met with immediate approval from Scott Miller of Apogee, who considered id Software his star developer, and he paid id a US$100,000 advance on the project. Mark Rein, who had been brought on a few months prior as id's probationary president, also sold the idea of doing a retail Wolfenstein project to FormGen, which had published id's December 1991 Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter, overcoming the publisher's concerns over Wolfensteins proposed content. This put id in the unique position of selling simultaneously to the shareware and retail markets.|$|E
5|$|They {{pitched a}} number of live-action ideas to Kanbar and {{proposed}} that he invest in a development division of their company, paying them and covering their rent {{in exchange for a}} significant portion of the rights to any scripts that they might sell. Kanbar however, was interested in a more direct approach, and preferred to focus on trying to produce a single film. He had always been a great admirer of animation and was impressed after being shown a direct-to-DVD computer-animated short film that Cory had made called Wobots. He suggested the possibility of producing an animated feature with them that would tell a familiar story with a twist, and gave them a month to come up with a story idea. Kanbar had expressed interest in Cinderella or Pinocchio, but the Edwards brothers did not like these ideas as they had already been done by Walt Disney. A few days after the brothers' initial meeting with Kanbar, Todd found inspiration in non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon, Pulp Fiction, Run Lola Run, and Memento <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with the idea of telling the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood as a police investigation, using multiple points of view.|$|E
5|$|Banks faced {{competition}} from five other goalkeepers, including 30-year-old Scotland international John Anderson and 25-year-old Dave MacLaren. He started the 1959–60 {{season as the}} reserve team's goalkeeper. This in effect made him the club's second choice, ahead of four of his rivals but behind first team choice MacLaren. He had played four reserve team games when MacLaren picked up an injury, and manager Matt Gillies selected Banks for his Leicester debut against Blackpool at Filbert Street on 9 September. The match finished 1–1, with Jackie Mudie's strike cancelling out Ken Leek's opener. Banks retained his place for the 2–0 loss to Newcastle United at St James' Park three days later. With McLaren fit again, Banks {{was sent back to}} the reserves but, after the first team conceded 14 goals in the next five games, he was recalled and became the first-choice goalkeeper {{for the remainder of the}} season. The defensive record did not improve at first, with Banks conceding six in a heavy defeat by Everton at Goodison Park, but he improved in each match and the Foxes settled for a comfortable 12th-place finish. In training, he worked extensively on improving his weaknesses, such as coming for crosses. He put in extra hours during training <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with practice sessions to improve his skills – this was largely unique in an era where there were no specialized goalkeeping coaches. In the summer, both Anderson and MacLaren departed, leaving Banks as the club's undisputed number one ahead of a group of understudies.|$|E

5|$|Penn State got {{the ball}} to start the game, and drove down the field with {{relative}} ease (facing only one third down) prior to stalling at their 26-yard line and turning the ball over on downs. After an Indiana three and out, Penn State ran another drive {{at the end of}} which they turned over on downs. Each team ran one more drive before Indiana attained first downs on three consecutive plays, ultimately culminating their possession with a five-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Nate Sudfeld to Isaiah Roundtree, making the score 7–0 at the end of the first quarter. Penn State responded on their second drive of the second quarter via a 46-yard pass from Hackenberg to Robinson to tie the game. Later, Mitch Ewald kicked a short field goal to re-take the lead. Penn State had a chance to tie the game again when kicker Sam Ficken attempted a 42-yard field goal, but Indiana blocked the kick, and with their ensuing momentum drove down the field at the end of the half, ultimately ending with Ewald hitting a field goal as time expired. After halftime, Indiana ran a quick drive on which they punted before Penn State ran a 13-play, 80-yard drive that concluded with Robinson catching his second touchdown of the game, a 26-yard pass from Hackenberg. Indiana responded with a quick score; they converted a two-point conversion to take a 21–14 lead. Late in the third quarter, Hackenberg threw a fade pattern to Robinson in the corner of the end zone, which Robinson corralled, but he landed on his back out of bounds, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> either with the wind knocked out, or some sort of back injury. Penn State settled for a field goal, and at the end of three, Indiana led 21–17. The fourth quarter entrenched the Hoosiers' lead, as they totaled 23 points to only 7 for Penn State, winning the game 44–24, their final score coming on a safety.|$|E
