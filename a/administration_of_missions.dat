The Board comprised three representatives each from the Mission, parent body and the local education office and past students.

5000|$|On June 23, 1768, the <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> the Dominican <b>missions</b> in Bataan was {{transferred}} to the Secular Clergy.

In Orani, it was Padre Bernardo de Aragón, O.P. who turned over the Parish to the secular priest Fr. Faustino Bautista, who had to sign an inventory of items belonging to the church and the Virgin. In 1806, a small [...] "carillon" [...] (musical instrument housed in the church belfry) was installed.

50|$|The {{expulsion}} of the Jesuits from Portugal {{has been seen}} as a quarrel with Prime Minister Sebastião de Melo, Marquis of Pombal.

By a secret treaty of 1750, Portugal relinquished to Spain the contested colony of Colónia do Sacramento {{at the mouth of the}} Uruguay River in exchange for the Seven Reductions of Paraguay, the autonomous Jesuit missions that had been nominal Spanish colonial territory. The Jesuits, disagreeing with transfers of Guaraní populations from one territory to another, caused the Guaraní War and Portugal, fearing an attempt to build an independent empire in the New World, forbade the Jesuits to continue the local <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> their former <b>missions.</b> Portuguese Jesuits were removed from the court.|$|R

40|$|The {{definition}} <b>of</b> the <b>mission</b> and {{the role}} of a library {{plays an important role in}} the <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> libraries. It's important for the users of libraries to know their role so that they can form more realistic and fairer expectations. However if there is no connection between the definition <b>of</b> the <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> library and its direction, there is no point in trying to determine it's mission. The rapid development of the technology of computing as well as the methods of keeping and transmitting information have affected the traditional model <b>of</b> library <b>administration.</b> The model <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> quality offers a frame within which the management of libraries lies from the sheer realisation <b>of</b> its <b>mission</b> to the action and fulfilment of their goals. The <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> quality is a field that is worth drawing attention to. The philosophy and the methods <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> quality started being implemented ever since the usefulness of libraries itself needed to be justified, as well as since private documentation centres and service centres appeared. The sure thing is that there is an activity in the field of libraries about matters_ that concern the <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> quality. Shifting from the theory to more systematic methods <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> quality is important, there is also a growing concern for research in this field, so that methods and philosophies <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> quality, that can be implemented for libraries, can be found...|$|R
