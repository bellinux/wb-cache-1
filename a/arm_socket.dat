50|$|Shadow Rokuro-Kubi: Appears in episode 13. Powers {{include a}} 2-meter neck used for coiling, teleporting {{individuals}} near her, remote controlled arms, neck detachment called the Rokuro Hammer, and two machine guns in each <b>arm</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|E
50|$|Originally {{scheduled}} to begin in December 1949, filming was postponed when Costello had to undergo an operation for a gangrenous gall bladder in November 1949. Filming eventually began on April 28, 1950, and ended on May 29, 1950. Despite having a stunt double, Costello did his own wrestling in the film, only to be rewarded with a wrenched <b>arm</b> <b>socket</b> and a stretched tendon.|$|E
50|$|The <b>arm</b> <b>socket</b> faces {{backwards}} and downwards from a bone {{in the shoulder}} girdle called the coracoid, suggesting that the arms were held beneath the body. The large articular surface {{on the head of}} the humerus implies that the arms had a wide range of movement, but restricted to a parasagittal axis. The deltopectoral crest {{on the front of the}} humerus would have anchored large arm muscles to bring the arm forward while walking. Modern crocodilians also have a deltopectoral crest, but it is positioned laterally and anchors to muscles that pull the arms up to the sides, not forward. The muscle thought to have facilitated forward movement in Stratiotosuchus is called the deltoideus clavicularis; it is also present in modern crocodilians, which use it for high walking.|$|E
50|$|At nearly {{6 metres}} high, the Amitābha Buddha {{is the largest}} ancient Chinese statue in the West. Although largely intact, the now missing hands would have been fixed into the <b>arm</b> <b>sockets</b> by dowels. The right hand would have been raised in the gesture of fearlessness (abhayamudra), and the left hand lowered in the gesture of bestowal (varadamudra). The figure was carved in high relief to reveal {{garments}} with very flat folds, which was typical of figurative art in the Sui period. The whole statue stands on a massive lotus base with a dedicatory inscription in Chinese. Traces of red paint have also been found on the back. The Amitābha Buddha was originally flanked by a smaller standing bodhisattva that {{is now in the}} Tokyo National Museum.|$|R
2500|$|The {{shoulder}} girdle is only partly known but {{appears to be}} typical for plesiosaurs. It includes fused clavicles at the anterior end, scapulae (shoulder blades), and large coracoids. The scapulae and coracoids both contribute to the glenoids (<b>arm</b> <b>sockets).</b> A pair of oval holes called pectoral fenestrae are found midway along the scapular/coracoid contacts. The forelimbs are elongate and relatively narrow compared to those of most plesiosaurs. The humerus (upper arm bone) has distinctive curvature, {{which appears to be}} a retained primitive feature among sauropterygians. Mature Plesiosaurus also have a distinctive groove along the ventral surface of the humerus. The forearm includes a flat, broad, crescent-shaped ulna and a [...] "robust and pillar-like" [...] radius. The wrist includes six bones. The hand paddle has five digits; the phalangeal formula is uncertain, but the count for one large individual, from [...] "thumb" [...] to fifth [...] "finger", is 4-8-9-8-6.|$|R
5000|$|Current body-powered <b>arms</b> contain <b>sockets</b> {{that are}} built from hard epoxy or carbon fiber. These sockets or [...] "interfaces" [...] {{can be made}} more {{comfortable}} by lining them with a softer, compressible foam material that provides padding for the bone prominences. A self suspending or supra-condylar socket design is useful for those with short to mid range below elbow absence. Longer limbs may {{require the use of}} a locking roll-on type inner liner or more complex harnessing to help augment suspension.|$|R
50|$|Capstan A {{vertical}} {{metal or}} wooden winch secured to the foredeck of a ship, used for hoisting the anchor. Capstans may be manually operated or powered hydraulically or electrically. A traditional wooden capstan is fitted with removable wooden <b>arms</b> fitted into <b>sockets</b> {{on which the}} seaman push. Seashanties were often chanted to keep the seamen together as they pushed.|$|R
60|$|The shipowner's son {{tried to}} do as bidden. But now a new {{difficulty}} presented itself. In his eagerness to hold the halter Phil had twisted it about his hand and wrist. Now it {{was caught in the}} very flesh and almost pulling one <b>arm</b> from its <b>socket,</b> as he tried to make his own horse hold back.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, my dear sir," [...] {{returned}} the doctor, with animation, [...] "you are quite wrong. The eye, indeed, {{can never be}} restored, though it will partially close, and become so familiar {{to you and your}} friends that it will almost cease to be noticed or remembered; but we shall have a stump made for the lower <b>arm,</b> with a <b>socket</b> to which {{you will be able to}} fix a fork or a spoon, or--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let him go," [...] snarled Gian Maria, out of patience. The men {{released}} the rope, and allowed some {{three feet of}} it to run through their hands. Then they grasped it again, so that Peppe's sudden fall was as suddenly arrested by a jerk that almost wrenched his <b>arms</b> from their <b>sockets.</b> A shriek broke from him at that exquisite torture, and he was dragged once more to the full height of the canopy.|$|R
5000|$|He {{made the}} wings from zephyr cloth mounted on steel tubes, forming a large web under each arm which was clasped to his hips. A {{feature of the}} wings was a device {{to prevent them from}} opening out too far and ripping his <b>arms</b> from their <b>sockets.</b> A loose cloth formed another web between his legs, which acted like a bird's tail. His large goggles gave him an {{appearance}} which led to his becoming known as [...] "The Batman" [...] or [...] "The Batwing Jumper".|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll do," [...] he said. [...] "It is {{an awkward}} shot, for it has broken the {{shoulder}} bone {{and carried a}} portion away, but with quiet and care you will get the use of your arm again. You are lucky, for if it had gone two inches to the left it would have smashed the <b>arm</b> at the <b>socket,</b> and two inches {{the other way and}} it would have been all up with you. Now lie quiet for awhile; you can do nothing for your brother at present. It may be hours before he recovers consciousness." ...|$|R
40|$|The typical problem {{patient has}} a {{transhumeral}} amputation 30 to 60 mm below the axilla. No {{matter how well}} the socket is made, the moment <b>arm</b> in the <b>socket</b> is too little to sustain the four foot-pound torque of a typical advanced prosthesis when working out in front. Matters get worse if the prosthetic terminal device carries a load. A prosthesis that solves this problem must compensate for the gravitational torque generated by the prosthesis itself so that all user generated torque {{can be used to}} position the prosthesis and to support the terminal device loa...|$|R
60|$|It {{was evident}} that Bradshaw, able {{exponent}} {{of the art of}} fiction that he was, must have excelled himself on this occasion. I tried to get the story out of him in the study that evening. White and Kendal assisted. We tried persuasion first. That having failed, we tried taunts. Then we tried kindness. Kendal sat on his legs, and I sat on his head, and White twisted his arm. I think that we should have extracted something soon, either his <b>arm</b> from its <b>socket</b> or a full confession, but we were interrupted. The door flew open, and Prater (the same being our House-master, and rather a good sort) appeared.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the name}} implies, {{movement}} of the shoulder is severely restricted in people with a [...] "frozen shoulder". This condition, which doctors call adhesive capsulitis, is frequently caused by injury that leads to lack of use due to pain. Rheumatic disease progression and recent shoulder surgery can also cause frozen shoulder. Intermittent periods of use may cause inflammation. Adhesions (abnormal bands of tissue) grow between the joint surfaces, restricting motion. There is also a lack of synovial fluid, which normally lubricates {{the gap between the}} <b>arm</b> bone and <b>socket</b> to help the shoulder joint move. It is this restricted space between the capsule and ball of the humerus that distinguishes adhesive capsulitis from a less complicated painful, stiff shoulder. People with diabetes, stroke, lung disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and heart disease, or who have been in an accident, are at a higher risk for frozen shoulder. The condition rarely appears in people under the age of 40.|$|R
50|$|Addiction is {{the strongest}} and most {{dangerous}} side-effect of dranath. As more of the drug is used, more of the drug is needed to satisfy the craving. Abstinance from the drug causes headaches, a swelling tongue, shaking limbs, aversion to brightness, and a chill {{as well as an}} overall ache and fatigue. In extreme cases of fighting the addiction, the victim is nearly insensible. Severe withdrawal causes unconsciousness, memory lapses, vivid and sexually explicit dreams, an itching sensation inside and out, vomiting, cramps, sweating, a foul smell, and deep, gut-twisting agony. The pain of withdrawal in these cases can drive the victim to injure him- or herself in the attempt to get more dranath or to escape the pain. If tied down, the victim's flailing might pull his/her <b>arms</b> from their <b>sockets.</b> He/She might also bite their tongue off. The culmination of all the withdrawal effects eventually weakens the body to the point of total exhaustion. At this point the heart may give out; if it does, then unless the heart restarts (often by CPR) and the victim is able to breathe, he or she will die at long last.|$|R
2500|$|Amplified Mobility Platform is an MK-6 vehicle {{redesigned}} for Pandora's {{hostile environment}} that is worn and controlled as a large [...] "mech" [...] motorized suit. They are [...] exoskeletons powered by ceramic turbines. Soldiers at Hell's Gate use these for patrol and for battle. AMP suits are controlled via a semi-master-slave system – with the AMP's arm motion slaved to the pilot's arm motion. Motion-sensing gloves worn by the pilot are used to control the AMP arms – the result being that the AMP's arm movements exactly match the pilot's movement. In their military role, AMP's are usually armed with 30mm GAU-90 autocannons, (occasionally equipped with a blade below the barrel, allowing the AMP to cut its way through denser foliage without putting the weapon aside) which the suit deploys as a soldier or Marine would hold and use a rifle. There is an ammo belt that extends into the gun, into an ammo canister on the shoulder, over the <b>arm,</b> into a <b>socket</b> at the back. The GAU-90 fires 350 rounds per minute. The AMP suit has GPS, thermal imaging display, FLIR, and radar. Stan Winston Studios animator and Avatar Design Supervisor John Rosengrant described the AMP suit as [...] "An Apache helicopter with legs". It also has a ceramic knife that is three feet long. Quaritch owns an AMP suit and has named it [...] "Beyond Glory". Its GAU-90 has a dragon painted on the ammo tube.|$|R
500|$|Over 50 {{characters}} from the films are playable {{over the course}} of the game, including variations of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, R2-D2, C-3PO, Darth Vader, Wicket the Ewok, and Boba Fett. Character abilities have a greater role in Lego Star Wars II than in Lego Star Wars. Certain characters armed with guns can use a grappling hook in predesignated areas. Characters wielding lightsabers can deflect projectiles, [...] and use the Force. R2-D2, C-3PO, and other droid characters are needed to open certain doors. Small characters like the Ewok and Jawa can crawl through hatches to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Bounty hunters, such as Boba Fett, may use thermal detonators to destroy otherwise indestructible objects. Sith, like Darth Vader, can use the Force to manipulate black Lego objects. Some characters have unique abilities; for example, Chewbacca can rip enemies' <b>arms</b> from their <b>sockets,</b> Darth Vader can choke enemies with the Force, Princess Leia possesses a slap attack, and Lando Calrissian can use a kung-fu-like attack. Special abilities are often necessary to unlock secrets, and story mode does not always provide characters with needed abilities. [...] This means that some secrets can only be found in free play mode. The player can unlock the [...] "Use Old Save" [...] extra, which imports all unlocked {{characters from}} Lego Star Wars for use in free play; however, a Lego Star Wars saved game must be present on the same memory card that contains Lego Star Wars IIs save data.|$|R
40|$|Rotator cuff {{deficiency}} with glenohumeral arthritis {{presents a}} unique {{challenge to the}} orthopaedic surgeon. Under these conditions, total shoulder replacement has yielded poor results {{as a result of}} eccentric loading of the glenoid leading to loosening and early failure. Multiple procedures have been recommended to resolve this problem including total shoulder arthroplasty, shoulder arthrodesis, and hemiarthroplasty. Hemiarthroplasty, the current standard of care for this condition, offers only limited goals for functional improvement and only a modest improvement in pain. Recently, there has been renewed interest in reverse shoulder arthroplasty. The main concept behind the reverse shoulder implant is the stabilization of the joint by replacing the head of the <b>arm</b> with a <b>socket</b> and placing a ball on the shoulder side. This 2 ̆ 2 reverse 2 ̆ 2 configuration creates a fixed fulcrum through which the deltoid can act more efficiently at raising the arm and thus increasing range of motion and returning the patient to a more normal level of function. This dissertation attempts to fill in some of the gaps in reverse basic science with six published studies. The important results found in these studies were: (1) Implantation of the glenosphere with an inferior tilt reduces the incidence of mechanical failure of the baseplate. (2) A positive linear correlation is present between abduction range of motion (ROM) and center of rotation offset (CORO). (3) When comparing several factors affecting ROM and scapular impingement, CORO had the largest effect on ROM, followed by glenosphere position. Neck-shaft angle had the largest effect on inferior scapular impingement, followed by glenosphere position. (4) Stability is determined primarily by increasing joint compressive forces and, to a lesser extent, by increasing humerosocket depth. (5) There are three distinct classes of arc of motion relative to the articular constraint: I - arc of motion decreased with increased constraint, II - arc of motion with a complex relationship to constraint, and III - arc of motion increased with increased constraint. The information presented in this dissertation may be useful to the orthopaedic surgeon when deciding on an appropriate reverse implant and improving surgical technique, as well as aiding engineers in improving reverse implant design...|$|R
