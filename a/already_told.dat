5|$|Evan loads {{hundreds}} of animals onto the Ark {{in front of}} {{hundreds of}} spectators and live news crews, who continue to mock him. Later, Long and the policemen arrive with a wrecking ball crew to try and destroy the ark, since it violates numerous building codes in Prestige Crest. When the wrecking crew threatens to demolish the ark within three minutes, a brief rainstorm occurs, prompting some of the spectators to leave. The rain also prevents the crew from proceeding, buying Evan a little time. Evan connects Long's profiteering ethics and what God had <b>already</b> <b>told</b> him about the original form of Prestige Crest, and realizes that the dam under Long Lake had violated building codes and will likely prepare to burst. Evan warns to those present must immediately board the ark, and many have do so when the prophesied flood is triggered soon after the dam bursts. Prestige Crest is catastrophically destroyed, and the ark later rides the flood through the streets and landmarks of Washington, D.C.. The ark reaches its final destination {{in front of the}} Capitol, which disrupts the vote on the Public Land Act bill. Long becomes outraged that the flood did really happen. Evan informs Long that the flood was actually caused by his poor design of the dam, which prompts the other Congressmen also present to turn against Long.|$|E

He is torn between the need {{to tell the truth}} and the desire to protect his friends; his anger leads to the breakdown of his relationships with both Rachel and Diane. Despite Jared's silence, police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days.

Ricko confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims it was an accident – that she hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has <b>already</b> <b>told</b> police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of mateship.

5|$|Becky tells Steve {{that she}} is {{pregnant}} and he later discovers that Becky has <b>already</b> <b>told</b> Claire and Steve tells his mother, Liz. Unfortunately Becky miscarries twice, although she was unaware of her 2nd pregnancy, and medical tests reveal an abnormality of the womb, meaning she is unable to carry a child full-term, making Becky decide {{that she wants to}} adopt. During the process, Steve needs a reference from Amy's mother, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), who promptly uses it to cause trouble, making Becky threaten, in return, that Tracy will never see Amy again. Unfortunately Becky and Steve are refused the right to adopt because her estranged half-sister Kylie gave a bad reference and the fact that Social Services feel that it is too soon after her miscarriages. She confronts Kylie, but the sisters eventually reconcile and Becky helps Kylie reclaim custody of her son, Max. Becky becomes very attached to Max, whilst Kylie becomes more irresponsible. Kylie announces plans to move to Cyprus with her new boyfriend and Becky begs her to reconsider, so Kylie offers to sell Max to her and Steve for £20,000, which they agree to. On the night of the tram crash, Kylie returns and demands more money, so Becky steals £5,000 from the ruins of Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) corner shop, to pay Kylie off.

Although Khánh had <b>already</b> <b>told</b> CIA agent Lucien Conein (who helped to plan the coup against Diệm) in December 1963 {{that he intended to}} hold a coup, it was filed away among the many political rumour documents that were received by the American representatives. Following the coup, he was promoted by the Americans as South Vietnam's new hope.|$|E
25|$|Gott, the XIII Corps commander, {{appointed}} Major-General Klopper of the 2nd South African Division {{commander of}} the Tobruk garrison. In addition to the two South African brigades, he had the 201st Guards (Motorised) Brigade, 11th Indian Infantry Brigade, 32nd Army Tank Brigade and the 4th Anti-Aircraft Brigade. Tobruk had withstood a siege of nine months, before being relieved by Operation Crusader in December 1941. Allied leaders {{expected it to be}} able to hold out for two months with the supplies in the fortress. Auchinleck viewed the defence of Tobruk as non-essential and had <b>already</b> <b>told</b> Neil Ritchie that he did not intend to hold it at all costs.|$|E

He takes {{her to the}} Baxters, who, in turn, arrange to return her to the Rojos in exchange for Antonio. During the exchange, Marisol's son, Jesús, runs towards her, followed by her husband, Julio.

25|$|It is {{possible}} that Lightfoot stayed in the team at times when his batting average drooped due to his ability to 'bowl a bit'. Despite such droops, particularly in the mid-1960s, he managed some very productive batting seasons, especially 1962 when he scored 1,795 runs for Northamptonshire including 5 hundreds. He also managed two career-reviving seasons in 1968 and 1969, reaching 1,000 runs in each. In the years in between colleagues {{felt that it was}} a lack of 'drive' which held him back. He took a benefit in 1970, having <b>already</b> <b>told</b> the club {{that he would not be}} staying in the game for the following season, only to swap his bat for a heavy roller at the County Ground three years later.|$|E
25|$|Shach {{resigned}} from the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah ("Council of Torah Greats") following tensions {{between him and the}} Gerer Rebbe, Rabbi Simcha Bunim Alter (d. 1992). In the Eleventh Knesset elections of 1984, Shach had <b>already</b> <b>told</b> his supporters to vote for Shas instead of Agudat Yisrael. Some perceived the schism as the reemergence of the dissent between Hasidim and Mitnagdim, as Shach represented the Lithuanian Torah world, while the Gerer Rebbe was among the most important Hasidic Rebbes and represented the most significant Hasidic court in Agudat Yisrael. However, it would not be accurate to base the entire conflict on a renewal of the historic dispute between Hasidim and Mitnagdim which began {{in the latter half of}} the eighteenth century.|$|E
25|$|As Harkins and Felt {{prepared}} to leave, Diệm took Lodge aside {{for an individual}} discussion and repeatedly asked what the Americans wanted, repeating his request for 20 minutes. This was a trick on Diem's part, as the fake coup was about to start. In reference to a United Nations inquiry over his repression of the Buddhists, Diệm claimed that Buddhists had been brainwashed by the Americans. Diệm claimed he had closed the pagodas because among the students were communists about to throw grenades and perpetrate bombings during the UN visit. The president also claimed that some Americans were planning a coup against him and promised to give Lodge names. The American ambassador replied with a poker face that he was committed to removing any of his countrymen {{who were involved in}} plotting, even though he was doing so himself. Lodge was not taken in by Diệm, as Washington had <b>already</b> <b>told</b> Diệm what reforms were necessary, such as the removal of Nhu {{and the use of the}} special forces to fight communists rather than dissidents; Diệm had not responded to US advice. Lodge knew that the real coup was in the offing and did not want to stop it, even if Diệm's overtures were genuine.|$|E

60|$|Richard {{had thought}} over {{whether it would}} be better to soften his story, but as it had <b>already</b> been <b>told</b> to the squire, he had {{concluded}} that there would be more danger in contradicting his first version than in sticking to it.

500|$|Pronouns {{are used}} to refer to {{entities}} deictically or anaphorically. A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation — for example the pronoun I identifies the speaker, and the pronoun you, the addressee. Anaphorical pronouns such as that refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience, for example in the sentence I <b>already</b> <b>told</b> you that. The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase (e.g. [...] "he sent it to himself" [...] or [...] "she braced herself for impact").|$|E
