5000|$|In the 1950s and 60s, {{the term}} [...] "air doctor" [...] {{was first used}} to refer to the {{non-contact}} method of debris blow-off using compressed air. The printing and textile industries were some of the largest users of air doctors at that time. They often needed wide paths of air from a compressed air system to control the thickness of liquids on a surface, or to blow debris off the surface of materials prior to the next process. Other terms used were air bar, air squeegee, air curtain, air jet, air blast, <b>air</b> <b>blow</b> <b>off,</b> air nozzle, air comb, air blade and air doctor blade. Today the most commonly used term is simply [...] "air knife".|$|E

50|$|Some laurel {{forests are}} {{a type of}} cloud forest. Cloud forests are found on {{mountain}} slopes where the dense moisture from the sea or ocean is precipitated as warm moist <b>air</b> masses <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> the ocean are forced upwards by the terrain, which cools the air mass to the dew point. The moisture in the air condenses as rain or fog, creating a habitat characterized by cool, moist conditions {{in the air and}} soil. The resulting climate is wet and mild, with the annual oscillation of the temperature moderated by the proximity of the ocean.|$|R
40|$|High‐resolution {{surveys of}} oceanographic and {{atmospheric}} conditions {{made during the}} winter over the inner shelf off northwest Australia are {{used to examine the}} coastal ocean response to large outgoing heat and freshwater fluxes. Relatively cool, low‐humidity <b>air</b> <b>blows</b> <b>off</b> the Australian continent out over the tropical continental shelf, resulting in a large mean latent heat flux (− 177 Wm− 2) that overwhelms insolation and, along with the outgoing long‐wave radiation, results in substantial net cooling (− 105 W m− 2) and evaporative freshwater flux (0. 6 cm d− 1). The inner shelf is characterized by increasingly cool, salty, and dense waters onshore, with a strong front near the 25 m isobath. The front is evident in satellite sea surface temperature (SST) imagery along the majority of the northwest Australian shelf, exhibiting a complex filamentary and eddy structure. Cross‐shelf buoyancy fluxes estimated from the mean, two‐dimensional heat and salt budgets are comparable to parameterizations of cross‐shelf eddy driven fluxes; however, the same fluxes can be achieved by cross‐shelf transports in the bottom boundary layer of about 0. 5 m 2 s− 1 (and an overlying return flow) ...|$|R

Then came the hail again, 'If you don't answer I will sink you,' whereupon the skipper of the lugger shouted out, 'the Jennie of Portsmouth.' 'Lend a hand, lads, with the sails,' he whispered to us; 'slip the cable, Tom.' We ran up the sails in a jiffy, you may be sure, and all the sharper that, as they were half-way up, four guns flashed out. One hulled the lugger, the others flew overhead. Close as they were {{they could not have}} seen us, for we could scarce see them and we were under the shadow of the cliffs, but I suppose they fired at the voices. 'Sink the tubs, lads,' the skipper said as the lugger glided away from us. There was a nice little <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> shore, and she shot away into the {{darkness}} in no time. We all rowed into the mouth of the cove for shelter, and were only just in time, for a shower of grape splashed the water up a few yards behind us.|$|R
40|$|Dust from worker,s clothes {{has been}} shown to be a {{problematic}} source of personal dust exposure. A recently completed effort between NIOSH and the Unimin Corporation has resulted in a quick and effective way to clean worker clothing. The process involves a booth under negative pressure with an air spray manifold to supply compressed <b>air</b> to <b>blow</b> <b>off</b> the dust from the clothing. The overall system is designed to meet MSHA and OSHA requirements. Results of field testing indicated that the manifold cleaned the clothes 10 times faster and removed 50 % more dust than cleaning methods used by workers today...|$|R

This warm air has a moderating effect on the mesoclimate, protecting the tender buds from potentially damaging frosts.|$|R
50|$|Edwin Links second Man in Sea {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} June-July 1964 in the Berry Islands (a chain in the Bahamas) with Sténuit and Jon Lindbergh, one of the sons of Charles Lindbergh, who made the first solo nonstop flight across the Atlantic. Sténuit and Lindbergh stayed in the SPID habitat (Submersible, Portable, Inflatable Dwelling) for 49 hours underwater {{at a depth of}} 432 feet, breathing a helium-oxygen mixture. Dr. Joseph B. MacInnis participated in this dive as a life support specialist. At the end of the two divers decompression, a Sea Diver crew member and Sténuits wife, Annie Sténuit, sustained minor injuries when the end of an <b>air</b> tank <b>blew</b> <b>off.</b> Sténuit, who had developed a case of the bends during decompression, still had some lingering symptoms afterwards in his shoulders and ankles, but these eventually dissipated.|$|R
5000|$|Ramona was {{transferred}} to the Fraser River to replace the steamer Edgar. [...] On April 17, 1901, while in service on the Fraser River, Ramona 's boiler exploded, killing at least four people. The incident occurred at Fort Langley. Two were mothers who had gone on deck for fresh <b>air.</b> They were <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> the boat into the river where they presumably drowned. They had both left their babies in the main cabin; these infants were unharmed. Two deckhands were killed by flying pieces of the boiler. Contemporaneous reports stated that seven additional people suffered what appeared to be fatal injuries.|$|R
5000|$|There {{have been}} various {{explanations}} {{for the use of}} the name [...] "steam beer". According to Anchor Brewing, the name [...] "steam" [...] came from the fact that the brewery had no way to effectively chill the boiling wort using traditional means. So they pumped the hot wort up to large, shallow, open-top bins on the roof of the brewery so that it would be rapidly chilled by the cool <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> in <b>off</b> the Pacific Ocean. Thus while brewing, the brewery had a distinct cloud of steam around the roof let off by the wort as it cooled, hence the name. Another explanation is that the carbon dioxide pressure produced by the 19th-century steam-beer-making process was very high, and that it may have been necessary as part of the process to let off [...] "steam" [...] before attempting to dispense the beer. It is also possible that the name or brewing process derive from Dampfbier (literally steam beer), a traditional German beer that was also fermented at unusually high temperatures and that may have been known to 19th-century American brewers, many of whom were of German descent; Dampfbier is an ale, however, not a lager.|$|R
50|$|Cortegada has an {{oceanic climate}} with warm summers, and cool mild winters.The dense {{moisture}} from the ocean is precipitating constantly. Warm moist <b>air</b> masses <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> the ocean are forced upwards by the terrain, which cools the air mass to the dew point, causing the moisture {{in the air to}} condense as rain or fog, creating a habitat characterized by cool, moist conditions in the air and soil. The resulting climate is wetter and mild, with the annual oscillation of the temperature moderated by the ocean. It has two main fresh water sources: a seasonal lagoon and subterranean fresh water. This last source is peculiar since the island is surrounded by salt water, everybody can dig a well without effort even near the beach, without the need of digging further than several tens of centimetres, around ten inches at the most. The island is almost flat, its highest elevation is 22 feet high. It has an area of 54 hectares of land with a rectangle shape. Due to the large amount of water in the terrain, it flows in streams everywhere or stay quiet in ponds and puddles. The water drips, cover and soak the plants, rocks, soil, logs, moss etc. and still the water is being impassable the island during heavy rain. However the beauty of the set make it a tourist attraction.|$|R

40|$|The new {{flashlamp}} {{is tested}} and its condensorlens designed. The {{set up with}} a condensoriens of 40 (mm) is satisfactory for black and white photos. For pictures in colour a condensoriens of 21. 5 (mm) is needed. Four films with black and white photos are made to analyze the flow around the Brite 22 N blade. Some photos are unsharp, because the lightbeam was not parallel to the blades. The von Karman frequency is obtained for machnumbers ranging from 0. 4 till to 0. 95 and with or without air coming out off the blades. Above Ma &# 61 1 the flow is shocked and the von Karman frequency is not detectable. Without air coming out off the blades, the obtained Strouhalnumber is about 0. 37. The expected number ranges from 0. 1 till 0. 25. If <b>air</b> is <b>blown</b> out <b>off</b> the blades, {{the thickness of the}} blade is split in two parts by the flow. Therefore the calculated Strouhalnumber is too large if the thickness isn't corrected. The R. M. S. value of the differences in the lightintensity is caused by the vortices in the wakeflow and is recorded at Ma &# 61 0. 7 and at 1, 2, 4 and 7 (mm) behind the blade. If the distance to the blade increases, the wakeflow becomes wider and the intensity decreases. The position of the largest R. M. S. value is dependent on the distancebehind the blade and whether <b>air</b> is <b>blown</b> out or not, because it is blown out at another angle as the surrounding flow...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Eskom {{is under}} {{increasing}} pressure to provide reliable and sustainable electricity. Demand Side Management (DSM), offers a short– to medium–term {{solution to this}} problem. During 2009, the mining sector consumed approximately 16 % of the domestic electricity supplied by Eskom. This made the mining sector {{one of the major}} targets for Eskom–initiated DSM programmes. The mining industry uses compressed air {{for a wide variety of}} applications and production purposes. This creates many opportunities to reduce electricity consumption and operating costs. Reducing the airsystem demand may however not result in significant electrical energy savings, unless the compressed–air supply is accurately managed to meet the reduced demand. Until recently, compressor control in the mining sector generally consisted of operating the compressors continuously, regardless of the actual demand for compressed air. Excessive compressed <b>air</b> is <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> into the atmosphere resulting in energy loss. This usually occurs when the compressors are operated manually. A computer–controlled compressor management solution, which optimises the efficiency potential of the compressed–air supply, is required to obtain significant electrical energy savings. The need for such a solution was addressed by the development of an energy management solution for mine compressor systems. This solution is referred to as Energy Management System (EMS) and is capable of starting, stopping, loading and unloading compressors. In addition to this, compressor output can be controlled to maintain a desired pressure set–point. In this study, the development and implementation of EMS on ten different mine compressor systems is presented. Automatic compressor capacity control was implemented, while an operator manually initiated compressor starting; stopping; loading and unloading, according to EMS control schedules. Centralised compressor control is one of the main advantages offered by EMS, especially for compressed–air systems with multiple compressor systems at different geographic locations. EMS facilitated effective and sustainable electrical energy reductions for all these compressed–air systems. Master...|$|R
