40|$|Dopamine is an {{important}} neuromodulator in both vertebrates and invertebrates. We have found that reduced dopamine signaling can cause a distinct abnormality {{in the behavior of}} the nematode C. elegans, which has only eight dopaminergic neurons. Using an automated particle-tracking system for the analysis of C. elegans locomotion, we observed that individual wild-type animals made small adjustments to their speed to maintain constant rates of locomotion. By contrast, individual mutant animals defective in the synthesis of dopamine made larger adjustments to their speeds, resulting in large fluctuations in their rates of locomotion. Mutants defective in dopamine signaling also frequently exhibited both abnormally high and <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> average <b>speeds.</b> The ability to make small adjustments to speed was restored to these mutants by treatment with dopamine. These behaviors depended on the D 2 -like dopamine receptor DOP- 3 and the G-protein subunit GOA- 1. We suggest that C. elegans and other animals, including humans, might share mechanisms by which dopamine restricts motor activity levels and coordinates movement. National Science Foundation (U. S.).

The aim of this thesis is a detailed analysis of the concept of <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> tender price {{with regard to the}} case law of administrative courts and the Office for the Protection of Competition. The analysis is made both in relation to the Public Procurement act and the EU Directive on public procurement. After an introductory part the thesis is divided into seven main chapters. The first chapter outlines basic terms necessary for comprehensive analysis of further discussed issues. Chapter two deals with the concept of <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> tender price including its evolution in the former public procurement law. The third chapter focuses on the process of assessment of the tenders concerning the <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> tender price. This chapter deals with the request for explanation of the tenderer's tender price, with requirements of this explanation and with assessment of this explanation made by evaluation committee. Chapter four examines the zero tender price and the case law of administrative courts regarding the correct procedure in case of occurrence of this price. This chapter takes [...] ...|$|R

Limited liability causes firms in a bad financial situation to bid more aggressively than good firms in the procurement auction. Therefore, {{it is more likely}} that the winning firm is a firm in financial difficulties with a high risk of bankruptcy. The paper {{analyzes the}} different regulatory practices to face this problem with a special emphasis on surety bonds used e. g. in the US. We characterize the optimal surety bond and show that it does not coincide with the current US regulation. In particular we show that under a natural assumption the US regulation is too expensive and provides overinsurance to the problem of <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> tenders.

40|$|Evapotranspiration (ET) is an {{important}} component of the wetland water budget. Water level declines in Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, have caused concerns, especially during low water levels. However, how wetland ET and its partitioning respond to <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> water levels is unclear. In this study, wetland ET was estimated with MODIS data and meteorological data. The wetland ET partitioning and its relationship with <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> water levels were analyzed for 2000 – 2013. The results showed that the water evaporation rate (Ewater) was larger than the land ET rate (ETland); the ETland/Ewater ranged from 0. 77 to 0. 99. When the water level was below 12. 8 [*]m, the ET partition ratio was larger than 1, which indicates that wetland ET comes from land surface ET more than water evaporation. The negative standardized water level index (SWI) was used to represent an <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> water level in the wetland. Although the monthly wetland ET decreased as the negative SWI decreased, ETland was higher than the average under negative SWI conditions from September to December, when the water level decreased. The <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> water level induced more water loss from the land surface, especially when the water level decreased, which reduced the available water resources along the wetland shore...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of light, water flow and water temperature on larvae and early juveniles of 4 shallow-water Caribbean demosponges, Tedania ignis, Haliclona tubifera, Sigmadocja caerulea and Halichondria magniconulosa. Larval release was not a synchronous event, either at the individual or population level {{in any of these}} species. Parenchymella larvae were photonegative during their whole life, but their swimming speed to escape from a light source varied with species and was related to the ratio of larval body length:flagellar tuft length. The presence of a water flow faster than the larval swimming speed had no effect on the settlement success of these 4 species in experimental flumes. Larvae of all 4 species preferred shaded sites at settlement in flumes. However, microhabitat irradiance in the field was correlated with abundances of adults only in 1 species, S. caerulea. The presence of water flow was positively associated with juvenile survivorship in the field only in the caseof T ignjs. Water flow was also positively associated with the adult abundance of T ignis, but negatively associated with the abundance of H. tubifera. Recruitment varied substantially among species, being extremely low in H. tubifera and H. magniconulosa. Larval activity and settlement of 2 species were strongly affected by <b>abnormally</b> <b>low</b> temperatures: swimming <b>speed</b> decreased, the free-swimming phase was dramatically shortened and recruitment was virtually inhibited. Low temperatures, therefore, potentially prevent larval dispersal and recruitment into cold waters and might restrict the geographic distribution of these species to tropical areas and warm shallow waters.
