5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, <b>abnormal</b> <b>movement,</b> a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E

40|$|Background. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the incidence of, and factors associated with, myoclonus-like <b>abnormal</b> <b>movements</b> of Japanese infants following treatment with midazolam in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Methods. We retrospectively investigated <b>abnormal</b> <b>movements</b> and associated risk factors in Japanese infants (less than 1 year old) who received continuous intravenous midazolam treatment in the NICU of the Neonatal Medical Center, Kumamoto City Hospital, Japan, between April 2007 and March 2009.

Conclusion. The incidence of <b>abnormal</b> <b>movements</b> after midazolam treatment was about 9. 6 % among the Japanese NICU infants.

25|$|Chorea is a continuous, random-appearing {{sequence}} {{of one or}} more discrete involuntary movements or movement fragments. Although chorea consists of discrete movements, many are often strung together in time, thus making it difficult to identify each movement's start and end point. These movements can involve the face, trunk, neck, tongue, and extremities. Unlike dystonic movements, chorea-associated movements are often more rapid, random and unpredictable. Movements are repeated, but not rhythmic in nature. Children with chorea appear fidgety and will often try to disguise the random movements by voluntarily turning the involuntary, <b>abnormal</b> <b>movement</b> into a seemingly more normal, purposeful motion. Chorea may result specifically from disorders of the basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum. It has also been associated with encephalitis, hyperthyroidism, anticholinergic toxicity, and other genetic and metabolic disorders. Chorea is also the prominent movement featured in Huntington's disease.|$|E

2500|$|Signs of {{vestibular}} disease include head tilt, circling, nystagmus (an <b>abnormal</b> <b>movement</b> of the eyes), {{and difficulty}} or inability to stand. These clinical signs {{are similar to}} those seen in humans experiencing vertigo. [...] Vestibular disease may have many causes. Elderly dogs are susceptible to an idiopathic (meaning due to unknown causes) form of vestibular disease commonly called [...] "old dog vestibular disease" [...] or idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease. The signs may improve rapidly or take a few days. Less commonly, vestibular signs can also be caused by inner ear disease, a brain tumor, a stroke, or other causes. The major risk with idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease is that the dog is often unable to eat, drink, or go outside to urinate or defecate. [...] These cases must receive supportive therapy of intravenous fluids and nutrition; a light sedative is sometimes administered, as the dog may be very stressed by the experience.|$|E
2500|$|Nutcracker {{esophagus}} {{is characterized}} as a motility disorder of the esophagus, meaning that it is caused by <b>abnormal</b> <b>movement,</b> or peristalsis of the esophagus. Patients with motility disorders present with two key symptoms: either with chest pain (typically reported as non-cardiac chest pain as it is esophageal in origin), which is usually found in disorders of spasm, or with dysphagia (difficulty with swallowing). Nutcracker esophagus can present with either of these, but chest pain is the more common presentation. The chest pain is very severe and intense, and mimics cardiac chest pain. It may spread into the arm and back. The symptoms of nutcracker esophagus are intermittent, and may occur with or without food. [...] Rarely, patients can present with a sudden obstruction of the esophagus after eating food (termed a food bolus obstruction, or the 'steakhouse syndrome') requiring urgent treatment. The disorder does not progress to produce worsening symptoms or complications, unlike other motility disorders (such as achalasia) or anatomical abnormalities of the esophagus (such as peptic strictures or esophageal cancer). Many patients with nutcracker esophagus {{do not have any}} symptoms at all, as esophageal manometry studies done on patients without symptoms may show the same motility findings as nutcracker esophagus. Nutcracker esophagus may also be associated with the metabolic syndrome, The incidence of nutcracker esophagus in all patients is uncertain.|$|E

5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific <b>abnormal</b> <b>movements,</b> {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. <b>Abnormal</b> <b>movements,</b> for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful <b>abnormal</b> <b>movements</b> such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|R

50|$|The {{specific}} and familial association of BIFE and PKC defines a novel clinical entity : the infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis syndrome. The first observation {{was made in}} four families where children were affected with nonfebrile convulsions at age 3-12 months.Partial epileptic seizures started with a psychomotor arrest and a deviation {{of the head and}} eyes to one side, followed inconstantly by unilateral jerks.In some cases, seizures generalized secondarily. None of the interictal electroencephalograms showed epileptiform abnormalities, and magnetic-resonance imaging were normal. These convulsions had a favorable outcome. At 5-8 years of age affected children developed <b>abnormal</b> <b>movements.</b> They presented with twisting movements of the hands of a reptilian type when stressed or embarrassed. They also developed jerky movements of the legs after running. Initially, <b>abnormal</b> <b>movements</b> were intermediate in speed between quick and slow, typical of paroxysmal choreoathetosis. Combinations of <b>abnormal</b> <b>movements</b> involving the arms, legs, trunk and occasionally the head were observed. The attacks lasted only a few minutes, occurring with a frequency of 5-30 episodes per day and were not accompanied by unconsciousness. In all patients, <b>abnormal</b> <b>movements</b> disappeared at 25-30 years of age without any treatment. Since the first report similar clinical presentations have been published which confirm the specificity of the ICCA syndrome.|$|R
