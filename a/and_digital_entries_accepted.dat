50|$|The Epica {{results are}} {{determined}} by category. The highest scoring entry in each category wins gold, on condition that the work surpasses a minimum score that qualifies it as a category winner. Other entries in each category that achieve this score win silver or bronze. When no entry meets the standard there are no winners in the category. Four Grand Prix are awarded to the best overall film, press, outdoor <b>and</b> <b>digital</b> <b>entries.</b> These are selected from all the category winners.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this entry is to provide an {{overview}} of information science as a field or discipline, including a historical perspective to illustrate the events and forces that shaped it. Information science is a field of professional practice and scientific inquiry dealing with effective communication of information and information objects, particularly knowledge records, among humans in the context of social, organizational, and individual need for and use of information. Information science emerged {{in the aftermath of the}} Second World War, as did a number of other fields, addressing the problem of information explosion and using technology as a solution. Presently, information science deals with the same problems in the Web <b>and</b> <b>digital</b> environments. This <b>entry</b> covers problems addressed by information science, the intellectual structure of the field, and the description of main areas—information retrieval, human information behavior, metric studies, <b>and</b> <b>digital</b> libraries. This <b>entry</b> also includes an account of education related to information science and conclusions about major characteristics...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDigital {{curation}} is {{the global}} concept that includes {{all aspects of}} work on digitized <b>and</b> born <b>digital</b> cultural objects: from document entry to data description or indexing, storage, dissemination, and long-term preservation. It is an expanding activity, whose rules and best practices are not globally defined yet. The BnF has chosen to rely on observations {{on the ground to}} understand how its staff, faced with the urgent need to collect and preserve a fast-growing digital heritage, is developing new tasks and skills. A dedicated group called ORHION, a French acronym for Observatory of Organizations and Human Resources under Digital Influence, has launched a series of studies on professional identities that are particularly affected by the increasing shift to digital activities. It has so far completed its analysis of two subjects: metadata curation <b>and</b> <b>digital</b> <b>entries.</b> In order to assess the BnF's practices, ORHION also relies on other institutions' experiences. It has for instance organized a workshop on web archive curation during this year's general assembly of the International Internet Preservation Consortium, in May 2014. This paper focuses on the findings of these three use case analyses: the switch from cataloguing to metadata management for description and access; the processes and agents involved in <b>digital</b> entries; <b>and</b> the organization, skills and training of web curating teams. Based on these three experiences, this paper seeks to identify some key trends in digital curation: the notion of digital collection itself is not obvious and needs to be rethought; professional identities are challenged by the apparition of new tasks and the emergence of new actors; stakeholders struggle to understand their own roles and responsibilities in more complex treatment channels. Training staff and sharing the workload between the first pioneers {{and the rest of the}} teams are necessary to involve all professionals in digital curation...|$|R

40|$|Many {{argue that}} {{monitoring}} conducted exclusively by scientists {{is insufficient to}} address ongoing environmental challenges. One solution entails the use of mobile digital devices in participatory monitoring (PM) programs. But how <b>digital</b> data <b>entry</b> affects programs with varying levels of stakeholder participation, from nonscientists collecting field data to nonscientists administering every step of a monitoring program, remains unclear. We reviewed the successes, in terms of management interventions and sustainability, of 107 monitoring programs described in the literature (hereafter programs) and compared these with case studies from our PM experiences in Australia, Canada, Ethiopia, Ghana, Greenland, and Vietnam (hereafter cases). Our literature review showed that participatory programs {{were less likely to}} use <b>digital</b> devices, <b>and</b> 2 of our 3 more participatory cases were also slow to adopt <b>digital</b> data <b>entry.</b> Programs that were participatory <b>and</b> used <b>digital</b> devices {{were more likely to report}} management actions, which was consistent with cases in Ethiopia, Greenland, and Australia. Programs engaging volunteers were more frequently reported as ongoing, but those involving <b>digital</b> data <b>entry</b> were less often sustained when data collectors were volunteers. For the Vietnamese and Canadian cases, sustainability was undermined by a mismatch in stakeholder objectives. In the Ghanaian case, complex field protocols diminished monitoring sustainability. Innovative technologies attract interest, but the foundation of effective participatory adaptive monitoring depends more on collaboratively defined questions, objectives, conceptual models, and monitoring approaches. When this foundation is built through effective partnerships, <b>digital</b> data <b>entry</b> can enable the collection of more data of higher quality. Without this foundation, or when implemented ineffectively or unnecessarily, <b>digital</b> data <b>entry</b> can be an additional expense that distracts from core monitoring objectives and undermines project sustainability. The appropriate role of <b>digital</b> data <b>entry</b> in PM likely depends more on the context in which it is used and less on the technology itself. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{symposium}} considers how {{the digital}} humanities (DH), which relies on computer technology to interpret data and present conclusions, can enhance {{our understanding of}} tourism history. It begins with an introduction that defines DH, considers how DH can assist {{the way in which}} we think about tourism, and discusses the strengths and limitations of applications like text mining <b>and</b> <b>digital</b> mapping. This is followed by a review of the scholarship on <b>digital</b> mapping <b>and</b> the humanities which also highlights some of the important themes and projects that have sprung from this dynamic interdisciplinary dialogue. The latter half of the symposium is dedicated to two project reports. The first describes how the Grand Tour Project at Stanford University is utilizing a database of <b>digital</b> <b>entries</b> which combine digitised text and structured data to illuminate connections between eighteenth-century travellers. The second discusses how the Geospatial Innovation in the Digital Humanities project at Lancaster University is using geo-spatial technologies to examine the relationship between historically evolving ideas about tourist destinations in the Lake District and the contemporary management of such sites. The symposium concludes with some contemplation of the future developments in the realm of <b>digital</b> humanities <b>and</b> tourism history...|$|R
