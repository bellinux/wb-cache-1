25|$|Chewing gum {{is used as}} <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> <b>approach</b> for the {{treatment}} of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). One hypothesis is that chewing gum stimulates the production of more bicarbonate-containing saliva and increases the rate of swallowing. After the saliva is swallowed, it neutralizes acid in the esophagus. In effect, chewing gum exaggerates one of the normal processes that neutralize acid in the esophagus. However, chewing gum is sometimes considered to {{contribute to the development of}} stomach ulcers. It stimulates the stomach to secrete acid and the pancreas to produce digestive enzymes that aren't required. In some cases, when consuming large quantities of gum containing sorbitol, gas and/or diarrhea may occur.|$|E
25|$|Small {{molecule}} antiandrogens {{that are}} available today have undesirable side effects caused by complete, non-selective inhibition of AR action. To minimize these side effects, {{a new class of}} tissue selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) has been proposed as <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> <b>approach</b> for the treatment of prostate cancer. These ligands should behave as antagonists in the prostate with either no activity or agonist activity in other target tissues, so as to have little or no effects in the anabolic tissues or central nervous system (CNS). However discovering this new class of ligands might be challenging because the molecular mechanism of AR action is not well understood.|$|E

This work sets up <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> synthesis <b>approach</b> in which CNTs are anchored to the mpPDMS surface (and not embedded into the PDMS), thus significantly increasing the mpPDMS/CNT composite material effective surface and, in turn, considerably improving sensing performance when used for strain/stress applications...|$|R

The works of Hellenistic-influenced Islamic philosophers were crucial in the reception of Aristotelian logic in medieval Europe, along with the commentaries on the Organon by Averroes.
