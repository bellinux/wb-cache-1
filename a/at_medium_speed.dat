The Mark 5 had variable speed; at a high speed of 40 knots, it had a range of 1000 yards. A low speed of 27 knots allowed the weapon a range of 4000 yards; <b>at</b> <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> of 36 knots, its range was 2000 yards.

5000|$|The {{third day}} {{starts in the}} moorlands and moves into alpine desert, with fewer trees and more rocks. The highest point is {{the base of the}} Lava Tower, after which the trail descends into the Barranco Valley. More {{vegetation}} is present in this zone, especially the area just before the campsite. This area is called the [...] "Garden of the Senecios", which features many of the huge senecio plants. Shorter lobelia plants are also present. [...] The fourth day starts with the ascent of the Barranco Wall, which is considered a scramble in climbing terms. The trail continues with many up and down sections across small streams and rivulets and finally crosses the Karanga River to the Karanga campsite. The fifth day follows the path up and across a rocky zone, finishing at the high camp Barafu. Very little vegetation {{can be found on the}} inhospitable terrain. A field of sedimentary rocks litters the ground. (Note - the six-day trek omits the Karanga campsite, and trekkers continue directly to Barafu on the same day.) The summit is usually attempted on the very early morning of the sixth day (around midnight). Barafu is also used as a summit campsite for the Umbwe route. Trekkers typically take somewhere between five and seven hours to ascend, using headlamps and cold weather gear. Making the ascent on a full moon or shortly thereafter can make the headtorch unnecessary. The first milestone, generally reached shortly after dawn, is Stella Point (18652 ft), which is on the crater rim. Following Stella Point, the trail continues for another 60 minutes to Uhuru Peak, the summit. The descent back to Barafu takes roughly four hours. Some trekkers scree slide down the slope, which entails skidding/running down the loose gravel <b>at</b> <b>medium</b> <b>speed.</b> From Barafu, trekkers typically take a short break, and continue downwards through the alpine desert and ensuing moorlands to Mweka Camp. The seventh and final day has trekkers continue through the montane forest to Mweka Gate. Troops of black-and-white colobus monkeys can often be seen in the dense growth.

50|$|Efficiency of {{automotive}} alternators {{is limited by}} fan cooling loss, bearing loss, iron loss, copper loss, and the voltage drop in the diode bridges.

Pellegrino et al., for instance, propose not particularly expensive designs that show ample regions in which efficiency is above 96%.

40|$|Thermal Engine Encapsulation (TEE) is a {{technique}} for reducing heat loss from an engine {{after it has been}} switched off, {{in order to get a}} warmer re-start. This practice yields benefits in terms of fuel economy, emissions and wear, especially for vehicles used for short journeys in cold weathers and with engines warming up slowly. In this study, the encapsulation of a small automotive Diesel engine is investigated by means of theoretical and experimental analyses. In particular, the influence of oil temperature on brake specific fuel consumption and emissions is calculated. Furthermore, the thermal behavior of the engine has been simulated by a lumped-capacitance model, in order to assess the correlation between encapsulation thickness and cool-down time. Finally, the 0 -D thermal model and the 1 -D engine model have been coupled in order to predict the influence of engine cranking temperature on fuel consumption and pollutant emissions, considering a B-class vehicle running a short journey (15 minutes) <b>at</b> <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> and load and very low external temperature (0 °C) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{portable}} device for assessing rail bending and torsion {{as well as}} the relative wheel-rail position was designed and tested. The main requirement for this device is that its first eigenfrequency should be well above the first bending eigenfrequency of the rail in order not to dynamically amplify rail bending motions. Thus, a minimum target frequency of 100 Hz is set. Another requirement is to design a device that could be easily mounted on different track sections in order to assess also the influence of vehicle type and speed. Thus, a {{portable device}} based on laser sensors was produced that does not require any operations on the rails (contactless sensors) and allows to place the sensors at a reasonable distance from both the rail and the passing by wheel.

The model of dynamic noncooperative game between the drivers and crossing pedestrians was established. In addition, the equilibrium solutions of the model were analyzed as well.

Carbonyls and BTEX were analyzed by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) with UV detector and GC/MS (Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy), respectively. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were the predominant components of the carbonyls for E- 0 and E- 10, respectively. During transient mode, formaldehyde, acrolein + acetone, and tolualdehyde pollutants were decreased but, acetaldehyde emissions increased with E- 10 as compared to E- 0. The BTEX emissions were also decreased with E- 10, relative to E- 0.

40|$|Modern VVA systems {{offer new}} {{potentialities}} in improving fuel consumption for spark-ignition engines at low and medium load, meanwhile they grant a higher volumetric efficiency and performance at high load. Recently introduced systems enhance this concept through {{the possibility of}} modifying the intake valve opening, closing and lift, leading {{to the development of}} almost ‘throttle-less’ engines. However, at low loads, the absence of throttling, while improving the fuel consumption, also produces an increased gas-dynamic noise at the intake mouth. Wave propagation inside the intake system is in fact no longer absorbed by the throttle valve and directly impact the radiated noise. In the paper, 1 D and 3 D simulations of the gas-dynamic noise radiated by a production VVA engine are performed at full load and in two part-load conditions. Both models are firstly validated at full load, through comparisons with experimental data. Different settings of the VVA device at part-load are moreover considered to quantify the trade-off existing between fuel consumption and radiated noise reduction. The analyses put into evidence that the optimal control strategy for fuel consumption improvement does not allow a satisfactory abatement of the radiated noise, as well. Presented results show that, at low engine speed, the VVA setting realizing the lowest fuel consumption also produces an acceptable overall noise level. On the contrary, a small fuel consumption penalty must be paid <b>at</b> <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> to realize a sufficiently low radiated noise. The proposed 1 D- 3 D procedure hence constitutes a very useful tool to realize a fully-numerical pre-calibration of the engine under development...|$|E

No rheological properties (characterized by steady and dynamic shear) showed any direct relation to the film thickness of the studied greases. AFM measurements of the thickener microstructure, from which the dimensional properties of the thickener particles (fibers/platelets/spheres) were estimated, showed that the relative increase in the film thickness due to entrainment of the thickener was proportional to the ratio of thickener volume fraction {{to the size of the}} fibers/platelets/spheres. Hence, with the same concentration, smaller thickener particles lead to the generation of thicker films than larger thickener particles. Next, this relation was used to establish the percentage of the thickener particles passing through the contact.
