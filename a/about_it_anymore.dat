50|$|There {{had been}} some {{confusion}} during the 19th and early 20th century in identifying the original location of ancient Myonia, mainly due to Pausanias' description of {{the location of the}} ancient town. Nevertheless, several historians and specialists on the geography of ancient Greece have identified Myonia with the modern village of Agia Efthymia, so there is no doubt <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>anymore.</b> Louis Robert, in his work Études épigraphiques et philologiques, places Myonia at Agia Efthymia, as well as The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites, Alfred Philippson, and the editors of Inscriptiones Graecae, Günther Klaffenbach and Johannes Kirchner. William Martin Leake arrives at the same conclusion and locates Myonia at Agia Efthymia on the road from Salona to Galaxidi, contradicting William Smith, who locates it on the road from Amfissa to Gravia in the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography.|$|E

Smith in recalling the Talladega race he lost in 2008 said he was not worried <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>anymore,</b> and said the Darlington win meant more to him than what he would have {{experienced}} at Talladega.

5000|$|According to drummer Andrew Cook:"I was a cook at a {{place called}} McCarthy's Pub in Massachusetts. A bunch of police cars and {{ambulances}} went screaming by and the name popped in my head. Like, thinking about how people never really think what's 'on the receiving end of sirens,' because its such a common thing just to hear the sirens. Especially {{if you live in a}} city, it just becomes this commonplace thing, nobody thinks twice <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>anymore.</b> Even though there's so much awful stuff going on in the world, and horrible things that happen to people, it's kind of like 'out of sight, out of mind.' It's just kind of a sad thing. So it's kind of a commentary on that. It also works on a couple levels. It can be taken as the Greek mythology example with the Sirens that lure sailors in with their singing, so being on the receiving end of those sirens isn't a great thing. It works both ways." ...|$|E

[...] "We realized more than ever what a big melting pot of all different types of music the '60s were. Take an old Rascals song for example - there's everything from marching band beats to soul music to country sounds in one song. Learning those opened the band's vision to try new things on my songs. It wasn't let's go back and try to make this part fit into my song, but I wanted to capture the same feeling - the way those songs used to make you feel. After a while, we didn't even have to talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>anymore.</b> If you listen to the lead Larry Crane plays on 'Face of the Nation,' he never would have played that 'cause he didn't really know who the Animals were. He's young, and he grew up on Grand Funk Railroad. You hear it, and it's like 'where did that come from?' It had to be from hearing those old records." ...|$|E

40|$|Although karma {{remains a}} key concept in modern Japanese religiosity, {{we can see}} a {{substantial}} amount of reinterpretation of its content, on the level of both official doctrine and individual belief. In classical expressions of karma theory, the idea of ethical retribution extending across multiple life times plays a central role. Previous research, however, has shown that the fatalism often associated with such a concept is alleviated by the incorpo ration of beliefs concerning ancestor veneration, the transfer of merit, astrology, or theistic intervention. This study focuses on the expression of karmic beliefs in the doctrine of two Japanese New Religions and the results of interviews conducted with members of those movements involved in social welfare work, and examines how the concept of karma is reinter preted to allow for modern understandings of freedom and human poten tial. “Karma? Even within the faith people don’t talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> much <b>anymore,</b> or else <b>it</b> is taken in a positive way. ” — A Tenrikyo believer The diversity of karmic belief, in both its classical and contemporary expressions, has been highlighted in a number of recent studies from the historical, anthropological, and philosophical perspectives. 1 While Potter (Neufeldt 1986, p. 109) attempts to delineate a “classical karma theory of India ” as the common core of all postclassical devel opments, recent research has tended to emphasize the elaborations on or reinterpretations of that core, highlighting the variety found in karmic beliefs and their relation to issues such as moral law, justice...|$|R

5000|$|He is a {{firm believer}} in fate and destiny. Jake also {{believes}} in Grob Gob Glob Grod and Glob World. He is also not very willing to do things that require effort sometimes as shown in [...] "The Witch's Garden" [...] when he is unwilling to run and save Finn from Gary. His lack of effort is also shown in Who Would Win when he states that he would rather play Kompy's Kastle than train. Jake's firm belief in determinism is underpinned, or at least is indicative, of a possible commitment to the philosophical creed of stoicism. In the episode [...] "Puhoy" [...] Jake consoles Finn's love induced melancholy by suggesting he 'focus on what's real' as opposed to [...] "getting all hung up on imaginary problems." [...] To explain this he throws his favorite cup out the window {{in order to make it}} [...] "not real" [...] so he does not care <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>anymore.</b> This is a direct reference to the third aphorism of stoic philosopher Epictetus' Enchiridion (135AD), which in turn may be the influence on the Enchiridion that was destroyed by the Lich. However, later that episode he fishes the cup out so his belief in determinism is somewhat inconsistent.|$|E

5000|$|At {{approximately}} the same time, A Company and the lead elements of D Company (which had accompanied Alpha Company at the perimeter {{in the vicinity of}} the creek bed) were met by a fierce NVA attack. Covering the critical left flank from being rolled up by the North Vietnamese were two of A Company's machine gun crews positioned 75 yd southwest of the company's main position. Spec.

Lt. Col. Moore later credited the two gun teams with preventing the NVA from rolling up Alpha Company and driving a wedge into the battalion between Alpha and Charlie Companies. Spec. 4 Adams and Pfc. Rivera were severely wounded in the onslaught. After the two were carried to the battalion's collection point at Lt. Col. Moore's command post to await evacuation by air, Spec. 4 Beck, Spec. Ladner, and Pfc. Edward Dougherty (an ammo-bearer) continued their close range suppression of the Vietnamese advance. Spec. 4 Beck later said of the battle: [...] "When Doc Nall was there with me, working on Russell, fear, real fear, hit me. Fear like I had never known before.
