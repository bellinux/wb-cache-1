500|$|Kesha was {{inspired}} to write the song after continual rejection from the protagonist in the song, Stephen, who refused to call the singer. She told MTV [...] "I wrote [...] <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> that I've been stalking since I was, like, 15, but he's a total loser, so I don't want to glorify him in any way, but I'm really excited for the song." [...] In February 2010, {{after the release of}} the song, Stephen attended one of the singer's concerts. Speaking to Total Access on 96.4FM The Wave, the singer recalled the experience saying [...] "he came to see my show at this huge gay bar in New York and it was totally off the chain. He gets up on stage, takes all his clothes off except his underwear and starts making out with a tranny. I was like, 'Wait a minute, have I been barking up the wrong genre of tree?'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mary's Song (Oh My My My)" [...] was {{actually}} inspired by her next-door neighbors' long lasting marriage, being {{the opposite of}} what tabloids fixate on. Swift wrote [...] "Our Song" [...] for her freshman year of high school talent show with no intentions of including it on the album. She claimed she [...] "just knew there was something about it" [...] and chose to include it on Taylor Swift. [...] "I wrote it <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> I was dating, and how we didn't have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one." [...] The song is a narrative and describes a young couple who use the events in their lives in place of a regular song. The banjo-riddled song is placed {{at the end of the}} album due to its closing lyrics, a request to [...] "play it again". [...] "Invisible" [...] is ballad describing loneliness and heartache of going unnoticed. Sean Dooley of About.com writes, the [...] "piano-driven song [...] perfectly captures the awkward teenage angst we all endure—or have endured—at one time or another." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film two stars {{out of four}} and asked about the title character, [...] "Why should I care <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy?</b> He feels no pain and nothing can kill him, so {{therefore}} he's essentially a story device for action sequences." [...] James Berardinelli gave Wolverine {{two and a half}} stars out of four, calling the action scenes competently executed but not memorable, and considering that when dealing with Wolverine's past [...] "there's little creativity evident in the way those blanks are filled in", and that the revelations made Wolverine [...] "less compelling". Comparatively, Bill Gibron of AMC's Filmcritic.com website gave the film a positive [...] "4.0 out of 5 stars," [...] saying that although Hugh Jackman is [...] "capable of carrying even the most mediocre effort, he singlehandedly makes X-Men Origins: Wolverine an excellent start to the summer 2009 season." [...] He predicted [...] "there will be purists who balk at how Hood and his screenwriters mangle and manipulate the mythology;" [...] and further said that [...] "any ending which leaves several characters unexplained and unaccounted for can't really seal the full entertainment deal." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Bergen, {{known for}} {{conducting}} the first television interview with bin Laden in 1997, {{the idea that}} [...] "the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden... a folk myth. There's no evidence of this... Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently... The real story here is the CIA didn't really have a clue <b>about</b> who <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> was until 1996 when {{they set up a}} unit to really start tracking him." ...|$|R
500|$|Producer {{and writer}} Chip Johannessen {{felt that the}} scene in this episode in which a human hair is {{discovered}} with a message inscribed upon it was a [...] "perfect" [...] moment, in that it [...] "told you everything <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> ... but {{you had no idea}} what he was or what he was going to do next ... you know what kind of crazy motherfucker would do that, but where he is or what he's going to do next, who knows". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E
500|$|Kesha {{had been}} working on Animal for seven years prior to its release, and had written over 200 songs for the album. The {{abundance}} of material extended it from its originally planned twelve tracks to fourteen. Kesha felt that the album had an empowering, carefree message for young women. [...] "For girls, I think it's an empowering record, it's funny, it's cheeky," [...] she said. [...] "I think people need to have fun with whatever they're doing—makeup, their clothes, music, live shows—anything you don't need to take too seriously, don't take too seriously." [...] When asked how the album related to her life, Kesha explained that the album was completely autobiographical. [...] "I just write about what I live—literally, [...] I think there's a great pop song in anything and everything, any situation." [...] She cites her songs [...] "Stephen" [...] and [...] "Dinosaur" [...] as examples of this. She explained: [...] "it's <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> I've been stalking since I was 15. I wrote the song when I was 16 with my mom, and I was like, [...] "This song's so dope, I know it is". [...] "Dinosaur" [...] came [...] "about [...] this old guy who was hitting on me, and his toupee was kind of falling off, and I was like, [...] "Oh my God, you're so old, you're prehistoric, you're like a dinosaur. D-I-N-O-S-A-you are a dinosaur." [...] Explaining the reasoning behind the title track being placed {{at the end of the}} album's track list, Kesha said: ...|$|E
500|$|Swift self-penned [...] "Our Song" [...] for {{the talent}} show of her {{freshman}} {{year in high school}} with no intentions of including it on her debut album. She thought to herself that to be appropriate for the talent show, the song she would write needed to be upbeat and relatable to her classmates. [...] "I wrote it <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> I was dating, and how we didn't have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one", she said. The writing process, as with her lead single [...] "Tim McGraw", took place in approximately 20 minutes. Several months after performing it at the talent show, some of her peers approached her to inform her that they enjoyed the song she played at the talent show, singing a few lines. [...] "They'd only heard it once, so I thought, 'There must be something here!'", Swift recalled. When choosing tracks to record for Taylor Swift, Swift [...] "stood by" [...] "Our Song", repeatedly insisting album producers to record it with her. She claimed she [...] "knew there was something about it." [...] She concluded, [...] "I think there's just some sort of magic in the way the track sounds like it's bouncing." [...] Swift said she desired for the song to be placed as the closing track on Taylor Swift due to its last lyrics repeating the phrase [...] "Play it again", which she thought would subliminally request audiences to replay the album. Big Machine Records executives chose [...] "Our Song" [...] to be the third single from Taylor Swift, which Swift was surprised yet glad about.|$|E

5000|$|Scottish actor Emun Elliott was {{originally}} attached {{to play the}} role of Tom, but was replaced with French actor Stanley Weber.

2500|$|Following Congress' {{repeal of}} the military's [...] "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" [...] policy in December 2010, Marshall {{proposed}} a bill to [...] "ban gays from openly serving in the Virginia National Guard because he is worried about service members catching sexually transmitted diseases from gay troops." [...] According to the Washington Post, Marshall justified the legislation by saying: [...] "If I needed a blood transfusion and the guy next to me had committed sodomy 14 {{times in the last}} month, I'd be worried," [...] and [...] "It's a distraction when I'm on the battlefield and have to concentrate on the enemy 600 yards away and I'm worried <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> who's got eyes on me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Basil {{was first}} modeled on Bing Crosby, but the animators {{eventually}} took inspiration from Leslie Howard. Initially, Ratigan {{had been designed}} as thin, weasely, and ratlike. Following the screening of Champagne for Caesar, Glen Keane noted that following the casting of Price, [...] "is expressive voice and attitude inspired us to further redesign the character." [...] Additionally, during one story meeting, Glen Keane decided to base the stature of Ratigan on then-Disney CEO Ron Miller, who was a 6'6" [...] former football player for the Los Angeles Rams. Furthermore, Keane lifted his personality as he was thumbing through these [...] "photographs of people of London in the 1800s, of railroad men, {{and there was this}} one guy smoking a cigar — he had a top hat and there was just something <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> — this Ratigan...this rat sucking the cigar, completely dressed to the hilt, he was sharp and perfect — he's a sewer rat dressed like a king and he lives as a king!" [...] The following supervising animators included Mark Henn for Basil, Hendel Butoy for Dawson, Rob Minkoff for Olivia, Andreas Deja for Queen Moustoria, Ruben Aquino for Mrs. Judson, and Mike Gabriel for Toby and Felicia.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, CSI {{executive}} producer Anthony Zuiker began casting for the then-unnamed Miami based spin-off. First cast was Emily Procter, as Calleigh Duquesne. Regarding {{her decision to}} leave The West Wing and join Miami, Procter stated that [...] "It was like choosing between a boyfriend that {{wants to be with}} you casually or a man that says I love you." [...] She described her character as [...] "a weird girl [...] bright and very nerdy. She wears a lot of boot-cut corduroy pants and turquoise necklaces and looks like a hippie. I just like to pretend I'm Velma in Scooby-Doo." [...] Adam Rodriguez, Rory Cochrane, and Khandi Alexander were cast alongside Procter, completing the supporting ensemble. For the lead, CBS suggested David Caruso. Zuiker, who stated that he had [...] "heard about the NYPD Blue thing," [...] was initially hesitant. Elaborating, Zuiker stated that he [...] "sort of jumped in and said, 'Naw, I don't know <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy.</b> The show's tough enough to get off the ground and I don't want to walk into any problems." [...] CBS president Les Moonves had announced in January that a Miami spin-off was imminent, yet [...] "It wasn't until we sort of, like, at the eleventh hour, really started to look at our options as to who was going to play Horatio, [...] revisited Caruso. And [...] said, 'Yeah, we'll have him come out for dinner, see what he's about.'" [...] Caruso was later cast as Caine. He was the last pilot cast member to be contracted to series.|$|E
5000|$|Meyer's {{original}} {{vision for}} The Son {{was quite different}} from the final novel; it originally featured [...] "six or seven characters”, was [...] "set in the present day", and [...] "was conceived ... as a book about the rise of a family dynasty and America’s relationship with war and violence." [...] After {{two and a half years}} working on this version, Meyer realized that [...] "these characters were talking <b>about</b> <b>this</b> legendary <b>guy,</b> and they were commenting on the American myth, in a way. And finally ... it finally hit me that ... I needed the legendary character McCullough in the book." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song itself {{deals with}} the growing depictions of {{violence}} in the media at the time and the case of Issei Sagawa, with Jagger saying, [...] "Well there was this scandalous, murderous story in France - it was a true story - <b>about</b> <b>this</b> Japanese <b>guy</b> who murdered <b>this</b> girl and it sort of captured the imagination of the French public, and the Japanese. The Russians wanted to make a movie out of it. So that was the first bit and then I started becoming more light-hearted about it, movies and all. ...it came out as a sort of anti-gratuitous cinema of violence. And it's a kind of anti-violent thing." ...|$|R
5000|$|People {{are more}} likely to notice what they expect than things not part of their {{everyday}} experiences, and they may mistake an unfamiliar stimulus for a familiar and more plausible version. For example, to consider a well-known mondegreen in the song [...] "Purple Haze", one {{would be more likely to}} hear Jimi Hendrix singing that he is <b>about</b> to kiss <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> than that he is about to kiss the sky. Similarly, if a lyric uses words or phrases that the listener is unfamiliar with, they may be misheard as using more familiar terms.|$|R

Callum's quite certain that Ally really hasn't got their best interests at heart, and wants to know more." [...] When Ally threw Martha out of her house, Callum asked George to help him find some [...] "dirt" [...] on Ally and they find two letters addressed to a [...] "Dave Burns" [...] - {{who turned out to}} be Ally.

(Or, conversely, when Mr. Morrison will start playing him the way he's written.)" [...] Mandi Bierly for Entertainment Weekly praised Morrison's acting in the episode [...] "Vitamin D", writing: [...] "Matthew Morrison communicates so much with his eyes. There's a softness and a longing in them that I’m always surprised Emma matches." [...] Eric Goldman for IGN enjoyed Morrison's music performances in the episode [...] "Mash-Up", commending: [...] "I have {{to hand it to}} Matthew Morrison for just going for it in these sequences.

500|$|Musical {{performances}} in [...] "Mash-Up" [...] received mixed reviews. Joal Ryan for E!

[...] He enjoyed Michele's [...] "What a Girl Wants", calling her singing [...] "raw and lovely". Entertainment Weekly Michael Slezak criticized the [...] "Bust A Move" [...] performance, writing that Morrison gave a [...] "pale imitation" [...] of the Young M.C. original. He was slightly more positive regarding the [...] "Thong Song" [...] performance, feeling that Morrison had [...] "a slightly less overwrought vocal than Sisqó", and observed that Salling did [...] "more than a serviceable job" [...] on [...] "Sweet Caroline". Fellow Entertainment Weekly writer Dan Snierson called Morrison's performances [...] "pretty impressive", and MTV's Aly Semigran also enjoyed them, writing: [...] "We want more!".

That's the tragic thing about him, the nobility is there, there are certain feminine values that should have led him in the right direction, but his cock takes over. We say that glibly all the time about men - their brains are in their trousers - that's what he needs to defeat and can't.

The song's recording was commenced at Maratone Studios, in Stockholm, Sweden, by Martin and Shellback. While being interviewed by Rolling Stone, Kesha was asked about her writing technique and how her songs come to fruition, which she explained using [...] "Dinosaur" [...] as an example. The singer explained that the song's conception was auto-biographical and that it stemmed from a previous experience she had when an older man had been hitting on her, which she elaborated on: [...] "I just write about what I live — literally, my entire record is totally autobiographical, because I think there's a great pop song in anything and everything, any situation. There's a song called 'Dinosaur' <b>about</b> <b>this</b> old <b>guy</b> who was hitting on me, and his toupee was kind of falling off, and I was like, 'Oh my God, you're so old, you're prehistoric, you're like a dinosaur.
