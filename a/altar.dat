50|$|The {{practice}} of erecting Roman funerary <b>altars</b> {{is linked to}} the tradition of constructing votive <b>altars</b> to honor the gods. Due to the acceptance that <b>altars</b> act as a symbol of reverence, it is believed that funerary <b>altars</b> were used to heroicize the deceased. Funerary <b>altars</b> differed from votive <b>altars</b> that honored the gods, because they were not recipients of blood sacrifices. Grave <b>altars</b> of heroes were connected with ritual sacrifices, but <b>altars</b> of regular Roman citizens were not. This practical difference is determined because Roman funerary <b>altars</b> do not have sacrificial pans or braziers. By having a similar appearance to votive <b>altars,</b> the symbolism of the reverence of a sacrifice was implied, therefore conveying proper respect to the dead. While having different meanings, the two types of <b>altars</b> were similarly constructed, both aboveground and round or rectangular in shape.|$|R

50|$|Funerary <b>altars</b> of more wealthy Roman {{citizens}} were often {{found on the}} interior of more elaborate tombs. <b>Altars</b> erected by the middle class were also set up in or outside of monumental tombs, but also in funerary precincts that lined the roads leading {{out of the city}} of Rome. The <b>altars</b> that were part of tomb complexes were set up on family plots or on building plots bought by spectators, who then sold them to individual owners. Tombs and <b>altars</b> had a close connection in the mind of a Roman, evidenced by the Latin inscriptions where tombs are described as if they were <b>altars.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{interior}} of the church has nineteen stained glass windows, three behind the <b>altar</b> and eight along {{each side of the}} church building.

The remaining twelve windows each depict a single saint, including Ignatius of Loyola, Stanislaus Kostka, and Saint Cecilia. Further ornamentation of the walls includes carvings depicting the fourteen Stations of the Cross as well as twelve triforiums holding paintings illustrating the Lord's Prayer, the Bread of Life Discourse, and praise to Christ and Mary.
