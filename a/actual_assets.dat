This problematic situation was associated to the prioritization and the strategic alignment, since in the portfolio background it was found that: problems were found with projects with medium to high priority that had no resources assigned during one or more quarters, and that there were no efforts executed in the organization related to certain strategic alignments. To solve this problem project portfolio management methodology was generated, to enable the portfolio owners to categorize, evaluate, select, prioritize, communicate and close the initiatives. Within the VPG CR department there are three portfolios related to operational excellence, talent generation and the improvement of the work environment. For this methodology the <b>actual</b> <b>assets</b> that are available were collected and then an analysis of improvements was done.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to find an appropriate analytical method for scheduling the daily driver tasks in the grocery industry. The goal is to maximize driver utilization. A "Bin-packing" approach is employed to solve the problem. A Bin-packing problem concerns packing a list of items into the minimal number of unit capacity bins. In our problem, the drivers correspond to the bins and the daily delivery tasks are equivalent to the items, where we use time units to measure bin capacity. The model is applied to characterize the operation of a grocery company. Several bin-packing algorithms are implemented on two weeks of delivery data, which represent the company's transportation demand. The driver requirements are calculated and compared with their <b>actual</b> <b>assets.</b> Driver requirements are assessed on a per-day basis, considering the volatility in transportation demand {{over the course of}} the week. The performance of a given bin-packing algorithm is measured by how well it maximizes driver utilization and balances the workload among the drivers. The model's solution generated labor savings and proved that better resource allocation is possible by considering the demands of the various dispatching locations and the days of the week. Extension of the current model to capture the time window constraints of the delivery locations is proposed for future further research. by Arzum Akkas. Thesis (M.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{in detail the}} accounting principle of prudence in non-profit organizations and financial institutions. It defines its application in such organizations and based on comparison it evaluates the practical use of the prudence principle and its reflection in the accounting books. The main focus is on differences in applying the prudence principle that result from differences in the purpose activities and methods of asset management in these organizations. The practical application of the prudence principle in accounting consists mainly in the creation and use of provisions and impairments. These methods are defined by the Implementing Regulation to the Accounting Act No. 563 / 1991. The paper also provides tables where the creation and use of impairments and provisions in the above-mentioned organizations is compared with how business companies proceed in creating impairments and provisions. The key legislation standardizing accounting in the Czech Republic is the Accounting Act No. 563 / 1991, as amended, which stipulates the general accounting principles, the so-called accounting philosophy. The accounting is built around the general accounting principles, which are perceived as the pillars of accounting. Even though they are not stipulated in any particular law, they are legally enforceable and their ignorance can be sanctioned. The general accounting principles represent {{a set of rules}} to be observed in keeping the accounting books, preparing the accounting reports and submitting the accounting reports to users.

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} explore the characteristics, organisational culture and current knowledge management (KM) practice in a community enterprise (CE). Prae Pun - a hand weaving CE in the northeast rural area of Thailand - has typical CE characteristics - self-employed and collaborative management, and a home-based production system utilising local resources and knowledge. This research used a qualitative method. Data were collected through narrative inquiry, participant observation and document analysis. The 18 respondents were Prae Pun members, committee members, an advisory committee member and office staff members. The data were analysed through theme analysis. The findings of this research reveal that, although community members would {{not be aware of}} doing so, Prae Pun managed its knowledge through informal educational activities - learning by doing and observation - and work processes concerned with collaboration and informality. The current KM practice of Prae Pun entails three processes: basic skill development, competence building and new knowledge creation through creation, capture, sharing, transferring, verification, utilisation and codification. Significantly for this study, KM of Prae Pun focuses on organisational knowledge creation and indigenous knowledge systems. The current KM of Prae Pun also has four other components. Its knowledge resources come from members, other villagers, other hand weaving groups, support organisations and markets. Most of the knowledge is tacit and indigenous. The operation and management systems determine the knowledge processes and provide supportive and incentive systems. The organisational culture and resources, including funding, social capital and appropriate technologies, also provide supportive and incentive systems. The resources are also the tools that facilitate the knowledge processes. The knowledge assets encompass <b>actual</b> <b>assets</b> - products, cloth designs, techniques, and operation and management systems - and competencies including members' skills and abilities, social capital, and shared values, which are not registered as intellectual properties but are in the forms of organisational memories. The traditional KM practice of Prae Pun can be possibly strengthened by integrating modern KM concepts, including knowledge resources from academic and government agencies, appropriate technologies to facilitate knowledge codification and knowledge transfer, extrinsic reward and incentive systems, and facilitators or consultants to enhance members' communities of practice (CoPs). The findings of this study and the KM model contribute to both CE development and further research on KM in a CE context and indigenous KM...|$|E

There are however numerous {{problems with this}} stock model as certain features do not follow some empirical stylised facts we see from the observation of <b>actual</b> <b>asset</b> prices. In particular, the constant parameter idea behind Geometric Brownian Motion is flawed. It is argued that information flow dictates stock price movements and information is a function macro-economic regimes shifts. As such, we propose an alternative model, {{one in which the}} parameters in the Standard Geometric Brownian Motion change according to an underlying Hidden Markov Process. This new model, termed a Markov-Switching model, is presented in extensive detail. Parameter Estimation methods, Simulation Methods and Option Pricing Theory are explored. Summary algorithms are presented so that this dissertation may be used as a good reference guide for those wishing to apply Markov-Switching Models. The model is tested by fitting the model on South African data and using the discussed option theory to create various implied volatility surfaces.

40|$|Quantitative easing à la ECB has {{produced}} so far {{an impact on}} long-term nominal rates through ex ante channels: signalling channels, term duration channels, and risk premia channels. The term duration channel will also lead to a lengthening of the average maturity of government debts, with possible implications for fiscal policy. The ECB’s determination to buy government bonds in a fragmented market with a low net supply may also produce an ex post impact, during the <b>actual</b> <b>asset</b> purchases, but less on nominal rates and more on financial plumbing, as recent volatility suggests. As the effects of scarce supply in collateral markets are felt, repo rates remain well below zero. Lower supply and limited re-usability of high quality collateral, capped by regulatory requirements, is a constraint on market liquidity and compresses dealers’ balance sheets. By keeping a depressed yield curve and asset prices high, QE may also accelerate the consolidation of both traditional and capital-market based (dealer) bank business models.

The diffusion of Electrical Vehicles (EVs) is foreseen for the next future, in accordance with the European policies regarding environmental sustainability, resulting in another important change for the distribution grids: EVs charging stations will be realized as new connections with their very variable load towards the grid, in function of the demand required by the EVs. New planning and operation criteria are thus required for the electrical grid. This paper describes results of a wide planning study performed on a real active distribution grid of Enel Distribuzione, including different types of charging stations (public and home stations) in different EVs spread scenarios. The study shows how a smart management approach for EVs charging stations, recently proposed in many scientific papers, dispatching them taking into account DG and coordinating them with RES energy production, could ensure the respect of the operation limits of the grids in the <b>actual</b> <b>asset,</b> so deferring or avoiding network reinforcements...|$|R
