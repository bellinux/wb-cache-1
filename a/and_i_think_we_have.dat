There is no evidence of that. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to take what the secretary Condoleezza Rice says at face value. It is something very important, it is done very carefully and she has said we do not authorise, condone torture in any way, shape or form.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rough Guides in 2006, Chris Ingham said Harrison was [...] "rightly annoyed" [...] {{with his}} former record company. Ingham added that, with the [...] "excellent Volume II" [...] (Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989) no longer in print, The Best of George Harrison was {{therefore}} the artist's only available compilation album and [...] "hardly a satisfying one-stop sampler". Reviewing Let It Roll for the music website Popdose, in 2009, Jon Cummings wrote that [...] "the compilation gods have never been kind to [...] " [...] and described the 1976 album as [...] "downright insulting". In her role as compiler of Let It Roll, Harrison's widow Olivia said of The Best of George Harrison: [...] "That album always bothered me... I just thought that is really not fair <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to put something in that place, and that's really what this [...] is." ...|$|E
500|$|Cardiff manager Malky Mackay {{was proud}} of his players despite their defeat: [...] "We wanted to come here and win today but the players have done the club proud, I think today we were playing against a top team <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> got a lot to be proud of." [...] Anthony Gerrard, who missed the decisive penalty took to Twitter to apologise to Cardiff fans stating that the miss would [...] "...haunt {{me for the rest of}} my days!" [...] Despite Gerrard's apology, Cardiff goalkeeper Tom Heaton was adamant that none of the players should take the blame for the defeat: [...] "There is {{definitely}} no blame attached to any of the lads who missed. They all had the strength of character to stand up and take a penalty in front of 90,000 people and the world watching in a pressure situation. They should be credited and congratulated for taking them. Sadly, it wasn’t our day.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, Pelosi said: [...] "For years, I {{have opposed}} the embargo on Cuba. I don't think it's been successful, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{to remove the}} travel bans and have more exchanges -- people to people exchanges with Cuba." [...] In 2015, Pelosi {{supported}} President Obama's Cuban Thaw, a rapprochement between the U.S. and Cuba, and visited Havana for meetings with high-level officials.|$|E
2500|$|In a January 2007 {{interview}} with the Financial Times, Calderón said, [...] "We have received very encouraging results. In the state of Michoacán, for example, the murder rate has fallen almost 40 percent compared with the average {{over the last six}} months. People's support in the regions where we are operating has grown, and that has been very important. Opinion polls have confirmed that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> made it clear to everyone that this issue is a priority for us".|$|E
2500|$|On 5 December 2003, Jim Kreindler {{revealed}} that his Park Avenue law firm would receive an initial contingency fee of around US$1million {{from each of}} the 128 American families Kreindler represents. The firm's fees could exceed US$300million eventually. Kreindler argued that the fees were justified, since [...] "Over the past seven years we have had a dedicated team working tirelessly on this and we deserve the contingency fee we have worked so hard for, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> provided the relatives with value for money." ...|$|E

2500|$|One justice asked Pritzker about Oliver Wendell Holmes's {{observation}} in Nash v. United States that [...] "the law {{is full of}} instances where a man's fate depends on his estimating rightly, that is, as the jury subsequently estimates it, some matter of degree." [...] He allowed that there was [...] "some looseness" [...] but said the ordinance was still vague, allowing too much room for personal taste to color judgement: [...] "Is a blue pipe inherently criminal, and a brown pipe lawful because in the officer's experience brown is customary and usual? We are essentially talking about taste, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been unfairly characterized with regards to what lifestyle means. Lifestyle did not refer to drug culture." ...|$|E
2500|$|Karl Denninger, former CEO {{and one of}} the {{original}} co-founders of the Tea Party movement, expressed support for the movement, saying [...] "The problem with protests and the political process is that it is very easy, no matter how big the protest is, for the politicians to simply wait until the people go home, and then they can ignore you. Well, Occupy Wall Street was a little different, and back in 2008, I wrote that when we will actually see change is when the people come, they set up camp, and they refuse to go home. That appears to be happening now." [...] Jeff Immelt, CEO of General Electric and a member of Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, stated [...] "It is natural to assume that people are angry, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to be empathetic and understand that people are not feeling great." [...] Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, stated in an interview with Charlie Rose, [...] "I think the number one problem is that we're not having a quality dialogue...I certainly understand the frustration, I understand the dilemma, I understand the discontent." [...] Other business leaders lending their support include George Soros and Russell Simmons.|$|E
2500|$|Political historians still {{debate whether}} Kennedy {{could have won}} the Democratic {{nomination}} had he lived. Some historians, such as Theodore H. White and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., have argued that Kennedy's broad appeal and famed charisma would have convinced the party bosses at the Democratic Convention {{to give him the}} nomination. Jack Newfield, author of RFK: A Memoir, stated in a 1998 interview that on the night he was assassinated, [...] " [...] had a phone conversation with Mayor Daley of Chicago, and Mayor Daley all but promised to throw the Illinois delegates to Bobby at the convention in August 1968. I think he said to me, and Pete Hamill, 'Daley is the ball game, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> Daley. However, other writers such as Tom Wicker, who covered the Kennedy campaign for The New York Times, believe that Humphrey's large lead in delegate votes from non-primary states, combined with Senator McCarthy's refusal to quit the race, would have prevented Kennedy from ever winning a majority at the Democratic Convention, and that Humphrey would have been the Democratic nominee even if Kennedy had lived. The journalist Richard Reeves and historian Michael Beschloss have both written that Humphrey was the likely nominee, and future Democratic National Committee chairman Larry O'Brien wrote in his memoirs that Kennedy's chances of winning the nomination had been slim, even after his win in California.|$|E

"Tell him," [...] said Miss Vernon, [...] "we {{shall be}} happy to see him if he will step this way--place another {{wineglass}} and chair, and leave the room.-- You must retire with him when he goes away," [...] she continued, addressing herself to me; [...] "even my liberality cannot spare a gentleman above eight hours out of the twenty-four; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been together for at least that length of time." ...|$|E

6000|$|Freedom: {{what do we}} want freedom for? For this, at least; that we may be {{each and}} all able to think what we choose; and to say what we choose also, {{provided}} we do not say it rudely or violently, so as to provoke a breach of the peace. That last was Mr. Buckle's definition of freedom of speech. That was the only limit to it which he would allow; and I think that that is Mr. John Stuart Mill's limit also. [...] It is mine. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> that kind of freedom in these islands as perfectly as any men are likely to have it on this earth.|$|E

"You say truth," [...] cried Ole, {{springing}} up and pacing the deck with unwonted energy, while a troubled and somewhat fierce expression settled on his usually good-humoured countenance.

[...] "It is even more serious to me," [...] she resumed, [...] "for private reasons--than it is to my sister. I know nothing yet but that our father's brother has taken our fortunes from us. He must have some motives of his own for such conduct as that. It is not fair to him, or fair to us, to keep those motives concealed. He has deliberately robbed Norah, and robbed me; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a right, if we wish it, to know why?" ...|$|E
