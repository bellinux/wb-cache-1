40|$|In {{permanent}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) systems, pulsed gradient fields induce strong eddy currents in the conducting structures of the magnet. The gradient field for image encoding is perturbed by these eddy currents, thus leading to MR image distortions. The conventional approach for {{the reduction of the}} eddy current effects is to employ passive shielding (an eddy current board). However, the analysis of the passive shielding structure is typically nonoptimal. In this article, a comprehensive 3 D finite element method (FEM) model for the characterization of eddy currents in the ferromagnetic materials of the magnet is developed, which is helpful for the evaluation of the shielding effects and the improvement of passive shielding designs. During the numerical analyses, the eddy current source was introduced through X-gradient coils, nonlinearity, and the <b>anisotropy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>laminated</b> silicon steel structure was considered, with the selection of a penalty factor in the FEM governing equations being also detailed.

40|$|Composite {{laminates}} {{have been}} increasingly used in advanced structural applications, {{due to their}} excellent strength-to-weight properties and considerable flexibility on designing {{with respect to the}} laminate layup. However, the heterogeneity and <b>anisotropy</b> <b>of</b> composite <b>laminates</b> have brought many challenges for analysis and numerous researches have been devoted in this field. A well known problem which has been studied intensively is the so-called free-edge problem. It states that due to the mismatch in elastic properties of adjacent layers, full-scale three-dimensional (3 D) and highly concentrated stress fields will occur {{in the vicinity of the}} free edges. The interlaminar stresses grow very rapidly at the layer interface over a small boundary region and decay quickly toward the inner laminate region at the free edges. As the transverse normal and shear strength of interfaces are usually very low, these interlaminar stresses may cause initiation of delamination. Therefore, it is important to obtain the accurate 3 D stress field of the free-edge problem. ^ In the present study, free-edge stress analysis <b>of</b> composite <b>laminated</b> structures with arbitrary cross sections is dealt with mechanics of structure genome (MSG). MSG is a unified theory that links the original heterogeneous structures with microscopic details and the hypothetical homogeneous continuum used in the macroscopic structural analysis. A cross-sectional analysis specialized from MSG is formulated to solve the free-edge problem <b>of</b> composite <b>laminates</b> with arbitrary cross sections. In contrast to the existing methods, MSG cross-sectional analysis is applicable to <b>laminates</b> <b>of</b> general layups under general loads. In this thesis, MSG based free-edge stress analysis has been further explored to analyze composite laminated structures with arbitrary cross sections and arbitrary layup under general loads. ^ An I-beam laminate and a curved beam laminate subjected to extension, bending and twisting are analyzed separately by MSG to study the distributions of interlaminar stresses. The results successfully capture the stress singularity at the free edge and are in excellent agreement with 3 D finite element analysis (FEA) results. Moreover, MSG shows significant advantages in efficiency while accuracy is maintained by comparing to 3 D FEA results. ...|$|R

Permeability <b>anisotropy</b> <b>of</b> a single structureless'-appearing sample is low, reflected by a kV / kH-ratio of 0. 7; corresponding k-distributions are homogeneous.

For the most reliable criteria, based on failure functions having {{the form of a}} general tensorial polynomial, the modes of failure of anisotropic (orthotropic, transversely isotropic) bodies were studied primarily on the principal stress (sigma- 1, sigma- 2, sigma- 3) -subspace.

The effects <b>of</b> <b>anisotropy</b> in <b>laminates</b> lay up have been investigated, as well as the influence of cir-cular hole notches, for both the case of tensile and compressive loading conditions. Due to the high slenderness of specimens, that have the ASTM D 3039 standard suggested geome-try, a special gripping device has been designed {{in order to avoid the}} axial buckling.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{investigation of}} the evolution of damage and the residual stresses in Ti 6 Al 4 V-Al 3 Ti metal-intermetallic laminate (MIL) composites were carried out. Crack morphology and density of as-processed MIL composites were quantified, and quasi-static and dynamic compression tests were conducted on pure Al 3 Ti, as well as on MIL composites, with different volume fractions of Ti 6 Al 4 V (14 %, 20 % and 35 %) under different loading directions (perpendicular and parallel directions to laminate plane), to different strains (̃ 1 %, ̃ 2 %, ̃ 3 %), and at different strain rates (0. 0001 /s and 800 - 2000 /s). Crack densities and distributions were measured, and the differences in crack propagation and damage evolution in MIL composites under quasi-static (0. 0001 /s) and dynamic (800 - 2000 /s) deformation were observed anddiscussed. The fracture stresses under different testing conditions do not exhibit significant strain-rate sensitivity, which is indicative of the dominance of microcracking processes in determining strength. The crack density after dynamic deformation is higher than that after quasi-static deformation. This is attributed to the decreased time for crack interaction in high-strain rate deformation. The effect of crack density, quantified by a damage parameter, on elastic modulus were quantified and the results were compared with experimental results. The principal damage evolution mechanisms were identified. The elastic properties and <b>anisotropy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>laminates</b> were calculated and successfully compared with Resonant Ultrasonic Spectroscopy (RUS) measurements. The residual stress in MIL composites was evaluated from the differences in the thermal expansion coefficients of Ti 6 Al 4 V and Al 3 Ti.

40|$|Free stream tidal {{turbines}} are {{a source}} of growing interest in the marine renewable energy field. Some designs use variable pitch blade control devices in order to maximize the efficiency of the turbines; however these are complex to design, construct and maintain under the severe load conditions sub sea devices experience. There is an interest in the use of composite materials for potential improvements in hydrodynamic and structural performance of Horizontal Axis Tidal Turbines (HATT). In addition to the advantages of high strength-to-mass and high strength to stiffness ratios, <b>anisotropy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>laminated</b> fibre composites can be designed to allow 3 D tailoring of the blade deformation. Anisotropic structures show different levels of elastic coupling, depending on the ply angle in the layers that comprise such a material. Passive control of a turbine blade can be achieved by taking advantage of the directionality of the anisotropic composite material. A structure that undergoes both bending and twisting due to a pure bending load is said to exhibit bend-twist coupling. This type of behaviour has been identified as a potential method for load reduction - particularly fatigue loads, and an increase in both efficiency and annual energy capture in wind turbines [1]. Preliminary studies have since shown that this may also be the case for HATTs [2]. A computationally efficient, yet realistic, model has been developed in order to estimate the amount of induced twist present on a bend-twist coupled blade in a tidal stream. This model takes into account the effect on the induced twist of fibre orientation, blade loading and cross section, material mechanical properties, and shell thickness. The method has been incorporated into a Blade Element Momentum code, modified to predict the performance of free stream tidal devices; such that the performance of a HATT with composite bend-twist coupled blades could be estimated. It has been shown that, when compared to a free stream tidal turbine with fixed blades of a similar configuration, a HATT that utilises composite bend-twist couple blades can reduced fatigue loading, bring the turbine efficiency closer to the Betz limit and increase the annual energy capture...|$|R

Laminated glass is comprised of multiple plates of glass bonded together with polymorphous interlayers. The interest in the use <b>of</b> architectural <b>laminated</b> glass in the construction industry has increased due to its possible advantages over monolithic glass. Some of the advantageous properties <b>of</b> <b>laminated</b> glass include a greater impact resistance, improved sound resistance, and better thermal insulation inside the structure. The most important advantage <b>of</b> <b>laminated</b> glass as compared to monolithic glass is its improved safety. Should failure <b>of</b> <b>laminated</b> glass occur, the interlayer would adhere to the surrounding glass plates. This would prevent the glass from shattering and potentially harming any inhabitants of the structure. Although these advantages are generally accepted, the performance <b>of</b> <b>laminated</b> glass is highly disputed. Of particular interest are the performance <b>of</b> <b>laminated</b> glass at various temperatures and its response to loading over a duration of time. There are two primary objectives of this thesis. First, the effect of temperature on the elastic bending stiffness <b>of</b> <b>laminated</b> glass with a polyvinyl butyral (PVB) based interlayer is to be resolved. The creep response with respect to temperature will also be observed. Second, the design method for laminated glass will be evaluated.
