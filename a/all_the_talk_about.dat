25|$|For the {{remainder}} of Presley's life, Parker would see very little of him. The two had become almost strangers to each other, and false reports in the media suggested that Presley's contract was up for sale. Although Parker publicly denied these claims, {{he had been in}} talks with Peter Grant, manager of Led Zeppelin, about the possibility of him overseeing a European tour for Presley. As with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Presley touring overseas, Parker never followed through with the deal.|$|E

Maybe {{it was that he}} knew he was redundant, so he overcompensated. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the French Situationists being {{associated}} with punk is bollocks. It's nonsense!" [...] Cook concurs: [...] "Situationism {{had nothing to do with}} us. The Jamie Reids and Malcolms were excited because we were the real thing. I suppose we were what they were dreaming of." [...] According to Lydon, [...] "If we had an aim, it was to force our own, working-class opinions into the mainstream, which was unheard of in pop music at the time." ...|$|E

There's going to be one house in this scandal-mongering town to-night that isn't going to spring the holier-than-thou. And throw those filthy evening papers out of the house!" ...|$|R
60|$|We were {{obsessed by}} the books we read, by <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> us {{that once we}} had linked {{ourselves}} we were linked for life.

I don't believe he's bad, for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> him, but he's been weak, and that's a thing she couldn't forgive in a man; she's so strong herself." ...|$|E

[...] "I {{consider}} that for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> kinship, and {{all that sort of}} thing, she treats us--I mean women like myself--disgracefully. But that's neither here nor there. I've finished with England for the present. We're going to play a greater game than that!" ...|$|E

50|$|Dalrymple {{organised}} {{a public}} meeting in Dunedin in November 1865. She felt unable to chair the meeting {{because it was}} not appropriate for an unmarried woman to do so, but persuaded a Mrs Thomas to take that position on the understanding that Dalrymple would do <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking.</b> <b>About</b> thirty women attended, but the meeting was disrupted by a couple of interruptions, and then had to be abandoned because a German band practising outside made speech impossible. The petition was presented to the Provincial Council in early December 1865. It was passed to a Select Committee on Education, which praised it and recommended it be implemented, but no action was taken.|$|R

And, of course, every one respected his feelings, and said nothing to him about it.|$|E
6000|$|... 123. And in {{all great}} times of art, this purpose is as naïvely {{expressed}} {{as it is}} steadily held. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> abstraction belongs to periods of decadence. In living times, people see something living that pleases them; and {{they try to make}} it live for ever, or to make it something as like it as possible, that will last for ever. They paint their statues, and inlay the eyes with jewels, and set real crowns on their heads; they finish, in their pictures, every thread of embroidery, and would fain, if they could, draw every leaf upon the trees. And their only verbal expression of conscious success is, that they have made their work [...] "look real." ...|$|E
60|$|The British public {{now found}} out on what illusions {{they had for}} the last four years been fed. Those of them who had memories, could {{recollect}} how the Irish secretary of the day, on the third reading of the first Coercion bill in 1881, had boldly appealed from the Irish members to the People of Ireland. “He was sure that he could appeal with confidence from gentlemen sitting below the gangway opposite to their constituents.”(165) They remembered <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Parnell and his followers being a mere handful of men and not a political party at all, and the rest of it. They had now a revelation what a fool’s paradise it had been.|$|E

[...] "After <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> you and him which has reached us here, who would have expected it to end like this! Why didn't ye think of doing some good for your family instead o' thinking only of yourself? See how I've got to teave and slave, and your poor weak father with his heart clogged like a dripping-pan. I did hope for something to come out o' this! To see what a pretty pair you and he made that day when you drove away together four months ago! See what he has given us--all, as we thought, because we were his kin. But if he's not, {{it must have been}} done because of his love for 'ee. And yet you've not got him to marry!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Television critic James Poniewozik has {{disagreed}} with this assessment, writing, [...] "for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> 'humiliation TV,' what's striking about most reality shows is how good humored and resilient {{most of the}} participants are: the American Idol rejectees stubbornly convinced of their own talent, the Fear Factor players walking away from vats of insects like Olympic champions. What finally bothers their detractors is, perhaps, not that these people are humiliated but that they are not." ...|$|E

50|$|Hello. My name is Buzz Brockway from Lawrenceville, Georgia. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> {{the war in}} Iraq {{centers around}} how quickly we can get out. I think that's the wrong question. We {{need to make a}} {{permanent}} or long-term military commitment to the region. By staying in Iraq, we provide long-term stability to the region, we provide support for our allies, and we act as a deterrent to the trouble-makers in the region. Which presidential candidate will make a permanent of long-term military commitment to the people of Iraq? Thank you.|$|E

The reporter ostensibly met Ranogajec in person, while the latter was in Mosman, and asked him if he was indeed the world's biggest punter.

Money itself, I suppose,cannot be tainted, but it may at times represent a tainted partnership, and it is not well for the Church to have her tongue tied byany such coalition, because it is her duty to be ready to denounce wickedness in high places as well as in low places.
