5|$|The {{development}} of women's football in Africa faces several challenges, including {{limited access to}} education, poverty amongst women, inequalities and human rights abuses targeting women. Funding is another issue impacting the game in Africa, where most financial assistance comes from FIFA and not national football associations. <b>Another</b> <b>challenge</b> is the retention of football players. Many women footballers leave the continent to seek greater opportunity in Europe or the United States.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{successful}} collaboration on the pitch, {{a strong}} personal rivalry developed between Ramsey and Nicholson, partly because both {{liked the idea}} of staying on at Tottenham in a coaching role after retiring. Rowe made clear to Ramsey that he wanted him to do so, but unfortunately for him Rowe stepped down in February 1955, citing health issues. <b>Another</b> <b>challenge</b> to Ramsey's position at Tottenham {{came in the form of}} Danny Blanchflower, a Northern Ireland international wing-half signed from Aston Villa to replace Nicholson. Blanchflower was a more attacking player than Nicholson and thus did not provide the necessary cover for Ramsey to advance upfield; Ramsey also resented the idea that Blanchflower might supplant him as Tottenham's main strategist.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the filming}} was completed, more than 20 two-hour Beta SP video tapes of footage {{had to be}} edited down to fit {{the actions of the}} game. The {{programming}} included editing the original video footage, and mixing the rendered images of doors, drawers, chairs and other objects into the footage frame-by-frame, which was necessary for more than 100 scenes. The game required more polishing and fine-tuning than most games of its time due to the many video components, and the programmers had to determine the desired frame rate, data transfer rate and desired resolution of the video elements. <b>Another</b> <b>challenge</b> for the game was CD resource management. Since many of the scenes in the game could be repeated in multiple chapters, some pieces of the code were written onto several different CDs {{to reduce the number of}} times the player had to swap discs in the middle of a chapter, an unusual practice for computer games at the time. The final game was on seven discs, a large number for a computer game, and more than the four or five discs originally expected.|$|E
50|$|His <b>another</b> <b>challenging</b> project, as an {{independent}} Director was directing a film with Dr. Shivarajkumar titled “Cheluveye Ninne Nodalu.|$|R
50|$|Time {{constraints}} were <b>another</b> <b>challenging</b> {{aspect of}} the project. The architects were given a year to design, document and construct this building.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>challenging</b> {{thematic}} innovation of {{the show}} was the blending and balancing of current popular music, classic session and performance music from the BBC archives, and new music.|$|R
5|$|At {{the onset}} of war in Korea, No.77 Squadron was self-supporting, the largest flying unit in the RAAF. It {{comprised}} 299 officers and men, 40 Mustangs, 3 CAC Wirraways, 2 Douglas C-47 Dakotas and 2 Austers. The added burden of combat operations made this situation untenable after the squadron went into action in Korea, leading {{to the formation of}} No.391 (Base) Squadron at Iwakuni, {{at the same time as}} No.91 Wing headquarters. RAAF base squadrons were responsible for administrative, logistical, medical, communications and security functions. Staffed mainly by former No.77 Squadron members, in the first year of its existence No.391 Squadron had to try to overcome severe shortages of winter clothing and equipment. Further problems arose when No.77 Squadron converted to Gloster Meteors between April and July 1951, as spares for the British-made jet were harder to obtain than for the American Mustang. No longer could No.391 Squadron source parts from the US Fifth Air Force as it had up till this point. Disposal of the Mustangs and their spares also caused headaches; the process took two years, causing storage issues. The base squadron faced <b>another</b> <b>challenge</b> in January 1952, following a controversial change in role for the Meteors, from air-to-air combat to ground attack, which necessitated obtaining supplies of rockets and modification of the aircraft to carry them.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} weeks, vignettes aired where he berated {{members of his}} own family, eventually being confronted by José Huertas González. On October 7, 2012, Savio Vega reappeared in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre, issuing yet <b>another</b> <b>challenge.</b> However, this time Colón fired back with a challenge of his own, inviting Vega to a special edition of Carlito's Cabana. The edition of Carlito's Cabana that featured Vega took place on October 14, 2012. In the segment, both traded insults and it finished with the security removing Vega when he tried to assault Colón after the former spat an apple in his face. At Halloween Wrestling Xtravaganza he was disqualified, assaulting his opponent after his father, who served as special referee, did not allow Huertas González to use his finisher. At Honor vs. Traición, Colón unsuccessfully challenged Ray González for the Universal Heavyweight Championship. A Hair vs. Hair rematch was immediately scheduled for Lockout, which will feature a guest referee elected by popular vote between Vega and Huertas González. The following night marked the first time that Colón participated in a match where his father was among his opponents, but he avoided facing him directly, instead requesting a tag and only entering later to pin González.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, aged 20, Ulrich {{ran for a}} Republican District Leader post, {{but lost}} by 124 votes. Two years later, he mounted <b>another</b> <b>challenge</b> and won.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>challenging</b> {{thematic}} innovation of {{the show}} is the blending and balancing of current popular music, classic session and performance music from the BBC archives, and new and possibly heretofore unheard alternative music.|$|R
50|$|Following a very {{successful}} African tour, Gazza embarked upon <b>another</b> <b>challenging</b> task. He teamed up with the Tafel Lager brand, and set out on 11 town nationwide Tour, to {{all corners of the}} country in the months of September and October.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1905 and the {{beginning}} of 1906, when Moscow was burning from riots and shellfire, Grabar tackled <b>another</b> <b>challenging</b> subject, frost, at the same time investing more and more time into writing and editing. Snow, and winter in general, remained his favorite subjects for life.|$|R
25|$|Montreal then {{received}} <b>another</b> <b>challenge</b> {{from the}} MHA's Winnipeg Victorias. This time, {{it was decided}} that they would play a two-game total goals series in February 1899.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>challenge</b> for {{pilots who}} {{are forced to}} fly an {{aircraft}} without functioning control surfaces is to avoid the phugoid instability mode (a cycle in which the aircraft repeatedly climbs and then dives), which requires careful use of the throttle.|$|E
25|$|The MHA's Winnipeg Victorias issued <b>another</b> <b>challenge</b> for the Cup. This time, a best-of-three {{series was}} played against the {{defending}} champion Montreal Shamrocks. Winnipeg won the first game, 4–3, but Montreal prevailed {{in the next two}} games, 3–2 and 5–4.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, the Rough Riders {{completed}} the season, finishing in fourth {{place of the}} Northeast Division. The team had a 7-5-0 record and tallied 21 points on the season. It was <b>another</b> <b>challenging</b> season and the team {{failed to make the}} playoffs {{for the second year in}} a row.|$|R
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: Episode 8 - <b>Another</b> Unconventional <b>Challenge</b> ...|$|R
30|$|Besides {{equipment}} design, {{data interpretation}} is <b>another</b> <b>challenging</b> aspect of rheological determination and slurry characterization. For a rheometer, the flow model is mathematically well-defined, that is, the shear stresses and shear rates can directly be computed. However, for complex geometries {{such as the}} helical blades impeller, flow models are not straightforward.|$|R
25|$|Russian {{military}} presence was <b>another</b> <b>challenge</b> in the region. Russia promised to withdraw its base at the 1999 Istanbul OSCE summit, and the protracted {{process of the}} ensuing negotiations remained {{a source of great}} tension with Georgia until the base was finally withdrawn by 2008.|$|E
25|$|In March, the Shamrocks {{finished}} the 1900 CAHL season in first place, {{and thus the}} league championship, with a 7–1 record and then received <b>another</b> <b>challenge</b> for the Cup. However, the Halifax Crescents of the Halifax City Hockey League (Maritime champions) did not pose {{much of a threat}} as Montreal crushed them, 10–2 and 11–0.|$|E
25|$|In <b>another</b> <b>challenge,</b> Klass claimed lexicographic {{inconsistencies}} {{based on}} the use of Pica typeface in the Cutler/Twining memo and offered $100 to Stanton Friedman for each legitimate example of the use of the same style and size Pica type as used in the memo. Friedman provided 14 examples and was paid $1,000 by Klass.|$|E
40|$|Crop and {{livestock}} {{producers in the}} United States are facing <b>another</b> <b>challenging</b> year. Prices for corn and soybeans have been hovering at or below cost-ofproduction levels {{for more than a}} year, and large global supplies and a strong U. S. dollar have led to weak export demand, hampering price recovery...|$|R
50|$|Conner {{announced}} {{that he could not}} raise sufficient funds for <b>another</b> Cup <b>challenge.</b>|$|R
50|$|Finally, it was yet <b>another</b> League <b>Challenge</b> Cup {{first round}} exit, to Airdrie United.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>challenge</b> is {{the storage}} of this bulk data. Depending on the {{application}} there could be high data acquisition requirements which in turn lead to high storage requirements. Currently the internet is already responsible for 5% of the total energy generated and this consumption will increase significantly when we start utilizing applications with multiple embedded sensors.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} authorities do not {{compensate the}} Zabbaleen for these changes, {{and as a}} result, the takeover of waste collection threatens the socio-economic sustainability of the Zabbaleen community. More recently, the Zabbaleen have faced <b>another</b> <b>challenge</b> when the Egyptian Agricultural Ministry ordered the culling of all pigs in April 2009, in response to national fears over the possible spread of H1N1 influenza.|$|E
25|$|By 1974, <b>another</b> <b>challenge</b> to the state's {{authority}} and legitimacy {{had come from}} the 19th of April Movement (M-19), leading to a new phase in the conflict. The M-19 was a mostly urban guerrilla group, founded in response to an electoral fraud during the final National Front election of Misael Pastrana Borrero (1970–1974) and the forced removal of former president Gustavo Rojas Pinilla.|$|E
30|$|Clothing is <b>another</b> <b>challenging</b> {{factor for}} gait recognition. The {{appearance}} of a person changes when the person wears different types of clothes. Besides, a recent study [30] shows that gait spoofing is possible by imitating the clothing of a person with similar build. These observations imply that the clothing factor yields high intraclass variation and low interclass variation which makes personal identification difficult.|$|R
50|$|Duke {{returned}} home and earned another win {{before heading to}} Madison Square Garden again to defeat the Washington Huskies. The team then rattled off a few more victories before facing <b>another</b> <b>challenging</b> road battle in Philadelphia against the Temple Owls. The game was a back-and-forth affair, but Khalif Wyatt of Temple made two key 3s in leading his team to the five-point victory.|$|R
50|$|As the {{business}} {{started to take}} shape and grow, they were also faced with many challenges; a flood in 1966 in Florence destroyed all the fabrics and the archives and Carla with her team had {{to start all over}} with hard work and determination. Her husband’s death in 1976 was <b>another</b> <b>challenging</b> period in her career as her sons were very young.|$|R
25|$|At the 1964 general election, Hughes-Young faced <b>another</b> <b>challenge</b> from Labour, who had {{selected}} Dr David Kerr; in his election address {{he pointed to}} the fact that Labour had opposed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 and asked how the local housing situation would cope without restrictions on immigration. In line with the national swing, Labour gained the constituency by 2,245 votes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>challenge</b> is {{low cost}} {{recovery}} due to low tariffs and poor economic efficiency, especially {{in urban areas}} (where water revenue does not cover operating costs). An estimated 56 {{percent of the population}} had access to adequate sanitation facilities in 2010. Community-led total sanitation, addressing the problem of open defecation in rural areas, is credited with improving public health since its introduction in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Ottawa {{eventually}} won the 1905 FAHL title by finishing {{in first}} place with a 7–1 record. Then in March, the Rat Portage Thistles issued <b>another</b> <b>challenge</b> to the Ottawas. Although the Thistles crushed Ottawa in the first game, 9–3, Ottawa was without Frank McGee who did not play. However, McGee returned to lead the Ottawas to 4–2 and 5–4 victories {{in the second and}} third games to win the series.|$|E
50|$|Two {{weeks after}} Canada, the 12th and last {{race of the}} 1972 Formula One season was at <b>another</b> <b>challenging</b> North American venue - Watkins Glen in New York State, only 4 hours from New York City and 5 hours from Toronto. Stewart won again ahead of his {{teammate}} Cevert, in a race that had 31 cars and drivers start the race.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>challenging</b> uphill climb is then tackled {{with the}} rise to the Pluviometer which is {{situated}} towards {{the eastern end of}} the Black Range ridge. This is followed by a slightly-inclining walk along the ridgeline to the dedicated Black Range Campsite. From here the track crosses then hugs close to Jenolan Road before diverting to the final descent to the limestone caves at Jenolan.|$|R
