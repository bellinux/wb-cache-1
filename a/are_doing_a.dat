25|$|There are two bright spots. One: We {{can improve}} the quality of care and cut costs without rationing. There are models out there for how to do it right -- the Mayo Clinic, the Geisinger Clinic in Pennsylvania, the Cleveland Clinic and California's Kaiser Permanente {{are just a few of}} the {{organized}} group practices that <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> better job for less. Their doctors are better than average at using the best medical evidence available. They're more likely to be using electronic medical records, which can help keep track of patients who have multiple physicians and need complex care. And they're less likely to provide unnecessary care.|$|E
40|$|When Michigan {{residents}} {{were asked to}} rate the performance of Jennifer Granholm as Michigan’s Governor, a majority of 57. 8 % indicated that they think she <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> good (42. 8 %) or excellent (15. 0 %) job. Some 42. 2 % think that she <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> fair (37. 7 %) or poor (4. 5 %) job. This indicates that there has not been much change since Granholm first took office in 2003. Previous State of the State Survey (SOSS- 29) results show that 58. 1 % thought that she <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> good (48. 2 %) or excellent (9. 9 %) job as governor between January and March of this year.

25|$|This game {{requires}} two players, {{a referee}} and three playing sets. Each player sees only his own board, while the referee {{can see them}} both and also has his own set. Players place stones on their boards, with no knowledge of what other players <b>are</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>A</b> referee keeps track of the game on the central board. If any player makes an illegal move, the referee informs him about it (some play that the referee says only that the move is illegal, while some, that the player is told whether the intersection is occupied or there is illegal ko capture).

500|$|The {{author was}} further {{prompted}} {{to write about}} grace when a friend told him about encountering a homeless prostitute in Chicago who began to cry as {{she told him that}} she had raised money for drugs by prostituting her two-year-old child. When Yancey's friend asked the woman if she had sought help at a local church, she answered, [...] "Church? Why would I ever go there? I was already feeling terrible about myself. They'd just make me feel worse." [...] This story convinced Yancey that Christians <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> poor job of communicating the message that God is willing to accept people, regardless of what they have done; the story haunted him, he said, because the woman was [...] "the type of person who would have gone to Jesus. The more unrighteous a person was, the more comfortable they felt around Jesus".|$|E

Saran has said [...] "When I studied in DPS Mathura Road in Delhi, there was a school for blind exactly opposite to our school. I used to go there every week and spend time seeing how these students played cricket and did other things normally. That is what inspired {{me to do something}} for these people". In an interview to TOI, the actress said: [...] "We feel sympathetic towards them, but we never employ them. We are scared because we have not grown up with them. While these people might be visually impaired, their other senses are very strong. So they can effectively give foot and back massages and treatments like reflexology.

500|$|Pujols did {{not perform}} very well to begin the 2012 season, batting [...]217 with no home runs and four RBIs {{in the month of}} April. Soon after the Angels called up top {{prospect}} Mike Trout and fired hitting coach Mickey Hatcher, Pujols's numbers began to rise, as he batted [...]323 with 13 home runs from May 15 through the All-Star Break. On July 31, he hit two home runs against Derek Holland in a 6–2 victory over the Rangers. After the game, Holland observed that Pujols had ended his early-season struggles: [...] "He's definitely turned it around, no doubt about it", he said. [...] "He is what he is. He had a slow start, but he's picked it up. He's a great hitter. He and Trout <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> great job picking [...] up."

500|$|Six {{years have}} passed, {{and it is}} 1893. Gaylord and Magnolia have moved to Chicago, where they make a {{precarious}} living from Gaylord's gambling. At first they are rich and enjoying the good life, singing the song [...] "Why Do I Love You?" [...] By 1903, they have a daughter, Kim, and after years of varying income, they are broke and rent a room in a boarding house. Depressed over his inability to support his family, Gaylord abandons [...] Magnolia and Kim. [...] Frank and Ellie, two former actors from the showboat, learn that Magnolia is living in the rooms they want to rent. The old friends seek a singing job for Magnolia at the Trocadero, the club where they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> New Year's show. Julie is working there. She has fallen into drinking after having been abandoned by Steve. At a rehearsal, she tries out the new song [...] "Bill." [...] She appears to be thinking of Steve and sings it with great emotion. From her dressing-room, she hears Magnolia singing [...] "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" [...] for her audition, the song which Julie taught her years ago. Julie secretly quits her job so that Magnolia can fill it, without learning of her sacrifice.|$|E

2500|$|I {{must confess}} I've still {{yet to be}} {{convinced}} that Cose is ready for test cricket. Last summer he earned his test place, and confirmed it with his century in Melbourne.

Gates said [...] "As a matter of principle and political reality, the Department of Defense cannot expect America's elected representatives to approve budget increases each year unless we <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> good job, indeed everything possible, to make every dollar count".

Champion believes that the owners <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> disservice to the real history, the people who should be honoured [...] "by remembering who they really were and what they actually did". He understands why people report strange occurrences, the ship still creaks and groans, and people's imaginations can get away from them such that they start seeing and hearing all kinds of things, attributing them to the paranormal which they have been primed for. [...] "Ghost stories are fine", concludes Champion [...] "when presented as such.

2500|$|On December 12, EU ministers {{remained}} {{divided on}} the issue of sending reinforcements; current president and French president Nicolas Sarkozy questioned the request, saying {{that it would be a}} better decision to draw troops from neighbouring countries instead of the distant EU. He declared, [...] "It is not that from Europe we don't wish to participate, but ... isn't it better to draw on regional forces first of all, who are all pretty well ready to go?" [...] Sarkozy cited the example of Angola, a regional power, who had earlier declared that they would support the Congolese government, and who the UN had alleged were already involved. Sarkozy also questioned the decision to reinforce MONUC peacekeepers, asking whether the extra 3,000 soldiers requested would be able to stop the conflict, saying [...] "There are 17,000 UN soldiers in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is the biggest ever operation and only 800 <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> useful job. Why send another 3,000?" [...] High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy Javier Solana will meet with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on December 15 at the United Nations Headquarters to discuss the issue further.
