40|$|Previous {{attempts}} to establish global mass balances for polychlorinated {{dioxins and furans}} (PCDD/Fs) {{have focused on the}} terrestrial sink, thereby neglecting deposition to the oceans and atmospheric losses. In this study, the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>sink</b> of polychlorinated dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) was calculated {{on the basis of their}} presence in soils. OH radical ([OH]) depletion reactions compete with atmospheric deposition fluxes for the fate of atmospheric PCDD/Fs. Three different steady state scenarios were considered: scenario A was a one-box atmosphere with globally averaged [OH], temperature (T), atmospheric lifetime (tlife), and a constant gas-particle partitioning (Φ); in scenario B, [OH], T, and Φ were averaged in a multibox atmosphere, with a constant tlife; and in scenario C, tlife was varied. In scenario A the strength of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>sink</b> was 2400 – 2800 kg/yr; in scenario B it was ∼ 2100 kg/yr; in scenario C, it was ∼ 1, 800 kg/yr (tlife = 5. 4 days) to ∼ 2, 800 kg/yr (tlife = 14 days). The majority of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>sink</b> was due to the depletion of Cl 4 DFs (1300 – 1400 kg/yr), followed by Cl 4 DDs (360 – 380 kg/yr) and Cl 5 DFs (230 – 240 kg/yr). On a global scale, major sinks for PCDD/Fs are the deposition to terrestrial soils and the oceans. For Cl 6 – 8 DDs, deposition to soils outweighs depletion reactions in the atmosphere and ocean uptake. The more volatile Cl 4 – 5 DD/Fs, however, are true “multimedia” compounds, with their estimated <b>atmospheric</b> <b>sink</b> being roughly as important as the terrestrial sink (in the case of Cl 5 DD/Fs) or outweighing it (e. g., Cl 4 DD/Fs) ...|$|E

40|$|Nitrous oxide {{is shown}} to undergo both a thermal and a {{photochemical}} decomposition at 296 K when it is adsorbed on various dry sands. The photochemical process occurs with light of wavelengths greater than 280 nm, where gaseous N 2 O does not absorb. At low pressures (less than 0. 1 torr) the half-life for the thermal decomposition of nitrous oxide to nitrogen when placed in contact with about 5 gm of heat-treated Tunisian sand in a one-liter vessel was 350 + or - 35 days. Under certain photolytic conditions this half-life was reduced. The efficiency of the photolytic process for a particular sand depends on the pressure and on the wavelength of light. For Tunisian sand at 1. 1 torr and with the full mercury arc, the destruction efficiency is about 0. 00002 molecule/incident photon.

It is a precursor to tropospheric ozone and it influences the atmosphere's oxidative capacity through its reaction with the hydroxyl radical, ethane's primary <b>atmospheric</b> <b>sink</b> (1 – 3).

We show that global ethane emission rates decreased from 14. 3 to 11. 3 teragrams per year, or by 21 per cent, from 1984 to 2010. We attribute this to decreasing fugitive emissions from ethane's fossil fuel source—most probably decreased venting and flaring of natural gas in oil fields—rather than a decline in its other major sources, biofuel use and biomass burning. Ethane's major emission sources are shared with methane, and recent studies have disagreed on whether reduced fossil fuel or microbial emissions have caused methane's atmospheric growth rate to slow (4, 5). Our findings suggest that reduced fugitive fossil fuel emissions account for at least 10 – 21 teragrams per year (30 – 70 per cent) of the decrease in methane's global emissions, significantly contributing to methane's slowing atmospheric growth rate since the mid- 1980 s...|$|E

We highlight the merits and shortcomings of each scavenging scheme at reproducing available measurements, which include concentrations in surface air and deposition, as well as vertical profiles observed over North America and western and central North Pacific. We show that model-measurement comparison of total deposition does not allow to distinguish between scavenging schemes because compensation effects can hide the differences in their respective scavenging efficiencies. Differences in scavenging parameterization affect the aerosol vertical distribution to a much greater extent than the surface concentration.

We use existing bottom-up constructions of the source history, including ''EDGAR''-based constructions, to assemble {{a model of the}} evolving global budget for methane and for its carbon isotope composition through the 20 th century. By matching such budgets to atmospheric data, we examine the constraints imposed by isotope information on those budget evolutions.

Specifically, methane evolution during the nuclear era is sensitive to the cycling dynamics of ''bomb 14 C'' (originating from atmospheric weapons tests) through the biosphere. In addition, since ca 1970, direct production and release of 14 CH 4 from nuclear-power facilities is influential but poorly quantified.

To sidestep these difficulties, we use here a simple budgeting approach to estimate land-atmosphere fluxes across North America by balancing the inflow and outflow of CO 2 from the troposphere. We base our study on the unique sampling strategy of atmospheric CO 2 vertical profiles over North America from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Earth System Research Laboratory aircraft network, from which we infer the three-dimensional CO 2 distribution over the continent.

Patra et al. 2016 b have used aircraft measurements over Sendai, Japan, to validate CH 4 emissions and emission increase rates for the East Asia region, and suggested that the rate of anthropogenic CH 4 emission increase should be only at 59 % of that is estimated for 2002 – 2010 by the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR 42 FT; Olivier et al. 2014). About 75 % of FFC CO 2 emissions and up to 40 % of anthropogenic CH 4 emissions are caused due to the coal/oil industry (mining and burning), which have produced 82 and 72 % of the increase in their emissions, respectively, in the period 2002 – 2010 (EDGAR 42 FT; [URL] Since the increase rate of CH 4 emissions over China is closely related to that of CO 2 emissions, we apply the CH 4 emission increase rate for correcting CO 2 emission increase rate.|$|E

We are exploring the use of polar ice cores to develop a long-term atmospheric history of atmospheric COS. In prior work, we presented a South Pole ice core record of COS for the last 2, 000 years suggesting that mean COS levels in the Southern Hemisphere preindustrial atmosphere were 331 ± 18 ppt (± 1 σ) (Aydin et al., 2008). Here, we present a new COS record based on ice cores from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet - Divide (WAIS-D) that covers the last 1, 000 years.

One of the questions regarding COS in ice core air is chemical stability towards hydrolysis. The WAIS-D site has a mean annual temperature 20 °C warmer than South Pole (- 30 °C vs - 50 °C). The agreement between the two records suggests that temperature-dependent hydrolysis of COS does not significantly effect the COS mixing ratio in ice core air on these time scales and the measurements likely reflect atmospheric COS levels.

Dry deposition of ozone to terrestrial surfaces governs its potential to cause damage and provides an important <b>atmospheric</b> <b>sink.</b> Ozone is very reactive so readily deposits on most surfaces. It is also taken in through stomata as the plant respires and this stomatal uptake can cause damage to the plant. Stomatal uptake is estimated using existing stomatal conductance models that have been well characterized and evaluated. However non-stomatal deposition has not been well described in land-atmosphere exchange models to date. Several sets of ozone flux measurements have been collated to examine the non-stomatal deposition process. The data showed ozone deposition increased to dry canopies as temperature or solar radiation increased, consistent with the thermal decomposition of ozone on leaf cuticles or reactions with emitted biogenic VOCs. It was also found that the presence of surface water increased ozone deposition, probably due to aqueous chemical reactions with compounds in the water; therefore this may depend on the composition of cuticular waxes or the presence of other deposited compounds. A new parameterisation for non-stomatal ozone deposition to grassland and coniferous forests is derived and incorporated into a standard resistance type deposition model.

As the primary <b>atmospheric</b> <b>sink</b> for OH, {{which is responsible for}} chemically destroying numerous air pollutants, CO concentrations impact the concentrations of other such pollutants. Here we use CO as a tracer for polluted air masses by examining the transport of CO both to and from North America. CO is an ideal tracer for atmospheric and climate modeling because it is well understood and well captured due to its simple chemistry and long lifespan. By employing MOZART, a numerical global tropospheric chemistry model, we seek to address the nature of air pollutant transport and establish the role of transport on regional North American CO concentrations. We find that the greatest intercontinental transported CO occurs on days when the overall carbon monoxide concentrations are low to moderate. In addition, carbon monoxide concentrations increase eastward, reflecting the different regional impacts of emissions. We also define three main transport pathways of CO over North America and identify specific episodic flux events by comparing model results to INTEX-NA flight observations taken the summer of 2004 in cooperation with NASA, NOAA, and the ICARn campaign. The main pathways of CO transport over North America are eastward, aloft import from Asia; northward, surface import from Africa, attributed to heavy biomass burning in the summer; and eastward export from North America, at the surface and aloft. Understanding these pathways for CO transport and the regional impacts is a key step towards understanding how polluted air masses evolve and can provide insight into the extent to which local air quality is influenced by intercontinental transport...|$|E

In order to resolve the inconsistency between observations (1, 2, 3) and 4 a one-dimensional three-layer model was constructed. A positive correlation between CaCO 3 and fCO 2 as obtained when the model was parameterized with data obtained from field and mesocosm studies. The correlation is a feature of the decay phase of a bloom and represents a decrease of fCO(2) with a decrease of CaCO 3. Thus it represents the dissolution and sedimentation of CaCO 3 rather than its production. Having resolved the ambiguity within the field data by adding the dimension of time in the model, blooms of E. huxleyi can be identified as sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide. This sink is a function of the calcification to photosynthesis (C:P) ratio of the nitrate-using phytoplankton and is maximal when the C:P ratio is 0. 42 (that is, E. huxleyi constitutes 97 % of the nitrate-using phytoplankton). Rather than using the model for making accurate predictions about the magnitude of this sink, a sensitivity analysis was performed to give a range of magnitudes for the range of parameter values that were obtained during previous studies. Furthermore, gaps were identified in the current knowledge of carbon fluxes within blooms of E. huxleyi. [References: 33...|$|E
40|$|Carbonyl {{sulphide}} (COS) is {{a potential}} tracer of gross primary productivity (GPP), assuming a unidirectional COS flux into the vegetation that scales with GPP. However, carbonic anhydrase (CA), the enzyme that hydrolyses COS, {{is expected to be}} light independent, and thus plants without stomata should continue to take up COS in the dark. We measured net CO 2 (A(C)) and COS (A(S)) uptake rates from two astomatous bryophytes at different relative water contents (RWCs), COS concentrations, temperatures and light intensities. We found large A(S) in the dark, indicating that CA activity continues without photosynthesis. More surprisingly, we found a nonzero COS compensation point in light and dark conditions, indicating a temperature-driven COS source with a Q 10 (fractional change for a 10 °C temperature increase) of 3. 7. This resulted in greater A(S) in the dark than in the light at similar RWC. The processes underlying such COS emissions remain unknown. Our results suggest that ecosystems dominated by bryophytes might be strong <b>atmospheric</b> <b>sinks</b> of COS at night and weaker sinks or even sources of COS during daytime. Biotic COS production in bryophytes could result from symbiotic fungal and bacterial partners that could also be found on vascular plants.

40|$|AbstractThe {{impact of}} {{including}} {{a more detailed}} VOC oxidation scheme (CRI v 2 -R 5) with a multi-generational approach for simulating tropospheric acetone is investigated using a 3 -D global model, STOCHEM-CRI. The CRI v 2 -R 5 mechanism contains photochemical production of acetone from monoterpenes which account for 64 % (46. 8  Tg/yr) of the global acetone sources in STOCHEM-CRI. Both photolysis and oxidation by OH in the troposphere contributes equally (42 %, each) and dry deposition contributes 16 % of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>sinks</b> of acetone. The tropospheric life-time and the global burden of acetone {{are found to be}} 18 days and 3. 5  Tg, respectively, these values being close to those reported in the study of Jacob et al. (2002). A dataset of aircraft campaign measurements are used to evaluate the inclusion of acetone formation from monoterpenes in the CRI v 2 -R 5 mechanism used in STOCHEM-CRI. The overall comparison between measurements and models show that the parameterised approach in STOCHEM-NAM (no acetone formation from monoterpenes) underpredicts the mixing ratios of acetone in the atmosphere. However, using a detailed monoterpene oxidation mechanism forming acetone has brought the STOCHEM-CRI into closer agreement with measurements with an improvement in the vertical simulation of acetone. The annual mean surface distribution of acetone simulated by the STOCHEM-CRI shows a peak over forested regions where there are large biogenic emissions and high levels of photochemical activity. Year-long observations of acetone and methanol at the Mace Head research station in Ireland are compared with the simulated acetone and methanol produced by the STOCHEM-CRI and found to produce good overall agreement between model and measurements. The seasonal variation of model and measured acetone levels at Mace Head, California, New Hampshire and Minnesota show peaks in summer and dips in winter, suggesting that photochemical production may have the strongest effect on its seasonal trend...|$|R
