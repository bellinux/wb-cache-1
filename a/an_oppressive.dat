5|$|By {{the time}} of Stanley's {{election}} to the House, the American Tobacco Company had eliminated all its substantial competitors either by acquisition or by driving them out of business. The company worked with British tobacco manufacturers to set tobacco prices worldwide. Congressman Stanley came {{to the defense of}} the tobacco farmers of his district, making him virtually unbeatable as a congressional candidate. In the first of his five consecutive terms, he authored a bill that would remove <b>an</b> <b>oppressive</b> national tobacco tax, hoping this would help raise prices for unprocessed tobacco. The bill was defeated by extensive lobbying efforts by the American Tobacco Company. In 1904, he convinced the Ways and Means Committee to hold public hearings on the American Tobacco Company's monopolistic actions, but the hearings did not convince legislators to repeal the tax nor take action against the American Tobacco Company.|$|E
5|$|The novel has {{pervasive}} lesbian themes, {{concentrating on}} eroticism and self-discovery. Waters {{was working on}} a PhD dissertation in English literature when she decided to write a story she would like to read. Employing her love for the variety of people and districts in London, she consciously chose an urban setting. As opposed to previous lesbian-themed fiction she had read where the characters escape <b>an</b> <b>oppressive</b> society to live apart from it, Waters chose characters who interact with their surroundings. She has acknowledged that the book imagines a lesbian presence and history in Victorian London where none was recorded. The main character's experiences in the theatrical profession and her perpetual motion through the city allow her to make observations on social conditions while exploring the issues of gender, sexism, and class difference.|$|E
5|$|Although Domnall {{had earlier}} opposed Muirchertach over the kingship of Munster, he possessed strong {{familial}} {{connections with the}} Isles through his maternal descent from Echmarcach. In fact, the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster reveals {{that at least two}} apparent members of Echmarcach's family were killed less than a decade before in a repulsed invasion of Mann. As a result of their demise, Domnall may well have become the leading male representative of his mother's family. From the standpoint of the Uí Briain, the union of Domnall's parents would, therefore, seem to have been orchestrated in the context of extending Uí Briain authority into the Isles. In 1096, the Annals of the Four Masters reveals that Domnall's brother, Amlaíb, lost his life on Mann, apparently whilst supporting Domnall's undertaking in the Isles. This source not only corroborates Uí Briain intervention in the Isles, but suggests that Domnall {{and the rest of the}} Meic Taidc faced significant opposition there, possibly in the form of Lagmann's adherents. The chronicle credits Domnall with <b>an</b> <b>oppressive</b> three-year reign that ended when the leading Islesmen revolted against him, and drove him from the kingdom back to Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Ua Briain was {{certainly}} a formidable potential ally, having recently imposed his dominance over the kingdoms of Connacht, Leinster, Mide, and Dublin as well. In fact, it was through his conquest of the latter that Ua Briain had banished Lǫgmaðr's father from Ireland once and for all, and thereby secured control of Dublin's awesome naval power. In consequence of this predominance, the clause as stated by the chroniclethat Ua Briain was to provide the Isles with a regent from his own kinmay {{well have been a}} condition on his intervention, rather than a request of the Islesmen themselves. Whatever the case, the chronicle reveals that Ua Briain then installed Domnall mac Taidc (died 1115) upon the throne. Although Domnall had previously opposed Ua Briain over the kingship of Munster, {{he was the son of}} Ua Briain's brother, and further possessed strong familial connections with the Isles through his maternal descent from Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles (died 1064/1065). In fact, the Annals of Ulster appears to indicate that at least two apparent members of Echmarcach's family were killed less than a decade before in a repulsed invasion of Mann. As a result, Domnall may have been the leading male representative of Echmarcach's family. The slaying of Domnall's brother, Amlaíb, as recorded by the Annals of the Four Masters in 1096, suggests that Domnall and the rest of the Meic Taidc faced significant opposition in the Isles, possibly in the form of Lǫgmaðr's adherents. The chronicle credits Domnall with <b>an</b> <b>oppressive</b> three-year reign that ended when the leading Islesmen revolted against him, and drove him from the kingdom back to Ireland.|$|E
