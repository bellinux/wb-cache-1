500|$|The film {{features}} {{a number of}} scenes which involve Detectives Frazier and Mitchell (Chiwitel Ejiofor) interrogating several hostages during {{the aftermath of the}} heist. Libatique described these scenes as a [...] "flash-forward" [...] to events, explaining that Lee [...] "wanted a look that would jump out <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> you’re somewhere else." [...] Libatique photographed the scenes with Kodak Ektachrome 100D 5285 reversal film. Technicolor then cross-processed the filmed footage before it was put through a bleach bypass, which neutralized color temperature and created more contrast. Libatique explained, [...] "Basically, it unifies all the color...When you try to apply correction, the film moves in very strange ways." ...|$|E

500|$|Scott {{is known}} for his skill at filming with {{multiple}} camera set-ups and Body of Lies used a minimum of three simultaneously. Witt explained the benefits, [...] "Actors like multiple cameras because they’re always on-camera, so they’re always in character and not wasting time off-camera." [...] One shot of DiCaprio alone in the desert, for example, still used three cameras: one hand-held above the actor, a second capturing a three-quarter back profile, and the third photographing a close-up through the first cameraman's legs. Richard Cronn, the gaffer, attributed the success of this difficult approach to Scott's filmmaking intelligence, [...] "Ridley will stand at the monitors <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what's he's looking for – he'll look at four monitors and say, 'I'm cutting from this to this to this.' He knows exactly how he will cut it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Runner {{up of the}} {{eleventh}} series, Vana Koutsomitis criticized the living conditions that candidates live in; granted they are accommodated in a lavish house, Vana claimed that the bosses impose living conditions similar to Big Brother - with strict rules and zero contact with outsiders.

2500|$|The 2nd Test match {{witnessed}} many controversial umpiring decisions {{from the}} two umpires - Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson and even the third Umpire. Three of Steve Bucknor's gaffes occurred {{when he did not}} give Andrew Symonds out caught behind at 30 when TV Replays clearly showed that the ball had passed through the bat's edge. The second one occurred when Bucknor did not refer a stumping call against Andrew Symonds to the third umpire. Replays showed the Australia all-rounder’s foot wasn't grounded inside the crease when the bails came off. This was a major boost for Australia as Symonds went on to make 162 not out and brought Australia back into the Game. After these incidents, Andrew Symonds said, [...] "I was very lucky. I was out when I was 30, given not out. That's cricket though, I can sit here <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about my bad decisions as well - but I won't."

2500|$|As with {{previous}} sessions, Mike Sapone acted {{as both a}} band member and co-producer, while the band were also involved in the albums production. Discussing Sapone's involvement, Lacey defined Sapone as having [...] "as much at stake with the music as we do; he's as invested in it as we are, sometimes more." [...] Accardi described Sapone as having [...] "an uncanny ability to hear something you’re doing and immediately track it to any song in his library that he stores in his brain. He'll go to it, {{show it to you}} <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that that’s what needs to happen. Here's the better version of it. This is what you’re trying to do and you don't even realize it." [...] Most of the songs were brought to the studio in acoustic form, sometimes as a complete song and sometimes as just a part or riff. The band would then build upon these ideas, recording everything as they worked. The band members were not limited by their normal roles within Brand New, with much instrument swapping and experimenting taking place in writing individual parts. Lacey later commented that [...] "it was such a collaborative effort with the band. Vin might write a drum part or Brian might write a guitar part or whatever. We're not really keeping tabs of how much everyone has at stake on each song".|$|E
2500|$|Evans played Shakespeare's Cleopatra for {{the last}} time in 1946–47, in her late fifties. Her {{performance}} divided the critics: opinions varied from [...] "an agonising disaster" [...] to [...] "a joy to watch". Kenneth Tynan said, [...] "Lady Bracknell has been involved in a low Alexandrian scandal". Evans had never been classically good looking, but she was a great enough actress to [...] "convey beauty without being conventionally beautiful". What troubled many, including Agate and Gielgud, about her Cleopatra and other tragic heroines was not her appearance but a sense that tragedy came less naturally to her than comedy. Some of the great Shakespearian tragic roles she constantly refused to play, notably Lady Macbeth. She told Gielgud, [...] "I could never impersonate a woman who had such a peculiar notion of hospitality", which he took to mean that she could not contemplate the character's [...] "explicit admission of evil". Evans once remarked, [...] "I don't think there is anything extraordinary about me except this passion for the truth", a passion revered by Gielgud and others, but one that prevented her from attempting a character whose essence she could not understand. She said to Shaw that she had been asked to play Volumnia in Coriolanus, but [...] "isn't she a bloodthirsty old harridan? I could never play her." [...] This did not mean that she had to like the characters she played, but she had to understand them. When she first read through the role of Lady Bracknell with Gielgud she commented, [...] "I know those sort of women. They ring the bell <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> to put a lump of coal on the fire." ...|$|E
