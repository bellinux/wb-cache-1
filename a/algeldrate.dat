5000|$|Under {{the generic}} name <b>algeldrate,</b> {{aluminium}} hydroxide {{is used as}} an antacid. Aluminium hydroxide is preferred over other alternatives such as sodium bicarbonate because Al(OH)3, being insoluble, does not increase the pH of stomach above 7 and hence, does not trigger secretion of excess stomach acid. Brand names include Alu-Cap, Aludrox, Gaviscon, and Pepsamar. In 2016 Gaviscon {{was one of the}} biggest selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of Â£62 million. [...] It reacts with excess acid in the stomach, reducing the acidity of the stomach content, [...] which may relieve the symptoms of ulcers, heartburn or dyspepsia. Such products can cause constipation, because the aluminum ions inhibit the contractions of smooth muscle cells in the gastrointestinal tract, slowing peristalsis and lengthening the time needed for stool to pass through the colon. [...] Some such products (such as Maalox) are formulated to minimize such effects through the inclusion of equal concentrations of magnesium hydroxide or magnesium carbonate, which have counterbalancing laxative effects.|$|E
40|$|Interaction between drugs {{constitutes}} a frequent cause of adverse drug reaction. The {{aim of this}} study, was to provide an analysis of potential drug interactions. The study groups were 225 patients from the dialysis unit and 519 patients from the heart failure centre. Discharge prescriptions from the two units were collected for six months during 2011. In the heart failure centre, 74 % of patients received prescriptions for drug combinations that may have adverse interactions. The most frequent and important potential interactions concerned furosemide with enalapril, 17 %, and acetylsalicylic acid with metoprolol, 15 %. In the dialysis unit, 19 % of patients received prescriptions that may have adverse interactions. Two examples were <b>algeldrate</b> with amlodipine, 6 %, In 1. 3 % of patients increase in INR occurred owing to interactions. The results have revealed particularly high risk for potential interactions in heart failure centre patients because of the prescription of many drugs {{and because of the}} types of these drugs.
