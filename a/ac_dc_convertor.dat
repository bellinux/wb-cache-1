40|$|Following the {{extension}} and increase in capacity of power electronic elements, many convertors with special applications have been designed. Convertors such as rectifiers, <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> power supplies, <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> drivers and so on. At present, optimization of these convertors, decreasing loss and {{bringing down the}} electromagnetic interference are desired. In this paper, a <b>DC</b> to <b>DC</b> <b>convertor</b> for controlling the speed  of DC motor is designed and  one prototype is presented in which switching losses is close to zero {{and it has a}} very low electromagnetic interference. In this convertor, the switches  turn on and turn off approximately with zero current. The speed of motor is controlled by PWM.  This plan includes advantages of  PWM and resonant convertors. The disadvantages, such as;  high switching losses and changing switching  frequency  for controlling output were removed. As switching frequency has a direct relation with switching losses, when losses decreased, it is possible to increase the frequency, then volume and weight of passive filter elements can be decreased. Besides, by decreasing the losses,  the need of  heatsink, which is  the heavy and voluminous elements of convertors, can be removed...|$|R

30|$|The use of HVDC Flexible {{technology}} {{to realize the}} power grid interconnection can not only complete the power exchange function between power grids, but also solve dynamic stability, black start of power grids and excessive short-circuit current and other issues in a large-scale power grid. All of these advantages of the HVDC Flexible rely on its quick and independent reactive power adjustment, “black start” capability, no short-circuit current indeed and other technical characteristics. Furthermore, the dimension of a HVDC Flexible convertor station is smaller {{than that of a}} conventional <b>DC</b> <b>convertor</b> station with the same capacity, thus the HVDC Flexible convertor station can be built close to the load center.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a hybrid AC/DC micro grid which will reduces {{the process of}} several reverse conversions in an individual <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> grid. The renewable sources such as wind generators, photovoltaic panels and fuel cell are connected to a hybrid grid. AC sources and loads are linked with <b>AC</b> grid and <b>DC</b> sources and loads are linked with DC grid. The proposed hybrid grid operates in a grid-tied or autonomous mode. Both <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> networks are connected by a multi- bidirectional converter. This multi-bidirectional converter operates in parallel with <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> grid. Hence, demand over an individual grid can be coordinately controlled by multi-bidirectional converter. The co-ordination control algorithm at the bidirectional converter is proposed. Co-ordination control provides uninterrupted and smooth power transfer between <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> link. A hybrid grid has modeled and simulated using the Simulink in the MATLAB. The simulation {{results show that the}} system can provides uninterrupted power, smooth power transfer between <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> link and also manage the demand...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} fault ride-through (FRT) {{capability}} of a hybrid AC/DC microgrid during both <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> network faults. In this investigation, commonly proposed FRT {{strategies for the}} distributed energy resources and <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> microgrids are implemented while the interlinking bidirectional converter is operated in power transfer mode. The investigations have shown that improvement in the AC network voltage is minimal during both <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> network faults. However, the DC network voltage improves and rapidly recovers after both <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> network faults. This is because while the AC network is relatively weak during the fault, the interlinking bi-directional converter tracks the pre-fault power reference following the fault clearance and assists with restoration of the DC bus voltage. However, this response could be detrimental if the hybrid AC/DC microgrid is operated in an islanded mode. Hence {{it is important to}} design a robust fault ride-through support scheme for the interlinking bi-directional converter in a hybrid AC/DC microgrid...|$|R
