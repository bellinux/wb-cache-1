40|$|ABSTRACT. The three-parameter {{hydraulic}} model of snow avalanche dynamics including the coefficients of dry and turbulent friction and {{the coefficient of}} new-snow-mass entrainment was investigated. The ‘Domestic ’ avalanche site in Elbrus region, Caucasus, Russia, {{was chosen as the}} model <b>avalanche</b> <b>range.</b> According to the model, the fixed avalanche run-out can be achieved with various combinations of model parameters. At the fixed value of the coefficient of entrainment me, we have a curve on a plane of the coefficients of dry and turbulent friction. It was found that the family of curves (me is a parameter) are crossed at the single point. The value of the coefficient of turbulent friction at the cross-point remained practically constant for the maximum and average avalanche run-outs. The conclusions obtained are confirmed by the results of modelling for six arbitrarily chosen avalanche sites: three in the Khibiny mountains, Kola Peninsula, Russia, two in the Elbrus region and one idealized site with an exponential longitudinal profile. The dependences of run-out on the coefficient of dry friction are constructed for all the investigated avalanche sites. The results are important for the statistical simulation of avalanche dynamics since they suggest the possibility of using only one random model parameter, namely, the coefficient of dry friction, in the model. The histograms and distribution functions of the coefficient of dry friction are constructed and presented for avalanche sites Nos 22 and 43 (Khibiny mountains) and ‘Domestic’, with the available series of field data...|$|E

The coarse debris, derived from weathered gneissic bedrock and its glacial-till mantle, varies from highly immature to mature. The depositional processes are mainly <b>avalanches,</b> <b>ranging</b> from rockfalls and debris¯ows to snow¯ows, but include also water¯ow and debris creep. The mechanics and sedimentary products of these processes are discussed, with special emphasis on snow avalanches, whose role {{as an agent of}} debris transport is little-known to sedimentologists. The subsequent analysis of sedimentary successions is focused on colluvial-fan deltas, which are very speci®c, yet little-studied, coastal depositional systems. The stratigraphic variation and depositional architecture of the colluvial facies assemblages, constrained by abundant radiometric dates, are used to decipher the signal of regional climatic changes from the sedimentary record. The stratigraphic data from two dozen local colluvial successions are compiled and further compared with other types of regional palaeoclimatic proxy record. The analysis suggests that the colluvial systems, although dependent upon local geomorphic conditions, have acted as highly sensitive recorders of regional climatic changes.

40|$|Snow {{avalanches}} in mountainous areas pose {{a significant}} threat to infrastructure (roads, railways, energy transmission corridors), personal property (homes) and recreational {{areas as well}} as for lives of people living and moving in alpine terrain. The impacts of snow <b>avalanches</b> <b>range</b> from delays and financial loss through road and railway closures, destruction of property and infrastructure, to loss of life. Avalanche warnings today are mainly based on meteorological information, snow pack information, field observations, historically recorded avalanche events as well as experience and expert knowledge. The ability to automatically identify snow avalanches using Very High Resolution (VHR) optical remote sensing imagery has the potential to assist in the development of accurate, spatially widespread, detailed maps of zones prone to avalanches as well as to build up data bases of past avalanche events in poorly accessible regions. This would provide decision makers with improved knowledge of the frequency and size distributions of avalanches in such areas. We used an object–oriented image interpretation approach, which employs segmentation and classification methodologies, to detect recent snow avalanche deposits within VHR panchromatic optical remote sensing imagery. This produces avalanche deposit maps, which can be integrated with other spatial mapping and terrain data. The object-oriented approach has been tested and validated against manually generated maps in which avalanches are visually recognized and digitized. The accuracy (both users and producers) are over 0. 9 with errors of commission less than 0. 05. Future research is directed to widespread testing of the algorithm on data generated by various sensors and improvement of the algorithm in high noise regions as well as the mapping of avalanche paths alongside their deposits...|$|R

Our results show that, for a given avalanche width, the breakdown probability of In 0. 52 Al 0. 48 As SPADs increases faster with overbias than InP SPADs. When we compared their timing statistics, we observed that, for a given breakdown probability, InP requires a shorter time to reach breakdown and exhibits a smaller timing jitter than In 0. 52 Al 0. 48 As. However, due to the lower dark count probability and faster rise in breakdown probability with overbias, In 0. 52 Al 0. 48 As SPADs with avalanche widths <= 0. 5 mu m {{are more suitable for}} single-photon detection at telecommunication wavelengths than InP SPADs. Moreover, we predict that, in InP SPADs with avalanche widths <= 0. 3 mu m and In 0. 52 Al 0. 48 As SPADs with avalanche widths <= 0. 2 mu m, the dark count probability is higher than the photon count probability for all applied biases...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe 3 D global edge {{turbulence}} code TOKAM 3 X is used {{to study}} the properties of edge particle turbulent transport in circular limited plasmas, including both closed and open flux surfaces. Turbulence is driven by an incoming particle flux from the core plasma and no scale separation between the equilibrium and the fluctuations is assumed. Simulations show {{the existence of a}} complex self-organization of turbulence transport coupling scales ranging from a few Larmor radii up to the machine scale. Particle transport is largely dominated by small scale turbulence with fluctuations forming quasi field-aligned filaments. Radial particle transport is intermittent and associated with the propagation of coherent structures on long distances via <b>avalanches.</b> Long <b>range</b> correlations are also found in the poloidal and toroidal direction. The statistical properties of fluctuations vary with the radial and poloidal directions, with larger fluctuation levels and intermittency found in the outboard scrape-off layer (SOL). Radial turbulent transport is strongly ballooned, with 90 % of the flux at the separatrix flowing through the low-field side. One of the main consequences is the existence of quasi-sonic asymmetric parallel flows driving a net rotation of the plasma. Simulations also show the spontaneous onset of an intermittent E × B rotation characterized by a larger shear at the separatrix. Strong correlation is found between the turbulent particle flux and the E × B flow shear in a phenomenology reminiscent of H-mode physics.

For land-use planning and management purposes, a good knowledge of extreme run-out zones and frequencies of avalanches is required. In the present work, vegetation recognition (especially focused on Pinus uncinata trees) and dendrochronological techniques are used to characterize avalanches {{that have occurred in}} historical times, helping to determine both the extent of large or extreme avalanches and their occurrence in time. Vegetation was studied at the Canal del Roc Roig (eastern Pyrenees, Spain) avalanche path. The avalanches descending this path affect the railway that reaches the Vall de Núria resort and the run-up to the opposite slope. During winter 1996, two important avalanches affecting this path were well documented. These are compared with the results of the vegetation study, consisting of an inventory of flora, the recording of vegetation damages along eight transverse profiles at different altitudes on the path and a dendrochronological sampling campaign.

A radar altimeter that meets these strict requirements could obtain a global prespective of lunar topography with a few kilometers spatial resolution and 10 m vertical resolution from a lunar orbit of 100 km. A prototype model is being constructed of the Lunar Observer Laser Altimeter (LOLA) capable of continuously measuring the range to the lunar surface with sub-meter vertical resolution within a 30 to 300 m diameter surface footprint. This same instrument is also designed to provide a direct measure of the surface height distribution in the footprint by waveform analysis of the backscattered laser pulse.

Thanks to the outstanding timing precision of single-photon avalanche diodes and the optimized measurement circuitry, a typical resolution of 97 ps was achieved within a range of 100 ns. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this imager is the first fully integrated system for photon time-of-arrival evaluation.

When operated as an optical rangefinder, this design has enabled us to reconstruct 3 -D scenes with milimetric precisions in extremely low signal exposure. A laser source was used to illuminate the scene up to 3. 75 m with an average power of 1 mW, a field-of-view of 5 and under 150 lux of constant background light.

This paper combines historical data with detailed geomorphological mapping, stratigraphic observation, and absolute and relative dating, to interpret several deposits resulting from rock avalanching onto glaciers. Nineteen rock falls and rock <b>avalanches</b> are described, <b>ranging</b> in volume from 10, 000 m 3 to 10 × 106 m 3. They occurred between 2500 BP and AD 2007 at six sites. The events at three sites (Miage and Drus Glaciers, and Tour des Grandes Jorasses) are characterised by short travel distances; those at Brenva, Triolet, and Frébouge Glaciers exhibit excessive travel distances. Interactions between rock avalanches and glaciers are of four types: (i) rock-avalanche triggering, where glacial and paraglacial controls include debuttressing of rockwalls due to glacier thinning and retreat, oversteepening of rock slopes by glacial erosion, and effects of glaciers on permafrost; (ii) rock-avalanche mobility, in which mobility and travel distance are modified by channelling of rock-avalanche debris by moraines and valleys, incorporation of ice and snow (often > 50 % for large events), and irregularities on the glacier surface; (iii) deposit sedimentology, where melting of incorporated ice transforms the final deposit by reducing its thickness typically to < 5 m, and debris of variable thicknesses is juxtaposed in a hummocky deposit with chaotic piles of angular rock debris; and (iv) glacier dynamics where insulating debris deposited upon a glacier produces a debris-covered glacier of different dynamics, and high elevated scars can favour the formation of small glaciers...|$|R

It possesses features of supported membranes, such as flatness, large area coverage and high mechanical stability, and of giant vesicles, {{such as the ability}} to encapsulate nanoparticles in its interior volume.

40|$|In arctic and alpine {{high relief}} landscapes snow {{avalanches}} are traditionally ranked behind rockfall {{in terms of}} their significance for mass wasting processes of rock slopes. Cornice fall avalanches are at present the most dominant snow avalanche type at two slope systems, called Nybyen and Larsbreen, in the valley Longyeardalen in Central Svalbard. Both slope systems are situated on NW-facing lee slopes underneath large summit plateau, where cornices form annually, and high frequency and magnitude cornice fall avalanching is observed by daily automatic time-lapse photography. In addition, rock debris sedimentation by these cornice fall avalanches was measured directly in either permanent sediment traps or by snow inventories. The results from a maximum of 7 yr of measurements in a total of 13 catchments show maximum <b>avalanche</b> sedimentation rates <b>ranging</b> from 8. 2 to 38. 7 kg m&minus; 2 at Nybyen and from 0. 8 to 55. 4 kg m&minus; 2 at Larsbreen.

This comparably efficient rock slope mass wasting is due to collapsing cornices producing cornice fall avalanche with high rock debris content throughout the entire winter.

40|$|In Kazakhstan, area of 124 {{thousand}} km 2 {{is prone}} to the avalanche hazard. Avalanches are released down in mountain regions situated along the eastern boundary of Kazakhstan. Systematic studies of avalanches here were started in 1958 by explorer I. S. Sosedov; later on, I. V. Seversky continued these investigations in Institute of Geography of the Kazakh Soviet Republic. Actually, he founded the Kazakh school of the avalanche studies. In 1970 – 1980 s, five snow-avalanche stations operated in Kazakhstan: two in Il’ Alatau, two in Zhetysu Alatau, {{and one in the}} Altai. At the present time, only two stations and two snow-avalanche posts operate, and all of them are located in Il’ Alatau. Since 1951 to 2013, 75 avalanches took place in Kazakhstan, releases of them caused significant damages. For this period 172 people happened to be under avalanches, among them 86 perished. Large avalanche catastrophes causing human victims and destructions took place in Altai in 1977 and in Karatau in 1990. In spring of 1966, only in Il’ Alatau avalanches destroyed more 600 ha of mature fir (coniferous) forest, and the total area of forest destroyed here by avalanches amounts to 2677 ha or 7 % of the total forest area. For 48 years of the avalanche observations, there were 15 winters with increased avalanche activity in the river Almatinka basin when total volume of released snow exceeded annual mean value of 147 thousand m 3. During this period, number of days with winter avalanches changed from three (in season of 1973 / 1974) to 28 (1986 / 1987), the average for a year is 16 days for a season. Winter with the total volume of snow 1300 thousand m 3 occur once in 150 years. Individual avalanches with maximal volume of 350 thousand m 3 happen once in 80 years. Preventive avalanche releases aimed at protection of roads and settlements are used in Kazakhstan since 1974. These precautions are taken in Il’ Alatau, Altai, and on Kalbinsky <b>Range.</b> <b>Avalanches</b> are released with the use of explosives. Protective constructions are built very rarely.

40|$|The steep forearc slope {{along the}} {{northern}} sector of the obliquely convergent Hikurangi subduction zone is characteristic of non-accretionary and tectonically eroding continental margins, with reduced sediment supply in the trench relative to further south, {{and the presence of}} seamount relief on the Hikurangi Plateau. These seamounts influence the subduction process and the structurally-driven geomorphic development of the over-riding margin of the Australian Plate frontal wedge. The Poverty Indentation represents an unusual, especially challenging and therefore exciting location to investigate the tectonic and eustatic effects on this sedimentary system because of: (i) the geometry and obliquity of the subducting seamounts; (ii) the influence of multiple repeated seamount impacts; (iii) the effects of structurally-driven over-steeping and associated widespread occurrence of gravitational collapse and mass movements; and (iv) the development of a large canyon system down the axis of the indentation. High quality bathymetric and backscatter images of the Poverty Indentation submarine re-entrant across {{the northern part of the}} Hikurangi margin were obtained by scientists from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) (Lewis, 2001) using a SIMRAD EM 300 multibeam swath-mapping system, hull-mounted on NIWA’s research vessel Tangaroa. The entire accretionary slope of the re-entrant was mapped, at depths ranging from 100 to 3500 metres. The level of seafloor morphologic resolution is comparable with some of the most detailed Digital Elevation Maps (DEM) onshore. The detailed digital swath images are complemented by the availability of excellent high-quality processed multi-channel seismic reflection data, single channel high-resolution 3. 5 kHz seismic reflection data, as well as core samples. Combined, these data support this study of the complex interactions of tectonic deformation with slope sedimentary processes and slope submarine geomorphic evolution at a convergent margin. The origin of the Poverty Indentation, on the inboard trench-slope at the transition from the northern to central sectors of the Hikurangi margin, is attributed to multiple seamount impacts over the last c. 2 Myr period. This has been accompanied by canyon incision, thrust fault propagation into the trench fill, and numerous large-scale gravitational collapse structures with multiple debris flow and <b>avalanche</b> deposits <b>ranging</b> in down-slope length from a few hundred metres to more than 40 km. The indentation is directly offshore of the Waipaoa River which is currently estimated to have a high sediment yield into the marine system. The indentation is recognised as the “Sink” for sediments derived from the Waipaoa River catchment, one of two target river systems chosen for the US National Science Foundation (NSF) -funded MARGINS “Source-to-Sink” initiative. The Poverty Canyon stretches 70 km from the continental shelf edge directly offshore from the Waipaoa to the trench floor, incising into the axis of the indentation. The sediment delivered to the margin from the Waipaoa catchment and elsewhere during sea-level high-stands, including the Holocene, has remained largely trapped in a large depocentre on the Poverty shelf, while during low-stand cycles, sediment bypassed the shelf to develop a prograding clinoform sequence out onto the upper slope. The formation of the indentation and the development of the upper branches of the Poverty Canyon system have led to the progressive removal of a substantial part of this prograding wedge by mass movements and gully incision. Sediment has also accumulated in the head of the Poverty Canyon and episodic mass flows contribute significantly to continued modification of the indentation by driving canyon incision and triggering instability in the adjacent slopes. Prograding clinoforms lying seaward of active faults beneath the shelf, and overlying a buried inactive thrust system beneath the upper slope, reveal a history of deformation accompanied by the creation of accommodation space. There is some more recent activity on shelf faults (i. e. Lachlan Fault) and at the transition into the lower margin, but reduced (~ 2 %) or no evidence of recent deformation for the majority of the upper to mid-slope. This is in contrast to current activity (approximately 24 to 47 % shortening) across the lower slope and frontal wedge regions of the indentation. The middle to lower Poverty Canyon represents a structural transition zone within the indentation coincident with the indentation axis. The lower to mid-slope south of the canyon conforms more closely to a classic accretionary slope deformation style with a series of east-facing thrust-propagated asymmetric anticlines separated by early-stage slope basins. North of the canyon system, sediment starvation and seamount impact has resulted in frontal tectonic erosion associated with the development of an over-steepened lower to mid-slope margin, fault reactivation and structural inversion and over-printing. Evidence points to at least three main seamount subduction events within the Poverty Indentation, each with different margin responses: i) 	older substantial seamount impact that drove the first-order perturbation in the margin, since approximately ~ 1 - 2 Ma ii) 	subducted seamount(s) now beneath Pantin and Paritu Ridge complexes, initially impacting on the margin approximately ~ 0. 5 Ma, and iii) 	incipient seamount subduction of the Puke Seamount at the current deformation front. The overall geometry and geomorphology of the wider indentation appears to conform to the geometry accompanying the structure observed in sandbox models after the seamount has passed completely through the deformation front. The main morphological features correlating with sandbox models include: i) the axial re-entrant down which the Poverty Canyon now incises; ii) the re-establishment of an accretionary wedge to the south of the indentation axis, accompanied by out-stepping, deformation front propagation into the trench fill sequence, particularly towards the mouth of the canyon; iii) the linear north margin of the indentation with respect to the more arcuate shape of the southern accretionary wedge; and, iv) the set of faults cutting obliquely across the deformation front near the mouth of the canyon. Many of the observed structural and geomorphic features of the Poverty Indentation also correlate well both with other sediment-rich convergent margins where seamount subduction is prevalent particularly the Nankai and Sumatra margins, and the sediment-starved Costa Rican margin. While submarine canyon systems are certainly present on other convergent margins undergoing seamount subduction there appears to be no other documented shelf to trench extending canyon system developing in the axis of such a re-entrant, as is dominating the Poverty Indentation. Ongoing modification of the Indentation appears to be driven by: i) continued smaller seamount impacts at the deformation front, and currently subducting beneath the mid-lower slope, ii) low and high sea-level stands accompanied by variations on sediment flux from the continental shelf, iii) over-steepening of the deformation front and mass movement, particularly from the shelf edge and upper slope...|$|R
