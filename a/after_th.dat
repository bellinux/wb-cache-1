5000|$|While {{mapping the}} {{so-called}} Sphinx for hidden passages or rooms, {{something happens to}} Rachel: all the instruments and equipment fail, and the Shrike appears in the Sphinx amidst a massive surge of [...] "anti-entropic fields". Rachel is returned to the WorldWeb where her parents learn of the novel disease she has contracted, dubbed the [...] "Merlin sickness" [...] (<b>after</b> <b>T.H.</b> White's The Once and Future King), in which every time Rachel goes to sleep, she ages backwards two days (for {{a net loss of}} one day per day), losing her memories and in fact physically becoming younger; there is no sign that the condition will reverse itself when she ages backwards to her birth. (However, she still needs to eat and breathe normally, she talks and acts normally while awake, and bruises from medical procedures one day are still present the next.) Rachel's life is shattered by her retrogression, slowly destroying her links with the present; her parents devote their lives to caring for Rachel and trying to cure her. A visit to the Shrike Temple on Lusus sees the bishop there cast out Sol, claiming Rachel doesn't need to be cured when she is the most blessed and cursed human in all of existence. After {{more than a decade of}} illness her story is picked up by the news media and Hyperion becomes a tourist destination. Meanwhile, Sol wrestles for years with his dreams in which he is ordered to go to Hyperion and sacrifice Rachel in a replay of the Binding of Isaac. Weintraub becomes increasingly fascinated with the ethical problem that the Binding presents. Shortly before his wife dies, Sol learns that she has been having the same dream word for word with the same faceted, glowing red eyes that match earlier descriptions of the Shrike's eyes. He also worries about what will happen when Rachel reaches her birthday (her actual age of zero days old which will be very soon), and so he decides to become a pilgrim and to implore the Shrike for a treatment.|$|E

40|$|Nanoporous anatase TiO 2 (np-TiO 2) {{electrodes}} {{have been}} developed via the anodization of titanium foils in fluoride containing electrolytes, and its application in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) was investigated. Four different types of np-TiO 2 electrodes with different pore diameters of 14. 7 +/- 8. 2 am, 12. 8 +/- 6. 8 nm, 11. 0 +/- 5. 5, and 26. 7 +/- 13. 6 nm were fabricated for evaluating the effect of nanoporous characteristics on the LIB performance. The discharge capacity of the four battery types 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 132. 7 mAh. g(- 1), 316. 7 mAh. g(- 1), 154. 3 mAh. g(- 1), and 228. 4 mAh. g(- 1), respectively. In addition, these electrodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 exhibited reversible capacity of 106. 9 mAh. g(- 1) <b>after</b> 295 <b>th,</b> 180. 9 mAh. g(- 1) <b>after</b> 220 <b>th,</b> 126. 1 mAh. g(- 1) <b>after</b> 150 <b>th,</b> and 206. 7 mAh. g(- 1) <b>after</b> 85 <b>th</b> cycle {{at a rate of}} 1 C, respectively. It was noted that the cyclic life of the batteries had an inverse relationship, and the capacity had a proportional relationship to the pore diameter.

40|$|AbstractPro-inflammatory {{cytokine}} release after shock {{is central}} {{in the development}} of subsequent multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Some studies suggest that interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) is an immunosuppressive mediator after injury or sepsis, while others suggest that IL- 10 is an important regulator of the pro-inflammatory response. We hypothesized that in a model of trauma and hemorrhagic shock (TH), IL- 10 regulates pro-inflammatory cytokine activity via an autocrine effect on cytokine mRNA transcription in Kupffer cells early <b>after</b> <b>TH.</b> To study this, male C 3 H/HeN mice were sham-operated or subjected to TH. Plasma levels of TNF-α, IL- 6 and PGE 2 were elevated following TH. A sharp peak in IL- 10 levels was observed at 2 h after the insult. Kupffer cell (KC) depletion prior to TH reduced plasma IL- 6, IL- 10 and TNF-α levels, whereas treatment with anti-IL- 10 <b>after</b> <b>TH</b> increased IL- 6 and TNF-α levels. Kupffer cell mRNA expression for IL- 6, IL- 10 and TNF-α was elevated in the TH group and further increased by anti-IL- 10 treatment. These findings indicate that KC-dependent IL- 10 regulates the early systemic inflammatory response <b>after</b> <b>TH.</b> Thus, while IL- 10 is an important mediator of immunosuppression following traumatic injury, it also is beneficial with regard to its ability to counter-regulate the early inflammatory response under such conditions...|$|E

40|$|In the {{national}} curriculum, The Knowledge Promotion 2006, the curriculum for Mathematics {{consists of the}} same core subjects from 1 st grade to level 1 in general studies (VG 1). It consists of four main subject areas and competence aims after 2 nd, 4 th, 7 th and 10 th grade. This means that the syllabus for upper secondary level 1 (VG 1) {{is based upon the}} competence aims <b>after</b> 10 <b>th</b> grade. As a teacher in Mathematics at the upper secondary level, I have observed that many pupils are not able to achieve what is expected from them, based on the competence aims <b>after</b> 10 <b>th</b> grade. I have observed this especially in the subject areas of algebra and functions. The aim of this master thesis is to find out how VG 1 pupils´ achievements in algebra and functions correspond with the competence aims <b>after</b> 10 <b>th</b> grade. What are the reasons for possible difficulties {{and what can be done}} to prevent the pupils´ difficulties within these subject areas. This resulted in these two problem statements: 1. How do the VG 1 pupils´ achievements in algebra and functions at the upper secondary in Sogndal correspond with LK 06 ´s competence aims <b>after</b> 10 <b>th</b> grade? 2. What are the reasons for the pupils' difficulties in algebra and functions, and what can be done to prevent them? To examine the first problem statement, I found valuable information in the results of the mapping test in Mathematics for pupils at the upper secondary school in Sogndal. I collected, systematised and analysed data from the mapping test for more than 330 pupils. The data covered many, but not all of the competence aims in algebra and functions <b>after</b> 10 <b>th</b> grade. That is the reason why the results will be presented with the belonging competence aim. The quantitative part of my examination indicates that VG 1 pupils´ achievements in algebra and functions do not correspond with the competence aims <b>after</b> 10 <b>th</b> grade in LK 06. To examine the second problem statement, I have examined prior researches and literature in the field. I have focused on what kind of misconceptions the pupils have in connection with algebra and functions. These misconceptions can arise in different levels and of various reasons, but they can be prevented if one is privy to what causes them, when teaching Mathematics. In this master thesis I examine the most common misconceptions in the subject of algebra and functions and how to prevent these. I will also discuss a few other possible reasons why the pupils are having difficulties within these subjects...|$|R
