5|$|In December 1942, Chetniks from Montenegro and Sandžak met at {{a conference}} in the village of Šahovići near Bijelo Polje. The conference was {{dominated}} by Montenegrin Serb Chetnik commander Major Pavle Đurišić and its resolutions expressed extremism <b>and</b> <b>intolerance,</b> as well as an agenda which focused on restoring the pre-war status quo in Yugoslavia implemented in its initial stages by a Chetnik dictatorship. It also laid claim to parts of the territory of Yugoslavia's neighbors. At this conference, Mihailović was represented by his chief of staff, Major Zaharije Ostojić, who had previously been encouraged by Mihailović to wage a campaign of terror against the Muslim population living along the borders of Montenegro and the Sandžak.|$|E
5|$|In their Bounty histories, both Hough and Alexander {{maintain}} that the men were not at a stage close to mutiny, however sorry they were to leave Tahiti. The journal of James Morrison, the boatswain's mate, supports this. The events that followed, Hough suggests, were determined in the three weeks following the departure, when Bligh's anger <b>and</b> <b>intolerance</b> reached paranoid proportions. Christian was a particular target, always seeming to {{bear the brunt of}} the captain's rages. Unaware of the effects of his behaviour on his officers and crew, Bligh would forget these displays instantly and attempt to resume normal conversation.|$|E

40|$|Various {{estimates}} put {{the number}} of people affected by food allergies <b>and</b> <b>intolerances</b> in Ireland in the tens of thousands. However, this is a complex area where actual data on the overall number of people affected, as well as the prevalence of the various types of food allergies <b>and</b> <b>intolerances</b> are not available. Figures estimated for Ireland are largely extrapolated from data available in other countries such as the UK. In order to get a general indication of the food allergies <b>and</b> <b>intolerances</b> most prevalent in Ireland, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) set up a web-based questionnaire asking five questions. Of the 509 people who responded over a six month time period in early 2010, the vast majority (85...|$|R
5|$|The initial {{symptoms}} of pituitary apoplexy {{are related to}} the increased pressure in and around the pituitary gland. The most common symptom, in over 95% of cases, is a sudden-onset headache located behind the eyes or around the temples. It is often associated with nausea and vomiting. Occasionally, the presence of blood leads to irritation of the lining of the brain, which may cause neck rigidity <b>and</b> <b>intolerance</b> to bright light, as well as a decreased level of consciousness. This occurs in 24% of cases.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} the book was written, Paraguay was under the {{dictatorship}} of Alfredo Stroessner, {{who went on to}} rule the country even longer than Francia did. Many consider the book to be at least in part a thinly disguised attack on Stroessner who used methods similar to Francia’s to achieve and maintain the effective control of the country, including the swift elimination of opposition, the employment of torture <b>and</b> <b>intolerance</b> of dissent. In its portrayal of Francia and criticism of Stroessner, I, the Supreme belongs to the genre of novelas de dictadores or dictator novels, and also to the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The book was first published in Spanish in 1974, and in English (translation by Helen Lane) in 1986.|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{as in the}} UK, the Hicklin test of {{obscenity}} applied, but New York {{case law}} had established that books should be judged by their effects on adults rather than on children and that literary merit was relevant. Ernst obtained statements from authors including Dreiser, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Sinclair Lewis, Sherwood Anderson, H. L. Mencken, Upton Sinclair, Ellen Glasgow and John Dos Passos. Besides, freedom of expression was protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. To make sure these supporters did not go unheard, he incorporated their opinions into his brief. His argument relied on a comparison with Mademoiselle de Maupin by Théophile Gautier, which had been cleared of obscenity in the 1922 case Halsey v. New York. Mademoiselle de Maupin described a lesbian relationship in more explicit terms than The Well did. According to Ernst, The Well had greater social value because it was more serious in tone and made a case against misunderstanding <b>and</b> <b>intolerance.</b>|$|E

40|$|Food allergies <b>and</b> <b>intolerances</b> are {{examples}} of adverse food reactions and describe adverse reactions to foods. Regardless of whether classified as either an allergy or intolerance, dietary management should be handled by a qualified dietitian/nutritionist (in conjunction with an allergist {{in the case of}} food allergies), since self imposed restrictions may lead to nutritional deficiencies. The area of food allergies <b>and</b> <b>intolerances</b> is not at all clear-cut. Accurate diagnosis is essential, and this usually requires a referral from a General Practitioner to an Allergist. Understanding food allergies <b>and</b> <b>intolerances</b> This section is kindly adapted from Friendly Food, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Allergy Unit. Understanding the difference between <b>intolerance</b> <b>and</b> other types of food reaction is an important starting point because the approach to dealing with them is quite different. Unlike allergies and coeliac disease, which are immune reactions to food proteins, intolerances don’t involve the immune system at all. They are triggered by food chemicals which cause reactions by irritating nerve endings {{in different parts of the}} body, rather in the way that certain drugs can cause sideeffects in sensitive people (2). The chemicals involved in food intolerances are found in many different foods, so the approac...|$|R

We have conducted a survey, which {{has not yet been}} published, with the aim of comparing the clinical features of patients with bronchial asthma and those with analgesic intolerance accompanying asthma.

Individuals are also unlikely to associate foods causing problems because of masking or where separation of time between eating and symptoms occur. The elimination process can overcome addiction and unmask problem foods so that the patients can associate cause and effect.|$|E
