5|$|By June, {{the mayor}} was looking for {{political}} support to avert a full public inquiry. The National Party, whose members were dominant on the Council, and MLC Melinda Pavey had been particularly critical {{of the actions of}} the Department of Local Government in the General Purpose Standing Committee. Local independent MP, Rob Oakeshott said, however, that the Council should instead address the findings of the report, and stop arguing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> or using emotional arguments in support of it. He also cautioned against getting politicians involved, stressing that this was a formal legal process.|$|E
5|$|Some argue on {{religious}} or philosophical {{grounds that it}} is blameworthy to act against conscience, even if the judgement of conscience {{is likely to be}} erroneous (say because it is inadequately informed <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts,</b> or prevailing moral (humanist or religious), professional ethical, legal and human rights norms). Failure to acknowledge and accept that conscientious judgements can be seriously mistaken, may only promote situations where one's conscience is manipulated by others to provide unwarranted justifications for non-virtuous and selfish acts; indeed, insofar as it is appealed to as glorifying ideological content, and an associated extreme level of devotion, without adequate constraint of external, altruistic, normative justification, conscience may be considered morally blind and dangerous both to the individual concerned and humanity as a whole. Langston argues that philosophers of virtue ethics have unnecessarily neglected conscience for, once conscience is trained so that the principles and rules it applies are those one would want all others to live by, its practise cultivates and sustains the virtues; indeed, amongst people in what each society considers to be the highest state of moral development there is little disagreement about how to act.Emmanuel Levinas viewed conscience as a revelatory encountering of resistance to our selfish powers, developing morality by calling into question our naive sense of freedom of will to use such powers arbitrarily, or with violence, this process being more severe the more rigorously the goal of our self was to obtain control.|$|E

25|$|The {{trial was}} criticised in Israel {{as a show}} trial, {{although}} strict Israeli military censorship of the press, at the time, meant that the Israeli public was {{kept in the dark}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of the case and, in fact, were led to believe that the defendants were innocent. There were allegations that evidence had been extracted by torture.|$|E
25|$|Hema also criticised {{the media}} and the public, which {{pronounced}} the verdict knowing very little <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of the case, including the 24 volumes of case diary, the medical reports and the statements from the doctors. Hema also mentioned the accusations propagated by the media, public and the CBI against officers of the local police and crime branch without any incriminating evidence.|$|E
25|$|On 15 April 1989 at an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, 96 Liverpool {{fans were}} crushed to death after the {{terraces}} at the Leppings Lane {{end of the}} ground became overcrowded, in {{what became known as}} the Hillsborough disaster. The following report concluded that the root cause of the disaster was the failure of local police to adequately manage the crowds. A memorial to the victims of the disaster stands outside Hillsborough's South Stand, near the main entrance on Parkside Road. After many years of dispute <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts,</b> in June 2017 six men responsible for safety were charged with criminal offences including manslaughter and misconduct in public office.|$|E

25|$|In a video titled “The Truth About the West Bank” {{released}} by the Israeli foreign ministry in June 2011, Ayalon presents a historical narrative meant to help wage the public diplomacy battle about Israel’s ongoing conflict with the Palestinians. In the video made in cooperation with StandWithUs, which {{is very similar to}} one released earlier by the Yesha council, the organization of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Ayalon asks viewers to stop referring to the West Bank as “occupied territories”. “It is time for Israel to return to a ‘rights-based diplomacy’ and talk <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts,</b> rights, history and international law which are little known but give a dramatically different viewpoint to what is currently accepted,” he said after the video’s release. After the video was posted online, Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian Authority’s top negotiator, denounced the video as a “falsified account of history and international law”, but refused to participate in a public debate on the issues raised in the video proposed by Ayalon.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of August 14, 2016, Lochte and Jimmy Feigen said that they and {{teammates}} Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger were robbed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during the 2016 Summer Olympics after men forced {{them out of their}} taxi at gunpoint in the early morning hours. After surveillance video and a police report emerged that confirmed a security guard had brandished a gun after {{one or more of the}} athletes vandalized the gas station bathroom, Lochte stated in an interview that he had been drunk and that he [...] "over-exaggerated that story". However his amended story raised concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts,</b> and soon it emerged that Lochte's taxi had not in fact been stopped by armed men, but that the swimmers had stopped to use the fuel station's bathroom which Lochte was accused of vandalizing. He initially claimed that money was taken from him, but it was later clarified the money was offered as repayment for the alleged vandalism.|$|E
500|$|Most visibly {{during the}} 2012 term, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Sotomayor {{was part of}} a {{landmark}} 5–4 majority that upheld most of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (while being part of a dissent against the reliance upon the Constitution's Taxing and Spending Clause rather than Commerce Clause in arriving at the support). Legal writer Jeffrey Toobin wrote, [...] "Sotomayor's concerns tended toward the earthbound and practical. Sometimes, during oral arguments, she would go on tangents involving detailed questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of cases that would leave her colleagues stupefied, sinking into their chairs. This time, though, she had a simple line of inquiry. States require individuals to buy automobile insurance (implicitly suggesting the unavoidable comparison to health insurance and the fairness of the applying the same principle to health insurance as well)." [...] Sotomayor concluded with the incisive rhetorical flourish in the Court directed at the attorneys: [...] "Do you think that if some states decided not to impose an insurance requirement that the federal government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insurance?" [...] For Toobin, this distinction drawn by Sotomayor was the heart of the argument for the case in which she was part of the prevailing majority opinion.|$|E

2500|$|Critical thinking: Consists of {{a mental}} process of [...] or {{evaluating}} information, particularly statements or propositions that people have offered as true. It forms a process of reflecting upon the meaning of statements, examining the offered evidence and reasoning, and forming judgments <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts.</b> Critical thinkers can gather such information from observation, experience, reasoning, and/or communication. Critical thinking has its basis in intellectual values that go beyond subject-matter divisions and which include: clarity, accuracy, precision, evidence, thoroughness and fairness.|$|E
2500|$|Capra's screenplays {{called for}} two {{principal}} characters, [...] "Dr. Research" [...] and [...] "Mr. Fiction Writer", who would interact both {{with each other}} and with animated characters specific to each film. Dr. Research mainly explains scientific matters. Matthew Gunter adds that the Fiction Writer [...] "possesses many of the characteristics of the heroes in earlier Capra films. ... Mr. Writer also acts like the audience's surrogate, often expressing a healthy skepticism or disbelief <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> Dr. Research presents, asking questions to the scientist, and translating his technical verbiage into the language of the common people." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Europe, as John Ruskin said, and Sir Kenneth Clark confirmed, {{landscape}} painting was the [...] "chief artistic {{creation of the}} nineteenth century", and [...] "the dominant art", {{with the result that}} in the following period people were [...] "apt to assume that the appreciation of natural beauty and the painting of landscape is a normal and enduring part of our spiritual activity" [...] In Clark's analysis, underlying European ways to convert the complexity of landscape to an idea were four fundamental approaches: the acceptance of descriptive symbols, a curiosity <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of nature, the creation of fantasy to allay deep-rooted fears of nature, and the belief in a Golden Age of harmony and order, which might be retrieved.|$|E

60|$|If so, I {{answer that}} it is only the {{theories}} or speculations of scientific investigators about which variety of opinion is immaterial, not the essential principles of the science; and that we cannot exclude all questions of doctrine from among those principles.

6000|$|All {{that was}} right or wrong in Kipling was {{expressed}} in the final convulsion that he almost in person managed to achieve. The nearest that any honest man {{can come to the}} thing called [...] "impartiality" [...] is to confess that he is partial. I therefore confess that I think this last turn of the Victorian Age was an unfortunate turn; much on the other side can be said, and I hope will be said. But <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> there can be no question. The Imperialism of Kipling was equally remote from the Victorian caution and the Victorian idealism: and our subject does quite seriously end here. The world was full of the trampling of totally new forces, gold was sighted from far in a sort of cynical romanticism: the guns opened across Africa; and the great queen died.|$|E
60|$|The Durham Light Infantry {{carried the}} hill {{at the point}} of the bayonet, losing seven {{officers}} and sixty or seventy men, and capturing five Boer prisoners, besides ten horses and some wounded, Most of the enemy, however, had retired before the attack, unable to endure the appalling concentration of artillery which had prepared it. Among those who remained to fight to the last were five or six armed Kaffirs, one of whom shot an officer of the Durhams. To these no quarter was given. Their employment by the Dutch in this war shows that while they furiously complain of Khama's defence of his territory against their raiding parties on the ground that white men must be killed by white men, they have themselves no such scruples. There is no possible doubt <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> set forth above, and the incident should be carefully noted by the public.|$|E
