5|$|Plutonium is a {{reactive}} metal. In {{moist air}} or moist argon, the metal oxidizes rapidly, producing {{a mixture of}} oxides and hydrides. If the metal is exposed long enough to <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of water vapor, a powdery surface coating of PuO2 is formed. Also formed is plutonium hydride but an excess of water vapor forms only PuO2.|$|E
5|$|Showdown: (Stylized as Sh0wdown) A mode {{added in}} a later update. In this mode, 2 teams of 2 players battle each other in short missions. Missions vary from {{the first team to}} steal 3 hard drives to the {{offensive}} team having to hack the servers the defensive team is protecting in <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of time.|$|E
5|$|The lane is a {{restricted}} {{area in which}} players can stay for only <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of time.

30|$|During {{prolonged}} {{activities at}} high-intensity exercises, {{the main energy source}} is CHO {{derived from the}} muscle and liver glycogen [26]. However, since the body can only store <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>amounts</b> of this metabolic substrate (up to 600  g), prolonged high-intensity physical activity above FATmin could lead to depletion of glycogen stores, therefore making FATmin an important parameter to consider when exercising at high-intensity for long periods of time.|$|R
40|$|The {{regulation}} of lysA which encodes the last enzyme for lysine biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, diaminopimelic acid-decarboxylase, was studied by using lysA-lacZ fusions. Our results indicate an absolute {{requirement for the}} LysR product for its activation, LysR protein present in <b>a</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>amount</b> which can be titrated by a multicopy plasmid carrying its target site and a negative regulatory role for the LysA protein itself which decreases lysA-lacZ expression 30 -fold...|$|R
5|$|A reoccurring {{theme in}} legend and folktale {{consists}} of a man or, more often, {{a woman who is}} challenged to gain as much land as can be traveled within <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of time. This motif is attested by Livy around 1 CE, 5th century BCE Greek historian Herodotus, and in folktales from Northern Europe. In six tales from Jutland, Denmark and one from Germany a plough is used similarly as in Livy's account, though the conditions are often met by walking or riding.|$|E
5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{and other}} facultative anaerobes {{constitute}} about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecal–oral transmission {{is the major}} route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease. Cells are able to survive outside the body for <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of time, which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination. A growing body of research, though, has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for extended periods outside a host.|$|E
40|$|Protonation of [RuH(Cl) (PPh 3) (2) (NBD) ] (NBD = norbornadiene) in benzene with <b>a</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>amount</b> of HOTf gives [RuH(OTf) (PPh 3) (2) (NBD) ], norbornene, and [RuCl 2 (PPh 3) (2) ](2). In dichloromethane, [RuH(Cl) (PPh 3) (2) (NBD) ] {{reacts with}} <b>a</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>amount</b> of HOTf to give [RuH(OTf) (PPh 3) (2) (NBD) ], norbornene, and the trimetallic complex [Ru 3 Cl 5 (PPh 3) (6) ]OTf. In contrast, {{protonation}} of [OsH(Cl) (PPh 3) (2) (NBD) ] in benzene or dichloromethane with limiting HOTf only gives [OsH(OTf) (PPh 3) (2) (NBD) ]. In the protonation of [RuH(Cl) (PPh 3) (2) (NBD) ], the norbornene is likely produced through the intermediate [RuH(HCl) (PPh 3) (2) (NBD) ]OTf. The involvement of [RuH(HCl) (PPh 3) (2) (NBD) ](+) {{in the formation}} of norbornene is supported by theoretical calculations based on the B 3 LYP density functional theory. The fact that norbornene is not produced in the protonation of [OsH(Cl) (PPh 3) (2) (NBD) ] {{can be attributed to the}} stronger osmium-olefin interaction...|$|R

5|$|The first {{published}} reports of A-DNA X-ray diffraction patterns—and also B-DNA—used analyses based on Patterson transforms that provided only <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of structural information for oriented fibers of DNA. An alternative analysis was then proposed by Wilkins et al., in 1953, for the in vivo B-DNA X-ray diffraction-scattering patterns of highly hydrated DNA fibers {{in terms of}} squares of Bessel functions. In the same journal, James Watson and Francis Crick presented their molecular modeling analysis of the DNA X-ray diffraction patterns {{to suggest that the}} structure was a double-helix.|$|E

5000|$|Asymmetric PCR {{preferentially}} amplifies one {{strand of}} the target DNA. It is used in some sequencing methods and hybridization probing, to generate one DNA strand as product. Thermocycling is carried out as in PCR, but with <b>a</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>amount</b> or leaving {{out one of the}} primers. When the limiting primer becomes depleted, replication increases arithmetically through extension of the excess primer. [...] A modification of this process, named Linear-After-The-Exponential-PCR (or LATE-PCR), uses <b>a</b> <b>limiting</b> primer with <b>a</b> higher Melting temperature (Tm) than the excess primer to maintain reaction efficiency as the limiting primer concentration decreases mid-reaction.

5|$|Although {{the player}} can use {{firearms}} to kill monsters, Resident Evil emphasizes evasion over fast-paced combat {{by providing the}} player with limited ammunition. The player has <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of health which decreases when attacked by monsters. Nevertheless, players can regain their health by collecting and using herbs, which can be mixed with other herbs to increase their healing effect. Some monsters can also infect the player with a poisoning effect, which gradually depletes the player's health over time until the poison is cured with serum or special herbs. Zombies that are defeated but not decapitated or burned eventually revive and mutate into much deadlier opponents.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone John {{extensively}} {{affected areas}} of Western Australia, but damage {{was not as}} bad as expected. Widespread power outages across the Pilbara region were caused by John. Strong winds caused minor damage to infrastructure across the coast, as well as tree damage. 140windmills were destroyed by the cyclone on the coast. Further inland, rainfall associated with the cyclone and its remnants brought flooding, which flooded 25houses and caused rivers to overflow. The system was responsible for no deaths and <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of damage. After the season, the name John was retired from the Australian tropical cyclone naming list.|$|E

5|$|Gaelic football, hurling and {{handball}} are {{the best-known}} of the Irish traditional sports, collectively known as Gaelic games. Gaelic games {{are governed by}} the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), {{with the exception of}} ladies' Gaelic football and camogie (women's variant of hurling), which are governed by separate organisations. The headquarters of the GAA (and the main stadium) is located at the 82,500 capacity Croke Park in north Dublin. Many major GAA games are played there, including the semi-finals and finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. During the redevelopment of the Lansdowne Road stadium in 2007–10, international rugby and soccer were played there.

5|$|Galileo made {{original}} {{contributions to}} the science of motion through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics. More typical of science {{at the time were}} the qualitative studies of William Gilbert, on magnetism and electricity. Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, a lutenist and music theorist, had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear relation in physics: for a stretched string, the pitch varies as the square root of the tension. These observations lay {{within the framework of the}} Pythagorean tradition of music, well-known to instrument makers, which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale. Thus, <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of mathematics had long related music and physical science, and young Galileo could see his own father's observations expand on that tradition.|$|E

5|$|In {{neighboring}} {{areas of}} Russia {{there are significant}} numbers of Norway spruce, but they only exist sporadically within Øvre Pasvik, {{with no more than}} 40 trees in one place. The lack of spruce is caused by a combination of frost occurring as late as June, and wildfire. There is also <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of birch, specifically dwarf birch and silver birch. Aspen is uncommon largely because its bark and roots are popular food for animals. Along some creeks there are bird cherry and grey alder. The area is too dry to allow the latter to grow away from creeks and lake sides. There are eight to ten species of willow within the national park.|$|E
5|$|RNA splicing, {{carried out}} by a complex called the spliceosome, is {{the process by which}} introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the {{remaining}} exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibodies, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences. This process is known as alternative splicing, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of DNA.|$|E
