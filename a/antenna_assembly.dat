2500|$|In 2011, {{a decade}} long upgrade project had {{resulted}} in the VLA expanding its technical capacities by factors {{of as much as}} 8,000. The 1970s era electronics were replaced with state-of-the-art equipment. To reflect this increased capacity, VLA officials asked for input from both the scientific community and the public in coming up with a new name for the array, and in January 2012 it was announced that the array would be renamed the [...] "Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array". On March 31, 2012, the VLA was officially renamed in a ceremony inside the <b>Antenna</b> <b>Assembly</b> Building.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{processes}} used to fabricate and load test the NASA Scatterometer <b>Antenna</b> <b>Assemblies.</b> The fabrication processes include layup, curing and machining of antenna components, and the bonding and assembly of the components into the final antenna configuration. The design of each antenna consists of an aluminum waveguide bonded to a sandwich structure of Nomex honeycomb core with graphite/epoxy skins. A titanium end fitting with fiberglass/epoxy transitions is bonded into one end of each antenna. Several antenna components are fabricated using a process where aluminum foil is co-cured to a composite surface. The <b>antenna</b> <b>assemblies</b> are radiographically inspected, thermally cycled, and load tested prior to shipment...|$|R

2500|$|Identification of Trains and Routing Automatically (IDENTRA) was {{implemented}} {{on the line}} in the 1957 and used until 1997, when a route selector punch box with B1 Astoria, local/express buttons was installed at the 10/11 car marker on the upper level of Queensboro Plaza. IDENTRA used a removable round circular disc type radio <b>antenna</b> <b>assembly,</b> slide-mounted on the small mounting brackets that were attached on the front of R12, R14, R15, and R17 cars that were assigned to the 7 route, which had been used on the line since 1948. Similar to the use of radio transponders in the CBTC installation, the system used the antennas to determine whether a train was running local or express, and then accordingly switched the track at interlockings near the Queensboro Plaza and Flushing–Main Street stations. This move reduced the number of signal towers on the line from 9 to 2 and allowed to operate 37 eleven-car trains instead of only 30 nine-car trains per hour. The consolidated signal system was in use by 1956 while the selector system was in service by 1958. This system, still in use by many transit agencies such as SEPTA's Broad Street Line, is also nicknamed the [...] "toilet seat" [...] because the removable disc antenna is shaped like a toilet seat.|$|E

40|$|This short review {{describes}} how solid-state NMR {{has provided a}} mechanistic and electronic picture of pigment–protein and pigment–pigment interactions in photosynthetic antenna complexes. NMR results on purple bacterial antenna complexes show how the packing of the protein and the pigments inside the light-harvesting oligomers induces mutual conformational stress. The protein scaffold produces deformation and electrostatic polarization of the BChl macrocycles and leads to a partial electronic charge transfer between the BChls and their coordinating histidines, which can tune the light-harvesting function. In chlorosome <b>antennae</b> <b>assemblies,</b> the NMR template structure reveals how the chromophores can direct their self-assembly into higher macrostructures which, in turn, tune the light-harvesting properties of the individual molecules by controlling their disorder, structural deformation, and electronic polarization {{without the need for}} a protein scaffold. These results pave the way for addressing the next challenge, which is to resolve the functional conformational dynamics of the lhc antennae of oxygenic species that allows them to switch between light-emitting and light-energy dissipating states...|$|R
40|$|The ORBCOMM Flight Model (FM) 12 ̆ 62 and MicroLab I {{spacecraft}} were flawlessly {{launched by}} a Pegasus® vehicle on April 3, 1995. Following sequential {{separation from the}} Pegasus third stage, the spacecraft deployed solar arrays and <b>antenna</b> <b>assemblies,</b> autonomously de-tumbled, and acquired sun-nadir attitude. Both ORBCOMM spacecraft connected automatically with a Gateway Earth Station (GES) about 8 hours after launch. Nominal early passes focused on post-launch housekeeping tasks. However, a series of anomalies developed: including loss of gateway uplink, gateway downlink transmitter oscillation, poor GPS position fixing, subscriber downlink transmitter lock-up, and several software problems. All these conditions were unique to the space environment or resulted from minor design changes or oversights. Eventually the spacecraft were recovered from their outages and the causes conclusively determined. Throughout this time, the spacecraft housekeeping subsystems continued to function nominally {{with a high degree}} of autonomy. Following maneuvers and testing, the satellites were delivered to ORBCOMM Global on August 3, 1995...|$|R
