5|$|By mid 1945, the {{economic}} drain on Britain {{due to her}} sustained war effort was becoming critical, and a new proposal, with an armour arrangement similar to the modernized HMS Renown, christened 'Design X', was submitted by a design committee headed by Admiral Servaes to the DNC. 'Design X', along with the earlier preferred 'B3' variant Battleship design were further refined through October 1945, when further design work was informally suspended on all but the new Mk III 16 inch turret. This work too was finally cancelled by the First Sea Lord in late 1949 <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> final end to battleship design and construction for the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Æthelberht was converted to Christianity before Augustine's arrival. Æthelberht's wife was a Christian <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> Frankish bishop with her, to attend her at court, so Æthelberht would have had knowledge of Christianity before the mission reached Kent. It also {{is possible}} that Bede had the date of Æthelberht's death wrong; if, in fact, Æthelberht died in 618, this {{would be consistent with}} his baptism in 597, which is in accord with the tradition that Augustine converted the king within a year of his arrival.|$|E

5|$|The NS-10 {{displaced}} the Auratone 5C Sound Cube as the nearfield monitor {{of choice}} in the 1980s and was recognised {{for its ability to}} reveal shortcomings in recordings. It probably first reached American shores through a recording engineer's visit to Japan. The engineer, likely to have been Greg Ladanyi, monitored a recording session through the speaker in a Japanese studio <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> pair back on his return to the US. Ladanyi then began using the speakers in a Los Angeles studio. Other engineers heard the NS-10 {{for the first time and}} were impressed by its sound. Its use spread to New York where the NS-10 was adopted at The Power Station and other studios.|$|E

5|$|Charles VII {{spent most}} of his three-year reign as emperor {{residing}} in Frankfurt while Maria Theresa battled Prussia for her patrimony in Bohemia and Hungary. Frederick could not secure Bohemia for Charles, but he did manage to push the Austrians out of Bavaria. For the last three months of his short reign, the gout-ridden Charles lived in Munich, where he died in January 1745. His son, Maximilian III Joseph (known as Max Joseph) inherited his father's electoral dignities but not his imperial ambition. With the Peace of Füssen (22 April 1745), Max Joseph promised to vote for Francis of Lorraine, Maria Theresa's husband, in the pending imperial election. He also acknowledged the Pragmatic Sanction. In return, he obtained the restitution of his family's electoral position and territories. For his subjects, his negotiations ended five years of warfare <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> generation of peace and relative prosperity that began with his father's death in 1745 and ended with his own in 1777.|$|E

5|$|In 1848, {{at the age}} of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was {{admitted}} to the Paris Conservatoire, France's foremost music academy. The director, Daniel Auber, had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative. Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist. His organ professor was François Benoist, whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam, César Franck, Charles Alkan, Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet. In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies. His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet.|$|E
5|$|Jesus Anaya {{became the}} first National Light Heavyweight Champion {{when he won the}} inaugural tournament that {{concluded}} on the EMLL 9th Anniversary Show, defeating Black Guzmán. Empresa Mexicana de Luch Libre was the primary promotion to use the championship in subsequent years, although did not have exclusive control of the championship. In 1992 then-CMLL booker Antonio Peña left the company to create AAA <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> number of CMLL wrestlers with him, including among others the then-reigning Mexican National Light Heavyweight Champion Máscara Sagrada. The commission allowed Máscara Sagrada to take the championship with him to AAA.

In December 2007 Místico won the title from Vangelis, making it an official CMLL recognized championship from that point forward.|$|E

Other writers include three acclaimed crime fiction writers from outside of Baltimore: George Pelecanos from Washington, Richard Price from the Bronx and Dennis Lehane from Boston. Reviewers drew comparisons between Price's works (particularly Clockers) and The Wire even before he joined. In addition to writing, Pelecanos served as a producer for the third season. Pelecanos has commented that he was attracted to the project because {{of the opportunity to}} work with Simon. Staff writer Rafael Alvarez penned several episodes' scripts, as well as the series guidebook The Wire: Truth Be Told. Alvarez is a colleague of Simon's from The Baltimore Sun and a Baltimore native with working experience in the port area.
