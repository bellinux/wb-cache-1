5|$|Administration and {{religion}} were closely linked {{in the system}} of the Celestial Masters. Adherents were grouped by families, and each was attached to a district.

Any changes to those registered had to be accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>monetary</b> contribution known as a 'wage of faith.' Requests to the gods followed a bureaucratic model, and were drawn up according to specific administrative codes.

5|$|During the Han Dynasty, silk became {{progressively}} more valuable {{in its own}} right, and became more than simply a material.

The wealth that silk brought to China stirred envy in neighboring peoples. Beginning in the 2nd century BCE, the Xiongnu regularly pillaged the provinces of the Han Chinese for around 250 years.
