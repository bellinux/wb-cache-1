500|$|As a batsman, Leyland {{generally}} {{batted in}} the middle order or occasionally opened the batting. Early in his career, commentators suggested that his batting technique was faulty, {{even when he was}} statistically successful. His use of the cut shot was mistrusted by some Yorkshire critics, and they suspected that his preference for attacking play would be unsuccessful; he was a faster scorer and more aggressive batsman than most of his Yorkshire contemporaries. Cardus suggested that, instead, he was in the line of [...] "humorous Yorkshiremen which the broad nature of his county produces from time to time as a contrast to and leavening of the generally dour lump. There was <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eye and there was <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bat, no matter how grimly and straight it may occasionally be obliged to defend a difficult situation in Yorkshire." [...] The cricket writer E. W. Swanton observed that Leyland's bat was often not straight when he played his shots—contrary to orthodox technique—but the speed of his footwork and his ability to watch the ball closely made up for any lapses. Opposing bowlers suggested that the impression was an illusion and that his bat was straight when he hit the ball.|$|E
500|$|King Edward died in 1910, and the First World War began {{four years}} after his death. Helena devoted her time to nursing, and her daughter, Princess Marie Louise, {{recorded}} in her memoirs that requests for news of loved ones reached Helena and her sisters. It was decided that the letters should be forwarded to Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, as Sweden was neutral during the war. It was during the war that Helena and Christian celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in 1916, {{and despite the fact}} that Britain and Germany were at war, the Kaiser sent a congratulatory telegram to his aunt and uncle through the Crown Princess of Sweden. King George V and Queen Mary were present when the telegram was received, and the King remarked to Helena's daughter, Marie Louise, that her former husband, Prince Aribert of Anhalt, did her a service when he turned her out. When Marie Louise said she would have run away to Britain if she was still married, the King said, [...] "with <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eye", that he would have had to intern her.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 August 1942 Winston Churchill {{saw her in}} Stalin's private {{apartments in}} the Kremlin, {{describing}} her as [...] "a handsome red-haired girl, who kissed her father dutifully." [...] Churchill says Stalin [...] "looked at me with <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eye as if, so I thought, to convey 'You see, even we Bolsheviks have a family life.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The BBC often {{played down}} his {{comments}} as ultimately {{not having the}} weight they were ascribed. In 2007 they described Clarkson as [...] "Not a man given to considered opinion", {{and in response to}} an official complaint another BBC spokeswoman once said: [...] "Jeremy's colourful comments are always entertaining, but they are his own comments and not those of the BBC. More often than not they are said with <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eye." ...|$|E
2500|$|Orson Welles was so {{impressed}} by McGoohan's stage presence ("intimidated," [...] Welles would later say) that he cast him as Starbuck in his York theatre production of Moby Dick—Rehearsed. Welles said in 1969 that he believed McGoohan [...] "would now be, I think, {{one of the big}} actors of our generation if TV hadn't grabbed him. He can still make it. He was tremendous as Starbuck." [...] and [...] "with all the required attributes, looks, intensity, unquestionable acting ability and <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eye." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite his pacifist upbringing, {{as a young}} freedom fighter, Wali Khan seemed exasperated {{with the}} pacifism {{advocated}} by his father. He was to later explain his frustration to Gandhi, in a story he told Muklaika Bannerjee, [...] "If the cook comes to slaughter this chicken's baby, is non-violence {{on the part of}} the chicken likely to save the younger life?" [...] The story ended with <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eye when he remembered Gandhiji's reply, [...] "Wali, you seem to have done more research on violence than I have on non-violence." [...] His first wife died in 1949 while Wali Khan was in prison. In 1954, he married Nasim Wali Khan, the daughter of an old Khudai Khidmatgar activist.|$|E

2500|$|Erickson was an irrepressible {{practical}} joker, {{and it was}} {{not uncommon}} for him to slip indirect suggestions into all kinds of situations, including in his own books, papers, lectures and seminars. For example, a student arrived at one of the five-day intensive seminars he held in his home office {{near the end of his}} life. When Erickson asked why she had come, she replied frankly: [...] "My teacher told me that I should come to see you before you died." [...] Erickson smiled and said: [...] "You tell him that dying is the last thing I intend to do." [...] The group laughed at the pun. Then Erickson said, with <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eye, [...] "Do you want to know how to avoid dying? Always wake up every morning. And do you want to know how to ensure that you will wake up every morning?", he continued, [...] "Drink lots of liquids before you go to sleep!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... “There were a {{great many}} cowboys with the show. [...] There was a chief of the cowboys who had general {{supervision}} over both horses and men. [...] When an unbroken horse would be brought in, this cowboy chief would give it to an Indian to ride bareback. [...] After the animal was well broken, it would {{be taken away from}} the Indian and given to a cowboy to ride. [...] Then the Indian would be given another unbroken horse. [...] For a while we said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came to me just before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] I asked him what was the matter, and {{he said it was a}} wild horse and he was not going to ride it into the arena. [...] I went to the chief cowboy and said, ‘I do not think you are doing right. [...] You know our Indian boys have to ride bareback, but you always give them the wild horses to ride. [...] Then, when they have the horse nicely broken, you give to a cowboy. [...] Why don’t you give the wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by a little thing like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You know very well that Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know that you give the wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was ready to go back to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had <b>a</b> <b>twinkle</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses. [...] Although Buffalo Bill never said anything to me, I knew he had fixed things to our satisfaction.” ...|$|E
