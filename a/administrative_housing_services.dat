40|$|The ongoing {{crisis in}} the <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> and public {{utilities}} sphere determines the need to accelerate its integration into the market space. The author proposes to apply the cluster initiatives, which, in his opinion, provide the solution of <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> and public utilities problems {{in terms of their}} broader vision. This paper attempts to highlight the benefits of the cluster approach to the development of <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> and public utilities, and identifies the main provisions in the process of its implementation. The essence of the concept of «housing services and social cluster of the region» in terms of <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> and public utilities development is revealed, members of cluster unification are designated, its components are identified, the purpose of introducing the cluster model of <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> and public utilities reform management is determined, which essence is to change the mentality of the producers and consumers of <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> and public utilities in the direction of increasing responsibilities and respect for mutual interests in the market of <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> and public utilities. The main provisions and principles of formation of <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> and social cluster of the region are reviewed, as well as the characteristics and trends of its development. An authorial approach {{to the development of a}} strategy of forming a <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> and social cluster in the region in accordance with modern trends is presented. The leading role of several factors in establishing the basic prerequisites for sustainable operation of <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> and social cluster of the region is justified. These factors include governmental regulation of pricing and forms of support to small entrepreneurship development, creation of financial security system, development of public-private partnerships and implementation of innovative technologies. The role of non-governmental organizations and public associations in the formation of <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> and social cluster in the region is substantiated; its competitive abilities and under-developed competitive advantages are shown...|$|R

40|$|Background and aims: Since de-institutionalisation, <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> {{have taken}} {{a central role in}} the care of {{patients}} with severe mental illness. Yet, little is known about the characteristics of patients in different <b>housing</b> <b>services,</b> what care they receive, and what costs are generated. This study aimed to assess patient characteristics, care provision and costs in different types of <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> in England. Methods: In 12 representative local areas in England, 250 <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> were randomly selected. Information on services, characteristics of randomly selected patients and care received were obtained from managers. Results: Data from 153 services (61 % response rate) and 414 patients were analysed. Most patients receive support with activities of daily living and are involved in some sort of occupational activities. 52 % have a care co-ordinator in a community mental health team. Care provision and costs differed significantly between care homes, supported <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> and floating support services. Conclusions: Quality standards may have to be defined and applied to ensure that all patients in <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> receive appropriate care. More input of mental health services may be required for the rehabilitation and recovery of patients...|$|R

40|$|House price indexes {{summarize}} {{the development of}} all house prices in a single number, while actual price movements often differ among market segments. We develop a methodology for measuring house prices as a flexible function of <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> – a one-dimensional quality measure – {{and apply it to}} test for the common assumption of identical price movements {{in all parts of the}} housing market. Our approach is based on a generalization of the familiar (constant unit price) Muth model to a situation of in which the unit price of <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> may depend on the quality level. We apply the method to a rich set of transaction data referring to Amsterdam in the period 1985 - 2013. We estimate an indicator of <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> based only on the ranking of house prices in postcode areas during periods of three months and compare the results to conventional hedonic price equations that embody the assumption of a unit price for <b>housing</b> <b>services</b> that does not depend on quality.
