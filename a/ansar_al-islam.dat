5|$|Unprecedented {{security}} measures {{were made by}} the Turkish government to safeguard the NATO summit from terrorist attacks. They especially feared a repetition of the Istanbul bombings of 2003 that killed more than 60 people. Their fear was proven by the arrest of 16 people in Bursa in early May on suspicion of planning to bomb the summit. Police seized guns, explosives, bomb-making booklets and 4,000 compact discs with training advice from Osama Bin Laden, and believed that the suspects were members of the radical Islamic group <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam,</b> thought to be linked with al-Qaeda. On June 24 two bombs also exploded. One bomb went off in a bus in Istanbul killing 4 people (including the bomber), the other outside a hotel in Ankara where US president George W. Bush would be staying. Additionally, on June 25, explosives were found in a parked car at Istanbul's main airport.|$|E
5|$|The next day, American forces {{advanced}} to Kirkuk during Operation Option North, hoping to control oil fields and military airfields {{in and around}} the city. Controlling the oil fields had been a specific operational goal of the Task Force because they were viewed as the most valuable strategic asset in northern Iraq. Between 30 March and 2 April, the 173d Airborne Brigade, along with the Special Forces detachment and the Kurdish forces, engaged and destroyed the 2nd, 4th, 8th and 38th Iraqi Infantry divisions as well as a force loyal to <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam.</b> The brigade used field artillery assets, as well as coordinated airstrikes to attack Iraqi Republican Guard units defending the city. Within a week these units began to fall apart due to desertions. On 10 April the brigade was able to move into the city, securing it after a short urban battle. The entire battle for Kirkuk cost the brigade only nine casualties. During the operation, some of the troops discovered at least two caches of Iraqi gold, totaling more than 2,000 bars. The unit then took part in Operation Peninsula Strike, quelling Ba'ath party resistance and other insurgent groups. These operations, though successful, would have been more effective if the 4th Infantry Division's four heavy brigades were able to enter Iraq through Turkey as originally planned. 4th ID had to relocate their forces from Turkey to Kuwait and were subsequently slowed down in Baghdad. VCorps was not able to surround Baghdad as quickly as it had hoped {{because of a lack of}} available forces in the north. The resulting wear and tear of 4th ID's M1 Abrams and M2 Bradleys made them an ineffective unit in tight urban areas such as Jar Salah. Because their heavily armored tanks required so much maintenance, the 173d incorporated much of 4th ID's area of operation into their own. The 173d secured these areas with company sized detachments, often patrolling the 4th ID's sectors with two unarmored M998 cargo Humvees at any given time.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the Kurdish Islamist {{militant group}} <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> {{controlled}} a small section of northern Iraq {{in an area}} outside of Saddam Hussein's control. <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> had been fighting against secular Kurdish forces since 2001. At {{the time of the}} invasion they fielded about 600 to 800 fighters. <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> was led by the Jordanian-born militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who would later become an important leader in the Iraqi insurgency. <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> was driven out of Iraq in late March by a joint American-Kurdish force during Operation Viking Hammer.|$|E
5000|$|Operation Viking Hammer had {{eliminated}} <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam's</b> {{presence in}} northern Iraq, and allowed Kurdish units {{to join the}} fight against Iraqi troops in northern Iraq.|$|R
5000|$|After Turkey {{had denied}} the U.S. 4th Infantry Division passage through their borders, {{the burden of}} {{carrying}} out the northern front {{of the war in}} Iraq fell on an ad hoc coalition of Americans to include CIA Special Activities Division (SAD) paramilitary operations officers, Special Forces soldiers from 10th SFG and airborne units that parachuted into northern Iraq (however, the 173rd did not take part in Operation Viking Hammer), and Kurdish Peshmerga forces of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and Kurdish Democratic Party. Before beginning the attack south, the coalition forces first needed to destroy <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam's</b> enclave in order to secure the Kurdish rear areas and free Kurdish forces {{to take part in the}} advance southwards.|$|R
50|$|According to the Iraq's {{government}} critics, the pro-Shia {{policies of}} al-Maliki {{have been considered}} {{one of the main reasons}} of alienation Sunni Arabs and Kurds, which has played a significant role in the deterioration of security and the reemergence of Sunni extremists. Conversely, al-Maliki has accused Saudi Arabia of backing the militants of ISIL, who want to carve out a Sunni caliphate in the heart of the Middle East. This view was supported by writers in Foreign Policy magazine and The Daily Beast who asserted that the Saudi government, viewing the political ascendancy of Iraq's Shia populace as a threat, elected to provide the Sunni opposition with arms. Michael Weiss traces the origins of ISIL to <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam's</b> infiltration of Iraqi Kurdistan through Iran prior to the invasion of Iraq, and further cites a variety of evidence to claim that Syrian officials intentionally abetted the rise of ISIL to damage the reputation of moderate Syrian rebels.|$|R
25|$|Islamic {{fundamentalist}} groups include Al-Qaeda, Abu Sayyaf, <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam,</b> Armed Islamic Group of Algeria, Army of Islam, Boko Haram, Taliban, Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Jemaah Islamiyah, Hamas, Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, Indian Mujahideen, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan {{among many}} others.|$|E
25|$|Arriving in July 2002 to Iraqi Kurdistan, the CIA seldom {{worked with}} the peshmerga, despite their claim {{to be on a}} counterterrorism mission against <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam.</b> To the {{disappointment}} of PUK peshmerga intent on destroying <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam,</b> the true mission of the CIA was to acquire intelligence about the Iraqi government and military. CIA-peshmerga operations eventually went beyond the scope of intelligence gathering however, as PUK peshmerga were used to destroy key rail lines and buildings prior to the U.S. attack in March 2003. Following Turkey's decision to deny any official use of its territory, the Coalition was forced to modify the planned simultaneous attack from north and south. Special Operations forces from the CIA and US Army managed to build and lead the Kurdish Peshmerga into an effective force and assault for the North.|$|E
25|$|During the US {{occupation}} of Iraq, sporadic attacks hit Erbil. Parallel bomb attacks against Eid celebrations killed 109 people on 1 February 2004. Responsibility was {{claimed by the}} Ansar al-Sunnah, and stated to be in solidarity with <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam.</b> A suicide bombing on 4 May 2005 killed 60 civilians and injured 150 more outside a police recruiting centre.|$|E
25|$|According to one estimate, as {{of early}} 2008, 1,121 suicide bombers have blown {{themselves}} up in Iraq. Sunni suicide bombers have targeted not only thousands of civilians, but mosques, shrines, wedding and funeral processions, markets, hospitals, offices, and streets. Sunni insurgent organizations include <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam.</b> Radical groups include Al-Tawhid Wal-Jihad, Jaish al-Ta'ifa al-Mansurah, Jeish Muhammad, and Black Banner Organization.|$|E
25|$|The Central Intelligence Agency's Special Activities Division (SAD) teams, {{consisting}} of the paramilitary operations officers and 10th Special Forces Group soldiers, were the first U.S. forces to enter Iraq, in July 2002, before the main invasion. Once on the ground, they prepared for the subsequent arrival of U.S. Army Special Forces to organize the Kurdish Peshmerga. This joint team (called the Northern Iraq Liaison Element (NILE)) combined to defeat <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam,</b> a group with ties to al-Qaeda, in Iraqi Kurdistan. This battle was {{for control of the}} territory that was occupied by <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> and took place before the invasion. It was carried out by Paramilitary Operations Officers from SAD and the Army's 10th Special Forces Group. This battle resulted in the defeat of Ansar and the capture of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat. Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war.|$|E
25|$|On March 21, 2003 {{his arrest}} was ordered by Ã˜kokrim, the Norwegian law {{enforcement}} agency for financial crime, to ensure he did not leave the country while accusations that he had financed terrorist attacks using Norway as a base were investigated. Court proceedings against Krekar were however dropped when it proved impossible to prove his connections with the terrorist attacks staged in Iraq by <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> during his leadership. His term as leader ended.|$|E
25|$|CIA Special Activities Division (SAD) Paramilitary teams entered Iraq in July 2002 {{before the}} 2003 invasion. Once {{on the ground}} they {{prepared}} for the subsequent arrival of US military forces. SAD teams then combined with U.S. Army Special Forces to organize the Kurdish Peshmerga. This joint team combined to defeat <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam,</b> an ally of Al Qaida, in a battle in {{the northeast corner of}} Iraq. The U.S. side was carried out by Paramilitary Officers from SAD and the Army's 10th Special Forces Group.|$|E
25|$|Krekar was the {{original}} leader of the Islamist armed group <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam,</b> which was set up and commenced operations in Northern Iraq while he had refugee status in Norway. Krekar claims, however, not to have had foreknowledge of the various terrorist attacks performed by the group he was leading. Since February 2003 he has an expulsion order against him, which is suspended pending Iraqi government guarantees {{that he will not}} face torture or execution. Norway is committed to international treaties which prohibit the expulsion of an individual without such a guarantee.|$|E
25|$|On March 20, 2003 at {{approximately}} 02:30 UTC or about 90minutes after the lapse of the 48-hour deadline, at 05:33 local time, explosions were heard in Baghdad, signing {{the beginning of}} the U.S. led invasion. Beginning on 21 March 2003, U.S. forces launched Tomahawk missiles at selected <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> positions throughout the Sargat Valley. In preparation for the ground assault, nicknamed Operation Viking Hammer, American Lt. Col. Tovo divided his forces into six mixed peshmerga-Special Forces units. The peshmerga in two of these teams refused to contribute to the assault for various reasons including having lost too many personnel in previous fighting. The peshmerga who did fight were once again armed with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades, and other assorted weapons.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of 21 March 2003, as part of Operation Viking Hammer, a total of 64 Tomahawk cruise {{missiles}} struck the <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> camp and the surrounding sites, the terrorists group - numbering around 700 - had inhabited a valley near Halabja Iraqi Kurdistan, along with a small Kurdish splinter faction; they had prepared a number of defensive positions including anti-aircraft machine guns and maintained a facility, that US intelligence suspected, at which chemical and biological agents may have been developed and stored for future terrorist attacks. Viking Hammer was set to begin on 21 March, however the ground component of the operation was set back several days owing to the issues around infiltrating the majority of the 3rd Battalion 10th SFG into Iraq. The Islamic Group of Kurdistan surrendered after having suffered 100 men killed in the 21 March strikes.|$|E
25|$|Also In the North, the 10th Special Forces Group (10th SFG) and CIA {{paramilitary}} {{officers from}} their Special Activities Division had {{the mission of}} aiding the Kurdish parties, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party, de facto rulers of Iraqi Kurdistan since 1991, and employing them against the 13 Iraqi Divisions located near Kirkuk and Mosul. Turkey had officially prohibited any Coalition troops from using their bases or airspace, so lead elements of the 10th SFG {{had to make a}} detour infiltration; their flight was supposed to take four hours but instead took ten. On 22 March 2003, the majority of 2nd and 3rd battalion 10th SFG from Task Force Viking flew from their forward staging area in Constanta, Romania to a location near Irbil aboard six MC-130H Combat Talons, several were engaged by Iraqi air defences on the flight into northern Iraq (one was sufficiently damaged enough that it was forced to make an emergency landing at Incirlik Air Base). The initial lift had deployed a total of 19 Green Beret ODAs and four ODBs into Northern Iraq. Hours after the first of such flights, Turkey did allow the use of its air space {{and the rest of the}} 10th SFG infiltrated in. The preliminary mission was to destroy the base of the Kurdish terrorist group <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam,</b> believed to be linked to al-Qaeda. Concurrent and follow-on missions involved attacking and fixing Iraqi forces in the north, thus preventing their deployment to the southern front and the main effort of the invasion. Eventually Task Force Viking would number 51 ODAs and ODBs alongside some 60,000 Kurdish Peshmerga militia of the PUK (Patriotic Union of Kurdistan).|$|E
2500|$|On 28 March 2003, {{the ground}} element of Operation Viking Hammer was finally {{launched}} with a six-pronged advance, each prong {{was composed of}} several ODAs from 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and upwards of 1,000 Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. The main advance set off towards Sargat - {{the location of the}} suspected chemical and biological weapons site; the force was soon pinned down by DShK heavy machine gun fire from the surrounding hills. A pair of US Navy F/A-18s responded to an urgent CAS request from the force and dropped two 500lb JDAMs on the <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> machine gun nests and strafed the positions with 20mm cannon before departing due to being low on fuel. The advance began again only to be halted once more by fire from prepared DShK and PKM machine gun nests, Green Berets from ODA 081 deployed a Mk 19 grenade launcher from the back of a Toyota Tacoma and suppressed the gun positions allowing the Peshmerga to assault and wipe out the terrorists. After capturing the town of Gulp, the force continued onto the village of Sargat; the village was heavily defended by fortified fighting positions mounting DShKs and mortars along with several BM-21 Grad. Unable to call in airstrikes due to the close proximity of the Peshmerga, a Green Beret sergeant used a dismounted M2 HMG to suppress the entrenched terrorists, his actions allowed the Peshmerga to bring forward their own 82mm Mortars and Grads which forced the <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> fighters to retreat. Task Force Viking advanced to secure the Daramar Gorge - which was surrounded by caves in the rock walls â€“ the Peshmerga [...] were again engaged by small arms fire and RPGs which it and the ODAs returned fire with heavy weapons, however it became obvious that they couldn't advance any further without air support. To dislodge the terrorists, the Combat Controllers attached to the ODAs vectored in US Navy F/A-18s which dropped six 500lb JDAMs that shut down any further resistance. During the night, four AC-130 gunships maintained the pressure on the retreating <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> terrorists as they pulled back toward the Iranian border; the next day, Task Force Viking seized the high ground and pushed down through the valley - surrounding and killing small pockets of remnants from <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam.</b> With their objectives completed 3rd Battalion and their Peshmerga returned to the green line to assist the push on Kirkuk and Mosul. A specialist SSE team was brought in to document the find at Sargat, the team recovered traces of several chemicals including Ricin along with stocks of NBC protective suits, atropine injectors and Arabic manuals on chemical weapons and IED construction. Estimates of <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> dead number over 300, many of them foreign fighters, whilst only 22 Peshmerga fighters were killed.|$|E
2500|$|The Italian {{newspaper}} Corriere della Sera {{identified the}} suicide bomber as Algerian national Fahdal Nassim. Other suspects included Baathists, militant Sunni and Shiite groups, organized crime, [...] and tribal elements. Blame was initially thought to lie with <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam,</b> which was {{thought at the}} time to be Zarqawi's group. [...] An otherwise unknown group called the [...] "Armed Vanguards of the Second Mohammed Army" [...] claimed they were responsible for the attack.|$|E
2500|$|The United States {{government}} has declared <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> a terrorist group, but Krekar denies {{that it was}} during the time he headed it, and says he no longer does. While Krekar has not been found guilty of anything, a number of his opinions have met little sympathy; he was once recorded claiming that Osama bin Laden is the [...] "jewel in the crown of Islam". and that he was proud of what Abu Musab al-Zarqawi [...] "has done and that he has become a martyr".|$|E
2500|$|Kurdish {{authorities}} in the Kurdistan Regional Government have repeatedly asked for Mullah Krekar to be extradited from Norway. The death penalty remains on the books in the Kurdistan region. Most death sentences have been changed into life sentences since the Kurdistanian authorities took power in 1992, the exception being that eleven alleged members of <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> were hanged in the regional capital of Erbil in October 2006. He has as of 8 December 2006 been on the UN terror list, and as of 8 November 2007 been judged by the Supreme Court of Norway as a [...] "danger to national security".|$|E
2500|$|SAD {{paramilitary}} teams entered Iraq {{before the}} 2003 invasion. Once {{on the ground}} they prepared the battle space for the subsequent arrival of U.S. military forces. SAD teams then combined with U.S. Army special forces (on a team called the Northern Iraq Liaison Element or NILE). This team organized the Kurdish Peshmerga for the subsequent U.S. led invasion. This joint team combined in Operation Viking Hammer to defeat <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam,</b> an Islamist group allied to al-Qaeda, which several battle-hardened fighters from Afghanistan had joined {{after the fall of}} the Taliban, in a battle for control over the northeast of Iraq â€“ a battle that turned out being one of the [...] "most intense battles of Special Forces since Vietnam". This battle was for an entire territory that was completely occupied by <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> and was executed prior to the invasion in February 2003. If this battle had not been as successful as it was, there would have been a considerable hostile force in the rear of the U.S./secular Kurdish force in the subsequent assault on the Iraqi army to the south. The U.S. side was represented by paramilitary operations officers from SAD/SOG and the army's 10th Special Forces Group (10th SFG). 10th SFG soldiers were awarded three Silver Stars and six Bronze Stars with V for valor for this battle alone [...] and several paramilitary officers were awarded the Intelligence Star for valor in combat. This battle was a significant direct attack and victory on a key U.S. opponent. It resulted in the deaths of a substantial number of militants and the uncovering of a crude laboratory that had traces of poisons and information on chemical weapons at Sargat. The team found foreign identity cards, visas, and passports on the enemy bodies. They had come from a wide variety of Middle Eastern and north African countries including Yemen, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Tunisia, Morocco, and Iran. Sargat was also the only facility that had traces of chemical weapons discovered in the Iraq war.|$|E
2500|$|On December 7, 2006, the United States Department of the Treasury {{designated}} mullah Krekar {{as one of}} five individuals providing {{financial support}} to terrorist organizations. In a statement {{he is accused of}} providing funds for Ansar al-Sunnah, an active Iraqi terror-organization descended from <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam.</b> The press release states that [...] "This designation freezes any assets the designees may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits all financial and commercial transactions by any U.S. person with the designees". Mullah Krekar was later that day added to the United Nations Security Council list of individuals belonging to or associated with the Al-Qaeda organization. All member states of the United Nations are obliged to freeze assets and prevent entry or transit through their territories with regard to the individuals included on the list. Anders Romarheim, a researcher at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies, believes that the placement of mullah Krekar on this list is a United States strategy to put pressure on Norway.|$|E
2500|$|SAD's {{existence}} became {{better known}} {{as a result of}} the [...] "War on Terror". Beginning in autumn of 2001, SAD/SOG paramilitary teams arrived in Afghanistan to hunt down al-Qaeda leaders, facilitate the entry of U.S. Army Special Forces and lead the United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan against the ruling Taliban. SAD/SOG units also defeated <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> in Iraqi Kurdistan prior to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and trained, equipped, organized and led the Kurdish peshmerga forces to defeat the Iraqi Army in northern Iraq. Despite being the most covert unit in US Special Operations, numerous books have been published on the exploits of CIA paramilitary officers, including Conboy and Morrison's Feet to the Fire: CIA Covert Operations in Indonesia, and Warner's Shooting at the Moon: The Story of America's Clandestine War in Laos. Most experts consider SAD/SOG the premier force for unconventional warfare (UW), whether that warfare consists of either creating or combating an insurgency in a foreign country.|$|E
2500|$|Ground level {{embedding}} and integration. In {{tandem with}} mobility is the embedding of hardcore counter-insurgent units or troops with local {{security forces and}} civilian elements. The US Marines in Vietnam also saw some success with this method, under its CAP (Combined Action Program) where Marines were teamed as both trainers and [...] "stiffeners" [...] of local elements on the ground. US Special Forces in Vietnam like the Green Berets, also caused significant local problems for their opponents by their leadership and integration with mobile tribal and irregular forces. [...] The CIA's Special Activities Division created successful guerrilla forces from the Hmong tribe {{during the war in}} Vietnam in the 1960s, from the Northern Alliance against the Taliban during the war in Afghanistan in 2001, and from the Kurdish Peshmerga against <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> and the forces of Saddam Hussein during the war in Iraq in 2003. [...] In Iraq, the 2007 US [...] "surge" [...] strategy saw the embedding of regular and special forces troops among Iraqi army units.
