50|$|An {{optional}} feature offered by Bowler was a <b>lift</b> <b>device</b> that could <b>lift</b> the vehicle past the lowest travel {{of the front}} and rear suspension. The lift was intended to be used to assist in digging the vehicle out of soft ground or to facilitate changing a wheel. The <b>lift</b> <b>device</b> consisted of a large steel plate on a hinged sub-frame attached to the underside of the vehicle frame between {{the front and rear}} <b>axles.</b> The <b>lift</b> was lowered by a hydraulic ram that was controlled from inside the vehicle. The lift plate also served to protect the underside of vehicle when raised.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Research and {{development}} design {{is involved with}} inflatable lifting web professional boots in architecture industry limited space installation work technology field. This web-based boot includes boot body, <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> and support to support the feet and the <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> to fix on the boot body. The support uses the <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> to connect {{to the bottom of}} the boot body, and through the <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> function, it can have lifting displacement to the boot bottom. The workers put foot fixed on the support, so as to make the inflating lifting boots walk along with the workers. The adjusting <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> can make support member move far or near the bottom direction of boot body. The workers can lift higher or lower along with the support. The workers can adjust the <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> according to specific work height, without using or moving ladder or stool, to save time and improve the work efficiency. At present, the global architecture decoration industry conducts decoration construction for the inside of the house, it needs electrical workers, wood workers, pipe workers and other types of workers for construction work. Because of the height of people, the workers need to use ladder or stool to complete the work in construction. After completing a certain work region, they need to walk off the ladder or stool and move the ladder or stool to next construction location. It need...|$|R

40|$|Home support workers (HSWs) work in clients 2 ̆ 7 homes {{assisting}} with {{rehabilitation and}} activities of daily living. Like all health-care professionals, HSWs are at an increased risk for developing back injuries. <b>Lift</b> <b>devices</b> {{have been shown to}} reduce injuries to the worker. Presently, there are few <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> for home use that cost under 4000 CDN. Our study involved designing a safe and affordable <b>lift</b> <b>device</b> (retail cost under 2000 CDN) to be used by HSWs in the home and evaluating it in a typical bathroom. Thirty-eight HSWs and three seniors evaluated the BCIT lift, a commercially available lift (BHM Medical Inc.) and the manual method of transfer and lift. Results indicated that the BCIT lift was an improvement over the manual method of transferring, and approximated the more expensive, automatic lift in terms of perceived exertion, ease of use and safety.

40|$|Among nurses, {{low back}} pain is a common {{musculoskeletal}} disorder. A significant proportion of back pain episodes {{can be attributed to}} events that occur during patient handling activities when nurses are exposed to heavy lifting, awkward back postures, and pushing and/or pulling. In the past years, many ergonomic interventions have been developed, like <b>lifting</b> <b>devices,</b> to reduce mechanical load related to patient handling activities in order to (partly) decrease the occurrence of {{low back pain}}. The efficacy of <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> designed to reduce mechanical load has been demonstrated in several laboratory studies. However, the timely and integrated implementation at the workplace remains difficult. Various intervention studies have indicated that individual behaviour of nurses is a key factor in successful implementation of <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> in healthcare. As examples, Evanoff et al. (2003) and Li et al. (2004) identified the lack of perceived need to use lifts as an important barrier in the effectiveness of <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> at the workplace. Nelson et al. (2006) showed that acceptance of patient handling equipment by the staff was a crucial facilitator in the implementation process of a multiple intervention aimed at patient handling in healthcare. A previous study in hospitals and nursing homes showed that individual behaviour of nurses, i. e. nurses’ motivation to use <b>lifting</b> <b>devices,</b> was strongly associated with <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> use. This study also pointed at the influence of organisationallevel measures on nurses’ behaviour, comprising both factors in each ward {{as well as at the}} managerial level of the healthcare institute. Thus, the appropriate implementation of ergonomic devices requires a careful process whereby individual behaviour is supported by organisational measures in order to enable and support the individual to adopt the required behaviour to prevent musculoskeletal complaints. A recent systematic review corroborated that upstream organisational strategies had a profound impact on musculoskeletal health...|$|R

50|$|In Europe usually both rear tractor axles have dual wheels, while {{single or}} dual wheels {{are used for}} the cargo trailer. The most common {{combination}} used in Europe is a semi tractor with three <b>axles,</b> one a <b>lift</b> <b>axle,</b> and a cargo trailer with three axles, one also a <b>lift</b> <b>axle,</b> giving six axles and 22 wheels in total. This format is now common across Europe, due to reduced road-loading requirements, especially for bridges. The <b>lift</b> <b>axles</b> used on both tractors and trailers allow the trucks to remain legal, but reduce tyre scrub and wear while carrying lighter loads by raising an axle set off the roadway. For greater detail, see the United Kingdom section, below.|$|R
40|$|The rise in <b>Lift</b> <b>Axle</b> Trucks in Maryland Roadways {{has brought}} {{attention}} to truck policies and regulations. A <b>lift</b> <b>axle</b> {{is an additional}} axle located on the truck that {{has the ability to}} be raised or deployed based on the Gross Vehicle Weight or the weight of cargo carried by the truck. <b>Lift</b> <b>axles</b> allow the truck to carry substantially higher payloads or cargo for a small increase in vehicle cost. There is much concern in the <b>lift</b> <b>axle</b> operation (the rise and deployment) based on weight, it could {{have a significant effect on}} the condition of pavement and bridge structures. This research study examined the federal and state truck regulations as well as <b>lift</b> <b>axle</b> truck configurations. Furthermore, based on truck digital weight and size data, the study explored the behavior of pavement and highway bridges based on the rise and deployment of <b>lift</b> <b>axle,</b> punching shear, yield line analysis as well as girder analysis and pavement damage. Results show that high rear tandem axle weights will have a higher effect on pavement and bridges than compared to tridem rear axle truck configuration (single unit truck with axle down) due to the loads being more distributed...|$|R
