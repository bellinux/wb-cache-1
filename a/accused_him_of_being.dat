5|$|Belgians began campaigning against Lumumba, {{whom they}} wanted to marginalise; they <b>accused</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a {{communist}} and, hoping to fragment the nationalist movement, supported rival, ethnic-based parties like CONAKAT. Many Belgians hoped that an independent Congo would form part of a federation, like the French Community or British Commonwealth of Nations, and that close economic and political association with Belgium would continue. As independence approached, the Belgian government organised Congolese elections in May 1960. These resulted in a broad MNC majority.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the rebellion Henry le Despenser appointed John Derlington, the archdeacon of Norwich, as his vicar-general on 5 February 1400 and then submitted himself to the custody of Archbishop Arundel who accompanied him to Parliament on 20 January 1401. There his enemy Sir Thomas Erpingham falsely <b>accused</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> involved in the plot. He was finally reconciled to Henry IV when the king granted him a pardon in 1401.|$|E
5|$|McNallen is a {{controversial}} {{figure in the}} Heathen and wider Pagan community. His espousal of right-wing ethnonationalist ideas and his insistence that Heathenry should be reserved for those of Northern European ancestry has resulted in accusations of racism from both Pagans and the mainstream media. Conversely, many on the extreme right of the Heathen movement have <b>accused</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a race traitor for his opposition to Neo-Nazism and refusal to endorse white supremacism.|$|E

5|$|Morales {{has been}} praised for {{significantly}} reducing poverty and illiteracy in Bolivia {{and has been}} internationally decorated with various awards. His supporters have lauded him {{as a champion of}} indigenous rights, anti-imperialism, and environmentalism. Alternately, a number of leftist, indigenous, and environmentalist critics have accused him of failing to live up to many of his espoused values, while right-wing opponents have <b>accused</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> excessively radical and authoritarian and claimed that his defence of coca contributes to illegal cocaine production.|$|E
5|$|Northerners {{assumed that}} Fillmore, hailing from a free state, was an {{opponent}} of the spread of slavery. Southerners <b>accused</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> an abolitionist, which he hotly denied. Fillmore responded to one Alabamian in a widely published letter that slavery was an evil, but one {{that the federal government}} had no authority over. Taylor and Fillmore corresponded twice in September, with the general happy that the crisis over the South Carolinians was resolved. Fillmore, for his part, assured his running mate that the electoral prospects for the ticket looked good, especially in the Northeast.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer's immense wealth (increased by {{the success}} of his operas) and his {{continuing}} adherence to his Jewish religion set him apart somewhat from many of his musical contemporaries. They also gave rise to rumours that his success was due to his bribing musical critics. Richard Wagner (see below) <b>accused</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> interested only in money, not music. Meyerbeer was, however, a deeply serious musician and a sensitive personality. He philosophically resigned himself to being a victim of his own success: his extensive diaries and correspondence – which survived the turmoil of 20th-century Europe and have now been published in eight volumes – are an invaluable source for the history of music and theatre in the composer's time.|$|E

5|$|The vessel's only passenger, Robert Stubbs, was {{a former}} captain of slave ships. In early 1780 he was {{appointed}} by the African Committee of the Royal African Company, as the governor of Anomabu, a British fortification near Cape Coast Castle in Ghana. This position made him also vice-president of the RAC Council of the Castle. Due to his ineptitude and enmity incurred with John Roberts, governor of the Castle, Stubbs was {{forced out of the}} governorship of Anomabu by the RAC Council after nine months. Witness statements gathered by the African Committee of the RAC, <b>accused</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a semi-literate drunkard who mismanaged the slave-trading activities of the fort. Stubbs was aboard to return to Britain; Collingwood may have thought his earlier experience on slave ships would be useful.|$|E
5|$|Rising electoral {{success was}} {{accompanied}} by factional in-fighting, with a leadership contest emerging in the ASP between the incumbent Alejo Véliz and Morales, who had the electoral backing of the social movement's bases. The conflict led to a schism, with Morales and his supporters splitting to form their own party, the Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples (Instrumento Político por la Soberanía de los Pueblos – IPSP). The movement's bases defected en masse to the IPSP, leaving the ASP to crumble and Véliz to join the centre-right New Republican Force (Nueva Fuerza Republicana – NFR), for which Morales denounced him as a traitor to the cocalero cause. Continuing his activism, in 1998 Morales led another cocalero march from El Chapare to la Paz, and came under increasing criticism from the government, who repeatedly <b>accused</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> involved in the cocaine trade and mocked him for how he spoke and his lack of education.|$|E
5|$|Allen and Clay, both lawyers by profession, {{were hurt}} by a general {{distrust}} of lawyers by the Kentucky electorate. Further, Allen {{had served as}} general counsel for Aaron Burr, and several anonymous letters to the state's newspapers <b>accused</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> privy to Burr's alleged scheme to create an independent state in the southwest. Henry Clay {{was among those who}} vigorously defended Allen from the charges. Scott also frequently spoke in highly complimentary terms of Allen. As a legislator, Green Clay pushed for measures favorable to debtors; he consequently enjoyed strong support from settlers south of the Green River, many of whom were squatters and land speculators who owed substantial debts to the state. To counter Scott's hero image, Clay supporters pointed to his service with George Rogers Clark in a 1782 expedition against the Shawnee, but the impact of this line of campaigning was minimal. As the most senior Revolutionary War officer in Kentucky, Scott became the recognized leader of the state's veterans' lobby. The Independence Day celebrations held around the state just before the August 1 election provided a boost for his campaign. On election day, he garnered 22,050 votes, compared to 8,430 votes for Allen and 5,516 votes for Clay.|$|E

25|$|On 29 July 1887, Francesco Crispi {{sworn in}} as new Prime Minister. He {{was the first one}} from Southern Italy. Crispi {{immediately}} distinguished himself, for being a reformist leader, but his political style caused lot of protests from his opponents, who <b>accused</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> an authoritarian Prime Minister and a strongman.|$|E
25|$|The OutRage! {{presence}} {{was greeted with}} hostility by some other demonstrators, and Tatchell claims they <b>accused</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a Mossad agent sent to disrupt the march, of being a racist or a Zionist, a supporter of Ariel Sharon or {{an agent of the}} Central Intelligence Agency or MI5. Tatchell has written a number of articles in The Guardian on the issue.|$|E

25|$|People {{questioned}} {{the nature and}} modes of Muhammad’s revelations. The Meccans of Muhammad judged the Quranic revelation based on their understanding of ‘inspiration’. For them, poetry was closely connected to inspiration from a higher spiritual source. For this reason when Muhammad began preaching and reciting the Quran, the Meccans <b>accused</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a poet (21.5) or a ‘poet possessed’(37.36).|$|E

His previous intimidation of first officers was noted by the investigators.|$|E
25|$|A local daily, The Star {{reported}} that a proposal by Kepong MP Dr Tan Seng Giaw to regulate the Azan {{so that it will}} not be too loud or disturb non-Muslims caused a stir in the Dewan Rakyat.

25|$|The {{first real}} {{challenge}} to Tobin's {{leadership of the}} Teamsters also came in 1940. The Teamsters paid Tobin a salary of $30,000 that year, when the large union had only 450,000 members. But despite the financial encomium, dissident members of the union <b>accused</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a dictator over the union's affairs. Tobin angrily denied the charges. Over the next year, however, Tobin cracked down on dissidents and trusteed several large locals led by his political opponents.|$|E
25|$|Amnong Rubinstein {{argues that}} Shenhav's {{analysis}} of Israel within the postcolonial framework {{has been argued}} to be irrelevant, since Zionism is not a colonial movement conquering overseas territories, but rather a people returning to its homeland. {{and the concept of}} a two state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been described as unrealistic. In addition, he has been criticized by the right. Steven Plaut, for example, <b>accused</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> outright anti-zionist, as well as anti-liberal.|$|E
