40|$|Collecting <b>and</b> <b>transporting</b> waste are waste {{management}} problems on Magelang, thus optimalization {{and efficiency of}} waste collecting <b>and</b> <b>transporting</b> management needed to increase service community. Powersim is window based computer software created dynamic system model by design simulation. Simulation model of waste collecting <b>and</b> <b>transporting</b> in Magelang is drafting by determining interaction and dependence element which {{have a role in}} waste collecting <b>and</b> <b>transporting.</b> Formed concept is analyzed as model in formula or picture. Input data for waste collecting are waste volume and waste collecting equipment, input data for waste transporting are waste volume in temporary waste collecting <b>and</b> waste <b>transport</b> equipment. Simulation result show that condition of collecting <b>and</b> <b>transporting</b> solid waste system in Magelang is not optimal yet, shown from amount of untransported waste (waste residue).
