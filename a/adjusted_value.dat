The Tribunal upheld the Engineers’ Bar Association unconstitutionality claim and confirmed {{the principle that}} the Land Reform Bonds should be adjusted {{in accordance with the}} valuation principle enshrined in article 1236 of the Civil Code and Article 70 of the Constitution. The Tribunal declared article 1 of Law N° 26597 unconstitutional because “the criteria for the valuation and payment of the <b>adjusted</b> <b>value</b> of the expropriated land” responds to “a sense of basic justice, in accordance with article 70 of the Constitution,” which that law ignored when it provided for payment of “the face value amount only.” The Constitutional Tribunal also found article 2 of Law N° 26597 unconstitutional because it attempted to validate the fair value system presented in the Bonds while treating this value “in an unalterable way that failed {{to take into account the}} effects of time.” The Tribunal further declared these legal provisions unconstitutional “as they violated the valuation criteria inherent to property.” ...|$|E
5000|$|While the Tribunal’s {{decision}} reaffirmed {{that the}} Government {{is obliged to}} pay the current value of the debt, it also went further and considered several methods for calculating that current value. Among those methods was the one most commonly used to update delinquent Peruvian debts, namely the CPI method. However, the Tribunal held, without citing any supporting evidence, that using the CPI method would yield an amount that would jeopardize Peru’s compliance with other obligations, including the provision of “public services.” In other words, the Tribunal appeared to consider that Peru {{could not afford to}} pay the debt if calculated using the CPI method. Accordingly, in an act of purported balancing of the bondholders’ constitutional rights against this asserted threat to the general welfare, the Tribunal endorsed a different method: “calculating the <b>adjusted</b> <b>value</b> of the bonds by indexing the existing obligations to the equivalents in foreign currency” and then “applying the interest rate for United States Treasury Bonds.” The Tribunal thus ordered that “within six months of this Ruling, the Executive Branch shall issue a supreme decree regulating the procedure for the recording, valuation and forms of payment of the land reform bond debt.” ...|$|E

40|$|This paper formalizes {{certain aspects}} of the sales {{comparison}} approach to valuation that heretofore have been quite ad hoc. Specifically, it applies statistical theory to decisions about how many comparables to select, what the criteria for comparable selection should be, and how the proper weights for each <b>adjusted</b> <b>value</b> estimate can be determined such that the final value estimate is both unbiased and of minimum variance. Several results are derived that run counter to conventional practice; for example, it may not always be optimal to consider first the "best" comparables {{because of a lack of}} independence among their <b>adjusted</b> <b>value</b> estimates. Furthermore, it is always desirable to consider more comparables (regardless of how "bad") so long as their <b>adjusted</b> <b>value</b> estimates are optimally weighted in the final value estimate. Finally, weights usually selected for "inferior" comparables are typically too small. A final exercise empirically applies the methodology to a sample of sales.

40|$|The paper {{demonstrates}} a new adjustment method {{together with a}} very effective gross-error detection in the space resection and in the on-line aerial triangulation. The basic concept {{is well known for}} more than one hundred years, the only problem was that the algorithm is very complex and the implementation was very time consuming without modern computers. Now this barrier doesn’t exist any more. The <b>adjusted</b> <b>value</b> of the unknowns can be derived from the weighted mean value of solutions gained from minimally necessary number of control points and it is done in every combination. For example if we have five control points to solve the space resection, we can solve this task grouping three control points in every combination, and by this way we can calculate the orientation elements in ten different combinations. In this case the <b>adjusted</b> <b>value</b> of the unknowns will be the weighted mean value following the Jacobian Mean Theorem. Why is it necessary to follow this way? Because we can pick up very effectively the points with a value of gross-error and it can be done before getting the <b>adjusted</b> <b>value,</b> which is a very remarkable issue comparing with the least square method or the robust estimators. In practice, the first task is to determine the outer orientation elements, for this we usually use the collinear equations, which needs initial values of unknowns and an iteration process. In this paper I present a direct solution to solve the space resection in photogrammetry using geometrical considerations on the basis of three control points.
