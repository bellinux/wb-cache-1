5|$|Gjems-Onstad has {{authored}} several books. He {{wrote about}} the psychological warfare of the Norwegian resistance movement in DURHAM: hemmelige operasjoner i Trøndelag mot tysk okkkupasjonsmakt 1943-45, released in 1981. Durham was the codeword for the operations which {{to a large extent}} consisted of distributing flyers, brochures <b>and</b> <b>posters</b> with the purpose of demoralising the Germans. This was also the topic in Psykologisk krigføring i Norge under Annen Verdenskrig 1940-45, published in 1994.

5|$|Marketing {{included}} an MS-DOS computer game, {{part of an}} increasing trend of game tie-ins to movies. J.M. Dillard wrote the film's novelization, which was on The New York Times Best Seller list for four weeks. Paramount sold Star Trek-branded apparel through catalogues, and Kraft made a Star Trek-branded marshmallow dispenser. While Star Trek had a built-in fan market, marketing tie-ins were risky {{at the time and}} even high-grossing films could not guarantee success of related merchandise. Unlike other summer blockbusters, Star Trek had no mass-market appeal and no major food or beverage promotions, but sold pins <b>and</b> <b>posters</b> in theaters, bypassing retailers.|$|E

5|$|Within {{hours of}} Dugard's disappearance, local and {{national}} media converged on South Lake Tahoe to cover the story. Within days, dozens of local volunteers assisted in the search effort, which involved nearly every resource within the community. Within weeks, {{tens of thousands of}} fliers <b>and</b> <b>posters</b> were mailed to businesses throughout the United States. Since her favorite color was pink, the town was blanketed in pink ribbons as a constant reminder of her disappearance, and as a demonstration of support for her family by the community.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with {{the reconstruction of the}} main line station above, a new ticket hall was excavated below the concourse with two sets of escalators replacing the lifts. The escalators provide access to and from an intermediate passenger circulation level, which, in turn, gives access to the Northern line Charing Cross branch platforms and two further sets of escalators; one set each serving the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern line Bank branch platforms. Interchanges between the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern Bank Line platforms are made via a passageway at the lower level so as to avoid the need to use the escalators. An emergency stair to the intermediate interchange level is located midway along the passageway. The Victoria line platforms opened on 1 December 1968 when the second section of the line was opened between Highbury & Islington and Warren Street. Disused passages remain with tiling <b>and</b> <b>posters</b> from the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Team Meat {{released}} {{several pieces}} of merchandise related to Super Meat Boy. These include Super Meat Boy Handheld, an iOS app released on April 3, 2010 and styled on a Tiger Electronics handheld. It was released {{as a joke}} after Refenes' game Zits & Giggles {{was removed from the}} iTunes Store following a statement by Refenes that likened the iPhone to a Tiger handheld. McMillen has released a Super Meat Boy microgame for WarioWare D.I.Y. Team Meat sells charms, plush toys, <b>and</b> <b>posters</b> related to the game, as well as T-shirts, stickers, stress balls, and a limited edition Super Meat Boy comic.

5|$|The first studio scene—Donna in {{the fortune}} teller's room—was filmed on 30 November 2007, on a redressed Torchwood Hub {{set at the}} show's Upper Boat Studios. The outdoor scenes in Shan Shen—comprising Tennant's entire {{contribution}} to the episode—were filmed on 1 December 2007 in Splott and near the Cardiff Royal Infirmary. The shoot was marred by difficulties: rain delayed redressing the alley from the hanzi banners <b>and</b> <b>posters</b> to the Bad Wolf versions; and several extras left at lunchtime because of a misunderstanding over their payment. The final scene filmed on the day was the Doctor's examination of the Time Beetle in the fortune teller's room. The scenes in the country hotel were filmed at Egerton Grey Country House Hotel in Porthkerry on 3 December 2007.|$|E

5|$|The Nazis used several public {{relations}} tactics {{to convince the}} general population of Germany not to smoke. Well-known health magazines like the Gesundes Volk (Healthy People), Volksgesundheit (People's Health) and Gesundes Leben (Healthy Life) published warnings about the health consequences of smoking <b>and</b> <b>posters</b> showing the harmful effects of tobacco were displayed. Anti-smoking messages were sent to the people in their workplaces, often {{with the help of the}} Hitler-Jugend (HJ) and the Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM). The anti-smoking campaign undertaken by the Nazis also included health education. In June 1939, a Bureau against the Hazards of Alcohol and Tobacco was formed and the Reichsstelle für Rauschgiftbekämpfung (Reich Office for Drug Control) also helped in the anti-tobacco campaign. Articles advocating nonsmoking were published in the magazines Die Genussgifte (The Recreational Stimulants), Auf der Wacht (On the Guard) and Reine Luft (Clean Air). Out of these magazines, Reine Luft was the main journal of the anti-tobacco movement. Karl Astel's Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research at Jena University purchased and distributed hundreds of reprints from Reine Luft.|$|E
