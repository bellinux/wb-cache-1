5|$|Amino acids {{are either}} used to {{synthesize}} proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea {{and carbon dioxide}} {{as a source of}} energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the <b>amino</b> <b>group</b> by a transaminase. The <b>amino</b> <b>group</b> is fed into the urea cycle, leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton {{in the form of a}} keto acid. Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle, for example the deamination of glutamate forms α-ketoglutarate. The glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis (discussed below).|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{must first}} pass out of organelles and cells into blood {{circulation}} via amino acid transporters, since the amine and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized. Degradation of an amino acid, {{occurring in the}} liver and kidneys, often involves deamination by moving its <b>amino</b> <b>group</b> to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. This process involves transaminases, often {{the same as those}} used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the <b>amino</b> <b>group</b> is then removed through the urea cycle and is excreted in the form of urea. However, amino acid degradation can produce uric acid or ammonia instead. For example, serine dehydratase converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia. After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by entering glycolysis or the citric acid cycle, as detailed in image at right.|$|E

In the pH range 7 - 10 the vast majority of <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> in all five histones are buried. However, at higher pH values some of the histone <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> become exposed, and the higher the lysine:arginine ratio for the histone the greater was the degree of unmasking observed. At pH 11. 8 histone I appears to be completely dissociated, histones IIB 1 and IIb 2 have approx. 55 % of the <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> unmasked, and histones III and IV have approx. 25 % of the <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> unmasked...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{reaction}} {{behaviors of}} a heterobifunctional MCT/VS reactive dyes with <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> and phenol groups were investigated at pH 7 - 10 and temperature 50 - 90 o C {{by means of}} high performance liquid chromatography. Optimum reaction conditions for MCT/VS reactive dye and amino/phenol groups were obtained at 60 - 80 o C and pH 8 - 9. As <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> and phenol groups reacted with MCT/VS reactive dye individually, <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> preferred to bond with VS groups but phenol groups preferred to MCT <b>groups.</b> As <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> and phenol groups coexisted in the MCT/VS reactive dye solution, there was a main reaction product originated from the MCT/VS reactive dye molecule bonding with phenol groups by its MCT groups and bonding with <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> by VS groups respectively. ...|$|R
5|$|An {{amino acid}} is also {{amphoteric}} {{with the added}} complication that the neutral molecule is subject to an internal acid–base equilibrium in which the basic <b>amino</b> <b>group</b> attracts and binds the proton from the acidic carboxyl group, forming a zwitterion.|$|E
5|$|CPG is {{commonly}} defined by its pore size. In oligonucleotide chemistry, pore sizes of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000Å {{are used to}} allow the preparation of about 50, 80, 100, 150, and 200-mer oligonucleotides, respectively. To make native CPG suitable for further processing, {{the surface of the}} material is treated with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane to give aminopropyl CPG. The aminopropyl arm may be further extended to result in long chain aminoalkyl (LCAA) CPG. The <b>amino</b> <b>group</b> is then used as an anchoring point for linkers suitable for oligonucleotide synthesis (see below).|$|E
5|$|In plants, {{nitrogen}} {{is first}} assimilated into organic compounds {{in the form}} of glutamate, formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. In order to form other amino acids, the plant uses transaminases to move the <b>amino</b> <b>group</b> to another alpha-keto carboxylic acid. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too.|$|E
30|$|The {{density of}} the composite’s surface <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> as {{estimated}} by surface imine formation procedure [8] was 0.18 molecules/nm 2. About 0.00079 % of the total <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> added to the feed solution are available as surface <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> while 99.99921 % is locked up within the composite’s body. The locked up <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> become gradually exposed for antimicrobial action as the composite dissolves and worn out {{in the course of}} application. These results along with the observations made from NMR analyses confirm that <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> {{are an integral part of}} the fibers. The pattern of silver ion release [9] from AgNO 3 -PVP/APTMS/TEOS fibers is illustrated in Figure  2 d. The rapid buildup of high initial concentration of silver ions in the first 24 h followed by a steady and slow increase in concentration confers the fiber mat with quick and long-lasting antimicrobial activity.|$|R
5000|$|Thymine and uracil, nucleic {{bases of}} {{thymidine}} and uridine, respectively, {{do not have}} exocyclic <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> and hence do not require any protection. In contrast, nucleic bases adenine, cytosine, and guanine bear the exocyclic <b>amino</b> <b>groups,</b> which are reactive with the activated phosphoramidites under {{the conditions of the}} coupling reaction. Although, at the expense of additional steps in the synthetic cycle, the oligonucleotide chain assembly may be carried out using phosphoramidites with unprotected <b>amino</b> <b>groups,</b> most often these are kept permanently protected over {{the entire length of the}} oligonucleotide chain assembly. The protection of the exocyclic <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> have to be orthogonal to that of the 5'-hydroxy group because the latter is removed at the end of each synthetic cycle. The simplest to implement and hence the most widely accepted is the strategy where the exocyclic <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> bear a base-labile protection. Most often, two protection schemes are used.|$|R
50|$|The {{types of}} TAILS {{differ in the}} methods used to block and label the <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> of the {{proteins}} and protease cleavage products. These <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> include lysine-amines and the free (∝)-amino groups of the N-termini of the proteins.|$|R
5|$|The {{peptide bond}} has two {{resonance}} forms that contribute some double-bond character and inhibit rotation around its axis, {{so that the}} alpha carbons are roughly coplanar. The other two dihedral angles in the peptide bond determine the local shape assumed by the protein backbone. The end with a free <b>amino</b> <b>group</b> {{is known as the}} N-terminus or amino terminus, whereas the end of the protein with a free carboxyl group is known as the C-terminus or carboxy terminus (the sequence of the protein is written from N-terminus to C-terminus, from left to right).|$|E
5|$|When {{taken up}} into the human body from the diet, the 20 {{standard}} amino acids either are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide {{as a source of}} energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the <b>amino</b> <b>group</b> by a transaminase; the <b>amino</b> <b>group</b> is then fed into the urea cycle. The other product of transamidation is a keto acid that enters the citric acid cycle. Glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis. Of the 20 standard amino acids, nine (His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, Trp and Val) are called essential amino acids because the human body cannot synthesize them from other compounds at the level needed for normal growth, so they must be obtained from food. In addition, cysteine, taurine, tyrosine, and arginine are considered semiessential amino-acids in children (though taurine is not technically an amino acid), because the metabolic pathways that synthesize these amino acids are not fully developed. The amounts required also depend on the age and health of the individual, so it is hard to make general statements about the dietary requirement for some amino acids. Dietary exposure to the non-standard amino acid BMAA has been linked to human neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS.|$|E
5|$|However, not all peptide {{bonds are}} formed in this way. In a few cases, {{peptides}} are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide glutathione {{is an essential}} part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids. In the first step, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamic acid through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the <b>amino</b> <b>group</b> of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione.|$|E

40|$|Spermine is a {{substrate}} of lentil seedling amine oxidase and is oxidized at terminal <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> to a dialdehyde: 2 mol {{of hydrogen}} peroxide and two mol of ammonia per mol of spermine are formed.

40|$|Membranes of sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} were labelled with 1 -fluoro- 2, 4 -dinitro[3 H]benzene at pH 6. 5 {{and with}} 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzenesulphonate at pH 9. 2. Conditions {{were chosen to}} restrict reaction to <b>amino</b> <b>groups,</b> {{and the effect of}} blockings of these groups by methyl acetimidate was determined. All proteins were labelled to some extent by both reagents, but, whereas the trinitrophenylation of both lipid and protein <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> was almost completely blocked by methyl acetimidate, the dinitrophenylation of the ATPase at pH 6. 5 was much less affected. The seven <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> on the ATPase that were labelled under these conditions did not react with methyl acetimidate. This reagent can therefore be used to enhance the specificity of fluorodinitrobenzene for <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> in a hydrophobic environment. The <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> on the minor proteins and on the phospholipids that reacted with fluorodinitrobenzene at pH 6. 5 were probably in an aqueous environment, since the reaction was blocked by methyl acetimidate...|$|R
5|$|Most {{proteins}} {{consist of}} linear polymers built from series {{of up to}} 20 different L-α-amino acids. All proteinogenic amino acids possess common structural features, including an α-carbon to which an <b>amino</b> <b>group,</b> a carboxyl group, and a variable side chain are bonded. Only proline differs from this basic structure as it contains an unusual ring to the N-end amine group, which forces the CO–NH amide moiety into a fixed conformation. The side chains of the standard amino acids, detailed {{in the list of}} standard amino acids, have a great variety of chemical structures and properties; it is the combined effect of all of the amino acid side chains in a protein that ultimately determines its three-dimensional structure and its chemical reactivity.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{nucleic base}} of {{guanosine}} and 2'-deoxyguanosine {{does have an}} exocyclic <b>amino</b> <b>group,</b> its basicity is low to an extent {{that it does not}} react with phosphoramidites under the conditions of the coupling reaction. However, a phosphoramidite derived from the N2-unprotected 5'-O-DMT-2'-deoxyguanosine is poorly soluble in acetonitrile, the solvent commonly used in oligonucleotide synthesis. In contrast, the N2-protected versions of the same compound dissolve in acetonitrile well and hence are widely used. Nucleic bases adenine and cytosine bear the exocyclic amino groups reactive with the activated phosphoramidites under the conditions of the coupling reaction. By the use of additional steps in the synthetic cycle or alternative coupling agents and solvent systems, the oligonucleotide chain assembly may be carried out using dA and dC phosphoramidites with unprotected amino groups. However, these approaches currently remain in the research stage. In routine oligonucleotide synthesis, exocyclic amino groups in nucleosides are kept permanently protected over {{the entire length of the}} oligonucleotide chain assembly.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} amine and {{carboxylic}} acid groups of amino acids can {{react to form}} amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the <b>amino</b> <b>group</b> of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As {{a result of this}} mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.|$|E
