5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic {{muscles of the}} tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve.

5|$|Alderson's {{situation}} worsened at the Battle of Festubert in May 1915, {{when the}} Canadian Division {{failed to make}} any headway and suffered nearly 2,500 casualties. Another operation a month later, the Second Battle of Givenchy, cost 366 casualties for no appreciable gain. Again, Alderson was not solely at fault in these actions and he remained popular with British Army Headquarters, Prime Minister Borden and with his men, resulting in promotion to command the entire Canadian Expeditionary Force when a second Division arrived late in 1915. Despite this popularity, Sam Hughes continued to hold a grudge against Alderson and opposed him in political circles, taking offense at Alderson's refusal to accept promotions made by Hughes or Carson of untried Canadian officers and instead promoting veteran British officers in their place. The main area of argument {{between the two men}} however was <b>again</b> <b>over</b> the Ross rifle.|$|E

5|$|Early on October26, a {{tropical}} depression {{formed in the}} central Gulf of Mexico, and intensified into Hurricane Juan while meandering northward. The storm had a large wind field and was somewhat subtropical in nature. Due to weak steering currents, Juan looped once offshore Louisiana and later looped <b>again</b> <b>over</b> the state, weakening into {{a tropical}} storm over land on October29. The storm turned eastward and later northeastward, striking just west of Pensacola, Florida late on October31. Juan turned to the north over land and became extratropical on November1 over Tennessee. After the remnants of Juan continued to the north into Canada, it spawned an occluded low in the Tennessee Valley. This low continued to the east through North Carolina, bringing moderate rainfall throughout the region, and saturating soils; overcast skies and the weak sunlight of early November prevented much of the rains from evaporating.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{sequence}} of Cabo Verde hurricanes, Lisa began as a tropical wave that developed into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on September20, about 460mi (740km) southwest of Cabo Verde. An unusually weak subtropical ridge steered the system north, east, and north <b>again</b> <b>over</b> subsequent days. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Lisa six hours after formation, but fell back to tropical depression intensity by 18:00UTC on September22 as dry air entered the circulation. A more favorable environment allowed Lisa to re-attain tropical storm status by 12:00UTC the following day and subsequently begin a period of rapid intensification; it reached hurricane intensity by 21:00UTC on September24 and reached peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) six hours later. Progressively cooler waters and stronger shear caused Lisa to weaken to a tropical storm early on September25, weaken to a tropical depression early on September26, and degenerate into a remnant low at 18:00UTC that day. The remnant low moved northwest and north, dissipating by 06:00UTC on September29 about 595mi (960km) south-southwest of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes {{to visit}} Madame Zirinka again, who {{tells him that}} the planets come into {{alignment}} like this only once every 84 years, and additional alignments will cause anyone born on January 12, 1979 (Margi and Terri's birthdate) {{to have all the}} energy in the cosmos focused on them. Margi goes to see Scott alone but an angry Terri arrives. The two argue with each other and end up accidentally killing Scott. Margi goes to Mulder, telling him that Terri is responsible for the murders, while Terri goes to see Scully and tells her the opposite. The agents call each other and bring both girls to the police station, where the place starts shaking and all the guns go off on their own. Mulder locks the girls in a room together and their power goes away once the clock ticks midnight. When the town mob and Detective White finally see Terri and Margi as the culprits, Spitz claims it was the work of Satan, oblivious to the cosmic alignment's energy. Mulder and Scully drive home, arguing <b>again</b> <b>over</b> directions; when Scully defiantly runs a stop sign, Mulder notifies her but she tells him to shut up, which he does.|$|E

5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men {{began to see}} the sun rise <b>again</b> <b>over</b> the Yukon—it was a very short day for them, and none had been able to sleep for the {{excitement}} of the trip, the stimulant benzedrine, and the penetrating cold. Crossing into Canada, the headwinds grew stronger still, and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load picked up in the night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Alessia was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to affect the Northern Territory of Australia in November since Cyclone Joan in 1975. The storm was first identified as a tropical low on 20November 2013 well to the northwest of Australia. Tracking generally west to west-southwest, the small system steadily organized into a tropical cyclone by 22November. Maintaining a small central dense overcast, Alessia brushed the Kimberley region before making landfall in the Top End region with winds of 65km/h (40mph) on 23 and 24November respectively. Some weakening took place as the system moved over land; however, reorganization occurred as it neared the Gulf of Carpentaria. After moving over water on 26November, it redeveloped gale-force winds. Alessia reached its peak intensity on 27November with winds of 85km/h (50mph) and a barometric pressure of 991mbar (hPa; 29.26inHg) and subsequently made its final landfall near Wollogorang. Weakening ensued once more as the storm traveled over land; though, Alessia's remnants looped eastward back over water before doubling back to the west. The system was last noted moving inland <b>again</b> <b>over</b> the Northern Territory on 1December.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Hermine caused {{significant}} {{flooding in}} Mexico during September1980. The eleventh tropical cyclone and eight named storm of the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season, Hermine developed from a tropical wave that emerged into the Atlantic {{from the west}} coast of Africa on September 11. After uneventfully crossing the Atlantic Ocean, the system developed a well-defined circulation while in the Caribbean Sea on September 20 and was then classified as a tropical depression. After becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression steadily strengthened as it tracked nearly due westward. By September 21, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Hermine and brushed the northern coast of Honduras shortly thereafter. It nearly became a hurricane before it made landfall in Belize on September 22. After weakening over the Yucatan Peninsula, Hermine restrengthened to near-hurricane status <b>again</b> <b>over</b> the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall in the Mexican state of Veracruz. Hermine steadily weakened inland and eventually dissipated on September 26.|$|E
