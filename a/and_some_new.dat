5|$|In 1844, {{an organ}} by Gray & Davison of London was {{installed}} in the cathedral, replacing an instrument with parts dating back to 1626.

It was later moved to its present position {{at the front of}} the north transept. In 1910 William Hill and Son of London extensively rebuilt and revoiced the organ, replacing the Cavaillé-Coll reeds with new pipes of their own. The choir division of the organ was enlarged and moved behind the choirstalls on the south side. The instrument was again overhauled by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool in 1969, when a new mechanism <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>new</b> pipework made to a design by the organist, Roger Fisher, was installed. Since 1991 the organ has been in the care of David Wells of Liverpool.|$|E
