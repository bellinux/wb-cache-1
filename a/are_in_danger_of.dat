5|$|Norgrove {{was removed}} from the scene via {{helicopter}} and received medical care, but she died. It was reported initially that she had been killed by one of her captors setting off a suicide vest. According to The Guardian, insurgents often put on suicide vests if they think they <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> being attacked. Taliban commanders Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan (who were holding Norgrove) were among those killed in the raid, according to an Afghan intelligence official. Other women and children in the compound were uninjured, and no members of the rescue team were wounded.|$|E

5|$|Richard Nixon: The Shaping of His Character was {{published}} in late 1981 and received reviews less enthusiastic than any of her earlier books. Writing in The New Republic, Godfrey Hodgson questioned both her psychoanalytic approach and her motives: “e <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> having the insights of psychotherapy used {{as a tool for}} character destruction, certainly for libel, potentially for revenge.” Sales of the book were disappointing, {{in part because of the}} reviews, in part because memoirs by Nixon associates such as Henry Kissinger, John Ehrlichman, and John Dean had recently flooded the market. Perhaps Brodie’s book was most influential in stimulating Oliver Stone to create his controversial 1995 movie Nixon.|$|E
5|$|Two {{species of}} birds in the park <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> disappearing. The range of the Cape Sable seaside sparrow is {{restricted}} to Everglades National Park and the Big Cypress Swamp. In 1981 6,656 Cape Sable seaside sparrows were reported in park boundaries, but surveys over 10 years documented a decline to an estimated 2,624 birds by 2002. Attempts to return natural levels of water to the park have been controversial; Cape Sable seaside sparrows nest about a foot off the ground, and rising water levels may harm future populations, as well as threaten the endangered snail kite. The Everglades snail kite eats apple snails almost exclusively, and the Everglades is the only location in the United States where this bird of prey exists. There {{is some evidence that}} the population may be increasing, but loss of habitat and food sources keep the estimated number of these birds at several hundred.|$|E

25|$|Since Fort Campbell was decommissioned, it {{has fallen}} {{into a state of}} neglect and disrepair. It still retains most of its {{original}} features, although many rooms are in ruins. The fort was vandalized repeatedly, and in 2004 the fire control position was completely destroyed by vandals. At some point, the iron beams that supported the roof of the barracks were stolen, and due to this some of the blocks have collapsed or <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> collapsing. Since the fort is abandoned, it is possible to enter, but parts of it are dangerous to visitors.|$|E

25|$|Meat {{often comes}} from hunting. Conservation groups are {{concerned}} that, {{with the rise}} in the human population, many animal species <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> extinction because of the trade in bushmeat. Chimpanzee, bonobo, wild boar, monkey, antelope, and other wild animals are often sold in the market or at impromptu stalls around the town. In 1998, Jeff Dupain and others catalogued the types of bushmeat available in the two main Basankusu markets; they interviewed the stallholders to find out where the animals were hunted. Many people keep livestock around the family home. Chickens, pigs, and, less frequently, sheep and goats provide fresh food and a source of income.|$|E
25|$|Recruits {{begin work}} toward earning their tan belt in the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP). Physical {{training}} gradually {{becomes more and}} more intense as recruits begin to get stronger and their bodies accustomed to the strain. Recruits undergo the first of their conditioning marches, which will grow in length (from 1.5 miles with a light pack to a 10-mile hike with full loadout {{at the end of the}} Crucible). Periodic fitness tests assess which recruits need more attention, and those who consistently fail to meet the minimum <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> being sent to the PCP. Recruits will conduct two pugil stick bouts and are introduced to the obstacle course.|$|E
25|$|Just {{outside the}} city proper on the highway to Guaymas is the Centro Ecológico de Sonora (Ecological Center of Sonora).

The Sonoran {{collection}} is part of one of CES's main functions, which is to preserve the flora and fauna of the state. The collection contains representations of animals and plants from the four main habitats of the state: mountains, grassland, desert and sea. Some of the species <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> extinction such as the bighorn sheep, the white-tailed deer as well as a number of bird and reptile species.|$|E

25|$|Querétaro has {{a number}} of areas which lend {{themselves}} to ecotourism. One area especially promoted is the Sierra Gorda region. The area is a complex of canyons and mountains extending over 400,000 hectares with a well conserved biological diversity. In the deep canyons there are grottos, valleys, ravines and arroyos. In the higher areas there are forests of pines and holm oak, and tropical forests in the lower elevations. The area was declared a biological reserve and contains about 1,700 species of plants, some endemic only to the area. There are also 360 species of birds, 130 of mammals, and just over 100 of amphibians and reptiles. A number of these <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> extinction such as macaws, the black bear, the porcupine and the spider monkey.|$|E
25|$|The Parque del Pueblo (People's Park) is an 8.5-hectare {{area which}} has an {{artificial}} lake, a zoo and a train that tours the area. The park was opened in 1975 and also contains a natural history museum, spaces for educational workshops, a lake and an open-air theatre. The center of the park is its zoo. It {{and the rest of}} the park were closed in 2001 for extensive renovations and reopened in 2003. The zoo houses 260 animals of 57 different species, 31 of which <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> extinction. It has also successfully bred species such as white-tailed deer, Bengal tigers, llamas, bison and coyotes. The park receives about 20,000 visitors per year with the zoo charging only five pesos for admission. The admission charge finances administration costs and also goes into a fund to treat drug addiction in the city.|$|E
25|$|Data also {{appeared}} in the crossover graphic novel series , set in 2368, in which the Borg Collective joins forces with the Cybermen when the latter invade their universe. Data and {{the crew of the}} Enterprise-D form an alliance of their own with the Eleventh Doctor-who immediately recognizes Data as an android upon seeing him-and his companions, Amy Pond and Rory Williams. The group later forms a reluctant truce with the Borg, who have been betrayed by the Cybermen and <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> falling to them. Data and the others manage to restore the Borg Collective and destroy the Cybermen, but their Borg liaison then attempts to seize control of the Doctor's TARDIS. The time machine's intelligence then briefly transfers itself into Data to escape the Borg's control, and the empowered Data overpowers the Borg and throws him out into the Time Vortex.|$|E
