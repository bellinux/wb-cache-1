5|$|The family {{received}} the video from Capaldi on 3 November 2014. After viewing the video, Thomas felt encouraged to attend his grandmother's funeral. In {{an interview with}} The Guardian, Ross Goodall explained that Capaldi's mention of sadness resonated with the child due to his experience of grief over his grandmother's death. He discussed {{the manner in which}} Thomas perceived emotions as a strict dichotomy between positive and negative without a middle ground. Thomas interpreted from the video that it was <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> feel happy while simultaneously acknowledging that a sad event had occurred. Ross Goodall told The Guardian that before viewing the video from Capaldi, his son had not wanted to attend the funeral.|$|E

Lisa concludes that what her father said about risks was right– until the alarm goes off and guard dogs chase them out of the building.|$|E

This happens when, for example, the directors of a bank are trustees for the depositors, the directors of a corporation are trustees for the stockholders or a guardian is trustee of their ward's property.

25|$|His {{adoptive father}} was a {{hard-working}} coal miner, but the family still had trouble making ends meet. Gavin quit school after eighth grade and became a full-time clerk at a shoe store for $12.50 a week. His next stint was as a manager for Jewel Oil Company. A combination of restlessness and limited future opportunities in his hometown caused Gavin {{to run away from}} home. In March 1924, on his 17th birthday, he took the night train to New York. The first thing he did upon arriving was to send a telegram to his parents saying everything was <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> prevent them from reporting him missing to the police. After that, he started looking for a job.|$|E

500|$|Chang called Dylan's father [...] "a stiff Asian stereotype", while Mohan of The Oregonian {{found it}} {{contradictory}} for an anti-racist film to contain such depiction. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian even {{claimed that the}} line [...] "If you can barely beat a little black girl" [...] (spoken by Dylan's father) signifies that Atchison [...] "thinks it's <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> bring in racism by making the Asians the racists." [...] Metro Silicon Valleys Richard von Busack commented that [...] "tepping around black stereotypes, the film squishes its two left feet right in the mire of Asian stereotyping." [...] Beth Accomando of KPBS also criticized Dylan and his father's portrayal as [...] "painful cliches", while Schager of Slant Magazine found it not authentic, even likening Dylan's father to Mao Zedong.|$|E
500|$|On 20 July 1976, {{childhood}} friends Sumner and Hook separately {{attended a}} Sex Pistols {{show at the}} Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy his first bass guitar. Sumner later said that {{he felt that the}} Pistols [...] "destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship". Inspired by the performance, Sumner and Hook formed a band with their friend Terry Mason, who had also attended the show. Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. They invited schoolfriend Martin Gresty to join as vocalist, but he turned them down after getting a job at a local factory. An advertisement was placed in the Virgin Records shop in Manchester for a vocalist. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he [...] "knew he was <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in".|$|E

500|$|Both Bevin and McConnell were {{critical}} of a February 2014 ruling by U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn II that held that {{an amendment to}} the Kentucky Constitution banning same-sex marriage violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Bevin pointed out that Heyburn once worked for McConnell, who supported his nomination to the bench by President George H. W. Bush. Later in the month, Bevin told The Janet Mefford Show, [...] "If it's <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> have same-sex marriages, why not define a marriage– because {{at the end of the}} day, a lot of this ends up being taxes and who can visit who in the hospital and there's other repercussions and things that come with it– so a person may want to define themselves as being married to one of their children so that they can then in fact pass on certain things to that child financially and otherwise." [...] Critics charged that Bevin was suggesting that the legalization of same-sex marriage could lead to the acceptance of incestuous relationships; a Bevin spokesperson responded, [...] " [...] sees no comparison between gay marriage and incest. He was discussing the implications of the legal rights related to this issue such as hospital visitations and benefits. To imply otherwise is ridiculous." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007 the duo fronted the UK {{version of}} Apple Inc.'s [...] "Get a Mac" [...] adverts, with Mitchell playing PC. The adverts {{received}} much criticism. Writing in The Guardian, Charlie Brooker {{claimed that the}} use of Mitchell and Webb in the adverts was a curious choice. He compared the characters of PC and Mac in the adverts to those of Mark and Jeremy in Peep Show, stating that [...] "when you see the ads, you think, 'PCs are a bit rubbish yet ultimately lovable, whereas Macs are just smug, preening tossers.'" [...] The British Sitcom Guide also criticised the pair for [...] "selling their souls". One journalist called the adverts [...] "worse than not funny", and accused Mitchell and Webb of [...] "an act of grave betrayal" [...] for taking corporate work. In an interview with The Telegraph, Robert Webb responded to the duo's critics, stating that [...] "when someone asks, 'Do you want to do some funny ads for not many days in the year and be paid more than you would be for an entire series of Peep Show?' the answer, obviously, is, 'Yeah, that's fine.'" [...] In the same interview, Mitchell also said: [...] "I don't see what is morally inconsistent with a comedian doing an advert. It's <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> sell computers, isn't it? Unless you think that capitalism is evil– which I don't. It's not like we're helping to flog a baby-killing machine." ...|$|E
500|$|Cosimo kept himself apprised of his wife's {{conduct in}} France through the Tuscan emissiary, Gondi. Marguerite Louise {{frequently}} demanded {{more money from}} the Grand Duke, while he was scandalised by her behaviour: she took up with a groom named Gentilly. In January 1680 the Abbess of Montemarte asked Cosimo {{to pay for the}} construction of a reservoir, following a scandal at the convent: The Grand Duchess had placed her pet dog's basket in close proximity to the fire, and the basket burst into flames, but instead of trying to extinguish it, she urged her fellow nuns to flee for their lives. On previous occasions, she had explicitly stated that she would burn down the convent if the Abbess disagreed with her, too, making the Abbess view the accident as an intentional. Cosimo, unable to do much else for fear of upsetting Louis XIV, reproached her in a series of letters. Another scandal erupted that summer, the Grand Duchess bathed nude, as was the custom, in a local river. Cosimo exploded with anger upon hearing of this. Louis XIV, tiring of Florence's petitions, retorted: [...] "Since Cosimo had consented to the retirement of his wife into France, he had virtually relinquished <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> interfere in her conduct." [...] Following Louis XIV's rebuff, Cosimo fell grievously ill, only to be roused by Francesco Redi, his physician, who helped him reform his ways so illness would never strike him again. It was after this event that Cosimo finally stopped bothering with the Grand Duchess's life. In 1682 Cosimo III appointed his brother, Francesco Maria de' Medici, Governor of Siena.|$|E

500|$|Between landing {{the role}} in The Hunger Games and the film's release, {{he played a}} lead role and served as an {{executive}} producer for two films: Detention (2011) and The Forger (2012). In Detention, he {{played the role of}} popular teenager Clapton Davis in a film the plot of which has been compared to 1985's The Breakfast Club. His role in The Forger was as a 15-year-old orphan who finds himself in trouble until Alfred Molina's character comes to his aid. The film was not well received but the actors' chemistry together and their performance was. He next reprised his role as Sean Anderson in the 2012 Journey to the Center of the Earth sequel, [...] Hutcherson has always been vocal about his desire to work on films of all sorts of genres. Regarding the switch from comedy-drama The Kids Are <b>All</b> <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> the Journey sequel, he stated: [...] "For me, I like to do all different types of films and to go from having that awesome [...] kind of thing that I love doing so much with great characters and a really great script to a bigger kind of studio film, to just cover the whole kind of spectrum of movies is really, really cool." [...] Although the film was largely panned, it fared well commercially and his performance was well received, with Kofi Outlaw of Screenrant.com appreciating how he [...] "does a good job holding the screen and portraying a somewhat layered protagonist". Later in 2012, he appeared in Red Dawn, a remake of the 1984 film of the same name. The film was panned by critics, achieving only a 12 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the lowest score of any film Hutcherson has acted in.|$|E

2500|$|The {{loneliness}} in Orbison's {{songs that}} he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: [...] "I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else... Although if you grow up in West Texas, {{there are a lot}} of ways to be lonely." [...] His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees stated, [...] "He made emotion fashionable, that it was <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things... Before that no one would do it." [...] Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: [...] "When [...] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry." [...] Peter Lehman, on the other hand, considered Orbison's theme of constant vulnerability an element of sexual masochism.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Hugo Black {{noted that}} the §9 of the statute made it illegal for federal workers to engage in {{political}} activity, and yet explicitly protected the right of workers to [...] "express their opinions on all political subjects and candidates." [...] Black also {{refused to accept the}} conclusions to be drawn from the doctrine of privilege: [...] "Had this measure deprived five million farmers or a million businessmen of <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> participate in elections, because Congress thought that federal farm or business subsidies might prompt some of them to exercise, or be susceptible to, a corrupting influence on politics or government, I would not sustain such an Act on the ground that it could be interpreted so as to apply only to some of them." [...] Black concluded that, on its face, the Hatch Act and implementing civil service regulations were unconstitutionally overbroad (a fact even the government had admitted in its brief, Black said).|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, {{one year}} after their live debut and now dubbed the Stooges, the band signed with Elektra Records, again {{following}} in the footsteps of The Doors, who were Elektra's biggest act at the time (reportedly, Pop called Moe Howard to see if it was <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> call his band [...] "The Stooges," [...] to which Howard responded by merely saying [...] "I don't care what they call themselves, as long as they're not the Three Stooges!" [...] and hung up the phone). The Stooges' first album The Stooges, (on which Pop was credited as [...] "Iggy Stooge"), was produced by John Cale in New York in 1969. Both it and the follow-up, Fun House produced by Don Gallucci in Los Angeles in 1970, sold poorly. Though the release of Fun House did not receive the recognition it expected, it was later ranked #191 in Rolling Stone's '500 Greatest Albums of All Time' in 2003. Shortly after the new members joined, the group disbanded because of Pop's worsening heroin addiction.|$|E
