50|$|The five stages (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance) {{proposed}} by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in her model of grief {{to describe the}} process by which people cope after a loss can also be present in <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief.</b> Anxiety, dread, guilt, helplessness, hopelessness, and feeling overwhelmed are also common. However, {{it is important to note}} that <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> is not simply normal grief begun earlier.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> occurs before bereavement, {{mourning}} {{after death}} occurs, and upon realizing that death may be imminent for a loved one, <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> sets in.

The grief becomes anticipatory due to {{the knowledge that the}} loved one's mental state will only become worse, so the grieving process can start very early.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the experiences of Hospice Bereavement Coordinators (HBCs) and Hospice Chaplains working with grief narratives from patient-family units exhibiting signs of <b>anticipatory</b> or complicated <b>grief.</b> While {{a significant amount of}} research has been conducted on Hospice employees, no qualitative studies have examined the interpretation of meaning from employees whose primary role focused on the psychosocial-spiritual aspects of clients exhibiting <b>anticipatory</b> or complicated <b>grief.</b> The researcher identified shared meaning of death, trauma, and loss from six participants {{in the context of a}} high stress and high loss environment. This study‘s findings revealed ten central themes: Death is an earthly transition to immortality; Death is an intense progression; Trauma is an interpretive response to a bad experience; Trauma highlights quality of life; Loss is an adaptation to change; Loss highlights self-awareness about mortality; Cases impact views of death, trauma, and loss; Influences of spirituality; Stressful aspects of working in hospice settings; and Methods of coping. Through this study, the researcher captured five elements of the shared phenomena: the conflicting nature of <b>anticipatory</b> or complicated <b>grief</b> with the participant‘s interpretation of death; the acknowledgement of loss as the next stage for survivors of the deceased; the instability patient-family units exhibiting <b>anticipatory</b> or complicated <b>grief</b> faced; the role of faith; and the proactive efforts of participants to create a balance between work and their personal life. These meanings contributed to the continued need for future qualitative studies whereby the lived experiences of Hospice employees could be expressed to assist with the development of structured training programs specific to the requirements outlined by the nature of their work...|$|R
40|$|Background: The stress {{associated}} with advancing and incurable illness inevitably causes distress for patients, families and caregivers. A palliative approach to care aims {{to improve the}} quality of life for patients with a life limiting illness by reducing suffering through early identification, assessment and optimal management of pain, physical, cultural, psychological, social, and spiritual needs. Objective: This article outlines some of the psychosocial issues in palliative care and offers communication strategies for general practitioners to use to elicit concerns. It also discusses <b>anticipatory</b> and complicated <b>grief,</b> and provides some useful resources. Discussion: There is much that can be done by GPs, in collaboration with other services, to alleviate distress and suffering in people with a life limiting illness. In order to provide support for dying patients and their families, GPs also need to care for themselves...|$|R
40|$|Literature Review: The {{literature}} review summarises the main theoretical models {{of grief and}} illustrates how these have developed from intra- to inter-personal models and from clinical to psychosocial models of bereavement. The paper explores the concepts of pathological, <b>anticipatory,</b> and disenfranchised <b>grief,</b> and attempts to identify aspects {{that are relevant to}} grief in contexts other than bereavement. Finally an attempt is made to integrate themes from the literature that are applicable to the experience of loss amongst relatives of traumatically brain-injured patients. Some useful concepts are identified, but there is not yet an adequate description in the literature of the characteristics and time course of the experience of grief in this population. Research Paper: - This research paper seeks to contribute to our understanding of grief and loss in the relatives of brain injured people. The study investigated the utility of a modified form of the Inventory of Complicated Grief as an appropriate measure of grief, and explored the hypothesis that unresolved grief was associated with poor family adjustment following traumatic brain injury. The study found that the Inventory of Complicated Grief had potential to be a useful assessment tool, with some further modifications, but in this small study, {{it was not possible to}} identify a component of grief distinct from anxiety and depression that predicted family adjustment. Critical Appraisal: - The process of identifying and carrying out the research study is discussed. The direction of the study was influenced both by clinical questions and practical issues. Factors that assisted the process or made it more difficult are described. Finally, consideration is given to the question of future research in the light of the experience of carrying out this particular project...|$|R
5000|$|Grief {{happening}} {{prior to}} a loss presents a compounding issue of isolation {{because of a lack}} of social acceptance. <b>Anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> doesn't usually take the place of post-loss grief: there is not a fixed amount of grief to be experienced, so grief experienced before the loss does not necessarily reduce grief after the death. [...] However, there may be little grieving after the loss due to <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> {{refers to}} a grief {{reaction}} that occurs before an impending loss.

[...] The anticipated grief can be from non-death-related losses such as scheduled mastectomy, pending divorce, company downsizing or war.|$|E
40|$|The {{death of}} a pet induces {{responses}} qualitatively similar {{to the loss of}} a beloved human. A large number of pet owners consider their pets as family members. Given the important role that domestic animals may have in our lives {{it is not surprising that}} the experience of pet loss might be emotionally painful for many people. Several studies report that owners with a close relationship to their animals are at greater risk for an extreme grief response. There is growing attention in pet loss literature about the function of a ”continuing bond” in relation to coping and adaptation following the death. Despite death, a majority of owners maintain ongoing, meaningful ties with their pet. Believing in an afterlife for one’s animal has been reported as a helpful factor in coping with loss. While there is much written to help pet owners deal with grief after death, there is very little information available to help them prepare emotionally to euthanasia. Clinical experience has shown that euthanasia can, potentially, complicate and exacerbate negative feelings associated with grief. ”Choice” is the key word that characterizes the modern paradigm of companion animal euthanasia and L. Longoni points out the importance of helping pet owners make informed and conscious choices. The aim of this exploratory study is to investigate the role of pet-euthanasia related issues and of death representation on pet bereavement distress with the purpose of understanding how to help owners better cope with loss. Voluntary participants (n= 159) completed a general information form, the LAPS Lexington Attachments to Pets Scale assessing individuals attachment to their pets, the PBQ Pet Bereavement Questionnaire measuring pet bereavement distress, the Testoni Death Representation Scale assessing death representation and the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Data were analyzed with non-parametrical methods. Results indicate the importance of pre-euthanasia communication. In fact greater anger and guilt were found in owners who were not provided with clear and exhaustive informations on diagnosis and treatment options and who were not involved by the veterinarian on death/life decisions; greater anger was found in owners whose veterinarian didn’t give them the proper time to think over decisions to be taken. We found greater grief in relation to euthanasia compared to natural death but, contrary to our expectations, we found no differences in anger and guilt. However, analyzing more in depth circumstances related to euthanasia, we found that timing might be important to take into account: greater guilt was found in owners who thought that euthanasia was performed ahead of time compared to those that thought they had chosen the right time. Concerning death representation, 54, 2 % of our sample believes in afterlife also for pets. Interestingly, this owners have greater attachment and higher scores in death as transition. This means that they believe not only that their pet will continue to exist but also that it will be able to remember the past life shared with the owner. Being able to keep memory of past life implies the possibility of maintaining the bond despite physical death. These findings support the theory of continuing bonds in pet loss. Although further investigation is needed, overall our results suggest that psychologist may play an important role in pet loss. Psychologists, well informed about human-animal interactions and pet-euthanasia medical and emotional issues, can become a valued link between veterinarians and pet owners. Pet loss counseling can help owners to make conscious choices, to prepare for the death of their pet and can help them through grief afterwards. Assistance and support of both during <b>anticipatory</b> and post-death <b>grief,</b> may help mitigate potentially negative effects of pet loss as anger and guilt...|$|R
50|$|How often <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> occurs is {{a subject}} of some controversy.

50|$|A direct {{correlation}} exists between anticipatory grieving and the caregiver’s quality of life.

50|$|Grief {{counseling}} may {{be called}} upon when a person suffers <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief,</b> for example an intrusive and frequent worry about a loved one whose death is neither imminent nor likely.

5000|$|Features {{identified}} {{specifically with}} <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> include heightened {{concern for the}} dying person, rehearsal of the death and attempts {{to adjust to the}} consequences of the death.

50|$|In {{the process}} of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief,</b> family members also begin to prepare and reflect on how their lives will be once their loved one passes.

These ways include: “...reading, journaling, thinking, and {{reflecting}} about how life might be like without their partner.” The journal also expands on the premise that the preparation process is not an individual process. Those who are affected by the impending death often look towards one another for support as well as others who are involved in care such as nurses and social workers (Bouchal et al., 2015).|$|E
5000|$|Palliative care is an {{especially}} demanding task for cancer caregivers than less progressive cancer because the care required for those with terminal cancer {{tends to be more}} demanding. [...] Caregivers in this situation often report high caregiver burden lasting the entire period. Caregiver distress also tends to increase as patients progress through this phase, causing a lower caregiver quality of life. Having a difficult time with caregiving increases distress caregivers face as they enter the bereavement period after the death of their loved one, whereas finding meaning in caring for their loved one may relate to better long term adjustment for caregivers. Before bereavement, loved ones often face <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief,</b> where they mourn and prepare for the loss of their loved one. Families often react with fears of abandonment, anxiety, hopelessness and helplessness, and an intensified attachment to their loved one. Upon the death of their loved one, caregivers typically experience grief, which in a minority of cases may be complicated by a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder later in the grief process.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the nature of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> {{in a sample of}} dementia caregivers, and examined the relationship between <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> and caregiver burden. <b>Anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> can be described as one 2 ̆ 7 s reaction to the impending death of a loved one, in addition to responses to other previously endured, ongoing, and anticipated losses. Interest in <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> has been inconsistent, and has typically focused on terminal diseases such as cancer. However, the issues involved in <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> are unique in the context of dementia due to the progressive deterioration of both cognitive and physical abilities. A total of 80 informal caregivers of individuals with dementia completed interviews and questionnaires assessing his or her experience of grief, physical and mental health, aspects of the caregiving situation, and the severity of patient impairment. Results reveal that <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> is strongly related to burden and its correlates, including depression, well-being, social support, and behavior problems in the care recipient. <b>Anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> is shown to be a significant and independent predictor of caregiver burden in this sample, beyond the effects of known predictors such as background characteristics, primary stressors, and depressive symptoms.

40|$|As medical {{technology}} prolongs life and facilitates the early diagnosis of terminal illnesses such as AIDS, {{the concept of}} <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> requires further scrutiny. The original concept of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> has become widely accepted. This paper, however, argues that the uncritical acceptance of this concept rests primarily on {{the authority of the}} biomedical model, which has focused analysis on the predictable symptomatology of the grief process, integrating this understanding into health care. This paper provides a critical review of the concept of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief,</b> highlighting conceptual shifts which are required if the concept is to be relevant to the subjective experiences of people who are confronted with life-threatening illness. The paper discusses the relevance of understanding the conceptual confusion which exists in the literature between "anticipatory grief" and "forewarning of loss". It is argued that grief may be the response to a loss of meaning, and that the psychological process of adjustment to loss requires individuals to engage in the reconstitution of purpose and meaning in their lives. Distinguishing between what is being expressed for past and present losses and what responses occur when individuals focus on various aspects of their future may shed light on some of the inconsistent and contradictory findings surrounding research on <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief.</b> <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> social construction forewarning of loss bereavement...|$|E

It is argued that the intellectual vision of researchers has been obscured by the traditional view of grief leading to conceptual confusion in the theoretical literature and equivocal findings of the empirical investigations. The limited view of the ’death event ’ as the only loss incurred fails to consider the past, present and future losses that may occur as a result of terminal disease.

40|$|Aim. This {{paper is}} a report of a {{comparative}} study of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> of parents of children newly diagnosed with cancer and those whose children were diagnosed 6 – 12 months earlier. Background. Public perceptions of cancer as a fatal illness persist despite improved prognosis for children. Parents may experience feelings of despair, hopelessness, and worthlessness – the most common psychological expressions of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief.</b> With a focus on developing more effective therapeutic intervention, healthcare professionals have developed greater interest {{in the concept of}} <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief.</b> Method. One hundred and forty parents, divided between ‘newly diagnosed’ and ‘ 6 – 12 months after diagnosis’ groups, were recruited in 2006 from two hospitals representative of the healthcare sector in Jordan. Structured interviews were conducted to assess <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief,</b> using the Marwit and Meuser Caregiver Inventory: Childhood Cancer. Analysis was performed using t-tests. Results. Fewer than half of the parents in both groups reported being at peace with themselves and their situation in life. Parents of newly diagnosed children reported more severe <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> responses than those in the second group. No statistically significant differences were found in responses between mothers and fathers. Conclusion.

40|$|Aims and objectives: To {{establish}} {{the potential of}} {{a modified version of}} the MM-CGI Childhood Cancer to assess <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> in parents of children with cerebral palsy, to amend the existing scale for use with the specific patient group, to test the psychometric properties of the modified version (MM-CGI Cerebral Palsy) and to review the clinical potential of the new scale. Background: Parents of children with cerebral palsy may experience reactions similar to parents of children with other enduring or life-limiting conditions, and <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> may be one such psychological reaction. While the burden of caring is sometimes balanced by positive perceptions of the child, which enhance coping ability, for many parents the outcome is damage to their physical and mental health and impaired family functioning. Design: A cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational design. Methods: The MM-CGI Cerebral Palsy was administered in structured interviews with 204 parents. Standardised measures of caregivers’ depression, stress and perceived social support were also administered. Mothers and fathers were recruited from healthcare centres and schools for special education. Cronbach’s alpha was used to assess internal consistency, and Pearson’s product–moment correlation was used to assess construct validity. Results: The subscales were each found to measure a single dimension of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief,</b> and significant correlations were established with existing instruments. The instrument demonstrated excellent internal consistency reliability and good construct validity. Conclusions: The MM-CGI Cerebral Palsy could be useful for diagnosing <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> among parents of children with cerebral palsy. This preliminary work moves the programme on to testing in intervention studies.

Using an original and a revised concept for level of ambiguity, partial support was found for the prediction that parents and spouses in high ambiguity of loss circumstances would report more <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> than those in low ambiguity ones. Contrary to prediction, a slight but nonsignificant trend occurred for parents and spouses in low ambiguity situations to report more negative physical and psychological effects associated with grief as well. Level of ambiguity was not found to impact boundary ambiguity as had been hypothesized. Spouses reported more boundary ambiguity than parents, regardless of level of ambiguity of the loss. Contrary to prediction that parents would report less <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> and more negative physical and psychological outcomes than spouses, generally, no significant differences were found between the two groups. However, using the original concept of ambiguity, parents did tend to recall more past grief than spouses. The study highlighted several methodological concerns which impact research on loss and grief, particularly the difficulty involved in recruiting participants with subsequent occurrence of sampling bias, rudimentary status of available measurement tools, and a host of potentially confounding personal and sociodemographic variables. The present study supports a view of the loss which occurs in families dealing with chronic illness as a complex process whose impact on grief, distress, and family upheaval is influenced by multiple factors. Such factors include both the ambiguity of the loss and the type of family relationship involved.

40|$|Family {{members have}} been {{observed}} {{to cope with the}} losses inherent in terminal illness by grieving. Little is known, however, about the factors which influence their grieving before the death of a significant other. This paper describes an exploratory, cross-sectional, correlational study designed to examine the relationships among general coping style, hope, and <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> in a convenience sample of 61 family members of individuals with terminal cancer. The organizing framework for this study was based on grief theory, Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) theory of stress and coping, and Davies, Reimer, and Martens' (1990) transition framework. Data were collected by a four-part questionnaire comprising the Jalowiec Coping Scale (Jalowiec, 1987), the Herth Hope Index (Herth, 1991), the Non-Death Version of the Grief Experience Inventory (Sanders, Mauger, & Strong, 1985), and a background information sheet developed by the researcher. Findings revealed that family members experienced individual <b>anticipatory</b> <b>grief</b> patterns. Women experienced more despair and anger/hostility than men. Adult children, more highly educated family members, individuals not living with the ill person, and non-primary caregivers expressed more anger/hostility. Multiple regression results showed that emotive coping and hope accounted for significant proportions of the variance in despair, somatization, and loss of control. Emotive coping contributed significant variation in anger/hostility, whereas lack of hope accounted for a significant amount of the variation in social isolation. Neither the general coping styles nor hope significantly predicted death anxiety. Suggestions for research and nursing were indicated...|$|E
