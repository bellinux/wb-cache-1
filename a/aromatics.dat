5|$|Gerrha – {{inhabited}} by Chaldean exiles from Babylon – controlled the Incense trade routes across Arabia to the Mediterranean and exercised {{control over the}} trading of <b>aromatics</b> to Babylon in the 1st century BCE. The Nabateans exercised control over the routes along the Incense Route, and their hold was challenged – without success – by Antigonus Cyclops, emperor of Syria. The Nabatean control over trade further increased and spread in many directions.|$|E
5|$|A mercury–thallium alloy, {{which forms}} a {{eutectic}} at 8.5% thallium, {{is reported to}} freeze at−60°C, some 20°C below the freezing point of mercury. This alloy is used in thermometers and low-temperature switches. In organic synthesis, thallium(III) salts, as thallium trinitrate or triacetate, are useful reagents for performing different transformations in <b>aromatics,</b> ketones and olefins, among others. Thallium is a constituent of the alloy in the anode plates of magnesium seawater batteries. Soluble thallium salts are added to gold plating baths {{to increase the speed}} of plating and to reduce grain size within the gold layer.|$|E
50|$|Electrophilic <b>aromatic</b> {{substitution}} is {{an organic}} reaction {{in which an}} atom that is attached to an <b>aromatic</b> system (usually hydrogen) is replaced by an electrophile. Some {{of the most important}} electrophilic <b>aromatic</b> substitutions are <b>aromatic</b> nitration, <b>aromatic</b> halogenation, <b>aromatic</b> sulfonation, and acylation and alkylating Friedel-Crafts reaction.|$|R

5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other <b>aromatics</b> often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E
5|$|Nests {{built in}} the open are large and untidy domed structures, built of dry grass, twigs, and other plant {{material}}s. Any leaves or thorns present in a tree may be worked into the nest. In cavity nests, the hole is filled with a shapeless mass of grass {{with a cup of}} soft material containing the eggs on the inside. When the disused domed nests of weavers are used, they are simply given a soft lining. The nest entrance is on the side, and is sometimes extended into a short funnel. The male and the female construct the nest together, keeping close when finding material and weaving it together. The inside linings of Cape sparrow nests can incorporate large portions of aromatic leaves such as wolbossie (Helichrysum pumilio), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and camphor (Cinnamomum). This consistent use of <b>aromatics</b> suggests that they have some purpose such as protection against parasites.|$|E
5|$|David and her editor Jill Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as}} the 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out her papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. Among the papers was an introduction that David had written for the projected volume, in which she said that one of her motives for writing a book about Christmas cooking was to head off the annual last-minute requests for recipes from her friends and relations. Those she had found most frequently asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and <b>Aromatics</b> in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page book. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks.|$|E
50|$|In electrophilic {{substitution}} in <b>aromatic</b> compounds, an atom appended to the <b>aromatic</b> ring, usually hydrogen, {{is replaced}} by an electrophile.The most important reactions of this type that take place are <b>aromatic</b> nitration, <b>aromatic</b> halogenation, <b>aromatic</b> sulfonation and acylation and alkylating Friedel-Crafts reactions.It further consists of alkylation and acylation.|$|R
50|$|In organic chemistry, an electrophilic <b>aromatic</b> {{halogenation}} {{is a type}} of electrophilic <b>aromatic</b> substitution. This {{organic reaction}} is typical of <b>aromatic</b> compounds and a very useful method for adding substituents to an <b>aromatic</b> system.|$|R
25|$|<b>Aromatic</b> {{molecules}} typically display enhanced chemical stability, {{compared to}} similar non-aromatic molecules. A molecule {{that can be}} <b>aromatic</b> will tend to change toward aromaticity, and the added stability changes the chemistry of the molecule. <b>Aromatic</b> compounds undergo electrophilic <b>aromatic</b> substitution and nucleophilic <b>aromatic</b> substitution reactions, but not electrophilic addition reactions as happens with carbon–carbon double bonds.|$|R
25|$|In {{catalytic}} reforming, {{a mixture}} of hydrocarbons with boiling points between 60–200°C is blended with hydrogen gas and then exposed to a bifunctional platinum chloride or rhenium chloride catalyst at 500–525°C and pressures ranging from 8–50 atm. Under these conditions, aliphatic hydrocarbons form rings and lose hydrogen to become aromatic hydrocarbons. The aromatic products of the reaction are then separated from the reaction mixture (or reformate) by extraction with any {{one of a number}} of solvents, including diethylene glycol or sulfolane, and benzene is then separated from the other <b>aromatics</b> by distillation. The extraction step of <b>aromatics</b> from the reformate is designed to produce <b>aromatics</b> with lowest non-aromatic components. Recovery of the <b>aromatics,</b> commonly referred to as BTX (benzene, toluene and xylene isomers), involves such extraction and distillation steps. There are a good many licensed processes available for extraction of the <b>aromatics.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} that a wine {{is served}} at can greatly {{affect the way}} it tastes and smells. Lower temperatures will emphasize acidity and tannins while muting the <b>aromatics.</b> Higher temperatures will minimize acidity and tannins while increasing the <b>aromatics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fruits: Fresh fruits such as apples, strawberries, {{cherries}} rarely {{yield the}} expected odors when extracted; if such fragrance notes {{are found in}} a perfume, {{they are more likely}} to be of synthetic origin. Notable exceptions include blackcurrant leaf, litsea cubeba, vanilla, and juniper berry. The most commonly used fruits yield their <b>aromatics</b> from the rind; they include citrus such as oranges, lemons, and limes. Although grapefruit rind is still used for <b>aromatics,</b> more and more commercially used grapefruit <b>aromatics</b> are artificially synthesized since the natural aromatic contains sulfur and its degradation product is quite unpleasant in smell.|$|E

50|$|An {{aliphatic}} amine has no <b>aromatic</b> ring attached {{directly to the}} nitrogen atom. <b>Aromatic</b> amines have the nitrogen atom connected to an <b>aromatic</b> ring as in the various anilines. The <b>aromatic</b> ring decreases the alkalinity of the amine, depending on its substituents. The presence of an amine group strongly increases the reactivity of the <b>aromatic</b> ring, due to an electron-donating effect.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>aromatic</b> {{substitution}} one substituent on the arene ring, usually hydrogen, {{is replaced}} by another substituent.

Phthalazine derivatives have applications as therapeutic agents, chemiluminescent materials, ligands in transition metal catalysis, and as optical materials. Some time ago, our research group developed a methodology for the preparation of phthalazine derivatives in three steps, affording halo-thienyl-phthalazine derivatives that {{play an important role in}} diazine chemistry since they offer great potential for further functionalization by nucleophilic displacement of the halogen, making numerous otherwise inaccessible diazines become available. In continuation of the work developed before by our research group, we report in this communication the synthesis and the evaluation of the optical properties of two novel thienyl-phthalazine derivatives, having in mind further functionalization to prepare push-pull heterocyclic systems for several optical and photovoltaic applications. These studies showed that the optical properties could be readily tuned by varying the π-conjugation path length through the introduction of a second thiophene unit.
