25|$|<b>Alcohol</b> <b>fuels</b> {{have less}} energy per unit weight and unit volume than gasoline. To make it {{possible}} to compare the net energy released per cycle a measure called the fuels specific energy is sometimes used. It is defined as the energy released per air fuel ratio. The net energy released per cycle is higher for butanol than ethanol or methanol and about 10% higher than for gasoline.|$|E
25|$|Switching a {{gasoline}} engine over to butanol would in theory {{result in a}} fuel consumption penalty of about10% but butanol's effect on mileage {{is yet to be}} determined by a scientific study. While the energy density for any mixture of gasoline and butanol can be calculated, tests with other <b>alcohol</b> <b>fuels</b> have demonstrated that the effect on fuel economy is not proportional to the change in energy density.|$|E
25|$|Methanol and ethanol fuels contain soluble and {{insoluble}} contaminants. Halide ions, {{which are}} soluble contaminants, such as chloride ions, {{have a large}} effect on the corrosivity of <b>alcohol</b> <b>fuels.</b> Halide ions increase corrosion in two ways: they chemically attack passivating oxide films on several metals causing pitting corrosion, and they increase the conductivity of the fuel. Increased electrical conductivity promotes electrical, galvanic and ordinary corrosion in the fuel system. Soluble contaminants such as aluminum hydroxide, itself a product of corrosion by halide ions, clogs the fuel system over time.|$|E

Targeting poor and marginalized communities that face health issues from cooking over polluting fires, Gaia currently works in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Brazil, Haiti, and Madagascar, and is in the planning stage of projects in several other countries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Alcohol</b> <b>fuels,</b> {{including}} butanol and ethanol, are partially oxidized {{and therefore}} {{need to run}} at richer mixtures than gasoline. Standard gasoline engines in cars can adjust the air-fuel ratio to accommodate variations in the fuel, but only within certain limits depending on model. If the limit is exceeded by running the engine on pure ethanol or a gasoline blend with {{a high percentage of}} ethanol, the engine will run lean, something which can critically damage components. Compared to ethanol, butanol can be mixed in higher ratios with gasoline for use in existing cars without the need for retrofit as the air-fuel ratio and energy content are closer to that of gasoline.|$|E

25|$|There are {{synthetic}} pathways {{for using}} electricity to reduce {{carbon dioxide and}} water to liquid hydrocarbon or <b>alcohol</b> <b>fuels.</b> These pathways begin with electrolysis of water to generate hydrogen, and then reducing carbon dioxide with excess hydrogen in variations of the reverse water gas shift reaction. Non-fossil sources of carbon dioxide include fermentation plants and sewage treatment plants. Converting electrical energy to carbon-based liquid fuel has potential to provide portable energy storage usable by the large existing stock of motor vehicles and other engine-driven equipment, without the difficulties of dealing with hydrogen or another exotic energy carrier. These synthetic pathways may attract attention in connection with attempts to improve energy security in nations that rely on imported petroleum, but have or can develop large sources of renewable or nuclear electricity, {{as well as to}} deal with possible future declines in the amount of petroleum available to import.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol fuel is {{the most}} common biofuel worldwide, {{particularly}} in Brazil. <b>Alcohol</b> <b>fuels</b> are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from wheat, corn, sugar beets, sugar cane, molasses and any sugar or starch from which alcoholic beverages such as whiskey, can be made (such as potato and fruit waste, etc.). The ethanol production methods used are enzyme digestion (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, distillation and drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input for heat (sometimes unsustainable natural gas fossil fuel, but cellulosic biomass such as bagasse, the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice, {{is the most}} common fuel in Brazil, while pellets, wood chips and also waste heat are more common in Europe) Waste steam fuels ethanol factory – where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid.|$|E
