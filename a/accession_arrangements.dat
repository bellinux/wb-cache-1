40|$|The Persistent Archives Testbed project (PAT: 2003 - 2006) brought {{together}} digital curators from libraries, archives, historical societies, scientific data environments, and museums, {{as well as}} IT researchers and staff. One of the principal goals {{of the project was}} to design a distributed community repository for electronic records management. Each site chose an archival collection for testing on the infrastructure, with the record types varying from web crawls, to e-mail, to images, to voting records, to reports. We implemented a distributed data management system that allowed each institution to separately manage their own records, while using a common software infrastructure. In this architecture, each site controls access and update permissions for their preservation environment independently of the other participants. Each site implemented a different preferred interface for interacting with their archival collections and linking the distributed data to holdings at their institution. Finally, each site tested one or more archival functions- appraisal, <b>accessioning,</b> <b>arrangement,</b> description, preservation, and access – with their archival collection. The ability to manage all of these types of records using common software infrastructure was one of the significant outcomes of the project. The ability to share...|$|R

The community has over 100 members, ranging from very large organizations, such as NYU and the University of California, San Diego, to the very small, such as the Rockerfeller Archive Center and The Michael Feinstein Great American Songbook Initiative. ArchivesSpace, the application, has much to offer to management of research data. An open-source, standards based application publicly released in September 2013, ArchivesSpace {{has the potential to}} occupy several points in the research data workflow: <b>accessioning,</b> <b>arrangement</b> and description, rights management, and access. The presentation will show how, by using ArchivesSpace, curators can build and publish dynamic datasets of both born-digital and analog archival resources, which will allow researchers new points of access and discovery. An example we will overview is how ArchivesSpace enables curators to build an EAD representation of a research data project that can also be utilized as a data paper online. The presentation will conclude with a brief over of the ArchivesSpace community, noting its component parts, its membership, and its contributions to the development and sustainability of the Archivesspace application.

He was appointed as academic committee member (known as academicians), Chinese Academy of Science in the same year. Despite his fully filled work schedule in administration, he held on to his own fungal research at countless nights until dawns and in holidays. In order to help the young people to improve their mycological knowledge, he translated and renewed his monography (published in 1939) in Chinese version, 400 plates including Phycomycetes and slime mold taxa were added, and the total number of the species in this book entitled “Fungi of China” reached up to 2400 (Cheng). He was the founder of Herbarium of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (HMAS), which is the largest collection of fungal specimens in Asia at present. The basal management of the herbarium, including exsiccatae cabinet design, <b>accession</b> code <b>arrangement,</b> index system and regulations for specimen loan, all drafted by him have been retained up to today (Zheng 2002). According to the abundant sources of fungi in southern China, he also established the Central South Lab of Fungi, Chinese Academy of Sciences, which is currently known as Guangdong Institute of Microbiology, the mycological research center in South China.|$|R
40|$|Feasibility of a currency board type of {{monetary}} arrangement in transitional economies of Eastern Europe is a function {{of the size}} of the country and the nature of the financial sector in a country. For very small countries where financial services can be provided by subsidiaries of foreign financial institutions the currency board is likely to be an optimal monetary arrangement. However, if the need exists for an efficient domestically based financial sector - as is likely in medium and large countries - the currency board type of arrangement appears unfeasible. Major reason is the need to restructure the domestic financial system in these countries. Such restructuring is costly and unlikely to be paid out of fiscal revenues. Hence, the need for Central Bank with its ability to create "net domestic assets" as the restructuring agent. However, once the transition is concluded and East European countries accession to EU becomes a serious possibility, a currency board arrangement appears to be a best intermediate monetary step before joining the Euro area. currency board, transitional economies, monetary <b>arrangement,</b> <b>accession</b> to European Union...|$|R
40|$|Candidate {{countries}} {{of central and}} eastern Europe (CEECs) are suppose to join the EU in 2004, June, which imply that they will face important challenges in the conduct of macroeconomic policy, {{in order to be able}} to enter the ERM-II system and eventually enter the EMU (European Monetary Union). Abandoning an independent monetary policy might entail significant costs for countries, which have succeeded in recovering and are in a process of catching-up. However those costs have probably been exaggerated, and their estimation biased by the traditional optimal currency area criteria. The main criticism against a too strong emphasis on the latter rests on two arguments. The first one is that assessing the trade-off for joining the EMU does not deliver the same conclusion ex ante and ex post. Meanwhile, the degree of financial integration will likely increase dramatically, which in turns will decrease the opportunity cost of loosing the monetary policy for absorbing country specific shocks. In a world of capital mobility, the room left for an independent monetary policy is very narrow, maybe close to zero in small, emerging countries, more vulnerable to speculative attacks than countries in the core. The second argument is more empirical. While the link between the exchange rate regime and the fundamentals is rather weak, the political agenda of joining the EU and subsequently the EMU seems to explain the choice of the exchange rate regime.

The macroeconomic objectives for 2001 {{are expected to}} be largely attained and all end-September performance criteria and structural benchmarks were met. The authorities’ priority is to stabilize revenue while creating a tax system consistent with European Union (EU) requirements. Underpinned by the fiscal adjustment, the currency board arrangement continued to anchor macroeconomic policies. The authorities remain committed to their ambitious structural reform agenda, which is driven in part by requirements of EU <b>accession.</b> Economic conditions;Stand-by <b>arrangement</b> reviews;external debt, debt service, current account, currency board, balance of payments, current account deficit, government deficit, public and publicly guaranteed, public debt, foreign debt, state budget, tax revenue, public and publicly guaranteed debt, tax administration, fiscal balance, central bank, municipal finances, expenditure cuts, national budget, external liabilities, current account balance, fiscal policy, tax system, fiscal adjustment, net external debt, tax collection, tax reform, repayments, fiscal consolidation, fiscal transparency, fiscal sustainability, external debt service, budget law, domestic financing, fiscal deficit, government expenditure, government debt, external payments arrears, structural adjustment, taxation, fiscal stance, external payments, budget deficit, capital expenditure, external loans, central government expenditure, reserve assets, fiscal discipline, amortization payments, tax rates, fiscal objectives, repurchases, public sector debt, domestic borrowing, local budgets, external financing, external debt stock, debt stock, public finances, long-term fiscal sustainability, central banks, external borrowing, budget process, long-term external debt, government budget, domestic currency, foreign loans, tax bases, public finance, short-term debt, domestic public debt, government revenue, fiscal restraint, government expenditures, expenditure on investment, private debt, tax base, budgetary process, government loans, budget expenditure, external short-term debt, foreign currency debt, fiscal targets, budgetary flows, foreign borrowing, social expenditure, fiscal position, reserve management, fiscal affairs department, general resources account, tax changes, private sector debt, reserve holding, budgetary funds, private external debt, public expenditure, debt creating inflows, official creditors, accumulation of arrears, fiscal account, domestic savings, domestic debt, government budget execution, currency debt, debt ratio, public external debt, fiscal deficit target, government budget implementation, foreign indebtedness, tax policy, currency risk, fiscal analysis, debt management, tax reforms, budget expenditures, currency composition, debt management strategy, expenditure policy, fiscal data, fiscal affairs, budget laws, fiscal issues, public spending, central government budget, medium-term fiscal sustainability, annual budget, fiscal accounts, fiscal performance...|$|R
40|$|Political and {{economic}} transition in Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990 s and 2000 s caused radical {{changes in the}} positions of the main actors involved in nature conservation {{as well as in the}} institutional and ideational setting of this policy area. Consequently, various tensions appeared between conservation of biodiversity {{and economic}} aspirations of the societies. To shed light on institutional stability and change of the nature conservation policy, this study proposes a model of policy change over time informed by a historical institutional ism, policy arrangement approach and morphogenetic approach. The balance of political capacity of actors, understood as an ability of actors to act in a particular policy domain, is suggested as the main determinant of policy stability and change. The character of policy dynamics is illustrated by nature conservation policy in Poland and three cases of biodiversity-related conflicts: two conflicts concerning road development schemes on ecologically sensitive areas before and after the accession to the European Union and a long-term conflict over management of a natural lowland forest. The thesis argues that the proposed model of nature conservation policy in Poland provides a clear and balanced perspective on the interaction between agency, structure and culture in producing policy stability and change. Methodologically it avoids the conflation of agency and structure and structure and culture by supplementing the strategic and institutional analysis with ideational one. Informed by the morphogenetic approach, the thesis sheds light on the conceptual gaps in both historical institutionalism and the policy arrangement approach. It also represents the first practical attempt to apply the morphogenetic approach to the analysis of environmental policy. It is argued that the development of nature conservation policy in Poland was an effect of a combination of structural factors, such as socio-economic transformations, cultural factors, such as definition of what, how and where to protect, and strategic factors connected with activities of actors within the policy domain. Transition from communism to democracy and the EU accession enabled civil society actors to operate and publicly demand conservation measures as well as to form coalitions with supra-national actors to mobilise and influence national governments. This, together with a rapid professionalization and changing discourses enabled civil society actors to increase their political capacity and, in the case of conflicts between infrastructure development and nature conservation, reach an institutional tipping point, starting a new dependency path of a more multi-level and participatory policymaking. The institutional tipping point has not been reached in the conflict between biodiversity conservation and commercial forestry. Civil society actors gradually managed to improve conservation status of the Bialowieza Forest but lost the struggle for the most ~ effective type of protection. This resulted from the domination of foresters in the policy domain and their alliance with local authorities. Their political capacity was high enough to maintain status quo and retain the existing policy path concerning the Bialowieia Forest. Empirical contributions of the thesis include presentation of the long-term account of conflicts related to protected areas in one of the Central and Eastern European countries, taking into account several external shocks to the policy domain caused by socio-economic transformations and ideational changes affecting the conflicts over almost a century. It reveals a political character of nature conservation conflicts and dynamic interactions between local conflicts and national level policy-making. It is argued that nature conservation policy increasingly displays multi-level and governance characteristics, and that this process has been especially spurred by the EU <b>accession.</b> New policy <b>arrangements</b> have increased capacity and legitimacy in the implementation of the European Union rules. Still, there are sub-domains which remain insulated from these trends. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
