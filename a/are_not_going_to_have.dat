500|$|When {{it became}} clear that no further stays would be {{forthcoming}} from the courts, Bundy supporters began lobbying for the only remaining option, executive clemency. Diana Weiner, a young Florida attorney and Bundy's last purported love interest, asked the families of several Colorado and Utah victims to petition Florida Governor Bob Martinez for a postponement to give Bundy time to reveal more information. All refused. [...] "The families already believed that the victims were dead and that Ted had killed them", wrote Nelson. [...] "They didn't need his confession." [...] Martinez {{made it clear that he}} would not agree to further delays in any case. [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the system manipulated", he told reporters. [...] "For him to be negotiating for his life over the bodies of victims is despicable." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1943 Constantine {{played in}} a charity cricket match at Lord's and had booked rooms for himself, his wife and {{daughter}} at the Imperial Hotel, London for four nights. He had been specifically told that his colour would not be an issue at the hotel. When he arrived on 30 July, he was told that they could only stay for one night because their presence might offend other guests. When Arnold Watson, a colleague of Constantine at the Ministry of Labour, arrived and attempted to intervene, he was told by the manager: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> these niggers in our hotel," [...] and that his presence might offend American guests. Watson argued, to no avail, that not only was Constantine a British subject, he worked for the government. Eventually Watson persuaded Constantine to leave and stay at another hotel which, owned by the same company as the Imperial, proved to be welcoming. [...] The Imperial Hotel incident affected Constantine deeply, both because of the involvement of his family and also because he was due to play cricket for [...] a team representing the British Empire and Commonwealth.|$|E

Protests in Caracas also caused clashes between authorities and protesters {{that resulted in a}} total of 64 protesters arrested. In San Cristobal, protests occurred denouncing the proposed fingerprint system. President Maduro made statements following the [...] "flare ups" [...] of protests in August and September, saying, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> even a minimum of tolerance with the protests ... I will have no hesitation in ensuring peace and justice, which is what the people want".|$|E

2500|$|Minister of Information Nathan Shamuyarira {{said the}} {{government}} would not be [...] "held ransom by racial misfits" [...] and told [...] "all those Europeans who do not accept the new order to pack their bags." [...] He also {{said the government}} continued to consider taking [...] "legal or administrative action" [...] against Walls. Mugabe, returning from a visit with United States President Jimmy Carter in New York City, said, [...] "One thing is quite clear—we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> disloyal characters in our society." [...] Walls returned to Zimbabwe after the interview, telling Peter Hawthorne of Time magazine, [...] "To stay away at this time would have appeared like an admission of guilt." [...] Mugabe drafted legislation that would exile Walls from Zimbabwe for life and Walls moved to South Africa.|$|E
2500|$|... : On 13 April, {{the embassy}} in Madrid {{stated that the}} U.S. sees the {{question}} of Catalan independence as an internal issue of Spain. On 26 September, President Donald Trump, during his meeting with Mariano Rajoy, said that [...] "Spain is a great country and it should remain united", but expressed his doubts on whether a referendum will be held, stating that [...] "I think that nobody knows if they are gonna have a vote. The President would say they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a vote. But I {{think that the people}} would be very much opposed to that." [...] Earlier that month, the State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert insisted in that the referendum is an internal affair of Spain and that the US [...] "will work with whatever government or entity that comes out of it".|$|E
2500|$|The {{director}} had {{the first}} screening of Guzaarish for the cast members and their families on Monday night. Though the lead actor Hrithik Roshan along with wife Sussanne Khan attended the special screening, Aishwarya Rai and her family were conspicuous by their absence. After the screening, the director {{allowed himself to be}} convinced to show the film to a few chosen ones. Hence he specially handpicked 30 invitees include the Bachchan family, leading man Hrithik's parents Pinky and Rakesh Roshan, Hrithik Roshan's Father- in-law Sanjay Khan, Shabana Azmi and Javed Akhtar, Deepika Padukone, Rohan Sippy, Karan Johar, Ashutosh Gowariker, Rajkumar Hirani, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Goldie Bhel singer Kunal Ganjawala, film Maker Akbar Khan, fashion designers Sandip Khosla, Manish Malhothra, and Shahid Kapoor. Bhansali told the media, [...] "What is the sense of inviting people you know <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> anything good to say about your film? I am totally against a premiere. At the same time there are people I want to share the film with." [...] According to Bhansali he already had got the [...] "big thumbs-up" [...] he needed, [...] "For me, it was more than enough that my mother liked the film. All other opinions, I'll take with a pinch of salt." ...|$|E

No, no, Mr. Audley, I'll be open with you. I saw what you were up to when I got your letter, and Fernan--Got his lesson very well, he had. And when I came down, a friend in London gave me another hint. It won't do, I can assure you. That style of thing is all very well for you spruce parsons of good family, as you call it in the old country; but we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a rising young fellow like this, with a prospect of what would buy out all your squires and baronets in the old country, beslobbered and befooled {{with a lot of}} Puseyite cant.

And didn't the little thing thrive with me, and grow strong and healthy? Yes, even you have to admit that it did, Charlotte Wheeler. And yet you have the presumption to think that you ought to have Jane's baby! Yes, it is presumption, Charlotte Wheeler. And when William Ellis got married again, and took the baby, didn't the child cling to me and cry as if I was its real mother? You know it did, Charlotte Wheeler. I'm going to get and keep Jane's baby in spite of you, Charlotte Wheeler, and I'd like to see you try to prevent me--you that went and got married and never so much as let your own sister know of it!

I see lots of young fellows not half as capable and trustworthy as he, coming and going in Washington, in such positions.
