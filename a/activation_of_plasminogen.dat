Later research on uPA’s significance in migration processes revealed that its concentration on {{the leading edge of the}} cell allows for local destruction of matrix proteins and facilitates migration.

Even with this defibrination, however, clinically significant bleeding is uncommon. Nevertheless, the venom does exhibit high hemorrhagic activity. It also {{contains a}} low-molecular-weight basic peptide that impedes neuromuscular transmission and can in theory lead to cardiac failure. This peptide is similar to crotamine from C. durrisus terrificus, and makes up 2-8% of the protein found in the venom. In general, the venom can be described as highly necrotizing, mildly proteolytic and containing a large phosphodiesterase fraction. It stimulates the release of bradykinin that can result in severe pain, as well as profound, transient hypotension.|$|E

50|$|Plasmin is {{produced}} in the blood to break down fibrin, the major constituent of blood thrombi, thereby dissolving clots once they have fulfilled their purpose of stopping bleeding. Extra production of plasmin caused by streptokinase breaks down unwanted blood clots, for example, in the lungs (pulmonary embolism). The usual <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Plasminogen</b> (Plgn) is by proteolysis of the Arg561—Val562 bond. The amino group of Val562 then forms a salt-bridge with Asp740, which triggers a conformational change producing the active protease Plasmin (Pm). When (SK) is present, it binds to Plgn to form a complex (SK. Plgn) that converts substrate Plgn to Pm. Residues 1-59 of SK regulate its capacity to induce an active site in bound Pg by a nonproteolytic mechanism and to activate substrate Pg in a fibrin-independent manner. This complex subsequently rearranges to an active complex although the Arg561-Val562 bond remains intact. Therefore, another residue must substitute for the free amino group of Val562 and provide a counterion for Asp740 in this active complex. Two candidates for this counterion have been suggested: Ile1 of streptokinase and Lys698 of Plgn. Deletion of Ile1 of SK markedly inhibits its capacity to induce an active site in plasminogen, which supports the hypothesis that establishment of a salt bridge between Ile1 of SK and Asp740 of plasminogen is necessary for SK to induce an active site in plasminogen by a nonproteolytic mechanism. In contrast with the Ile1 substitutions, the Lys698 mutations also decreased the dissociation constant of the SK complex by 15 to 50 fold. These observations suggest that Lys698 is involved in formation of the initial SK·Plgn complex.|$|E

In mixtures of Rec-pro-UK and plasminogen, both active urokinase and plasmin are quickly generated. Addition of plasmin inhibitors (aprotinin or alpha 2 -antiplasmin) abolishes the conversion of Rec-pro-UK to urokinase but not the <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasminogen</b> to plasmin, suggesting that Rec-pro-UK activates plasminogen directly. Human plasma competitively inhibits the <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasminogen</b> by pro-urokinase with a Ki of 0. 2 % (v/v). This explains the relative stability of Rec-pro-UK in plasma {{and the lack of}} activation of the plasma fibrinolytic system in the absence of fibrin. The competitive inhibition by plasma is abolished by the addition of CNBr-digested fibrinogen although Rec-pro-UK has no specific affinity for fibrin. These findings suggest that the fibrin specificity of the <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasminogen</b> by pro-urokinase is due to neutralization by fibrin of the competitive inhibition exerted by plasma and not to fibrin-enhanced <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasminogen.</b> status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> the {{proteolytic}} <b>plasminogen</b> activator {{system is}} important for the re-epithelialization of skin wounds. Keratinocytes synthesize and secrete the urokinase-type plasminogen activator, which binds to its specific receptor on keratinocytes. Receptor-bound urokinase-type plasminogen activator efficiently activates cell surface bound plasminogen. This results in pericellular proteolysis, which facilitates keratinocyte migration. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator activity is specifically controlled by plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 and - 2. As retinoids have been reported to accelerate epithelialization of skin wounds in animal studies and clinical settings, we investigated the effects of all-trans retinoic acid on the plasminogen activator system in human epidermal keratinocytes. As tested in a chromogenic plasminogen activation assay, incubation with 10 [*]µM all-trans retinoic acid caused a marked induction <b>of</b> cell-associated <b>plasminogen</b> activity after 24 [*]h, and this induction was blocked by neutralizing anti-urokinase-type plasminogen activator antibodies, but not anti-tissue-type plasminogen activator antibodies. All-trans retinoic acid lead to a strong increase in urokinase-type plasminogen activator (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor cell surface expression (flow cytometry) after 24 [*]h. At this time-point, tissue-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 and - 2 proteins were not or only slightly increased.

30|$|This fibrinous exudate and fibrin {{deposition}} is {{an essential}} part of normal tissue repair, but its complete resolution is required to restore the preoperative conditions. The degradation of fibrin is regulated by the plasminogen system. In this system, the inactive proenzyme plasminogen is converted into active plasmin by plasminogen activators (PAs), which are inhibited by plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs) [11]. Plasminogen is a glycoprotein synthesised in the liver that is abundant in almost all tissues. It is the inactive precursor of plasmin, a serine protease that is highly effective in the degradation of fibrin into fibrin degradation products (FDP) and that has a role in other stages of tissue repair such as extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, [12] <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> proenzymes of the matrix metalloprotease (MMP) family [13] and <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> growth factors [14]. The principal activator <b>of</b> <b>plasminogen</b> is the serine protease tissue-type PA (tPA), which is expressed in endothelial cells, mesothelial cells and macrophages. tPA has a high affinity for fibrin and binds to a specific receptor, which exposes a strong plasminogen-binding site on the surface of the fibrin molecule. Therefore, in the presence <b>of</b> fibrin the <b>activation</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>plasminogen</b> is strikingly enhanced, whereas in the absence of fibrin, tPA is a poor activator <b>of</b> <b>plasminogen</b> [15, 16]. This results in higher plasminogen activation on the sites where it is required, whereas systemic activation is prevented. The other activator <b>of</b> <b>plasminogen</b> is the serine protease urokinase-type PA (uPA). The properties of uPA differ from those of tPA as it lacks high-affinity binding for fibrin and thus the increased activity in the presence of fibrin. Therefore, uPA is limited in its capacity to activate plasminogen [17].|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to its preeminent role in fibrinolysis, the plasminogen system is believed to {{play a key role}} in mediating cell migration. Leukocyte migration into the vessel wall is a key and early event in the development of the lesions of atherosclerosis and restenosis, pathologies which may be viewed as specific examples of vascular inflammatory responses. The development of mice in which the plasminogen gene has been inactivated affords an opportunity to test the contribution <b>of</b> <b>plasminogen</b> in leukocyte migration during in vivo. This article summarizes recent studies conducted in murine models of the inflammatory response, restenosis and atherosclerosis in which leukocyte migration, and in particular monocyte/macrophage migration, has been evaluated in plasminogen-deficient mice.

Because these fimbrial types bind to laminin of basement membranes (M. Kukkonen et al., Mol. Microbiol. 7 : 229 – 237, 1993; S. Saarela et al., Infect.

40|$|Background: Chronic anticoagulation is a {{standard}} of care in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). However, hemostatic abnormalities in this disease remain poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to study markers of thrombogenesis and fibrinolysis in patients with IPAH. Methods: We studied 27 consecutive patients (67 % female) with IPAH aged 50. 0 years (IQR: 41. 0 - 65. 0) and 16 controls without pulmonary hypertension. Prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F 1 + 2) and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes were measured to assess thrombogenesis; tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen and plasmin-anti-plasmin complex to characterize <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> fibrinolysis; <b>plasminogen</b> activator inhibitor 1 (PAI- 1) to measure inhibition of fibrinolysis; and endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) to assess endothelial activation and systemic inflammation, respectively. In addition, in treatment-naive IPAH patients these markers were assessed after 3 months of PAH-specific therapies...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} U 937 monocyte-like cells and KATO III cells (a human gastric {{carcinoma}} line) to potentiate <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasminogen</b> by single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA), as {{mediated by the}} cell receptor for urokinase (u-PAR), was compared. It was observed that, although the concentration of u-PAR on these cell lines differed considerably (U 937 cells: 5000 receptors/cell, Kd 0. 35 nM; KATO III cells: 400 receptors/cell, Kd 0. 85 nM), the rate of <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasminogen</b> by scu-PA {{in the presence of}} the same density of each cell line was equivalent. From data generated in the presence of increasing concentrations of scu-PA, the kcat, for plasminogen activation in the presence of each cell line was calculated and found to differ by 26 -fold (0. 36 s- 1 on U 937 cells; 9. 25 s- 1 on KATO III cells). However, the Km for plasminogen with respect to the rate of formation of plasmin was lower than the Kd for binding (0. 2 microM compared with 0. 5 microM on U 937 cells; 0. 34 microM compared with 1. 6 microM on KATO III cells). A rapid transformation from Glu-plasminogen (native plasminogen with N-terminal Glu) to Lys-plasminogen (plasmin-degraded plasminogen with primarily N-terminal Lys- 77) occurred on the surface of U 937 cells (unlike KATO III cells), but this transition did not coincide with faster rates of plasminogen activation. From this evidence it is concluded that the accessibility of bound plasminogen acts to limit the rate of activation by cell-bound urokinase. The significance of this proposal is that the proteolytic potential of the cell-mediated <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasminogen</b> would be controlled by the accessibility of plasminogen for activation rather than by the concentration of u-PAR (the latter may act to localize proteolysis to appropriate domains on the surface of the cell) ...|$|E
40|$|Two murine {{monoclonal}} antibodies (MA- 2 G 6 and MA- 1 C 8), secreted by hybridomas {{obtained by}} fusion of myeloma cells with spleen cells from mice immunized with human {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (t-PA), inhibited the activity of t-PA on fibrin plates. MA- 2 G 6 inhibited the amidolytic activity of t-PA and did not react with t-PA in which the active-site serine was blocked with diisopropylfluorophosphate nor with t-PA in which the active-site histidine was alkylated by reaction with D-Ile-Pro-Arg-CH 2 Cl. This indicated that MA- 2 G 6 is directed against an epitope covering the active site of t-PA. MA- 1 C 8 did not inhibit the amidolytic activity of t-PA, but abolished both the binding of t-PA to fibrin and the stimulatory effect of fibrin on the <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasminogen</b> by t-PA. Thus MA- 1 C 8 is directed against an epitope which covers the fibrin-binding site of t-PA. The A and B chains of partially reduced two-chain t-PA were separated by immunoadsorption on immobilized MA- 1 C 8 and MA- 2 G 6. The purified B chain reacted with MA- 2 G 6 but not with MA- 1 C 8 and activated plasminogen following Michaelis-Menten kinetics with kinetic constants {{similar to those of}} intact t-PA (Km = 100 microM and kcat = 0. 02 s- 1). However, fibrin or CNBr-digested fibrinogen did not stimulate the <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasminogen</b> by the B chain. The purified A chain reacted with MA- 1 C 8 but not with MA- 2 G 6. It bound to fibrin with an affinity similar to that of intact t-PA but did not activate plasminogen. It is concluded that the active center of t-PA is located in the B chain and the fibrin-binding site in the A-chain. Both functional domains are required for the regulation by fibrin of the t-PA-mediated <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasminogen.</b> status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} if neurotensin (NT) could induce <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> urokinase-type <b>plasminogen</b> activator (uPA) in vascular endothelial cells, we {{utilized the}} acetyl-NT (8 – 13) analogue, TJN- 950, {{in which the}} C-terminal leucine is reduced to leucinol. TJN- 950 inhibited the binding of 125 I-NT to membranes of newborn rat brains and of COS- 7 cells transfected with rat NT receptor cDNA, but at 104 higher doses than NT (8 – 13). However, TJN- 950 was as effective as NT in inducing the fibrinolytic activity in bovine vascular aortic and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and enhanced the migration of vascular endothelial cells. Moreover, administration of TJN- 950 induced neovascularization in the rat cornea in vivo. TJN- 950 {{had no effect on}} expression <b>of</b> uPA, <b>plasminogen</b> activator inhibitor- 1 or uPA receptor mRNA. The binding of 125 I-TJN- 950 to cell membranes was blocked by unlabeled uPA and TJN- 950, but not the amino-terminal or 12 – 32 fragment of uPA. TJN- 950 may enhance uPA activity in vascular endothelial cells by interacting with the uPA receptor, resulting in induction of angiogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Tissue {{plasminogen}} activator (t-PA) and/or pro-urokinase (pro-UK) induced lysis {{of standard}} 125 I-fibrin clots suspended in plasma was studied. Doses were kept below the concentration {{at which a}} nonspecific effect was seen, i. e., where fibrinogenolysis and major plasminogen consumption were observed. Small amounts of t-PA potentiated clot lysis by pro-UK by attenuating the lag phase characteristic of pro-UK, and causing a much earlier transition to the rapid phase of lysis. Similar promotion of the fibrinolytic effect of pro-UK was obtained when clots were pretreated with UK or with a little plasmin (less than 1 % clot lysis). Promotion by plasmin was nullified by a subsequent treatment of the clot with carboxypeptidase B, indicating that the plasmin effect {{was related to the}} exposure of carboxy terminal lysine residues on fibrin. These lysine termini, absent in undegraded fibrin, are known to be essential for the high affinity binding <b>of</b> <b>plasminogen</b> to fibrin. In contrast, clot lysis by t-PA was unaffected by plasmin pretreatment and little affected by carboxypeptidase B treatment of the fibrin substrate. Therefore, plasminogen bound to lysine termini on fibrin, although found to be essential for pro-UK, did not appear to serve as a substrate for t-PA. Selective <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> fibrin bound <b>plasminogen</b> has been attributed to the conformational change in Glu-plasminogen that occurs as a result of binding. The present findings suggest that this conformational change occurs when plasminogen is bound to a terminal lysine but not to an internal lysine. Plasminogen bound to the latter site on fibrin was activated by t-PA and therefore is involved in the ternary complex. This initiates lysis of the undegraded clot and exposes the plasminogen binding sites required by pro-UK. By their complementary <b>activation</b> <b>of</b> fibrin bound <b>plasminogen,</b> t-PA followed by pro-UK induces efficient and synergistic fibrinolysis, whereas each is relatively inefficient when used alone...|$|R
