The waste water polluted by these effluents disturbs the normal use of water for agriculture, aquatic life. The purity and quality of water is a basic concern to mankind. So these effluents must be treated. Natural biopolymers are industrially attractive because of their capability of removing the metalions present in the waste water. Among the many other low cost absorbents identified chitosan has the highest sorption capacity for several metal ions (Deshpande, 1986). The use of biosorbent chitosan {{makes it possible to}} remove both heavy metals and organic compounds.

The binding characteristics of a range of structurally related ligands were estimated using a form of radioimmunoassay. The antibody mimics were found to be highly selective for the ligands used in their preparation and the cross-reactivities with compounds of related structure resembled those obtained in studies with natural antibodies.

The results showed that instead of the appearance of silver aggregates observed by SEM microscopy, all the obtained materials present a single absorption band centred at 430 nm, attributed to the classical surface plasmon excitation of the silver nanoparticles. The presence of silver nanoparticles is also proved by the X-ray powder diffraction XRD patterns, which show the appearance of small peaks corresponding to the face centered cubic (f. c. c.) silver phase {{in the case of}} D 100 and D 120 samples. Additionally strong interactions between silver ions and carboxylic groups of Carbopol were identified by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy.

High levels of attachment of rat osteosarcoma (ROS 17 / 2. 8) cells were observed on surfaces that had high concentrations of hydroxyl and carbonyl functionalities and intermediate concentrations of carboxyl functionality.

Pd cations {{were reduced to}} Pd metals when fiber mats were treated in an aqueous hydrazine solution at room temperature. Pd atoms nucleate and form small crystallites whose sizes were estimated from the peak broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. Two to four crystallites adhere together and form agglomerates. Agglomerate sizes and fiber diameters were determined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Spherical Pd nanoparticles were dispersed homogeneously on the electrospun nanofibers. The effects of copolymer composition and amount of PdCl 2 on particle size were investigated. Pd particle size mainly depends {{on the amount of}} <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> functional groups and PdCl 2 concentration in the spinning solution.

40|$|<b>Acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> (CAS No. 79 - 10 - 7) is a {{colourless}} liquid with an irritating acrid odour. <b>Acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> is used {{primarily as a}} starting material {{in the production of}} acrylic esters, as a monomer for polyacrylic acid and salts and as a co-monomer with acrylamide for polymers used as flocculants, with ethylene for ion-exchange resin polymers, and with methyl ester for polymers. The major industrial sectors contributing to <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> emissions in Canada are the chemical and chemical products sector and the plastic products industries. The National Pollutant Release Inventory reports that there are no major emissions of <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> from industrial facilities in Alberta. The potential for expansion or diversification of the synthetic organic chemical manufacturing and plastics industry poses a potential for major emitters to exist in Alberta. When <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> is released into the atmosphere, it undergoes both chemical and photochemical reactions. Chemical reactions include rapid polymerization in the presence of oxygen. <b>Acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> will react photochemically with hydroxyl radicals and ozone. Reaction of <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> with ozone produces glyoxylic acid and formic acid as intermediates and hydrogen peroxide and citric acid as end products. The atmospheric lifetime of <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> is less than one month. The detection limit for measurement in ambient air is 0. 5 ppb by the US EPA Compendium Method TO- 15 A...|$|R
40|$|<b>Acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> is an {{essential}} polymer raw material for many industrial and consumer products. Currently, <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> is manufactured from propylene, which is created as a by- product from fossil fuels manufacture and industrial cracking of heavy hydrocarbons. However, the discovery of new natural gas reserves presents new opportunities {{for the production of}} <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid.</b> A design feasibility study is presented to analyze the economics behind producing <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> from the selective oxidation of propane to propylene over a mixed metal oxide catalyst, Mo 1 V 0. 30 Te 0. 23 Nb 0. 125 Ox. The proposed plant is located in the U. S. Gulf Coast and produces 200 MM lb/yr <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid.</b> Since the catalytic oxidation process has low propane conversion per pass, the process recycles unconverted propane and propylene back to the reactor to increase overall conversion. The <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> is then separated and purified to the glacial-grade industrial standard for polymer raw material of 99. 7 % <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> by mass. A major challenge of the separation process is the non-ideal behavior of the components, which produces three different azeotropes: water with <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid,</b> water with acetic acid, and acetic <b>acid</b> with <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid.</b> The separation process utilizes four distillation towers to navigate around the azeotropes. After a thorough economic analysis, the proposed process is found to be economically viable. It has an estimated IRR of 84. 9 % and NPV of $ 384, 963, 400 at a 15 % discount rate using an <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> price of $ 1. 75 /lb. The process is predicted to become profitable in year 3. If the product price decreases by 45 % to $ 1. 20 /lb (the current market price of <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid),</b> the estimated IRR will be 45 % with a NPV of $ 114, 552, 700 at a 15 % discount rate. The process will then become profitable in year 4...|$|R
