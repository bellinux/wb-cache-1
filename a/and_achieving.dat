5|$|Between 1912 and 1918, Bulgaria became {{involved}} in three consecutive conflicts—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side {{as a result of}} its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army <b>and</b> <b>achieving</b> several decisive victories, at Doiran and Dobrich, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses, and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929 due to the effects of these wars, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{consists of}} setting <b>and</b> <b>achieving</b> long-term positioning advantages during the game– for example, {{where to place}} different pieces– while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These {{two parts of the}} chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play. A game of chess is normally divided into three phases: opening, typically the first 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; then middlegame; and last the endgame, when most of the pieces are gone, kings typically take a more active part in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.|$|E

5|$|His father, Niccolò Polo, a merchant, traded {{with the}} Near East, {{becoming}} wealthy <b>and</b> <b>achieving</b> great prestige. Niccolò {{and his brother}} Maffeo set off on a trading voyage before Marco's birth. In 1260, Niccolò and Maffeo, while residing in Constantinople, then {{the capital of the}} Latin Empire, foresaw a political change; they liquidated their assets into jewels and moved away. According to The Travels of Marco Polo, they passed through much of Asia, and met with Kublai Khan, a Mongol ruler and founder of the Yuan dynasty. Their decision to leave Constantinople proved timely. In 1261 Michael VIII Palaiologos, the ruler of the Empire of Nicaea, took Constantinople, promptly burned the Venetian quarter and re-established the Eastern Roman Empire. Captured Venetian citizens were blinded, while many of those who managed to escape perished aboard overloaded refugee ships fleeing to other Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea.|$|E

Kalman Magen's 252nd Armored Division would initially launch diversionary attacks elsewhere to draw attention from Sharon's operations at Deversoir.

5|$|Some {{arguments}} from moral order suggest that morality {{is based on}} rationality and that this can only be the case {{if there is a}} moral order in the universe. The arguments propose that only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of moral order in the universe, so God must exist. Alternative {{arguments from}} moral order have proposed that {{we have an obligation to}} attain the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue. They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible, <b>and</b> <b>achieving</b> the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue is only possible if a natural moral order exists. A natural moral order requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived, so God must exist.|$|E
5|$|The most {{challenging}} {{stage of the}} takeoff is carrying the speed from the inrun with sufficient height over the 'knoll', <b>and</b> <b>achieving</b> the correct trajectory down the hill. The knoll is the highest point of the hill itself, from which it begins to slope downwards. On modern ski flying hills the table is placed considerably far back from the knoll, so as to reduce the steepness of the flight curve. A skilled athlete is able to aggressively 'snap' into the transition so as to clear the knoll with ease, thereby allowing them to focus completely on using their specialised aerodynamic flying technique to maximise distance further down the hill. Athletes of the highest skill level can consistently compensate for any lack of inrun speed with perfect timing {{off the table and}} an excellent transition.|$|E

He was invited to join what became Geno Washington & The Ram Jam Band by guitarist Pete Gage in 1965 and enjoyed top 40 hit singles and two top 10 albums before the band split up in 1969. Another American GI, Herbie Goins, sang with Blues Incorporated before leading his own band, the Nightimers. Jimmy James, born in Jamaica, moved to London after two local number one hits with The Vagabonds in 1960 and built a strong reputation as a live act, releasing a live album and their debut The New Religion in 1966 <b>and</b> <b>achieving</b> moderate success with singles before the original Vagabonds broke up in 1970.

5|$|During his career, Caldwell {{served on}} the faculties of the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Oklahoma, Syracuse University, and the University of California at Berkeley, and had shorter {{appointments}} at some 80 other collegiate institutions both within the U.S. and overseas. At various times, Caldwell served as advisor or consultant to the U.S. Senate, UNESCO, the United Nations, the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Defense, and Interior, and the National Institutes of Health. Although not a natural scientist, {{as part of his}} work towards establishing interdisciplinary study in universities <b>and</b> <b>achieving</b> a greater merging of the two worlds of science and public policy, he became deeply involved in national and international environmental affairs and worked closely with several important scientific bodies serving, among many appointments, on the Sea Grant Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the first Environmental Advisory Board of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Pacific Science Congress, the President’s National Commission on Materials Policy, the Science Advisory Board for the Great Lakes of the International Joint Commission, as chair of the first Commission on Environmental Policy, Law and Administration for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), and as advisor to the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Program (MAB), and the UNESCO working program for the environmental education and training of engineers.|$|E
5|$|Skilful use of {{headwind}} {{and thermal}} updrafts along various {{sections of the}} hill is used to generate additional lift, creating pressure under the oversized skis and enabling athletes to effectively ride on a 'cushion of air'. A reasonable amount of headwind is favourable to a long jump as it {{has the effect of}} keeping the athlete aloft and delaying their descent back onto the hill, whereas a tailwind or no wind at all is highly unfavourable and tends to shorten a jump by pushing the athlete downwards towards the hill too early. In particular, the presence of a tailwind forms one of the most challenging aspects of clearing the knoll <b>and</b> <b>achieving</b> a competitive distance. A crosswind is just as challenging, as it can create dangerous instability in the air. Conversely, in ideal headwind conditions, an athlete can 'catch' an updraft along various points of the hill – which always involves some degree of luck – and use it to glide even further, making for an impressive visual effect for audiences.|$|E
