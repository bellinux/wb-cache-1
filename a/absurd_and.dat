5|$|Since then, interpretations in {{successive}} eras {{have reflected}} the sensibilities of the time. Goya {{was seen as}} a proto-Romantic in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on Théodore Géricault, best known for the politically charged Raft of the Medusa (1818–19). Luis Buñuel identified with Goya's sense of the <b>absurd,</b> <b>and</b> referenced his works in such films as the 1930 L'Âge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel.|$|E
5|$|He is also {{credited}} with the writing of A Defence of Freemasonry (1765), also known as A Defence of Freemasonry as practised in the regular lodges, both foreign and domestic, under the Constitution of the English Grand Master, in which is contained a refutation of Mr. Dermott's <b>absurd</b> <b>and</b> ridiculous account of Freemasonry, in his book entitled 'Ahiman Rezon' and the several quries therein reflecting on the regular Masons, briefly considered and answered, that response to Laurence Dermott's Ahiman Rezon. Although {{there is no direct}} attribution on the text's titlepage, it was established as his work since its publication, and it includes a poem directly attributed to him.|$|E
5|$|A man of {{progressive}} and relatively liberal ideas, Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, {{he had a}} special interest in applying science and art to the manufacturing industry. The Great Exhibition of 1851 arose from the annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert {{served as president of the}} Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and had to fight for every stage of the project. In the House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in Hyde Park. Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy their faith. Albert thought such talk <b>absurd</b> <b>and</b> quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.|$|E
5000|$|Style: Celia McGerr Regan {{described}} Howe's work: [...] "Howe {{developed a}} voice that has been variously described as farcical <b>and</b> <b>absurd,</b> impressionistic <b>and</b> airy, graceful and perceptive, lyric and literate, vivid and language-driven, whimsical and demented.” ...|$|R

25|$|In an {{open letter}} to Levy in 2009, Israeli author A. B. Yehoshua, {{formerly}} a supporter of Levy, described his comparison of Gazan-Israeli death tolls as <b>absurd</b> <b>and</b> questioned his motives.|$|E
25|$|Adams {{responded in}} the February 2, 1998 strip {{and in his}} book The Joy of Work, simply by restating Solomon's argument, {{apparently}} suggesting that it was <b>absurd</b> <b>and</b> required no rebuttal.|$|E
25|$|This oddity is {{analogous}} to other <b>absurd</b> <b>and</b> ambiguous conversations in the novel, which are circular and end up having little or no significance. He uses this behaviour to draw Yossarian into circular arguments that never seem to be resolved and serve to only frustrate Yossarian (which amuses Orr who generally chortles at his cleverness).|$|E
5000|$|The organisers {{state that}} homoeopathy is [...] "an unscientific <b>and</b> <b>absurd</b> pseudoscience", <b>and</b> that, {{according}} to their statement, [...] "There is nothing in it."

5000|$|Steffen Zopf founded No Colours Records in 1993 as a {{label and}} mail order for black metal records and merchandise. Among his first {{releases}} are Dimmu Borgir's first album For all tid and most releases by Graveland after their departure from Lethal Records. In 1996, the label released both <b>Absurd's</b> <b>and</b> Falkenbach's debut albums. Absurd's Asgardsrei EP was also financed by Zopf but released {{under the name}} [...] "IG Farben Production".|$|R

25|$|Fulgentius’s manuscripts date as {{far back}} as the early 8th century. As a {{testament}} to his popularity, a copy of the Mythologies may have been available in England as early as the 9th century. Fulgentius remained a standard part of collections of antique mythology up until the 19th century, when his work began to come under popular criticism as being <b>absurd</b> <b>and</b> factually unreliable.|$|E
25|$|Because the film's {{start date}} was delayed while it {{underwent}} numerous rewrites, Cornell was lost as a shooting location. Union College in Schenectady, New York, was used instead. Other locations included {{the village of}} Ballston Spa in upstate New York, Central Park, the beach in Malibu, and Union Station in Los Angeles, the latter for a scene Laurents felt was <b>absurd</b> <b>and</b> fought to have deleted, without success.|$|E

25|$|When {{the market}} for {{etchings}} collapsed {{during the great depression}} in the early 1930s, Blampied reinvented himself as a cartoonist and caricaturist at an exhibition in 1931 called “Blampied’s Nonsense Show”. This brought out his love of the <b>absurd</b> <b>and</b> led to his only book, obscurely entitled Bottled Trout and Polo. In this period Blampied also published more than 30 humorous lithographs, many of dogs, that are not recorded in either of the catalogues raisonné (see Bibliography).|$|E
25|$|Headquarters of the WAA was {{initially}} {{established in the}} Socialist Party bastion of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Immediately after the group's formation clearly inflated membership figures {{began to appear in}} the press, including an <b>absurd</b> <b>and</b> grandiose March 1935 claim that the fledgling organization was backed by a membership of 450,000 people in 28 states. David Lesser was named President of the organization, with Paul Rasmussen of Milwaukee in charge of day-to-day operations as the group's National Secretary.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, when Billy {{is trying}} to explain the rules {{regarding}} the mogwai to staff in the building, the staff find them quite <b>absurd</b> <b>and</b> derisively interrogate Billy on their precise meaning; at one point considering the thought experiment of a mogwai in a plane which crosses a time zone. This scene originates {{from the fact that}} the filmmakers themselves saw the rules as irrational, and some questions in the scene were based upon those raised by fans of the original film.|$|E
60|$|The fact is, as we {{have since}} been {{informed}} {{by one of the}} parties, it was a mischievous pleasure with some of the partners and clerks, who were young men, to play upon the suspicious temper and splenetic humors of the captain. To this we may ascribe many of their whimsical pranks <b>and</b> <b>absurd</b> propositions, <b>and,</b> above all, their mysterious colloquies in Gaelic.|$|R

25|$|Accordingly, absurdism is a {{philosophical}} {{school of thought}} stating that the efforts of humanity to find inherent meaning will ultimately fail (and hence are absurd) because the sheer amount of information {{as well as the}} vast realm of the unknown make total certainty impossible. As a philosophy, absurdism furthermore explores the fundamental nature of the <b>Absurd</b> <b>and</b> how individuals, once becoming conscious of the Absurd, should respond to it. The absurdist philosopher Albert Camus stated that individuals should embrace the absurd condition of human existence while also defiantly continuing to explore and search for meaning.|$|E
25|$|Another {{instance}} of absurdist themes in Kierkegaard's work appears in The Sickness Unto Death, which Kierkegaard signed with pseudonym Anti-Climacus. Exploring {{the forms of}} despair, Kierkegaard examines the type of despair known as defiance. In the opening quotation reproduced {{at the beginning of}} the article, Kierkegaard describes how such a man would endure such a defiance and identifies the three major traits of the Absurd Man, later discussed by Albert Camus: a rejection of escaping existence (suicide), a rejection of help from a higher power and acceptance of his <b>absurd</b> (<b>and</b> despairing) condition.|$|E
25|$|Oskar Luts was {{the most}} {{prominent}} prose writer of the early Estonian literature, who is still widely read today, especially his lyrical school novel Kevade (Spring). Anton Hansen Tammsaare's social epic and psychological realist pentalogy Truth and Justice captured the evolution of Estonian society from a peasant community to an independent nation. In modern times, Jaan Kross and Jaan Kaplinski are Estonia's best known and most translated writers. Among the most popular writers of the late 20th and early 21st centuries are Tõnu Õnnepalu and Andrus Kivirähk, who uses elements of Estonian folklore and mythology, deforming them into <b>absurd</b> <b>and</b> grotesque.|$|E

60|$|And he did: at full length, {{with every}} {{wounding}} epithet <b>and</b> <b>absurd</b> detail repeated <b>and</b> emphasised; {{he had his}} own vanity and Huish's upon the grill, and roasted them; and as he spoke he inflicted and endured agonies of humiliation. It was a plain man's masterpiece of the sardonic.|$|R
25|$|Karamanlis {{rejected}} the claims as unsubstantiated and <b>absurd,</b> <b>and</b> accused Merten {{of attempting to}} extort money from him prior to making the statements. The West German government also decried the accusations as calumniatory and libelous. Karamanlis accused the opposition party of instigating a smear campaign against him. Although Karamanlis never pressed charges against Merten, charges were pressed in Greece against Der Spiegel by Takos and Doxoula Makris and Themelis, and the magazine {{was found guilty of}} slander in 1963. Merten did not appear to testify during the Greek court proceedings. The Merten Affair remained at the centre of political discussions until early 1961.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} of the communist attitude towards the bourgeoisie elites in general, was the creation, {{for the first time}} in Romania's history, of a diaspora. Three individuals emerged as the most important Romanians abroad: playwright Eugen Ionescu (1909–1994) (who became known in France as Eugène Ionesco), creator of the Theatre of the <b>Absurd</b> <b>and</b> eventual member of the Académie française; religious historian and writer Mircea Eliade (1907–1986); and the essayist and philosopher Emil Cioran (1911–1996), the greatest French-writing master of style after Pascal. Fellow Romanian Ioan Petre Culianu continued Eliade's work with great success, in the United States. Another member of the diaspora who distinguished himself was the philosopher and logician Stephane Lupasco.|$|E
25|$|However, this {{transition}} {{was not without}} its difficulties, and during this period {{the belief in the}} effectiveness of the older methods of memory training (to say nothing of the esteem in which its practitioners were held) steadily became occluded. In 1584, a huge controversy over the method broke out in England when the Puritans attacked the art as impious because it was thought to excite <b>absurd</b> <b>and</b> obscene thoughts; this was a sensational, but ultimately not a fatal skirmish. Erasmus of Rotterdam and other humanists, Protestant and Catholic, had also chastised practitioners of the art of memory for making extravagant claims for its efficacy, although they themselves believed firmly in a well-disposed, orderly memory as an essential tool of productive thought.|$|E
