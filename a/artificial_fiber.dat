In September 1947, he was hired by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and worked in various positions in the forced labor system. He graduated from the Kazan military-political school in 1951. Nikolayev was dismissed from the internal affairs ministry in 1954 on grounds of redundancy. He became a mechanic at the Kalinin <b>Artificial</b> <b>Fiber</b> Factory, where he led the party organization. Nikolayev graduated from the University of Marxism-Leninism. On 6 April 1985, he was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class for the 40th anniversary of World War II. After retirement, he lived in Orsha village and became an honorary citizen of Tver in 1997. He died on 13 June 2009. Nikolayev was buried in the local Dmitrovo-Cherkassy Cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|The first <b>artificial</b> <b>fiber,</b> {{known as}} art silk from 1799 onwards, {{became known as}} viscose around 1894, and finally rayon in 1924. A similar product known as {{cellulose}} acetate was discovered in 1865. Rayon and acetate are both artificial fibers, but not truly synthetic, being made from wood. Although these artificial fibers were discovered in the mid-nineteenth century, successful modern manufacture began much later in the 1930s.

5000|$|Although VGF's {{product was}} less {{versatile}} than rayon {{produced by the}} viscose process {{the scale of the}} operation allowed for reduced prices.

In 1911 VGF bought the [...] rayon factor in Stettin, and acquired the patent rights for viscose manufacture. The company headed by Count Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck (1830-1916) had been the first in Germany to use the viscose process invented by Courtaulds in Britain. VGF quickly expanded viscose production.|$|E

50|$|In 1884 Hilaire de Chardonnet {{started the}} first <b>artificial</b> <b>fiber</b> plant based on {{regenerated}} cellulose, or viscose rayon, {{as a substitute}} for silk, but it was very flammable. In 1907 Leo Baekeland invented the first synthetic polymer, a thermosetting phenol-formaldehyde resin called Bakelite. Around the same time, Hermann Leuchs reported the synthesis of amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides and their high molecular weight products upon reaction with nucleophiles, but stopped short of referring to these as polymers, possibly due to the strong views espoused by Emil Fischer, his direct supervisor, denying the possibility of any covalent molecule exceeding 6,000 daltons. Cellophane was invented in 1908 by Jocques Brandenberger who squirted sheets of viscose rayon into an acid bath.|$|E

Hybrid composites {{can be made from}} <b>artificial</b> <b>fibers,</b> natural fibers and with a combination of both <b>artificial</b> and natural <b>fibers.</b> Hybrid composites can help us to achieve a better combination of properties than fiber reinforced composites. The constituent fibers in a hybrid composite can be altered {{in a number of ways}} leading to variation in its properties. The importance of this review can be attributed to the significant aspects of natural fiber based hybrid composites which are found to be predominantly affected by factors which include variation in fiber volume/weight fraction, variation in stacking sequence of fiber layers, fiber treatment and environmental conditions...|$|R
50|$|The ideal fiber pattern {{exhibits}} 4-quadrant symmetry. In {{the ideal}} pattern the fiber axis {{is called the}} meridian, the perpendicular direction is called equator. In case of fiber symmetry, many more reflexions than in single-crystal diffraction {{show up in the}} 2D pattern. In fiber patterns these reflexions clearly appear arranged along lines (layer lines) running almost parallel to the equator. Thus, in fiber diffraction the layer line concept of crystallography becomes palpable. Bent layer lines indicate that the pattern must be straightened. Reflexions are labelled by the Miller index hkl, i.e. 3 digits. Reflexions on the i-th layer line share l=i. Reflexions on the meridian are 00l-reflexions. In crystallography <b>artificial</b> <b>fiber</b> diffraction patterns are generated by rotating a single crystal about an axis (rotating crystal method).|$|E
50|$|The {{company had}} {{developed}} a process by 1897 that used rotating cylinders to stretch the fibers into finer filaments {{that could be used}} for making clothes. They patented a version of the Despeissis process with the addition of a practical method for spinning the fiber. They filed the patent under the name of Dr. Hermann Pauly (1870-1950) so as not to alert their competitors. The patent was challenged but was upheld. In Oberbruch in 1898 they established the first factory in Germany to economically produce <b>artificial</b> <b>fiber,</b> using a patent for manufacture of rayon made from cellulose in a copper-ammonia solution. The workforce had grown to 700 people within one year. In 1899 enterprises in France and Austria were licensed to produce rayon using the Fremery-Urban method.|$|E

In order to prevent lint contamination, workers entering clean rooms are generally required to wear an outer layer of clothing made from <b>artificial</b> <b>fibers</b> that are longer and thicker, and therefore much less likely to shed any material. Lint-resistant clothing materials include elastic fabrics like spandex (or Lycra), for which the fibers will tend to stretch rather than break, and longer, stronger non-woven polyolefin fibers.|$|R

However, in Japanese bondage (shibari), only ropes made of hemp or jute are usually used. In Japanese bondage, the rope is usually well prepared before it can be used, so that it becomes soft and easily bendable. Between bondage sessions, the rope is cleaned by washing it.|$|R
