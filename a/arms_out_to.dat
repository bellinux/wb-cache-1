On February 11, 2011 Hamilton would post bail for $25,000 and was {{referred}} for psychiatric treatment. On March 6, 2015 during an interview Hamilton would go more into detail {{about what happened in}} that situation stating [...] "I knew better than to punch a cop" [...] Hamilton had just crashed his father's girlfriend's car, which he took without permission or a drivers license. Unharmed, he wandered to Quicken Loans Arena where he began playing what he says was an imaginary basketball with exiting Cavalier fans. [...] "This cop walks over and was like, what are you doing?. I said, Basketball. He puts his <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> guard me, so I crossed him and he slipped. His partner came over like, What's going on? He grabbed my arm and I punched him." ...|$|E

2500|$|On Sunday, 4 February, at 7:00a.m., {{he arrived}} at the tower by car with two friends. He was already wearing his {{parachute}} suit. The news footage of his jump shows him modelling his invention in its folded form, which Le Gaulois described as [...] "...only a little more voluminous than ordinary clothing..." [...] (...) [...] The suit did not restrict the wearer's movements when the parachute was packed, and Le Petit Parisien described the method of deploying the parachute as being as simple as extending the <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> form a cross with the body. Once extended, the outfit resembled [...] "a sort of cloak fitted with a vast hood of silk" [...] (...) according to Le Temps. L'Action Française reported that Reichelt stated the surface area of the final design to be [...] with a canopy height of , while Le Figaro judged the surface area might have reached [...] La Croix claimed that the suit may have weighed as little as [...] The weather was cold, with temperatures below , and there was a stiff breeze blowing across the Champ de Mars.|$|E
2500|$|On January 26, 2011 (Australia Day), Buffett was {{performing}} {{a concert in}} Australia at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion and fell off the stage after an encore. A concert-goer said, [...] "He just {{went over to the}} edge of the stage, like he had numerous times through the night, just to wave, and people were throwing stuffed toys and things at him. And he just took one step too many and just disappeared in a flash. He didn't have time to put his <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> save himself or anything, he just dropped." [...] Coincidentally, one of Australia's leading trauma surgeons was at the concert and close to the stage; Dr. Gordian Fulde treated Buffett at the scene. Fulde said, [...] "I thought he'd broken his neck.... I heard the clunk of his head on a metal ledge, he has a deep gash on his scalp, which is all right now.... But at first I thought: this guy is going to be a spinal injury." [...] Dr Fulde turned him on his side so he could breathe and administered first aid. Buffett regained consciousness within a few minutes. He was then transported to St Vincent's Hospital Emergency centre for treatment and was released the next day. Buffett returned to Australia in 2012 for two shows in Brisbane and Melbourne, and made much fun of the incident during those shows. In the Melbourne show in the historic Palais Theatre in the Melbourne beachside suburb of St. Kilda he presented additional verses of [...] "Margaritaville" [...] in which he made humorous references to the accident, much to the audience's delight.|$|E

60|$|Especially {{she liked}} the Rock Wall. There was a freedom about it, a wide {{spaciousness}} that she found herself instinctively trying to breathe, holding her <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> embrace and make part of herself. It was a more natural world, a more rational world. She could understand it--understand the green crabs with white-bleached claws that scuttled before her and which she could see pasturing on green-weeded rocks when the tide was low. Here, hopelessly man-made as the great wall was, nothing seemed artificial. There were no men here, no laws nor conflicts of men. The tide flowed and ebbed; the sun rose and set; regularly each afternoon the brave west wind came romping in through the Golden Gate, darkening the water, cresting tiny wavelets, making the sailboats fly. Everything ran with frictionless order. Everything was free. Firewood lay about for the taking. No man sold it by the sack. Small boys fished with poles from the rocks, {{with no one to}} drive them away for trespass, catching fish as Billy had caught fish, as Cal Hutchins had caught fish. Billy had told her of the great perch Cal Hutchins caught {{on the day of the}} eclipse, when he had little dreamed the heart of his manhood would be spent in convict's garb.|$|E

6000|$|At seven {{the next}} morning he started in cheerfully to work. At nine, A. M., he had placed three large stones on the first course in position, an hour having been spent in looking for a pick and hammer, and in the {{incidental}} [...] "chaffing" [...] with Bridget. At ten o'clock I went to overlook his work; it was a rash action, as it caused him to respectfully doff his hat, discontinue his labors, and lean back against the fence in cheerful and easy conservation. [...] "Are you fond uv blackberries, Captain?" [...] I told him that the children were in the habit of getting them from the meadow beyond, hoping to estop the suggestion I knew was coming. [...] "Ah, but, Captain, it's meself that with wanderin' and havin' nothin' to pass me lips but the berries I'd pick from the hedges,--it's meself knows where to find thim. Sure, it's yer childer, and foine boys they are, Captain, that's besaching me to go wid 'em to the place, known'st only to meself." [...] It is unnecessary to say that he triumphed. After the manner of vagabonds of all degrees, he had enlisted the women and children on his side--and my friend, the Tramp, had his own way. He departed at eleven and returned at four, P. M., with a tin dinner-pail half filled. On interrogating the boys it appeared that they had had a [...] "bully time," [...] but on cross-examination it came out that THEY had picked the berries. From four to six, three more stones were laid, and the arduous labors of the day were over. As I stood looking at the first course of six stones, my friend, the Tramp, stretched his strong <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> their fullest extent and said: [...] "Ay, but it's worruk that's good for me; give me worruk, and it's all I'll be askin' fur." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{belonged to}} a good and very wealthy family {{of the city and}} was an only child, and lost both parents when very young. She was a very pretty girl of a joyous nature and a great {{favourite}} in society. At the age of sixteen she became engaged to a young man who was also of a good and wealthy family. After becoming engaged to her he went to the war in Paraguay, and after an absence of two years, during which he had distinguished himself in the field and won his captaincy, he returned to marry her. She was at her own house waiting in joyful excitement to receive him when his carriage arrived, and she flew to the door to welcome him. He, seeing her, jumped out and came running to her with his <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> embrace her, but when still three or four yards distant suddenly stopped short and throwing up his arms fell to the earth a dead man. The shock of his death at this moment of supreme bliss for both of them was more than she could bear; it brought on a fever of the brain and it was feared that if she ever recovered it would be with a shattered mind. But it was not so: she got well and her reason was not lost, but she was changed into a different being from the happy girl of other days--fond of society, of dress, of pleasures; full of life and laughter. [...] "Now she is sadness itself and will continue to wear mourning {{for the rest of her}} life, and prefers always to be alone. This old house, built by her grandfather when there were few houses in this suburb, she once liked to visit, but since her loss she has been but once in it. That was when you saw her, when she came to spend a few months in solitude. She would not even allow me to come and sit and talk to her! Think of that! She thinks nothing of her possessions and allows us to live here rent free, to grow vegetables and raise poultry for the market. That is what we do for a living; my husband and our little daughter attend to these things out of doors, and I look after the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|Although dazed {{with the}} awful din and almost fainting with terror and weakness, {{he could not}} resist the command. Pressing {{his hands on the}} raft he at last {{struggled}} up to his knees, and saw that the feared bird-like monster had passed him by: he saw that it was a ship with a black hull, its white sails spread, and that the motion of the water and the wave that swept over him had been created by the ship as it came close to the raft. It was now rapidly gliding from him, but still very near, and he saw a crowd of strange-looking rough men, with sun-browned faces and long hair and shaggy beards, leaning over the bulwarks staring at him. They had seen with astonishment the corpse, as they thought, of a little naked white boy lying on the old black raft, with a multitude of sea-birds gathered to feed on him; now when they saw him get up on his knees and look at them, they uttered a great cry, and began rushing excitedly hither and thither, to pull at ropes and lower a boat. Martin did not know what they were doing; he only knew that they were men in a ship, but he was now too weak and worn-out to look at or think of more than one thing at a time, and what he was looking at now was the birds. For no sooner had he looked up and seen the ship than their wild cries ceased, and they rose up and up like a white cloud to scatter far and wide over sky and sea. For some moments he continued watching them, listening to their changed voices, which now had a very soft and pleasant sound, as if they were satisfied and happy. It made him happy to hear them, and he lifted his hands up and smiled; then, relieved of his terror and overcome with weariness, {{he closed his eyes and}} dropped once more full length upon his bed of wet seaweed. At that the men stared into each other's face, a very strange startled look coming into their eyes. And no wonder! For long, long months, running to years, they had been cruising in those lonely desolate seas, thousands of miles from home, seeing no land nor any green thing, nor dear face of woman or child: and now by some strange chance a child had come to them, and even while they were making all haste to rescue it, putting their <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> take it from the sea, its life had seemingly been snatched from them! ...|$|E
