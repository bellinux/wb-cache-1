5|$|State {{law allows}} for the {{incorporation}} of a community as either <b>a</b> <b>city</b> or a town; the only additional requirement to incorporate as <b>a</b> <b>city</b> is a minimum population of 3,000. Cities and towns in Arizona function largely in an identical manner, but cities are provided with additional powers that a town charter does not provide, limited primarily to certain powers regarding the regulation of utilities and construction within the city limits. State law allows adjoining towns to merge and it allows <b>a</b> <b>city</b> to annex a town, {{but it does not}} allow cities to merge. Additionally, a town may change its form of government to <b>a</b> <b>city</b> upon reaching the minimum population of 3,000. There are, however, large communities that have remained incorporated as a town in spite of attaining a large population; Gilbert, with more than 200,000 residents, remains incorporated as a town.|$|E
