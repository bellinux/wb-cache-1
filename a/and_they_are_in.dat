25|$|There are two {{opposing}} {{sides of the}} sex education argument amongst parents: the sexual liberals and the sexual conservatives.

Sexual conservatives see knowledge on sex as encouraging adolescents to have sex, and they believe that sex should be taught inside the family in order for their morals {{to be included in the}} conversation. Sexual conservatives see the importance of teaching sex education, but only through abstinence-only programs.|$|E

500|$|The poems Wordsworth wrote {{while in}} Goslar {{focus on the}} dead and dying. The [...] "Lucy poems" [...] follow this trend, and often fail to {{delineate}} {{the difference between life}} and death. Each creates an ambiguity between the sublime and nothingness, as they attempt to reconcile the question of how to convey the death of a girl intimately connected to nature. They describe a rite of passage from innocent childhood to corrupted maturity and, according to Hartman, [...] "center on a death or a radical change of consciousness which is expressed in semi-mythical form; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> <b>in</b> fact, Wordsworth's nearest approach to a personal myth." [...] The narrator is affected greatly by Lucy's death and cries out in [...] "She dwelt" [...] of [...] "the difference to me!". Yet in [...] "A slumber" [...] he is spared from trauma by sleep.|$|E
500|$|Kinesin-5, {{like all}} motor proteins, breaks down ATP into ADP and {{inorganic}} phosphate, using a water molecule, and converts the chemical energy to force and motion along microtubules. [...] Kinetic experiments reveal rates of how fast intermediate steps in catalysis occur {{and the most}} extensive set of studies on Kinesin-5 kinetics {{has been on the}} human protein. [...] X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and real-time infrared spectroscopy have been used to measure the structure of Kinesin-5 in the different catalytic intermediate states. [...] Changes in the secondary structure, or conformational switching, is required to convert and amplify biochemical changes in the catalytic active site into larger movements necessary for cellular motion. [...] For example, the first step of ATP hydrolysis, which is the attack of the terminal phosphate of ATP by a water molecule, had not been observed by x-ray crystallography in any kinesin protein, until recently in Kinesin-5. [...] This crystal structure showed that there was not one, but rather two, water molecules <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> close association with each other. [...] A two-water catalytic model was proposed and confirmed by an alternate method to track Kinesin-5 catalysis in real-time and in a kinesin protein in a different subfamily. [...] Two-water catalytic models also are proposed in a divergent motor protein, myosin, and observed experimentally in one of its crystal structures.|$|E
