40|$|This study {{examined}} relationships among self-esteem, media internalization, sexual orientation, and ethnicity in predicting drive for muscularity in {{a diverse group}} of men (N = 217) who work out in gyms. Investigations examined media internalization and sexual orientation as moderators of the relationship between self-esteem <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity. Additional analyses examined media internalization as a moderator of the relationships between a) sexual orientation <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity <b>and</b> b) ethnicity <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity. Standardized questionnaires were utilized to assess drive for muscularity, media internalization, self-esteem, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. While lower self-esteem predicted greater drive for muscularity, neither media internalization nor sexual orientation were significant moderators of this relationship. However, media internalization mediated the relationships between sexual orientation <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity <b>and</b> between ethnicity <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity. Findings suggest that the internalization of ideal muscularized images explain demographic differences in the drive to be more muscular...|$|R

An online sample of 64 {{homosexual}} men was used to examine the relationship between psychosocial variables hypothesised to play a role in this link (connection to gay community, rejection sensitivity, self-esteem, stigma consciousness, and internalised homophobia) and two aspects of body dissatisfaction (<b>drive</b> for thinness <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity). Results from multiple linear regression analyses suggest that <b>drive</b> for thinness <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity have distinct profiles, with drive for thinness correlated with low self-esteem, <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity correlated with increased involvement with the gay community. Future research should continue to examine <b>drive</b> for thinness <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity as distinct aspects of body dissatisfaction...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the zero viscosity limit of long time averages of solutions of damped <b>and</b> <b>driven</b> Navier-Stokes equations in R 2. These equations {{arise in the}} Charney-Stommel model of the Gulf Stream, [1]. The fact there is no anomalous dissipation of energy in damped <b>and</b> <b>driven</b> Navier-Stokes equations was suggested by D. Bernard, [2]. We prove that the zero viscosity limit of long time average enstrophy dissipation rate vanishes. Stationary statistical solutions of the damped <b>and</b> <b>driven</b> Navier-Stokes equations converge to renormalized stationary statistical solutions of the damped <b>and</b> <b>driven</b> Euler equations.

He is {{surprised}} to discover that Doc Hudson, who is decked out in his old racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief, along with several other friends from Radiator Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute, Hicks, refusing to come behind Weathers again, side swipes Weathers, and sends him into a dangerous spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, <b>and</b> <b>drives</b> back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory, but are nonetheless impressed with McQueen's sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines, insisting on staying with Rusteze as an appreciation of their past support. Later, back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns and announces that he will be setting up his headquarters there, helping to put Radiator Springs back on the map.|$|E
