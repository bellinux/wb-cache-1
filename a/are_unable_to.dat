5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E
5|$|Attack by the ant Crematogaster laeviuscula is {{different}} from attacks by birds. Rather than knocking down the nest, the ants swarm all over the nest and remove the brood from it. The ants destroy the entire brood but they <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> kill the adults.|$|E

5|$|Kidney {{dysfunction}} typically develops 1–2days {{after the}} initial muscle damage. If supportive treatment is inadequate to manage this, renal replacement therapy (RRT) may be required.

5|$|After the new Burgundians realise {{they are}} not subject to post-war {{rationing}} or other bureaucratic restrictions, the district is quickly flooded with black marketeers and shoppers; Spiller is unable to handle the rising problems by himself.

5|$|At birth, infants <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> {{wait for}} their {{wants and needs}} to be met and exhibit a {{defining}} lack of impulse control. With age, developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able to prolong gratification. Developmental psychologists study the progression of impulse control and delay of gratification over the lifespan, including deficiencies in development that are closely related to attention deficits and behavior problems.|$|E
5|$|Braun was {{a member}} of Hoffman's staff when she {{attended}} the Nuremberg Rally {{for the first time in}} 1935. Hitler's half-sister, Angela Raubal (the dead Geli's mother), took exception to her presence there, and was later dismissed from her position as housekeeper at his house in Berchtesgaden.

5|$|Certain serpins spontaneously {{undergo the}} S to R {{transition}} without having been cleaved by a protease, {{to form a}} conformation termed the latent state. Latent serpins <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> interact with proteases and so are no longer protease inhibitors. The conformational change to latency is {{not exactly the same}} as the S to R transition of a cleaved serpin. Since the RCL is still intact, the first strand of the C-sheet has to peel off to allow full RCL insertion.|$|E

5|$|Examination of the spectrographic {{features}} of this star showed the characteristic absorption line shift of a binary star system. This shift is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a doppler shift in the wavelength of the line features.

5|$|Furthermore, while patriarchal {{marriages are}} one of the great wrongs perpetrated upon women, Wollstonecraft argues that a greater wrong is women's lack of independence.
