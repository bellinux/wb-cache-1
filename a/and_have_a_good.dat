25|$|Some breeds {{are used}} to enforce public order by chasing and detaining {{suspects}} either by direct apprehension or a method known as Bark and Hold. K9s such as the German Shepherd breed, have many qualities that make them applicable for the job. A successful K9 should be intelligent, aggressive, strong, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> sense of smell. Many police dogs that are chosen are male and remain unneutered to maintain their aggressive behavior, however there are female police dogs which are used for rescue, tracking, and locating bombs and drugs. German Shepherd dogs and Belgian Malinois are most commonly used because of their availability.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominant}} {{farm type}} in Devon is livestock farming, which includes dairy, lowland cattle, and sheep farms. In 2006, the {{total labour force}} on Devon farms was 23,240 people, with around 7,953 employed full-time. The majority of land within the biosphere reserve is farmland, which helps support the local economy, but is not designated with statutory protection. The reserve is therefore managed carefully {{with the cooperation of}} farmers and landowners; as the boundaries of the reserve are the catchment areas of the River Taw and River Torridge, extra precaution must be taken in protecting water supplies from nonpoint source pollution. Rainwater can accumulate residues of fertilisers, especially nitrates and phosphates. Once leached into the rivers they can affect the river ecology through eutrophication, causing damage to plants and animals. This {{is one of the most}} pervasive water quality problems in Europe. Pathogens excreted by animals can also directly affect humans when transported by rainwater to rivers and the sea where people swim. Another problem is river sedimentation caused by fine soil particles washing from the land into rivers, this causes high rates of mortality in fish eggs and can affect fish feeding habits. The Biosphere Reserve Partnership provides support to farms that encourage sustainable practices, benefit the environment, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> role within the community.|$|E

During Double Dares first year on television, junior versions of established game shows including Hollywood Squares and The Cross-Wits were developed for syndication, but ultimately were not produced. Game show executive and producer Bob Boden noted that Double Dare [...] "allowed kids to get dirty <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time in ways that really were not acceptable before that show".

500|$|In April 1994, {{the label}} {{arranged}} her {{to fly to}} London and meet with producer Tom Bailey. They recorded the songs [...] "I Want You", [...] "Fly" [...] and [...] "Just Like Honey", which was later re-recorded by Keith Fernley of Bailey's group Babble with {{a different set of}} lyrics and became the song [...] "Father's Field". Lords used lyrics she had previously written in New Zealand based on her personal journals she kept since she was a child. After finishing her recording with Bailey, Lords wanted something with a harder edge to add another dimension to her album. She was introduced to producer Ben Watkins of the electronic group Juno Reactor and decided to incorporate more rave sound. Mainly inspired by the music she would hear at warehouse parties during her stay in London, Lords teamed up with American singer Wonder with whom she created the lyrics to the song [...] "Control". Lords later commented on the inspiration behind the album's sound: [...] "It was in England that I fell in love with techno music. I was working in the UK doing some modelling a couple of years ago, and I was sharing a flat with some other girls in South London. We were really broke, and the cheapest place to go <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> night out were raves - you could get in for about three bucks.
