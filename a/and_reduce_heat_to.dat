With DI technology, the fuel may be introduced within the cylinder after completion of the valve events. DI of fuel reduces the embedded air displacement effects of gaseous fuels and lowers the charge temperature.

Bulk combustion is started by a Jet Ignition (JI) system introducing in the main chamber multiple jets of reacting gases for enhanced rate of combustion, initiating main chamber burning in multiple regions with reduced sensitivity to mixture state and composition. Coupling of JI and DI allows {{the development of a}} lean burn engine making possible operation up to main chamber overall fuel-to-air equivalence ratios reducing almost to zero and throttle-less load control by quantity of fuel injected as in the diesel engine.

Load variations are obtained by varying the air to fuel equivalence ratio from ?= 1 up to ?= 6. 6. Maximum power densities running ?= 1 are 80 hp/liter (60 kW/liter) with CNG and almost 90 hp/liter (67 kW/liter) with LPG. BSFCs are as low as 200 and 190 g/kWh and brake efficiencies are up to 39 and 37 % respectively with LPG and CNG running lean ?= 1. 65.

40|$|Small-scale reformers for {{hydrogen}} production through steam reforming of methanol {{can provide an}} alternative solution to the demand of continuous supply of hydrogen gas for the operation of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs). A packed-bed type reformer {{is one of the}} potential designs for such purpose. An externally heated reformer has issues of adverse lower temperature in the core of the reformer and significant <b>heat</b> loss <b>to</b> the environment thus impacting its performance. Experimental and numerical studies on a new concept of internally heated tubular packed-bed methanol steam reformer have been reported in this paper with improved performance in terms of higher methanol conversion <b>and</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>heat</b> losses <b>to</b> surroundings. CuO/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 is used as the catalyst for the methanol steam reforming reaction and a rod-type electric heater {{at the center of the}} reactor is used for supplying necessary heat for endothermic steam reforming reaction. The vaporizer and the reformer unit with a constant volume catalyst bed are integrated in the annular section of a tubular reformer unit. The performance of the reformer was investigated at various operating conditions like feed rate of water-methanol mixture, mass of the catalyst and reforming temperature. The experimental and numerical results show that the methanol conversion and CO concentration increase with internal heating for a wide range of operating conditions. The developed reformer unit generates 50 - 80 W (based on lower heating value) of hydrogen gas for applications in PEMFCs. For optimized design and operating conditions, the reformer unit produced 298 sccm reformed gas containing 70 % H- 2, 27 % CO 2 and 3 % CO at 200 - 240 degrees C which can produce a power output of 25 - 32 W assuming 60 % fuel cell efficiency and 80 % of hydrogen utilization in a PEMFC.

Although the newly introduced light bulb had a longer lifetime, was more energy efficient <b>and</b> <b>reduced</b> the <b>heat</b> emissions <b>to</b> a minimum, it was not welcome in the market. Due to its higher acquisition price, inconvenient shape and dissatisfying functionality, the penetration rate of CFL bulbs into the lighting market stayed low (<0,1 CFL/American household) until the mid-90s. Not even the introduction of the award winning “Earth Light” changed the consumer attitude towards the environmentally friendly CFL bulb. A market survey exposed the major problems: very high acquisition price (10,80 € in comparison to 0,55 € for incandescent light bulbs) and confusion among the customers about the functionality and lifetime expectancy of CFL bulbs. Following these problems, in 2000 Philips introduced a new brand of long-lasting and energy efficient products, called “Marathon” which promised up to 25% of energy saving during its whole lifetime (5-7 yrs). The “Marathon” series provided a range of long-lasting and energy-efficient light bulbs, all labeled by the Energy Star and suitable for many locations and different demands of the customer.|$|R

The computational model developed for this study calculates the heat, air, and moisture balances within the loft considering parameters describing the building, building materials, outdoor climate as well as parameters influenced by the occupiers. Both stack effect and air leakage distribution are included in the model as air leakages play a key roll both for the moisture content of the indoor air and for the moisture transport {{in and out of the}} loft. In order to perform quantified parameter studies a mould growth potential is introduced. By using simplified relations between the relative rate of mould growth and temperature and relative humidity, respectively, a total mould growth potential is summarized for successive calculation periods.

40|$|Current V-shaped {{stainless}} steel pyrovalve initiators have rectified {{many of the}} deficiencies of the heritage Y-shaped aluminum design. However, a credible failure mode still exists for dual simultaneous initiator (NSI) firings in which low temperatures were detected at the booster cap and less consistent ignition was observed than when a single initiator was fired. In order to asses this issue, a numerical framework has been developed for predicting the flow through pyrotechnically actuated valves. This framework includes a fully coupled solution of the gas-phase equation with a non-equilibrium dispersed phase for solid particles {{as well as the}} capability to model conjugate gradient <b>heat</b> transfer <b>to</b> the booster cap. Through a hierarchy of increasingly complex simulations, a hypothesis for the failure mode of the nearly simultaneous dual NSI firings has been proven. The simulations indicate that the failure mode for simultaneous dual NSI firings may be caused by flow interactions between the flame channels. The shock waves from each initiator interact in the booster cavity resulting in a high pressure that prevents the gas and particulate velocity from rising in the booster cap region.

40|$|Power {{consumption}} {{is a critical}} issue for portable devices. The ever-increasing demand for multimode wireless applications and the growing concerns towards power-aware green technology make dynamically reconfigurable hardware an attractive solution for overcoming the power issue. This is due to its advantages of flexibility, reusability, and adaptability. During the last decade, reconfigurable analog-to-digital converters (ReADCs) {{have been used to}} support multimode wireless applications. With the ability to adaptively scale the power consumption according to different operation modes, reconfigurable devices utilise the power supply efficiently. This can prolong battery life <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> unnecessary <b>heat</b> emission <b>to</b> the environment. However, current adaptive mechanisms for ReADCs rely upon external control signals generated using digital signal processors (DSPs) in the baseband. This thesis aims to provide a single-chip solution for real-time and low-power ReADC implementations that can adaptively change the converter resolution according to signal variations without the need of the baseband processing. Specifically, the thesis focuses on the analysis, design and implementation of a low-power digital controller unit for ReADCs. In this study, the following two important reconfigurability issues are investigated: i) the detection mechanism for an adaptive implementation, and ii) the measure of power and area overheads that are introduced by the adaptive control modules. This thesis outlines four main achievements to address these issues. The first achievement is the development of the switching activity measurement (SWAM) method to detect different signal components based upon the observation of the output of an ADC. The second achievement is a proposed adaptive algorithm for ReADCs to dynamically adjust the resolution depending upon the variations in the input signal. The third achievement is an ASIC implementation of the adaptive control module for ReADCs. The module achieves low reconfiguration overheads in terms of area and power compared with the main analog part of a ReADC. The fourth achievement is the development of a low-power noise detection module using a conventional ADC for signal improvement. Taken together, the findings from this study demonstrate the potential use of switching activity information of an ADC to adaptively control the circuits, and simultaneously expanding the functionality of the ADC in electronic systems...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEven {{though the}} LHC {{is still in}} an early phase of operation, plans are being {{developed}} to operate the machine and its detectors at up to 10 times the original design luminosity. This has {{a major impact on}} the Forward Calorimeter (FCal), which is exposed to some of the highest radiation rates in ATLAS. The FCal detector and its associated components were designed for operation at the maximum LHC luminosity of 1034 cm- 2 s- 1. However at the higher luminosities projected for the HL-LHC, operation of the FCal may be compromised. Beam heating in the FCal could lead to the formation of argon bubbles in the detector, the ionization rate will result in space charge effects that will <b>reduce</b> the signal <b>and</b> the current draw will result in a voltage drop across the HV current limiting resistors. Two possible solutions are being considered to maintain FCal operation at HL-LHC. One is a complete replacement of the FCal system. A replacement FCal would have a similar design to the current calorimeter except for the addition of cooling loops, lower value HV protection resistors and the use of smaller ionization gaps, as small as 100 microns in the first compartment. The second solution is the installation of a small warm calorimeter, referred to as the Mini-FCal, to be placed in front of the FCal. This addition would reduce the ionization load in the first FCal compartment, which would keep a larger region of the FCal active <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> the <b>heat</b> load <b>to</b> an acceptable level. The current concept for the Mini-FCal is a standard parallel plate calorimeter with copper absorbers and diamond sensors, which were chosen for their inherent radiation resistance. It is anticipated that neutrons will be the major cause of damage to the diamond sensors and the integrated flux of neutrons in the Mini-FCal after 3000 fb- 1 at the HL-LHC will be up to 2 x 1017 neutrons/cm 2. Recent irradiation tests carried out by members of the ATLAS Liquid Argon group show that these sensors can still operate after irradiation up to these levels although with a large reduction in signal...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{a number}} of electrophoretic {{techniques}} have been applied to reveal the presence of additional genetic variation among the electrophoretic mobility classes of the highly polymorphic xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) and esterase- 5 (est- 5) loci. We examined the hexokinase loci of Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis {{using a variety of}} techniques to determine whether further allelic variation could be revealed for these much less polymorphic loci and to analyze the nature of the known variation at the hexokinase- 1 (hex- 1) locus. The following studies were conducted: 135 strains of the two species from six localities were examined with buffer pH ranging from 5. 5 to 10. 0; 40 strains of D. pseudoobscura and 9 strains of D. persimilis from Mather were studied using starch gel concentrations ranging from 8. 5 to 15. 5 % and were examined for differences in heat stability and reactivity to the thiol reagent pCMSA; strains were also tested for susceptibility to urea denaturation and differences in relative activities. Major findings of the work are: (1) No additional allelic variation could be detected at any of the hexokinase loci by applying these techniques. The finding of abundant hidden genetic variation in XDH and est- 5 does not extend to all enzyme loci. (2) Evidence from studies using pCMSA indicates that the hex- 1 alleles 0. 6, 0. 8, 1. 0 and 1. 2 of the two species form a series of unit charge steps. Since the 0. 94 allele of D. persimilis has mobility intermediate between 0. 8 and 1. 0, it is argued that routine electrophoretic techniques are sensitive to at least some conservative amino acid substitutions. (3) Strong correlations were found at the hex- 1 locus between low allelic frequency, <b>reduced</b> relative activity <b>and</b> <b>reduced</b> stability <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> urea denaturation. Since the three sibling species, D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis and D. miranda, all appear to share a common high frequency allele (1. 0) at that locus, these findings are taken as evidence that the observed allelic frequencies are a result of directional selection and mutation, rather than any form of balancing selection...|$|R

40|$|Observations in the Arctic Ocean have {{revealed}} changes in oceanic temperature, salinity {{and the ice}} cover of the 1990 s in comparison to earlier data. With a numerical model we hindcast the coupled ice-ocean system of the Arctic and sub-Arctic seas {{for the past two}} decades to improve the scientific understanding of their modes of response to atmospheric forcing. The model is driven by atmospheric data from the ECMWF reanalysis between 1979 a nd 1993 and from the ECMWF analysis between 1994 and 1999. The focus of the work presented here is on the temperature rise which occurred in the Atlantic layer of the Arctic Ocean in the early 1990 s. The model favorably reproduces the development and subsequent propagation of temperature anomalies in the water of Atlantic origin in the Northwest European Shelf area and along the Norwegian coast. These anomalies propagate into the Arctic Ocean via the Barents Sea and the Fram Strait. Two warm anomalies are entering the Arctic Ocean through these passages between 1983 and 1985 and between 1989 and 1994, respectively. While the first smaller anomaly only warms up the western Eurasian Basin, the second large anomaly spreads far into the eastern Eurasian Basin and across the Lomonossov Ridge into the western Arctic basins. Intensified boundary currents during the high NAO state {{in the first half of}} the 1990 s significantly influence amplitude and speed of the temperature anomalies inside the Arctic Ocean. In contrast to the notion of a continuos warming process during the 1990 s our model results suggest the warming of the Atlantic Layer in the Arctic Ocean to happen in the form of events. The event with the largest anomalous heat input during the modeled period entered the Arctic between 1989 and 1994. It delivers an additional heat of about 30 TW to the Arctic Ocean proper compared to most of the 1980 s. In the analysis of the model results it is possible to trace back this surplus of <b>heat</b> input <b>to</b> the Arctic to an increased volume inflow via the Faroer-Scotland passage <b>and</b> a <b>reduced</b> <b>heat</b> loss <b>to</b> the atmosphere in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. We conclude that apart from the intrusion of anomalously warm water also the strong intensification of the cyclonic circulation in the Nordic Seas and the Eurasian Basin is responsible for the rapid warming of the Arctic boundary current in the early 1990 s. After a reduction of warm water inflow into the Arctic Ocean in the second half of the 1990 s, the most recent observations and the model results point to a recurrence of a warm anomaly in the inflow from 1999 onwards...|$|R
