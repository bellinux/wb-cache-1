5|$|A {{majority}} of multinational corporations find their origins in First World countries. After {{the fall of}} communism, multinational corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global trade. The series of General <b>Agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tariffs</b> <b>and</b> Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist measures that were dissuading global trade. The eradication of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped countries to open their economies to Western goods.|$|E

He opposed the Maastricht Treaty, believing that it resulted in increased German dominance in Europe. As an economic protectionist, he was also critical of the EU's signing of the General <b>Agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tariffs</b> <b>and</b> Trade, believing that global free trade would damage both the EU's economy and his own business interests.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, 23 {{countries}} {{concluded the}} General <b>Agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tariffs</b> <b>and</b> Trade (GATT) at a UN conference in Geneva. Delegates intended {{the agreement to}} suffice while member states would negotiate creation of a UN body {{to be known as}} the International Trade Organization (ITO). As the ITO never became ratified, GATT became the de facto framework for later multilateral trade negotiations. Members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains. The agreement's structure enabled its signatories to codify and enforce regulations for trading of goods and services. GATT was centered on two precepts: trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory, and subsidizing non-agricultural exports needed to be prohibited. As such, the agreement's most favored nation clause prohibited members from offering preferential tariff rates to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow GATT members. In the event of any discovery of non-agricultural subsidies, members were authorized to offset such policies by enacting countervailing tariffs. The agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures. However, GATT's principles did not extend to financial activity, consistent with the era's rigid discouragement of capital movements. The agreement's initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs. While the U.S. reduced its tariffs by one third, other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions.|$|E

40|$|The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) {{a system}} of {{differential}} and favorable trade arrangements toward less developed countries, adopted by the General <b>Agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tariff</b> <b>and</b> Trade (GATT) {{has been around since}} the early 1970 s. A primary objective of these schemes has been to promote industrialization and economic growth in less developed countries through trade rather than aid. The outcome of such programs has, however, been mixed. This paper identifies some of the underlying political and economic dynamics which led to the dismal performance of the GSP schemes of the United States in respect to the industrialization and economic growth of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). The paper suggests that the effectiveness of GSP schemes could be significantly improved if they were brought under the binding WTO rules, if greater resources were directed to removing supply constraints in the LDCs, and if developed countries granted unwavering market access to LDC exports. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} the origin, meaning and current {{relevance of the}} Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) Article 3. 8 presumption that a government measure which infringes World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations constitutes a prima facie case of nullification or impairment.

The key to understanding the provision resides in the acknowledgment that the concept of nullification or impairment can be understood in two different senses depending on the stage in the proceedings at which it is relevant. While there is an isolated indication that the Appellate Body is edging closer to a re-interpretation of the provision, it is suggested that the dispute settlement process could be modestly simplified with some amendments to the DSU.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to examine Britain's trade policy towards Japan between 1950 and 1954. This period was chosen as these were the years when the {{foundations}} of Britain's post-war trade and diplomatic relations with Japan were established. Moreover, the study was undertaken to redress the imbalance in scholarly research which is dominated by U. S. -Japan relations. Although the study does not refute the dominant political and economic influence of the United States in Japan, it elucidates {{the role played by}} other countries during Japan's early post-war period. The study contends that there was a period in the early fifties when Britain played an influential role in its trade relations with Japan. This was primarily because Japan relied on the sterling area for one-third of its imports. As a banker to the sterling area's dollar reserves, Britain had influence over the area's policy as a whole. In order to understand the reasons why Britain's influence over Japan waned, the thesis examines the sterling payments agreement talks between Japan and Britain. By studying the negotiations behind the agreement it is possible to ascertain the gradual independence of the sterling area countries from British control, and the establishment of their respective bilateral relations with Japan as Britain became sidelined. The other issue examined in the study is Britain's opposition to Japan's entry into the General <b>Agreements</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tariffs</b> <b>and</b> Trade and the factors which led to this policy. The study of the two issues highlights the complexity of the decision-making process in foreign policy formulation. In particular, it indicates the various interests that had to be taken into consideration, such as domestically the views of the textiles industry in Lancashire and those of the various ministries in Whitehall, and internationally Britain's relations with the United States, Japan and the Commonwealth...|$|R
