25|$|Cross a brook, and {{you lose}} the King of England; but you have some comfort in coming again under his Majesty, though 'shorn of his beams,' {{and no more than}} Prince of Wales. Go to the north, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> him dwindled to a Duke of Lancaster; turn to the west of that north, and he pops upon you in the humble {{character}} of Earl of Chester. Travel a few miles on, the Earl of Chester disappears, and the King surprises you again as Count Palatine of Lancaster. If you travel beyond Mount Edgecombe, you find him once more in his incognito, and he is Duke of Cornwall... every one of those Principalities has the apparatus of a Kingdom for the jurisdiction over a few private estates, and the formality and charge of the Exchequer of Great Britain for collecting the rents of a country squire. Cornwall is the best of them.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{received}} favorably in {{a publication of}} Southern Methodist University. In the introduction to an interview {{with one of the}} book's editors, the interviewer noted: [...] "Get past the goofy cover, with its illustration of Homer’s beer- and TV-saturated brain, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> analysis aimed at both TV viewers and students of psychology." [...] The book also received positive mention in The Times, where Andrew Billen wrote: [...] "I can commend D'Oh!: The Psychology of The Simpsons and Reading The Sopranos, since both shows are sturdy enough to support the intellectual studies." [...] An article at The Simpsons Archive also wrote positively of the work: [...] "The connection to the show and its events is solid and psychological points are illustrated using explanatory snippets from the Simpsons." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{critics who}} {{did not like the}} film were not amused by the film's graphic and comical violence, with Larry Ratliff of San Antonio Express-News noting that [...] "this ambitious, {{scratched}} and weathered venture never manages a real death grip on the senses." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle awarded the film a high rating, but noted that [...] "the Rodriguez segment is terrific; the Tarantino one long-winded and juvenile." [...] Others considered Death Proof to be a deeper and more noteworthy segment. Critic A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "t a certain point in Death Proof the scratches and bad splices disappear, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> yourself watching not an arch, clever pastiche of old movies and movie theaters but an actual movie." [...] Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert was divided. He gave Grindhouse as a whole {{two and a half stars}} out of four, awarding Planet Terror two stars and Death Proof three stars. Ebert also noted the irony of grindhouse films largely being superseded by many big-budget R-rated mainstream films that included a great deal of nudity and graphic violence.|$|E

2500|$|William Butler Yeats was {{generally}} critical of Poe, calling him [...] "vulgar." [...] Of [...] "The Pit and the Pendulum" [...] in particular he said, [...] " [...] {{not seem to}} me to have permanent literary value of any kind... Analyse the Pit and the Pendulum <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> an appeal to the nerves by tawdry physical affrightments." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time Hewitt and Williams decided to hold a contest in the Orlando Sentinel {{newspaper}} to get names for their new franchise. Out {{of a total of}} 4,296 submitted entries, the names were subsequently narrowed to four, [...] "Heat", [...] "Tropics", [...] "Juice", and [...] "Magic". The last one, which had been submitted by 11 people, was picked after Williams brought his 7-year-old daughter Karyn to visit in Orlando. On July 27, 1986, it was announced that the committee chose the Magic to be the new name of the Orlando franchise in the NBA. The name [...] "Magic" [...] alludes to the area's biggest tourist attraction and economic engine Walt Disney World, along with its Magic Kingdom. Hewitt added that [...] "You look at all the aspects of Central Florida, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> it really is an exciting place, a magical place." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jackie {{attended}} Hartfield {{primary school}} {{in the nearby town}} of Dumbarton, and moved to Dumbarton Academy at the age of 12. He experienced learning difficulties owing to undiagnosed dyslexia, and due to the condition not being understood or even widely known about at the time, he was regularly berated and humiliated by teachers and peers alike for being [...] "dumb" [...] and [...] "thick". Stewart was unable to continue his secondary education past the age of 16, and began working in his father's garage as an apprentice mechanic. He was not actually diagnosed with dyslexia until 1980, when his oldest son Mark was diagnosed with the condition. On learning that dyslexia can be genetically passed on, and seeing very similar symptoms with his son that he had experienced himself as a child, Stewart asked if he could be tested, and was diagnosed with the disorder, by which time he was 41 years old. He has said: [...] "When you've got dyslexia <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> something you're good at, you put more into it than anyone else; you can't think the way of the clever folk, so you're always thinking out of the box." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson pegged [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] as a {{follow-up}} song to her 2004 track [...] "Because of You" [...] and the album's [...] "most personal" [...] record, saying that [...] "once you've worked through that <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> {{love and the}} kind of happiness you hoped for but didn't really know was possible. It's a happy song. And it has a happy ending, unlike 'Because of You. She revealed that she was inspired to write it after a discussion with her sister about their relationships with their respective families. She remarked, [...] "I was talking to my sister on the phone about how sometimes girls with daddy issues don't find men like that!". Clarkson also noted that how their husbands were so supportive and loving were {{in stark contrast to the}} cliché about people with [...] "abandonment issues" [...] dating [...] "losers". She also said that [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] is a positive song, despite its somber resonance, and that she's still grateful to her father for making her want to be much more present in her family. Sonically, Jon Pareles of The New York Times compared it to the anthems recorded by U2. While Marissa Muller of CBS Radio described its sound as having a stadium feel with big drums.|$|E
