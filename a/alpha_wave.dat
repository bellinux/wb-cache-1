25|$|The {{history of}} brain–computer {{interfaces}} (BCIs) starts with Hans Berger's {{discovery of the}} electrical activity {{of the human brain}} and the development of electroencephalography (EEG). In 1924 Berger was the first to record human brain activity by means of EEG. Berger was able to identify oscillatory activity, such as Berger's wave or the <b>alpha</b> <b>wave</b> (8–13Hz), by analyzing EEG traces.|$|E
500|$|Mu waves, {{also known}} as mu rhythms, comb or wicket rhythms, arciform rhythms, or {{sensorimotor}} rhythms, are synchronized patterns of electrical activity involving large numbers of neurons, probably of the pyramidal type, {{in the part of}} the brain that controls voluntary movement. These patterns as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or electrocorticography (ECoG), repeat at a frequency of 7.5–12.5 (and primarily 9–11) Hz, and are most prominent when the body is physically at rest. Unlike the <b>alpha</b> <b>wave,</b> which occurs at a similar frequency over the resting visual cortex at the back of the scalp, the mu wave is found over the motor cortex, in a band approximately from ear to ear. A person suppresses mu wave patterns when he or she performs a motor action or, with practice, when he or she visualizes performing a motor action. This suppression is called [...] of the wave because EEG wave forms are caused by large numbers of neurons firing in synchrony. The mu wave is even suppressed when one observes another person performing a motor action or an abstract motion with biological characteristics. Researchers such as V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues have suggested that this is a sign that the mirror neuron system is involved in mu wave suppression, although others disagree.|$|E

By disrupting stage IV sleep consistently in young, healthy subjects, the researchers reproduced {{a significant increase in}} muscle tenderness similar to that experienced in [...] "neurasthenic musculoskeletal pain syndrome" [...] but which resolved when the subjects were able to resume their normal sleep patterns.|$|E
40|$|Background. Different {{individuals}} have <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> with different wavelengths. The {{distribution of the}} wavelengths {{is assumed to be}} bell-shaped and smooth. Although this view is generally accepted, it is still just an assumption and has never been critically tested. When exploring the relationship between <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> and personality traits, it makes a huge difference if the distribution of the <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> is smooth or if specific groups of <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> can be demonstrated. Previous studies have not considered the possibility that specific groups of <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> may exist. Methods. Computerized EEGs have become standard, but wavelength measurements are problematic when based on averaging procedures using the Fourier transformation because such procedures cause a large systematic error. If the actual wavelength is of interest, it is necessary to go back to basic physiology and use raw EEG signals. In the present study, measurements were made directly from sequences of <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> where every wave could be identified. Personality dimensions were measured using an inventory derived from the International Personality Item Pool. Results. Recordings from 200 healthy individuals revealed that there are three main groups of <b>alpha</b> <b>waves.</b> These groups had frequencies around 8, 10, and 12 waves per second. The middle group had a bimodal distribution, and a subdivision gave a total of four alpha groups. In the center of each group, the degree of extraversion was high and the degree of neuroticism was low. Many small differences in personality traits were found when the centers were compared with one another. This gave four personality profiles that resemble the four classical temperaments. When people in the surrounding zones were compared with those in the centers, relatively large differences in personality traits were found. Conclusions. Specific groups of <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> exist, and these groups have {{to be taken into account}} when correlations are made to personality dimensions and temperament types. There is a link between <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> and personality traits, and this link implies that there is an underlying relationship. To explain the nature of this relationship, there are two hypotheses that can be applied. One of these deals with the general organization of the forebrain and the other explains why the brain generates <b>alpha</b> <b>waves...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Alpha</b> <b>waves</b> are {{one type}} of brain waves {{detected}} either by electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) and predominantly originate from the occipital lobe during wakeful relaxation with closed eyes. <b>Alpha</b> <b>waves</b> are reduced with open eyes, drowsiness and sleep. Historically, they were thought to represent {{the activity of the}} visual cortex in an idle state.

40|$|Both {{intuitively}} {{and according}} to similarity-based theories of induction, relevant evidence raises argument strength when it is positive and lowers it when it is negative. Three experiments test the hypothesis that argument strength can actually increase when negative evidence is introduced. Two kinds of argument were compared through forced choice or sequential evaluation: single positive arguments (e. g., Shostakovich’s music causes <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> in the brain, therefore Bach’s music causes <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> in the brain) and double mixed arguments (e. g., Shostakovich’s music causes <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> in the brain, X’s music DOES NOT, therefore Bach’s music causes <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> in the brain). Negative evidence in the second premise lowered credence when it applied to an item X from the same subcategory (e. g., Haydn) and raised it when it applied to a different subcategory (e. g., AC/DC).

Releases such A Distant Signal and Terra have more ambient space elements than other <b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement releases. Beyond Silence has more space rock elements and has a more rhythmic feel in their overall music compositions. In 2007 <b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement released The Mystic & The Machine, a musical exploration of 1970's era romantic progressive rock performed on synthesizers with the addition of UK musician Steve Hillman on electric guitar. The influences of Genesis, Ozric Tentacles (1980s era), and Camel are quite obvious and intended and shows yet another side of <b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement's composition. <b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement's music is semi electronic-based, utilizing digital synthesizers and MIDI to create its sonic explorations. Aside from the music influences nature and natural landscapes are a continuous source of inspiration for compositions. <b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement has performed at the Ambient Ping Canada and at the Gathering Room USA. <b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement has released music on the Dutch label Groove Unlimited, Silent Records (USA), Waveform Records (USA), Spiralight (USA), Anodize (USA)and on the private label Harmonic Resonance Recordings. <b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement's other projects include Thought Guild, Open Canvas, Subtle Shift and a solo release as Gregory Kyryluk.The latest release from <b>Alpha</b> <b>Wave</b> Movement is entitled [...] "Soniq Variants"(2011). The release is based conceptually on the use of Ensoniq synthesizers solely for the compositions. Ensoniq was an American manufacturer that spearheaded early affordable synthesizer workstation's the first of which was the ESQ-1 in 1986. Music on this release was composed primarily on the ESQ-1, VFX-SD, SQ-R and a DP4 all of which were made by Ensoniq. Additional use of a Novation synthesizer was also incorporated to add some timbral variation.The year 2012 arrived with a new electronic music project by Gregory Kyryluk under the alias of Subtle Shift. This new project dives head into the ambient dub waterways. Featuring a more sublime percussive foundation, environmental soundscapes. Drawn on the influences of the Detroit and European creative pioneering spirits such as Rod Modell and Yagya, GAS as well as incorporating 1970s electro aesthetics. To date there are four full length releases by Within Reason on the Anodize and Harmonic Resonance Recording labels.In 2014 {{the electronic}}a world fusion project Open Canvas(essentially Gregory Kyryluk) had a track from the Waveform Records release [...] "Indumani" [...] featured in the internationally popular gothic horror show True Blood.

40|$|The {{electroencephalogram}} recordings {{from human}} scalp are analysed {{in the framework}} of recent methods of nonlinear dynamics. Three stages of brain activity are considered: the <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> (eyes closed), the deep sleep (stage four) and the Creutzfeld-Jakob coma. Two dynamical parameters of the attractors are evaluated. These are the Lyapunov exponents, which measure the divergence or convergence of trajectories in phase space and the Kolmogorov or metric entropy, whose inverse gives the mean predicting time of a given EEG signal. In all the stages considered, the results reveal the presence of at least two positive Lyapunov exponents, which are the footprints of chaos. This number increases to three positive exponents in the case of <b>alpha</b> <b>waves,</b> indicating that although for very short episodes the <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> seem extremely coherent, the variability of the brain increases markedly over larger periods of activity. The degree of entropy/chaos increases from coma to deep sleep and then to <b>alpha</b> <b>waves.</b> The large predicting time observed for deep sleep suggests that these waves are related to a slow rate of information processing. The predicting time of the <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> is much smaller, indicating a rapid loss of information. Finally, {{with the help of the}} Lyapunov exponents, the attractor's dimensions are evaluated using two different conjectures and compared to values obtained previously by the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} recently that {{the influence of the}} neuro-magnetic field should make electrical brain activity directly detectable by MRI. To test this hypothesis, we performed combined EEG-MRI experiments which aim to localize the neuronal current sources of <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> (8 - 12 Hz), {{one of the most prominent}} EEG phenomena in humans. A detailed analysis of cross-spectral coherence between simultaneously recorded EEG and MRI time series revealed no sign of <b>alpha</b> <b>waves.</b> Instead the EEG-MRI approach was found to be hampered by artefacts due to cardiac pulsation, which extend into the frequency band of <b>alpha</b> <b>waves.</b> Separate brain displacement mapping experiments confirmed that not only the EEG but also the MRI signal is confounded by harmonics of the cardiac frequency even at 10 Hz and beyond. This well-known ballistocardiogram artefact cannot be avoided or eliminated entirely by available signal processing techniques. Therefore we must conclude that current EEG-MRI methodology based on correlation analysis lacks not only the sensitivity but also the specificity required for the reliable detection of <b>alpha</b> <b>waves...</b>|$|R

40|$|When {{the eyes}} are closed the visual cortex generates high-amplitude {{oscillations}} in the alpha frequency range (8 to 13 Hz) which can be recorded on an electroencephalogram (EEG). This low input state is thought to reflect cortical idling. Here I propose that in fact the opposite is correct: large oscillation amplitudes reflect a state of alertness, that is high sensitivity in the visual system, preparing it to respond to weak stimuli. Opening the eyes reduces the amplitudes of the alpha oscillations (Berger effect). This is at least partly due to light adaptation indicating a loss of sensitivity. This relatively slow (compared to 10 Hz alpha frequency) light adaptation with a time constant of some 300 ms is the nonlinear component in the alpha EEG. Brain oscillations are commonly thought to be generated by (nonlinear) oscillators. I propose that - as occasionally suggested - <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> basically are {{the outcome of a}} linear process such as band-pass filtering. I demonstrate that the superposition law holds (which defines linearity of a system) : evoked potentials are just superimposed on on-going <b>alpha</b> <b>waves.</b> The phase of the latter is not affected. The results are in agreement with the view that <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> and the 10 Hz components of visually evoked potentials are generated by the same linear mechanism. The linearity of the <b>alpha</b> <b>waves</b> generating mechanism implies that visual input cannot modify the phase of on- going <b>alpha</b> <b>waves.</b> If the same is also true for gamma oscillations, theories on brain oscillations which imply phase resetting by visual input (temporal correlation hypothesis) are questioned...|$|R
