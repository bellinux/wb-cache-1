The Italians conducted no fewer than eighty air raids on Pola between 1915 and 1917 which undoubtedly kept the crews of her anti-aircraft guns busy.|$|E

Highlights of the training period included <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> <b>from</b> President John F. Kennedy on September 11.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} (28 November), the French Emperor {{requested}} a personal interview with Alexander I and received <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> <b>from</b> the Tsar's most impetuous aide, Count Dolgorouki. The meeting was {{another part of}} the trap, as Napoleon intentionally expressed anxiety and hesitation to his opponents. Dolgorouki reported to the Tsar an additional indication of French weakness.|$|E
5|$|Though {{she would}} remain in port for another three years, Prinz Eugens stay in Pola was enlivened by <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> <b>from</b> the new Emperor Karl I on 15 December 1916 and another by the German Kaiser Wilhelm II on 12 December 1917 during his {{inspection}} of the German submarine base in the port city. The Italian Air Force conducted at least eighty air raids on Pola between 1915 and 1917 which probably kept the crews of her anti-aircraft guns busy.|$|E

5|$|Wagga has {{captured}} the interest of writers, novelists and songwriters over the years. Specifically the city's international notoriety surrounding Arthur Orton and the Tichborne Case attracted <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> <b>from</b> Mark Twain when he visited Australia in the 1890s.

5|$|Windsor Castle {{continued}} to be favoured by monarchs in the 15th century, despite England beginning to slip into increasing political violence. Henry IV seized the castle during his coup in 1399, although failing to catch Richard II, who had escaped to London. Under Henry V, the castle hosted <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> <b>from</b> the Holy Roman Emperor in 1417, a massive diplomatic event that stretched the accommodation of the castle to its limits.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} {{astronomer}} Steven J. Dick at the United States Naval Observatory considered the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact by analyzing events of similar {{significance in the}} history of science. The study argues that the impact would be most strongly influenced by the information content of the message received, if any. It distinguishes short-term and long-term impact. Seeing radio-based contact as a more plausible scenario than <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> <b>from</b> extraterrestrial spacecraft, the study rejects the commonly stated analogy of European colonization of the Americas as an accurate model for information-only contact, preferring events of profound scientific significance, such as the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions, as more predictive of how humanity might be impacted by extraterrestrial contact.|$|E

5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> <b>from</b> his sick mother, Arletta (Jo Van Fleet), Luke {{becomes more}} optimistic about his situation. He {{continually}} confronts the Captain and the guards, and {{his sense of}} humor and independence prove to be both contagious and inspiring to the other prisoners. Luke's struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than one day. The other prisoners start to idolize him after he makes and wins a spur-of-the moment bet that he can eat fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour.|$|E
5|$|Arjona was {{a talented}} {{basketball}} player {{who played for}} Leones de Marte and TRIAS. He toured Central America {{as a member of}} the Guatemala national basketball team. Until recently, he held the record for the most points scored (78) in a single game by a Guatemalan. He also taught at a primary school (called Santa Elena III), where he claimed to have spent six hours giving lessons and the rest of the day playing soccer. This earned him <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> <b>from</b> a Ministry of Education representative, who was sent to evaluate his pupils. The representative found that the students' education was actually above average. In 1988, he became the basketball coach of a boys' school (called Instituto Don Bosco).|$|E
5|$|Between 9:00am and 11:00am, about 100,000people {{gathered}} on the Adam Mickiewicz Square {{in front of the}} Imperial Castle in Poznań, surrounded by buildings occupied by the city and Party authorities and police headquarters. The demonstrators demanded lower food prices, wage increases and the revocation of some recent changes in the law that had eroded workers' conditions. They further requested <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> <b>from</b> Polish Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz, as the local government declared that they had no authority to solve the problems. Some police officers also joined the crowd.|$|E

5|$|During the {{following}} week Kioe Gie and his wife sell their belongings and prepare {{to move back to}} Cicuruk. This departure is delayed by <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> <b>from</b> Kioe Lie, who reveals that he will be marrying Tam Bing's widow Tan Houw Nio– Tam Bing having died the year before. Kioe Gie is horrified, both because the widow has the same surname and because Kioe Lie had promised their father on his deathbed to marry Hap Nio. After an extensive argument, Kioe Lie disowns his brother and leaves.|$|E
5|$|How {{great the}} glory of Origen was, appears {{from the fact that}} Firmilianus, bishop of Cæsarea, with all the Cappadocian bishops, sought <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> <b>from</b> him, and entertained him for a long while. Sometime afterwards, going to Palestine to visit the holy places, he came to Cæsarea and was {{instructed}} at length by Origen in the Holy Scriptures. It appears also from the fact that he went to Antioch, on the request of Mammaea, mother of the Emperor Alexander, and a woman religiously disposed, and was there held in great honour, and sent letters to the Emperor Philip, who was the first among the Roman rulers, to become a Christian, and to his mother, letters which are still extant.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the College Walk festivities {{is one of}} Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log.

A troop of students dressed as Continental Army soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sun-dial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols. The Christmas ceremony {{is accompanied by a}} reading of <b>A</b> <b>Visit</b> <b>From</b> St. Nicholas by Clement Clarke Moore and Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus by Francis Pharcellus Church.|$|E
