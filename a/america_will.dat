In 250 million years, North <b>America</b> <b>will</b> collide with Africa while South <b>America</b> <b>will</b> wrap around {{the southern tip of}} Africa. The result will be the formation of a new supercontinent (sometimes called Pangaea Ultima), with the Pacific Ocean stretching across half the planet. The continent of Antarctica will reverse direction and return to the South Pole, building up a new ice cap.|$|E

25|$|The {{passage of}} the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010 may also provide new {{healthcare}} options for the homeless in the United States, particularly through the optional expansion of Medicaid.

There were an estimated 57,849 homeless veterans estimated in the United States during January 2013, or 12 percent of all homeless adults. Just under 8 percent of homeless U.S. veterans are female. Texas, California and Florida have the highest numbers of unaccompanied homeless youth {{under the age of}} 18, comprising 58% of the total homeless under 18 youth population.

25|$|Estimates {{have changed}} over time of {{the rate at which}} β-carotene is {{converted}} to vitamin A in the human body. An early estimate of 6:1 was revised to 12:1 and from recent studies and experimental trials carried out in developing nations it was revised again to 21:1. The implication of the reduced estimate is that larger quantities of β-carotene are needed to yield the necessary dietary requirement of vitamin A. This means that more continents are affected by the deficiency of vitamin A than was previously thought. Changing dietary choices in Africa, Asia, and South <b>America</b> <b>will</b> not be sufficient, and agricultural practices on those continents will need to change.|$|E
25|$|On May 3, 2006, Chen {{canceled}} {{plans to}} pass through the United States on his way to Latin America. He was hoping to stop by either San Francisco or New York City to refuel and stay overnight, but the US refused his request instead limiting him to a brief refuelling stopover in Anchorage, Alaska where Chen {{would not be allowed to}} step off the plane. Chen and Taiwan saw this as a snub and led to Chen's cancellation. The trip to Latin <b>America</b> <b>will</b> continue, however, without a US stopover. The US State Department claimed that the Alaska stopover offer was consistent with its previous accommodations. However, former Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui was granted a visit to Cornell University eleven years ago. More recently, in addition, Taiwan's leaders have in general been granted permission to stopover in the United States for brief periods before continuing on to other countries. This recent American stance is interpreted by Taiwan to be an expression of the increasing irritation the United States feels towards Taiwan and Chen's seemingly pro-independence gestures. Chen attended the inauguration of Óscar Arias, the president of Costa Rica, one of the few countries that recognized the Republic of China at that time. Laura Bush was also present to represent U.S. president George W. Bush. Chen seized the opportunity, approached her and shook her hands, while Chen's aide produced a camera immediately for an impromptu photo-op. Chen's supporters saw this act as a step forward in Taiwan's struggle for diplomatic recognition, while his detractors claimed that it was a grave breach of international etiquette and put Taiwan to shame.|$|E

500|$|To {{some critics}} McGregor's exceptionalism helps Marching Men {{read as a}} proletarian novel, while others see in it an {{antecedent}} to the grotesqueness {{of the characters in}} Anderson's 1919 short story cycle, Winesburg, Ohio. To biographer John Earl Bassett, McGregor represents, in part, the author's disdain and fear for parts of modern American life, [...] "...that <b>America</b> <b>will</b> breed Beaut McGregors—talented, charismatic, romantic, cruel—who will use their powers to achieve frightening goals". Combining the ideas of an exceptional leader and unified workers has raised questions among critics concerning the parallels between the [...] "militaristic impulse" [...] in Marching Men and the fascism of the WWII-era, a charge Anderson acknowledged in his posthumously-published Memoirs.|$|E

[...] The author identifies the press as a key figure in the tenor of the 2016 campaign, [...] "The public hates us reporters in the best of times. But the summer of Trump could easily turn into an Alamo moment for the press." [...] Taibbi comes to the view that members of the press should spend more time hearing out the viewpoints of the American populace, writing, [...] "Just like the politicians our job was to listen, and we talked instead.

[...] Within months, [...] "both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.–DPRK Agreed Framework of October 1994." [...] North Korea's October 9, 2006, detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bush's foreign policy, which centered for both terms of his presidency on [...] " [...] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world". Bush condemned North Korea's position, reaffirmed his commitment to [...] "a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula", and stated that [...] "transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities {{would be considered a}} grave threat to the United States", for which North Korea would be held accountable. On May 7, 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account. This was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the United States and including China. On September 2, 2007, North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all of its nuclear programs by the end of 2007. By May 2009, North Korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack South Korea.|$|E
