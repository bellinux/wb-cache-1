The resource has a location, a value, and a descriptor. All three can change in time. In the second half, we consider a network of <b>automatic</b> <b>personal</b> assistants that exchange resources, either immediately, or at a certain moment in the future. In practice, this means that the personal assistant book time-slots with other assistants. We show that a network of such assistants will continue operating without deadlock if the personal assistants can buy and sell time-slots in a free market with inflation and discount on bankruptcy. We found that this strategy is robust. 1. Stable strategies In this work, we describe a stable strategy for a realistic large scale distributed system. This system consists of <b>automatic</b> <b>personal</b> assistants (PA's) that can book time-slots in each other's diaries, and that have to pay for doing so. Stability of st [...] ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>personal</b> {{identification}} {{has become}} an important issue in several applications, such as physical buildings and information systems. Nowadays, biometric techniques are an important and effective solution for <b>automatic</b> <b>personal</b> identification. One {{of the most popular}} biometric systems is based on the hand due to its ease of use. Hand has several modalities to be extracted, among them, Finger-Knuckle-Print (FKP) and PaLMprint (PLM), has attracted an increasing amount of attention. This paper investigates these modalities for elaborating an efficient multimodal biometric identification system. For that, the texture information of FKP and PLM is characterized by the Local Binary Pattern (LBP). During the matching phase, an Euclidian distance score is employed to measure the similarity between templates. The proposed system is tested and evaluated using a database of 165 users. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed system, which brings high identification accuracy rate...|$|R

Using cross-sectional data from the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing, this study investigated the proportion of self-reported users of <b>personal</b> <b>call</b> alarms among 3091 community-dwelling adults aged 65 + who reported difficulties of mobility or activities of daily living.

40|$|Abstract- The {{long history}} of fingerprint, their {{extensive}} use in forensics and with need of <b>automatic</b> <b>personal</b> identification in recent years, fingerprints is receiving a lot of attention. There is misconception that fingerprint identification is a fully solved problem. However numerous fingerprint systems currently available which use minutiae based approach still do not meet performance requirement of several civilian applications. Performance of these systems degrades with deterioration {{in the quality of}} fingerprint image. In absence of an a priori enhancement step most of the binarization based techniques do not provide satisfactory results when applied to low quality images. Thus trying to eliminate these shortcomings we present an improved approach for fingerprint recognition providing accurate <b>automatic</b> <b>personal</b> identification. In this approach we use optical sensor which captures image of excellent quality with large capture area and superior reliability. The recognition algorithm first use histogram equalization technique to improve the global contrast of an image, then enhancement of the image is done by an efficient enhancement technique. We then use binarization based method to extract minutiae. False minutiae are removed using thresholding technique. The matching is based on determining the total number of matched minutiae based on Euclidian distances. This system is tested on two different databases. The experimental result shows that incorporating a fast enhancement technique and using an optical scanner increase the accuracy of the system for lower values of False accept rate...|$|R

The process is complex, because it is influenced by many factors related to the form, position, illumination, rotation, translation, disguise and occlusion of face characteristics. This work presents a searching method to identify a face in a training database. We have proposed an algorithm for face recognition based on LDA subspace using a SOM neural net to memorize each class (face) in the stage of classification / identification. The interaction between the number of eigenvectors in the PCA and LDA subspaces has been analyzed to establish the rate recognition. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Fingerprint {{recognition}} {{is very important}} in <b>automatic</b> <b>personal</b> identification. In conventional fingerprint recognition algorithms, fingerprints are represented graphically with a simple set of minutiae and singular points, but the information in this kind of representation is not adequate for large-scale applications or where fingerprint quality is poor. A complete and compact representation of fingerprints is thus highly desirable. In this chapter, we focus on research issues in the graphical representation of fingerprints. We first introduce minutiae-based representation and provide some models for the graphical representation of orientation fields. Latterly, we deal with the generation of synthetic fingerprint images and conclude with a discussion of how to establish a complete fingerprint representation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Anti-spoofing {{protection}} of biometric systems {{is always a}} serious issue in real-life applications of an <b>automatic</b> <b>personal</b> verification system. Despite the fact that face image {{is the most common}} way of identifying persons {{and one of the most}} popular modalities in automatic biometric authentication, little attention has been given to the spoof resistance of face verification algorithms. In this paper, we discuss how a system based on DCT features with a likelihood-ratio-based classifier can be easily spoofed by adding white Gaussian noise to the test image. We propose a strategy to address this problem by measuring the quality of the test image and of the extracted features before making a verification decision. ...|$|R
