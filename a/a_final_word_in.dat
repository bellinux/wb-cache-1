40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between Rowan Williams and Mikhail Bakhtin, especially Bakhtin’s notion of polyphony. This thesis traces {{the presence of the}} polyphonic approach in Williams’ work to three main issues: the debate around the nature and future of the Anglican Communion, the debate around the place of Christianity in the increasingly secular modern West and the debate around the nature of faith presented in the works of Dostoevsky. Adopting Bakhtin’s polyphonic approach, Williams sees the need for an on-going conversation, one that argues for the equality of voices within a conversation, one that resists the impulse toward closure and one that resists the impulse toward uttering <b>a</b> <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> a debate. This thesis also touches on the polyphonic quality of the works of Hans Urs von Balthasar, Vern S. Poythress and John Gray...|$|E

[...] In Evans' design, the y-dot {{was part of}} the original syllabics set, but due to ease of confusion between it and the w-dot in handwritten documents, most communities abandoned the y-dot in favour of the y-cross , which is still being used among communities using Western Finals.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was adapted from the {{sentence}} completion task of Hartman and Hasher (1991). We addressed the question raised by Burke (1997) : are the age-related differences in priming effects found in that task better explained by deficits in explicit memory or by inefficient inhibitory mechanisms? In the study phase, older and younger adults read high cloze sentences ending with an expected or <b>an</b> unexpected <b>final</b> <b>word.</b> <b>In</b> the second phase, {{participants were asked to}} complete sentence frames with either the <b>final</b> <b>word</b> presented during the study phase (inclusion condition) or with another, new word (exclusion condition). The third phase was an indirect memory test of perceptual identification. Finally, we compared explicit memory for recalled and inhibited <b>words</b> <b>in</b> a recognition test. In perceptual identification by older adults, priming was equivalent for recalled and inhibited <b>words,</b> whereas <b>in</b> younger adults priming was higher for recalled than for inhibited <b>words.</b> <b>In</b> the explicit memory test, recognition scores were lower for inhibited <b>words</b> <b>in</b> both age groups. These results are consistent with the view of Hasher and Zacks (1988), who assume an age-related decline in the ability to suppress no-longer-relevant information...|$|R

This explains why Börje has grave pitch accent) today: since the synkope at {{the transition from}} Proto-norse to Norse the name has been disyllabic, {{which leads to a}} word being pronounced with the grave accent in modern Swedish. Hence, the vowel in the second syllable of old Swedish Birghir or Birgher was no svarabhaktivowel like the &#x2011;e&#x2011; <b>in</b> modern Swedish <b>words</b> such as the a&#x2011;stem dager, which at one stage was monosyllabic (dagr) and therefore has (acute pitch accent).|$|R
40|$|Templates aliases for C++ This note is an {{expansion}} on the proposal [2] to add template aliases to C++. It further discusses the fundamental issue, the solution suggested in [2] and several possible directions of generalizations to non-template and non-type settings. This {{does not constitute}} <b>a</b> <b>final</b> <b>wording</b> for inclusion <b>in</b> the working paper; rather it {{is a collection of}} ideas as a basis for further discussions. This paper being {{an expansion}} on previous previous proposals to add “typedef template ” or “parameterized type aliases ” to C++, we encourage the reader to have copies of the papers [2, 4] in hand while reading this note. 1 Parameterized type aliases C and C++ provide typedef as a mechanism for introducing a new name for an existing type. With increasing use of parameterized types in C++ libraries and programs, the need for a notion of parameterized type aliases has been pressing. The famous standard allocator rebind hack is a wellknown simulation of parameterized type aliases and work-around for lack of language feature. The notion of template alias [2] aims at providing support for declaring families of aliases. This new feature gives opportunities for building advanced libraries as those described by Walter Brown [1], otherwise hard or impossible to achieve within current standard C++ semantics. With current C++, parameterized aliases for type expressions arew simulated {{along the lines of the}} following example: [...] - Example # 1 [...] -/ / My own storage allocato...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn an ERP study, {{following}} stimuli with a {{world knowledge}} violation we added a sentence-level context which made a world knowledge violation more acceptable in order to investigate how participants processed the subsequent sentence context. Sentences consisting of five Chinese words were of three experimental types: correct sentences with correct world knowledge and coherent sentence meaning, incoherent sentences {{with a world}} knowledge violation and incoherent sentence meaning, and ‘re-coherent’ sentences with a world knowledge violation but coherent sentence meaning. The results showed both incoherent and re-coherent conditions modulated N 400, elicited by the critical word which contained the world knowledge violation, and a negative deflection elicited by the <b>final</b> <b>word,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar way, reflecting the immediate world knowledge integration of critical word and low predictability of <b>final</b> <b>word</b> respectively. An additional negative deflection was elicited only by the <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> the incoherent condition, probably reflecting global sentence context integration. These results provide support for immediate world knowledge integration, and indicate that subsequent new sentence context can immediately influence previous world knowledge constraints...|$|R
