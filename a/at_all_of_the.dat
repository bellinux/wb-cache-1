5|$|At 20:45 on 25 April, the Lehi {{carried out}} {{an attack on}} a divisional car park in Tel Aviv. On that night, the car park was guarded by ten men from the 5th Parachute Battalion. The attackers, around thirty men, {{established}} a fire base in a house overlooking the car park. The attack began with a bomb thrown into a guard tent. Gunfire was directed <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers in the area, then twenty of the attackers stormed the car park. Once inside the compound, they entered the guard tents, killing four unarmed soldiers and looting the rifle racks of weapons. Another two off-duty soldiers, responding to the attack, were killed approaching the car park. In total, seven men from the division were killed.|$|E

It is the main mosque in the city, and an iconic building in Somali society. With a capacity of up to 10,000 worshippers, it is the single largest masjid in the Horn region. In 2015, the federal authorities completed formal refurbishments on the mosque's infrastructure.

5|$|As of 2008, Plumb was the US Olympic athlete {{with the}} {{greatest}} number of appearances in any sport at the Games. He was named to the US team in every Olympic games between 1960 (his first) and 1984, as well as appearing for the last time at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and competed <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Games except for 1980, when the US did not compete. During his seven Olympic appearances, he gathered multiple medals. At the 1960 Summer Olympics, Plumb took an individual 15th, while the US team did not finish the competition. At the 1964 Games, he repeated his individual performance, while the US team improved to take the silver medal. At these Games, he became the first rider ever to win a medal on a horse that he had never previously ridden in competition. Plumb had planned to ride his main event horse, Markham, but on the flight to the Games in Tokyo, the horse panicked, possibly due to a bad experience previously suffered in a horse trailer. In order to keep him from destroying his stall and potentially the aircraft, the horse was euthanized. Plumb instead rode Bold Minstrel, a horse loaned to him by another top-level eventer.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} vacuum trains that are {{designed}} to remove trash off of the tracks, but are ineffective and often broken. A 2016 study by Travel Math had the New York City Subway listed as the dirtiest subway system in the country {{based on the number of}} viable bacteria cells. In August 2016, the MTA announced that it had initiated Operation Track Sweep, which is an aggressive plan that will dramatically reduce the amount of trash on the tracks and in the subway environment, and in turn should reduce track fires and train delays. The frequency of station track cleaning will be increased. In a two-week period, 94 stations will be cleaned, an increase from 34 stations. Starting on September 12, 2016, the MTA launched an intensive two-week, system-wide cleaning from all of the tracks <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system's stations. New portable track vacuum systems are in the works as the MTA is working with two manufacturers. Three new powerful vacuum trains, two arriving in 2017, and the third in 2018, and 27 new refuse cars will be part of the operation.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{the duties}} of the sheriff include law {{enforcement}} services of the two county courthouses and surrounding property, service of court-ordered warrants, writs, protective orders, and other injunctions, and limited patrol responsibility with the County Police. The Domestic Violence Unit has expanded its role in the county to include responding to calls for service that are domestic-related. The creation of the School Resource Deputy division has placed a deputy sheriff <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local high schools, replacing the County Police. All other law enforcement services of the county are provided by multiple agencies but mostly left to the separate Prince George's County Police Department (PGPD), though some responsibilities are shared by both agencies. The PGSO, like most other county-level law enforcement agencies in the United States, is a progressive agency with an array of services in tom a Specialized Services Team dealing with high-risk arrest warrants and barricaded situations to community services aiding the county's residents in safety education. Although the agency is not yet nationally accredited, it currently has a unit dedicated to accreditation.|$|E

E-ZPass was installed <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mainline exits by March 1998. On May14, 2010, a new E-ZPass configuration, consisting of two highway speed E-ZPass lanes in each direction, became operational at the Woodbury toll plaza, with concrete barriers separating the faster traffic from the staffed toll lanes necessary for vehicles not equipped for E-ZPass. A similar project is in development at the Williamsville toll plaza.|$|E

Similarly, a clear Greek homeland for the Sea Peoples failed to materialize. Retaining Müller's three waves and Kretschmer's Pelasgian pockets the scholars continued to search for the Dorians in other quarters. Müller's common ancestor of Greek and Latin had vanished by 1950; and by 1960, although still given lip service, the concept of Greek developing outside of Greece was in decline.|$|E

25|$|Starting in 1984, all {{dogs are}} {{examined}} by veterinarians/nurses {{before the start}} of the race, who check teeth, eyes, tonsils, heart, lungs, joints, and genitals; they look for signs of illegal drugs, improperly healed wounds, and pregnancy. All dogs are identified and tracked by microchip implants and collar tags. On the trails, volunteer veterinarians examine each dog's heart, hydration, appetite, attitude, weight, lungs, and joints <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> checkpoints, and look for signs of foot and shoulder injuries, respiration problems, dehydration, diarrhea, and exhaustion. When mushers race through checkpoints, the dogs do not get physical exams. Mushers are not allowed to administer drugs that mask the signs of injury, including stimulants, muscle relaxants, sedatives, anti-inflammatories, and anabolic steroids. , the Iditarod claims that no musher has been banned for giving drugs to dogs.|$|E
25|$|Precoding is multi-stream beamforming, in {{the narrowest}} definition. In more general terms, it is {{considered}} to be all spatial processing that occurs at the transmitter. In (single-stream) beamforming, the same signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with appropriate phase and gain weighting such that the signal power is maximized at the receiver input. The benefits of beamforming are to increase the received signal gain – by making signals emitted from different antennas add up constructively – and to reduce the multipath fading effect. In line-of-sight propagation, beamforming results in a well-defined directional pattern. However, conventional beams are not a good analogy in cellular networks, which are mainly characterized by multipath propagation. When the receiver has multiple antennas, the transmit beamforming cannot simultaneously maximize the signal level <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> receive antennas, and precoding with multiple streams is often beneficial. Note that precoding requires knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and the receiver.|$|E
