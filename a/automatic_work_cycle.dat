The snap-back timing method, which measures the {{duration of}} certain operations separately, underestimated the average <b>work</b> <b>cycle</b> time in the clear-cut operation by 6 % but overestimated it by ca. 12 % in the thinning operation.

40|$|Abstract—This work investigates {{fundamental}} {{limits on}} electromechanical energy conversion capacity of piezoelectric transformers by considering a <b>work</b> <b>cycle</b> analysis. Fundamental limitations in a lossless piezoelectric transformer are imposed by maximum electric field strength, maximum surface charge density, maximum stress, and maximum strain. For the lossless case, our analysis {{indicates that the}} mechanical stress limit is the effective constraint in typical PZT materials. For a specific PZT- 5 H sample considered, a mechanical stress-limited <b>work</b> <b>cycle</b> indicates that this material can handle 330 W/cm 3 at 100 kHz. A second direction this work has taken has been an investigation into a soft-switching drive and control circuit, that does not require any magnetic components. The theory of operation of softswitching resonant drive circuitry is discussed, and experimental results on a soft-switching inverter incorporating no magnetic components are reported.

30|$|Time studies {{consist in}} {{measuring}} repetitive work cycles; therefore, determining their structure {{is a key}} issue when planning measurements. Magagnotti and Spinelli (2012) only specify that {{the structure of a}} <b>work</b> <b>cycle</b> should accurately describe the work process. The degree of detail of the <b>work</b> <b>cycle</b> division should reflect the degree of complexity of the work. In this respect, the present study is a development of research on work variability and the appropriate selection of measuring tools (Szewczyk 2011 a, 2011 b, 2014 a, 2014 b), thus contributing a new element to the issue of work analysis. The present analyses have determined a new factor shaping the accuracy of chronometric measurements, namely the real structure and length of a <b>work</b> <b>cycle</b> that is observable in the field. It is these factors that should, by definition, be taken into account in the design of measurements. According to the current general assumptions, the structure of harvester <b>work</b> <b>cycles</b> is considered to be stable, which is a great simplification. Due to the variability of harvesting conditions, the rhythm of work in different areas may vary, and this should be reflected by the method of taking measurements. In practice, it is difficult to apply detailed methodological procedures on single felling sites (the time series method presented in our study) so as to describe the variability and determine the correct duration of <b>work</b> <b>cycles.</b> In view of the above, simplified indices of the measurement error level could be used, as proposed in our study for operations characterised by lower (thinning operations) and higher (clear-cut operations) work variability.|$|R

30|$|The {{accuracy}} of timing measurements is usually {{linked to the}} degree of work variability. Seemingly, the problem only comes down to determining the length of a <b>work</b> <b>cycle</b> and dividing it into components. The degree of {{accuracy of}} the <b>work</b> <b>cycle</b> division adopted in our study was consistent with the standard classifications seen in other studies (Picchio et al. 2012). The structure of the duration of individual operations observed in <b>work</b> <b>cycles</b> was similar to those reported in other studies, and the differences were due to different stand conditions (Nurminen et al. 2006). The stands analysed in our study were characterised by larger tree diameter, and therefore, the duration of wood-processing operations was higher (42 % in thinning stands, 52 % in clear-cut stands). A similar situation occurred in the case of travel time between successive work stations. The most likely factor was the impact of the lack of access to the stands via the skid trails.|$|R

30|$|The average {{duration}} of <b>work</b> <b>cycles</b> was also determined {{from the data}} collected in the PSION microcomputer using the standard calculation method of snap-back timing. The snap-back timing method consisted of measuring the durations of certain operations separately (i.e. the timer is snapped back, or reset, {{at the end of}} each activity), determining their mean value and totalling the data obtained according to the arbitrary, theoretical structure of <b>work</b> time <b>cycles</b> (the total of work times 1 – 5 in Table 2). Every main <b>work</b> <b>cycle</b> consisted of four activities: (1) positioning; (2) cutting time; (3) felling/pulling a tree onto a machine; and (4) delimbing and bucking (Nurminen et al. 2006) plus travel within a worksite (5). The start of the next cycle was indicated by another cutting operation.|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} research, {{it was assumed}} that the {{accuracy}} of the time study depended on: (1) the way in which work times were measured; and (2) the succession of <b>work</b> <b>cycles.</b> Due to the skewed distribution of the response variable, differences in the duration of <b>work</b> <b>cycles</b> and particular time categories, determined by the PSION (cumulative timing—CT PSION; snap-back timing—SB PSION) and the VIDEO (cumulative timing—CT VIDEO) methods, were compared using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. The duration of <b>work</b> <b>cycles</b> recorded by means of the applied calculation methods, CT PSION and CT VIDEO, was determined using the single-band Fourier analysis for time series, obtained upon encoding individual activities according to the scheme presented in Table 2. A sequence of activities was considered a time series. Names of the following operations, encoded as numbers, were the observed variables, while the succession of particular activities (work sequence) formed the ordering variable. In contrast to random sampling, time series are characterised by a non-incidental order of observations. For such data, a cyclicality of its occurrence can be determined, which was used in the study presented here. Having obtained a time series {{with the use of a}} moving average (equal weights), the single-band Fourier analysis was employed to detect a variable cyclical structure of the time series under investigation (Szewczyk et al. 2014). With regard to the snap-back timing PSION calculation method, the duration of a <b>work</b> <b>cycle</b> was determined for regular, five-activity cycles.|$|R

The homogeneity of the research sample was examined using variance analysis of the time taken to travel between successive worksites (travel between successive <b>work</b> <b>cycles</b> as described in Table 2). With regard to tasks performed by the harvester, the above-mentioned activity is characterised by the greatest variability within the group of all operational work times (Szewczyk and Kulak 2013). This particular activity was selected for the analysis due to its high level of variability. No statistically {{significant difference was found}} in the mean travel time within a worksite; therefore, subsequent analyses were performed using the entire research sample.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: It is very {{important}} that the time needed for new workers to achieve standard output rates are as short as possible. It is noted in practice however that for more difficult manual work methods the output increases fast in the beginning but stagnates after a certain time at a level well below the normative output rate. This is due to the presence of difficult elements in the work method that require special skills which are not encountered in the motions that human beings use in daily life. As these elements only represent {{a small part of the}} complete <b>work</b> <b>cycle,</b> it takes a long time to get the necessary routine due to the need for many repetitions of the <b>work</b> <b>cycle.</b> Based on a methodology named ‘analytic training’, developed in the sixties and seventies we propose a training approach to overcome this problem. Motion study and skills analysis identify difficult work elements and for these, special exercises for focused training are developed in order to speed up the learning time for the complete <b>work</b> <b>cycle.</b> An example from a manufacturing plant in Belgium will be discussed to illustrate the approach...|$|R
