40|$|Equipment {{manufacturing}} industry is the strategic industries of a country. And its core {{part is the}} CNC machine tool. Therefore, enhancing the independent research of relevant technology of CNC machine, especially the open CNC system, is of great significance. This paper presented some key techniques of an Intelligent <b>Automatic</b> <b>Turning</b> <b>System</b> and gave a viable solution for system integration. First of all, the integrated system architecture and the flexible and efficient workflow for perfoming the intelligent <b>automatic</b> <b>turning</b> process is illustrated. Secondly, the innovated methods of the workpiece feature recognition and expression and process planning of the NC machining are put forward. Thirdly, the cutting tool auto-selection and the cutting parameter optimization solution are generated with a integrated inference of rule-based reasoning and case-based reasoning. Finally, the actual machining case based on the developed intelligent <b>automatic</b> <b>turning</b> <b>system</b> proved the presented solutions are valid, practical and efficient...|$|R

Vehicle turning movement data from signalized intersections is utilized for numerous applications {{in the field of}} trans-portation. Such applications include real-time adaptive signal control, dynamic traffic assignment, and traffic demand estimation. However, it is very time consuming and costly to obtain vehicle turning movement information manually. Previous efforts to simplify this process were focused on solving the problem using an O-D matrix, but this method proved to be inaccurate and unreliable with the existing data acquisition system. Another study involved the identifica-tion of vehicle turning movements from the detector information, but the presence of shared lanes led to uncertainties in vehicle matching, thus limiting application of the method only to intersections without shared lanes. In light of those unsuccessful attempts, this paper develops and tests a <b>system</b> called the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Turning</b> Movement Identification <b>System</b> (ATMIS), which estimates vehicle turning movements at a signalized intersection in real time, regardless of its geometry. The results from lab experiments as well as a field test show that the algorithm is very promising and ma...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of tobacco plant waste composting, by the manual turning and the forced aeration system, was compared. Tobacco plant waste, cow manure, urea fertiliser, and a compost inoculum mixture at a 100 : 10 : 0. 2 : 0. 01 ratio respectively, with 60 % (w/v) moisture content, {{were set up}} in piling forms. The piles of the manual <b>turning</b> <b>system</b> were provided with turning aeration by hand at intervals of 7 days during the composting process. For the forced aeration system, each pile was aerated by a 3 -HP air pump with a flow rate of 19 litres min- 1 for 15 minutes every morning and evening. The completely randomised design of turned and force-aerated piles was performed in triplicate. The composting activity of both systems during the composting period was measured by several parameters: temperature, pH, moisture content, C/N ratio, growth of microorganisms, cellulase activity, and nicotine degradation in the set-up piles. Both systems had similar temperature, pH, and moisture content conditions in the piles during the composting process. However, the forced aeration system was more advantageous {{for the growth of}} mesophilic and thermophilic microorganisms, for cellulase activity from cellulase-producing microorganisms, and for nicotine degradation, when compared to the manual <b>turning</b> <b>system.</b> In conclusion, the forced aeration system was more efficient than the manual <b>turning</b> <b>system</b> in composting and is a viable alternative method for the composting process...|$|R

This approach includes the detection and recognition of both numerical limit and national limit (cancellation) signs {{with the addition of}} <b>automatic</b> vehicle <b>turn</b> detection. The <b>system</b> utilizes both RANSAC-based colourshape detection of speed limit signs and neural network based recognition whilst turn analysis relies on an optic flow based method. As primary detection is based on a robust colour and shape detection methodology this results in a real-time algorithm that is invariant to variable road conditions. The integration of both limit, cancellation and vehicle turn detection within the bounds of real-time system performance represents an advance on prior work within this field. R I...|$|R

In today's competitive environment, governments and public service authors face an increasing need to reduce operating costs without sacrificing productivity and comfort levels. As electricity is the major concern issue, therefore reducing electrical energy consumption and cost is an important step in meeting that goal.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The objective of the research is to study {{the design of a}}nd operating strategies for advanced tool flow systems in highly automated <b>turning</b> <b>systems.</b> A prototype workstation has been built to aid this process. The thesis consists of three main parts. In the first part the current flexible manufacturing technology is reviewed with emphasis laid on tool flow and production scheduling problems. The 'State-of-the-Art' <b>turning</b> <b>systems</b> are studied, to highlight the requirement of the computer modelling of tool flow systems. In the second part, the design of a computer model using fast modelling algorithms is reported. The model design has concentrated on the tool flow system performance forecasting and improving. Attention has been given to the full representation of highly automatic features evident in <b>turning</b> <b>systems.</b> A number of contemporary production scheduling rules have been incorporated into the computer model structure, with the objectives of providing a frontend to the tool flow model, and to examine the tool flow problems interactively with the production scheduling rules. The user-interface of the model employs conversational type screens for tool flow network specification and data handling, which enhances its user friendliness greatly. An effective, fast, and easy to handle data base management system for tool, part, machine data entries has beenÂ· built up to facilitate the model performance. The third part of the thesis is concerned with the validation and application of the model with industry supplied data to examine system performance, and to evaluate alternative strategies. Conclusions drawn from this research and the recommendations for further work are finally indicated...|$|R

While federal funding helped paid the Grand Central portion of the $20million project, the $11.5million for the Northern State came out of the New York State budget. The project would not cost any homes to be taken down, but would cost a lot of trees to be taken down along the roadway.

50|$|Before the {{invention}} and {{widespread use of}} stoves, food was primarily cooked over open flames from a hearth. To roast meat racks with skewers, or, if accessible, complicated gear arrangements, would be utilized to turn the piece(s). In the past, this method was often associated with the upper class and special occasions rather than customary meal times because it required freshly killed meat and close attention during cooking. It was easy to ruin the meatâs taste with a smoky fire or negligence to rotate it at regular intervals. Thus, elite families, {{who were able to}} afford quality meat, appointed this task to servants or invested in technology like <b>automatic</b> <b>turning</b> devices. With further technological advances, cooking came to accommodate new opportunities. By the 1860s, working families were able to afford low-priced stove models that became sufficiently available. However, the key element of observation during roasting became difficult and dangerous to do with the coal oven. Hence, traditional roasting disappeared as kitchens became no longer equipped for this custom and soon thereafter, âbakingâ came to be called âroastingâ.|$|R
