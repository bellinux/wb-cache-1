[...] "I thought that we would get few answers, but received almost 800 responses immediately, and later {{it turned into a}} riot <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know if they would get out of control, but nothing happened, my fans are super cool," [...] Lafourcade told Variety Latino.

500|$|On August 3, House of Cards {{was going}} to film a presidential {{motorcade}} at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. at 3 PM. However, Chief of police Cathy L. Lanier of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPD) revoked the permits that morning. An MPD spokesperson explained [...] "The Metropolitan Police Department is not the lead agency on presidential motorcades <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to portray ourselves as such". As a result, the production crews did a last minute filming of the desired scenes back in Baltimore. The next day, Mayor of the District of Columbia Vincent Gray stated that there was confusion on what role the MPD would play in the filming. A spokesperson from his office stated that [...] ""MPD {{is not going to}} rent itself out as extras for film ... That's what MPD's decision was focused on. We're not going to be actors." [...] On October 2, all issues were resolved and the motorcade was filmed as originally planned without any MPD personnel [...] "actively participate in the filming".|$|E

All the effects were completed in the two weeks between the filming and airing of the episode. Wen noted that [...] "Kevin Tancharoen directed [...] and he’s amazing with his directing with the Mortal Kombat series. So we had this really complicated sequence where we do this 360 and it reveals me and it reveals me again and there’s no cut and you wonder how that happens {{in one of the}} fight sequences. And that’s because they completely scanned and CGIed my face onto the stunt double. So there’s a tremendous amount of work that went into the fight scenes <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{have a lot of time}} to do it." [...] She also elaborated that [...] "On the day of, you have the set and you have the cameras, and you have to deal with special effects, because on top of everything else we had to scan my face and go through this incredible process of taking a million pictures so they were able to meld it onto Sam’s face." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1991, McCall signed for Scottish club Rangers for £1.2 million. Rangers had just won their third {{successive}} Scottish Premier Division title. Under newly appointed manager Walter Smith, McCall ended up playing in the final six of the club's nine successive Scottish league titles. In his first season at Ibrox, Rangers won the league and cup double, before they achieved greater success in 1992–93, winning both cups 2–1 against Aberdeen and coming nine points ahead of Aberdeen in the league. McCall also enjoyed European success that season when the Glasgow club narrowly missed out on an appearance in the UEFA Champions League 1992–93 final, coming second in the semi-final group stage to eventual winners Olympique de Marseille. Citing the reason for their success as the spirit which Smith instilled in the team, McCall later said: [...] "It was an incredible season. We won the domestic Treble, we went 44 games unbeaten <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> lose a single game in Europe. And, though we said we {{would do it again}} next year, we all knew it was unrepeatable." [...] In 1993–94, Rangers added another Scottish League Cup title along with the league championship, but lost 1–0 in the final of the Scottish Cup to Dundee United, surprisingly being denied a second successive treble. The following season saw Rangers win the league by their greatest margin as they finished 15 points ahead of Motherwell, but they failed to reach the final of either of the domestic cups. Although their winning margin was reduced to four points, from city rivals Celtic, in 1995–96, Rangers' points tally of 87 was a record-high total. McCall played in his fourth Scottish Cup final as Rangers defeated Hearts 5–1. His Rangers side again pushed Celtic into second place in 1996–97 and defeated Hearts 4–3 in the Scottish League Cup. But with the club chasing an unprecedented 10th straight title in 1997–98 they had to settle for the runners-up position, with Celtic winning the league by two points {{on the final day of}} the season. McCall was substituted in the Scottish Cup final defeat to Hearts as Rangers went the season without picking up a single title for the first season in McCall's time at the club.|$|E

[...] It {{was the first time}} since 1967 that Texas avoided making a turnover in the Red River Shootout. [...] Oklahoma also suffered from penalties, committing 11 to the Longhorns' 3.

[...] Beyond this facade, the PS was torn by factionalism. The radical section made open calls for the party's transformation. In the theoretical organ Lupta de Clasă, there was already talk of forming [...] "the vanguard party of the proletariat, the communist party". Yet, as Moscovici explained in a 1922 essay, Problemele actuale ale mișcării socialiste ("Current Issues Facing the Socialist Movement"), [...] "although ours is a revolutionary party, who realizes that Capitalist Society cannot be overturned in any other way but through a revolution—once our Society, like our proletariat, is ripened enough for it —, it would be an enormous mistake to maintain that the general strike has aimed to overthrow the current State's regime."

2500|$|Between 3 and 4 {{o'clock in}} the {{afternoon}} of the said 29th, it began to rain mud and ashes at Caysasay ( [...] from the volcano) and this rain lasted three days. The most terrifying circumstance was that the whole sky was shrouded in such darkness that we could not have seen the hand placed before the face, {{had it not been for}} the sinister glare of incessant lightnings. Nor could we use artificial light as this was extinguished by the wind and copious ashes which penetrated everywhere. All was horror those three days, which appeared rather like murky nights <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> occupy ourselves with anything but see to it that the natives swept off the roofs the large quantities of ashes and stones which kept on accumulating upon them and threatened to bring them down upon us, burying us alive beneath their weight. But fearing that even these precautions might prove unavailing, we 3 Europeans – viz. Fr. Prior, the Alcalde, and myself – the only ones who were at the time in the Convento of Caysasay, took refuge on the landing of the stairs; as the safest place, and awaited there whatever God might dispose with regard to us. To all this was added incessant thunder and lightning, and it really looked as if the world was going to pieces and its axis had been displaced.|$|E

And that was a mistake. But I put 6,000 more cops on the streets. And that was no mistake. The school strike went on too long and we all made some mistakes.

2500|$|Rundstedt's Corps {{disintegrated}} in {{the wake}} of defeat and the German Revolution, but while most officers were demobilised, he remained in the Army, apparently at the request of General Wilhelm Groener, who assumed leadership of the shattered Army. He briefly rejoined the General Staff, but this was abolished {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Versailles, signed in June 1919. In October Rundstedt was posted to the staff of Military District (Wehrkreis) V, based in Stuttgart, under General Walter von Bergmann. He was there when the attempted military coup known as the Kapp Putsch took place in March 1920. Bergmann and Rundstedt, like most of the Army leadership, refused to support the coup attempt: Rundstedt later described it as [...] "a failure and a very stupid one at that." [...] This was not an indication of any fondness for the Weimar Republic on Rundstedt's part – he remained a monarchist. It was a reflection of his view that Army officers should not interfere in politics, and should support the government of the day, whatever its nature: a view he was to hold firmly to throughout his career. He testified at the Nuremberg Trials in 1946: [...] "We generals did not concern ourselves with politics. We did not take part in any political discussions, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> hold any political discussions among ourselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 9 June, the Supreme Constitutional Court {{gave its}} final ruling on Maiteeq's contested vote, declaring {{that it was}} unconstitutional and invalid without citing a legal basis for the decision. The GNC {{accepted}} the ruling via a statement by the parliament's second deputy speaker. Maiteeq stepped down shortly after, saying {{that he would be}} [...] "the first" [...] to comply with the judiciary's ruling. [...] "Abdullah al-Thani is the caretaker prime minister until congress learns the court's reasons for deciding Maiteeq's election was unconstitutional," [...] he said. The next day, Haftar announced that he had agreed to a ceasefire deal brokered by the Crisis Committee appointed by the government which also includes dialogue with other warring parties. The deal was attempted to allow Libyans to vote during GNC elections that were to be held on June 25 after parliament agreed to dissolve itself following a ruling by the country's elections commission. Meanwhile, Ansar al-Sharia denied reports that it would hold talks with Haftar. [...] "We have not reached agreement with the Crisis Committee, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> even agree to negotiate with this dictator ," [...] the group said in a statement. This came after the body of one of Ansar al-Sharia's leaders, Al-Mahdi Saad Abu al-Abyad, was found south of Derna. However, the militia group added that it would welcome any talks with tribal leaders instead. On June 11, a suicide car bomber targeted a checkpoint manned by fighters loyal to Gen. Haftar in Benghazi. The lorry exploded upon arriving at the post, killing the perpetrator and injuring five soldiers, one losing his leg.|$|E

[...] He then said [...] "I suppose that Russia started thinking about military intervention in Georgia sometime in 2007."

[...] Saakashvili then slammed the EU’s reaction to Russia’s admission of violating Georgian airspace in July 2008. [...] "This admission by Russia was a clear sign that they were testing western reaction," [...] he stated. Saakashvili said that his first meeting with Medvedev in June 2008 in St. Petersburg was good; while at the next meeting with Medvedev in Astana in July 2008, the Russian president’s stance was changed and [...] "it was clear that they [...] were preparing for something bad." [...] Saakashvili said that Georgia had expected a Russian attack from Abkhazia, rather than from South Ossetia, so major forces of the Georgian army were deployed in the Georgia's west. He said that as the situation deteriorated on 7 August, [...] "we moved one brigade [...] closer to South Ossetia, and later another [...] as well." [...] "But our major forces were still deployed in the west; there was a brigade at Senaki [...] <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> call back our brigade from Iraq, because I was deeply convinced up to the last minute that Russia would not engage in such a large-scale provocation," [...] he said. [...] "Although we were under fire from 120mm mortar launchers, I announced a unilateral ceasefire; at that time we already had one dead soldier in the village of Avnevi and four others were wounded; [...] Kezerashvili was begging me to let him open artillery fire, because, he was telling me, otherwise he was unable to bring [...] from [...] But my response was that we could not open fire whatever happened," [...] he said. Saakashvili also said that the Russian army had moved into South Ossetia before the war had even started. [...] "When we ask our western partners: didn't you see them coming, they respond that their satellites were directed mainly on Iraq and that they could not fly over , but it was impossible {{to see what was happening}} on the ground because it was cloudy.
