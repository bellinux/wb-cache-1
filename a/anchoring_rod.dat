40|$|Abstract:The creep {{character}} of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> in argillaceous soft rock is remarkable. The big undisturbed mudstone samples in Nanning Basin {{as a typical}} argillaceous soft rock is chosen to the research object in this paper. The laboratory simulated destructive tests and the creep tests of full grouted <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> have been down. Through the destructive tests of mudstone sample, the instantaneous adhesive strength between the anchor body and mudstone in Nanning Basin is 70 kPa. By analyzing the creep curves of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod,</b> a conclusion {{is that there is}} a long-term adhesive strength of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> in argillaceous soft rock. When the design adhesive strength of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> is less than the long-term adhesive strength, eventually the <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> is stable during the process of long-term pull-out. When the design adhesive strength of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> is greater than the value, the creep of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> with the time will do not stop until the <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> failure. The greater difference value between the instantaneous and long-term adhesive strength, the faster the rate of creep, the faster the <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> failure. Finally, for the permanent support engineering design of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> in argillaceous soft rock, the paper gives two principles, as follows: (1) the design of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> in argillaceous soft rock must be determined according to the long-term adhesive strength. (2) by using variety of technical measures, the impact of various factors on the creep of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> will be decreased...|$|R

The dynamic {{testing of}} stress wave {{reflection}} method is an easy, economical, rapid and reliable nondestructive testing technology {{and has been}} perfected used in the pile foundation dynamic testing. <b>Anchor</b> <b>rod</b> is {{more in line with}} the wave theory of one-dimensional elastic rod than pile foundation whether to theory or the geometric solid, material, stress state and other factors. The quality of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> is determined by using small strain method (hammering method) of pile foundation dynamic measurement. Four testing <b>anchor</b> <b>rods</b> with different length and integrity were made in project of "China Marine Sport School", stress wave time domain curve of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> was obtained by ZK- 7 E portable intelligent testing of piles instrument, defect location, length of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> and integrity reflected by measured waveform are consistent with the actual situation, the method using pile foundation dynamic testing technology for <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> nondestructive testing is proved feasible and reliable...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of <b>anchor</b> <b>rods,</b> planks and inner knee braces on the critical load of scaffolding systems under concentric and eccentric loads in construction. The steel rebar of grade 3 is used {{in place of the}} patent <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> in this study. The results show that the critical load of the scaffolding system increases by 1. 5 times when <b>anchor</b> <b>rods</b> of a length of 30 cm are used on two sides of each story of the scaffolding system. The critical load increases by 4 times when the scaffolding system has both the <b>anchor</b> <b>rods</b> and plank. The critical load of the scaffolding system with the <b>anchor</b> <b>rods</b> placed on each story is twice as large as that with <b>anchor</b> <b>rods</b> added every two stories; the failure mode of the system also switches from the in-plane to out-of-plane mode. The 30 -cm-long <b>anchor</b> <b>rod,</b> used in place of a steel bar of grade 3, provides a good lateral restraint to the scaffolding system. Moreover, the setup plank can significantly elevate the critical load of the scaffolding system; the critical load increases approximately 1. 5 times under the concentric load, and increases up to 2. 2 times under the TL/ 4 eccentric load, defined as a load applied at a quarter distance from the end. The <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> and the plank should always be included in a scaffolding system to improve its stability, especially under the eccentric loads in construction.

For example, there are needs for supporting <b>anchor</b> <b>rods</b> in to resist both corrosion and wear attacks during operation. In the present work, electroless plating was employed to prepare Ni-P coating on RB 400 steel for improving surface performance and increasing usage of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> in bracing project. Surface and cross-section morphologies of the obtained coating were measured by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and optical microscope (OM). Phase constitution and sectional element distribution were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (GDOES). A ball-on-disc type tribometer and electrochemical workstation were applied to make comparative evaluations on wear and corrosion resistance of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> steel and Ni-P coating, respectively. The results showed that uniform and compact Ni-P coating was formed on RB 400 steel <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> substrate. The surface hardness of substrate had tripled after electroless plating treatment. The obtained Ni-P coating indicated good antifriction effect and possessed excellent wear resistance, which was validated by friction coefficient, mass loss and worn-out appearance.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of column base plate connections under biaxial moment or when {{large numbers of}} <b>anchor</b> <b>rods</b> are utilised is complicated. Such complex connections are regularly found in engineering practice, in spite of proposed, up-to-date finite element modelling techniques and analytical formulations being unsuitable.

In the present paper {{the results of a}} finite element study of single-headed anchors under tension are discussed, leading to the derivation of a simple equation that describes the stiffness of the headed <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> embedded in concrete. Furthermore, this paper suggests a simple and suitable approach to analyse base plate connections independent of loading scenarios, the number of <b>anchor</b> <b>rods</b> and their arrangement, taking into account the actual rigidity of the connection.

Also, the effect of post tensioning on the seismic performance of this type of connection is presented. To characterize the base plate connection damageability, each column base was designed for a particular major inelastic deformation mode such as <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> yielding, yielding of the column, or column and base plate yielding.

The result shows that the axial stress of the rock bolt changes after the excavation and increases steadily with the growing pressure in the wall rock. Results additionally show that the <b>anchor</b> <b>rods</b> at the tunnel vault are subjected to a compressive stress that remains relatively constant after the primary and the secondary lining, while those at the spandrel and {{the corner of the}} tunnel are subjected to increased tensile stress.
