The Chemical Brothers refer to [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] as their [...] "manifesto"; their 1996 track [...] "Setting Sun" [...] is a direct tribute to it.

John Rothchild declared her a feminist before the word existed, but not entirely. Upon hearing that she was to be inducted, she questioned, [...] "Why should they have a Women's Hall of Fame, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> they wanted to put me in the other day? Why not a Citizen's Hall of Fame?" [...] Douglas was included in a tribute to pioneering women when television character Lisa Simpson made a papier-mâché bust of her with Georgia O'Keeffe and Susan B.

[...] "As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> John Bonham play", Jones recalled, [...] "I knew this was going to be great... We locked together as a team immediately".

[...] Cruise met with Spielberg during the filming of Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can (2002) and gave three options of films to create together, one of them being an adaptation of The War of the Worlds.

500|$|Barlow's manager, Simon Fuller, chose Stephen Lipson {{to produce}} the song, seeing his success with 1980s artists like Grace Jones and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Although the song did not sound like what Barlow would usually record, he {{nevertheless}} explained in an interview: [...] "It {{took me a while}} to get my interpretation right because Madonna had written from a female point of view. It's not the kind of song I would write myself. But as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> it, I thought 'This is a hit'." [...] A dance-pop song, [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] is set in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Barlow's voice spans between the nodes of Cm and A3 and has a basic chord progression of C–A–B–Cm in the pre-chorus and E–B–D–A–C–E–A–Cm in the chorus.|$|E

500|$|Due to the song's success, In the Groove was re-issued <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>Heard</b> It Through the Grapevine and {{peaked at}} number {{two on the}} R album chart and number sixty-three on the album chart, which {{was at the time}} Marvin's highest-charted solo studio effort to date. Because of the success of both versions, [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" [...] was the first and last number one on the Billboard R chart in 1968: the Pips version was the first week of January, the Gaye version the last week of December. Gladys Knight was not pleased that Gaye's version usurped her own, and claimed that Gaye's version was {{recorded}} over an instrumental track Whitfield had prepared for a Pips song, an allegation Gaye denied. In 1985, one year following Gaye's death, the song was re-released in the UK reaching number eight thanks to a Levi's commercial (starring Nick Kamen).|$|E

I want you to know... that the sound of the conga nourishes me, the sound of the frying pans gives me life and the sound of the bocú drives me crazy. [...] Several days prior to the beginning of rehearsals, I went to see a doctor; I felt overwhelmed, sad, pensive. He prescribed and gave me some injections, and I felt absolutely no different, but as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the sound of the first bocú, I was completely cured, I felt strong and ready for anything. And I advise those who are unhappy and listless to get an invigorating injection of bocú, conga and frying pans and you’ll be OK in 24 hours.” (Pérez II 1988:22-3) ...|$|E
