5|$|The {{great white}} shark {{was one of the}} many <b>amphibia</b> {{originally}} described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, its first scientific name, Squalus carcharias. Later, Sir Andrew Smith gave it Carcharodon as its generic name in 1833, and also in 1873. The generic name was identified with Linnaeus' specific name and the current scientific name, Carcharodon carcharias, was finalized. Carcharodon comes from the Ancient Greek words karcharos, which means sharp or jagged, and odous, which means tooth.|$|E
5|$|With the phylogenetic classification, the taxon Labyrinthodontia {{has been}} {{discarded}} {{as it is}} a polyparaphyletic group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics. Classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a stem-based or a node-based classification. Traditionally, amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage, while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) and all their descendants is called Lissamphibia. The phylogeny of Paleozoic amphibians is uncertain, and Lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups, like the Temnospondyli (traditionally placed in the subclass Labyrinthodontia) or the Lepospondyli, and in some analyses even in the amniotes. This means that advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature have removed a large number of basal Devonian and Carboniferous amphibian-type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in <b>Amphibia</b> in Linnaean taxonomy, and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy. If the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in <b>Amphibia,</b> it becomes a paraphyletic group.|$|E
50|$|Among {{animals is}} to be {{highlighted}} a wide reptiles' and <b>amphibia's</b> biodiversity: in the park have been found eight different species of snakes and in the obscurity of the old mines dwells the endemic Speleomantes strinatii, at first considered a subspecies of the Italian cave salamander and now a self-standing species.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Amphibia's</b> crystal is 3mm thick lucite(50% {{thicker than}} standard) that is ground like a {{precision}} lens {{to create a}} very good size and seal. The lucite deforms plasticity by a half millimeter under pressure whereas the slightest deformation of a glass or sapphire crystal would crack it. This allows a much lighter, smaller, cheaper crystal to be used. It also {{does not require the}} extra rubber seals and a very high pressure crystal retaining ring.|$|R
50|$|In 1894 in Munsey's Magazine, Harold Payne wrote:For quaintness of conceit and weirdness of {{treatment}} William Francis Ver Beck has no parallel. His specialty is in making animals, and particularly reptiles, to represent {{human beings in}} comical situations. He invests crocodiles, turtles, lizards, frogs, and other <b>amphibiae</b> with human attributes, places them {{in all sorts of}} ludicrous positions, and carries them through endless laughable experiences. He even descends to the vegetable kingdom for his subjects, and invests cabbages, carrots, and beets with the power of lingual communication. Indeed, Ver Beck might well be designated as the artistic Aesop of the time.|$|R
5|$|Most {{other mammals}} studied, {{including}} the pig, cow, cat, dog, bushbaby, macaque, chimpanzee and orangutan, {{have a single}} Mup gene. Some, however, have an expanded number: horses have three Mup genes and gray mouse lemurs have at least two. Insects, fish, <b>amphibia,</b> birds and marsupials appear to have disrupted synteny at the chromosomal position of the Mup gene cluster, suggesting the gene family may be specific to placental mammals. Humans are the only placental mammals found {{not to have any}} active Mup genes; instead they have a single Mup pseudogene containing a mutation that causes missplicing, rendering it dysfunctional.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians are ectothermic, {{tetrapod}} vertebrates of {{the class}} <b>Amphibia.</b> Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit {{a wide variety of}} habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park {{falls within}} two {{terrestrial}} ecoregions of the Palearctic temperate broadleaf and mixed forest— the Balkan mixed forests and the Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests. Forests cover 80% of the park's area, with old-growth forest forming 30% of them. These woods {{are the last}} remaining temperate forests with evergreen laurel undergrowth in Europe. The park has {{the highest number of}} vertebrate species of all protected areas in Bulgaria, including 66 species of mammals, 269 species of birds, 24 species of reptiles, 10 species of <b>amphibia</b> and 41 species of freshwater fish, as well as 70 species of marine fish in the waters of the Black Sea. The invertebrate fauna is poorly researched and includes 84 Bulgarian endemic species, of which 4 are local, and 34 relict species.|$|E

40|$|We {{compare and}} {{contrast}} two methods for fitting probability models to data which arise when animals are marked in batches, without individual identification, and live in several different sites or states. The methods are suitable for populations in which animals are marked at birth and then resighted over several sites/states, for small animals going through several growth stages (insects, <b>amphibiae,</b> etc.), {{as well as for}} the follow-up of animals released after laboratory colour-marking, for example. The methods we consider include a multi-state model for resightings of batch-marked animals, allowing us to estimate survival, transitions, and sighting probabilities. One method is based on the EM algorithm, and the second uses the Kalman filter for computing likelihoods. The methods are illustrated on real data from a cohort of Great Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo, and their performance is evaluated using simulation. We recommend identifying the batches, for instance in the case of sites, by using a different colour on each site at the time of marking, and in general the use of the Kalman filter rather than the EM-based approach...|$|R
40|$|We analyze a {{model of}} {{neuronal}} mechanisms underlying <b>amphibia’s</b> prey-catching behavior, integrating hypotheses generated within different areas of Neuroscience and studying how the efficacy of visual prey-like dummies to release toad’s prey-catching actions depends on parallel distributed processes occurring at multiple levels of temporal abstraction. First, in the scale of 100 ’s of msecs, changes in neuronal activity caused by the stimulus characteristics and its current spatial-temporal relationship with the toad, as well as nervous signals related to actions’ expected consequences (e. g., mouth mechanoreceptors activation after a snapping); second, signals generated during learning events happening at a temporal scale of minutes to hours; third, signals related to the course of actions, within an undetermined time scale that may last for several hours; and fourth, signals generated by changes in motivational factors (e. g., hunger, daily and yearly cycles) occurring at a much slower time scale. In addition, we analyze how in this knowledge representation, the course of actions (plan) is episodic, goal-oriented and can be modulated by learning, or by changes in the agent’s motivational state. This modulation is the outcome of accommodating information of new situations (a non catchable prey-like stimulus) into the dynamics of underlying neuronal mechanisms, in order {{to change the way}} the toad (agent) normally responds to that domain of interaction (stop yielding prey-catching behaviors towards that specific stimulus), without affecting its performance when similar situations appear in its immediate surroundings (prey-catching behaviors to real prey remain unchanged) ...|$|R

25|$|Sea turtles are amphibious reptiles, {{but they}} are not {{amphibians}}. Reptiles belong to the class Reptilia while amphibians belong to the class <b>Amphibia.</b> These are two distinct taxonomic groups. Reptiles have scales and leathery skins, while the skins of amphibians are smooth and porous. Unlike frogs, sea turtle eggs have tough, leathery shells which allow them to survive on land without drying out.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle {{divided the}} living world between animals and plants, {{and this was}} {{followed}} by Carl Linnaeus, in the first hierarchical classification. In Linnaeus's original scheme, the animals were one of three kingdoms, divided into the classes of Vermes, Insecta, Pisces, <b>Amphibia,</b> Aves, and Mammalia. Since then the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum, the Chordata, whereas the various other forms have been separated out.|$|E
25|$|Taxonomists place {{lampreys}} and hagfish in the subphylum Vertebrata of the phylum Chordata, {{which also}} includes the invertebrate subphyla Tunicata (sea-squirts) and the fish-like Cephalochordata (lancelets or Amphioxus). Recent molecular and morphological phylogenetic studies place lampreys and hagfish in the superclass Agnatha or Agnathostomata (both meaning without jaws). The other vertebrate superclass is Gnathostomata (jawed mouths) and includes the classes Chondrichthyes (sharks), Osteichthyes (bony fishes), <b>Amphibia,</b> Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia.|$|E
25|$|It {{was ranked}} as an order under class <b>Amphibia</b> by Watson in 1920 {{and as a}} {{superorder}} by Romer in 1947. An alternative name, Stegocephalia was created in 1868 by American palaentologist Edward Drinker Cope, from Greek stego cephalia—"roofed head", and refer to anapsid skull and the copious amounts of dermal armour {{some of the larger}} forms evidently had. This term is widely used in 19th and early 20th century literature.|$|E
500|$|The word [...] "amphibian" [...] {{is derived}} from the Ancient Greek term ἀμφίβιος (amphíbios), which means [...] "both kinds of life", ἀμφί meaning [...] "of both kinds" [...] and βιος meaning [...] "life".

500|$|Later in the 19th century, temnospondyls were {{classified}} as various members of Stegocephalia, a name coined by the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1868. Cope placed stegocephalians in the class Batrachia, the name then used for <b>Amphibia.</b> Stegocephalia means [...] "roof-headed" [...] in Greek, {{a reference to the}} wide, flat heads of temnospondyls and other early tetrapods. During this time, palaeontologists considered temnospondyls to be amphibians because they possessed three main features: gill arches in juvenile skeletons, indicating they were amphibious for at least the first part of their lives; ribs that do not connect at the underside of the rib cage; and deep pits in the skull that were interpreted as space for mucous glands.|$|E
500|$|Horton Plains {{was a part}} of a large {{system of}} plains and forest cover that {{included}} Agra-Bopats, Moon Plains and Elk Plains. Between 1831 and 1948, it became a Sambar deer hunting ground. Elephants and Wild Boar were also hunted to a lesser extent. During this period lower slopes were cleared initially for coffee and then for tea plantations. As a result, Horton Plains and Peak Wilderness became isolated from other forest and grassland areas. Potatoes were cultivated in the grasslands but planting ceased in 1977. After being declared a National Park, these areas were reinstated as grasslands. Tourism-related issues such as plant removal, littering, fires and noise pollution are major conservation issues. Gem mining, timber logging, the collection of plants for ornamental and medicinal purposes, encroachment, poaching and vehicle traffic are the other threats. The spread of invasive alien species such as gorse (Ulex europaeus), [...] Mist Flower (Ageratina riparia), Crofton Weed (Ageratina adenophora), [...] (Austroeupatorium), Blue Stars (Aristea ecklonii), brackens, and Pennisetum spp. threaten the native flora.

2500|$|The {{traditional}} classification {{was initiated}} by Säve-Söderbergh in the 1930s.

2500|$|Complicating {{the picture}} is the {{question}} of whether Lissamphibia itself may be polyphyletic. Though a minority view, several variants have been forwarded through history. The [...] "Stockholm school" [...] under Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh and Erik Jarvik argued during much of the 20th century that <b>Amphibia</b> as a whole is biphyletic, based on details of the nasal capsul and cranial nerves. In their view lepospondyls are ancestors of frogs, while salamanders and caecilians have evolved independently from porolepiform fish. Robert L. Carroll suggested the tailed amphibians (salamanders and caecilians) are derived from lepospondyl microsaurs and frogs from temnospondyls. The cladistic analysis of Gerobatrachus suggests salamanders and frogs have evolved from temnospondyl stock and caecilians being the sister group of the reptile-like amphibians, rendering Lissamphibia itself an evolutionary grade relative to the remaining tetrapod classes. A consensus on origin of lissamphibians and relationship between the various labyrinthodonts is not likely to materialise soon.|$|E
2500|$|Human F. hepatica {{infection}} {{is determined by}} the presence of the intermediate snail hosts, domestic herbivorous animals, climatic conditions and the dietary habits of man. [...] Sheep, goats and cattle are considered the predominant animal reservoirs. While other animals can be infected, they are usually not very important for human disease transmission. On the other hand, some authors have observed that donkeys and pigs contribute to disease transmission in Bolivia. Among wild animals, it has been demonstrated that the peridomestic rat (Rattus rattus) may {{play an important role in}} the spread as well as in the transmission of the parasite in Corsica. In France, nutria (Myocastor coypus) was confirmed as a wild reservoir host of F. hepatica. [...] Humans are infected by ingestion of aquatic plants that contain the infectious cercariae. Several species of aquatic vegetables are known as a vehicle of human infection. In Europe, Nasturtium officinale (common watercress), Nasturtium silvestris, Rorippa <b>amphibia</b> (wild watercress), Taraxacum dens leonis (dandelion leaves), Valerianella olitoria (lamb's lettuce), and Mentha viridis (spearmint) were reported as a source of human infections. In the Northern Bolivian Altiplano, some authors suggested that several aquatic plants such as bero-bero (watercress), algas (algae), kjosco and tortora could act as a source of infection for humans. Because F. hepatica cercariae also encyst on water surface, humans can be infected by drinking of fresh untreated water containing cercariae. In addition, an experimental study suggested that humans consuming raw liver dishes from fresh livers infected with juvenile flukes could become infected.|$|E
