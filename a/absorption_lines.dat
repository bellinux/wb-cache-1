5|$|A Faraday filter, {{magneto-optical}} filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday Dispersive Optical Filter) {{works by}} rotating the polarization {{of the light}} passing through the vapor cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic <b>absorption</b> <b>lines</b> by the Faraday effect and anomalous dispersion. Only light at the resonant frequency of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect, or the splitting of atomic <b>absorption</b> <b>lines</b> {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field. Light at the resonant frequency of the vapor exits a FADOF near its original strength but with an orthogonal polarization.|$|E

40|$|Context. <b>Absorption</b> <b>line</b> {{indices are}} widely used to {{determine}} the stellar population parameters such as age and metallicity of galaxies, but {{it is not easy to}} obtain the line indices of some distant galaxies that have colours available. Aims. This paper investigates the correlations between <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> indices and colours. Methods. A few statistical fitting methods are mainly used, via both the observational data of Sloan Digital Sky Survey and a widely used theoretical stellar population model. Results. Some correlations between widely used <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> indices and ugriz colours are found from both observational data of early-type galaxies and a theoretical simple stellar population model. In particular, good correlations between colours and widely used <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> indices such as Dn(4000), HgammaA, HgammaF, HdeltaA, Mg 1, Mg 2, and Mgb, are shown in this paper. Conclusions. Some important <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> indices of early-type galaxies can be estimated from their colours using correlations between <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> indices and colours. For example, age-sensitive <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> indices can be estimated from (u-r) or (g-r) colours and metallicity-sensitive ones from (u - z) or (g - z). This is useful for studying the stellar populations of distant galaxies, especially for statistical investigations. Comment: 9 pages, 21 figures, will be shown in A&...|$|R

40|$|A {{novel and}} {{efficient}} <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> recovery technique is presented. A micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) mirror {{driven by an}} electrothermal actuator is used to generate laser intensity modulation through the mirror reflection. Tunable diode laser spectroscopy (TDLS) and photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) are used to recover the target <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> profile which is compared with the theoretical Voigt profile. The target gas is 0. 01 % acetylene (C(2) H(2)) in a nitrogen host gas. The laser diode wavelength is swept across the P 17 <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> of acetylene at 1 535. 4 nm by a current ramp, and an erbium-doped fibre amplifier (EDFA) is used to enhance the optical intensity and increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A SNR of about 35 is obtained with 100 mW laser power from the EDFA. Good agreement is achieved between the experimental results and the theoretical simulation for the P 17 <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> profile...|$|R

Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars.

Since the clouds of gas have no heavy elements, they likely formed in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Most ALF vapor cells use {{alkali metals}} {{because of their}} high vapor pressures; many alkali metals also have <b>absorption</b> <b>lines</b> and {{resonance}} in the desired spectra. Common vapor cell materials are sodium, potassium and caesium. Note that non-metallic vapors such as neon may be used. As the early quantum counters used solid state metal ions in crystals, {{it is conceivable that}} such a medium could be used in the ALFs of today. This is presumably not done because of the superiority of atomic vapors in this capacity.|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the origin}} of AGN <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> {{profiles}} and their diversity could help to explain the physical structure of the accretion flow, and also {{to assess the impact}} of accretion on the evolution of the AGN host galaxies. Here we present our first attempt to systematically address the issue of {{the origin of}} the complexities observed in absorption profiles. Using a simple method, we compute <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> profiles against a continuum point source for several simulations of accretion disk winds. We investigate the geometrical, ionization, and dynamical effects on the <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> shapes. We find that significant complexity and diversity of the <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> profile shapes can be produced by the non-monotonic distribution of the wind velocity, density, and ionization state. Non-monotonic distributions of such quantities are present even in steady-state, smooth disk winds, and naturally lead to the formation of multiple and detached absorption troughs. These results demonstrate that the part of a wind where an <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> is formed is not representative of the entire wind. Thus, the information contained in the <b>absorption</b> <b>line</b> is incomplete if not even insufficient to well estimate gross properties of the wind such as the total mass and energy fluxes. In addition, the highly dynamical nature of certain portions of disk winds can have important effects on the estimates of the wind properties. For example, the mass outflow rates can be off up to two orders of magnitude with respect to estimates based on a spherically symmetric, homogeneous, constant velocity wind.

It was later found that the Star's steep decline in light was due to the circumstellar dust located around the star, which was present at a temperature of ~680 K.

5|$|The {{frequency}} of a photon {{is proportional to}} its energy. As a bound electron transitions between different energy levels of an atom, it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies.

In fact, during the last 100 years, Pleione has demonstrated notable phase changesas a Be phase until 1903, a B phase (1905–1936), a B-shell phase (1938–1954), and another Be phase (1955–1972). It then entered a Be-shell phase in 1972. Then, the star developed many shell <b>absorption</b> <b>lines</b> in its spectrum. At the same time, the star showed a decrease in brightness, beginning at the end of 1971. After reaching the minimum brightness in late 1973, the star gradually brightened.
