5|$|The train {{stopped at}} a station that had no town, and <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while</b> <b>later</b> it passed the only banana {{plantation}} along the route that had its name written over the gate: Macondo. This word had attracted my attention ever since the first trips I had made with my grandfather, but I discovered only as an adult that I liked its poetic resonance. I never heard anyone say it and did not even ask myself what it meant...I happened to read in an encyclopedia {{that it is a}} tropical tree resembling the Ceiba.|$|E
5|$|British Lt. Col. Robert Abercromby {{decided to}} push his {{advantage}} after scattering Irvine's troops. He pushed north and captured St. Thomas Episcopal Church, located on a hillock. Howe arrived <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while</b> <b>later,</b> and ascended {{to the top of}} the church's bell tower in an attempt to view the American positions. Deciding the American defenses were too strong to attack with his present force, he opted to shell their defenses with artillery fire; however, his guns did not have the range to hit Washington's defenses. His forces camped on Chestnut Hill that night, and planned a new way of attack for the following day.|$|E

5|$|Spider-Man {{tries to}} catch up with him and notices him sneaking into his friend Harry's apartment. Sneaking in, he spots Harry's father Norman coming out of a secret {{passageway}} and theorizes that Norman is the Goblin. Spider-Man is forced to slip out after Harry walks in, and misses Harry drinking an experimental, drug-like formula. <b>A</b> <b>short</b> <b>while</b> <b>later,</b> Peter Parker calls Harry and invites him to a Bleecker Street Halloween carnival along with Gwen, Mary Jane and Liz.

Both Daniil and Kirill are agitated by {{the recognition that}} Andrei receives. Daniil refuses to accompany Andrei and reproaches him for accepting Theophanes’ offer without considering his fellows, but soon repents of his temper and tearfully wishes Andrei well when the younger monk comes {{to say goodbye to}} his friend. Kirill is jealous of Andrei and in a fit of anger, decides to leave the monastery for the secular world, throwing accusations of greed in the face of his fellow monks, who also dismiss him. Kirill stumbles out of the monastery into the snowy countryside and is pursued by his dog, but Kirill savagely beats it with his walking stick and leaves it for dead. Andrei leaves for Moscow with his young apprentice Foma (Mikhail Kononov). Foma is another creative character, representing the light-hearted and practical-minded commercial artist. Still he seems to be contemplative enough to get along with Andrei.|$|E
5|$|An early {{governor}} of Gaza Sanjak was Kara Shahin Mustafa, a former jannissary (member {{of a military}} corps) who rose to become an elite military officer and state minister and eventually a vizier and trusted aide of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. He received the governorship of Gaza apparently as an interim appointment before he was appointed Governor of Egypt, although he was deposed three years later by Sultan Selim II. Mustafa died <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while</b> <b>later</b> and his son Ridwan Pasha, who was the treasurer of Yemen, became governor shortly before Mustafa's death. The Ridwan dynasty, which would rule Gaza for over a century, derives its name from Ridwan Pasha. He was later appointed Governor of Yemen, but was deposed two years later {{and returned to the}} governorship of Gaza. After becoming {{governor of}} Ethiopia, Basra, and Diyarbakir in that order, he successfully led an Ottoman contingent against Safavid Persia in 1579.

50|$|Speer Communications {{had planned}} to use WNAB as a base of {{operations}} for a small network of television stations in each of Tennessee's six television markets. A statewide newscast was planned {{as part of the}} network. However, the company went bankrupt before any of the plans could come to fruition. The station was later sold to Lambert Broadcasting (now Tennessee Broadcasting) who operated the station for <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while,</b> and <b>later</b> outsourced its advertising sales and operations to the Sinclair Broadcast Group via an outsourcing agreement.|$|R
50|$|Pope John XXIII was {{the last}} pope to use full papal ceremony, some of which was {{abolished}} after Vatican II, while the rest fell into disuse. His papal coronation ran for the traditional five hours (Pope Paul VI, by contrast, opted for <b>a</b> <b>shorter</b> ceremony, <b>while</b> <b>later</b> popes declined to be crowned).

5|$|Modi {{became an}} RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, {{overseeing}} RSS {{activities in the}} areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he {{went to work for the}} RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS's version of the history of the Emergency. He returned to Gujarat <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while</b> <b>later,</b> and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985. In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi's planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers. After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Through Preston Park, Route370 intersects {{with an old}} {{alignment}} of itself twice {{before coming to the}} main intersection in town, the northern terminus of Route247 (Creamton Drive) and its continuation Rabbit Run Road. The road turns northeastward and passes several residences before intersecting with Shehawken Road, where the road becomes mainly wooded once again. The route parallels an {{alignment of}} former State Route570 and the former Ontario and Western Railroad into Buckingham Township, where the route enters the hamlet of Starlight. In Starlight, Route370 passes the former Ontario and Western station and turns eastward once the old alignment of Route570 merges in. After passing a pond, the highway leaves Starlight and continues northeastward in dense forestry. <b>A</b> <b>short</b> <b>while</b> <b>later,</b> the route turns northward and weaves to an intersection with Route191 (the Hancock Highway) in Buckingham Township. This serves as the northern terminus of Route370.|$|E

At the FBI, Kersh unsuccessfully tries to {{convince}} Doggett to stop investigating Mulder's apparent death. <b>A</b> <b>short</b> <b>while</b> <b>later,</b> as Skinner walks down a hallway, rogue agent Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) activates nanobots {{that he had}} previously placed in Skinner's bloodstream as blackmail. Skinner stumbles in pain, and in an elevator, Krycek reveals himself to Skinner and explains {{that he has a}} vaccine which could save Mulder's life. However, he will only give it if Skinner can ensure that Scully does not give birth to her baby for reasons that he does not disclose. Later, alone in his hospital bed, Miles regains consciousness and goes to take a shower. While doing so, his decaying flesh falls away, revealing a healthy body beneath. He tries to persuade Scully and Doggett that the aliens who abducted him are trying to save humanity. Scully, however, gets a lab report which reveals that Miles's DNA has substantially changed; he is now a new being. Skinner later tells Scully that there is a cure for Mulder's disease, but does not explain Krycek's demands.|$|E

The show was replaced in 1981 by the long-running Good Morning Australia (breakfast TV). A similar, but unrelated, show named Early Birds was broadcast by SAS10 in Adelaide in the early 1970s. The show was hosted by Veronica Overton and Fat Cat. [...] "Early Birds" [...] was a mix of cartoons, competitions and music clips. During one telecast, Overton resigned on camera, saying [...] "Goodbye children. Fat Cat {{will be back on}} Monday, but I won't".

The battalion was understrength, having taken casualties at Oudna, and was running low on ammunition, but it managed to drive off the column with mortar fire; however, this was only a brief respite. Two armoured cars and a tank was seen to be moving towards the battalion from a different direction, reportedly sporting recognition signals of British First Army; Frost sent a party out to greet the vehicles, only {{for them to be}} taken prisoner and it to be revealed that the vehicles were German with captured equipment. The German commander sent one of the captured paratroopers with a message demanding Frost surrender, but he refused to comply; instead he ordered that the radios and mortars were to be destroyed and the battalion would evacuate westwards towards Allied lines, approximately fifty miles away. The battalion managed to withdraw to higher ground, but suffered a number of casualties from the German armour as it did so. Now positioned on the high ground, which consisted of a ridge crowned by two small hills, the paratroopers were attacked by tanks and infantry supported by heavy mortar fire. The battalion suffered a number of casualties but was saved by the unexpected intervention of German aircraft; mistaking their troops for the paratroopers, they knocked out several tanks and inflicted heavy casualties.|$|E

Despite being a smaller engagement in terms of numbers and casualties, the capture of Fort Rivière is much more remembered than the battle at Fort Dipitie where Captain Butler led forty U.S. Marines against 400 Cacos and won. Captain Butler, Sergeant Iams and Private Gross all were awarded Medals of Honor for actions taken during this engagement. After the battle and the high Haitian losses, the U.S. government ordered the U.S. Marines to cease offensive operations against the Cacos without direct permission from Washington.|$|R

In 1783, he financed the first quarterly medical periodical in London, the London Medical Journal, founded by Samuel Foart Simmons, a prominent physician. Explaining the journal's goals, Simmons wrote that it would provide [...] "an account of new medical books and useful discoveries in physic, {{and at the same}} time be a repository for original essays".
