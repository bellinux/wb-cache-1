In 1977, the main stand was completely rebuilt, but an <b>alkali–silica</b> <b>reaction</b> ten years later caused the concrete to crack. Chairman Jacques Ruts, who was previously introduced to the skybox in the United States, considered a new stand to be an opportunity to attract more sponsors. The new main stand – two tiers, with skyboxes in the middle – was introduced in a friendly match against Milan in 1988. In the nineties, the other three stands are also elevated. The last major renovation was {{the closing of the}} four open corners of the stadium. Along with creating more seats, the new corners had window blind-type constructions, which allowed air to flow through in order to let the grass breath. The completion was celebrated in October 2002, with the capacity increased to 35,000. In the summer of 2005, the club removed the tall fences around the pitch, replacing them with lower railings keeping the spectators off the grass. Unauthorized persons who do invade the pitch will receive a €15,000 penalty and a ten-year-ban from visiting the ground.|$|E

It has been used primarily to characterize concrete strength development (ACI Committee 228 2003), cracking (Aggelis et al. 2009), internal defects such as cracks, honeycombs and inclusions (Jung et al. 2002), porosity and permeability (Lafhaj et al. 2006), setting of high performance concrete (Lee et al. 2004; Trtnik et al. 2013) and deterioration of concrete by <b>alkali-silica</b> <b>reactions</b> (Gong et al. 2014; Ju et al. 2017).

30|$|Ground {{granulated}} blast-furnace slag (GGBS) is a green {{construction material}} {{used to produce}} durable concrete. The secondary pozzolanic reactions can result in reduced pore connectivity; therefore, replacing partial amount of Portland cement (PC) with GGBS can significantly {{reduce the risk of}} sulfate attack, <b>alkali–silica</b> <b>reactions</b> and chloride penetration. However, it may also reduce the concrete resistance against carbonation. Due to the time consuming process of concrete carbonation, many researchers have used accelerated carbonation test to shorten the experimental time. However, there are always some uncertainties in the accelerated carbonation test results. Most importantly, the moisture content and moisture profile of the concrete before the carbonation test can significantly affect the test results. In this work, more than 200 samples with various water–cementitious material ratios and various replacement percentages of GGBS were cast. The compressive strength, electrical resistivity, chloride permeability and carbonation tests were conducted. The moisture loss and microstructure of concrete were studied. The partial replacement of PC with GGBS produced considerable improvement on various properties of concrete.|$|R

A comparative study of amorphous and crystalline forms of commercial aluminum hydroxides as inhibitors of <b>alkali-silica</b> <b>reactions</b> in Portland cement mortars has been performed. It was found that at dosages of 1 % to 3 %, amorphous aluminum hydroxide can efficiently inhibit alkali-silica expansion of Portland cement compositions. High inhibiting activity of amorphous Al(OH) 3 additives {{may be explained by}} their ability to actively bind Ca(OH) 2 formed by the hy-dration of silicate phases of cement, to form ettringite (with participation of gypsum). Crystalline Al(OH) 3 additives that do not possess the ability to interact with Ca(OH) 2 even after additional grinding, however, demonstrate week proper-ties to inhibit alkali-silica expansion. This may indicate that the inhibitory effect of Al(OH) 3 at least—partly, may be given by its influence on the concentration of Al 3 + ions in the pore solution. Some expansion of the samples with ad-mixtures of Al(OH) 3 observed during the alkaline expansion accelerated test procedure is not associated with the forma-tion of ettringite and is only due to alkali-silicate reactions...|$|R
30|$|Manufacturing Portland cement (PC) {{is a major}} {{contributor}} of greenhouse gases, responsible for about 5  % of all global carbon dioxide emissions (Habert and Roussel 2009). In comparison, the production of ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) requires less than {{a fifth of the}} energy and produces less than a tenth of the carbon dioxide emissions. It is well known that blast furnace slag cement (BFSC) has been manufactured by integrating GGBS with cement clinker or by separate grinding (Wang et al. 2005). For a long period of time, the application of GGBS was limited to the production of BFSC. Due to its less grindability, the surface area of the produced BFSC was even lower than that of commercial PC and its reactivity was limited. With advancement in technology, finer GGBS (particle size less than 10  μm) with increased reactivity was produced. The secondary pozzolanic reactions can result in reduced pore connectivity in the concrete. Therefore, partial replacement of PC with GGBS can significantly reduce the risk of sulfate attack, <b>alkali–silica</b> <b>reactions</b> and chloride penetration and increase compressive strength (Güneyisi and Gesoğlu 2008; Hadj-Sadok et al. 2010; Nazari and Riahi 2011; Shi et al. 2011, 2012; Teng et al. 2013).

40|$|A {{number of}} factors {{relating}} to various methods of repair for chloride initiated corrosion damage of reinforced concrete have been studied. A novel methodology has been developed to facilitate the measurement of macro and micro-cell corrosion rates for steel electrodes embedded in mortar prisms containing a chloride gradient. The galvanic bar specimen comprised electrically isolatable segmental mild steel electrodes and was constructed such that macro-cell corrosion currents were determinable {{for a number of}} electrode combinations. From this, the conditions giving rise to an incipient anode were established. The influence of several reinforcement and substrate primer systems upon macro-cell corrosion, arising from an incipient anode, within a patch repair have been investigated. Measurements of electrochemical noise were made in order to investigate the suitability of the technique as an on-site means of assessing corrosion activity within chloride contaminated reinforced concrete. For this purpose the standard deviation of potential noise was compared to macro-cell galvanic current data and micro-cell corrosion intensity determined by linear polarisation. Hydroxyl ion pore solution analyses were carried out on mortar taken from cathodically protected specimens. These specimens, containing sodium chloride, were cathodically protected over a range of polarisation potentials.

40|$|For many {{concretes}} and mortars, self-desiccation {{results in}} the creation of empty capillary porosity within the cement paste microstructure, accompanied by a decrease in achieved hydration, an increase in internal stresses, and an increased propensity for early age cracking. One solution to this problem for low water-to-cement ratio concretes where external curing is ineffective has been the development of internal curing. In internal curing, water reservoirs, typically being either fine lightweight aggregates with a high moisture content or superabsorbent polymer particles, are distributed uniformly throughout the concrete microstructure and undergo desiccation themselves, while maintaining saturated conditions within the hydrating cement paste. Since these reservoirs typically contain pores that are much larger than those in the hydrating cement paste, the internal stresses are significantly reduced and early age cracking can be avoided. To date, these internal reservoirs have been filled with water only. Here, it is proposed to fill them with solutions of chemical admixtures such as shrinkage-reducing admixtures or corrosion inhibitors. Two possible advantages of the autogenous distribution of chemical admixtures over delivery by conventional addition to the mixing water are the mitigation or avoidance of possible detrimental interactions between chemical admixtures or detrimental influences of the admixture on fresh concrete properties and a potentially more efficient delivery of admixtures that are partially absorbed by the cement during hydration and in the resulting hydration products. Preliminary results for the FLAIR (Fine Lightweight Aggregates as Internal Reservoirs) system are presented for the case of a shrinkage-reducing admixture. It is envisioned that the FLAIR technology will have the greatest applicability to chemical admixtures that effect the properties of the hardened concrete (as opposed to the fresh concrete), such as shrinkage-reducing admixtures, corrosion inhibitors, and admixtures employed to mitigate <b>alkali-silica</b> <b>reactions...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the characterization of damage accumulation in concrete specimens. Specifically, a nonlinear vibration technique is used to characterize the damage introduced by ongoing <b>alkali-silica</b> <b>reactions</b> (ASR). The nonlinear resonance testing consists of {{an analysis of the}} frequency response of concrete specimens subjected to impact loading. ASR introduces a third gel like phase, which can be expansive in the presence of moisture. The result of ASR is the formation of microcracks and debonding between aggregate and cement phases. Collectively, these changes act to increase the specimens' nonlinearity. As a result, it is found that the concrete samples exhibit nonlinear behavior; mainly a decrease in resonance frequency with an increasing level of excitation strain. The relationship between the amplitude of the response and the amount of frequency shift is used as a parameter to describe the nonlinearity of the specimen. The specimens used in this research are of varying reactivity with respect to ASR, which is induced in accordance with ASTM C 1293. The level of nonlinearity is used as a measure of damage caused by the progress of ASR throughout the one year test duration. These nonlinear resonance results are compared to the traditional measures of expansion described in the standard. The robustness and repeatability of the proposed technique is also investigated by repeated testing of samples assumed to be at a specific damage state. Finally, a petrographic staining technique is used to complement nonlinearity measurements and to further gain understanding of ASR. The results of this study show that the proposed nonlinear resonance methods are very sensitive to microstructural changes and have great potential for quantitative damage assessment in concrete. M.

The expansive reactions between alkalis and alkali-reactive aggregates within concrete structures are a problem which has been known about since the mid 20 th century. This slow-evolving concrete damage causes a huge amount of damage to susceptible concrete structures worldwide. This damage is serious because it leads to a degradation of the material properties of the concrete, leading to a less safe structure. This phenomenon {{is the leading cause of}} dam concrete deterioration. Much research has been carried out in this field in attempting to understand the causes; however the engineering community is far from fully understanding and being able to predict expansions caused by this reaction as it can vary greatly with environmental conditions. This thesis presents a summary of the main factors which affect this reaction, which are the temperature, humidity and confinement stresses. This is given with a view to explaining the design of the experimental testing machine. The aim of the experimental results the machine will provide is to further refine and understand the processes behind the alkali-silica expansion, which will help in the refinement of current expansion-prediction models and in the creation of new models. A brief analysis of some of the main expansion prediction models is given as background to the design of the machine.

40|$|Major highway {{concrete}} pavements in Iowa have exhibited premature deterioration. The cause(s) of the deterioration {{has been the}} subject of much controversy. Various investigators have used different methods to characterize the processes and have arrived at different interpretations.

Evidence for all three processes have been reported. While one or more of these processes is likely to be the cause of the deterioration, the possibility that there may be other deleterious processes should be considered.

The vitreous frit component derived from each gasifier slag source was evaluated {{for use as a}} pozzolan and as aggregate. Pozzolan testing required grinding the frit to very fine sizes which required a minimum of 60 kwhr/ton. Grinding studies showed that the energy requirement for grinding the Polk slag were slightly higher than for the Eastman slag. Fine-ground slag from both gasifiers showed pozzoalnic activity in mortar cube testing and met the ASTM C 618 strength requirements after only 3 days. Pozzolanic activity was further examined using British Standard 196 - 5, and results suggest that the Polk slag was more reactive than the Eastman slag. Neither aggregate showed significant potential for undergoing <b>alkali-silica</b> <b>reactions</b> when used as concrete aggregate with ASTM test method 1260. Testing was conducted to evaluate the use of the frit product as a component of cement kiln feed.
