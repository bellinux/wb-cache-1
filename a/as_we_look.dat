25|$|In October 2017 <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> at the {{convenience}} store channel, Reese’s is the largest confection brand by far: It's 62% larger than the next brand, with more households purchasing Reese’s than any other confection brand across the U.S. Reese’s includes the No. 1-selling confection item – the iconic Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups King Size, and six of the top 20 chocolate/non-chocolate items. The Reese’s brand also accounts for over 47% of all seasonal sales within {{the convenience}} store channel, with the top two items in all four seasons (Valentine's, Easter, Halloween, and Holiday). As a comparison, the next largest brand accounts for only 10% of seasonal sales.|$|E
500|$|They also {{provided}} six examples from print media of more cases of confusion between Donkey Kong and King Kong. The October 1982 issue of Videogaming Illustrated, for example, {{was shown to}} read [...] "our Donkey Kong presentation continues <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> at other gorillas {{who have had a}} fondness for women. Prominent among them is King Kong, who has much in common with the video villain." [...] Another example was Craig Kubey's 1982 The Winner's Book of Video Games, which states that [...] "Donkey Kong [...] a video version of the film classic King Kong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Those in the North aisle are {{illuminated}} {{allowing them}} to be viewed despite them having no natural light being enclosed as a security measure. The restoration {{was made possible by}} a donation from a late parishioner and the windows blessed at Easter 2010 with the following words; Almighty and eternal God, we give you thanks and praise for these stained glass images of your saints. For as often <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> on these images with our bodily eyes, <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> at them may we consider the actions of your saints and think about their sanctity for our inmitation. Bless and sanctify these windows made in honour and in memory of your only begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ and of these saints. We also remember our faithful servant John Ellison in whose memory these lights were re-installed. May the light of Christ always shine in our hearts. Amen ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>looked,</b> and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked,</b> {{behold the}} writing on it turned first to the colour of blood and then faded away, till {{presently}} {{there was nothing in}} my hand but a blank sheet of papyrus.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Antoinette {{stopped in}} the middle of the floor, facing the candle, her hands clasped, her eyes wide with fear. We started, Helene and I, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> at her.|$|R
6000|$|... "But we mustn't grumble, Max," [...] said Lumley to me, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> out of {{our small}} windows. [...] "We must take the evil with the good as it comes, and be thankful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Judge not, that ye be not judged!" [...] Those words sink {{deep into}} our hearts, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> our last upon the convent walls, {{and leave the}} living-dead at old Lanhearne.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wouldn't {{you really}} {{like to be a}} tenth Muse, then, Maggie?" [...] said Philip looking up in her face <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> at a first parting in the clouds that {{promises}} us a bright heaven once more.|$|E
60|$|What {{shall we}} see, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> across the broad, still, clear river, where the great dark trout sail {{to and fro}} lazily in the sun? For having free-warren of our fancy and our paper, we may see what we choose.|$|E
60|$|Together {{we pulled}} the unfortunate fellow {{from under the}} table, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> at his {{dripping}} head we exchanged glances, and I do not know which was the paler of the two.|$|R
6000|$|But {{his wife}} answered, 'Master, <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> upon that gazelle <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> upon you. It was the gazelle {{who came to}} ask me of my father, it was the gazelle who brought me from my father, and I was given in charge to the gazelle by my father.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ["The Marble Faun" [...] {{takes up}} this {{description}} {{of the church and}} of the dead monk, which we really saw, just as recounted, even to the sudden stream of blood which flowed from the nostrils, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> at him.-- ED.] ...|$|R
60|$|Kate {{sends her}} tender love; so does Georgy, so does Charlie, so does Mamey, so does Katey, so does Walter, {{so does the}} other one who is to be born next week. Look homeward always, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> abroad to you. God bless you, my dear Macready.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is merely}} this: that <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> {{back at the}} old {{competitive}} conditions {{we do not see}} how any man could be a gentleman in them, since a gentleman must think first of others, and these conditions compelled every man to think first of himself." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the lives}} of each one of us, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> back and review them in retrospect, there are certain desert wastes from which memory winces like some tired {{traveller}} faced with a dreary stretch of road. Even from the security of later happiness we cannot contemplate them without a shudder.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> {{turned to}} <b>look</b> in the {{direction}} from whence the first report had come, and there we saw, just clearing {{the tops of the}} nearer hills, a great battleship swinging majestically through the air. Her bow gun spoke again even <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked,</b> and another shell burst among the fleeing Warhoons.|$|R
5000|$|Led {{the agency}} {{through a process}} of {{strategic}} planning <b>as</b> <b>we</b> charted a course for the ecumenical and interfaith ministry of the United Methodist Church. This process involved an environmental scan and mapping for the future ecumenical agenda of the United Methodist Church. Our aim was to project the direction of the agency <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> forward 5-10 years.|$|R
60|$|She changed death-white, {{and heaved}} a cry: we'd never heard so grieved a cry As {{came from her}} at this from him: heart-broken quite seemed she; And suddenly, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> on, she turned, and rushed; and she was gone, Whither, her husband, {{following}} after, knew not; nor knew we.|$|R
60|$|Bridge Street {{brings us}} to the point at which we turned off at the {{termination}} of the High Street, and on the right-hand side <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> towards London is Church Street (formerly Windsor Street, according to Faulkner), leading up to the Ship Tavern, and thence into the King’s Road.|$|E
60|$|Dorriforth. Auberon hates generalizations. Nevertheless I make bold to {{say that}} we go to the theatre in the same spirit in which we read a novel, some of us to find one thing and some to find another; and {{according}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> for the particular thing we find it.|$|E
6000|$|... "My young friend," [...] he said, [...] "in {{the years}} to come you and I shall perhaps meet in our {{wonderful}} Paris, and if I may not tell the world so, I shall yet feel, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> upon her greatness, that you and I together have saved France. Adieu!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite all right," [...] we answered. We {{said good-bye}} very gently and passed out. <b>We</b> felt somehow <b>as</b> if <b>we</b> had touched a higher life. [...] "Such," [...] <b>we</b> murmured, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> about the ancient campus, [...] "are {{the men of}} science: are there, perhaps, any others of them round this morning that we might interview?" ...|$|R
60|$|An ominous, minute {{snapping}} noise {{came from}} the stern-line. Even <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked,</b> <b>we</b> saw a strand fray and part. Then we jumped. Scarcely had we bent another line between the stern and the wharf, when the original line parted. As we bent another line for'ard, the original one there crackled and parted. After that, it was an inferno of work and excitement.|$|R
60|$|About {{the middle}} of the {{afternoon}} of the fifty-eighth day we topped a low divide, and came in sight of the Stikeen River. Our hearts thrilled with pleasure <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> far over the deep blue and purple-green spread of valley, dim with mist, in which a little silver ribbon of water could be seen.|$|R
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> to France for {{the best}} coffee, so we must look to England for the {{perfection}} of tea. The tea-kettle is as much an English institution as aristocracy or the Prayer Book; and when one wants to know exactly how tea should be made, one has only to ask how a fine old English housekeeper makes it.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{chances of}} the sea, Captain Marble," [...] I said, greatly shocked {{at such an}} exhibition, coming from such a quarter--"the chances of the sea are {{sometimes}} {{too much for the}} best sailors. We should look at this loss, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> at the losses occasioned by a gale--then there is some hope left, after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you think}} it don't seem to be so in the State of Ohio. But I reckon it is, and so long <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> after our own souls, we can't do better than let others look after theirs in their own way. Come in and have some breakfast!" [...] He paused before his cabin with the young man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! that's the puzzler," [...] replied Bumpus, in a meditative way; [...] "but, of course, <b>we</b> must <b>look</b> out for puzzlers ahead {{sometimes}} w'en we {{gets into}} a land storm, d'ye see; just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looks</b> out ahead for breakers in a storm at sea. Suppose now that I creeps into the cave and listens for 'em. They'd never hear me, 'cause I'd make no noise." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{rapid changes}} in the music industry, driven by new {{technology}} and delivery models, posed many challenges for the service <b>as</b> <b>we</b> strived to stay relevant and to provide to users, for research or recreation, access to Australian music resources. The need to increase and {{to provide access to}} Australian digital music, both historical and contemporary, from printed music to the latest digital audio downloads, for users was a driving force <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> to improve our service.|$|R
60|$|A {{voice was}} now heard hailing {{us from the}} entrance. From the window {{we could see the}} figure of a man in the moonlight; he stood motionless, his face uplifted to ours, and a rag of {{something}} white on his extended arm; and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> right down upon him, though he was a good many yards distant on the links, we could see the moonlight glitter on his eyes.|$|R
60|$|These {{times of}} surpassing horror were also times of surpassing devotion and heroism. Without {{attempting}} {{to describe the}} various stages of the Revolution, and the different committees that under different titles carried {{on the work of}} destruction, we will mention some of the deeds that shine out <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> into that abyss of horror, the Paris of 1792 and the following years.|$|E
60|$|They were {{a people}} drunk with power and success, looking upon the other {{inhabitants}} of Mars <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> upon the beasts {{of the field}} and the forest. Why then should they not eat of the flesh of the lower orders whose lives and characters they no more understood than do we the inmost thoughts and sensibilities of the cattle we slaughter for our earthly tables.|$|E
6000|$|Here is what I {{have seen}} printed {{regarding}} the matter, and I will copy it lest any one think I may have imagined {{some portion of}} this contention, which, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> at the situation now, seems so improbable, for one can hardly believe that any officer in the patriot army would have refused {{at such a time}} to aid those who were so sorely pressed as were Gansevoort's troops: ...|$|E
60|$|These discoveries {{immediately}} determined us {{to abandon}} a place which had presented no inducement {{for us to}} remain, except the promise of security; and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> about us for the means of ascending again into the upper regions, we at last found a practicable part of the rock, and half-an-hour’s toil carried us to {{the summit of the}} same cliff from which the preceding evening we had descended.|$|R
60|$|She withdrew {{her hand}} timidly from his arm <b>as</b> <b>we</b> stopped {{to speak to}} them, and blushed as she gave it to Steerforth and to me. When they passed on, after we had {{exchanged}} a few words, {{she did not like}} to replace that hand, but, still appearing timid and constrained, walked by herself. I thought all this very pretty and engaging, and Steerforth seemed to think so too, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> after them fading away in the light of a young moon.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>looked</b> {{across the}} valley at the low ridge upon the further side, and saw a {{thousand}} little yellow points of flame with the dark smoke wreathing up in the heavy air. There was another farm-house on the further side of the valley, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> <b>we</b> suddenly saw a little group of horsemen appear on a knoll beside it and stare across at us. There were a dozen Hussars behind, and in front five men, three with helmets, one with a long straight red feather in his hat, and the last with a low cap.|$|R
