5|$|The first popular {{rock music}} bootleg {{resulted}} from Bob Dylan's activities between largely disappearing {{from the public}} eye after his motorcycle accident in 1966, {{and the release of}} John Wesley Harding at the end of 1967. After a number of artists had hits with Dylan songs that he had not officially recorded and released himself, demand increased for these recordings, particularly when they started airing on local radio in Los Angeles. Through various contacts in the radio industry, a number of pioneering bootleggers managed to buy a reel to reel tape containing a selection of unreleased Dylan songs intended for distribution for music publishers <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> {{it would be possible to}} manufacture them on an LP. They managed to convince a local pressing plant to press between 1,000 and 2,000 copies discreetly, paying in cash and avoiding using real names or addresses. Since the bootleggers could not commercially print a sleeve, due to it attracting too much attention from recording companies, the LP was issued in a plain white cover with Great White Wonder rubber stamped on it. Subsequently, Dylan became one of the most popular artists to be bootlegged with numerous releases.|$|E

County Executive Isiah Leggett, who supported the bill, said the fees would have helped close the budget gap and help fund improvements to the county's emergency services. Opponents of the bill were skeptical that insurance companies would pay the fees <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> the fees would reduce emergency service calls.|$|E

25|$|After {{travelling}} through France, {{he settled}} in Italy in 1666 - at first as professor of anatomy at the University of Padua {{and then in}} Florence as in-house physician of Grand Duke of Tuscany Ferdinando II de' Medici, who supported arts and science and whom Steno had met in Pisa. Steno was invited {{to live in the}} Palazzo Vecchio; in return he had to gather a cabinet of curiosities. Steno went to Rome and met Pope Alexander VII and Marcello Malpighi, whom he admired. On his way back he watched a Corpus Christi procession in Livorno <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> he had the right belief. In Florence Steno focused on the muscular system and the nature of muscle contraction. He became a member of Accademia del Cimento and had long discussions with Francesco Redi. Like Vincenzo Viviani, Steno proposed a geometrical model of muscles to show that a contracting muscle changes its shape but not its volume.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> I could not have done better.|$|E

500|$|Jordan Farley of SFX {{magazine}} gave [...] "Victory of the Daleks" [...] {{three and}} a half out of five stars, praising the redesigned Daleks for being [...] "equally intimidating" [...] and the episode [...] "rollicking good fun", though [...] "a little undercooked". However, he thought that the second half was [...] "a little rushed" [...] <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> the episode would have been more successful if it were a two-parter. He also was disappointed with a [...] "lack of quotable dialogue" [...] and less of the Doctor's [...] "playful banter and wacky mannerisms".|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} {{surprised}} at the length of [...] "A Farewell to Arms" [...] and [...] "Clenching the Fists of Dissent" [...] running over ten minutes, <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> their fans would [...] "be able to get their heads around" [...] what the band was doing. Record company Roadrunner Records hesitated the band's decision to open the album with a ten and a half minute song ("Clenching the Fists of Dissent"), and asked the band questions similar to [...] "Are you sure you don’t want to get into something a little more direct?" [...] The band disregarded the comment and believed the song set the tone musically {{for the remainder of the}} album.|$|E
500|$|Three {{years later}} on the Blond Ambition World Tour, [...] "Into the Groove" [...] was again {{performed}} before the encore. Madonna, her backup singers Niki Haris and Donna De Lory were portrayed as being seduced by three macho guys in leather jackets. The girls asked the guys to [...] "prove their love to them" [...] <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> they would wear a condom when necessary. After that, they sing the Shep Pettibone extended remix of [...] "Into The Groove". Two different performances were taped and released on video, the Blond Ambition– Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.|$|E

500|$|Ellis started Game 2 of the 1971 NLCS, {{earning the}} {{victory over the}} San Francisco Giants. During the series, Ellis created a stir by {{complaining}} about the Pirates' lodgings, complaining that the organization was [...] "cheap". He changed hotels because he said the hotel rooms were too small. Ellis started Game 1 of the 1971 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. In a losing effort, he lasted only [...] innings. He allowed four hits and four runs, including two home runs. Though Ellis denied being in pain before the game, he later acknowledged that elbow pain limited his performance, <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> his sickle cell trait {{could be related to}} this pain. The Pirates defeated the Orioles in seven games to win the World Series.|$|E
500|$|During {{the season}} Charlotte's storylines had mixed reactions. Jensen thought Charlotte and Faraday's {{mission to the}} Tempest in [...] "The Other Woman" [...] felt [...] "forced". Dan Compora from Airlock Alpha liked Charlotte and Juliet's fight scene in this episode. BuddyTV's Oscar Dahl thought the whole plot at the Tempest was [...] "filler" [...] <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> it had been added just to give Charlotte and Faraday {{something}} to do. After Charlotte speaks Korean in [...] "Something Nice Back Home", James Poniewozik from Time became curious about her past because she is [...] "the member of the four freighties whom we know the least about, and the most secretive and sinister-seeming of the bunch". Chris Carabott was also intrigued after this scene, which he called [...] "one of the more unexpected scenes".|$|E
500|$|Milk drifted from California to Texas to New York, {{without a}} steady job or plan. In New York City he became {{involved}} with O'Horgan's theater company as a [...] "general aide", signing on as associate producer for Lenny and for Eve Merriam's Inner City. The time he had spent with the cast of flower children wore away much of Milk's conservatism. A contemporary New York Times story about O'Horgan described Milk as [...] "a sad eyed man—another aging hippie with long, long hair, wearing faded jeans and pretty beads". Craig Rodwell read {{the description of the}} formerly uptight man <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> it could be the same person. One of Milk's Wall Street friends worried that he seemed to have no plan or future, but remembered Milk's attitude: [...] "I think he was happier than at any time I had ever seen him in his entire life." ...|$|E

500|$|On July 11, 2005, Hardy {{posted on}} his website {{that he was}} finally [...] "free", that wrestling fans {{had not seen the}} last of him, and that he had a {{surprise}} for the fans who had supported him. That night on Raw, Hardy attacked Edge backstage and again later during Edge's match with Kane, leaving the commentators speechless. Before being escorted out of the building by security, Hardy stated that Edge and Lita would pay for their actions and told fans that they could see him at Ring of Honor while security officials and event staff were trying to restrain him. Hardy also called out Johnny Ace as security had him in handcuffs taking him out of the arena. This caused an uproar amongst fans, who were confused <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> the whole thing was a work or a shoot. Similar occurrences repeated during the following two weeks.|$|E
500|$|In July 2009, {{the police}} {{installed}} {{closed circuit television}} (CCTV) cameras for [...] "safety and security". The police said that the cameras complemented the presence of their officers {{on the ground and}} did not record audio inputs. The move drew some negative reactions from the public. Former Nominated Member of Parliament Siew Kum Hong felt that the installation of CCTV cameras was [...] "pretty ridiculous", <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> the move might feed the perception in some quarters that Singapore is a police state, since Speakers' Corner is [...] "the one place in Singapore" [...] where people can demonstrate. Nevertheless, the cameras have not affected various events from being held. With effect from 1 December 2009, the size of Speakers' Corner was reduced so that it only occupies the half of Hong Lim Park nearer New Bridge Road. From 1 March 2012, Speakers' Corner was expanded to include an area behind Kreta Ayer NPP, near the junction of North Canal Road and South Bridge Road.|$|E
500|$|Richard Eder praised Any Human Heart in the New York Times: [...] "William Boyd, is {{multifaceted}} and inventive, and {{he plays}} a deep game under his agile card tricks." [...] Christopher Tayler, in the London Review of Books, called the characterisation of Mountstuart weak <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> he was merely a device through which Boyd could write pastiche about 20th-century writers, [...] "Boyd hustles you {{through to the end}} despite all this, but it’s hard not to wonder if it was really worth making the journey." [...] In The Atlantic Monthly, Brooke Allen liked the Mountstuart character: [...] "he is far more generous, forgiving, and free than most of us. He is also more amusing, and more amused by life", thus making an [...] "attractive central character" [...] and Boyd's writing showed [...] "a great natural vitality and an increasingly sophisticated humanism." [...] The Atlantic Monthly selected it as one of the [...] "books of the year".|$|E

500|$|Hex Enduction Hour was {{the first}} Fall album to make the UK Albums Chart, where it spent three weeks, peaking at no. 71. By mid-1983 it had sold 20,000 copies, {{reflecting}} a surge in the band's popularity, and five years into their career {{brought them to the}} attention of record labels. Critics were highly enthusiastic; according to Simon Ford, they could [...] "have hardly been more supportive". Reviewing the album in the NME, Richard Cook described the band as tighter and more disciplined than in earlier recordings, [...] "their master piece to date", while still maintaining their impact. He praised the band's use of recording-studio techniques and atmospherics without resorting to glamorisation. Melody Makers Colin Irwin said it was [...] "incredibly exciting and utterly compelling". [...] A dissenter was Neil McCormick of Irish fortnightly Hot Press, who dismissed the album as secondhand melodramatic punk <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> the album was [...] "meant to be minimalist or primitive then it fatally ignores the true primitivism of the strong melody and accessible lyrics found in folk music." ...|$|E
500|$|By contrast, Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan {{offered a}} mixed opinion of 5.9 out of 10, stating that {{on its own}} the album is good, but it pales in {{comparison}} to an album like High on Fire's Snakes for the Divine. PopMatters scored the record 5 out of 10 stars <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> RCA's instincts were right in regards to the album's lack of [...] "catchier" [...] material, as Adrien Begrand said that Heppner's vocals were in general weaker on this album as compared to the band's previous record. Nonetheless, he did compliment Vince Nudo for his vocals on [...] "Lunar", which he favorably compared to Black Sabbath, and also compared [...] "Lady Killer" [...] to Judas Priest. The Boston Phoenix reviewer Mikael Wood gave the album a star and a half out of four, and wrote that despite the cleverness behind the album's title, the songs within were empty, and while fans of the style would be comfortable with it, [...] "Everybody else should seek out Hello Master." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Wright of The Stage gave a {{favourable}} {{review of}} the episode. He referred to his review of [...] "Midnight", {{when he said that}} it was Davies' best script so far <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> Davies would better it with the last three episodes, and wrote that the episode [...] "possibly just nudges ahead" [...] of [...] "Midnight". Wright explained that [...] "Turn Left" [...] struck resonance with him because the episode highlighted how important the Doctor is to the fictional universe. His review praised Tate's acting as Donna before she met the Doctor as a [...] "real character performance" [...] which exemplified Tate's multi-faceted portrayal. His main points of criticism were the appearance of Rose and the Time Beetle prosthetic: he was [...] "non-plussed" [...] about Rose's reappearance, but he admitted that Piper was an [...] "integral part of the early success of new Who"; and he thought the prosthetic beetle was [...] "an unconvincing lump of plastic" [...] and was reminiscent of the classic series' low budget. He closed his review by saying the episode [...] "says as much about Doctor Who’s past as well as its future", and looked forward to the last two episodes of the series.|$|E
