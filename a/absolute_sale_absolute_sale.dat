Since the early 1960s Vauxhalls, whilst being designed and built in the United Kingdom, increasingly shared their general specification, engineering features and styling with Opel counterparts (the Viva with the Kadett and the Victor with the Rekord, for instance) even if the two cars were distinct, with few to any interchangeable parts. From the late 1960s and into the early 1970s increasing economic turmoil in the UK, declining build quality and increasing strike action throughout British industry (and, in stark contrast, the 'Wirtschaftswunder' or 'economic miracle' of West Germany during the same period), plus the entry of the UK into the European Economic Community in 1973, made maintaining two parallel model lines serving similar markets increasingly undesirable. The FE Series Victor, launched in 1972, would be the last all-British Vauxhall. Following the introduction of the Chevette and Cavalier virtually all future Vauxhalls would be lightly-restyled Opels (the exceptions would be based on models from elsewhere in the GM organisation). However Vauxhall would retain its two British factories at Luton and Ellesmere Port, with most cars wearing the Vauxhall badge still being built in the UK.|$|R
30|$|As {{with the}} NL case, PHEV follows a {{different}} uptake path to BEV. All scenarios but Base and Scenario UK_ 3 {{have a reasonable}} correlation with the observed sales growth up to 2012, but fail to account for a sales stagnation in 2013. This {{would seem to be}} a trend also observed in BEV and NL case BEV – a fall or stagnation in the second year of sales. Although it was previously suggested that this may be due to the entry of PHEV, it may also be that there is a peak in the first year of sales as a new entry into the market, and the excitement is not sustained in the next year. There may of course be other explanations for this, such as an uncaptured uncertainty of policies or the actions of “early adopters” which are not currently captured in the PTTMAM as markets are not segmented. From 2013 to 2015, UK_ 3 – 5 and UK_ 9, which include a PHEV congestion charge exemption, seem to exhibit a similar growth trend to the observed data. The other scenarios (other than Base which has growth close to zero), all have rather lower sales growth rates than the observed data, though in 2014 the <b>absolute</b> <b>sales</b> are similar.

On the other hand, it was the intention to part with the lots of Mooseridge in fee.

30|$|For BEV, all {{scenarios}} {{other than}} the base {{would seem to have}} a close fit to the actual UK figures between 2010 and 2011. Scenario UK_ 3 has the closest correlation in the early years, though the remaining scenarios are somewhat lower (which may be explained by an under-estimated demand kick). Between 2011 and 2012, observed sales would seem to stagnate, which is not captured in any of our scenarios. One reason for this deviation could be similar to that discussed in the NL case, that the PTTMAM is not sophisticated enough at present to account for the introduction of the competitor powertrain PHEV in 2012. Though if this were the case then the model may under-predict in later years. Due to this stagnation however, the scenarios other than UK_ 3 and UK_Base have similar sales shares in 2012. Scenarios UK_ 1, UK_ 2, and UK_ 6 – UK_ 13, where PHEV do not have congestion charge exemption, display a very similar growth rate to the observed data between 2012 and 2013 whereas Scenarios UK_ 4 – 8 all marginally over predict due to the earlier impact of the congestion charge exemption. This has led to an observed sales share in 2013 that is between these two groups of scenarios. A strong growth rate between 2013 and 2014 has led to even higher sales than all of these scenarios, and is close to the sales that year captured in UK_ 3. Although growth rate of Scenarios UK_ 10 – 13 are closest to the observed during this period, they still under predict as the exemption impacts later in the time period, from 2014. Clearly there may be some uncaptured behaviour or policy causing this. During the final period, 2014 – 15, the sales growth of all Scenarios UK_ 3 – 13 are similar to the observed growth, though with lower <b>absolute</b> <b>sales</b> due to earlier success in the observed data. The scenarios that include infrastructure subsidies and additional demand kicks make very little impact on the results. This is not surprizing. Firstly, as already observed in the discussion of the NL case, provision of public charging infrastructure would not be expected to have major impact on early uptake. Secondly, the home charging subsidy is a minor portion of the overall vehicle price (around 2 % of a c.€ 40, 000 purchase). Finally, the demand kick from the taxes does not have the same impact as in the NL case as these taxes are a much smaller portion of the cost in the UK. Despite no direct match, based on these observations, scenarios UK_ 10 – 13 all show similar trends to the observed data {{that could be used to}} represent the real world.|$|R

40|$|Sales {{contests}} {{are commonly}} used by firms as a short-term motivational device to increase salespeople's efforts. Conceptually sales contests and piece-rate schemes, such as salary, commission, or quotas, differ in that in sales contests payment to salespeople is based on relative rather than <b>absolute</b> <b>sales</b> levels. Using the agency theoretic framework where the firm is risk neutral and the salespeople are risk averse, we examine how a firm should design an optimal contest to maximize its profit through stimulating salespeople's efforts. Specifically we investigate how many salespeople should be given awards and how the reward should be allocated between the winners. Three commonly used sales contest formats are studied. In the first format, termed as Rank-Order Tournament, there are many winners {{and the amount of}} reward is based on relative rank achieved, with larger amounts awarded to higher ranks. We also examine two special cases of Rank-Ordered Tournament: a Multiple-Winners format, where the reward is shared equally, and a Winner-Take-All format, where a single winner gets the entire reward. We model salespeople's behavior by considering utility of the reward from achieving one of the winning ranks in the contest and assessing incremental chances of winning by exerting mole effort. The analysis was done for two situations based on whether the total reward is large enough for salespeople to participate in the effort-maximizing sales contest or not. The analysis shows that factors impacting contest design include the salespeople's degree of risk aversion,number of salespeople competing in the contest, and degree of sales uncertainty (which reflects strength of the sales-effort relationship). The results show that salespeople exert lower effort when there are larger numbers of participants or when sales uncertainty is high. We find that the Rank-Order Tournament is superior to the Multiple-Winners contest format. In a Multiple-Winners format, the salesperson whose performance is just sufficient to win is better off {{than any of the other}} winners as he exerts the least effort to win but obtains as high a reward as any other winners. Specific recommendations on contest designs are obtained assuming that sales follow either a logistic or uniform distribution. Assuming that sales outcome is logistically distributed and the contest budget is high enough to ensure participation, our analysis shows that the total number of winners in a sales contest should not exceed half the number of the contestants. This result is due to the symmetric nature of the logistic distribution. Our analysis also indicates that the total number of winners should be increased and the spread decreased when salespeople are more risk averse. When salespeople are more risk averse, their marginal values for higher rewards become smaller The spread should increase with ranks when rate of risk tolerance is high and decrease with ranks when the rate of risk tolerance is lower. in the extreme case of risk-neutral salespeople, the optimal design is a Winner-Take-All format. We also conclude that since the probability of winning the contest decreases with number of contestants, the optimal number of winners should increase and interrank spread decrease when there are a larger number of participants, if the firm does not allocate a large enough budget for salespeople to participate in the effort-maximizing sales contest, then the firm may increase the number of winners to more than half the sales-force, increasing the number of winners and decreasing the spread are required to encourage the salespeople to participate, particularly when there are many participants who are risk averse. A counterintuitive result is that the number of winners should be reduced and the spread increased when sales uncertainty is high. Increasing sales uncertainty leads to lower equilibrium effort levels while keeping the expected utility of the contest rewards the same. Therefore, increased uncertainty results in higher participation incentive. The firm should thus relatively reduce the number of winners in high-uncertainty situations. Under the assumption of uniformly distributed sales, the recommendation is that a Winner-Take-All contest induces maximum efforts regardless of the level of risk aversion, number of players, or the degree of uncertainty. When the Winner-Take-All format does not meet the participation constraint, our analysis recommends offering a big reward to the top salesperson and a small reward to many other salespeople. The small reward should be just sufficient to ensure that all salespeople participate. Consistent with logistic distribution, the spread should decrease when salespeople are more risk averse or there are more players but should increase when sales uncertainty is larger These results highlight that some of the conclusions drawn may be sensitive to distributional assumptions...|$|R

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the level of awareness of the informal indigenous livestock grading and pricing system among producers and the exploitation of this knowledge to increase market participation and realise better prices and returns for their animals. Data was collected from 144 small ruminant producers in 3 livelihood zones (West Golis pastoral, Togdheer agro-pastoral and Hawd pastoral regions) in the northern Togdheer region using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and econometric methods {{were used in the}} analysis of data. Results confirmed the importance of small ruminants as sources of income among livestock producers in Somaliland. On average, a household kept 53 sheep and goats with most of the producers (79 - 85 %) having sold some animals (mean= 10) during the preceding 12 months. It was also established that producers were generally well versed with the grading and pricing system except for the very fine details. However, this knowledge did not have significant effect on level of market participation, but rather, other supply influencing factors like the number of animals kept by the household, gender of sales decision maker, age of household head and livelihood zone in which the household resided significantly influenced household annual small ruminants sales volumes. Despite level of awareness of grading and pricing having no significant effect on the <b>absolute</b> annual household <b>sales</b> volumes due to other adjunct supply constraints, producers tended to avail more of the superior quality grades for sale. For example, Grades I and II of small ruminants accounted for the largest proportions of animals sold (40 % and 29 %, respectively) with inferior quality grades (grade III and the local grade) accounting for only 15 % and 17 % respectively. Furthermore, results of an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression showed that supply of higher grade animals had a positive effect on prices received. In addition, number of animals sold and involvement in other economic activities besides livestock production positively affected the level of prices received by producers. Although a significant number of producers (39 %) said that they deliberately fatten animals before sale, the strategy employed simply involved grazing of animals in communal land during the rainy season. Sheep and goats producers in Somalia face formidable constraints of drought and the attendant lack of feed and water for livestock, and also animal health issues. This provides a justification for development agencies and research organisations to continue working to address these problems. Danish International Development Agenc...|$|R
