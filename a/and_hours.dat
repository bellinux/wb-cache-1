5|$|August 13, 2004– Hurricane Charley makes {{landfall}} on Cayo Costa with {{winds of}} 150mph (240km/h) <b>and</b> <b>hours</b> later hits the mainland {{portion of the}} state at Punta Gorda, becoming the strongest hurricane to hit the United States since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The winds damage or destroy thousands of homes, knock down {{tens of thousands of}} trees, and leave more than 2million Floridians without power. Charley results in eightdirect fatalities, 20indirect casualties, and 792reported injuries. Throughout the state, damage is estimated at $13.5billion (2004USD, $17.5billion 2017USD), at the time the second costliest hurricane in United States history; it has since dropped to sixth.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, state Sen. Joseph F. Timilty {{resigned}} his Norfolk and Suffolk seat {{to pursue}} a career in private law, and Keating became the only major Democratic contender for the office. In the general election he faced Republican Marion Boch, who promoted a plan for dramatic cuts to legislators' pay <b>and</b> <b>hours,</b> invoking the energy of the Ronald Reagan campaign. Keating focused his campaign on expanding resources for crime prevention and education, tailoring his message to the Boston constituency he would pick up as a senator. He was successful, winning about 64 percent of the vote, and was sworn in the following January.|$|E

Derek intends to report Lisa to his firm's human resource management, but learns that she has quit her job. Thinking that Lisa has given up, Derek is annoyed when he receives flirtatious emails from her. Derek and his workmates visit a resort for a conference, where he spots and confronts Lisa, who spikes his drink. Incapacitated, Derek is helpless when Lisa follows him into his hotel room. He confronts Lisa again the following day, <b>and</b> <b>hours</b> later discovers her lying naked in his bed after attempting suicide by drug overdose, and calls for medical help.|$|E

5|$|Due to its sudden {{development}} and project track into southwest Florida, the National Hurricane Center issued {{a tropical storm}} warning <b>and</b> <b>hours</b> later a hurricane warning from the Dry Tortugas to Marathon in the Florida Keys and along the southwestern coastline northward to Fort Myers. A hurricane watch was also issued from Marathon to Jupiter Inlet. At {{the time of the}} issuance of the hurricane warning, Alberto had been moving steadily northeastward; extrapolating its motion indicated a landfall on Key West within 12hours and a mainland landfall at Key Largo within 24hours. Additionally, most computer models predicted Alberto to continue northeastward across south Florida. Only one model, not available until later, suggested a weakness in steering currents that would prevent a Florida landfall.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{plagued by}} {{political}} missteps and personal scandals, {{the administration of}} Republican Acting Governor of Massachusetts Jane Swift appeared vulnerable, and many Republicans viewed her as unable to win a general election. Prominent party figures– {{as well as the}} White House– wanted Romney to run for governor and the opportunity appealed to him for reasons including its national visibility. A poll by the Boston Herald showed Republicans favoring Romney over Swift by more than 50percentage points. On March 19, 2002, Swift announced she would not seek her party's nomination, <b>and</b> <b>hours</b> later Romney declared his candidacy, for which he would face no opposition in the primary. In June 2002, the Massachusetts Democratic Party challenged Romney's eligibility to run for governor, noting that state law required seven years' consecutive residence and that Romney had filed his state tax returns as a Utah resident in 1999 and 2000. In response, the bipartisan Massachusetts State Ballot Law Commission unanimously ruled that he had maintained sufficient financial and personal ties to Massachusetts and was, therefore, an eligible candidate.|$|E
5|$|Late on August4, the {{intensity}} of Felicia led to it taking a more northward turn {{in response to a}} mid- to upper-level trough off the coast of the Western United States. Early the next morning, the storm continued to intensify and attained Category 3 status with winds of 115mph (185km/h). Maintaining a well-defined eye, Felicia neared Category 4 status <b>and</b> <b>hours</b> later, the storm attained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a pressure of 937mbar (hPa; 27.67inHg) during the evening hours, making it the strongest Pacific storm east of the International Date Line since Hurricane Ioke in 2006 and the strongest in the eastern Pacific basin since Hurricane Daniel of 2006. Around 5:00pm PDT (0000UTC August6) Felicia reached its peak intensity with winds of 145mph (230km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 935mbar (hPa; 27.61inHg).|$|E

5|$|Located to {{the south}} of a mid-level ridge, the {{depression}} moved to the west-northwest. With weak to moderate upper-level wind shear over the system, the depression gradually organized, and intensified into Tropical Storm Erin on September 2. Though Erin had favorable upper-level outflow and developing convection, the inner core of the storm remained disorganized. The storm slowly strengthened, and attained an initial peak intensity of 60mph (95km/h) while located about 1,150miles (1,855km) east of the Lesser Antilles. Favorable conditions were expected to allow Erin to continue to strengthen to reach winds of 85mph (135km/h). However, an upper-level low to the northwest of Erin produced strong vertical shear over the storm, and Erin quickly weakened as the low-level circulation became exposed {{to the south}}west of the deep convection. The shear slightly abated on September 4, allowing Erin to briefly re-strengthen. However, the storm remained disorganized, and following an increase in southwesterly wind shear Erin began a weakening trend. On September 5, Erin weakened to a tropical depression, <b>and</b> <b>hours</b> later the low-level circulation dissipated.|$|E
5|$|The victor in {{the tale}} is the farmer's wife: she regains her errant duck and is {{rid of the}} predatory fox. Ostensibly, she confiscates Jemima's eggs believing Jemima will abandon them, but the eggs are not confiscated for the {{well-being}} of Jemima and her kin but {{for the well-being of}} the farmer's wife and her family: the eggs (or the ducks hatched from them) will end up on their dinner table. In this respect, the farmer's wife is a predator like the fox, but the fox is condemned for his predation. Human values are {{at the top of the}} tale's hierarchy. Potter argues for the well-ordered home and the practicalities of farm life over the fantasy lives of animals. It was the modus vivendi Potter was to incorporate in her own life as she devoted more of her thoughts <b>and</b> <b>hours</b> to the business of farming and less to tales of fantasy animals.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Irene {{strengthened}} as {{it moved}} northward, and reached maximum sustained winds of 70mph (115km/h) early on October 14. Operationally, Irene was upgraded to a hurricane on October 14, although later analysis after the hurricane season indicated it remained a tropical storm until later. Irene continued to move towards the north-northeast, crossed over the western portion of the Isla de la Juventud as a strong tropical storm, <b>and</b> <b>hours</b> later, it struck mainland Cuba near Batabano. The storm was able to strengthen further over the Florida Straits, and Irene attained hurricane status on October 15. It passed over Key West, turned more to the north-northeast, and struck mainland Florida at Cape Sable as an 80mph (130km/h) hurricane.|$|E
