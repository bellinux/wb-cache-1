Despite his short stature, he is a skilled rugby player, often getting the better of Wal. Rangi's father is an {{abattoir}} slaughterman and his mother teaches at Raupo School. In his first appearance, Rangi considers skinning the Dog to make a fur coat. As a testimony to Murray Ball's skill as an artist, the character of Rangi grew up over the years, appearing slightly older in each book from being <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid</b> to a teenager. First appearance: Book 4 (April 1981).|$|E

That's a horrifying image to throw at <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid.</b> You really could almost think that your talking in line, say, was on a par with killing Jesus." ...|$|E

[...] "Protect Ya Neck" [...] is a free-associative and braggadocious battle rap featuring eight of the nine Wu-Tang members, and [...] "Tearz" [...] tells stories of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid</b> getting shot (RZA's little brother), and another one who contracts HIV after having unprotected sex. They were independently released as the [...] "Protect Ya Neck"/"After the Laughter Comes Tears" [...] single, which RZA financed by demanding $100 (USD) from each rapper who wanted a verse on the A-side.

The lyrics are typically surreal and offbeat; Deal's main {{inspiration for the}} song and its title was a discarded art book she found on a New York City street while on tour in the late 1990s. She later described the book: [...] "From the handwriting, you could tell that this book must have belonged to <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid.</b> This kid had written a short story, a paragraph really, about a party {{that took place in}} another universe, about people and monsters that were partying together.

Speaking in 2009, she {{reflected}} {{that they were}} close because sex was never an issue for them. Although the headlines in the media referred to Shields' talking about an [...] "asexual Jackson" [...] after his death, what she actually said was, “As he grew older and the more he started to change physically, the more asexual he became to me.” She also said that as she grew up and started having boyfriends, she would confide in him about her intimate experiences, as he was curious. She said, [...] "he was like <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid</b> who talked about the bases – what first base was, what second base was" [...] – and his curiosity was understandable given his guarded life.|$|E
500|$|Illmatic {{contains}} discerning {{treatment of}} its subject matter: gang rivalries, desolation, and {{the ravages of}} urban poverty. Nas, who was twenty years old when the album was released, focuses on depicting his own experiences, creating highly detailed first-person narratives that deconstruct the troubled life of an inner city teenager. One writer describes {{the theme of the}} album as a “tory of a gifted writer born into squalor, trying to claw {{his way out of the}} trap. It's somewhere between The Basketball Diaries and Native Son….” The narratives featured in Illmatic originate from Nas's own experiences as an adolescent growing up in Queensbridge, as the lyrics allude to the housing projects located in the Long Island City-section of Queens, New York. Nas said in an interview in 2001: “When I made Illmatic I was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid</b> in Queensbridge trapped in the ghetto. My soul was trapped in Queensbridge projects.” In a 2012 interview, he explained his inspiration for exploring this subject matter: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} substantial criticism for its strong violence and language. One scene that viewers found particularly unnerving was the ear-cutting scene; Madsen himself reportedly had great difficulty finishing it, especially after Kirk Baltz ad-libbed the desperate plea [...] "I've got <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid</b> at home." [...] Many people walked {{out during the}} film. During a screening at Sitges Film Festival, fifteen people walked out, including horror film director Wes Craven and special makeup effects artist Rick Baker. Baker later told Tarantino to take the walkout as a [...] "compliment" [...] and explained that he found the violence unnerving because of its heightened sense of realism. Tarantino commented {{about it at the}} time: [...] "It happens at every single screening. For some people the violence, or the rudeness of the language, is a mountain they can't climb. That's OK. It's not their cup of tea. But I am affecting them. I wanted that scene to be disturbing." ...|$|E
500|$|Mulan {{served as}} Wen's first voice-acting role. In an {{interview}} with IGN, the actress elaborated on the recording process, specifically {{the fact that she}} was required to record the majority of the character's dialogue in isolation, saying, [...] "I just loved the story so much and identified so much with the character of Mulan it was easy for me. I loved using my imagination. I felt like I was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid</b> again, being silly with an imaginary sword and riding on an imaginary horse and talking to an imaginary dragon. So it was a lot of fun for me." [...] In spite of the fact that, throughout the film, Mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian, a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, Wen and her co-star never actually encountered each other while working on Mulan due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations.|$|E

[...] According to Safire in a 2007 column, Moore stuck his head into the compartment occupied by Nixon's speechwriters and stated, [...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid</b> out there with a hand-lettered sign that I think says 'Bring Us Together'."

500|$|The {{episode was}} written to humanize Sawyer {{and set up}} the love {{triangle}} between him, Kate and Jack. Kate was meant to look at Sawyer in a new way, and, according to Lindelof, think, [...] "wow, this guy is not just a belligerent." [...] The episode also shows the moral ambiguity of some characters by revealing more of their personalities, with the ones introduced as protagonists doing things that are generally not viewed as protagonist-like– an example being Jack beating Sawyer and eventually asking Sayid to torture him; and an antagonistic character, Sawyer, proving not to be solely antagonist-like– an example being his backstory and flashback, which show that he is not exclusively evil. Lindelof explained that he wanted Sawyer to [...] "come out of his shell a little, and say to the audience, 'you're supposed to like this guy'", further explaining, [...] "the root of him being an asshole is that these horrible things happened to him when he was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid,</b> and he's really really angry." ...|$|E
500|$|Up is {{the third}} Pixar film to be scored by Michael Giacchino, after The Incredibles and Ratatouille. What Pete Docter wanted most {{importantly}} out of the music was the emotion, so Giacchino wrote a character theme-based score that producer Jonas Rivera thought enhanced the story. At {{the beginning of the}} movie, when young Carl is in the movie theater watching a newsreel about Muntz, the first piece of music heard is [...] "Muntz's Theme", which starts out as a celebratory theme, and echoes through the film when Muntz reappears 70years later. [...] "Ellie's Theme" [...] is first heard when she is introduced as <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid</b> and plays several times during the film in different versions; for instance, during the sequence where Carl lifts his house with the balloons, the theme is changed from a simple piano melody to a full orchestral arrangement.

500|$|After Thomas G. W. Settle's record {{flight in}} the Piccards Century of Progress, the balloon was again {{returned}} to the Piccards, who decided to fly it to the stratosphere on their own. Jean would concentrate on the science, while Jeannette would pilot the balloon. DeVorkin wrote that, [...] "Energetic and forceful, {{she seemed to have}} a better chance of obtaining a pilot's license than Jean, who was preoccupied with restoring the gondola and balloon and convincing scientists to provide instruments to fly". She studied at Ford Airport in Dearborn, Michigan under Edward J. Hill, a balloonist and Gordon Bennett Cup winner, who agreed to serve as flight director for the Piccards' planned stratospheric flight. Henry Ford offered the use of his hangar and brought Orville Wright (with his brother Wilbur, inventor of the airplane and first human to fly a heavier-than-air powered aircraft) to observe a flight of Jeannette's in 1933. Her son Don was a crew member that day and shook hands with Wright, [...] "I was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid</b> and he [...] attention to me." [...] On June 16, 1934, Jeannette flew her first solo flight. Later that year, the National Aeronautic Association made her the first woman licensed balloon pilot in the U.S. Auguste wrote to Jean in June 1934, [...] "Hopefully you will make your flight ahead of other competitors.

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E minor, with Scherzinger's vocal range spanning from low-note of E3 to the high-note of G5. Lyrically, the song is centered around {{the desire to be}} famous when one grows up. Using satirical and autobiographical lines, Scherzinger begins the song's first verse with: [...] "Now I've got a confession / When I was young I wanted attention". The [...] "repetitive and catchy chorus" [...] follows, where she sings the lines: [...] "When I grow up / I wanna be famous / I wanna be a star / I wanna be in movies". MTV News commented that the song contains a theme that is [...] "getting plenty of traction these days – beware the high cost of fame." [...] Meanwhile, group member Melody Thornton said of the song's concept: [...] "If you strive for higher and bigger things – along with that – comes hard work and dealing with a lot of stuff that you'd never assume you'd have to. So yeah, while the song is meant to be playful, it still does have that little warning twist to it". Bill Lamb from About.com named [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] a possible answer song to Pink's [...] "Stupid Girls" [...] (2006). Music critics were initially confused by the line [...] "I wanna have groupies" [...] in the chorus; mistaking the line as saying [...] "I wanna have boobies". American comedian Ellen DeGeneres also pointed this out when they performed the song on her talk show on September 23, 2008. Nicole Scherzinger said that [...] "All of us started with a dream...I know when I was young, and I would sign people's notebooks, I wrote, 'Remember me when I'm famous,' and I don't know of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid</b> who hasn't aspired to be someone" ...|$|E
