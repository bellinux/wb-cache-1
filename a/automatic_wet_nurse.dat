5000|$|<b>Wet</b> <b>nursing</b> was {{reported}} in France {{in the time of}} Louis XIV, the early 17th century. In 18th century France, approximately 90 percent of infants were <b>wet</b> <b>nursed,</b> mostly sent away to live with their <b>wet</b> <b>nurses.</b> The high demand for <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> coincided with the low wages and high rent prices of this era, which forced many women to have to work soon after childbirth. This meant that many mothers had to send their infants away to be breastfed and cared for by <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> even more poor than themselves. With the high demand for <b>wet</b> <b>nurses,</b> the price to hire one increased as the standard of care decreased. This led to many infant deaths. In response, rather than nursing their own children, upper class women turned to hiring <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> to come live with them instead. In entering into their employers home to care for their charges, these <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> had to leave their own infants to be nursed and cared for by women far worse off than themselves, and who likely lived at a relatively far distance away. The Bureau of <b>Wet</b> <b>Nurses</b> was created in Paris, 1769, to serve two main purposes; it supplied parents with <b>wet</b> <b>nurses,</b> as well as helped lessen the neglect of charges by controlling monthly salary payments to <b>wet</b> <b>nurses.</b> In order to become a <b>wet</b> <b>nurse,</b> women had to meet a few qualifications including a good physical body with a good moral character, they were often judged on their age, their health, the number of children they had, as well as their breast shape, breast size, breast texture, nipple shape and nipple size, since all these aspects were believed to affect the quality of a woman's milk. In 1874, the French government introduced the Roussel Law, which [...] "mandated that every infant placed with a paid guardian outside the parents’ home be registered with the state so that the French government is able to monitor how many children are placed with <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> and how many <b>wet</b> <b>nursed</b> children have died." ...|$|R
40|$|Breastfeeding and <b>wet</b> <b>nursing</b> {{have been}} synonymous since ancient times. Each civilization has carved out its own history {{regarding}} <b>wet</b> <b>nursing.</b> This article overviews the historical aspect on how <b>wet</b> <b>nursing</b> began and survived {{the times and}} briefly {{look at it from}} the perspective of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Also included are factors affecting <b>wet</b> <b>nursing</b> services, that is, social class; occupation; maternal debility; family and friendship ties; as well as myths and taboos. The characteristics of an ideal <b>wet</b> <b>nurse</b> are also discussed from the physical aspects; milk; nutrition; emotion; morality and behaviour. The selection of <b>wet</b> <b>nurse</b> in the form of physical, milk and nutrition are easier to identified. At the same time, characteristics of morality and behaviour is more important to ensure that the life of an infant becomes more pleasant. It is generally believed that children inherit physical and mental features from the source of the milk they consume. Thus, parents are advised to be more mindful in selecting a <b>wet</b> <b>nurse...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Breastfeeding is {{the natural}} means by which a baby {{receives}} nourishment. In most societies women usually feed their own babies, being the most natural, convenient and cost effective method of feeding a baby. However there are situations when a mother could not suckle her own baby, for example she may have died, become unwell or otherwise could not provide breast milk for her baby. Before the availability of infant formula, in those situations, unless a <b>wet</b> <b>nurse</b> was found promptly, the baby may die, and infant mortality rates were very high. <b>Wet</b> <b>nurses</b> were {{a normal part of}} the social order, though social attitudes to <b>wet</b> <b>nursing</b> varied, {{as well as to the}} social status of the <b>wet</b> <b>nurse.</b> Attitudes to breastfeeding itself began to be seen as common; too common to be done by royalty, even in ancient societies, and <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> were employed to breastfeed the children of royal families. This attitude extended over time, particularly in western Europe, where babies of noble women were often <b>nursed</b> by <b>wet</b> <b>nurses.</b> Lower-class women breastfed their infants and used a <b>wet</b> <b>nurse</b> only if they were unable to feed their own infant.|$|R
40|$|The {{historical}} evolution of infant feeding includes <b>wet</b> <b>nursing,</b> the feeding bottle, and formula use. Before {{the invention of}} bottles and formula, <b>wet</b> <b>nursing</b> was the safest and most common alternative to the natural mother's breastmilk. Society's negative view of <b>wet</b> <b>nursing,</b> combined with improvements of the feeding bottle, the availability of animal's milk, and advances in formula development, gradually led to the substitution of artificial feeding for <b>wet</b> <b>nursing.</b> In addition, the advertising and safety of formula products increased their popularity and use among society. Currently, infant formula-feeding is widely practiced in the United States and appears {{to contribute to the}} development of several common childhood illnesses, including atopy, diabetes mellitus, and childhood obesity...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} explore <b>wet</b> <b>nursing</b> in Australia {{at the turn}} of the century. At a time when {{maternal}} breastfeeding was 'problematised', and bottle feeding led to alarming death rates of infants, <b>wet</b> <b>nursing</b> was believed to be a sound option for the rearing of children. While the <b>wet</b> <b>nurse</b> is a shadowy figure, a reading of contemporary medical texts and journals uncovers some of the requirements and demands of her employment, and some of the belief systems that sustained it. Throughout, the surveillance of the medical profession over breastfeeding and <b>wet</b> <b>nursing</b> is clear, and the mother-child bond denigrated in favour of a scientific and medicalised feeding. Through an examination of feeding and the <b>wet</b> <b>nurse,</b> the changing social relationship between the mother and child can be considered, in a period when the health and survival of the child was increasingly prioritised over the well being and desires of the mother. 6 page(s...|$|R

50|$|Nurse empress dowager (Chinese language: 保太后; pinyin Bǎo Tàihòu) was an honorific title {{given to}} emperors' <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> during the Chinese/Xianbei dynasty Northern Wei. The {{existence}} of the title owed itself to a peculiar institution of Northern Wei—that when a son of the emperor were to be made crown prince, his mother, if alive, must be forced to commit suicide. The crown princes were therefore raised by <b>wet</b> <b>nurses,</b> and when they became emperors, they would typically honor their <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> as nurse empress dowagers. Often, later in their reigns, they would then honor their <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> as full empress dowagers, and they often had just as much influence as the emperors' mothers would have had—rendering {{the rationale for the}} Northern Wei institution of putting mothers to death (that therefore empress dowagers would not dominate the political scene) somewhat ineffective.|$|R
50|$|A <b>wet</b> <b>nurse</b> {{can help}} when a baby's natural mother is unable or elects not {{to feed the}} infant. Before the {{development}} of baby formulas in the 20th century, when a mother was unable to breastfeed her baby, the baby's life was put in danger if a <b>wet</b> <b>nurse</b> was not available. There are many reasons why a mother is unable to lactate or to produce sufficient breast milk. Reasons include the serious or chronic illness of the mother and her treatment which creates a temporary difficulty to nursing. Additionally, a mother's taking drugs (prescription or recreational) may necessitate a <b>wet</b> <b>nurse</b> if a drug in any way changes {{the content of the}} mother's milk. There was also an increased need for <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> under circumstances when the rates of infant abandonment by mothers, and maternal death during childbirth, were high. Some women choose not to breastfeed for social reasons. Many of these women were found to be of the upper class. For them, breastfeeding was considered unfashionable, {{in the sense that it}} not only prevented these women from being able to wear the fashionable clothing of their time but it was also thought to ruin their figures. Mothers also lacked the support of their husbands to breastfeed their children, since hiring a <b>wet</b> <b>nurse</b> was less expensive than having to hire someone else to help run the family business and/or take care of the family household duties in their place. Some women chose to hire <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> purely to escape from the confining and time-consuming chore of breastfeeding. <b>Wet</b> <b>nurses</b> have also been used when a mother cannot produce sufficient breast milk, i.e., the mother feels incapable of adequately nursing her child, especially following multiple births. <b>Wet</b> <b>nurses</b> tend to be more common in places where maternal mortality is high.|$|R
5000|$|English colonists {{brought the}} {{practice}} of <b>wet</b> <b>nursing</b> with them to North America. Since the arrangement of sending infants away to live with <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> {{was the cause of}} so many infant deaths, by the 19th century, Americans adopted {{the practice of}} having <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> live with the employers in order to nurse and care for their charges. This practice had the effect of increasing the death rate for wet nurses' own, biological infants. Many employers would have only kept a <b>wet</b> <b>nurse</b> for a few months at a time since it was believed that the quality of a woman's breast milk would lessen over time. Since there were not any official records kept pertaining to <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> or <b>wet</b> <b>nursed</b> children in the United States, historians lack the knowledge of precisely how many infants were wet-nursed, for how long they were wet-nursed, whether they lived at home or else where while they wet-nursed, as well as how many wet-nursed babies lived or died. The only evidence which exists, pertaining to wet-nursing in the United States is found in the help wanted ads of newspapers, through complaints about <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> in magazines, and through medical journals which acted as employment agencies for wet-nurses. In the Southern United States, it was common practice for enslaved Black women to be forced to be <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> to their owner’s children. [...] In some instances, the enslaved child and the owner’s child would be raised together in their younger years. Visual representations of wet-nursing practices in enslaved communities are most prevalent in representations of the Mammy archetype caricature Images such as the one below represent both a historically accurate practice of enslaved Black women wet-nursing their owner’s white children as well as sometimes an exaggerated racist caricaturization of a stereotype of enslaved Black women as “Mammy” characters.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Wet</b> <b>nursing</b> was {{commonplace in}} the British Isles. For years, wet-nursing was a well-paid, respectable and popular job for many lower class women in England. In 17th- and 18th-century Britain, {{a woman would}} earn more money as a <b>wet</b> <b>nurse</b> than her husband could as a labourer. Royal <b>wet</b> <b>nurse</b> held special regard for life. It was common for upper class women to hire <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> to breastfeed their children. The English wet-nurse in Victorian England was most likely a single woman who {{previously}} gave birth to an illegitimate child. There were two types of <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> in Victorian England. There were <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> who were on poor relief and struggled to sufficiently provide for themselves or their charges, {{and then there were}} professional <b>wet</b> <b>nurses</b> who were well paid and respected. Up until the 19th century, most <b>wet</b> <b>nursed</b> infants were sent far from their families to live with their <b>wet</b> <b>nurse</b> for up to {{the first three years of}} their life. As many as 80 percent of wet-nursed babies who lived with their <b>wet</b> <b>nurses,</b> died during infancy, which led to a change living conditions. English women tended to work within their employers homes to take care of her charge, as well as working at hospitals that took in abandoned children. The wet-nurse's own child would likely be sent out to nurse, normally brought up by the bottle, rather than being breastfed. Valerie Fildes, author of [...] "Breasts, Bottle and Babies: A History of Infant Feeding", argues that [...] "In effect, wealthy parents frequently 'bought' the life of their infant for the life of another." [...] Wet-nursing in England decreased in popularity during the mid-19th century due to the writings of medical journalists concerning the undocumented dangers of wet-nursing. Valerie Fildes argued that [...] "Britain has been lumped together with the rest of Europe in any discussion of the qualities, terms of employment and conditions of the <b>wet</b> <b>nurse,</b> and particularly the abuses of which she was supposedly guilty." [...] According to C.H.F. Routh, a medical journalist writing in the late 1850s in England, argued many evils of wet-nursing, such as wet-nurses were more likely to abandon their own children, there was increased mortality for children under the charge of a wet-nurse, and an increased physical and moral risk to a nursed child. While this argument was not founded in any sort of proof, the emotional arguments of medical researchers, coupled with the protests of critics of the practice slowly increased public knowledge and brought wet-nursing into obscurity, replaced by maternal breastfeeding and bottle-feeding.|$|R
