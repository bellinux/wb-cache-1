25|$|Three {{conditions}} must {{be present}} for oil reservoirs to form: a source rock rich in hydrocarbon material buried deep enough for subterranean heat {{to cook it}} into oil, a porous and permeable reservoir rock for it to accumulate in, and a cap rock (seal) or other mechanism that prevents it from escaping to the surface. Within these reservoirs, fluids will typically organize themselves like a three-layer cake {{with a layer of}} water below the oil layer and a layer of gas above it, although the different layers vary in size between reservoirs. Because most hydrocarbons are less dense than rock or water, they often migrate upward through <b>adjacent</b> <b>rock</b> layers until either reaching the surface or becoming trapped within porous rocks (known as reservoirs) by impermeable rocks above. However, the process is influenced by underground water flows, causing oil to migrate hundreds of kilometres horizontally or even short distances downward before becoming trapped in a reservoir. When hydrocarbons are concentrated in a trap, an oil field forms, from which the liquid can be extracted by drilling and pumping.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} gastric-brooding frog {{lived in}} areas of rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest and riverine gallery open forest. They were a predominately aquatic species closely associated with watercourses and <b>adjacent</b> <b>rock</b> pools and soaks. Streams that the southern gastric-brooding frog were found in were mostly permanent and only ceased to flow during years of very low rainfall. Sites where southern gastric-brooding frogs were found usually consisted of closed forests with emergent eucalypts, however there was sites where open forest and grassy ground cover were the predominate vegetation. There is no record for this species occurring in cleared riparian habitat. Searches during spring and summer showed that the favored diurnal habitat was {{at the edge of}} rock pools, either amongst leaf litter, under or between stones or in rock crevices. They were also found under rocks in shallow water. Winter surveys of sites where southern gastric-brooding frogs were common only recovered two specimens, and it is assumed that they hibernated during the colder months. Adult males preferred deeper pools than the juveniles and females which tended to inhabit shallower, newly created (after rain) pools that contained stones and/or leaf litter. Individuals only left themselves fully exposed while sitting on rocks during light rain.|$|E

500|$|Body fossils {{and trace}} fossils are the {{principal}} types of evidence about ancient life, and geochemical evidence has helped to decipher the evolution of life before there were organisms large enough to leave body fossils. Estimating the dates of these remains is essential but difficult: sometimes <b>adjacent</b> <b>rock</b> layers allow radiometric dating, which provides absolute dates that are accurate to within 0.5%, but more often paleontologists {{have to rely on}} relative dating by solving the [...] "jigsaw puzzles" [...] of biostratigraphy. Classifying ancient organisms is also difficult, as many do not fit well into the Linnaean taxonomy that is commonly used for classifying living organisms, and paleontologists more often use cladistics to draw up evolutionary [...] "family trees". The final quarter of the 20th century saw the development of molecular phylogenetics, which investigates how closely organisms are related by measuring how similar the DNA is in their genomes. Molecular phylogenetics has also been used to estimate the dates when species diverged, but there is controversy about the reliability of the molecular clock on which such estimates depend.|$|E
60|$|Ishmael chose a spring, {{that broke}} out of {{the base of a}} rock some forty or fifty feet in elevation, as a place well suited to the wants of his herds. The water {{moistened}} a small swale that lay beneath the spot, which yielded, in return for the fecund gift, a scanty growth of grass. A solitary willow had taken root in the alluvion, and profiting by its exclusive possession of the soil, the tree had sent up its stem far above the crest of the <b>adjacent</b> <b>rock,</b> whose peaked summit had once been shadowed by its branches. But its loveliness had gone with the mysterious principle of life. As if in mockery of the meagre show of verdure that the spot exhibited, it remained a noble and solemn monument of former fertility. The larger, ragged, and fantastic branches still obtruded themselves abroad, while the white and hoary trunk stood naked and tempest-riven. Not a leaf, nor a sign of vegetation, was to be seen about it. In all things it proclaimed the frailty of existence, and the fulfilment of time.|$|E
60|$|It was {{necessary}} he should see Mortsheugh, the sexton {{of the old}} burial-ground at Armitage, to arrange matters for the funeral of Alice; and, as the man dwelt near the place of her late residence, the Master, after a slight refreshment, walked towards {{the place where the}} body of Alice was to be deposited. It was situated in the nook formed by the eddying sweep of a stream, which issued from the adjoining hills. A rude cavern in an <b>adjacent</b> <b>rock,</b> which, in the interior, was cut into the shape of a cross, formed the hermitage, where some Saxon saint had in ancient times done penance, and given name to the place. The rich Abbey of Coldinghame had, in latter days, established a chapel in the neighbourhood, of which no vestige was now visible, though the churchyard which surrounded it was still, as upon the present occasion, used for the interment of particular persons. One or two shattered yew-trees still grew within the precincts of that which had once been holy ground. Warriors and barons had been buried there of old, but their names were forgotten, and their monuments demolished. The only sepulchral memorials which remained were the upright headstones which mark the graves of persons of inferior rank. The abode of the sexton was a solitary cottage adjacent to the ruined wall of the cemetery, but so low that, with its thatch, which nearly reached the ground, covered with a thick crop of grass, fog, and house-leeks, it resembled an overgrown grave. On inquiry, however, Ravenswood found that the man of the last mattock was absent at a bridal, being fiddler as well as grave-digger to the vicinity. He therefore retired to the little inn, leaving a message that early next morning he would again call for the person whose double occupation connected him at once with the house of mourning and the house of feasting.|$|E

50|$|On August 12, 2004, Jack Souther {{convinced}} that Flute Summit is an exposed subvolcanic intrusion {{of an ancient}} volcano. The subvolcanic magma heated and set up convention in nearby groundwater, creating a hydrothermal system. This ancient hydrothermal system, combined with sulfurous gasses released from the magma, caused chemical alteration of both the crystallizing subvolcanic intrusion and the <b>adjacent</b> <b>rocks.</b> The weathering of pyrite crystals inside the subvolcanic rock to iron oxide {{has resulted in the}} redness of Flute Summit.|$|R
40|$|Evidence for shear heating {{associated}} with crustal faulting is described {{for a number}} of fault zones {{in a wide variety of}} tectonic environments. It is shown that a thermal anomaly {{associated with}} the fault has resulted in the metamorphism of <b>adjacent</b> <b>rocks</b> to higher grades than can be accounted for by considering other heat sources.

5000|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{overpressure}} is the rapid loading of fine-grained sediments preventing water from escaping fast enough to equalise the pressure of the overburden. [...] If burial stops or slows, then excess pressure can equalize at a rate that is dependent on the permeability of the overlying and <b>adjacent</b> <b>rocks.</b> A secondary cause of overpressure is fluid expansion, due to changes in the volume of solid and/or fluid phases. Some examples include: aquathermal pressuring (thermal expansion), clay dehydration reactions (such as anhydrite) and mineral transformation (such as kerogen to oil/gas and excess kerogen).|$|R

50|$|Glaciated {{terrain is}} not the only site of hanging streams and valleys. Hanging valleys are also simply the product of varying rates of erosion of the main valley and the {{tributary}} valleys. The varying rates of erosion are associated with the composition of the <b>adjacent</b> <b>rocks</b> in the different valley locations. The tributary valleys are eroded and deepened by glaciers or erosion at a slower rate than that of the main valley floor, thus the difference in the two valleys' depth increases over time. The tributary valley composed of more resistant rock then hangs over the main valley.|$|R
