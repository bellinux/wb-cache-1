2500|$|On one {{occasion}} Humph {{announced that they}} had a very distinguished actor as a guest who would join in the game of Mornington Crescent. When the game started, after great ceremony, the penultimate player, the last of the panellists, won on his first move, thus denying the distinguished guest the opportunity to make a single move. The chairman apologised but explained that this was an unavoidable possibility and the guest left without having uttered a word. The show was allegedly inundated with complaints at the treatment of Sir Alec Guinness as on the actual recording Lyttelton can be heard to say, [...] "Well I'm very sorry about that. Rather unfortunate. We would like to go on and ask you <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> what you're doing currently, Sir Alec, but we do have to hurry on to the next game."

2500|$|Lucca {{decided on}} the Teatro Grande (now the Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi) in Trieste as the {{location}} for the Spring 1848 premiere, but political events in Lombardy postponed it until the autumn. The opera house management felt that Muzio would be capable to handling the staging, but having fled to Switzerland, he became unavailable and the task was handled by Luigi Ricci who, along with his brother Federico, were minor composers of the day. [...] Verdi {{did not attend the}} first performance. However, Verdi's biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz feels that Lucca chose a good house and a cast [...] "almost as good as anyone could have mustered in Europe at the time." [...] In addition, she quotes from a long letter which Verdi wrote to the soprano Marianna Barbieri-Nini, who had been his Lady Macbeth at the 1847 premiere of that opera. In the letter, Verdi said that he wanted [...] "to tell you <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> your pieces", and gives her some very explicit advice on how to sing Gulnara.|$|E

5000|$|Another subgenre is feminist utopias and the {{overlapping}} category of feminist science fiction. Writer Sally Miller Gearhart calls {{this sort of}} fiction political: it contrasts the present world with an idealized society, criticizes contemporary values and conditions, sees men or masculine systems as the major cause {{of social and political}} problems (e.g. war), and presents women as equal to men, having ownership over their reproductive functions. A common solution to gender oppression or social ills in feminist utopian fiction is to remove men, either showing isolated all-female societies as in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Herland, or societies where men have died out or been replaced, as in Joanna Russ's <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Things</b> I Know <b>About</b> Whileaway, where [...] "the poisonous binary gender" [...] has died off. Marge Piercy's novel Woman on the Edge of Time keeps human biology, but removes pregnancy and childbirth from the gender equation by resorting to artificial wombs, while allowing both women and men the nurturing experience of breastfeeding.|$|R

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> appear clear <b>about</b> {{financial}} aid at USF from these analyses: • Loans make up {{by far the}} greatest portion of aid dollars. • Federal Dollars, which support the major portion of USF’s need-based programs are making up a smaller portion of our total {{financial aid}} expenditures {{as time goes on}} (from 74 % in 1986 / 87 to 70 % in 1992 / 93). • Private Dollars, which support primarily merit-based aid are making up a larger portion of our total financial aid dollars over time (The preceding two points reflect national trends.). • USF appears slightly below average relative to our peers regarding the proportion of undergraduates who receive financial aid. • USF, UCF and San Diego State show a high ratio of aid expended to tuition and fees received. This shows that USF's aid dollars combined with our comparatively low tuition and fees help students offset a considerable portion of the cost of their higher education. • No differences in either graduation or retention rates occurred between students receiving financial aid (either need-based or merit-based) and students not receiving aid (matched for sex, race and high school GPA) ...|$|R
60|$|But if {{you must}} be in the struggle, the more reason you should know why, before it begins, and have a say in the {{decision}} whether it is to begin. The youth who went to the war had no such knowledge, no such say; I am sure the survivors, of whom there must be a number here to-day, want you to be wiser than they were, and are certainly determined to be wiser next time themselves. If you are to get that partnership, which, once gained, is to be for mutual benefit, it will be, I should say, by banding yourselves with these men, not defiantly but firmly, not for selfish ends but for your country's good. In the meantime they have one bulwark; they have a General who is befriending them as I think never, after the fighting was over, has a General befriended his men before. Perhaps the seemly thing would be for us, their betters, to elect one of these young survivors of the carnage to be our Rector. He ought now to know <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> war that are worth our hearing. If his theme were the Rector's favourite, diligence. I should be afraid of his advising a great many of us to be diligent in sitting still and doing no more harm.|$|E
60|$|But in our {{particular}} case {{there was another}} perturbing factor. The sun, in its annual march north through the heavens, was increasing its declination. On the 19th parallel of north latitude {{in the middle of}} May the sun is nearly overhead. The angle of arc was between eighty-eight and eighty-nine degrees. Had it been ninety degrees it would have been straight overhead. It was on another day that we learned <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> taking the altitude of the almost perpendicular sun. Roscoe started in drawing the sun down to the eastern horizon, and he stayed by that point of the compass {{despite the fact that the}} sun would pass the meridian to the south. I, on the other hand, started in to draw the sun down to south-east and strayed away to the south-west. You see, we were teaching ourselves. As a result, at twenty-five minutes past twelve by the ship's time, I called twelve o'clock by the sun. Now this signified that we had changed our location on the face of the world by twenty- five minutes, which was equal to something like six degrees of longitude, or three hundred and fifty miles. This showed the Snark had travelled fifteen knots per hour for twenty-four consecutive hours--and we had never noticed it! It was absurd and grotesque. But Roscoe, still looking east, averred that it was not yet twelve o'clock. He was bent on giving us a twenty-knot clip. Then we began to train our sextants rather wildly all around the horizon, and wherever we looked, there was the sun, puzzlingly close to the sky-line, sometimes above it and sometimes below it. In one direction the sun was proclaiming morning, in another direction it was proclaiming afternoon. The sun was all right--we knew that; therefore we were all wrong. And the rest of the afternoon we spent in the cockpit reading up the matter in the books and finding out what was wrong. We missed the observation that day, but we didn't the next. We had learned.|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> {{are certain}} <b>about</b> the U. S. Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{decisions}} this {{term in the}} area of civil rights. It is obvious, for example, that the court is split in a sharp 5 - 4 divide that highlights the absence of retired Justice Sandra Day O 2 ̆ 7 Connor. It is also clear that a powerful new conservative majority has emerged, led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and solidified by Justice Samuel Alito Jr. And, finally, it is apparent that this new majority succeeded in significantly shifting the law in a number of important cases involving the freedom of speech, separation of church and state, equal protection and privacy. What is less certain from these opinions, however, is the true extent of their reach. Court watchers, and even the justices themselves, are debating whether this term 2 ̆ 7 s decisions were exercises in judicial modesty or a sweeping overhaul of important precedents. In other words, did the justices simply interpret the laws narrowly, thereby bringing about only incremental changes? Or are the effects of these rulings more seismic? Did the new majority manage to effectively, yet stealthily, undermine or nullify numerous historic decisions...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} the animality of man {{is back on the}} {{philosophical}} and sociological agenda. At the philosophical level, this results from the more thorough-going critique of anthropocentrism and humanism in contemporary thought. At the sociological level, the re-emergence of the thematic of barbarism, on the one hand, and the emergence of the recognition of our 'posthuman future', on the other hand, has brought into question the centrality of the humanity of the human. I would like to consider four different but inter-related questions that circle around the issues of the subject, sexual difference and the difference between what has been called historically 'man' and animal before concluding with what could be called 'the comatose woman'. I will say <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> first <b>about</b> the emergence of the 'non-concept' of difference in contemporary thought and how it has been used to deconstruct the purported domination of the subject and the technological preformation of thought that flows from it. My argument will be that this reading of philosophy, as Derrida points out, brings to the fore the question of what the German language calls Geschlecht; that is, the question or questions of species difference, of sexual difference, of ethnic or racial difference. In sum, those differences that the subject of western metaphysics transcended, either non-dialectically or dialectically. These differences have been described conventionally as belonging to the order of nature, which is a categorization that deconstruction rejects. What might lie beyond nature and these 'naturalised' differences is a certain experience of an originary multiplicity of the world before its determination by subjectifying thought. The question that the issue of sexual and species difference raises, however, is: How can we both deconstruct the subject and the spiritualist metaphysics that determine it, while not falling into a naturalism or biologism that still requires both critique and denunciation? Is there not only a paradox, but a dangerous paradox in trying to think the multiple. It is my argument that deconstruction can not really answer these question and that this fact necessitates a re-evaluation of the subject and points to the limitations of postmodern notions of difference...|$|R
50|$|Carlo Caremoli (Trintignant) {{arrives in}} Riccione, and enjoys life {{together}} with his friends at his father's villa. Riccione is still peaceful, and only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> remind <b>about</b> the war fought in the south. On seaside holiday, the youth witness a German fighter flying low over the beach and causing panic among the crowd. Carlo tries to protect a frightened little girl who runs toward him, and meets her mother, Roberta (Rossi Drago), a naval officer's widow. Carlo is attracted to Roberta, often meets her and even makes a trip with her to San Marino, although Roberta's mother (Lilla Brignone) disapproves of this new acquaintance, and urges her {{to stay away from}} Carlo, partly because of his father, Ettore Caremoli (Enrico Maria Salerno), a brutal Fascist. Meanwhile, Maddalena (Federica Ranchi), the young sister of Roberta's deceased husband, arrives from Catanzaro, fleeing the impending war. Maddalena spends time with Carlo's friends, and together with Roberta, is invited to a circus. However, the show is interrupted by an air raid blackout, and the friends proceed to a nighttime party at Carlo's villa. After watching flares in the night sky, the men and women form couples and start dancing to a record of Temptation, Carlo with his girlfriend Rosanna (Jacqueline Sassard), and Roberta with a much younger boy. The camera cuts between Carlo and Roberta, staring at each other passionately. Carlo asks Roberta for the next dance, and the couple end up kissing in the garden, which deeply hurts Rosanna. The next day, Roberta initially refuses to admit her true feelings to Carlo, but ultimately accedes. Meanwhile, on July 25, the news of Mussolini's ouster is announced. Carlo and Roberta continue to go on dates. However, Carlo's father is forced to flee, and his villa is confiscated. Carlo meets Roberta once again and spends a night with her, provoking discontent from her mother, and Maddalena decides to leave. During a curfew, a patrol discovers the couple on the beach and finds out that Carlo's military exemption has expired. As his father has fled, he has no chance to renew it anymore. Roberta proposes that he hide at her villa in Rovigo, and the next morning they take a train. However, during the trip the tracks are bombed by the Allies, and the couple barely escape death. After the air raid, Roberta gets back on the train, but Carlo refuses to join her until the war is over, and they part as the train leaves.|$|R
