5000|$|The Turkish Air Force had 131 {{first line}} {{aircraft}} in 1937, of which only half were relatively modern. Turkey hoped {{to increase the}} size of its fleet to 300 by 1938. Although Turkey had 300 trained pilots, they would be only rated moderate with little ability to fly in bad weather in a Western European Air Force. In 1942, Ernest Phillips in his work Hitler's last Hope: A factual survey of the Middle East warzone and Turkey's vital strategic position admitted: [...] "If the Germans were to stage an all out offensive in this area, they could bring more planes into the air than the Turks could even gather, and if we were to send too many from Libya to help Turkey, the weakness there would be such that we should be in difficulties {{on the other side of}} the Suez." [...] At the beginning of World War II the Turkish Air Force consisted of some 370 aircraft of all types, 450 pilots and 8,000 men. During the war Turkey sent pilots to Great Britain for training purposes. 14 are known to have died in Great Britain. One of them was shot down by a German plane during a training flight in British air space, the rest died in accidents. The daughter of former Air Forces Commander Emin Alpkaya, who had been sent to Britain for training during the war, stated she found something amazing while examining her father's wartime diaries. He wrote that [...] "they have told me that I am ready to go to Berlin. I have returned from the bombardment at 6 in the morning. I was tired". There were some allegations that Turkish pilots, who had been in Britain to get training during World War II, joined missions which bombed Berlin. However officials of the Turkish General Staff asserted that their pilots were never assigned in <b>active</b> <b>aerial</b> warfare and bombing flights. Alpkaya may have been referring to a ride along in a plane manned by an allied crew, in which he took on the role of observer, and not a combat role.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{planning}} a path for a ground robot through unknown terrain, using observations from a flying robot. In search and rescue missions, which are our target scenarios, the time from arrival at the disaster site to the delivery of aid is critically important. Previous works required exhaustive exploration before path planning, which is time-consuming but eventually leads to an optimal path for the ground robot. Instead, we propose active exploration of the environment, where the flying robot chooses regions to map in a way that optimizes the overall response time of the system, which is the combined time for the air and ground robots to execute their missions. In our approach, we estimate terrain classes throughout our terrain map, and we also add elevation information in areas where the active exploration algorithm has chosen to perform 3 -D reconstruction. This terrain information is used to estimate feasible and efficient paths for the ground robot. By exploring the environment actively, we achieve superior response times compared to both exhaustive and greedy exploration strategies. We demonstrate the performance and capabilities of the proposed system in simulated and real-world outdoor experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address ground robot path planning using <b>active</b> <b>aerial</b> exploration...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{interact}} with its visual environment, an organism needs to perceive objects in both space and time. High temporal resolution is hence {{important to the}} fitness of diurnally active animals, not least highly <b>active</b> <b>aerial</b> species such as birds. However, temporal resolution, as assessed by flicker fusion frequency (FFF; the stimulus frequency at which a flickering light stimulus {{can no longer be}} resolved and appears continuous) or critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF; the highest flicker fusion frequency at any light intensity) has rarely been assessed in birds. In order to further our understanding of temporal resolution as a function of light intensity in birds we used behavioural experiments with domestic chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) from an old game breed ‘Gammalsvensk dvärghöna’ (which is morphologically and behaviourally similar to the wildtype ancestor, the red jungle fowl, G. gallus), to generate an ‘Intensity/FFF curve’ (I/FFF curve) across full spectrum light intensities ranging from 0. 2 to 2812 cdm− 2. The I/FFF curve is double-branched, resembling that of other chordates with a duplex retina of both rods and cones. Assuming that the branches represent rod and cone mediated responses respectively, the break point between them places the transition between scotopic and photopic vision at between 0. 8 and 1. 9 cdm− 2. Average FFF ranged from 19. 8 Hz at the lowest light intensity to a CFF 87. 0 Hz at 1375 cdm− 2. FFF dropped slightly at the highest light intensity. There was some individual variation with certain birds displaying CFFs of 90 – 100 Hz. The FFF values demonstrated by this non-selected breed appear to be considerably higher than other behaviourally derived FFF values for similar stimuli reported for white and brown commercial laying hens, indicating that the domestication process might have influenced temporal resolution in chicken...|$|E

This review sought to synthesize existing research on genetic estimation of population connectivity in desert freshwaters, identify knowledge gaps, and set priorities for future studies of connectivity in these environments. From an extensive literature search, we synthesized the approaches applied, systems studied, and conclusions about connectivity reached in population genetic research concerning desert freshwater connectivity globally. We restrict our scope to obligate aquatic fauna that disperse largely via freshwaters and exclude those with <b>active</b> <b>aerial</b> dispersal abilities. We examined 92 papers, comprising 133 studies, published from 1987 to 2014. Most described studies of fishes and invertebrates in the deserts of Australia and North America. Connectivity declined with increasing scale, but did not differ significantly among arid regions or taxonomic classes. There were significant differences in connectivity patterns between species with different dispersal abilities, and between spring and riverine habitats at local scales. Population connectivity in desert freshwaters is typically most influenced by the ecology of the species concerned and hydrological connectivity. Most studies did not assess predefined models of connectivity, but described gene flow and/or genetic structure. Climate change and anthropogenic impacts worldwide are likely to increase the incidence and impact of habitat fragmentation in already threatened desert freshwaters. To reduce this risk, biodiversity conservation and environmental management must address connectivity, but often the required information does not exist. Researchers can provide this by explicitly considering the effects of hydrology and species’ ecology on connectivity, and incorporating these into connectivity models, which are vital for understanding connectivity in desert freshwaters...|$|E
40|$|Micro Aerial Vehicles and {{especially}} multi rotors are gaining {{more and more}} attention for accomplishing complex tasks, considering their simple mechanical design and their versatile movement. MAVs are ideal candidates to perform tasks autonomously, to work safely in close proximity and in collaboration with humans, and to operate safely and effectively in natural human environments, like infrastructure inspection-maintenance, underground mine operations and surveillance missions. Adopting this vision, this thesis contributes in the aerial platform ecosystem that can be summarized by the term Aerial Robotic Worker (ARW). An ARW is characterized, among others, by its advanced capabilities on environmental perception and 3 D reconstruction and <b>active</b> <b>aerial</b> manipulation. Using cameras for localization, mapping of an ARW as well as guidance on aerial manipulation is appealing {{mainly because of the}} small size and cost of such sensors. Nevertheless, visualinformation provided from the cameras is enormous, posing significant challenges in real-time data processing, while meeting the constraints of these platforms. Additionally, another challenge on visual perception considers the usage of multiple agents that collaboratively perceive their surroundings forming an aerial sensor. This thesis also investigates the applicability of visual SLAM algorithms in uncontrolled and cluttered environments. Furthermore, work will be presented on visual guidance for an aerial manipulator, which is challenging regarding the object detection, tracking and the platform approaching strategies. The first contribution will be the establishment of a flexible virtual stereo rig consisted of MPC controlled MAVs. The advantage of this approach is the varying baseline sensor that is composed from independently moving cameras, adjusting the depth perception accordingly. This method is able to provide the 3 D reconstruction of the environment in a sparse pointcloud. The second contribution of this this thesis will examine the single agents in two different scenarios. Initially, experimental trials of commonly used visual sensors in hard and challenging environments will be presented in real scale underground ore mine to evaluate the localization and mapping performance of such technology for potential usage in UAVs. Secondly, theoretical work will be performed regarding attitude regulation of a hexacopter for stable hovering based on visual localization. In this work the time delays induced from the processing should be compensated with a switching control scheme which is able to maintain the stability of the platform. Finally, a third contribution of this thesis will be vision for aerial manipulation. The developed system includes a stereo camera that is attached on the end-effector of the aerial manipulator and is used to provide robust target detection and tracking. The visual feedback is processed to co-localize the aerial agent with the target and generate a waypoint that allows to approach the target...|$|E

40|$|The gram-positive {{filamentous}} bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor has {{a complex}} developmental cycle with three distinct phases: {{growth of the}} substrate mycelium, development of reproductive structures called aerial hyphae, and differentiation of these aerial filaments into long chains of exospores. During a transposon mutagenesis screen, we identified a novel gene (devA) required for proper development. The devA mutant produced only rare aerial hyphae, and those that were produced developed aberrant spore chains that were much shorter than wild-type chains and had misplaced septa. devA encodes {{a member of the}} GntR superfamily, a class of transcriptional regulators that typically respond to metabolite effector molecules. devA forms an operon with the downstream gene devB, which encodes a putative hydrolase that is also required for aerial mycelium formation on R 5 medium. S 1 nuclease protection analysis showed that transcription from the single devA promoter was temporally associated with vegetative growth, and enhanced green fluorescent protein transcriptional fusions showed that transcription was spatially confined to the substrate hyphae in the wild type. In contrast, devAB transcript levels were dramatically upregulated in a devA mutant and the devA promoter was also <b>active</b> in <b>aerial</b> hyphae and spores in this background, suggesting that DevA might negatively regulate its own production. This suggestion was confirmed by gel mobility shift assays that showed that DevA binds its own promoter region in vitro. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|To better {{understand}} how Ras controls development of multicellular organisms, we have chosen Aspergillus nidulans as a model system. When grown on solid medium, this fungus follows a well-defined program of development, sequentially giving rise to several cell types which produce three distinct structures: vegetative hyphae, aerial hyphae, and the conidiophore structure. Here we describe a ras homolog found in this fungus (Aras) and demonstrate {{that it is an}} essential gene that regulates the ordered program of development. We created dominant alleles of this gene and expressed them to different levels in order to vary the ratio of GTP-bound (active) to GDP-bound (inactive) A-Ras protein. When the amount of active Ras is large, nuclear division proceeds, but further development is inhibited at the early step of germ tube formation. At an intermediate level of <b>active</b> Ras, <b>aerial</b> hypha formation is inhibited, while at a low level, conidiophore formation is inhibited. Maintenance of an even lower level of the active Ras is essential for initiation and progression of conidiophore formation, the final stage of development. When the level of active Ras is artificially lowered, each stage of development is initiated prematurely except germination, the initial stage of development. Therefore, the progression of the ordered developmental pathway of A. nidulans is dependent upon an initial high level of active Ras followed by its gradual decrease. We propose that several concentration threshold exist, each of which allows development to proceed to a certain point, producing the proper cell type while inhibiting further development...|$|R

The results show that the promoter is active before the septation event that separates the sub-apical compartment from the tip compartment destined to become a spore chain. We conclude that WhiG-directed RNA polymerase activity, which {{is required}} for whiH transcription, must precede this septation event and is not restricted to apical sporogenic compartment of the aerial hyphae. Further, it is demonstrated that WhiH, a predicted member of the GntR family of transcription factors, is able to bind specifically to a sequence in its own promoter, strongly suggesting that it acts as an autoregulatory transcription factor.

40|$|World Health Organization (WHO) {{has defined}} herbal {{medicines}} as finished labeled medicinal product that contain an <b>active</b> ingredient, <b>aerial,</b> or underground {{parts of the}} plant or other plant material or combinations. According to a report of WHO, about 80 % of the world population is reported to rely on traditional medicine for their primary health care needs. Even in the developed countries, complementary or alternative medicine is gaining popularity. A report of a global survey on national policy on traditional medicine and regulation of herbal medicines indicated that about 50 countries including China, Japan, and Germany already have their national policy and laws on regulations of traditional medicines. Herbal drugs possess {{a long history of}} its use and better patient tolerance. These are cheaper and easily available in countries like India due to rich agro culture conditions. However, reckless utilization of resources threatens the sustainability of several plant species. Traditional medicines are governed by the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940 and the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules of 1945. In 1959, the Government of India amended the Drugs and Cosmetics Act to include drugs that are derived from traditional Indian medicine. In 1993, the guidelines for the safety and efficacy of herbal medicines developed by an expert committee directed that the procedures laid down by the office of the Drug Controller General of India for allopathic drugs should be followed for all traditional and herbal products to enter into clinical trials for any therapeutic condition. However, there are certain loop holes in the clinical trials of herbal drugs as the lack of stringent bylaws and regulations. Hence, a deep insight of important challenges and major regulatory guidelines for clinical trial of herbal drugs and botanicals is discussed in the present communication. There is lack of scientific evidence to evaluate safety and efficacy of herbal drugs. The quality of the trial drug has to be tested for batch-to-batch uniformity of the active constituents. It is very difficult to have active and control groups with identical color, smell and taste of the herbal drug, which cannot be imitated while manufacturing a placebo. These challenges can be reduced or overcome by applying most recent methodologies and guidelines for clinical trials. Since the quality control of herbal medicines is complicated and difficult, relevant and appropriate requirements should be established for the assessment of safety and efficacy for different categorized herbal medicines to reduce cost and expenditure. And, efforts should be made for the integration of traditional medicine into national healthcare systems. Different challenges and regulatory guidelines discussed for the clinical trial of herbal drugs will be useful for various industries for considering it before going ahead for clinical trial of their product...|$|R
40|$|Recentemente, o Cerrado foi incluído na lista das áreas críticas para a conservação no mundo. Ocupando 21 % do território nacional, estima-se que 800 espécies de plantas vasculares, entre árvores e arbustos, sejam endêmicas deste bioma. O estudo das plantas {{medicina}}is nativas do Cerrado e respectivos aleloquímicos pode representar significativo potencial para a busca de produtos naturais. Os flavonoides compreendem um dos principais grupos de substâncias antioxidantes de origem vegetal. Assim, as propriedades antioxidantes dos flavonoides têm atraído a atenção para a prevenção de doenças crônico-degenerativas e outras patologias. Bauhinia L. (Fabaceae) compreende aproximadamente 300 espécies, sendo Bauhinia holophylla (Bong.) Steud. um arbusto típico do cerrado, muito utilizado na medicina popular; porém, não há estudos sobre a constituição química e atividade farmacológica desta espécie. Os objetivos deste trabalho foram realizar estudo fitoquímico a partir de folhas secas de Bauhinia holophylla e ensaios químicos biológicos com extratos e frações ativas. Para tanto, foram realizadas coleta de folhas, obtenção de extrato hidroalcoólico, extração líquido-líquido (LLE) entre diferentes solventes orgânicos e água para obtenção de frações enriquecidas, fracionamento através de diferentes técnicas cromatográficas (GPC, HPLC-RI, CC) e identificação das substâncias isoladas (HPLC-ESI-IT-MS, FIA-EIS-IT-MS/MSn, RMN). A atividade antioxidante do extrato e das frações enriquecidas foi avaliada utilizando o método de sequestro de radicais pelo DPPH. O perfil cromatográfico (fingerprint) do extrato hidroalcólico de B. holophylla foi avaliado por HPLC-UV-PDA e o potencial alelopático através da germinação de sementes e crescimento inicial de raiz de Cucumis sativus L. e Hordeum vulgare L. embebidas em diferentes concentrações do extrato hidroalcoólico [...] . Recently, the Cerrado {{has been}} included in the list of critical areas for conservation in the world. Occupying 21 % of the brazilian territory, it is estimated that 800 species of vascular plants, including trees and shrubs, are endemic to this biome. The study of medicinal plants in the Cerrado and their allelochemicals is important in the search for natural products. The flavonoids comprise a major group of natural antioxidant substances. Thus, the antioxidant properties of flavonoids have attracted attention to the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases and other pathologies. Bauhinia L. (Fabaceae) comprises about 300 species, Bauhinia holophylla (Bong.) Steud. is a typical bush from savannah, widely used in folk medicine, but there are no studies on the chemical composition and pharmacological activity of this species. The objectives of this study were the phytochemical study from dried leaves of Bauhinia holophylla, biological and chemical assays with extracts and <b>active</b> fractions. The <b>aerial</b> parts were collected, dried and powdered, obtaining hydroalcoholic extract. Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) between different organic solvents and water obtained enriched fractions. The fractionation was performed using different chromatographic techniques (GPC, HPLC-RI, CC) and the identification of substances isolated was performed using HPLC-ESI-IT-MS, FIA-EIS-IT-MS/MSn, NMR. The antioxidant activity of the extract and fractions was performed using the method of sequestration by DPPH radicals. The chromatographic profile (fingerprint) of the hydroalcoholic extract of B. holophylla was evaluated by HPLC-UV-PDA and allelopathic potential through seed germination and initial root growth of Cucumis sativus L. and Hordeum vulgare L. soaked in different concentrations of hydroalcoholic extract (10 mg. L- 1, 20 mg. L- 1, 40 mg. L- 1, 80 mg. L- 1, 160 mg. L- 1 and 320 mg. L- 1). The results showed that the hydroalcoholic [...] ...|$|R
