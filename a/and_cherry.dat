5|$|The Union Springs is an organic-rich, pyritiferous, thinly bedded, blackish gray {{to black}} shale with {{mudstone}} concretionary layers, and thin silt bands at the bottom.

To the west the Union Springs beds thin, with its upper limestones merging with the overlying calcareous Cherry Valley Member.

5|$|Blue Streak {{service on}} Route 41 began on September 8, 1970, {{traveling}} on local streets between Sand Point, Lake City and Northgate Mall, and proceeding onto Interstate 5 non-stop to Downtown Seattle. Blue Streak buses were given exclusive {{use of the}} Columbia <b>and</b> <b>Cherry</b> ramps on the Interstate 5 reversible express lanes, {{as well as a}} bus-only lane on 5th Avenue. Buses traveled primarily on 3rd Avenue through Downtown, heading northbound during morning inbound trips and southbound during afternoon outbound trips towards Northgate. Buses ran at a frequency of 7 to 15 minutes from 7a.m. to 7p.m. on weekdays and Saturdays. The trip between Northgate and downtown took an average of 15 minutes, and took near-full busloads on the first day. The 22 buses on Blue Streak service were initially colored red, but were later repainted blue to match the branding.|$|E
5|$|CG {{was also}} used to {{recreate}} the San Francisco neighborhood at Washington <b>and</b> <b>Cherry</b> Streets where cab driver Paul Stine was killed. The area had changed significantly {{over the years and}} residents didn't want the murder to be re-created in their neighborhood, so Fincher shot the six-minute sequence on a bluescreen stage. Production designer Donald Burt gave the visual effects team detailed drawings of the intersection as it was in 1969. Photographs of every possible angle of the area were shot with a high-resolution digital camera, allowing the effects crew to build computer-based geometric models of homes that were then textured with period facades. 3-D vintage police motorcycles, squad cars, a firetruck and street lights were added to the final shot.|$|E
5|$|On the May 23 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Deuce 'n Domino parted ways with Cherry and {{replaced}} her with Maryse.

Deuce then threw his jacket over Domino, dissolving their partnership. The split was then further cemented when Deuce was drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2008 WWE Supplemental Draft. Following the draft, Domino was predominantly featured as an enhancement talent—a wrestler who consistently loses to make his opponents look stronger—on SmackDown weekly. In August 2008, Domino <b>and</b> <b>Cherry</b> were released from their WWE contracts. The following year, Deuce was released from the WWE as well.|$|E

5|$|A lack of {{stability}} continually plagued the team. The franchise never {{won more than}} 22 games and {{did not return to}} the playoffs after 1977–78 in its six seasons in Colorado. Prior to the 1978–79 season, the team was sold to New Jersey trucking tycoon Arthur Imperatore, who intended to move the team to his home state. The plan was criticized due to the existence of three other NHL teams in the region, and the proposed New Jersey arena was still under construction; the franchise ultimately stayed in Denver. In 1979, the team hired Don Cherry as head coach and featured forward Lanny McDonald. The Rockies still posted the worst record in the NHL, <b>and</b> <b>Cherry</b> was subsequently fired after the season. After two more years in Denver, the Rockies were sold to a group headed by John McMullen (who also owned Major League Baseball's Houston Astros) on May 27, 1982, and the franchise moved to New Jersey. As part of the relocation deal, the Devils had to compensate the three existing teams in the region – the New York Islanders, New York Rangers and Flyers – for encroaching on their territory.|$|E
5|$|Effects from Helene in South Carolina {{were less}} severe than in North Carolina. Helene made its closest {{approach}} to the state on September27, 85mi (135km). In Charleston, sustained winds reached 63mph (101km/h) and there was minor damage reported Trees and street signs were blown down, and beach houses suffered shingle damage. Sporadic and small power outages occurred throughout the city. Damage became progressively worse from Georgetown to Little River, with automobile accidents, torn roofs, and damaged piers. On Harbor Island, 50percent of structure {{were reported to have}} roof damage, causing and estimated $125,000in damages. Elsewhere along the South Carolina coast, beach erosion occurred due to the strong waves, and sections of pier were swept into sea. In Windy Hill <b>and</b> <b>Cherry</b> Grove Beach, three fishing piers were damaged. Damage was minor in Myrtle Beach, and was limited to roof and window damage. Further inland, in Columbia, damage was minimal, with no rainfall reported. Light damage to crops was reported inland, particularly in Marion County. Across the state, damages were estimated at $200,000from the hurricane, though this did not include beach erosion or damage to sand dunes.|$|E

5|$|Promoted to {{lieutenant}} on 25 August 1916, Cherry {{returned to}} his unit on the Somme in November. The following month he was made a temporary captain and transferred back to the 26th Battalion as the commanding officer of C Company. His rank was confirmed on 14 February 1917, and on 1–2 March {{he was involved in}} the battalion's actions around the village of Warlencourt. At 03:00 on 2 March, Cherry led his company in an attack on the German held position of Malt Trench, situated between the villages of Warlencourt and Bapaume. Artillery fire had failed to adequately cut the barbed wire lines for the advancing troops, <b>and</b> <b>Cherry</b> led a section of men along the wire until he found a break in it. Once through the gap, he rushed two machine gun posts, capturing one single-handed, and turned one on the fleeing Germans before being wounded himself. For his actions during the engagement, Cherry was awarded the Military Cross, the notification of which was published in a supplement of the London Gazette on 26 April 1917.|$|E
5|$|There is also {{an older}} {{downtown}} grid system {{that was designed to}} be parallel to the confluence of the South Platte River <b>and</b> <b>Cherry</b> Creek. Most of the streets downtown and in LoDo run northeast–southwest and northwest–southeast. This system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal; if the streets were in a normal N–S/E–W grid, only the N–S streets would receive sunlight. With the grid oriented to the diagonal directions, the NW–SE streets receive sunlight to melt snow in the morning and the NE–SW streets receive it in the afternoon. This idea was from Henry Brown the founder of the Brown Palace Hotel. There is now a plaque {{across the street from the}} Brown Palace Hotel which honors this idea. The NW–SE streets are numbered, while the NE–SW streets are named. The named streets start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with the block-long Cheyenne Place. The numbered streets start underneath the Colfax and I-25 viaducts. There are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid. There are also a few vestiges of the old grid system in the normal grid, such as Park Avenue, Morrison Road, and Speer Boulevard. Larimer Street, named after William Larimer, Jr., the founder of Denver, which is in the heart of LoDo, is the oldest street in Denver.|$|E
