40|$|We {{consider}} networks with <b>aggregated</b> <b>links,</b> that is {{networks in}} which physical link segments between two interconnected devices are grouped {{into a single}} logical link. Network devices supporting such <b>aggregated</b> <b>links</b> must implement a distribution algorithm responsible for choosing the transmission link for any given packet. Traditionally, {{in order to maintain}} packet ordering within conversations (which is crucial for maintaining high performance of transmission protocols), all distribution algorithms transmitted packets from a given conversation on a single link. This approach is attractive for its simplicity, but in some conditions it tends to under-utilize the capacity of the link. Sending packets from the same conversation simultaneously along different physical links is likely to improve performance, but, with packets of different lengths, one needs to schedule the transmissions carefully to ensure that the packets arrive in the correct order. Recently, Jawor et al. [6] formulated this packet scheduling problem as an online optimization problem and proposed an algorithm called Block. The focus of the work in [6] was purely theoretical – to achieve an optimal competitive ratio. In this paper we study this problem in an experimental setting. To this end, we develop a refined version of Algorithm Block (retaining its competitive ratio), and we show, through experimental analysis, that it indeed significantly reduces the maximum amount of time packets spent in buffers before transmission, compared to the standard methods based on hashing. ...|$|E

40|$|Recently, we {{have seen}} routers' life {{expectancy}} dramatically shortened {{as a result of}} Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and enterprise companies equipment replacement patterns: new, high performance routers are usually introduced in the core of their network, pushing existing routers towards the network edge, with routers already at the edge being often decomissioned before the end of their hardware life cycle. Furthermore, ISPs' customers interconnection demands have become more difficult to meet considering that they might change in time and that ISPs not only need to provide an inteconnection link but also a whole network solution. For solving the previous problems, this thesis focuses to explore alternative ways to utilise routers which can further extend their serviceability life cycle while providing a flexible platform that can facilitate ISPs to meet customers interconnection demands. We investigate new methods that could allow us to decouple routers logical routing and forwarding functionalities from the hardware that implements them. In contrast with the traditional and well-known techniques for achieving the lat- ter, we employ an automatic configuration management approach that modifies dynamically the configurations of a set of routers which can further exploit their usefulness by using them in conjuncture. The previous approach relies on the flexibility that routers offer through their configuration interface, hence including most routers regardless its type and make. Our proposed approach is based on a routers management architecture, namely RoMa, aimed at hosting multiple and various routers through a set of interconnected routers. Such architecture not only considers to host routers using a single but multiple hardware chassis. To demonstrate the feasability of providing the means for building a logical router using multiple hardware routers represents the core of this thesis. For this, we have designed a logical entity called distributed IP router. We focus on two key issues for building this type of logical routers. First, supporting the intra-domain routing function in these logical entities. Second, provisioning such logicial entities with <b>aggregated</b> <b>links.</b> Our findings suggest that such logical routers are feasible and can provide new highly desirable features in comparison with standard routers, as it is the case of the <b>aggregated</b> <b>links.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

We present a deterministic online algorithm Block with competitive ratio O(pn/m), and show a matching lower bound, even for randomized algorithms. The performance bound for Block we derive in the paper is, in fact, more subtle than a simple competitive analysis, and it shows that in overload conditions (when many jobs are released in a short amount of time), Block's performance is close to the optimum. We also show how to compute an offline solution efficiently for k = 1, and that minimizing the maximum flow time for k, m> = 2 is N P-hard. As by-products of our construction, we obtain a 2 -approximation algorithm for minimizing makespan in our model, and an offline algorithm to minimize makespan for k = 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper formulates {{the problem}} of finding the most likely {{distribution}} of origin-destination (O-D) specific link volumes (called "link uses") from equilibrium assignment. Although an equilibrium assignment is unique in terms of <b>aggregate</b> <b>link</b> volumes, trips between different O-D pairs assigned to alternative paths between any node pair can be swapped among these paths such that total link volumes remain unchanged. Alternative link uses that yield identical <b>aggregate</b> <b>link</b> volumes can affect O-D specific estimates of fuel consumption, pollution emissions or development impacts. Equilibrium assignments found by methods of linear combinations, such as the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, may not represent most likely link uses. The problem of finding maximum entropy link uses (MELU) formulated herein is a multi-commodity optimum flow (max-flow at min-cost) problem with nonlinear flow-dependent link use costs. MELU does not require path enumeration or knowledge of used paths between zones, but it is NP-hard to solve and very sizable for large networks. An approximate solution technique is presented that finds likely link uses for realistic size problems. The method is to linearly combine successive F-W solutions using step sizes that seek a maximum entropy mix. The examples include other comparisons of trial link uses that indicate {{the extent to which}} they differ. ...|$|R

This thesis presents statistics of the Internet traffic for Users connected through the public frame relay network. It also presents some observations that may help in improvement of the service to be of a better quality and affordable cost. Measurements and statistics in this research showed that most of the Internet users are concentrated in Khartoum center and Khartoum south areas, and are allocated percentages of the total bandwidth between 43 % for users in Khartoum center area and 37 % for users in Khartoum south area. Statistics of bandwidth distribution per user category showed that 42. 9 % of the bandwidth is allocated to Service providers. Statistics of the daily traffic variations showed that the Overall traffic has its peak hour at 2 pm and drops to its minimum at 6 a. m. it also showed that the mean of traffic intensity is twice its standard deviation and the variance is very high if related to the mean. Per weekday analysis of the traffic showed that the average traffic utilization per weekday for the <b>aggregate</b> <b>links</b> maintains the same level with slight drop on Fridays. From the study of traffic variations per user category it is observed that traffic generated by local service providers has a great impact on the overall traffic pattern.

40|$|Abstract — We propose an {{architecture}} for MPLS restoration routing of DiffServ traffic. This architecture, namely Per Class Aggregate Information With Preemption (CAIP), facilitates provisioning of two key QoS features for multimedia traffic: prioritized guaranteed bandwidth and fast restoration {{in the event}} of an element failure. The CAIP architecture is scalable and requires propagating only per-class <b>aggregate</b> <b>link</b> usage information; such information can be readily piggybacked on link state routing packets using traffic engineering extensions to link state routing protocols [1]. CAIP results in improved bandwidth sharing compared to Simple Aggregate Information Scenario (SAIS), resulting in fewer LSP rejected requests and a greater amount of active bandwidth placed on the network. On average, CAIP rejects 881 LSP requests compared to 1010 rejected LSP requests in SAIS for a typical ISP network. Similarly, CAIP is able to place 220 units of bandwidth compared to 180 units of bandwidth placed in SAIS, thus showing an average improvement of about 22 %. CAIP allows precise computation of preemptable bandwidth for an arbitrary set of prioritization requirements put forth by the service providers. We present a case study of service provider requirements and computation of preemptable bandwidth for those requirements. CAIP can be integrated with those restoration routing schemes that make use of propagating <b>aggregate</b> <b>link</b> usage information. Furthermore, existing preemption schemes can be used with CAIP in order to decide the actual LSPs which need to be preempted...|$|R

However, RSS metric performance degrades in complex environments because of multipath fading and fast temporal dynamics. The use of physical layer (PHY) raw signal features, although not yet fully standardized [10], is believed to provide significant performance improvements.|$|R
