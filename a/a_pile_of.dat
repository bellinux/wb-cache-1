Typically, children between ages nine and eleven demonstrate the cognitive flexibility needed for this test.|$|E
5|$|The Advisory Committee on Uranium {{provided}} {{money for}} Fermi to buy graphite, and he built <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> graphite bricks {{on the seventh}} floor of the Pupin Hall laboratory.

5|$|The {{site of the}} burned-out capitol {{building}} remained <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> stones for several years after the fire.

5|$|The video commences with {{shots of}} a {{construction}} site, where Ciara arrives {{in a large}} construction vehicle. Elliott raps her opening verse {{from the top of}} <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> large tires while Ciara makes her debut in a gray jumpsuit with square aviator sunglasses. She soon appears in a slender black leotard and walks seductively along a construction walkway. Ciara and her dancers move to a dune in front of the site, where they perform a group choreography. The dancers wear white tops, torn blue jeans, construction belts and goggles. The second verse features an intense dance and switches halfway through to Ciara in a turquoise PVC dress and black strap stilettos, dancing in front of <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> tires. She and her dancers return to the dune and dance to Elliott's words. The video ends in the sand dune as Ciara and her dancers slowly drop to the ground and then get back up.|$|E
5|$|A {{southbound}} {{passenger train}} and a pilot engine left Arthington station on 19 September 1854 heading for Leeds. A pilot engine had travelled northbound {{through the tunnel}} earlier the same day with no problems {{but this time the}} train ran into <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> stone debris and was derailed when it was three-quarters of the way into the tunnel. The debris was from a roof fall that affected both tracks. The train engine collided with the pilot engine tender causing considerable damage.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Vlasic played college {{football}} at the University of Iowa. For four years, {{he served as a}} backup to Chuck Long, now a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. During his junior year, as the backup quarterback, he also served as the holder for field goal kicks. After placekicker Rob Houghtlin won a 12-10 game against the University of Michigan thanks to a last second field goal, a mob tore down the goalpost, which injured four fans including Vlasic, who was at the bottom of <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> fans.|$|E

A reporter for The New York Times inspected the children's bodies taken to a nearby American military base and reported seeing burns on some of the legs and heads.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the rocks}} and {{minerals}} are housed in glass cases along the walls in the basement. Before opening to the public an elevator {{was added to the}} home. The museum includes a lapidary and arts gallery, agate gallery, petrified wood gallery, oddities gallery, crystal gallery, Northwest gallery, and fossil gallery. There is also an educational room and gift shop, while the outside grounds include a walk that features sandstone, columns of basalt, and <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> rocks for children to climb over to find stones. This walk includes a 1,200 pound (540kg) rock made of pumice.|$|E

5|$|The Match of 10,000 Tacks was up next, pitting Abyss and Raven against Black Reign and Rellik. Rhino was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} a part of the match, but was removed due to a neck injury he sustained in a previous match; he was replaced with Raven. The encounter lasted fourteen minutes and forty-one seconds. Raven forced Reign through a table covered with thumbtacks during the contest. The team of Abyss and Raven won the bout, after Abyss slammed Rellik into <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> thumbtacks and then gained the pinfall victory. Abyss required stitches as a result of this match.|$|E
5|$|The episode centres on Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) working {{her first}} case with Torchwood Three in Cardiff. A purple alien gas is {{loose in the}} city and takes Carys Fletcher (Sara Gregory) host; the gas kills its victims by orgasm, leaving behind <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> dust. Over the course of the episode, the team hunt for Carys before the gas kills her.

5|$|The fifth {{match of}} the show saw Abyss face Sabu in a No Disqualification match. Abyss was {{accompanied}} by James Mitchell. In a No Disqualification match, weapons are legal, as well as outside interference, with a victor determined only by pinfall or submission. Abyss slammed Sabu into <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> thumbtacks to earn a two-count during the match. Near the end, Sabu tried to hit Abyss with a steal chair wrapped in barbed-wire, but Abyss countered the maneuver. This led to Abyss slamming Sabu back-first onto the barbed-wire wrapped steal chair with his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver to win the encounter at 10 minutes and 48 seconds.|$|E

5|$|There {{were three}} {{telephones}} {{at the farm}} on the night, {{all on the same}} landline. There was usually a cordless phone with a memory-recall feature in the kitchen; a beige digital phone, also kept in the kitchen; and a cream rotary phone in the main bedroom. (There was normally a fourth phone too, a blue digital phone in the first-floor office, but it had been sent for repairs on 5 August.) The rotary phone had at some point been moved out of the bedroom and into the kitchen, where the police found it after the murders with its receiver off the hook. They found the beige digital phone under <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> magazines in the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the shock}} of the Western public, the {{practice}} of Vietnamese monks self-immolating was not unprecedented. Instances of self-immolations in Vietnam had been recorded for centuries, usually carried out to honor Gautama Buddha. The most recently recorded case had been in North Vietnam in 1950. The French colonial authorities had tried to eradicate the practice after their conquest of Vietnam in the nineteenth century, but had not been totally successful. They did manage to prevent one monk from setting fire to himself in Huế in the 1920s, but he managed to starve himself to death instead. During the 1920s and 1930s, Saigon newspapers reported multiple instances of self-immolations by monks in a matter-of-fact style. The practice had also been seen in the Chinese city of Harbin in 1948 when a monk seated down in the lotus position on <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> sawdust and soybean oil and set fire to himself in protest against the treatment of Buddhism by the communists of Mao Zedong. His heart remained intact, as did that of Đức.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{disagreement}} with Harrington (who subsequently formed the Third Way), and objections over {{the direction the}} party was heading, in 1989, Griffin left the National Front. Along with Holland and Fiore, he helped form the International Third Position (ITP), a development of the Political Soldier movement, but left the organisation in 1990. In the same year, he lost his left eye when a discarded shotgun cartridge exploded in <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> burning wood, since when he has worn a glass eye. The accident left him unable to work, and owing to other financial problems he subsequently petitioned for bankruptcy (the accident occurred in France, where he later lost money in a failed business project). For several years thereafter, he abstained from politics and was supported financially by his parents. He later stewarded a public Holocaust denial meeting hosted by David Irving.|$|E

60|$|A {{glass of}} water, a few dry biscuits, and <b>a</b> little <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> books--some turned face-downwards--were by his side.
