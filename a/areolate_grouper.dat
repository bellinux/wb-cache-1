50|$|The <b>areolate</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus areolatus) is a fish of a genus of groupers. It is {{a marine}} fish that inhabits coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific region. They are {{produced}} through aquaculture and commercially fished. They currently face no threats to their survival.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} body weight, water {{temperature}} and ration size on ammonia excretion {{rates of the}} <b>areolated</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus areolatus and the mangrove snapper Lutjanus argentimaculatus were investigated. Under given experimental conditions, L. argentimaculatus had a higher weight-specific ammonia excretion rate than E. areolatus. Weight-specific ammonia excretion rates of fasted individuals of both species showed an inverse relationship with body weight (W, g wet wt.), but a positive relationship with water temperature (t, °C). The relationships for total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) were: E. areolatus: TAN (mg N kg- 1 d- 1) = 21. 4. exp(0. 11 t) · W- 0. 43 (r 2 = 0. 919, n = 60); L. argentimaculatus: TAN (mg N kg- 1 d- 1) = 121. 5 · exp(0. 12 t) · W- 0. 55 (r 2 = 0. 931, n = 60). Following feeding, the weight-specific ammonia excretion rate of E. areolatus increased, peaked at 2 to 12 h (depending on temperature), and returned to pre-feeding levels within 24 h. A similar pattern was observed for L. argentimaculatus, with a peak of TAN excretion being found 6 to 12 h after feeding. Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that weight-specific TAN excretion rates of both species increased with increasing temperature and ration (R, percent body wt. d- 1) : E. areolatus: TAN (mg N kg- 1 d- 1) = 22. 8 · t - 28. 8 · R 378. 2 (r 2 = 0. 832, n = 24); L. argentimaculatus: TAN (mg N kg- 1 d- 1) = 22. 9 · t - 25. 4 · R 216. 4 (r 2 = 0. 611, n = 24). The effect of body weight on weight-specific postprandial TAN excretion was not significant in either species (p > 0. 05). This study provides empirical data for estimating ammonia excretion of these two species under varying conditions. This has application for culture management. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} review of 23 {{published}} case studies, the main {{objective is to}} report the emergence and epidemiology of ciguatera in the coastal cities of southern China. There was a sudden surge in ciguatera outbreaks in 2004. Ciguatera mostly occurred in the Guangdong Province. In Shenzhen, the incidence of ciguatera in 2004 {{was estimated to be}} over 7. 5 per million people. In Foshan and Zhongshan, three large outbreaks each affecting over 100 – 200 subjects (caused by tiger grouper served at banquets) accounted for the much higher incidence of ciguatera in 2004 (> 48. 7 and > 129. 9 per million people). Humphead wrasse and <b>areolated</b> coral <b>grouper</b> were the other important ciguatoxic fish. In some subjects, risk factors for increased likelihood of (severe) ciguatera were present, namely concomitant alcohol consumption and ingestion of large reef fishes and CTX-rich fish parts. To prevent large outbreaks and severe illness, large apex predators from coral reefs should never be served at banquets and the public should realize the increased risk of severe symptoms due to ingestion of CTX-rich fish parts with alcohol. The systematic collection of accurate details, implementation of risk assessment process and continuing education for the public on prevention are of obvious importance...|$|R
50|$|Like other groupers, the <b>areolate</b> <b>grouper</b> is a sex-changing species; {{young are}} female, and some change to male with maturity. Maturity is reached at a fork length of 22 cm, and {{spawning}} usually occurs {{during the months}} of May, June, October and December.|$|E
5000|$|Grouper {{consistently}} {{demands a}} high market price, so fishing pressure is intense. To alleviate {{the pressure on}} wild grouper stocks, many nations have promoted aquaculture {{in the hopes of}} producing a more sustainable grouper yield. Hong Kong is the primary producer of <b>areolate</b> <b>grouper</b> raised by aquaculture, and about 155 metric tons were produced in 2004. Full-cycle culture of most grouper species, including the <b>areolate</b> <b>grouper,</b> is not yet possible, although several important advances have been made in recent years. For this reason, about two-thirds of all grouper culture, including culture of E. areolatus, involves the capture of wild grouper eggs which are then grown out in aquaculture. This is called capture-based aquaculture (CBA). The wild eggs are gathered by a variety of artisianal methods, and because success is not predictable, the production varies as well.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>areolate</b> <b>grouper</b> is a {{large fish}} (up to 47 cm long, 1.4 kg) that lives near coral reefs. Its {{coloration}} is whitish to gray with rounded brownish spots; it is particularly identifiable by a narrow, white, straight margin on its truncate tail. It has 11 dorsal spines, 15-17 dorsal soft rays, 3 anal spines and 8 anal soft rays.|$|E
50|$|According to FishBase, the <b>areolate</b> <b>grouper</b> {{is known}} by several other common names in English, {{including}} the areolate rock cod, squaretail rock cod, yellow-spotted rock cod, green-spotted rock cod, and flat-tailed cod. Several Middle Eastern and Asian languages have common names for this fish, as well. It is often {{confused with the}} brownspotted grouper (Epinephelus chlorostigma) found in the Persian Gulf and several other many-spotted species.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>areolate</b> <b>grouper</b> {{is found}} in the {{tropical}} region ranging from 35°N - 33°S, 29°E - 180°E. [...] They are found in the Indo-Pacific region from the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf to Natal, South Africa and east to Fiji, north to Japan, south to the Arafura Sea and northern Australia. It was recently recorded to have been observed in Tonga, but appears to be absent from areas in the western Indian Ocean.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>areolate</b> <b>grouper</b> is one {{of about}} 16 species of {{groupers}} commonly raised using aquaculture. [...] Floating net cages, the primary culture method, are supported by a floating frame of plastic pipe, wood, or other material, and usually are anchored to the sea floor. This method is simple, has low capital investment, and uses existing bodies of water, so production can be easily increased or decreased. Disadvantages compared to pond culture include vulnerability to external water quality problems and predators. Also, no control over water temperature, which is known to strongly affect growth rates, is possible.|$|E

40|$|Assessing {{patterns}} of connectivity {{at the community}} and population levels is relevant to marine resource management and conservation. The present study reviews this issue {{with a focus on}} the western Indian Ocean (WIO) biogeographic province. This part of the Indian Ocean holds more species than expected from current models of global reef fish species richness. In this study, checklists of reef fish species were examined to determine levels of endemism in each of 10 biogeographic provinces of the Indian Ocean. Results showed that the number of endemic species was higher in the WIO than in any other region of the Indian Ocean. Endemic species from the WIO on the average had a larger body size than elsewhere in the tropical Indian Ocean. This suggests an effect of peripheral speciation, as previously documented in the Hawaiian reef fish fauna, relative to other sites in the tropical western Pacific. To explore evolutionary dynamics of species across biogeographic provinces and infer mechanisms of speciation, we present and compare the results of phylogeographic surveys based on compilations of published and unpublished mitochondrial DNA sequences for 19 Indo-Pacific reef-associated fishes (rainbow grouper Cephalopholis argus, scrawled butterflyfish Chaetodon meyeri, bluespot mullet Crenimugil sp. A, humbug damselfish Dascyllus abudafur/Dascyllus aruanus, <b>areolate</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus areolatus, blacktip grouper Epinephelus fasciatus, honeycomb grouper Epinephelus merra, bluespotted cornetfish Fistularia commersonii, cleaner wrasse Labroides sp. 1, longface emperor Lethrinus sp. A, bluestripe snapper Lutjanus kasmira, unicornfishes Naso brevirosris, Naso unicornis and Naso vlamingii, blue-spotted maskray Neotrygon kuhlii, largescale mullet Planiliza macrolepis, common parrotfish Scarus psicattus, crescent grunter Terapon jarbua, whitetip reef shark Triaenodon obelus) and three coastal Indo-West Pacific invertebrates (blue seastar Linckia laevigata, spiny lobster Panulirus homarus, small giant clam Tridacna maxima). Heterogeneous and often unbalanced sampling design, paucity of data in a number of cases, and among-species discrepancy in phylogeographic structure precluded any generalization regarding phylogeographic patterns. Nevertheless, the WIO might have been a source of haplotypes in some cases and it also harboured an endemic clade in at least one case. The present survey also highlighted likely cryptic species. This may eventually affect the accuracy of the current checklists of species, which form the basis of some of the recent advances in Indo-West Pacific marine ecology and biogeography...|$|E
