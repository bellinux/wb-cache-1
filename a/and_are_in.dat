5|$|As an {{independent}} company, Obsidian believes {{that they must}} act and react quickly to market changes and not stagnate on any certain point. While the core focus of Obsidian was still developing character-driven role-playing games, the team were willing to try out projects that are smaller <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> different genres. The decision to develop Armored Warfare is one result of this strategy.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Henry W. Bates. When an edible prey animal comes to resemble, even slightly, a distasteful animal, natural selection favours those individuals that even very slightly better resemble the distasteful species. This is because {{even a small}} degree of protection reduces predation and increases the chance that an individual mimic will survive and reproduce. For example, many species of hoverfly are coloured black and yellow like bees, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> consequence avoided by birds (and people).|$|E

5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E

5|$|A {{teaspoon}} of seawater contains about 50 million viruses. Most {{of these are}} bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> fact essential to the regulation of marine and freshwater ecosystems; however, they are also important mortality agents of phytoplankton, {{the base of the}} foodchain in aquatic environments. They infect and destroy bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, and {{are one of the most}} important mechanisms of recycling carbon and nutrient cycling in marine environments. The organic molecules released from the dead bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth, in a process known as the viral shunt. Viral activity may also affect the biological pump, the process whereby carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean.|$|E
5|$|Both {{groups have}} a shell {{consisting}} of two valves, but {{the organization of the}} shell is quite different in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are positioned on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, the valves are on the left and right sides of the body, <b>and</b> <b>are,</b> <b>in</b> most cases, mirror images of one other. Brachiopods have a lophophore, a coiled, rigid cartilaginous internal apparatus adapted for filter feeding, a feature shared with two other major groups of marine invertebrates, the bryozoans and the phoronids. Brachiopod shells are often made of calcium phosphate as well as calcium carbonate, whereas bivalve shells are composed entirely of calcium carbonate.|$|E
5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} demonstrates close coevolution of {{host and}} parasite, {{for example in}} cuckoos. These birds do not make their own nests, but lay their eggs in nests of other species, ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong {{negative impact on the}} host's reproductive fitness. Their eggs are camouflaged as eggs of their hosts, implying that hosts can distinguish their own eggs from those of intruders <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> an evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo between camouflage and recognition. Cuckoos are counter-adapted to host defences with features such as thickened eggshells, shorter incubation (so their young hatch first), and flat backs adapted to lift eggs out of the nest.|$|E

5|$|Consisting of two quasars with a {{separation}} of less than 5 arcseconds, the quasar pair 4C 11.50 {{is one of the}} visually closest pairs of quasars in the sky. The two have markedly different redshifts, however, and are thus unrelated. The foreground member of the pair (4C 11.50 A) does not have enough mass to refract light from the background component (4C 11.50 B) enough to produce a lensed image, although it does have a true companion of its own. An even stranger galaxy pair is 3C 321. Unlike the previous pair, the two galaxies making up 3C 321 are interacting with each other <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the process of merging. Both members appear to be active galaxies; the primary radio galaxy may be responsible for the activity in the secondary by means of the former's jet driving material onto the latter's supermassive black hole.|$|E
5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} {{have been}} observed swallowing city pigeons in St. James's Park in London. Spokeswoman for the Royal Parks Louise Wood opined that feeding on other birds is more likely with captive pelicans that live in a semi-urban environment <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> constant close contact with humans. However, in southern Africa eggs and chicks of the Cape cormorant are an important food source for great white pelicans. Several other bird species have been recorded in the diet of this pelican in South Africa, including Cape gannet chicks on Malgas Island as well as crowned cormorants, kelp gulls, greater crested terns and African penguins on Dassen Island and elsewhere. The Australian pelican, which is particularly {{willing to take a}} wide range of prey items, has been recorded feeding on young Australian white ibis, and young and adult grey teals and silver gulls. Brown pelicans have been reported preying on young common murres in California as well as the eggs and nestlings of cattle egrets and nestling great egrets in Baja California, Mexico. Peruvian pelicans in Chile have been recorded feeding on nestlings of imperial shags, juvenile Peruvian diving petrels and grey gulls. Cannibalism of chicks of their own species is known from the Australian, brown and Peruvian pelicans.|$|E
