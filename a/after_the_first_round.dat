5|$|Scotland {{qualified}} for their fifth consecutive World Cup in 1990 by finishing second in their qualifying group, ahead of France. Scotland were drawn {{in a group}} with Costa Rica, Sweden, and Brazil, but the Scots lost 1–0 to Costa Rica. While they recovered to beat Sweden 2–1 in their second game, they lost to Brazil in their third match 1–0 and were again eliminated <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>round.</b>|$|E
5|$|Three Egyptian athletes {{qualified}} for the Olympic modern pentathlon tournament, two men and one woman. Aya Medany, {{a veteran of the}} 2004 and 2008 Games, was the most experienced of the three, having competed internationally since 1999 at the age of 10. She won the 2011 African Championships to earn her spot in London, which was her fifth title at the tournament since 2004. In the women's event in London, she won 20 of her fencing bouts and was ranked joint-eighth <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>round.</b> She was 18th in swimming, 19th in riding, and 21st in the combined running/shooting portion to finish 16th overall. On the men's side, Yasser Hefny won the 2011 African Championships and entered the men's event in London, where he won 17 of his fencing bouts and was ranked joint-thirteenth <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>round.</b> He was 19th in the swimming, 28th in riding, and 31st in the combined running/shooting competition to finish 28th overall.|$|E
5|$|Cumberland, officially {{known as}} Central Cumberland, were a rugby league team in 1908 {{based in the}} region of Cumberland Plain in western Sydney. They were one of the nine {{original}} teams in the first New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) season, albeit admitted <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>round</b> of matches had already been played. They are the shortest lived team in the history of first-grade rugby league in Australia after disbanding late that year. Statistically, they are the club with the poorest all-time record, only lasting eight games in their inaugural and only season.|$|E

5|$|A {{water polo}} tournament {{was held on}} the Seine on 11 and 12 August 1900 {{as part of the}} 1900 Summer Olympics. Eight teams from four countries, all European, entered the event, {{although}} only seven ended up playing. The Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester, England, which has been listed with two rosters that are nearly entirely different, became the first Olympic water polo champions by defeating the Brussels Swimming and Water Polo Club of Belgium.

He won a bronze medal with another brother, Omar, at the 2009 World Modern Pentathlon Championships and eventually qualified for the 2012 Olympics by virtue of his world ranking. He received a berth during the second round of Olympic allocations, when spots won by nations who qualified more than the maximum two athletes were redistributed. In London he was victorious in 18 of his fencing bouts and was ranked joint-11th <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>round,</b> but then won the swimming event with an Olympic record time of 1:55.70. He placed 33rd and 34th in the riding and combined riding/shooting competition, however, and finished 33rd overall.|$|E
5|$|Beijing {{was elected}} {{as the host}} city for the 2008 Summer Olympics on 13 July 2001, during the 112th IOC Session in Moscow, {{defeating}} bids from Toronto, Paris, Istanbul, and Osaka. Prior to the session, five other cities (Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, and Seville) had submitted bids to the IOC, but {{failed to make the}} short list chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>round</b> of voting, Beijing held a significant lead over the other four candidates. Osaka received only six votes and was eliminated. In the second round, Beijing was supported by a majority of voters, eliminating the need for subsequent rounds. Toronto's bid was their 5th failure since 1960 (failed bid for 1960, 1964, 1976 and 1996 games losing to Rome, Tokyo, Montreal and Atlanta).|$|E
5|$|Coulthard {{started the}} race {{alongside}} Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher who began from pole position.

During {{the course of the}} second stint of the race, Michael Schumacher began to struggle with tyre wear, allowing Coulthard to close the gap and passed him on lap 40. Coulthard maintained his lead through the second round of pit stops and won the race. Michael Schumacher retired on lap 59 with an engine failure promoting Häkkinen into second position. Barrichello took third, ahead of BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve in fourth.|$|E

5|$|Much {{like in the}} Ski Jumping World Cup, {{events are}} {{composed}} of usually one or two individual competitions (rarely three, {{as was the case}} in both Vikersund and Planica during the 2016 season), with a qualification round before each one. If there are two competitions, qualification for the second one takes place on the same day. The limit of 40 places per competition still applies (unless a cancelled ski jumping competition is rescheduled to a flying hill), but unlike the Ski Flying World Championships, if an athlete fails to qualify for one competition they still have the opportunity to make a fresh start and qualify for the others. If the very last competition of a World Cup season takes place on a ski flying hill, only 30 athletes will participate, with neither an elimination process <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>round,</b> nor a qualification round.|$|E
5|$|One such {{solution}} is by bidding: Players take turns bidding {{on how many}} moves it will take them to win the game. The lowest bidder gets the king. Thus, one player may open with a bid of 15turns, the other player may counter with a bid of 14turns, and the first player, more confident {{in his ability to}} escape in 13rounds than in his ability to contain for 14, may bid 13 and take the king's side. If that player does not escape within 13turns, the other player wins. Another workaround is to play a two-round match, in which players switch sides <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>round.</b> If the king escapes both rounds, the winner is the player whose king escaped in the fewest turns.|$|E
5|$|To have {{a chance}} of winning a competition, two {{consistently}} good jumps must be made. If an athlete finds themselves in an uncompetitive position <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>round,</b> their challenge in the second round is to make up ground via the attrition of other athletes, their own distance and style points, and wind/gate compensation. For an athlete who had a poor jump in round one, it is possible for them to climb up the order in round two with an excellent jump, and if other competitors fall by the wayside. Conversely, a high-scoring athlete may lose their advantage from round one if their second jump is not up to par.|$|E

5|$|A mock-up was {{manufactured}} in Japan after Kawasaki won the contract. It was shipped to Singapore {{and put on}} public display during the 1984 National Exhibition held in November 1984 at World Trade Centre. The mock-up featured three choices of seating arrangements and colour schemes; {{members of the public}} were invited to give feedback on these options. The finalised interior design of the C151 trains consisted of a fully longitudinal seating arrangement. The bucket seats were made of plastic; glass partitions separated the seating areas from the passenger doors. Strap lines for standing passengers were installed in the middle of every car. The colour scheme of each adjacent car's interior is distinct to make car identification in cases of fault reporting easier for passengers. Originally the colour scheme of the driving trailer cars was orange, that of the second and fifth motor cars was blue, and that of the two centre motor cars was green. There were nine seats between two doors; this was reduced to seven <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>round</b> of refurbishment.|$|E
5|$|The semi-final {{round of}} the tournament took place {{immediately}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>round,</b> and Mr. Perfect gained the early advantage over Bret Hart. Hart reversed {{the momentum of the}} match by applying a series of headlocks on Perfect. Perfect then performed a dropkick on Hart and followed it up by pushing him {{off the edge of the}} ring into the steel barricade on the arena floor. Perfect then performed another dropkick, but Hart recovered and executed a superplex on Perfect. Hart wore down Perfect's leg with a figure four leglock and attempted to perform the Sharpshooter, his finishing maneuver. Perfect blocked the move and attempted to perform the Perfectplex, his finishing move, on Hart. Hart reversed this move, however, and both men were thrown out of the ring. When they returned to the ring, Perfect tried to pin Hart with a small package. Hart reversed the move to get the pinfall victory and advance to the tournament final.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} resumed {{three weeks}} later in China, with the lead-in period to the race marked by Lotus F1 protesting the legality of Mercedes's rear wing design. The FIA rejected the protest, and with Mercedes allowed to continue racing with their car unchanged, Nico Rosberg took his – and the team's – first pole position since their return to Formula One in , while a penalty to Lewis Hamilton for a gearbox change promoted Michael Schumacher to second on the grid. Schumacher would ultimately retire from the race <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>round</b> of stops when {{it was discovered that}} one of his wheels had not been attached properly. Rosberg took an early lead in the race, and while his attempt to complete the race with only two pit stops came under threat from second-placed Jenson Button, a mistake by Button's pit crew during his final stop handed Rosberg a nineteen-second advantage over Kimi Räikkönen. Räikkönen was attempting a similar two-stop strategy, but his tyres wore out seven laps {{from the end of the}} race, and he lost eleven positions in a single lap. This forced Rosberg to drive conservatively to preserve his tyres while Button recovered from his disastrous pit stop to pass Sebastian Vettel for second. Button was held up by the incumbent World Champion long enough for Rosberg to preserve his tyres, and he became the 103rd person to win a Grand Prix. The result was also Mercedes's first win as a constructor since Juan Manuel Fangio won the 1955 Italian Grand Prix. Button was second, with Hamilton scoring his third consecutive third place, giving him a two-point championship lead over Button; Fernando Alonso, who had been leading the championship before the race, finished ninth. After two retirements in the opening rounds of the championship, Romain Grosjean scored his first points in Formula One by finishing sixth.|$|E
