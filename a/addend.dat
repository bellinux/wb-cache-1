500|$|In practice, {{computational}} addition may {{be achieved}} via XOR and AND bitwise logical operations {{in conjunction with}} bitshift operations {{as shown in the}} pseudocode below. Both XOR and AND gates are straightforward to realize in digital logic allowing the realization of full adder circuits which in turn may be combined into more complex logical operations. In modern digital computers, integer addition is typically the fastest arithmetic instruction, yet it has the largest impact on performance, since it underlies all floating-point operations as well as such basic tasks as address generation during memory access and fetching instructions during branching. To increase speed, modern designs calculate digits in parallel; these schemes go by such names as carry select, carry lookahead, and the Ling pseudocarry. Many implementations are, in fact, hybrids of these last three designs. Unlike addition on paper, addition on a computer often changes the addends. On the ancient abacus and adding board, both addends are destroyed, leaving only the sum. The influence of the abacus on mathematical thinking was strong enough that early Latin texts often claimed that in the process of adding [...] "a number to a number", both numbers vanish. In modern times, the ADD instruction of a microprocessor often replaces the augend with the sum but preserves the <b>addend.</b> In a high-level programming language, evaluating [...] does not change either a or b; if the goal is to replace a with the sum this must be explicitly requested, typically with the statement [...] Some languages such as C or C++ allow this to be abbreviated as [...]|$|E

Letters represent variables and constants.

If the <b>addends</b> are four or more, more than one layer of compressors is necessary, and there are various possible design for the circuit: the most common are Dadda and Wallace trees. This kind of circuit is most notably used in multipliers, which is why these circuits are also known as Dadda and Wallace multipliers.|$|R

If the <b>addends</b> are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|R

5000|$|A {{commonly}} used and elegant example of cognitive strategies comes from small-number addition. There are numerous different ways (i.e., different strategies) by {{which one can}} get the sum of two (let's say) one digit numbers, for example 3+4 (=7). The way that most adults would solve this problem is by simply remembering the answer (a [...] "memory" [...] strategy), but a toddler would probably use {{one of a number}} of different finger-counting strategies. For example, one can represent the first <b>addend</b> (3) on one's left hand by raising three fingers, and then do the same with four fingers on the right hand, and then count up the number of fingers that are raised. But there are many other ways to do this. For example, one can do the same first step (raise three fingers on one's left hand), and then start counting from 4 as one raises four more fingers one at a time on either the right hand, or even starting from the fourth finger on the left hand (which would require continuing from 6 on the right hand). Different strategies may have very different characteristics in terms of their time and space complexity, memory requirements, etc., and therefore in terms of their error characteristics.|$|E
