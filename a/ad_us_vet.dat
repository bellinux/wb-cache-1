Animals in the nalbuphine group received 2  mg/kg nalbuphine subcutaneously for analgesia after anaesthesia induction, but prior to instrumentation, the subcutaneous administration of nalbuphine {{in combination with}} lidocaine was requested by the animal ethics committee {{in order to avoid}} post-operative pain after termination of isoflurane anaesthesia. Placebo animals received a subcutaneous injection of normal saline (2  ml/kg). After instrumentation, a nalbuphine infusion was started at a dose of 1  mg/kg/h. After 15  min, the dose was increased to 5  mg/kg/h for another 15  min. After each phase, blood sampling and hemodynamic monitoring was performed (Fig.  1).

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the effect of a {{prophylactic}} treatment with the homeopathic drug Engystol® <b>ad</b> <b>us.</b> <b>vet.</b> in combination with own blood and Carduus and Coenzyme compositum in 34 Icelandic horses with a predisposition for summer eczema (SE). As the outbreak of SE could not be prevented, a therapy with Traumeel® <b>ad</b> <b>us.</b> <b>vet.</b> in the same combination was added. Changes in the clinical appearance of the patients (alteration of skin quality, grade of pruritus) were evaluated on the basis of a specially developed index. At the same time a monitoring of disease progression was conducted by means of differential haemogram analyses, the functional in-vitro-tests histamine release test (HRT) and cellular antigen stimulation test (CAST) using a specially generated extract from Culicoides nubeculosus. Comparative studies in horses with and without a predisposition for summer eczema were carried out during winter time to answer the question whether the diagnosis of SE is possible with the above mentioned in-vitro-tests also in asymptomatic horses. To gain further insight into the pathogenesis of SE the acute phase proteins c-reactive protein (CRP) and haptoglobin were recorded. The cause of SE in the investigation area was determined by using midge traps. The following results were obtained: 1. During the phase of prophylaxis a highly significant (p < 0, 001) reduction in the number of lymphocytes towards the outbreak of SE in the horses of the placebo group was detected. This decrease was clearly weaker in the verum group and showed no significance at any time. The outbreak of SE could be deferred - but not significant. 2. The therapy applied after the onset of SE led to a highly significant (p < 0, 001) reduction in the grade of pruritus in all 34 Icelandic horses within one week. Also the index of dermatitis showed a decrease after one week (p < 0, 01) as well as after 2 and 3 weeks (p < 0, 001). A positive effect of the prophylactic treatment with Engystol® <b>ad</b> <b>us.</b> <b>vet.</b> was determined as the pretreated horses showed a highly significant (p < 0, 01) improvement in the index of dermatitis already after one week whereas the horses of the placebo group showed a significant reduction (p < 0, 05) after 2 respectively 3 (p < 0, 01) weeks. The achievement of the therapy was clearly certified by interrupting the treatment in August followed by resumption with 26 remaining Icelandic horses. The decrease in the grade of pruritus as well as in the index of dermatitis showed high significance (p < 0, 001) already one week after the restart of therapy. 3. For the monitoring of a long-term treatment of SE with Traumeel® <b>ad</b> <b>us.</b> <b>vet.</b> in the combination with own blood only 28 Icelandic horses remained available due to cases of disease, sales or changes in habitation. The amount of total histamine contained in the basophile granulocytes showed a clear increase from 56, 1  22, 3 ng/ml before therapy to 74, 8  36, 1 ng/ml 2 weeks (p < 0, 05), 75, 9  26, 5 ng/ml 4 weeks (p < 0, 01) and 92, 3  30, 2 ng/ml 6 weeks (p < 0, 001) after therapy. During the following 12 weeks the content of total histamine remained highly significant (p < 0, 001) above the level before treatment. At the same time a decrease of the histamine release in percent from the granulocytes after stimulation with the allergen extract occured from 43, 9  16, 5 % to 27, 4  14, 4 % 4 weeks after therapy (p < 0, 01). The histamine release averaged 30, 4  19, 0 % and 29, 7  12, 1 % at six respectively eight weeks after the beginning of treatment and was therefore significantly lower (p < 0, 05) than before therapy. This indicates an increasing desensitisation and therewith stabilisation of the basophil granulocytes evoked by the therapy applied. The pretreatment of the horses with Engystol® <b>ad</b> <b>us.</b> <b>vet.</b> again showed a remarkable positive effect, as the amount of total histamine contained in the basophils increased significantly 2 weeks earlier in the verum group. Furthermore a highly significant rise in the level of total histamine was achieved four (p < 0, 01) and six (p < 0, 001) weeks earlier than in the placebo group. Only in the pretreated group a reduction of the histamine release in percent was detected at four (44, 5  11, 8 %  20, 1  14, 8 %, p < 0, 01) and six weeks (44, 5  11, 8 %  27, 2  16, 7 %, p < 0, 001) after therapy, whereas the former placebo group did not show a significantly declined histamine release at any time. These results indicate, that also the prophylaxis has the ability to stabilise the content of total histamine of the basophils as well as to exert a moderating influence on the response towards the allergen. 4. By means of comparative studies on six horses with predisposition for SE and 7 healthy controls during winter time an average amount of total histamine of 64, 5  18, 6 ng/ml in the horses with predisposition compared to 109, 2  29, 0 ng/ml in the controls was determined. The mean histamine release obtained was 60, 1 %  18, 2 % in the disposed horses in contrast to 2, 3 %  1, 6 % in the healthy animals. In the CAST the horses with a predisposition for SE produced significantly more (2835, 9 pg/ml  1576, 3 pg/ml) sLT than non disposed horses (528, 7 pg/ml  319, 6 pg/ml, p < 0, 05). Thus the CAST and HRT were proven to be reliable tests to differentiate between horses with and without a predisposition for SE even during asymptomatic phases. The mean level of C-reactive protein (CRP) obtained in the sera of the horses with a disposition for SE was 17, 3  4, 2 µg/ml. This was highly significant lower than in the sera of the non disposed horses (51, 3  17, 3 µg/ml, p < 0, 001). Further research would be of great interest to provide deeper insight into the role of CRP in the pathogenesis of SE in Icelandic horses. The average level of haptoglobin detected in the disposed horses was clearly higher (1, 31  1, 24 mg/ml) than in the healthy controls (0, 80  0, 65 mg/ml) although their difference did not reach significance. 5. During the entire period of this study the actual occurrence of the Culicoides-subspecies in the investigation area was determined using special midge traps (soil- and air-traps). C. obsoletus was proven to be the most numerous subspecies which also showed presence during the whole season. A two-phase course of occurrence with a maximum in July respectively September/October was determined for C. obsoletus, which apparently represents the main cause for SE in the area under investigation. C. pulicaris can be considered as an additional initiator...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the effects of {{medicated}} feed, Rupin Special gran. <b>ad</b> <b>us.</b> <b>vet.</b> with oxytetracyclini chloridum as active ingredient (5 g·kg- 1 feed), on physical and chemical characteristics of a pond ecosystem and the health of carp of two age groups in a pilot operation. The medicated feed was administered in 8 doses (15 g·kg- 1 live weight). In the study, temperature, oxygen concentration, pH, microbiological, hydrobiological and hydrochemical variables of pond water were monitored. The fish health assessment was based on clinical, pathological-morphological and haematological examinations of 80 individuals in total. The examinations were made before, during, immediately after and 15 days after the administration of medicated feed. No effects on water quality were found. An important histological change after the application of 8 doses was the loss of haematopoietic tissue from the spleen, and dystrophic changes in the renal duct epithelium. A decrease in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts and in total blood plasma protein concentrations (P < 0. 05) were observed already after the 3 rd dose of Rupin Special. It follows from the results of the study that Rupin Special should be used in only 4 (exceptionally 6) doses, compared to the originally recommended 8 doses...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{in this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of the homotoxicologic drugs Lachesis comp. <b>ad</b> <b>us.</b> <b>vet.</b> ®, Carduus comp. <b>ad</b> <b>us.</b> <b>vet.</b> ® and Traumeel® for the prevention of endometritis in dairy cows. The study was conducted as a randomised, controlled and blinded field- trial on a conventional dairy farm in Brandenburg. Two protocols of therapy were compared to a placebo group. A total of 593 animals (404 dairy cows, 189 heifers) were included into this study. The drugs were injected subcutaneously four times at weekly intervals. The first injection was given within 24 hours after calving. The first examination of the study animals was carried out {{on the day of the}} last injection (PK 1, 21. - 27. day pp). Uterine involution and ovarian follicular development was monitored by visual inspection, rectal palpation and by ultrasonography. At the same time, blood samples from the coccygeal vein were taken from 291 animals. To determine the resumption of cyclic activity, the concentration of serum progesterone was measured. Also, the concentrations of betahydroxybutyrat (BHBA) and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) in blood serum were examined to establish the metabolic status of the animals. If endometritis or deficient ovarian activity was diagnosed, the examination was repeated at PK 2 (28. - 34. day pp) and PK 3 (35. – 41 day pp), respectively. Data from all animals were collected including history of calving, retained placenta and twins. If study animals showed signs of sickness like serious injuries because of calving, displaced abomasum, hypocalcaemia or anomalies of the uterus they were excluded from the study. Animals, which were treated systemically or intrauterine with antibiotics or hormones within 72 days after calving were excluded equally. All results of examination were documented and classified. The interpretation of the results from examinations were made for all animals as well as for cows and heifers. Regarding frequency or severity of endometritis, a positive influence of the homotoxicologic drugs could not be found for any date of examination. Resumption of ovarian activity did not differ significantly between the three study groups as well as the distribution of BHBA- and NEFA- concentration in blood serum. Days to first service, days open, first- service conception rate and conception rate were determinated. The differences between the groups were not significant. The reason for leaving was documented and analyzed for all animals, left the dairy farm within 200 days pp. There were no significant differences between the groups, also. Our data show that the homotoxicologic drugs and protocols of therapy evaluated {{in this study was}} not efficacious. Further research is required to investigate the possibilities of a different combination of homotoxicologic drugs or different times of treatment...|$|E
40|$|Verification of the {{efficacy}} of Biocan ® B inj. <b>ad</b> <b>us.</b> <b>vet.</b> (Bioveta, a. s.) was done by challenge testing. Ticks collected in the nature were used as natural vectors of the infection. Six beagles and two control ones {{were used in the}} test. Formation of outer surface protein A specific antibodies (OspA antibodies) and borrelia specific immonoglobulins (IgG) was measured by Western blot and EIA in the sera samples. The tissue samples were used for detection of bor-reliae by cultivation method and dark field microscopy (DFM). Formation of IgG antibodies and OspA antibodies after vaccination was observed. The maximum titer level of antibodies was reached between 21. and 49. day after vac-cination and then slowly decreased. Presence of borreliae was detected only in skin biopsies of non-vaccinated dogs. The post mortem tissue samples showed presence of borreliae in all of the samples of the non-vaccinated dogs. The tissues of the vaccinated dogs were not infected with borreliae, except for two samples of dog with low titer levels of OspA antibodies. The development of the new vaccine is based on preparation of recombinant outer surface proteins (e. g. rOspA and rOspC) of B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi and B. garinii origin. Chosen recombinant proteins were successfully expressed in E. coli. The obtained purified proteins are currently being tested on laboratory BALB/c mice. Formation of specific antibodies against some recombinant proteins has been confirmed. These proteins are suitable candidates for preparation of a vaccine prototype and they will be subsequently used in challenge tests...|$|E
