Shooting a pistol with one hand is normally associated with gunslingers, and is also a standard for them of the era to carry two guns and fire ambidextrously. Capt. Jonathan R.

As a result of the cycling, he has lost 25 pounds from his final playing weight of 240 pounds.|$|E

For women, this most frequently emphasizes a curvy figure by reducing the waist and thereby exaggerating the bust <b>and</b> <b>hips.</b> However, in some periods, corsets have been worn to achieve a tubular straight-up-and-down shape, which involved minimizing the bust <b>and</b> <b>hips.</b>|$|R

5|$|During the 1980s, glam metal {{became popular}} with {{groups such as}} Mötley Crüe and Poison. Underground scenes {{produced}} an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded {{the definition of the}} genre. These include groove metal (with bands such as Pantera, Sepultura, and Lamb of God) and nu metal (with bands such as Korn, Slipknot, and Linkin Park), the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> hop.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 American film {{directors}} Luke Meyer and Andrew Neel released New World Order, {{a critically}} acclaimed documentary film which explores {{the world of}} conspiracy theorists - such as American radio host Alex Jones - who consistently expose and vigorously oppose {{what they perceive as}} an emerging New World Order. The growing dissemination and popularity of conspiracy theories has also created an alliance between right-wing populist agitators (such as Alex Jones) <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> hop music's left-wing populist rappers (such as KRS-One, Professor Griff of Public Enemy and Immortal Technique), thus illustrating how anti-elitist conspiracism can create unlikely political allies in efforts to oppose a political system.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} joint immobilization on the postural sway during quiet standing. We hypothesized that center of pressure (COP), and rambling and trembling trajectories {{would be affected by}} joint immobilization. Ten young adults stood on a force plate during 60 s without and with immobilized joints (only knees constrained, CK; knees <b>and</b> <b>hips,</b> CH; <b>and</b> knees, <b>hips,</b> <b>and</b> trunk, CT), with their eyes opened (OE) or closed (CE). The root mean square deviation (RMS, the standard deviation from the mean) and mean speed of COP and the rambling and trembling trajectories in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions were analyzed. Similar effects of vision were observed for both directions: larger amplitudes for all variables were observed in the CE condition. In the anterior-posterior direction, postural sway increased only when the knees, <b>hips,</b> <b>and</b> trunk were immobilized. For the medial-lateral direction, the RMS and the mean speed of the COP and the rambling and trembling displacements decreased after immobilization of knees <b>and</b> <b>hips</b> <b>and</b> knees, <b>hips,</b> <b>and</b> trunk. These findings indicate that the inverted pendulum model is unable to completely explain the processes involved in the control of the quiet upright stance in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions...|$|R
