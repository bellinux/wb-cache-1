40|$|The {{thruster}} {{is designed}} so that ion currents to various internal surfaces can be measured directly; these measurements facilitate calculations {{of the distribution of}} ion currents inside the discharge chamber. Experiments are described suggesting that the distribution of ion currents inside the discharge chamber is strongly dependent on the shape and strength of the magnetic field but independent of the discharge current, discharge voltage, and neutral flow rate. Measurements of the energy cost per plasma ion suggest that this cost decreases with increasing magnetic field strength as a consequence of increased <b>anode</b> <b>shielding</b> from the primary electrons. Energy costs per argon plasma ion as low as 50 eV are measured. The energy cost per beam ion is found to be a function of the energy cost per plasma ion, extracted ion fraction, and discharge voltage. Part of the energy cost per beam ion has to do with creating many ions in the plasma and then extracting only a fraction of them into the beam. The balance of the energy goes into accelerating the remaining plasma ions into the walls of the discharge chamber...|$|R

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Electrical engineering. Increasing performance of vacuum insulator barriers is a common goal in large pulsed power systems. Insulator performance is continually being improved while new methods are developed. Triple point shielding techniques have been shown to increase flashover voltage, but the role of cathode vs. <b>anode</b> <b>shielding</b> is still not fully understood. Magnetic flashover inhibition has been considered but has not been experimentally confirmed for 45 degree coaxial insulators. Open circuit flashover characteristics were obtained for a coaxial geometry to view the effects of triple point shielding for this geometry. The tests included applying various combinations of triple point shields on zero degree and + 45 degree insulators. Shielding was tested at the cathode triple point outside of the dielectric and at the anode triple point inside the dielectric. Magnetic flashover inhibition was considered for 45 degree coaxial insulators. An experiment to test magnetic flashover inhibition was developed. The method could provide insight on how to configure a system to take advantage of magnetic flashover inhibition. The role of anode versus cathode triple point shielding was examined. Flashover voltage was observed to increase when either a cathode or <b>anode</b> triple point <b>shield</b> was applied; however adding a shield to both regions lowered the flashover threshold. Both triple point regions were found to be important and dependant on each other for some coaxial geometries...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of a liquid xenon Compton camera called XEMIS 2 (XEnon Medical Imaging System) is a step forward to {{a new type of}} medical imaging based on the use of 44 Sc radionuclide emitting two annihilation rays and a third high energy ray simultaneously. The single phase TPC (Time Projection Chamber) under construction, containing nearly 200 kg of xenon, is designed to measure most of the Compton interactions in the active area with a sub-millimetre position resolution and a good energy resolution of 4 % on 511 keV photopeak. The intersection of the Compton cone surface from the third ray with the line of response from the two annihilation rays allows to localize the radionuclide with a precision (FWHM) of about 1 cm along this line. The large field of view of such a liquid xenon camera combined with the 3 imaging technique will provide a good quality image while keeping the injected activity at a very low level. XEMIS 2 will be installed in the Nantes University Hospital in order to demonstrate its capability to image small animals injected with a low activity of only 20 kBq in 20 mn acquisition time. To achieve this goal, a precise measurement of the ionization signal is provided by a pixelized <b>anode,</b> <b>shielded</b> by a Frisch Grid and read out by a low noise front-end electronics. In addition, new cryogenic and purification subsystems have been tested, allowing safe recovery of xenon in liquid phase at flow rates of about 1 ton per hour...|$|R

50|$|A typical hot-cathode {{thyratron}} uses {{a heated}} filament cathode, completely contained within a shield assembly with a control grid on one open side, which faces the plate-shaped anode. In the off situation the voltage {{on the control}} grid is negative {{with respect to the}} cathode. When positive voltage is applied to the anode, no current flows. When the control electrode is made less negative, electrons from the cathode can travel to the anode because the positive attraction from the anode prevails over the negative repulsion caused by the slightly negative voltage on the control grid. The electrons will ionize the gas by collisions with the gas in the tube, and an avalanche effect results, causing an arc discharge between cathode and <b>anode.</b> The <b>shield</b> prevents ionized current paths that might form within other parts of the tube. The gas in a thyratron is typically {{at a fraction of the}} pressure of air at sea level; 15 to 30 millibars (1.5 to 3 kPa) is typical. For a cold-cathode thyratron the trigger voltage on the control grid will typically be positive, and a flash-over from control grid to cathode will initiate the arc discharge in the tube.|$|R
40|$|Electroforming {{involves}} the deposition of metals to higher thicknesses so that tbe deposit itself {{stands as a}} separate article for use in various functional applications. In this process consitlerable amount of metal is deposited at the projections, corners and edges and hence the wastage of metal is {{of the order of}} 100 - 200 % over and above the requirement. TIlis is due to the inherent nature of the electrodeposition process namely nonuniform current and metal distribution. Ions are invisible to man and their propulsion and manipulation through electrolytes is not nearly so controllable as that of electrons through metals and semiconductors at fto. ast relative to tbe purpose to be achieved. Modlncatlons of the deposit distribution pattern can be achieved by changing the geometry of the part, by using 8 uxiliarly <b>anodes</b> or <b>shields</b> or by chan~ing the rack design. Good throwing power is that property of the plating solution which produces a relatively unifonn distribution of metal upon a catlIode of irregular shape. In the present study a slotted HuU Cell has been used to study the distribution of metal on a plate kept at an inclined position with respect to the anode. It has been concluded from the study that metal distribution is as uniform as possible when metal ions are injected through narrow slots due to the scattering of electric field in the deposition cell...|$|R

The diagnostic {{consists of a}} 37 -stage Marx bank with a cable-coupled X-ray diode that produces a 35 -ns pulse of mostly 0. 71 -{angstrom} monochromatic X rays and a P- 43 fluor coupled to a cooled, charge-coupled device camera by a coherent fiber-optic bundle for detection of scattered X rays. The X-ray beam is collimated to a 1 {sup o} divergence in the scattering plane with {{the combination of a}} 1. 5 -mm tungsten pinhole and a 1. 5 -mm-diameter molybdenum anode. X rays are produced by a high-energy electron beam transiting inward from the cathode to the anode in a needle-and-washer configuration. The anode's characteristic K-{alpha} X-ray emission lines are utilized for this diffraction system. The X-ray <b>anode</b> is heavily <b>shielded</b> in all directions other than the collimated beam.

40|$|Thin oxide films {{deposited}} by reactive {{magnetron sputtering}} {{have found a}} widespread application in low cost mass-production. Using pulsed discharges and controlling the deposition in the instable transition mode by a fast closed loop circuit and piezoelectric valves for the reactive gas supply gives access to high deposition rates and advanced functional film properties. We have used a dual magnetron source powered by a sine wave MF generator. In comparison to common twin magnetrons, our dual magnetron consists of two single magnetrons. The targets were spatially separated with distance of 210 mm. Both sources were equipped with individual hidden <b>anodes</b> and plasma <b>shielding.</b> To avoid instabilities of the target state in the deposition process, we merged the reactive gas supply for both sources. We have used this magnetron in the transition mode to deposit MgO from an Mg target and indium tin oxide (ITO) using an In:Sn target. The optical extinction coefficient was about 10 - 4 for the MgO films and approximately 10 - 2 for the ITO films, being acceptable for many low cost applications. The electrical resistivity of dynamically deposited ITO films is around 10 - 3 µcm. At a power density of 3. 85 Wcm 2 in both cases a very high deposition rate could be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{industrial}} plasma coaters regarding throughput and precision necessitate {{the utilization of}} appropriate modeling tools. Thus, a parallel computing simulation environment for gas flows and gas discharges has been implemented at Fraunhofer IST. The simulation environment, called PIC-MC {{is based upon the}} particle-in-cell Monte Carlo approach. While many PIC-MC studies reported in literature are restricted to simplified two-dimensional geometries, we put much effort in enabling three-dimensional simulation studies by optimization of the underlying field solver modules in particular. This involves the parallelization of the magnetic field solver based on the boundary element method which is now capable of handling industrial sized magnetron array arrangements. Furthermore the scaling behavior of the parallel electric field solver based on the Taylor extrapolation method has been improved. With recent software optimizations and better availability of parallel high performance computing hardware, 3 D magnetron discharge simulations are now becoming feasible at low and moderate power density. In this work we present PIC-MC simulation results for a dual magnetron discharge set-up with anode bars. We especially investigate the discharge dynamic and the resulting electron flux for magnetically <b>shielded</b> <b>anodes.</b> By applying our simulation tool we can reproduce experimentally observed features such as electron flux constrictions forming local "hot spots" on the anode bars. The PIC-MC simulation allows for better understanding of this phenomenon which could severely damage the sputter equipment...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} the ion beam which is {{produced}} by the proton accelerator KALIF depends essentially on {{the properties of the}} anode and cathode plasmas and on electromagnetic fluctuations occuring in the accelerating gap of the diode. For the enhancement of the beam quality the properties of the plasma and the electromagnetic field distribution in the diode gap should be well known. In this thesis, therefore, the properties of the anode plasma were investigated. The measurements of the electron density and temperature and the composition of the anode plasma were carried out through the spectroscopic diagnostic method. The electron density varied form 1 x 10 " 1 " 6 cm"-" 3 early in the KALIF-pulse to 5 x 10 " 1 " 7 cm"-" 3 {{at the end of the}} pulse. The electron temperature grew very fast up to 7 eV early in the pulse. Apart form the hydrogen atoms and ions triple ionized carbon was dominant in the anode plasma. The density of the hydrogen atoms and ions grew continuously during the pulse. For the first time, the dynamics of the magnetic field in the anode plasma of a high-power ion diode could be measured using the Zeeman splitting of CIII and CIV lines. This measurement was time dependent and spatially-resolved. Several important consequences resulted from the diamagnetic field penetration into the anode plasma: the weaker magnetic insulation reduces the diode impedance and may even cause the electron sheath to collapse to the anode, plasma heating by the induced eddy currents leads to exponential growth of the particle density in the plasma. It was further tried to measure the growth of the beam divergence in the accelerating gap. The beam divergence could be determined from the Doppler broadening of a spectral line of carbon which existed as a natural contaminant in the anode plasma. Although the abundance of carbon in the anode plasma was sufficient for the measurement, the carbon ions were not accelerated in sufficient quantities to measure their emission lines in the accelerating gap. We suppose that a sheath of hydrogen ions in front of the <b>anode</b> plasma <b>shields</b> the electric field off from the carbon ions. A measurement performed just near the anode plasma front shows that much of the beam divergence is already created at the anode plasma front. It means that the plasma surface is spatially inhomogeneous. (orig.)

40|$|We have {{developed}} an implantable fuel cell that generates power through glucose oxidation, producing 3 : 4 mW cm{ 2 steady-state power and up to 180 mW cm{ 2 peak power. The fuel cell is manufactured using a novel approach, employing semiconductor fabrication techniques, and is therefore well suited for manufacture together with integrated circuits on a single silicon wafer. Thus, it can help enable implantable microelectronic systems with long-lifetime power sources that harvest energy from their surrounds. The fuel reactions are mediated by robust, solid state catalysts. Glucose is oxidized at the nanostructured surface of an activated platinum anode. Oxygen is reduced to water at {{the surface of a}} self-assembled network of single-walled carbon nanotubes, embedded in a Nafion film that forms the cathode and is exposed to the biological environment. The catalytic electrodes are separated by a Nafion membrane. The availability of fuel cell reactants, oxygen and glucose, only as a mixture in the physiologic environment, has traditionally posed a design challenge: Net current production requires oxidation and reduction to occur separately and selectively at the anode and cathode, respectively, to prevent electrochemical short circuits. Our fuel cell is configured in a half-open geometry that <b>shields</b> the <b>anode</b> while exposing the cathode, resulting in an oxygen gradient that strongly favors oxygen reduction at the cathode. Glucose reaches the <b>shielded</b> <b>anode</b> by diffusing through the nanotube mesh, which does not catalyze glucose oxidation, and the Nafion layers, which are permeable to small neutral and cationic species. We demonstrate computationally that the natural recirculation of cerebrospinal fluid around the human brain theoretically permits glucose energy harvesting at a rate on the order of at least 1 mW with no adverse physiologic effects. Low-power brain–machine interfaces can thus potentially benefit from having their implanted units powered or recharged by glucose fuel cells. National Institutes of Health (U. S.)

40|$|Man-made {{photovoltaic}} {{device is}} relatively efficient in converting sunlight to electricity, but the electrical energy generated {{is difficult to}} store. Current methods, such as chemical batteries, hydraulic pumping, and water splitting, suffer from low energy density or incompatibility with current transportation infrastructure. The biological systems, on the other hand, can store sunlight in high energy-density carbon-carbon bonds. However, the photosynthesis has low solar energy harvesting efficiency, for which no near-term improvements are in sight. One way to solve both problems is to combine man-made solar cells to biological Carbon dioxide (CO 2) fixation and fuel production. Therefore, a microbial process to produce biofuels from CO 2 and electricity is needed. In this work, we first used metabolic engineering methods to achieve the production of isobutanol, n-butanol, and 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol (3 MB) in a lithoautotrophic bacterium Ralstonia eutropha H 16, which can utilize formate as the sole carbon and energy source. We then demonstrated electrochemical production of formate from CO 2 and finally integrated the electrochemical reactions with the microbial fuel production. Besides achieving the goals in engineering, this work explored important design principles of metabolic pathway and developed new tools in synthetic biology. To produce higher alcoholos, two different carbon chain building routes were constructed. First, Coenzyme A (CoA) -dependent pathway was used to synthesize isobutanol and n-butanol in R. eutropha H 16. We demonstrated {{for the first time}} the production of isobutanol, a branched-chain alcohol, using the CoA-dependent pathway in recombinant R. eutropha H 16. The isobutanol production pathway deviates from the CoA-dependent n-butanol production pathway in that it contains an extra carbon chain rearrangement step catalyzed by the isobutyryl-CoA mutase in R. eutropha, which has not been characterized previously. Metabolic engineering methods such as heterologous gene expression, codon optimization, and promoter strength altering were applied to first achieve the production of ~ 200 mg/L n-butanol from fructose or ~ 30 mg/L from formate by engineered R. eutropha. The isobutyryl-CoA mutase was then added to the pathway to achieve the production of ~ 30 mg/L isobutanol from fructose. The carbon skeleton rearrangement chemistry explored here might be used to expand the repertoire of the chemicals accessible with the CoA-dependent pathway. Next, keto acid-dependent pathway was used to synthesize isobutanol and 3 MB in R. eutropha H 16. We integrated the set of genes for isobutanol and 3 MB production into R. eutropha H 16 genome, namely alsS from Bacillus subtilis, and ilvC and ilvD from Escherichia coli. The genes kivd from Lactococcus lactis and yqhD from E. coli were then introduced using a plasmid. R. entropha uses poly[R-(-) - 3 -hydroxybutyrate] (PHB) as a storage compound and as the metabolic sink for carbon and reducing equivalents. We disrupted the PHB synthesis and used the synthetic isobutanol and 3 MB production pathway as the new metabolic sink. In a pH-coupled formic acid feeding fermentor, the engineered strain LH 74 D produced fuels with the final titer of over 1. 4 g/l (~ 846 mg/l isobutanol and ~ 570 mg/l 3 MB) and peak productivity of 25 mg/l/h. Most natural metabolic pathways are regulated on transcriptional level or on protein level by allosteric effectors. In this work, non-native regulatory mechanisms were introduced to the synthetic pathways. In particular, on transcriptional level, a synthetic anhydrotetracycline (aTc) -controllable gene expression system in R. eutropha H 16 was developed and applied in regulating the biofuel production gene. The system is composed of a controllable promoter containing the operator tetO, the repressor tetR, and the inducer aTc. The active hybrids between the tetO operators and the native PrrsC were first identified and shown to be repressable by tetR. Next, two mutants of the native PphaC 1 promoter were obtained from a high-throughput screening of 300 candidates to tune the tetR expression. The optimized system, which contains the PrrsC-O 1 -O 1 hybrid promoter and the PphaC 1 -G 3 ::tetR cassette, has decreased leaky expression level and can be regulated gradually by different aTc concentration with a ~ 11 fold dynamic range. The system was used to alleviate cellular toxicity caused by AlsS overexpression, which impeded our metabolic engineering work on isobutanol production in R. eutropha H 16. The system reported in this study may be a useful tool for future research and engineering work in this organism. Finally, we combined the electrochemical formate production with the microbial fuel synthesis by the engineered host in an integrated process. The challenge was that the growth of the microbial host was inhibited by the electrochemical reaction in a transient manner, suggesting that unstable compounds such as reactive oxygen or nitrogen species might be responsible for the growth inhibition. Reporter assays in R. eutropha H 16 showed that sodC and norA promoters, which drives the genes for O 2 &# 8722; and NO defense pathway, respectively, were induced when electricity was on. To circumvent this toxicity problem, a porous ceramic cup was used to <b>shield</b> the <b>anode.</b> This inexpensive <b>shield</b> provides a tortuous diffusion path for chemicals. Therefore, the reactive compounds produced by the anode may be quenched before reaching the cells growing outside the cup. Using this approach, healthy growth of Ralstonia strains and production of over 140 mg/l biofuels were achieved with the electricity and CO 2 as the sole source of energy and carbon, respectively...|$|R
