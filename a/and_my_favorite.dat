5|$|The Stork Club {{was also}} {{featured}} in several movies, including The Stork Club (1945), Executive Suite (1954), Artists and Models (1955), <b>and</b> <b>My</b> <b>Favorite</b> Year (1982). Billingsley received $100,000 {{for the use}} of the club's name in the 1945 film. In All About Eve (1950), the characters played by Bette Davis, Gary Merrill, Anne Baxter and George Sanders are shown in the Cub Room of the Stork Club. The Alfred Hitchcock film The Wrong Man (1957) starred Henry Fonda as real-life Stork Club bassist Christopher Emanuel Balestrero ("Manny"), who was falsely accused of committing robberies around New York City. Scenes involving Balestrero playing the bass were actually shot at the club. The film's screenplay, written by Maxwell Anderson, was based on a true story originally published in Life.|$|E
25|$|Ball {{began working}} as a free-lancer in films and also began to explore other venues. Before and during World War II, Lucy had made several notable and {{successful}} guest appearances on several radio programs, among them Jack Haley's radio show and bandleader Kay Kyser's radio program. These appearances brought Lucy {{to the attention of}} CBS, which in 1948 enlisted Ball to star in one of two new half-hour situation comedies in development, Our Miss Brooks <b>and</b> <b>My</b> <b>Favorite</b> Husband. Choosing the latter, Lucy portrayed Liz Cugat (later anglicized to Cooper), the frustrated and scheming housewife of a Minneapolis banker, played originally by actor Lee Bowman in the series pilot, and later by actor Richard Denning. Based on the novel Mr. and Mrs. Cugat by Isabel Scott Rorick, My Favorite Husband was produced by Jess Oppenheimer, and written by Oppenheimer, plus scribes Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll, Jr.. Premiering on July 23, 1948 and sponsored by General Foods, Husband became a hit for CBS. During the run of the radio program Lucy appeared in two feature films with Bob Hope, Sorrowful Jones in 1949, and Fancy Pants in 1950. Both films were box office and critical successes, further cementing Ball's reputation as a top notch first-rate comedian. They also showed her continuing popularity with audiences, enticing CBS to further use her skills.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely mixed. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "a great monster story, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> of what I've seen of [...] so far." [...] He argued that the episode was [...] "so effective" [...] because it [...] "isn't just the inversion of the monster/normal personal dichotomy; the show has pulled that trick before, and while it tries to play coy about {{the true nature of}} the soul eater at first, it's not hard to recognize who the real villain is." [...] Handlen also wrote that the episode both [...] "forces the audience to identify more strongly with Doggett" [...] and made good use of Anderson's absence. Meghan Deans of Tor.com felt that, while [...] "the tale of the soul eater may have been a little rushed and a little sloppy", the episode itself [...] "has a spark to it [...] spark of the absent, the drive of the missing. The feeling that we’re all here for a reason, and that the show wants to live." ...|$|E

[...] With plans to return to the University of Michigan in the fall to complete a degree in history, Boros' traveling library during the 1961 season included The History of Russia, Survey of Russia, and Greek and Roman History. Boros told reporter Joe Falls, [...] "I never read just to be entertained.

Examples include automotive journalist Rob Rothwell, who wrote [...] "...when I first espied the rear lines of the Chrysler Crossfire I was instantly transported back to 1965 <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> car of that year, the Rambler Marlin." [...] Automotive editor to The Detroit News described the [...] "distinctive boat-tail rear end that reminds more than one observer of the old Rambler Marlin." [...] Motor Trend also compared the [...] "provocative boattail theme" [...] of the 2004 Crossfire's sheetmetal to that of the AMC Marlin. Even the handling characteristics of the Crossfire were compared by one British journalist to [...] "a detuned 1967 AMC Marlin with locked-solid suspension." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the late}} 1930s and early 1940s, Kyser's band {{appeared}} in several motion pictures, usually as themselves, {{beginning with the}} successful That's Right - You're Wrong (1939), You'll Find Out (1940), Playmates <b>and</b> <b>My</b> <b>Favorite</b> Spy. Some of the films built a plot around the band. Around the World (1943) fictionalized the band's international tours of military camps, and Swing Fever of 1943 supposed that Kyser was blessed with a hypnotic eye. [...] In Carolina Blues (1944), Kyser has to replace his lead singer (Carroll) who has run off to get married. Caught in a jam, he reluctantly hires {{the daughter of a}} powerful defense plant owner, played by Ann Miller. Two of the band's best-known performance appearances were in 1943 when they appeared in the wartime films Stage Door Canteen and Thousands Cheer, both of which were produced to boost the morale of troops and their families.|$|E

Queen described the platinum re-release as a [...] "double record". She explained that [...] "one of them is a CD with six new tracks and others themes," [...] while the second is a DVD [...] "where you can see pictures and music videos, and you can hear my family talking about me and who I am.

In the course of the sermon, (there was no sign of any MS., or reading from notes,) some of the parts would be in the highest degree majestic and picturesque.

I will say that he was always overrated, and that now he is lamentably falling off even from what he has been. I will back the Member for Stoke Poges against him; and show that the dashing young Member for Islington is a far sounder man than either. Have I any little {{literary}} animosities? Of course not. Men of letters never have. Otherwise, how I could serve out a competitor here, make a face over his works, and show that this would-be port is very meagre ordinaire indeed! Nonsense, man! Why so squeamish? Do they spare YOU! Now you have the whip in your hand, won't you lay on? You used to be a pretty whip enough as a young man, and liked it too. Is there no enemy who would be the better for a little thonging? No. I have militated in former times, not without glory; but I grow peaceable as I grow old.
