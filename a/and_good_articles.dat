40|$|Is man capax Dei? Zofia J. Zdybicka answers this {{question}} {{drawing on the}} entire tradition of classical philosophy which culminates in St. Thomas Aquinas. She considers the problem from the perspective of: (1) man who transcends the precariousness of human nature by his specific capabilities (intellectual knowing, loving, ability to freedom and religion); (2) faculties of the human soul (reason and will) which condition man’s disposition to knowing and loving God; (3) the metaphisical necessity for God to exist as the Supreme Truth <b>and</b> <b>Good.</b> The <b>article</b> concludes with threefold thesis. First, man is capax Dei because—within his capabilities which make him go beyond the entire world of beings (cosmos) —he {{is open to the}} Supreme Truth <b>and</b> Supreme <b>Good.</b> Secondly, man is capax Dei because—through his soul’s faculties fittingly developed (recta ratio and recta voluntas) —he can succeed in cognizing and loving God.

40|$|One way {{to learn}} how to write an {{academic}} article is by analyzing some <b>good</b> <b>and</b> effective <b>articles</b> and taking lessons from them. In this way, I have chosen two articles from two different political positions, i. e. “The End of History” by Francis Fukuyama from the Right and “Modernity, Unfinished/Incomplete Project” by Jürgen Habermas from the Left. The prime {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a translation and summary of Fukuyama’s article and the second objective is to analyze the text for extracting some theses, assumptions, research questions, etc. and finally is to compare these lessons with those that I have learned from analyzing the Habermas’s article (that I have published in a philosophical academic journal “Hekmat Va Falsafeh”). The author shows how these experiences can provide some criteria for writing academic articles and evaluating them. As we see in this paper, identifying a radical thesis, supporting it with convincing evidence and reasons and making a contribution to the body of knowledge, is the most characteristic feature of a <b>good</b> <b>and</b> academic <b>article.</b> Furthermore, we show that how two articles can be used as interdisciplinary methods for developing themes and ideas in a discourse. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the article is to point outsome {{relations}} between beauty <b>and</b> <b>good</b> in contemporary reality. The main question that arises here is as follows: is the relationship of beauty <b>and</b> moral <b>good</b> still relevant? The concept presented in the thesis refers to the ancient idea of kalokagathia. It stated that beauty is inseparable from moral good. As far as this ancient perspective is concerned, it can be treated as the background for contemporary considerations about {{the main issue of}} beauty <b>and</b> <b>good.</b> The <b>article</b> refers to the concept of aestheticization by Wolfgang Welsch. He defines aesthetics as the primary guiding value, where as experience and entertainment have become the guidelines for contemporary culture. Moreover, the thesis mentions the concept of the consumer society and new ethics of the relation to the body as it is described by Jean Budrillard. Then the narration of the article focuses on the following problem: in what sense can we talk nowadays about moral motivation for beauty treatments of body? One assumption leads to the case of looking after one’s body. Another point of view mentions the need of harmony which manifests itself in beautiful body. Eventually, the central question emerges whether contemporary practice of beautifying the body can {{be a part of the}} concept of the good life or not. 411311447 Filozofia Publiczna i Edukacja Demokratyczn...|$|R
