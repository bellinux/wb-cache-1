40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} auctioning long-term gas contracts in Colombia. I propose an annual auction for long-term firm gas contracts. The auction would assign and price all firm gas contracts, {{with the exception of}} gas from the Guajira field, which is assigned administratively at a regulated price. The proposal is a partial market design in that it does not address the transportation of gas from producer to consumer. The goal of the approach is to improve the transparency and efficiency of the gas market with a coordinated auction for long-term gas contracts. Currently, gas contracts are sold in a fragmented bilateral market. There are no standard contracts and little price transparency. A coordinated auction for standard contracts will reduce transaction costs and improve price formation. An annual auction for firm gas contracts with one to five-year duration allows both sides of the market to manage risks. Efficient price formation {{is one of the most}} important objectives of the gas auction. The simultaneous <b>ascending</b> <b>clock</b> <b>auction</b> is ideally suited to promote efficient price formation. The <b>ascending</b> <b>clock</b> <b>auction</b> provides excellent price discovery and enables demanders to freely arbitrage across the products. This assures that any price difference among products is a reflection of value differences. My view is that the coordinated auction proposed here will significantly improve the market for firm gas contracts. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{prospect}} of using auctions to resolve conflicts among parties {{competing for the}} same top-level internet domains is described. In the auctions investigated, the winner’s payment is divided among the losers. For first-price and second-price sealed-bid auctions, we characterize equilibrium bidding strategies and provide examples, assuming bidders ’ valuations are distributed independently and are either symmetrically or asymmetrically distributed. The qualitative properties of equilibria reveal novel features; for example, in a second-price auction a bidder might bid more than her valuation in order to drive up the winner’s payment. Even so, examples indicate that in symmetric cases a bidder’s expected profit is {{the same in the}} two auction formats. We then test in the experimental lab two auction formats that extent the setting from a single domain to the actual setting with many domains. The first format is a sequential first-price sealed-bid auction; the second format is a simultaneous <b>ascending</b> <b>clock</b> <b>auction.</b> The framing and subjects were chosen to closely match the actual setting. Subjects were PhD students at the University of Maryland with training in game theory and auction theory. Each subject played the role of an actual company (e. g., Google) and bid for domains (e. g.,. book) consistent with the company’s applications. Subjects were given instructions explaining the auction and the equilibrium theory for the single-item case in relevant examples. Both formats achieved auction efficiencies of 98 % in the lab. This high level of efficiency is especially remarkable in the case with asymmetric distributions—the format performed better than the simple single-item equilibrium despite the presence of budget constraints in the lab. This experiment together with previous results on the robustness of ascending auctions in general and simultaneous ascending clock auctions in particular suggest that the simultaneous <b>ascending</b> <b>clock</b> <b>auction</b> will perform best in this setting. ...|$|E

40|$|The European Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) {{has chosen}} to adopt an {{auctioning}} procedure to initially allocate CO 2 emission permits. Free allocation of permits becomes an exception for the third phase (2013 - 2020) and firms have to buy all their permits on the market or via auctions.

To counter the bidding ring, the auction can be open to bidders without compliance obligations (speculators). This paper aims at studying experimentally speculation as a collusion breaking device in two different auction mechanisms: the uniform price sealed bid auction and the <b>ascending</b> <b>clock</b> <b>auction.</b> Our results suggest that a uniform sealed bid auction open to speculators should be chosen from a revenue maximization point of view. In this mechanism, compliance agents are adopting an outbidding strategy toward speculators. This strategy significantly increases the seller’s revenue, compared to the more collusive clock auction. In this one, on the contrary, bidders accommodate speculators, letting them buy permits in the auction and buying their necessary permits on the secondary market. However, as opening the auction to speculators deteriorates efficiency, the regulator faces a trade-off between these two objectives...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper studies {{negative}} externalities’e¤ect on bidding {{strategy and}} auction outcome. We use {{a model of}} one special bidder and two regular bidders, where if the special bidder wins, both regular bidders incur a loss; otherwise, the two losing bidders receive zero payo¤s. Applying the model to an <b>ascending</b> <b>clock</b> <b>auction,</b> regular bidders are shown to bid less aggressively and drop out before reaching their private values. A regular bidder may have to bid above his value {{in order to win}} against the special bidder and thus risks negative pro…t by bidding aggressively. Since both regular bidders avoid the externality if either wins, there is a free riding incentive to drop out early; once one of the regular bidders drops out, however, the remaining one bids aggressively. Despite free riding, the item is ex post e ¢ ciently assigned in most cases. In contrast, in …rst-price sealed bid auctions free riding and aggressive bidding incentives are simultaneous, so ex post e ¢ ciency is less frequent. Using experiments to test the theory, our results suggest that bidders more often exhibit aggressive bidding rather than free riding in an ascending clock auction; furthermore, we show that in …rst-price sealed bid auctions, regular bidders bid more aggressively than the special bidder, indicating aggressive bidding incentives dominate free riding incentives...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—How to {{efficiently}} and fairly allocate data rate among different users {{is a key}} problem {{in the field of}} multiuser multimedia communication. However, most of the existing optimization-based methods, such as minimizing the weighted sum of the distortions or maximizing the weighted sum of the peak signal-to-noise ratios (PSNRs), have their weights heuristically determined. Moreover, those approaches mainly focus on the efficiency issue while there is no notion of fairness. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a game-theoretic framework, in which the utility/payoff function of each user/player is jointly determined by the characteristics of the transmitted video sequence and the allocated bit-rate. We show that a unique Nash equilibrium (NE), which is proportionally fair in terms of both utility and PSNR, can be obtained, according to which the controller can {{efficiently and}} fairly allocate the available network bandwidth to the users. Moreover, we propose a distributed cheat-proof rate allocation scheme for the users to converge to the optimal NE using alternative <b>ascending</b> <b>clock</b> <b>auction.</b> We also show that the traditional optimization-based approach that maximizes the weighted sum of the PSNRs is a special case of the game-theoretic framework with the utility function defined as an exponential function of PSNR. Finally, we show several experimental results on real video data to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.

40|$|Chapter 1 : Efficient Design of an Auction with Discrete Bid Levels This paper studies one of auction design issues: {{the choice}} of bid levels. Full {{efficiency}} is generally unachievable with a discrete auction. Since {{there may be more}} than one bidder who submits the same bid, the auction cannot completely sort bidders by valuation. In effort to maximize efficiency, the social planner tries to choose the partition rule-a rule dictating how type space is partitioned to group bidders who submit the same bid together-to maximize efficiency. With the efficient partition rule, we implement bid levels with sealed-bid and <b>clock</b> <b>auctions.</b> We find that the efficient bid levels in the sealed-bid second-price auction may be non-unique and efficient bid increments in a <b>clock</b> <b>auction</b> with highest-rejected bid may be decreasing. We also show that revealing demand is efficiency-enhancing even in the independent private valuation setting where price discovery is not important. Chapter 2 : Pricing Rule in a <b>Clock</b> <b>Auction</b> We analyze a discrete <b>clock</b> <b>auction</b> with lowest-accepted bid (LAB) pricing and provisional winners, as adopted by India for its 3 G spectrum auction. In a perfect Bayesian equilibrium, the provisional winner shades her bid while provisional losers do not. Such differential shading leads to inefficiency. An auction with highest-rejected bid (HRB) pricing and exit bids is strategically simple, has no bid shading, and is fully efficient. In addition, it has higher revenues than the LAB auction, assuming profit maximizing bidders. The bid shading in the LAB auction exposes a bidder to the possibility of losing the auction at a price below the bidder's value. Thus, a fear of losing at profitable prices may cause bidders in the LAB auction to bid more aggressively than predicted assuming profit-maximizing bidders. We extend the model by adding an anticipated loser's regret to the payoff function. Revenue from the LAB auction yields higher expected revenue than the HRB auction when bidders' fear of losing at profitable prices is sufficiently strong. This would provide one explanation why India, with an expressed objective of revenue maximization, adopted the LAB auction for its upcoming 3 G spectrum auction, rather than the seemingly superior HRB auction.

Finally, for markets that require real-time fast solution techniques, we propose a time sensitive fair Grid (tsfGRID) heuristic.
