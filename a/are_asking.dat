5|$|No, if we {{make this}} screen machine that you <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> for, it will spoil everything. We are making these peep show {{machines}} and selling {{a lot of them}} at a good profit. If we put out a screen machine there will be a use for maybe about ten of them in the whole United States. With that many screen machines you could show the pictures to everybody in the country—and then it would be done. Let's not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of animal studies also exclude females or fail to account for differences in sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E
5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E

The petitioners include Public Citizen, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, and San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace.|$|E
25|$|A very {{different}} reason for Kol Nidre was {{suggested by the}} Zohar; God has already threatened and vowed terrible punishments upon the Jewish people for their sins, but by our own demonstration that we can unbind ourselves from vows using Kol Nidre we hope to persuade God to similarly annul His own vows of calamity. As stated in the Orot Sephardic mahzor: According to the holy Zohar, Kol Nidre is recited on Yom Kippur because, at times, the Heavenly judgment is handed down as an 'avowed decree' for which there can normally be no annulment. By reciting the Kol Nidre annulment of vows at this time, we <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> of God that He favor us by annuling any negative decrees of judgment that await us, even though we are undeserving of such annulment.|$|E

25|$|The Reformed Churches (Liberated) are {{conservative}} in doctrine and practice. They {{do not allow}} women to hold special offices (elders, deacons, pastors), but in the 1990s they did approve women voting in church elections. They reject so-called Higher Criticism of the Bible. Liturgically, they favour {{the use of the}} Genevan Psalter in their worship services, although in the last decade a number of classical hymns has also been approved for use in the worship service. In recent years evangelical influences have become stronger (e.g. a more contemporary style of the worship, including new songs and hymns and the use of a praise band). A minority of the members and ministers are questioning some traditional doctrines, and <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> for a different approach on issues like the ordination of women, homosexual relationships, etc. A large middle group, however, wants to hold on to classical Calvinism.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E
25|$|The unusual {{lifestyle}} and growth pattern of Kiryas Joel {{has led to}} litigation {{on a number of}} fronts. In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet that the Kiryas Joel school district, which covered only the village, was designed in violation of the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment, because the design accommodated one group on the basis of religious affiliation. Subsequently, the New York State Legislature established a similar school district in the village that has passed legal muster. Further litigation has resulted over what entity should pay for the education of children with disabilities in Kiryas Joel, and over whether the community's boys must ride buses driven by women. A case against the village is currently pending in federal district court; plaintiffs, who <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> for the village to be dissolved, say that Kiryas Joel is a theocracy whose existence violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, where local government leaders abuse the laws, such as those for tax-exempt status, zoning, and sanitation, to favor members of their own sect and persecute other Orthodox Jews. They also say that the leaders commit vote fraud by intimidating dissident voters and busing in non-residents.|$|E

Then, the user <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> to take the chair of their criticized self, and to imagine verbally responding to their inner critic. Subsequently, the user is prompted to conduct a dialogue between these two aspects of the self, the criticizer and the criticized. Following this, the user <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> to imagine themself as a compassionate observer of this dialogue, and finally the user <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> to reflect upon the experience.|$|R

500|$|Among {{the most}} popular areas for the vrijmarkt in Amsterdam is the Jordaan quarter, but the wide Apollolaan {{in front of the}} Hilton hotel in {{southern}} Amsterdam is gaining in popularity. [...] Children sell their cast-off toys or garments at the Vondelpark, also in southern Amsterdam, and in a spirit of fun passers-by often offer the young sellers more than they <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> for the goods. [...] Until 1996 the vrijmarkt began the evening before and continued for 24hours. [...] This was ended in the hope of gaining a pause in the celebrations so preparations could be made for the daytime activities. Utrecht, uniquely among Dutch municipalities, retains the overnight vrijmarkt.|$|E
500|$|The villagers of Glod, Romania, took {{legal action}} against the {{producers}} of Borat, complaining that they were lied to {{about the nature of}} the filming and they were portrayed as incestuous and ignorant.

[...] They <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> for $38 million in damages.

500|$|After {{two days}} of being {{available}} on YouTube, the video garnered 2.2 million views. Upon release, the music video for [...] "Dear Future Husband" [...] received negative reviews from critics, receiving criticism for gender stereotypes. Kelly Lawler of USA Today wrote, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} gender stereotypes. There is a very, very catchy melody", and compared the nature of the video to that of Taylor Swift's music video for [...] "Blank Space" [...] (2014). The video received accusations of sexism, and backlash from feminists. In a negative review of the video, Julia Shumway of State Press wrote, [...] "The video calls back to a romanticized version of the 1950s or '60s, featuring a yellow version of a little pink house, complete with gramophone and groovy colors". MTV News' Christina Garibaldi criticized the video, writing [...] "the video depicts Meghan going back to the 1950s, scrubbing floors and working hard in the kitchen". Trainor responded to the criticism of the video, saying, [...] "Just surprised the random places people <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> me if I was being sexist. But no, I don’t believe I was." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 28, 2005 the Schindlers filed a motion, {{asking for}} {{permission}} to attempt to provide Schiavo with [...] "Food and Water by Natural Means." [...] This second motion asked {{for permission to}} [...] "attempt to feed" [...] Schiavo by mouth. Judge Greer denied the second motion on March 8, saying [...] "it has become clear that the second motion {{is part and parcel}} of the previous motion on medical evaluations. The same declarations are being used for both motions and the motion appears to be an alternative pleading to the previous motion. Both <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> for an experimental procedure." [...] The following day, Greer denied the first motion as well, citing that an affiant doctor for Michael cautioned that fMRI was an experimental procedure that should be conducted in an academic setting, because Schiavo had already undergone swallowing tests and failed, and because VitalStim had only been performed on patients who were not in a PVS. Greer noted that [...] "most of the doctor affidavits submitted are based on their understanding of Schiavo's condition from news reports or video clips they have seen. Many are obviously not aware of the medical exams undertaken for the 2002 trial." ...|$|E
