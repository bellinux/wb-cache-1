In humans there are no defined lithium deficiency diseases, but low lithium intakes from water supplies were associated with increased rates of suicides, homicides and the arrest rates for drug use and other crimes. The biochemical mechanisms of action of lithium appear to be multifactorial and are intercorrelated with the functions of several enzymes, hormones <b>and</b> <b>vitamins,</b> {{as well as with}} growth and transforming factors. Evidence now appears to be sufficient to accept lithium as essential; a provisional RDA of 1,000µg/day is suggested for a 70kg adult.|$|E
5|$|Scientists also {{view the}} ability to grow very long hair {{as a result of}} sexual selection, since long and healthy hair is a sign of {{fertility}} and youth. An evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health, signifying a woman's reproductive potential. As hair grows slowly, long hair may reveal 2–3 years of a person's health status, nutrition, age and reproductive fitness. Malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals <b>and</b> <b>vitamins</b> due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in hair color (e.g. dark hair turning reddish).|$|E
5|$|Mould fungi are {{the source}} of the meaty (umami) flavour of the soybean {{products}} tempeh, miso and soy sauce. Tempeh has been produced in Java since the 13th century. Like tofu, it is made into protein-rich blocks, but these have a firm texture and earthy flavour, since (unlike tofu) the whole beans are retained, providing a higher content of dietary fibre <b>and</b> <b>vitamins.</b> Miso too is rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. It is fermented from a mixture of soybeans and cereals, forming a soft paste used to flavour soups and other Japanese dishes. Soy sauce has been used in China since the 2nd century AD, and is now widespread in Asia. Like miso, it is made by fermenting a mixture of soybeans and cereals with moulds such as Aspergillus oryzae.|$|E

5|$|On October5, a {{national}} disaster was declared for Jamaica {{due to the}} effects of Nicole. In response, the USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided US$50,000 for the purchase and delivery of relief supplies and fuel for emergency vehicles. About J$4million (US$46,800) was donated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the Greenhouse Growers Association for the repair of greenhouses. In conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization, an estimated J$12million (US$140,400) was made available to initiate the planting of about 50,000 crop seedlings. The Veterinary Division provided financial assistance to livestock farmers and dispatched animal technicians with prophylactic medication <b>and</b> <b>vitamins</b> to avert foot rot disease in small ruminants, including goats and sheep. The cost of the medications was estimated at J$2million (US$23,400). The Banana Board's Catastrophe Fund, which at the time comprised J$50million (US$585,000), delivered both monetary support and human resources to local banana and plantain farmers.|$|E
5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} is taken by {{commercial}} fisheries operating throughout its range, including off Pakistan, India, Thailand, and the Philippines; an exception is in Australian waters, where it is only taken in small numbers as bycatch. This shark is caught using demersal trawls, floating and fixed bottom gill nets, and on hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted, the fins are used for shark fin soup, and the offal processed into fishmeal. In addition, the liver {{is a source of}} oil <b>and</b> <b>vitamins,</b> and the thick, tough skin is made into leather products. Off Queensland, Australia, the {{tawny nurse shark}} is valued by big-game anglers. When hooked, large individuals are tenacious opponents and are difficult to subdue due to their habit of spinning. They are also capable of spitting a powerful jet of water into the faces of their captors, making grunting noises in between jets (making the tawny shark one of the few species of sharks to produce a noise);whether this is a deliberate defensive behavior is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are herbivores, grazing {{mainly on}} grasses and aquatic plants, {{as well as}} fruit and tree bark. They are very {{selective}} feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat {{a greater variety of}} plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season. Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so are not consumed at that time. The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side. Capybaras are autocoprophagous, meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein <b>and</b> <b>vitamins</b> from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle. As is the case with other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses; their cheek teeth also grow continuously.|$|E

40|$|Various {{formulations}} of selenium <b>and</b> <b>vitamin</b> E, both essential human dietary components, {{have been shown}} to possess a therapeutic and preventive effect against prostate cancer. Fortuitous results of clinical trials also implied a risk-reduction effect of selenium <b>and</b> <b>vitamin</b> E supplements. The Selenium <b>and</b> <b>Vitamin</b> E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), using oral selenium <b>and</b> <b>vitamin</b> E supplementation in disease-free volunteers, was designed to test a prostate cancer chemoprevention hypothesis. SELECT was terminated early because of both safety concerns and negative data for the formulations and doses given. Here, we review and discuss the studies done before and since the inception of SELECT, as well as the parameters of the trial itself. We {{believe that there is a}} lack of appropriate in vivo preclinical studies on selenium <b>and</b> <b>vitamin</b> E despite many promising in vitro studies on these agents.

25|$|A {{side effect}} of the heating of {{pasteurization}} is that some <b>vitamin</b> <b>and</b> mineral content is lost. Soluble calcium and phosphorus decrease by 5%, thiamin <b>and</b> <b>vitamin</b> B12 by 10%, <b>and</b> <b>vitamin</b> C by 20%. Because losses are small {{in comparison to the}} large amount of the two B-vitamins present, milk continues to provide significant amounts of thiamin <b>and</b> <b>vitamin</b> B12. The loss of vitamin C is not nutritionally significant, as milk is not an important dietary source of vitamin C.|$|R
25|$|Fiber {{does not}} bind to {{minerals}} <b>and</b> <b>vitamins</b> and therefore does not restrict their absorption, but rather evidence exists that fermentable fiber sources improve absorption of minerals, especially calcium.

40|$|SummaryPopulation {{aging and}} {{osteoporosis}} are global public health challenges. Osteoporosis markedly {{increases the risk}} of fractures, and further morbidity and mortality. Calcium is a major constituent of the bone <b>and</b> <b>vitamin</b> D helps maintain calcium homeostasis. Calcium <b>and</b> <b>vitamin</b> D supplements have long been recognized as the cornerstones for prevention and management of osteoporosis and fractures. Although the associations between calcium <b>and</b> <b>vitamin</b> D supplementation <b>and</b> bone mineral density, fracture prevention, and potential adverse outcomes from available evidence are inconsistent, the Institute of Medicine Committee and the American Geriatrics Society support a key role of calcium <b>and</b> <b>vitamin</b> D in skeletal health. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that calcium with or without vitamin D supplementation {{increases the risk of}} cardiovascular events and cancer. Older adults should obtain at least 1000  IU/day of vitamin D with 1000 – 1200  mg/day of calcium {{to reduce the risk of}} fractures. The actual supplementation levels of calcium <b>and</b> <b>vitamin</b> D should be advised individually to specific patient or situation...|$|R
