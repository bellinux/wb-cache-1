6000|$|If I {{spent two}} nights at Nantes, {{it was for}} reasons of {{convenience}} rather than of sentiment; though indeed I spent them in a big circular room which had a stately, lofty, last-century look--a look that consoled me a little for the whole place being dirty. The high, old-fashioned inn (it had a huge windy porte-cochère, and you climbed a vast black stone staircase to get to your room) looked out on a dull square, surrounded with other tall houses and occupied on one side by the theatre, a pompous building decorated with columns and statues of the muses. Nantes belongs to the class of towns which are always spoken of as [...] "fine," [...] and its position {{near the mouth of}} the Loire gives it, I believe, much commercial movement. It is a spacious, rather regular city, looking, in the parts that I traversed, neither very fresh nor very venerable. It derives its principal character from the handsome quays on the Loire, which <b>are</b> <b>overhung</b> with tall eighteenth-century houses (very numerous too in the other streets)--houses with big entresols marked by arched windows, classic pediments, balcony-rails of fine old iron-work. These features exist in still better form at Bordeaux; but, putting Bordeaux aside, Nantes is quite architectural. The view up and down the quays has the cool, neutral tone of colour that one finds so often in French water-side places--the bright greyness which is the tone of French landscape art. The whole city has rather a grand, or at least an eminently well-established, air. During a day passed in it of course I had {{time to go to the}} Musée; the more so that I have a weakness for provincial museums--a sentiment that depends but little on the quality of the collection. The pictures may be bad, but the place is often curious; and indeed from bad pictures, in certain moods of the mind, there is a degree of entertainment to be derived. If they are tolerably old they are often touching; but they must have a relative antiquity, for I confess I can do nothing with works of art of which the badness is of recent origin. The cool, still, empty chambers in which indifferent collections are apt to be preserved, the red brick tiles, the diffused light, the musty odour, the mementos around you of dead fashions, the snuffy custodian in a black skull-cap, who pulls aside a faded curtain to show you the lustreless gem of the museum--these things have a mild historical quality, and the sallow canvases after all illustrate something. Many of those in the museum of Nantes illustrate the taste of a successful warrior, having been bequeathed to the city by Napoleon's marshal Clarke (created Duc de Feltre). In addition to these there is the usual number of specimens of the contemporary French school, culled from the annual Salons and presented to the museum by the State. Wherever the traveller goes, in France, he is reminded of this very honourable practice--the purchase by the Government of a certain number of [...] "pictures of the year," [...] which are presently distributed in the provinces. Governments succeed each other and bid for success by different devices; but the [...] "patronage of art" [...] is a plank, as we should say here, in every platform. The works of art are often ill-selected--there is an official taste which you immediately recognise--but the custom is essentially liberal, and a Government which should neglect it would be felt to be painfully common. The only thing in this particular Musée that I remember is a fine portrait of a woman by Ingres--very flat and Chinese, but with an interest of line and a great deal of style.|$|E

50|$|There {{are five}} long, often branched, rays {{attached}} round {{the edge of}} the tegmen. Each of these is further subdivided into branchlets (the pinnules). Most comatulids originally have 10 arms, each ray being subdivided once. The arms are fragile, and if one is broken off, at least two grow in its place; in this way the number of arms can increase. The arms are composed of articulating ossicles held together by ligaments, and the pinnules have a similar structure. The arms are very flexible and can be spread widely or coiled up. An ambulacral groove starts on each pinnule and joins with others to form grooves on the arms all leading to grooves on the tegmen ending at the mouth. These food-collecting grooves <b>are</b> <b>overhung</b> by calcareous plates (the lappets) and have a lining of fine cilia.|$|E
50|$|In 1910, {{lacking the}} means to achieve before 1906 the {{paintings}} provided by the architect Gaspard André, Louis Rivier offered a monumental decoration for the Palais de Rumine. In 1914 Jean-Jacques Mercier offered to finance the artist {{for the duration of}} the work; Rivier participated in the decoration of his Château Mercier in Sierre in 1907. The work of l'Aula began in 1915, which would last until 1923 and represented 1,000 square meters of paint. The style Rivier chose was in harmony historicist architecture of the palace and the destination of l'Aula. The mural combines science, art, and religion in the service of uplifting humanity, and a religious character consistent with the outcome of the Reformation. But the work of Rivier expresses an ambivalent feeling towards science which to certain details of the work, we note that it is rather subject to theology which he matches, in a very medieval vision from their reports. The sides which are represented by twelve allegorical figures of faculties <b>are</b> <b>overhung</b> by an entire vault dedicated to religion. On April 21, 1923, the newly transformed l'aula was the setting for the Conférence de Lausanne sur le Moyen-Orient (Lausanne Conference on the Middle East).|$|E
50|$|This temple is the {{earliest}} surviving {{example of the}} Dravida style in Early Chalukya architecture. It consists of a sanctuary, without passageway, opening into a triple aisled mandapa. Walls of sanctuary and mandapa have a curved course and a central recessed portion, divided into panels, some filled with gana musicians, dancers and warriors. The mandapa walls have three projections on the north and south, among which the middle one accommodates panels portraying Shiva (south) and Vishnu (north). Each god {{is accompanied by a}} pair of diminutive companions. The mandapa walls, beside the porch, have a corner pilastered projection and a single niche containing a swaying dvarapala. The sanctuary and mandapa walls <b>are</b> <b>overhung</b> by continuous kapota eaves on a frieze of ganas. Two recessed moldings support a parapet, with a set of corner kutas and central shalas over the mandapa walls, and a similar, kuta-shala-kuta parapet over the sanctuary walls. There is a tower rising over the sanctuary, above which rises the octagon-to-dome roof, exactly like that of upper Shivalaya, but without amalaka finial.The mandapa interior has a central east-west aisle, defined by raised floor strips linking the free-standing and engaged columns. Two additional columns define a small bay in front of the sanctuary doorway. Transverse beams carried on open-mouthed makara brackets carry the raised and horizontal roof slabs, with vishnu on flying Garuda carved onto the central bay. The sanctuary doorway is framed by jambs, including those with serpent bodies culminating in a flying Garuda over the lintel, with male and female figures beneath at either side. A linga on a pedestal, perhaps replacing a sculpted icon, is seen within the sanctuary.|$|E

40|$|A new {{solution}} of disc permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) directly driven wheel is proposed as a design customized for low floor tramcar. And the motors <b>are</b> <b>overhung</b> on the bogie frame {{to make the}} weight as the sprung mass. Meanwhile, the universal coupling is installed between the driven wheel and motor shaft. A disc PMSM is designed according to the demand of traction power. The motors are not only traction and steering actuators but are also regarded as sensors to obtain the rotational speed of motor directly driven wheel. Through the obtained data, an active sensorless steering control method is applied using the relative rotational speed between wheel pair. Finally, models combined with motor control and steering control are set up to check the control strategies. The simulation results indicate that sliding mode observer has the functionality of estimating the rotating speed with high accuracy for active steering control. The tramcar exhibits self-steering and better negotiation under active steering control. The tramcar is under a better condition of running along the central line of track with small attack angle and low power consumption while passing the shape curve track...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} how terrestrial {{laser scanning}} (TLS) and terrestrial digital photogrammetry {{were used to}} create a 3 D model of a steep mountain wall. Terrestrial methods of data acquisition are the most suitable for such relief, as the most effective registration is perpendicular to the surface. First, various aspects of photo-based scanning and laser scanning were discussed. The general overview of both technologies was followed by the description of a case study of the western wall of the Kościelec Mountain (2155 m). The case study area {{is one of the most}} interesting and popular rock climbing areas in the Polish High Tatra Mts. The wall is about 300 meters high, has varied relief and some parts <b>are</b> <b>overhung.</b> Triangular irregular mesh was chosen to represent the true- 3 D surface with its complicated relief. To achieve a more smooth result for visualization NURBS curves and surfaces were utilized. Both 3 D models were then compared to the standard DTM of the Tatra Mountains in TIN format, obtained from aerial photographs (0. 2 m ground pixel size). The results showed that both TLS and terrestrial photogrammetry had similar accuracy and level of detail and could effectively supplement very high resolution DTMs of the mountain areas...|$|E
40|$|Many cartographers {{are making}} an effort to depict mountainous steep relief on {{classical}} maps. There are many techniques that enable achieving this goal effectively. However nowadays we notice a trend toward 3 D realistic representation of relief, using Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from aerial photographs or satellite imagery. They are very useful and sufficient for visualizing and modeling various terrain features - from flat to hilly. Nevertheless the mountainous terrain is very problematic, as very steep slopes cannot be seen and depicted from bird'. That is why an alternative method should be used to gather information and visualize terrain with vertical relief, otherwise information about such areas is omitted or very poor (Butler et al. 1998; Gooch et al. 1999; Buchroithner 2002; Mergili 2007). The aper resents ossible pplication of close-range photogrammetry for mapping and visualization of steep (close to vertical) rock walls. In this way integration of photogrammetry, digital cartography and photorealism meets the needs of information systems for climbers and tourism in general. Technology and software is similar to that being used in aerial photogrammetry, but some differences in concept should be considered in order to generate spatial model in horizontal projection, so called quasi-DEM. The research object is a part of natural climbing wall situated in Krakow, Poland. The surface is approximately vertical, with some parts which <b>are</b> <b>overhung.</b> It is also very rough, so many shades appear. For the creation of quasi-DEM, quasi-orthophoto and virtual rock face, 4 overlapping photographs were taken with Nikon D 80 amateur digital camera. Object distance was about 5. 5 m, and ground resolution about 1. 8 mm. The camera was previously calibrated with ImageMaster software by Topcon and known parameters of the camera lens allowed the removal of the distortion from the images. ERDAS LPS (Leica Photogrammetry Suite) was used to perform photogrammetric processing. In order to demonstrate the potential of the technique, some steps used by climbers are marked, and anaglyphic methods facilitate a three dimensional perception. That can help inexperienced climbers to plan their route and prepare for the real experience...|$|E
