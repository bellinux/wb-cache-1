5|$|The {{directorship}} of Neil MacGregor saw a major rehang at the Gallery, {{dispensing with}} {{the classification of}} paintings by national school that had been introduced by Eastlake. The new chronological hang sought to emphasise the interaction between cultures rather than fixed national characteristics, reflecting the change in <b>art</b> <b>historical</b> values since the 19th century. In other respects, however, Victorian tastes were rehabilitated: the building's interiors were no longer considered an embarrassment and were restored, and in 1999 the Gallery accepted a bequest of 26 Italian Baroque paintings from Sir Denis Mahon. Earlier in the 20th century many considered the Baroque to be beyond the pale: in 1945 the Gallery's trustees declined to buy a Guercino from Mahon's collection for £200. The same painting was valued at £4million in 2003. Mahon's bequest was made {{on the condition that}} the Gallery would never deaccession any of its paintings or charge for admission.|$|E

25|$|From an <b>art</b> <b>historical</b> perspective, the {{depiction}} of the Immaculate Conception involves a number of interesting issues.

25|$|Activities of {{scientists}} and collectors {{beginning in the late}} 19th century have substantially increased the corpus of surviving Oriental carpets, allowing for more detailed comparison of existing carpets with their painted counterparts. Western comparative research resulted in an ever more detailed cultural history of the Oriental art of carpet weaving. This has in turn renewed and inspired the scientific interest in their countries of origin. Comparative research based on Renaissance paintings and carpets preserved in museums and collections continues to contribute to the expanding body of <b>art</b> <b>historical</b> and cultural knowledge.|$|E

25|$|The art of Peter Paul Rubens may {{possibly}} {{depict the}} effects of RA. In his later paintings, his rendered hands show, {{in the opinion of}} some physicians, increasing deformity consistent with the symptoms of the disease. RA appears to some to have been depicted in 16th-century paintings. However, it is generally recognized in <b>art</b> <b>historical</b> circles that the painting of hands in the 16th and 17th century followed certain stylized conventions, most clearly seen in the Mannerist movement. It was conventional, for instance, to show the upheld right hand of Christ in what now appears a deformed posture. These conventions are easily misinterpreted as portrayals of disease.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of Oriental carpets, however, {{continue to be}} depicted as objects with visual appeal, without political connotations, but ignoring their original cultural context. It was reserved to a later century to try and reach out for {{a better understanding of}} the carpets within their Islamic cultural context. Whilst Islamic carpets initially served to adorn Renaissance paintings, later on the paintings contributed to {{a better understanding of the}} carpets. Comparative <b>art</b> <b>historical</b> research on Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting thus adds another facette, and leads to a better understanding of the highly multifaceted, and sometimes ambivalent, image of the Ottomans during the Western European Renaissance.|$|E

It is the only remaining illustrated Sephardic Haggadah in the world. The National Museum also hosts year-round exhibitions pertaining to local, regional and international culture and history, and exhibits over 5,000 artefacts from Bosnia's history.|$|E
25|$|In Christian art, {{the hand}} of God has {{traditionally}} been understood as an artistic metaphor that {{is not intended to}} indicate that the deity was physically present or seen in any subject depicted. In the late antique and early medieval periods, the representation of the full-bodied figure of God the Father would have been considered a grave violation of the Second Commandment. According to conventional <b>art</b> <b>historical</b> interpretation, the representation of {{the hand of}} God in early Christian art thus developed as a necessary and symbolic compromise to the highly anti-anthropomorphic tenor of the Second Commandment, though anthropomorphic interpretations are certainly plausible. In early Christian and Byzantine art, the hand of God is seen appearing from above in a fairly restricted number of narrative contexts, often in a blessing gesture, but sometimes performing an action. Gertrud Schiller distinguishes three functions of the hand in Christian art: as symbol of either God's presence or the voice of God, or signifying God's acceptance of a sacrifice. In later Christian works it tends {{to be replaced by a}} fully realized figure of God the Father, whose depiction had become acceptable in Western Christianity, although not in Eastern Orthodox or Jewish art.|$|E

500|$|Myers, in contrast, {{relying on}} a more {{traditional}} <b>art</b> <b>historical</b> interpretation of the image, reads it more positively. She agrees that the children's hats resemble halos but she identifies Mrs. Mason's position {{as one of a}} [...] "protective cruciform", evoking a [...] "heroic, even Christlike ... female mentorial tradition". Myers views Mrs. Mason as a sacrificial hero rather than as an oppressive adult who cannot see the glories of nature.|$|E
500|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the image upon the viewer is attributed to what E. B. Goldstein has called the 'differential rotation effect.' Because of this effect, Kitchener's eyes and his foreshortened arm and hand appear to follow the viewer regardless of the viewer's orientation to the artwork. Historian Carlo Ginzburg compared Leete's image of Kitchener to similar images of Christ and Alexander the Great as depicting the viewer's contact with a powerful figure. Pearl James commented on Ginzburg's analysis agreeing that {{the strength of the}} connotation lies with a clever use of discursive psychology and that <b>art</b> <b>historical</b> methods better illuminate why this image has such resonance. The capitalized word [...] "YOU" [...] grabs the reader, bringing them directly to Kitchener's message. The textual focus on [...] "you" [...] engages the reader about their own participation in the war. Nicholas Hiley differs in that Leete's portrayal of Kitchener is less about immediate recruiting statistics but the myth that has grown around the image, including ironic parodies. Leete's Kitchener poster caught the attention of a then eleven-year-old George Orwell, who may have used as it the basis for his description of the [...] "Big Brother" [...] posters in his novel 1984.|$|E
