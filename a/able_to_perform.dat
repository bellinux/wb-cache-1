Inspection robots using other types of sensors have been considered before, such as the European project Robair.

Technicians are usually <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> {{a wide range}} of emergency care skills, such as defibrillation, spinal immobilization, bleeding control, splinting of suspected fractures, assisting the patient with certain medications, and oxygen therapy.

The space which is freed up after the TRIM command may be at random locations spread throughout the SSD.

5|$|Numerous {{case studies}} of brain damage have shown that damage to {{areas of the brain}} (such as the {{anterior}} prefrontal cortex) results in the reduction or elimination of inhibitions, with a corresponding radical change in behaviour. When the damage occurs to adults, they may still be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> moral reasoning; but when it occurs to children, they may never develop that ability.|$|E
5|$|Other {{experiments}} {{were conducted by}} Pieter Zeeman in 1914–1915. Using a scaled-up version of Michelson's apparatus connected directly to Amsterdam's main water conduit, Zeeman was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> extended measurements using monochromatic light ranging from violet (4358 Å) through red (6870 Å) to confirm Lorentz's modified coefficient.|$|E

50|$|Domo's {{hands were}} {{designed}} to be dexterous and capable of many different grasps and movements. However, this cannot be accomplished without {{the design of the}} software system to be adept at managing different controllers for each of its joints. This allows the robot <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> react quickly and change its arm activity. This is critical for the robot <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> attempt <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> real world tasks.|$|R

Additionally, PICUP was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>performed</b> at physiological pH of 7.4, which opened doors for further {{application of}} protein cross-linking such as studying the biochemical mechanisms that proteins participate in the human body. In addition, irradiation by visible light in PICUP is useful because many biomolecules that participate in metabolic pathways to be analyzed do no absorb light with wavelengths below the range for UV light, allowing for cross-links without denaturation.|$|R
