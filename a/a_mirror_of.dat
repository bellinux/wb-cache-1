25|$|There {{are several}} lines of interpretation, often blended to some extent, {{to define the}} Mafia: it has been viewed as <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>of</b> {{traditional}} Sicilian society; as an enterprise or type of criminal industry; as {{a more or less}} centralized secret society; and as a juridical ordering that is parallel to that of the state – a kind of anti-state.

25|$|Like {{both his}} brothers, Edward Frederic Benson ("Fred") and Arthur Christopher Benson, Robert wrote many ghost and horror stories, {{as well as}} children's stories and {{historical}} fiction. His horror and ghost fiction are collected in The Light Invisible (1903) and <b>A</b> <b>Mirror</b> <b>of</b> Shallott (1907). His novel, Lord of the World (1907), is generally {{regarded as one of}} the first modern dystopian novels (see List of dystopian literature). The bibliography below reveals a prodigious output.|$|E
25|$|While his {{writings}} were directed largely to a literate class, it was nonetheless his assumption {{that they would}} be read aloud, as was common during the Middle Ages. He is ever conscious of propriety, and speaks carefully, both because of his elevated rank, and in case women or children should hear what he has written. His works reflect his character, ambitions, and beliefs, so that in many ways they are <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>of</b> his time and circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The Australians {{replied with}} an {{impressive}} 447 driven by 4 half-centuries amongst their top six batsmen, and {{the fourth time in}} the series that they had done so. England's second innings was <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>of</b> the first, all out {{on the morning of the}} fifth day for 264, leaving the Australians with half a day to pick up the 78 runs required for victory, and the Ashes. A dogged not out century to wicket-keeper Jack Russell had delayed the inevitable, but when David Boon swept Nick Cook towards the square leg fence in the 32nd over of Australia's innings, the tourists passed the required mark and gained victory by 9 wickets, regaining the Ashes which England had held since 1985.|$|E

25|$|Various historiographers {{note that}} the concept of dreamed world precedes the German school by several generations, finding its {{literary}} expression in Calderón de la Barca's 1635 allegory, before arriving at Gautier. Eminescu's own perception of spacetime, as apparent in the story and in some poems (La steaua, for instance), has intrigued Romanian students of physics, particularly after they became aware of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. In 1928, Einstein received a letter from his Romanian admirer, Melania Șerbu, who informed him that Poor Dionis had anticipated his finds; Einstein kept corresponding with Șerbu, but did not show an interest in reading the story. In addition to investigating such connections herself, critic Ioana Em. Petrescu believed that the modern interest of Poor Dionis, and of Eminescu's work in general, was given by its multiple levels, and especially by its hermeneutic suggestions. In her view, Zoroaster's book is <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>of</b> the world symbol, as in the deconstruction terminology coined by Jacques Derrida.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle was}} preceded by the attack on British-controlled Calcutta by Nawab Siraj-ud-daulah and the Black Hole massacre. The British sent {{reinforcements}} under Colonel Robert Clive and Admiral Charles Watson from Madras to Bengal and recaptured Calcutta. Clive then seized the initiative to capture the French fort of Chandernagar. Tensions and suspicions between Siraj-ud-daulah and the British culminated in the Battle of Plassey. The battle was waged during the Seven Years' War (1756–63), and, in <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>of</b> their European rivalry, the French East India Company (La Compagnie des Indes Orientales) sent a small contingent {{to fight against the}} British. Siraj-ud-Daulah had a numerically superior force and made his stand at Plassey. The British, worried about being outnumbered, formed a conspiracy with Siraj-ud-Daulah's demoted army chief Mir Jafar, along with others such as Yar Lutuf Khan, Jagat Seths (Mahtab Chand and Swarup Chand), Omichund and Rai Durlabh. Mir Jafar, Rai Durlabh and Yar Lutuf Khan thus assembled their troops near the battlefield but made no move to actually join the battle. Siraj-ud-Daulah's army with 50,000 soldiers, 40 cannons and 10 war elephants was defeated by 3,000 soldiers of Col. Robert Clive, owing to the flight of Siraj-ud-daulah from the battlefield and the inactivity of the conspirators. The battle was ended in 11 hours.|$|E
25|$|The Green Sun Princes {{are made}} with the fifty Essences of Solar Exalts which the Yozis took in payment from the Neverborn and altered to emulate {{themselves}} in exchange for teaching the Neverborn to corrupt Solar Essences to create the Abyssals. While the first edition hinted at their existence, they did not get official rules until 2nd edition's Manual of Exalted Power - The Infernals (April 2009). The Green Sun Princes were created by a cadre of five of the Yozis; Malfeas, She Who Lives In Her Name, Cecylene, Adorjan, and the Ebon Dragon. Each of these Yozis {{is responsible for the}} creation of one caste of Green Sun Princes and the charms associated with that caste, Malfeas created the Slayers, Cecylene created the Malefactors, She Who Lives in Her Name created the Defilers, Adorjan created the Scourges and the Ebon Dragon created the Fiends. Green Sun Princes of any caste can learn the charms of all five castes, as well as the charms of any other Yozis who have opened up access to their charms to the Green Sun Princes; in the default setting, Kimbery is the only other Yozi who has done so. The Yozis have tasked the Green Sun Princes with transforming Creation into <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>of</b> Malfeas, which they believe will break their bonds and reverse their disfiguring imprisonment. They call this effort the Reclamation.|$|E

500|$|The Posthumous Works, {{of which}} The Wrongs of Woman {{was the largest}} part, had a [...] "reasonably wide audience" [...] when it was {{published}} in 1798, but it [...] "was received by critics with almost universal disfavor". This was in large part because the simultaneous release of Godwin's Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman revealed Wollstonecraft's illegitimate child and her love affairs. Most reviewers and readers transferred the unconventional and unorthodox life Wollstonecraft herself had lived onto Maria and much that Maria had said and done onto Wollstonecraft, thereby realizing Wollstonecraft's fears that her books would be read only as <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>of</b> her life.
