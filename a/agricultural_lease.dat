40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper was to answer the {{question}} whether the legal regulations ensure an agricultural producer (lessee) sufficient stability in terms of farming, namely in terms of running a stable agricultural activity. According to the author of this article, this stability consists of two elements: ensuring the agricultural producer continuity of possession and enjoyment of the profits as well as guaranteeing manufacturing capacity of the subject of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>lease.</b> The article presents, among other things, the assessment of the influence of legal solutions included in Act of 16 September 2011 on changing Act on the management of agricultural property of the State Treasury on stability of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>lease.</b> It also analyzes questions relating to lease of private land and lease of land from the units of local governments. Moreover, the article focuses on the instruments protecting the manufacturing capacity of the subject of the lease, including EU regulations that make the obtaining of financial support subject to meeting numerous requirements concerning the treatments and maintaining good agricultural condition. The article also concentrates on the issues of amendments and improvements. In the final part of the article the author has stated that research has confirmed that the legal regulations do not protect farming on leased agricultural land in a sufficient way. The current legal regulations on agricultural land lease do not correspond to the requirements of present situation in Poland.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper {{is an attempt to}} answer the {{following}} questions: firstly, is the pledge an available and favourable form o f securing receivables related to agricultural production due from a debtor who is an agricultural producer, and, secondly, is the pledge an effective measure of obtaining the benefit for the creditor. Three types of pledges have been analysed: an ordinary pledge regulated by articles 306 - 335 of the civil code, a registered pledge and a statutory pledge related to the <b>agricultural</b> <b>lease</b> (article 701 civil code). The paper presents different issues related to the pledge, including the pledge being a subject and object o f the transaction, and the recovery o f the benefit secured by the pledge. The paper ends with a conclusion that from the point o f view o f both: the pledgor and the pledgee, a registered pledge is undoubtedly a much more advantageous and desirable form of securing receivables than an ordinary pledge. Consequently, postulates requesting modifications of some existing regulations concerning registered pledge act seem to be fully justifiable...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{identify}} the legal problems concerning agricultural land transactions and management as well as to try to solve these problems, namely to formulate de lege ferenda conclusions. First of all, the discussion focuses on the issues relating to a sub–lease of agricultural land in the context of the pre–emption right and getting the EU financial aid. Next, the paper indicates the problems concerning the pre–emption right that the lessees of municipal land have and the possibility these entities have to use tax preferences to enlarge their farms. Subsequently, the article presents the issue of building works on agricultural land which is part of the farm, especially the works done by individual farmers. The author, presenting the above problems, has tried to put forward de lege ferenda proposals, for instance granting the pre–emption right to a sub–lessee, granting tax preferences to lessees of municipal and private land in the case of enlarging the farms and the freedom to build family farms on agricultural land.

40|$|Land lease {{is one of}} the few {{possible}} ways to use {{the agricultural}} land effectively. This is caused by problems in the proprietary and user relationships, therefore the <b>agricultural</b> land <b>lease</b> and its legal regulation is especially important for Slovakia. This paper deals with the selected legal arrangements related to the <b>agricultural</b> land <b>lease</b> in Slovakia with an objective to identify application problems faced by lessees and lessors of agricultural land. When regulating the <b>agricultural</b> land <b>lease</b> relationships, the Slovak law maker prefers dispositive legal norms. However, this method is rarely used in the application practice. Contracting parties often focus only on obligatory characters of the contract, relying on the legal text of dispositive provisions. The legal arrangement of the lessee’s prior right to sign the new lease contract attracts a particular attention. Current legal regulation of this lessee’s right seems to be unenforceable; on the other hand, it collides with the basic human rights. This provision needs to be either cancelled or adjusted so that it achieves the objective defined by the law maker and so that it is legally enforceable in compliance with superior legal norms...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the current}} debate on land leases in Fiji. It argues that the recent positions taken {{by the government and}} the opposition will not lead to a satisfactory solution. It could be argued that the government and the opposition are posturing for the election by taking positions that are diametrically opposed. The erosion of preferential prices for sugar and the declining production in the agricultural sector is going to further reduce the demand for agricultural land leases and this could lead to more land being left idle. In addition, the declining rural population and the resulting decline in demand for land could further reduce the rental income of the landowners. This is likely to have an adverse impact on the living conditions of the landowners as many depend on rental incomes for their livelihoods. The lack of resolution of the impasse over the <b>agricultural</b> <b>lease</b> has promoted instability in the country and a permanent solution would {{have a positive impact on}} agricultural productivity and indirectly on investment and the whole economy. The recent proposal by Labour Party MP and prominent academic, Dr. Ganesh Chand, supported by the Asian Development Bank report on the Fiji Economy, is a way forward which promises to provide a permanent solution to the agricultural land lease problem in Fiji. The proposal calls for the state to lease all agricultural land from the NLTB and sub-lease it to the tenants. This would satisfy both the tenants who will have certainty of land leases and the Great Council of Chiefs and NLTB who wall all land to be leased under the NLTA...|$|E

An economic model of leases in which absentee tenants may or may not intend to breach shows that the primary benefit of the traditional rule is to promote tenant investment in the property by discouraging landlord entry. In contrast, the advantage of the modern rule is to prevent the property from being left idle by encouraging landlords to enter and re-let abandoned property.

40|$|The <b>leasing</b> {{market for}} <b>agricultural</b> land is {{significant}} in Nebraska. This {{study was conducted}} to evaluate <b>agricultural</b> <b>leasing</b> arrangements and the relationships these arrangements have upon land use management and conservation practices. The results provide a comprehensive benchmark of the cropland leasing market and its participants and provides substantial insight into issues of stewardship on leased land. ^ An estimated 44 percent of the total farms in Nebraska is leased. Share and cash leases dominate the market but cash leases are gaining in popularity. The cropland market relatively local market in nature, is a comparably stable and informal market, and still it is relatively complex market. ^ Results of this study reveal that <b>agricultural</b> <b>leases</b> are generally economically efficient and equitable. Within the sub-state areas, predominant share arrangements exist which are influenced by crops grown, the presence of irrigation, perceived yield variability, and general preference patterns and customs of both landowners and tenants. ^ The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation was used to predict soil loss on leased tracts in Nebraska and South Dakota. These results suggest that agricultural producers appear to be stewarding the land they operate, regardless of ownership status, in an environmentally conscientious manner. Tenant respondents in this study indicated that environmental interests and conservation practices on land they own and land they lease are essentially one in the same. ^ Respondent tenants perceive community norms and social pressures to farm leased land as they would their own. Reputations and perceptions of individual tenants matter. This, coupled with their own beliefs and values concerning production agriculture and long-term resource management is reflected their production practices. ^ These findings suggest that government-sponsored conservation programs do not necessarily need to tied to program participation but rather with a more positive attitude of partnering with producers who already have conscientious stewardship practices in mind. Public education may be the key to managing agricultural land resources for the societal good. ...|$|R
25|$|During {{the first}} years after {{independence}} in 1964, Banda and the governing Malawi Congress Party actively supported the smallholder farming sector, as few European-owned estates remained. Disappointing smallholder production {{and the development of}} a policy of growing Burley tobacco on estates caused the government to transfer land to the estate sector. In 1966, Banda argued that customary land tenure was insecure and inhibited investment. A Customary Land Development Act in 1967 allowed the creation of <b>agricultural</b> <b>leases</b> of up to 99 years over Customary Land. Many estates in the Central Region growing Burley tobacco were controlled by Banda and senior officials and politicians. Land alienation speeded up in the 1970s; however the process differed from that of the early colonial period as most new estates were medium-sized farms and not in the scale of former European-owned estates. This still represented the transfer of land from smallholders to a better off elite.|$|R
40|$|Little {{research}} has been conducted on the restructuring activities of tenant farmers in response to changing tenancy legislation and recent CAP reforms. This paper examines the geography of farm tenancy agreements in England since 1995 and presents some findings from postal and telephone surveys on the possible future business trajectories of tenant farmers and the changing nature of landlord-tenant relationships. A clear north-south divide is identified in terms of farm tenancy agreements and a complex array of different tenancy agreements is demonstrated. The relationships between landlords and tenants are changing and the increasing variety of agreements provides evidence of a more fluid (post-feudal) system of <b>agricultural</b> <b>leases.</b> Nevertheless, high levels of uncertainty and negativity characterise tenant farmers' views on the impacts of CAP reforms. Crucially, the very identity of a tenant farmer is changing, towards an owner-occupier who rents additional land, and there is an urgent need for more detailed research on the 'consequential geographies' of farm property rights and the changing nature of landlord-tenant relationships...|$|R
