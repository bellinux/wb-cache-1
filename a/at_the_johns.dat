5|$|Numerous etiologies of {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{have been}} described. Pneumomediastinum was first {{recognized as a}} medical entity by Laennec, who reported it {{as a consequence of}} trauma in 1819. Later, in 1939, <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins Hospital, Dr. Louis Hamman described it in postpartum woman; indeed, subcutaneous emphysema is sometimes known as Hamman's syndrome. However, in some medical circles, it can instead be more commonly known as Macklin's Syndrome after L. Macklin, in 1939, and M.T. and C.C. Macklin, in 1944, who cumulatively went on to describe the pathophysiology in more detail.|$|E
5|$|Scientists <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory {{think that}} Voyager 1 entered the {{termination}} shock in February 2003. This marks {{the point where}} the solar wind slows down to subsonic speeds. Some other scientists expressed doubt, discussed in the journal Nature of November 6, 2003. The issue would not be resolved until other data became available, since Voyager 1s solar-wind detector ceased functioning in 1990. This failure meant that termination shock detection would have to be inferred from the data from the other instruments on board.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Edwin Herbert Hall working <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins University {{discovered}} a voltage developing across conductors transverse to an electric current in the conductor and magnetic field {{perpendicular to the}} current. This phenomenon arising {{due to the nature}} of charge carriers in the conductor came to be termed the Hall effect, but it was not properly explained at the time, since the electron was experimentally discovered 18 years later. After the advent of quantum mechanics, Lev Landau in 1930 developed the theory of landau quantization and laid the foundation for the theoretical explanation for the quantum Hall effect discovered half a century later.|$|E

5|$|In 1926 Harold Knight {{spent several}} months <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, in America, {{painting}} portrait commissions of surgeons. Laura joined him there {{and was given}} permission to paint at the Baltimore Children's Hospital and in the black wards of the racially segregated Johns Hopkins Hospital. Whilst in Baltimore Knight painted a nurse, Pearl Johnson, who took her to meetings and concerts of the early American civil rights movement. Knight also hired a mother and child model to pose for the composition originally known as the Madonna of the Cotton Fields. Knight took these paintings back to London with her and they feature in the Pathé newsreel produced to mark her election as an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1927. Another portrait of Johnson, Irene and Pearl, shows two women {{against a backdrop of}} skyscrapers and was {{one of a number of}} portraits Knight painted in the late 1920s that appear strikingly modern. Miss Ealand, shown at the Royal Academy in 1928, depicts a woman with cropped hair wearing a jacket and holding a gun. The same year Knight's portrait of a women saxophone player was displayed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC.|$|E
