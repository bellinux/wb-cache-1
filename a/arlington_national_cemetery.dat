50|$|Clark Construction of Bethesda, Maryland, {{was hired}} to be the general {{contractor}} for the Women in Military Service for America Memorial. The New York firm Lehrer, McGovern Bovis oversaw construction management. Clark subcontracted excavation work to Kalos Construction Co. Clark had recently renovated <b>Arlington</b> <b>National</b> <b>Cemetery's</b> Memorial Amphitheater, and had experience working under the restrictions required by the cemetery. A construction manager was required because the site was small, there was little room for construction equipment or offices, {{and access to the}} site was highly limited. Because both pile driving and excavation would be conducted, extreme care was needed to avoid disturbing any of the graves near the memorial site.|$|R

5000|$|Meigs made {{additional}} {{major changes}} to the cemetery in the 1870s. In 1870, he ordered that a [...] "Sylvan Hall"—a series of three cruciform tree plantings, one inside the other—be planted in the [...] "Field of the Dead" [...] (in what is now Section 13). A year later, Meigs ordered the McClellan Gate constructed. Located {{just west of the}} intersection of what is today McClellan and Eisenhower Drives, this was originally <b>Arlington</b> <b>National</b> <b>Cemetery's</b> main gate. Built of red sandstone and red brick, the name [...] "MCCLELLAN" [...] tops the simple rectangular gate in gilt letters. But just below the name was inscribed the name [...] "MEIGS"—a tribute to himself which Meigs could not help making. Due to the growing importance of the cemetery as well as the much larger crowds attending Memorial Day observances, Meigs also decided a formal meeting space at the cemetery was needed. A grove of trees southwest of Arlington House was cut down, and an amphitheater (today known as the Tanner Amphitheater) was constructed in 1874. Meigs himself designed the amphitheater.|$|R
