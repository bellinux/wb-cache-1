[...] McGrath praised Ricks for pointing out connections between Dylan's work and other poets and cultural figures that are [...] "surprising and provocative. At various points he compares Mr. Dylan to Marvell, Marlowe, Keats, Tennyson, Hardy, Yeats and Marlon Brando, to cite {{just a few of}} his references." [...] McGrath goes on to suggest that some passages in Dylan's Visions of Sin may strike some readers as over the top, as when Mr. Ricks devotes four pages (and four footnotes) to the lyrics of [...] "All the Tired Horses," [...] a song that is only two lines long—or maybe three, if you count the long [...] "hmmmm" [...] at the end. Other chapters, though, draw insightful and persuasive parallels between, say, [...] "Lay Lady Lay" [...] and John Donne's poem [...] "To His Mistress Going to Bed," [...] between [...] "Not Dark Yet" [...] and Keats's [...] "Ode to a Nightingale," [...] and between [...] "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall" [...] and the Scottish ballad [...] "Lord Randal." ...|$|E

Tolerance analysis {{plays an}} important role in the stage of product design and has great influences on the product assembly quality and manufacturing costs.

Through the comparison of these two methods on the computation processes and the results, this paper validates the effectiveness of these two methods and analyzes their applicative condition for functional tolerance analysis...|$|E

This paper compares two methods of tolerance analysis of a mechanical system: the method of "analysis lines" and the method of "polytopes". The first method needs a discretization of the ending functional surface according to various <b>analysis</b> <b>lines</b> placed on the outer-bound of the face and oriented along the normal of the surface. The second method uses polytopes. The polytopes are defined from the acceptable limits of the geometric deviations of parts and possible displacements between two parts.
