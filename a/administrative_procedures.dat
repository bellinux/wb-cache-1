40|$|On January 1 st, 2006, the act no. 500 / 2004 Coll., <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code (hereinafter "New <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code") {{has come}} into effect, {{replacing}} the act no. 71 / 1967 Coll., on <b>administrative</b> proceedings (<b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code) (hereinafter "Old <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code"). The New <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code came with {{a broad range of}} new legal institutes and altered many others. The purpose of this thesis is to place the New <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code and the Old <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> side by side to compare them with one another and to attempt to evaluate the contribution of the New <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code to the Czech legal system.

25|$|The NLRB recognizes {{a breach}} of the duty of fair {{representation}} {{as a violation of}} the National Labor Relations Act. However, because the duty of fair representation was originally created by judicial interpretation, rather than as an express statutory prohibition, employees covered by the National Labor Relations Act may sue their unions directly, without being required to first exhaust any <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures</b> provided under the National Labor Relations Board. The same is true for workers covered by the Railway Labor Act, which does not provide any administrative procedure for pursuing claims against a union. Employees' claims under either Act are governed by a six-month statute of limitations.|$|E

25|$|Montana District Courts are {{the state}} trial courts of general {{jurisdiction}} in the U.S. state of Montana. Montana District Courts have original jurisdiction over most civil cases (at law and in equity), civil actions involving monetary claims against the state, criminal felony cases, naturalization proceedings, probate cases, and most writs. They may also hear certain special actions and proceedings, and oversee a narrowly-defined class of ballot issues. Montana District Courts also have limited appellate jurisdiction regarding cases {{that arise in}} Justice Courts, City Courts, and Municipal Courts (Courts of Limited Jurisdiction) as well as Judicial review of decisions by state administrative law tribunals that fall under the Montana <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedures</b> Act.|$|E
25|$|The NLRB and {{the courts}} provide {{different}} solutions against unions that breached their duty of fair representation. Because the Board does not usually have the jurisdiction to enforce {{the collective bargaining agreement}} or to issue a remedial order against an employer that has violated it, the NLRB often cannot award complete relief to employees. A court, on the other hand, may order an employer to reinstate or pay back pay to an employee if it finds that the employer violated the collective bargaining agreement and may, in some instances, order the union to pay attorneys' fees to a successful plaintiff. These distinctions do not apply to workers covered by the Railway Labor Act since, as noted above, they have no <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures</b> to enforce their rights.|$|E

Since the announcement, however, the club's efforts to get the stadium off the ground has been hindered mainly due to slow <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures,</b> political interests and various opposition groups, who view the stadium as financially, ecologically and socially wrong for the taxpayers and community of Décines. The project is currently on hold, but most estimate that the stadium will be completed by 2015. The official name of the stadium will be The Stade des Lumières.|$|E

25|$|Decollectivization obviated the {{supervisory}} functions of low-level cadres, {{who no longer}} needed to oversee work on the collective fields. Some cadres became full-time administrators in township offices, and others {{took advantage of the}} reforms by establishing specialized production households or by leasing collective property at favorable rates. Former cadres, with their networks of connections and familiarity with <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures,</b> were in a better position than ordinary farmers {{to take advantage of the}} opportunities offered by the growth of markets and commercial activity. Even those cadres not wholly devoted to increasing their own families' income found that to serve their fellow villagers as expected it was necessary to act as entrepreneurs.

25|$|Each housing {{cooperative}} {{has their own}} bylaws. The members hold annual meetings in the {{housing cooperative}}, in which they elect {{a board of directors}} that take on the responsibility of managing the cooperation during the upcoming year. In most normal-sized cooperatives the board members are recruited among the inhabitants. The board sets the monthly fee, secures proper <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures,</b> keeps the property in good condition, and may initiate large renovation projects when necessary. The board is also involved when a member sells his apartment (i.e. sells his right to inhabit the apartment) to someone else, as the board has to make decisions on allowing the exit of old members and the entry of new members. If the buyer of a bostadsrätt is found financially viable, the board has no right to turn down a membership application. The board is also involved when individual members want to initiate large renovation projects, or when individual members want to rent out the apartment to a non-member.|$|E
25|$|A red-light {{perspective}} of administrative law embodies deep-rooted suspicion of governmental {{power and a}} desire to minimize the encroachment of the state on the rights of individuals. This envisions the courts being locked in an adversarial or combative relationship with the Executive and functioning as a check on administrative power. Where a green-light perspective is concerned, the focus is not so much on actively resisting administrative bodies as a form of negative control (as in the red-light perspective), but instead raising areas where public bodies may improve their various <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures.</b> This approach is derived from the utilitarian tradition, and the priority in achieving the greatest good for the greatest number is to encourage the contribution of the state through means of egalitarian and ameliorative social reform so as to deliver communitarian goals. Thus, the red-light perspective is more conservative and control-oriented, while the green-light perspective is more liberal or socialist in orientation and facilitative in nature.|$|E
40|$|The {{decision}} of an administrative body under <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> Code, the Code of Administrative Justice and in judgments of administrative court This thesis concerns {{the topic of}} the {{decision of}} an administrative body under <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> Code, the Code of Administrative Justice and in judgments of administrative courts. The aim of the thesis is to describe the basic features of the decision under <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> Code and the decision under Code of Administrative Justice, their legal definition, conception and relation to the other results of activity of public administration, their division and other characteristics. Such analysis is supposed to serve for comparison of both institutes in order to draw a conclusion about their mutual conformity, resemblance and difference and because of that also their correlation. The thesis is composed of three chapters. Chapter one defines administrative act, as concept that is universal, blanket and determinative for decision of an administrative body under <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> Code and also under the Code of Administrative Justice and therefore using specification of administrative act is possible to specify also common components of concept decision. Chapter two successively focuses on the decision under <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Garrison also {{remained}} {{active in}} areas {{outside the law}} after the 1945. From 1947 to 1952 he served as President of the National Urban League. He {{was a close friend}} of Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson, and strongly supported Stevenson's campaigns for President of the United States in 1952 and 1956. From 1958 to 1961, Garrison worked closely with Eleanor Roosevelt, Thomas Finletter, and Herbert H. Lehman to break the power of Tammany Hall-backed politician Carmine DeSapio in New York City politics. The efforts of Garrison and the other finally broke Tammany Hall's grip on the city for good: Ed Koch defeated De Sapio by 41 votes in 1963 and by 164 votes in a rematch in 1964, and De Sapio's political career ended. Garrison was a long-time member of the American Civil Liberties Union, and served on its board of directors from the late 1930s until at least 1965. Over the years, he was {{also a member of the}} board of trustees for Harvard University, Sarah Lawrence College, and Howard University. While serving on the Howard board, he helped write a report which significantly restructured the school's <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures.</b> He was also a long-time member of the Council of Foreign Relations and the New York City Bar Association.|$|E
