5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga, Tsukudani aimed to write scenes that {{were easy to}} read, {{something}} {{she felt she was}} unable to do well when the manga's serialization began. What she felt was most important was depicting the characters as cute as possible. When developing the characters, she based the female members of the student council and Tadokoro on friends she had in the drama club when she was a student. However, Hime was created from scratch using Tsukudani's ideals for a cross-dressing boy as a basis for the character including his pink hair, side pigtails, and him being forced to cross-dress. When developing the members of the public morals committee, Tsukudani had already decided on having a pair of cross-dressing brothers, which led to Kaguya's development. Tsukudani's editor suggested making Kaguya the protagonist of the spin-off manga Himegoto+, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> give Kaguya a partner, so she created No. 1 and thought she might as well make her into a cross-dressing girl. For Mitsunaga and Hiro, she wanted them to cross-dress due to some preconceived issue. Tsukudani was careful to design the characters to maintain a balance between them, including what hair color they would have.|$|E
25|$|Catherine held western European philosophies {{and culture}} {{close to her}} heart, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{surround}} herself with like-minded people within Russia. She believed a 'new kind of person' could be created by inculcating Russian children with European education. Catherine believed education could change {{the hearts and minds}} of the Russian people and turn them away from backwardness. This meant developing individuals both intellectually and morally, providing them knowledge and skills, and fostering a sense of civic responsibility.|$|E

When she was in school, she developed interest in science and mathematics. Her father fostered a culture of intellectual pursuit in her home. He enjoyed reading about science and filled the home with plenty of books on popular science. When she was in the sixth grade, a copy of The Double Helix (a book by James Watson) was presented to her by her father. When she was in the high school, she was influenced by Miss Wong, a chemistry teacher.|$|E

In {{the early stages of}} the campaign, a series of leaks were released by purported Labor Party sources, indicating apparent divisions within Cabinet over the replacement of Kevin Rudd by Gillard. Midway through the campaign, Gillard offered journalists a self-assessment of her campaign by saying that she had been paying too much attention to advisers in her strategy team, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> run a less [...] "stage-managed" [...] campaign: ...|$|E

The song also mentions pentagrams and the [...] "Google of the United States". According to Amy Pettifer, Madonna [...] "...reckons it's the beautiful freaks {{of the club}} that hold the power, not these celebrity cyphers; she's interested in the sweat-slicked celestial bodies, 'shining like illuminati'". In an interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna said she was often {{accused of being a}} member of the Illuminati <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> record a song about what she believed the Illuminati to be.

Mugford had lied about Bamber's confession, they said, because he had betrayed her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> stop him from being with anyone else. No one had seen Bamber cycle {{to and from the}} farm. There were no marks on him on the night that suggested he had been in a fight. No blood-stained clothing of his was recovered. He had not driven to the farm as quickly as he could have after his father telephoned because he was afraid. There was no probative value in the finding of a hacksaw in the garden, because Bamber had entered the house via the windows many times, before the killing and since.|$|E
500|$|A former {{dancer and}} fixture on the New York club scene, Madonna Louise Ciccone became {{known to the}} world simply as Madonna, {{with the release of}} her 1983 self-titled debut album Madonna. Fueled by hit songs like [...] "Holiday", [...] "Borderline" [...] and [...] "Lucky Star", the album {{was one of the best}} selling of the year and helped Madonna become one of the most {{exciting}} new artists of the 1980s. When she started work on her second album, Madonna felt that her first album had succeeded in introducing her [...] "street-smart dance queen" [...] persona, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> solidify and build upon that concept. According to her, [...] "My work, my dedication—the stubbornness for getting Madonna released—had paid off. Now it was time to solidify my future." ...|$|E
500|$|Thematically, Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone {{felt that}} the album focused on two subjects: {{listening}} to one's heart, and being a rebel. Madonna explained that these concepts were not the initial inspiration, but emerged during the sessions with Avicii. Madonna observed two distinct themes emerging organically, and {{felt the need to}} express them. The record was titled [...] Rebel Heart, since it dealt with two different aspects of the singer's character — her rebellious, renegade side, and her romantic side; she wanted the album to represent both. On the French radio station NRJ, she explained that Rebel Heart could be both autobiographical and fictional, since she mixed both her own experiences with imaginary narratives while writing the songs. The title also stemmed from Madonna's belief that contemporary music artists are not encouraged or inspired to be rebellious, take risks, or speak-up, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> highlight this. However, she understood the importance of having love in the rebellious nature, so added the word Heart to the title.|$|E

500|$|Elsewhere, Hermione Norris {{returns as}} Ros Myers. The {{character}} was initially written {{off after the}} eighth episode of the sixth series due to the actress's pregnancy, however when the seventh series entered pre-production, Norris was asked to return and she accepted. Miranda Raison also returns as Jo Portman; the cliffhanger of the sixth series finale, where Jo was apparently killed, was to leave the audience wonder whether she survived. Raison stated that she realised the producers wanted her to return, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> return. Alex Lanipekun returns as Ben Kaplan, and was upgraded to a series regular from the last series. Lanipekun believed that the seventh series was [...] "kind of for Ben," [...] adding {{that there was an}} episode that would see his coming of age by dealing with his first undercover operation and his burdens, namely getting close to someone who is involved with the group he was sent to stop. Peter Firth, Gemma Jones and Hugh Simon returns as superior Harry Pearce, Connie James and Malcolm Wynn-Jones, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Kellan Lutz was in Africa {{shooting}} the HBO miniseries Generation Kill when the auditions {{for the character}} of Emmett Cullen were conducted. The role had already been cast {{by the time that}} production ended in December 2007, but the actor who had been selected [...] "fell through"; Lutz subsequently auditioned and was flown to Oregon, where Hardwicke personally chose him. Rachelle Lefèvre was interested in pursuing a role in the film because Hardwicke was attached to the project as director; there was also [...] "the potential to explore a character, hopefully, over three films"; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> portray a vampire. She [...] "thought that vampires were basically the best metaphor for human anxiety and questions about being alive."

500|$|The stage used {{multimedia}} projection {{and technology}} conceived by Moment Factory and Cirque du Soleil. After Madonna's entrance, {{the ground and}} stage floor revealed animated Vogue magazine covers featuring the singer. The effect was achieved by projection mapping, which turns an object (often irregularly-shaped) into a surface for video projection. Although projection mapping {{had been used to}} introduce the Nokia Lumia and project images of NBA players on the Hudson River in 2011, it had never been used on such a large scale. Moment Factory partner and executive producer Eric Fournier said that since the studio had been associated with technology-dependent shows, preparing for and accommodating the requirements of the Super Bowl were easy. When Moment Factory began the halftime-show preparations, Madonna's team had already selected the songs, and the studio developed visual effects complementing the songs' choreography. According to Moment Factory creative director Sakchin Bessette, using video projections was the most efficient method for the visual effects, as this required moving less equipment to the field than other methods. Fournier said, [...] "It all came from the decision at the beginning to make a show out of it, not just a performance. Madonna's a perfectionist, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do something extraordinary, so that was the objective of everybody." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Together Again" [...] {{was written}} {{as a tribute}} from Jackson to {{a friend who had}} {{recently}} died from AIDS as well as AIDS victims and their families worldwide, as stated in the liner notes of The Velvet Rope (1997). Originally written as a ballad, the track was re-arranged as a dance and house song. Jackson was reportedly inspired to write the song from her own personal experience, as well as a piece of fan-mail she received from a young boy in England who had lost his father. According to Jimmy Jam, [...] "it had a deep meaning for her because it was about a friend she lost to AIDS, but as with all her songs, she tries to make them apply in a general sense to anybody. The idea was to make it a joyous song musically". The arrangement of the song was constructed in 30 minutes by Jam, Lewis, and Jackson while in the recording studio. Once the melody was in place, Jackson finished writing the lyrics to the song. The song's sound was inspired by Donna Summer's song [...] "Last Dance". Jackson told MTV News that her inspiration to write [...] "Together Again" [...] was [...] "Runaway" [...] by Nuyorican Soul, as the song reminded her of being in Studio 54 in New York when she was a child. [...] "Runaway" [...] gave Jackson a kind of New York feel of disco <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do something like this.|$|E
500|$|Feeling {{like her}} {{character}} was wasting her college degree O'Toole suggested to the producers that Martha {{go to work}} for Lex during the second season. The producers agreed, but altered the concept so that Martha went to work for Lionel, and that she would use this new position to spy on Lionel and find out what he knows about Clark. Disappointed when the storyline ended quickly into the second season, O'Toole hoped that the secret her character was holding in [...] "Ryan" [...] was that Martha was going to run for Mayor. In O'Toole's opinion, Martha needs some form of outlet for intelligence. To the chagrin of O'Toole, Martha's next storyline—the expectation of a new child—tied the character to the farm in a way the actress did not agree with. O'Toole wanted to perform as if the pregnancy was fake—something mentally created by Clark's ship—but the producers insisted that she wear the pregnancy pads to indicate that she was indeed pregnant. Ultimately, that storyline ended with Martha losing the baby to a miscarriage. Before season four began, O'Toole suggested again to the producers that Martha {{go to work for}} Lex. O'Toole had enjoyed the moments in the show when she was working for Lionel, because it gave her character something more to do, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do that again for season four. The producers took her suggestion and had Martha take a job at the Talon, which was owned by Lex, and which O'Toole felt allowed Martha to interact more with the other characters in Clark's life.|$|E
500|$|One day, Vivien hears {{crying in}} the {{basement}} and goes down to investigate where she finds an exhausted and stressed Nora (Lily Rabe), taking care of a baby. Vivien approaches a confused Nora who mistakes her for a nanny and demands she be called Mrs. Montgomery.

Nora recognizes Vivien and insults her for having a baby that won't stop crying to which Vivien defends the baby. Vivien asks for permission to hold him, to which Nora angrily refuses and proclaims the baby as hers as arrangements were made with which Vivien regretfully complies. Vivien offers help in calming her still crying son to which Nora finally agrees. Vivien calms her child almost immediately, Nora confesses she does not have the constitution to be a caring mother <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hurt the baby and leaves the baby to Vivien to get a [...] "good rest". Finally free of anyone trying to claim her child, [...] Vivien asks Moira to join their family as the baby's godmother, which she happily accepts. Vivien names their baby Jeffrey. Together, as one happy family, they all celebrate Christmas by decorating a tree in the abandoned house with various ornaments found in the attic.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the remix of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{was directed by}} Carey's husband, Nick Cannon. Minaj spoke about filming a video with Carey and how she {{did not believe that}} the video would ever be released: [...] "I didn’t even tell anyone I shot a video with Mariah, because I didn’t even believe. In the back of my mind, I felt like, ’This video is not gonna come out. There’s no way I’m gonna do a video with Mariah Carey before I even put out my album.’ Then, when it came out, I think it was the #1 video on YouTube in one day, something crazy like that." [...] It premiered simultaneously with the video for [...] "Angels Cry" [...] with Ne-Yo on Vevo on January 28, 2010. Carey and Minaj play different characters, include Barbie dolls who escape from their boxes, sexy nurses in matching outfits, two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping. Carey's doll box has [...] "She sings" [...] written on the front, while Minaj's say [...] "She raps". Cannon makes a cameo appearance in the video, which Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy thought was a reference to the 2002 film, Drumline. According to Anna Pickard of The Guardian, the escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and {{that they will not be}} restrained by men. Minaj spoke about the video in an interview for MTV News: [...] "A lot of times, more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they’ll never include you in that. I feel like she liked the whole doll thing <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do it with me. But she said that: She said, ’Everybody’s gonna say 'she’s doing Nicki.' But I told her, she’s always had a doll persona, like all that ’doll baby’ [...] So it goes perfect with Barbie and we had fun. That’s all that matters." ...|$|E
