500|$|Expressing honestly, in NVC, {{is likely}} to involve expressing an {{observation}}, feeling, need, and request. An observation may be omitted if {{the context of the}} conversation is clear. A feeling might be omitted if there is sufficient connection already, or the context is one where naming a feeling isn't likely to contribute to connection. It is said that naming a need in addition to a feeling makes it less likely that people will think you are making them responsible for your feeling. Similarly, it is said that making a request in addition to naming a need makes it less likely that people will infer a vague demand that they address your need. The components are thought to work together synergistically. According to NVC trainer Bob Wentworth, [...] "an observation sets the context, feelings support connection and getting out of our heads, needs support connection and identify what is important, and a request clarifies what sort of response you might enjoy. Using these components together minimizes the chances of people getting lost in potentially disconnecting speculation <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> from them and why." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{title of}} the album, No Sound Without Silence, is both a {{shortening}} of philosophical idea put forward by the band and a critical comment on the music industry.

The Script lead vocalist Danny O'Donoghue commented on the album's title, stating [...] "The time we've been away, we've had time to contemplate about what we want to say to the industry. There is no sound without silence. You can't have anything good to say if you don't think about it first".|$|E

It's funny because I feel like we all are interested in happiness, but I feel like very few of us sit down to actually see how much we're doing in our day lends to our happiness. It also seems like when you're a kid you have all these goals <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> your life to become.

Once we got that figured out, we just sat in the studio and did one thing, and that was we didn't argue - if a song was good then it was good. It didn't matter if it was Christian, Country, Pop…I think that’s one of the things that’s going to show through on this album once you listen to it.

The voice work. It was my first time working at the Weiss, to fill a 500 Seat Theater was a challenge, finding the right pitch and power for my voice to cut through was imperative.
