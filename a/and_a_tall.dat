5|$|The {{cruciform}} abbey {{is built}} of Bath stone, {{which gives the}} exterior its yellow colour. It is an atypical example of the Perpendicular form of Gothic architecture, with low aisles and nave arcades <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> clerestory. The walls and roofs are supported by buttresses and surmounted by battlements, pinnacles and pierced parapets, {{many of which were}} added by George Manners during his 1830's restorations.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{territory}} is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> ice wall stretches throughout its coast. In some areas further within the ice sheet, mountain ranges breach through the ice, allowing for birds to breed {{and the growth of}} a limited flora. The region is divided into the Princess Martha Coast, Princess Astrid Coast, Princess Ragnhild Coast, Prince Harald Coast and Prince Olav Coast. The waters off the coast are called the King Haakon VII Sea.|$|E
5|$|The BORAX Experiments were {{a series}} of {{destructive}} tests of boiling water reactors conducted by Argonne National Laboratory in Idaho. The BORAX-1 test was conducted under Zinn's supervision in 1954. He had the control rods removed {{to demonstrate that the}} reactor would shut down without trouble, and it immediately blew up with a loud bang <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> column of dark smoke, a turn of events that he had not anticipated. He shouted to Harold Lichtenberg to put the control rods back in again, but Lichtenberg pointed out that one was already flying through the air. Zinn later had to testify on the experiment before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.|$|E

5|$|The east front {{looks more}} medieval {{than the other}} sides but {{probably}} dates from about 1900, however the south end cross-wing appears to be mostly sixteenth century. To {{the north of the}} house stands the well-preserved sixteenth century stable courtyard. This has timbered gabled dormer windows, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> clock-tower at the west side of its north range. These buildings have mullion windows, and Tudor arched-doorways. Also beside the courtyard are the brew house, one of the oldest in Britain, and the bakehouse. The two lodges are seventeenth century and the carriage-houses are eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The islet in {{the left}} foreground, today known as Riddarholmen ("Knights' Islet"), was during the medieval era known as Gråmunkeholmen ("Greyfriars Islet") after the Franciscan monastery located there and in the {{painting}} represented as a building with stepped gables <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> turret {{at the far side}} of the islet. Together with other similar institutions, the monastery was closed by the king following the Reformation although the building was used as a hospital until the mid 16th century. The turret of the monastery was replaced by the cast iron spire of Riddarholm Church in the 19th century, but the remains of the monastery still exist inside the church and under the surrounding buildings.|$|E
5|$|The route {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{difficult}} in the modern history of the race, with substantial criticism that it was simply too hard for a three-week-long race. Of the seven stages categorized as 'high mountain', six had summit arrivals, highlighted by the three stages before the second rest day ending at Grossglockner in Austria, the exceptionally steep Monte Zoncolan, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> and steep peak near the Fascia Valley in Gardeccia. There was also, for the fifth consecutive Giro, a climbing time trial, this one to the Nevegal. Of the race's 18 mass-start stages, only three ended with the majority of the field together at the front of the race.|$|E

5|$|After much discussion, Harrison, who {{coordinated the}} meetings, {{determined}} that a design based on Niemeyer's project 32 and Le Corbusier's project 23 would be developed for the final project. Le Corbusier's project 23 consisted of a large block containing both the Assembly Hall and the Council Chambers {{near the center of}} the site with the Secretariat tower emerging as a slab from the south. Niemeyer's plan was closer to that actually constructed, with a distinctive General Assembly building, a long low horizontal block housing the other meeting rooms, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> tower for the Secretariat. The complex as built, however, repositioned Niemeyer's General Assembly building to the north of this tripartite composition. This plan included a public plaza as well.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century, Scotland's rapidly {{expanding}} economy and population resulted in the laying out of numerous new towns and remodelled settlements, resulting in a need for new churches to support the local residents. These included St Andrew's and St George's West Church, George Street, in the New Town of Edinburgh, designed by Andrew Frazer (1782–87), followed in the tradition of Gibbs, with an oval plan, tetrastyle Corinthian portico <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> steeple. The builder, Alexander Stevens, probably also designed the steeple of St Cuthbert's Church (1789–90). At Fochabers, from 1776 John Baxter redesigned the village on a grid plan, with a central square focused on Bellie Church (1795–97), still following in the tradition of Gibbs, with a tetrastyle portico and steeple.|$|E

50|$|The DeSoto {{engine was}} {{enlarged}} for 1956 to 329.9 cuin L. Bore {{was the same}} as the 291 at 3.72 in, but stroke was increased to 3.80 in <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>taller</b> (raised-deck) block was used.|$|R
25|$|After the {{recapture}} of Jerusalem in CE 132 {{the emperor}} Hadrian had the city rebuilt as a Roman city called Aelia Capitolina <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> pillar {{in the plaza}} inside the Damascus Gate was {{the starting point for}} measurements to other cities, as indicated in the mosaic Madaba Map. This pillar appears to have fallen or been demolished during the Byzantine period.|$|E
25|$|There are twelve salas {{that were}} built by Rama I, around the temple. They house {{interesting}} artefacts of regions such as Cambodia and Java. One of these salas had an inscription of Ramkamhaeng, which was shifted, in 1924, to the National Library. During {{the reign of}} King Mongkut, the Phra Gandharara – small chapel on the southwest corner – <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> belfry were new additions.|$|E
25|$|More towers {{were added}} over the ensuing decades, outside the {{periphery}} of the original site—as they were not part of Mies's master plan for the TD Centre—but still positioned close enough, and in such locations, as to visually impact the sense of space within areas of the centre, forming Miesian western and southern walls to the lawn <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> eastern flank to the plaza.|$|E
25|$|Vienne was {{director}} {{and owner of}} the Grande Roue de Paris, ('Great Wheel of Paris'), a 100m-high Ferris wheel built in 1900 for the world exhibition. It was demolished in 1920, but almost 100 years passed between its construction <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>taller</b> wheel being built.|$|R

25|$|The Sama was practised in the samahane (ritual hall) {{according}} to a precisely prescribed symbolic ritual with the dervishes whirling {{in a circle around}} their sheikh, who is the only one whirling around his axis. The Sama is performed by spinning on the Left foot. The dervishes wear a white gown (tennure) (symbol of death), a wide black cloak (hırka) (symbol of the grave) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> brown hat (kûlah or sikke), symbol of the tombstone.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} of {{traditional}} gabled form. The nave {{is at its}} north (symbolic west) end and an extended chancel with apse under a conical roof at its south (symbolic east) end. Facing Balmoral Terrace, the entrance porch {{is located on the}} north-east corner of the nave and, flanking the intersection of the nave and chancel, are two adjacent vestries <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> bell tower. On the western side of the chancel is a high-ceilinged organ chamber, now used as a chapel.|$|E
25|$|Bishop Hugh was {{responsible}} for the building of the first (wooden) Bishop's Palace at Buckden in Cambridgeshire, halfway between Lincoln and London. Later additions to the Palace were more substantial <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> brick tower was added in 1475, protected by walls and a moat, and surrounded by an outer bailey. It was used by the bishops until 1842. The Palace, now known as Buckden Towers, is owned by the Claretians and is used as a retreat and conference Centre. A Catholic church, dedicated to St Hugh, is located on the site.|$|E

25|$|From east to west, {{the first}} {{fountain}} is the Läuferbrunnen (German: Runner fountain) near the Nydegg Church on Nydeggstalden. The trough {{was built in}} 1824, but the figure dates from 1545. The Runner has moved several times since its creation, and until about 1663 {{was known as the}} Brunnen beim unteren Tor (Fountain by the lower gate). Originally the Läuferbrunnen had an octagonal trough <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall,</b> round column. The trough was replaced with a rectangular trough before 1757 which was replaced in 1824. The round column was replaced with the current square limestone pillar in the eighteenth or nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|The {{work also}} {{involved}} a complete {{overhaul of the}} GO concourses, deepening them to create two storeys of space. The lower storey will provide retail space and room for pedestrian traffic flow, and the upper storey will be dedicated to passenger traffic onto the platforms. This will expand not only the current GO concourse in {{the east of the}} building, but also open up the western end; GO Transit's presence in the building will nearly quadruple. Additional aesthetic points include glass roofs over the moat space around the north sides of the building, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> atrium over the central portions of the platforms. A new southern entrance, adjacent to the Air Canada Centre, opened in 2010.|$|E
25|$|The library {{aimed to}} provide open {{access to all}} its 900,000 volumes. No {{basement}} was possible because of the low level roads beneath the library <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> book stack was deemed inappropriate because of the desire to keep {{the height of the}} building low, so it did not overwhelm the surrounding buildings. Storage of the volumes was on the same level as the reading areas: this dual function led to the low ceiling height of three metres. Space was created in the reference library by opening up sections of the floors into double height reading spaces. The furniture for the library was specified by the architects, with a preference for oak veneer book stacks and black linoleum floor covering.|$|E
50|$|The {{rear of the}} {{building}} has been painted <b>and</b> has <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> T-shaped arched tank stand located centrally at the top.|$|R
60|$|In {{the great}} island of Ceram {{there is also}} an {{indigenous}} race very similar to that of Northern Gilolo. Bourn seems to contain two distinct races,--a shorter, round-faced people, with a Malay physiognomy, who may probably have come from Celebes by way of the Sula islands; <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>taller</b> bearded race, resembling that of Ceram.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from having}} a {{significantly}} shorter fuselage and one fewer cabin door per side, the 747SP differs from other 747 variants in having simplified flaps <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>taller</b> vertical tail to counteract the decrease in yaw moment-arm from the shortened fuselage. The 747SP uses single-piece flaps on the trailing edges, rather than the smaller triple-slotted flaps of standard 747s.|$|R
