5|$|On 8 February 1975, the {{government}} renamed the Banca Nazionale Somala to the Central Bank of Somalia (Bankiga Dhexe ee Soomaaliya). It also merged the Somali Commercial Bank and Somali Savings and Credit Bank (Cassa di Risparmio e Credito della Somalia) {{to form the}} Commercial <b>and</b> <b>Savings</b> Bank of Somalia, which {{was at the time}} the only bank in the country. In 1990 the Commercial <b>and</b> <b>Savings</b> Bank of Somalia discontinued operations. At some point the Central Bank of Somalia too ceased functioning.|$|E

5|$|Either way, {{many of the}} {{countries}} involved in the crisis are on the euro, so devaluation, individual interest rates, and capital controls are not available. The only solution left to raise a country's level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption <b>and</b> <b>savings</b> habits. For example, if a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this would reduce its trade deficit. It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.|$|E

The result holds for arbitrary utility and learning functions. Efficient incentives for education <b>and</b> <b>saving</b> are analysed under conditions of second and third best.

5|$|Nurkse {{argued against}} {{the notion that}} a large {{population}} implies a large market. Though underdeveloped countries have a large population, their levels of productivity are low. This results in low levels of per capita real income. Thus, consumption expenditure is low, <b>and</b> <b>savings</b> are either very low or completely absent. On the other hand, developed countries have smaller populations than underdeveloped countries but by virtue of high levels of productivity, their per capita real incomes are higher and thus they create a large market for goods and services.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Kimball {{began work}} at the Thatcher branch of the Arizona Trust <b>and</b> <b>Savings</b> Bank, where he was {{eventually}} promoted to assistant cashier at $225 per month, a high salary at the time. The bank failed in 1923, {{in the aftermath of}} the Depression of 1920–21; Kimball lost his $3000 investments in bank stock and was forced to take a lower-paying job at another bank. Kimball also performed a variety of other local jobs to earn extra income to support his wife and children, including playing the piano and singing at local events, stringing with Camilla for local newspapers, distributing for an herbal laxative company, and clerical work for local stores.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, {{along with}} his brother, William, and a mutual friend from law school, he became a {{founding}} partner of the Cincinnati law firm Keating, Muething & Keating. Beginning in the late 1950s they took on Carl Lindner, Jr. as a client. Lindner was rapidly accumulating ice cream stores, supermarkets, real estate, <b>and</b> <b>savings</b> and loans, and soon essentially became Keating's sole client. In 1956, he filed requests for Q clearances {{on behalf of a}} small company of former Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory scientists with an office in Newtown, Ohio; unknown to Keating, the FBI suspected the application was fraudulent and launched an investigation of him, but no charges were made. Keating was admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court bar in 1958.|$|E
40|$|We use the {{hyperbolic}} discounting {{model as}} the model that saving of each household varies in the steady state. In this model, there is a trade off that consumers will decrease future consumption <b>and</b> <b>saving</b> because of their temptation of current consumption. Therefore the degree of commitment technologies fixes consumption <b>and</b> <b>saving</b> paths. In this paper, we consider data of life planning as the commitment period of consumption and make an empirical analysis using the data about life planning of Public Opinion Survey on Household Financial Assets and Liabilities. We use the Tobit TSLS. We get the result that there exists the short-run trade off between consumption <b>and</b> <b>saving,</b> therefore consumers can increase their future consumption <b>and</b> <b>saving</b> by life planning. This result supports the hyperbolic discounting theory. ...|$|R
40|$|The more {{a country}} saves, the less it invests {{as a share}} of saving. We build a “store-or-sow” model of growth with precautionary <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> {{investment}} to study the nonlinear relationship between investment <b>and</b> <b>saving.</b> We contend that income volatility is an important variable for explaining <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> investment dynamics. Our results indicate that as permanent volatility increases, both investment <b>and</b> <b>saving</b> increase until a threshold at which point investment plummets while precautionary saving surges. In contrast, with larger volatility of temporary shocks, investment falls <b>and</b> precautionary <b>saving</b> gradually increases. Faced with high permanent volatility, big savers invest relatively little. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s Credit Suisse began {{catering}} to consumers and the middle-class with deposit counters, currency exchanges <b>and</b> <b>savings</b> accounts. The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel. The bank helped companies affected by World War I restructuring, and extended loans for reconstruction efforts. During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts. After World War II, {{a substantial portion}} of Credit Suisse's business was in foreign reconstruction efforts. Holocaust survivors had problems trying to retrieve assets from relatives that died in concentration camps without death certificates. This led to a class action lawsuit in 1996 that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion. The Agreement on the Swiss Banks' Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise of Due Diligence was created in the 1970s, after a Credit Suisse branch in Chiasso was exposed for illegally funneling $900 million in Italian deposits to speculative investments.|$|E

This was the only modern office building {{in the town of}} Harrisburg suitable for headquarters, and the forest has continued to occupy this building as Supervisor's offices. Expansion of the offices has continued since 1933, until today (June 1938), ten rooms on the third floor, and four rooms on the fourth floor, are leased by the Forest Service. Employees who were here during {{the early days of the}} forest tell of the chaos and confusion caused by the small space under lease, the incoming shipments of equipment and supplies, and the constant inflow of new personnel.|$|E
