5|$|Only recently, the <b>assembly</b> {{process of}} the 19S {{regulatory}} particle has been elucidated to considerable extent. The 19S regulatory particle assembles as two distinct subcomponents, the base and the lid. <b>Assembly</b> of the base complex is facilitated by four <b>assembly</b> chaperones, Hsm3/S5b, Nas2/p27, Rpn14/PAAF1, and Nas6/gankyrin (names for yeast/mammals). These <b>assembly</b> chaperones bind to the AAA-ATPase subunits and their main function {{seems to be to}} ensure proper <b>assembly</b> of the heterohexameric AAA-ATPase ring. To date it is still under debate whether the base complex assembles separately, whether the <b>assembly</b> is templated by the 20S core particle, or whether alternative <b>assembly</b> pathways exist. In addition to the four <b>assembly</b> chaperones, the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6/Usp14 also promotes base <b>assembly,</b> but it is not essential. The lid assembles separately in a specific order and does not require <b>assembly</b> chaperones.|$|E

We propose that an application can potentially consist of multiple sets of <b>assemblies,</b> all known to the application’s programmers. Each set implements the application’s functionality in some special way, e. g. using only patent-free algorithms or being optimised for 64 -bit processors. Depending on the <b>assemblies</b> available on a user’s machine, the dynamic linking process will select a suitable set and load <b>assemblies</b> from it.

NET virtual machine, by modifying its linking infrastructure to efficiently find <b>assemblies</b> on the user’s machine that satisfy the application’s specifications. Specifications can be applied to individual classes and methods, so that only code wishing to use alternative <b>assemblies</b> has to undergo the modified linking process. ...|$|R
