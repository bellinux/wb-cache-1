40|$|IntroductionThis study {{aimed to}} assess the {{coverage}} of herpes zoster (HZ) vaccine among a large cohort of insured individuals aged ≥ 50 years from 2007 to 2013, and to determine the factors associated with being vaccinated for <b>adults</b> <b>aged</b> ≥ 60 years. MethodsThis was a retrospective, observational study using the MarketScan® database conducted in 2015. The study population was U. S. <b>adults</b> <b>aged</b> ≥ 60 years during 2007 − 2013 and 50 – 59 years during 2011 – 2013. The claims of each eligible subject were evaluated post–index date to assess HZ vaccine uptake. Multivariate analyses were performed to understand factors associated with receiving HZ vaccine. ResultsA total of 6, 746, 476 <b>adults</b> <b>aged</b> ≥ 60 years and 6, 770, 294 <b>adults</b> <b>aged</b> 50 – 59 years were identified. By 2013, 1. 7 % of <b>adults</b> <b>aged</b> 50 – 59 years, 23. 9 % of <b>adults</b> <b>aged</b> 60 – 64 years, and 14. 5 % of <b>adults</b> <b>aged</b> ≥ 65 years received HZ vaccine. <b>Adults</b> <b>aged</b> ≥ 65 years {{were less likely to}} receive HZ vaccine than those aged 60 – 64 years (hazard ratio [HR]= 0. 543; 95 % CI= 0. 539, 0. 547). Adults who were female, immunocompetent, and had more outpatient hospital, doctor office, and pharmacy visits were more likely to receive HZ vaccine. Adults who received influenza vaccine were more likely to receive HZ vaccine (HR= 1. 841; 95 % CI= 1. 830, 1. 853). ConclusionsEstimated HZ vaccine coverage is 19. 5 % in <b>adults</b> <b>aged</b> ≥ 60 years, which is lower than the Healthy People 2020 target of 30 %. Providers should identify every opportunity for HZ vaccination to assure that older adults are protected from HZ, a vaccine-preventable disease...|$|R
