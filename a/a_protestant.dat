5|$|In September 1932 Nash married Irene Roles in Launceston, with City and Tasmania team mate Ted Pickett {{acting as}} best man. Due to the strict sectarianism of the 1930s, {{there was some}} {{controversy}} as Irene was <b>a</b> <b>Protestant</b> from one of Launceston's establishment families, and the wedding was held in <b>a</b> <b>Protestant</b> church. For years afterwards, Nash was subjected to a campaign by Catholic clergy to hold a Catholic wedding ceremony to legitimise his marriage but refused.|$|E

5|$|Mary, a Roman Catholic, reigned {{during a}} period of great {{religious}} upheaval in Scotland. As a result of the efforts of reformers such as John Knox, <b>a</b> <b>Protestant</b> ascendancy was established. Mary caused alarm by marrying her Catholic cousin, Lord Darnley, in 1565. After Lord Darnley's assassination in 1567, Mary contracted an even more unpopular marriage with the Earl of Bothwell, who was widely suspected of Darnley's murder. The nobility rebelled against the Queen, forcing her to abdicate. She fled to England, and the Crown went to her infant son James VI, who was brought up as <b>a</b> <b>Protestant.</b> Mary was imprisoned and later executed by the English queen Elizabeth I.|$|E

5|$|Most {{probably}} born in Warwickshire, Catesby {{was educated}} in nearby Oxford. His family were prominent recusant Catholics, and presumably to avoid swearing the Oath of Supremacy he left college before taking his degree.

5|$|Elizabeth and her {{advisers}} {{perceived the}} threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought <b>a</b> <b>Protestant</b> solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants; she would not tolerate the more radical Puritans though, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms. As a result, the parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the Protestant settlement of Edward VI, with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.|$|E
