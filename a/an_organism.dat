5|$|The {{scientific}} name of <b>an</b> <b>organism</b> is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans {{are listed as}} Homo sapiens. Homo is the genus, and sapiens the species. When writing the {{scientific name}} of <b>an</b> <b>organism,</b> it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.|$|E
5|$|A primary size-limiting {{factor is}} the amount of {{atmospheric}} oxygen. Without a complex circulatory system, low concentrations of oxygen cannot reach the centre of <b>an</b> <b>organism</b> quickly enough to supply its metabolic demand.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation is the {{evolutionary}} process whereby <b>an</b> <b>organism</b> becomes {{better able to}} live in its habitat or habitats.|$|E
5000|$|The genotype-phenotype {{distinction}} is drawn in genetics. [...] "Genotype" [...] is <b>an</b> <b>organism's</b> full hereditary information. [...] "Phenotype" [...] is <b>an</b> <b>organism's</b> actual observed properties, such as morphology, development, or behavior. This {{distinction is}} fundamental {{in the study}} of inheritance of traits and their evolution.|$|R
25|$|Tissue residue is the {{concentration}} of a chemical or compound in <b>an</b> <b>organism’s</b> tissue, or <b>a</b> portion of <b>an</b> <b>organism’s</b> tissue. Tissue residue is used in aquatic toxicology to help determine the fate of chemicals in aquatic systems, bioaccumulation of a substance, bioavailability of a substance, account for multiple routes of exposure (ingestion, absorption, inhalation), and address <b>an</b> <b>organism’s</b> exposure to chemical mixtures. A Tissue residue approach to toxicity testing is considered a more direct and less variable measure of chemical exposure and is less dependent on external environmental factors than measuring {{the concentration}} of a chemical in the exposure media.|$|R

5|$|Adaptedness is {{the state}} of being adapted: the degree to which <b>an</b> <b>organism</b> is able to live and {{reproduce}} in a given set of habitats.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is the modification of an organism's genome through biotechnology. Since the 1970s, {{a variety of}} techniques have been developed to specifically add, remove and edit genes in <b>an</b> <b>organism.</b> Recently developed genome engineering techniques use engineered nuclease enzymes to create targeted DNA repair in a chromosome to either disrupt or edit a gene when the break is repaired. The related term synthetic biology is sometimes used to refer to extensive genetic engineering of <b>an</b> <b>organism.</b>|$|E
5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of <b>an</b> <b>organism.</b> Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines {{the size of its}} genetic contribution to the next generation. However, fitness {{is not the same as}} the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes. For example, if <b>an</b> <b>organism</b> could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.|$|E
50|$|Overpopulation—when <b>an</b> <b>organism's</b> numbers {{exceed the}} {{carrying}} capacity of its habitat.|$|R

50|$|In immunology, {{self-protein}} designates proteins normally {{produced by}} <b>a</b> particular <b>organism.</b> <b>A</b> particular <b>organism's</b> immune {{system should be}} tolerant to self-proteins; if not, there is autoimmunity.|$|R
5|$|The {{complete}} set of viruses in <b>an</b> <b>organism</b> or habitat is called the virome; for example, all human viruses constitute the human virome.|$|E
5|$|The genome is {{the total}} genetic {{material}} of <b>an</b> <b>organism</b> and includes both the genes and non-coding sequences.|$|E
5|$|The {{welfare of}} <b>an</b> <b>organism</b> O is, {{at least in}} part, to be {{understood}} in terms of the interests, rather than the desires, of O.|$|E
50|$|Whole genome {{sequencing}} (also known as WGS, full {{genome sequencing}}, complete genome sequencing, or entire genome sequencing) {{is the process}} of determining the complete DNA sequence of <b>an</b> <b>organism's</b> genome at <b>a</b> single time. This entails sequencing all of <b>an</b> <b>organism's</b> chromosomal DNA as well as DNA contained in the mitochondria and, for plants, in the chloroplast.|$|R
50|$|In psychology, Transmarginal inhibition, or TMI, is <b>an</b> <b>organism's</b> {{response}} to overwhelming stimuli.|$|R
50|$|Idea that {{no single}} source of {{influence}} has central control over <b>an</b> <b>organism's</b> development.|$|R
5|$|A {{habitat is}} an {{ecological}} or environmental {{area that is}} inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which <b>an</b> <b>organism</b> lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.|$|E
5|$|A {{pathogen}} is only {{successful in}} infecting <b>an</b> <b>organism</b> {{if it can}} get past its defenses. Pathogenic bacteria and protozoa have developed {{a variety of methods}} to resist attacks by phagocytes, and many actually survive and replicate within phagocytic cells.|$|E
5|$|Genes {{are made}} from DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and, in many viruses, RNA (ribonucleic acid). The {{biological}} information contained in <b>an</b> <b>organism</b> is encoded in its DNA or RNA. Most organisms use DNA, but many viruses have RNA as their genetic material. The DNA or RNA of viruses consists of either a single strand or a double helix.|$|E

50|$|Epigeal, epigean, epigeic and {{epigeous}} are biological terms describing <b>an</b> <b>organism's</b> activity {{above the}} soil surface.|$|R
50|$|Hypogeal, hypogean, hypogeic and hypogeous are {{biological}} terms describing <b>an</b> <b>organism's</b> activity {{below the}} soil surface.|$|R
5|$|Genomic DNA is {{tightly and}} orderly packed {{in the process}} called DNA condensation, to fit the small {{available}} volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA {{is located in the}} cell nucleus, with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in <b>an</b> <b>organism</b> is called its genotype. A gene is a unit of heredity and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in <b>an</b> <b>organism.</b> Genes contain an open reading frame that can be transcribed, and regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers, which control transcription of the open reading frame.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry {{occurs when}} <b>an</b> <b>organism</b> (the mimic) simulates signal {{properties}} of another organism (the model) to confuse a third organism. This {{results in the}} mimic gaining protection, food, and mating advantages. There are two classical types of defensive mimicry: Batesian and Müllerian. Both involve aposematic coloration, or warning signals, to avoid being attacked by a predator.|$|E
5|$|Robert Koch, {{a pioneer}} in medical microbiology, worked on cholera, anthrax and tuberculosis. In his {{research}} into tuberculosis Koch finally proved the germ theory, for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1905. In Koch's postulates, he set out criteria to test if <b>an</b> <b>organism</b> {{is the cause of}} a disease, and these postulates are still used today.|$|E
50|$|Genomics {{is an area}} within {{genetics}} {{that concerns}} the sequencing and analysis of <b>an</b> <b>organism’s</b> genome.|$|R
50|$|Dawkins {{argues that}} the only thing that genes control {{directly}} is the synthesis of proteins. He points to the arbitrariness of restricting the idea of the phenotype to apply only to the phenotypic expression of <b>an</b> <b>organism's</b> genes in its own body. Dawkins develops this idea by pointing to the effect that a gene may have on <b>an</b> <b>organism's</b> environment through that organism's behaviour.|$|R
50|$|In genetics, {{a three-point}} cross {{is used to}} {{determine}} the loci of three genes in <b>an</b> <b>organism's</b> genome.|$|R
5|$|The early 19th-century {{zoologist}} Jean-Baptiste Lamarck {{suggested the}} inheritance of acquired characteristics {{as a mechanism}} for evolutionary change; adaptive traits acquired by <b>an</b> <b>organism</b> during its lifetime could be inherited by that organism's progeny, eventually causing transmutation of species. This theory, Lamarckism, was an influence on the Soviet biologist Trofim Lysenko's antagonism to mainstream genetic theory {{as late as the}} mid 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{metabolic}} {{system of}} a particular organism determines which substances it will find nutritious and which poisonous. For example, some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide as a nutrient, yet this gas is poisonous to animals. The speed of metabolism, the metabolic rate, influences how much food <b>an</b> <b>organism</b> will require, and also affects how {{it is able to}} obtain that food.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{cementation}} of the overlying substrate {{relative to}} the rate of decomposition of the organism determines whether the top or bottom surface of <b>an</b> <b>organism</b> is preserved. Most disc-shaped fossils decomposed before the overlying sediment was cemented, whereupon ash or sand slumped in to fill the void, leaving a cast of the organism's underside.|$|E
50|$|Homeostasis is {{a concept}} central {{to the idea of}} stress. In biology, most {{biochemical}} processes strive to maintain equilibrium (homeostasis), a steady state that exists more as an ideal and less as an achievable condition. Environmental factors, internal or external stimuli, continually disrupt homeostasis; <b>an</b> <b>organism's</b> present condition is a state of constant flux moving about a homeostatic point that is that organism's optimal condition for living. Factors causing <b>an</b> <b>organism's</b> condition to diverge too far from homeostasis can be experienced as stress. A life-threatening situation such as a major physical trauma or prolonged starvation can greatly disrupt homeostasis. On the other hand, <b>an</b> <b>organism's</b> attempt at restoring conditions back to or near homeostasis, often consuming energy and natural resources, can also be interpreted as stress.|$|R
50|$|In medicine, {{desensitization}} is {{a method}} to reduce or eliminate <b>an</b> <b>organism's</b> negative reaction to a substance or stimulus.|$|R
50|$|Consensus exists among {{evolutionary}} biologists {{that one}} should not separate <b>an</b> <b>organism's</b> genes from the context of its resident microbes.|$|R
