When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they {{contribute to the development}} of cultural biases <b>and</b> <b>prejudices,</b> (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.|$|E

25|$|However, Rana's {{formal and}} {{conceptual}} departure from this traditional style and medium is distinctly his own. The stark contrast of the Muslim {{women in their}} traditional dress with the exposed nudity of the Western porn stars forces a powerful shift in focus between the poles of these two stereotypes and alludes to the great cultural divide between East and West. Fascinated by how meaning is often misunderstood in our media-oriented society, Rana's photographic practice cleverly creates images that offer an alternative view of how popular ideas <b>and</b> <b>prejudices</b> are created.|$|E

Among the populist tabloids, The Sun/Sun on Sunday and the Daily Mirror/Sunday Mirror were found to contain the most negative coverage of UKIP, while the Daily Express and Sunday Express—owned by UKIP donor Richard Desmond—gave significantly lower coverage to the gaffes <b>and</b> <b>prejudices</b> of UKIP representatives.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{meta-analysis}} of publications {{of the relationship of}} right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) to racial/ethnic prejudice. In addition to examining the relationship between RWA <b>and</b> <b>prejudice,</b> two control/comparison analyses were conducted. The first looks at the relationship between RWA and attitudes toward homosexuality over the same time period as the racial prejudice analysis. An additional set of control analyses involved social dominance orientation (SDO). The hypothesis was that the relationship between RWA <b>and</b> racial/ethnic <b>prejudice</b> has decreased over time but that the relationships between RWA <b>and</b> anti-gay <b>prejudice</b> <b>and</b> the relationship between SDO <b>and</b> racial/ethnic <b>prejudice</b> <b>and</b> SDO <b>and</b> anti-gay <b>prejudice</b> will be relatively stable over time.

25|$|The plot {{has been}} related to {{invasion}} literature of the time. The novel has been variously interpreted as a commentary on evolutionary theory, British imperialism, and generally Victorian superstitions, fears <b>and</b> <b>prejudices.</b> At the time of publication, it was classified as a scientific romance, like Wells' earlier novel The Time Machine. The War of the Worlds has been both popular (having never been out of print) and influential, spawning half a dozen feature films, radio dramas, a record album, various comic book adaptations, a television series, and sequels or parallel stories by other authors. It has even influenced the work of scientists, notably Robert H.

25|$|In early 1945 Powers was {{directed}} to a race relations meeting in Chicago with the new American Council on Race Relations and began an endeavor of learning himself and then promulgating race relations issues across police departments. The first major project started in Richmond, California with Davis McEntire. Initial efforts were aimed at training the police in human relations including trying to eliminate prejudice and present the unfairness of segregation and discrimination based on race - factors later observed to be widespread needs. The work brought together leaders of the California Department of Corrections, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Japanese American Citizens League, and a Nisei, second-generation American of Japanese descent, US Marine. Together the social norms <b>and</b> <b>prejudices</b> of the day were vented, discussed, and broken down across a week of open-ended discussions. Following the training incendiary incidents arose {{in the community and}} the police took novel actions ensuring fairness and peace was retained. The Saturday Evening Post covered it in Cops don't have to be brutal, Dec 28, 1946. Following this numerous police departments even outside California were informed of the training and a booklet A Guide to Race Relations for Peace Officers was created and distributed, (including excerpts in the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper.) There was a prospective project by the young American Council on Race Relations using it and on making a training film with Powers writing the script, working with Edwin Embree. Out of this Powers was on a short list of leaders in the field though more recent scholarship critiqued the program for not including the local minority leadership of the time.|$|E
