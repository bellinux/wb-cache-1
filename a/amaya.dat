5|$|The W3C and the INRIA, a French {{national}} research institution, gave additional funding to develop CSS. To better implement and write CSS, an experimental style sheet for Arena was developed. On 22 May 1996, the W3C announced that <b>Amaya</b> will replace Arena as their new testbed {{and that the}} W3C {{was looking for a}} new maintainer because the W3C didn't have the resources for two testbeds.|$|E

5|$|After {{its initial}} self-published release, Cave Story slowly gained {{popularity}} on the Internet. It received wide critical acclaim for its compelling story and gameplay. Independent developer Nicalis worked with <b>Amaya</b> to port {{the game to}} WiiWare and DSiWare in 2010. An enhanced version, Cave Story+, was released for Steam in November 2011, with a Nintendo 3DS release in October 2012. A 3D remake of the game, titled Cave Story 3D, was developed by Nicalis and published by NIS America for the Nintendo 3DS in November 2011. A release for the Nintendo Switch was announced on April 5, 2017 by Nicalis, and released on June 20, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Beta-3a {{released}} on 14 August 1996 and Beta-3b {{released on}} 16 September 1996 introduced {{support for the}} Linux operating systems on m68k and DEC Alpha. CSS 1 support was enhanced and the internationalized version was also updated. Between the two beta-3 releases the W3C was already looking at a new testbed and switched later to the <b>Amaya</b> browser. Beta-3 was the last involvement of the W3C {{in the development of}} Arena. On 17 February 1997, Yggdrasil Computing took over the role of developing the browser.|$|E
5|$|La Mesa {{residents}} {{also expressed}} {{concerns about the}} destruction of homes under some of the proposals for the <b>Amaya</b> Drive interchange design, which the city council also endorsed. However, the council approved the construction and design of the Fletcher Parkway interchange in January 1991, over those objections. Further interchange-related concerns were raised from Lemon Grove homeowners the next year. In August 1993, Caltrans agreed to design the new freeway to keep it west of the Sweetwater Reservoir, which satisfied Spring Valley while raising concerns from those living in Bonita, who would be closer to this new routing.|$|E

5|$|Maryland {{kicked off}} to Nevada {{to start the}} second half, and the teams again {{exchanged}} punts twice. Kaepernick sat out the next series due to his sprained ankle. Backup quarterback Nick Graziano took over {{but was unable to}} complete two passes and Nevada punted a third time. In the next series, Turner threw an interception to Nevada safety Jonathan <b>Amaya,</b> who returned it for 33yards to the Maryland 22-yard line, then fumbled. The ball was recovered by Nevada, and Kaepernick capitalized on the turnover with a 17-yard touchdown pass to Taua, narrowing Nevada's deficit to 28–21.|$|E
5|$|Cave Story 3D is a 3D {{version of}} the game {{developed}} by Nicalis and published by NIS America as a retail title for the Nintendo 3DS. It was released on 8 November 2011 in North America, 11 November 2011 in Europe and 26 July 2012 in Japan. The game was built from scratch using 3D character models, featuring a dynamic camera system and another additional level, {{as well as a}} remixed soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky. The Japanese version features crossover content from various NIS and other companies' franchises such as Crazy Climber, Ikki, and Dragon Slayer. In order to devote more time to perfecting the title, <b>Amaya</b> quit his job as a software developer to become director of Cave Story 3D. He remarked that the transition to 3D was difficult because it required the consideration of so many more details.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, Beshear's {{administration}} {{attempted to}} {{seize control of}} 141 gambling-related domain names {{in an attempt to}} block Kentucky residents from accessing those websites. Beshear claimed the sites were conducting illegal, unregulated gambling operations in the state and providing untaxed competition to the state's horse racing industry. Later that year, a Franklin County judge ruled that Beshear had the authority to seize the domain names, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals overturned that ruling on appeal. Beshear appealed to the Kentucky Supreme Court, partially on grounds that the web site owners were being represented by gambling associations and players groups who Beshear said had no legal standing in the case. In 2010, the Kentucky Supreme Court agreed with Beshear and ordered the web site owners themselves to appear before the court. On December 23, 2015, Franklin County Circuit Court Judge Thomas Wingate ruled in favor of the state and awarded it $870 million in damages. The other party to the case, <b>Amaya</b> Gaming, announced they would appeal the decision.|$|E

Warhol was seriously wounded by the attack and barely survived: surgeons opened his chest and massaged his heart to help stimulate its movement again. He suffered physical effects {{for the rest of his}} life, including being required to wear a surgical corset. The shooting had a profound effect on Warhol's life and art.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Amaya's</b> first works, Luna nueva (1983) and Seda en mi piel (1984), were {{an example}} of flamenco-rock.

25|$|On June 3, 1968, radical feminist writer Valerie Solanas shot Warhol and Mario <b>Amaya,</b> {{art critic}} and curator, at Warhol's studio.

50|$|The story {{revolves}} around Juliana Miguez, {{a girl from}} Rio Manso, fictional town in the Province of Buenos Aires, who is kidnapped by a network of human trafficking. It represents her point of view, from within the network, that of his mother, who tries to find and rescue her through various means, and the criminals who run that operating system. At first the story is held equally by that history and a telenovela plot involving Facundo Arana, the most famous actor of the cast, but the acclaim achieved by the most committed portion of the plot led to this one to include the whole story and all characters thereof. Bautista <b>Amaya's</b> character, played by Arana, reaches characteristics of an action hero instead of those of a gentleman of a normal telenovela.|$|R
50|$|Six {{months after}} the before-mentioned, Ana has another baby (son of Rodrigo) and Patito has changed her look thanks to her grandmother.

Giovanni's arrival represents immediate competition to Mateo {{and all the other}} CAMP boys, yet he becomes Antonella's ally as she attempts to take Patito out of the Divinas' way. Meanwhile Rodrigo wants to spend as much time as possible with his children and wife and great surprises await throughout the second chapter: a woman who will tell Bianca how {{to get a hold of}} Ana's body and get her out of her life; the return of <b>Amaya's</b> biological mother; Patito's quinceañera (a 15th birthday celebration, like a Sweet Sixteen); and the arrival of new loves, great friends and mortal enemies.|$|R
