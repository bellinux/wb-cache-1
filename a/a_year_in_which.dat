5|$|After the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917, the new Russian Provisional Government in Petrograd {{had little}} {{influence}} over Ukraine. Khrushchev {{was elected to}} the worker's council (or soviet) in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman. He did not join the Bolsheviks until 1918, <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the Russian Civil War, between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the White Army, began in earnest. His biographer, William Taubman, suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the Mensheviks who prioritized economic progress, whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was difficult to keep them all straight.|$|E

5|$|After the election, Roosevelt {{continued}} to promote progressive ideals, a New Nationalism, much to Taft's dismay. Roosevelt attacked his successor's administration, arguing that its guiding principles were {{not that of}} the party of Lincoln, but those of the Gilded Age. The feud continued on and off through 1911, <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> there were few elections of significance. Wisconsin Senator La Follette announced a presidential run as a Republican, and was backed by a convention of progressives. Roosevelt began {{to move into a}} position for a run in late 1911, writing that the tradition that presidents not run for a third term only applied to consecutive terms.|$|E
5|$|After {{working for}} his father for two years with the NFL's Arizona Cardinals, Ryan {{returned}} to college coaching as the defensive coordinator for the Cincinnati Bearcats. The Bearcats won the first Humanitarian Bowl over Utah State in Ryan's final year, marking the team's first bowl appearance in fifty years. Ryan was the Oklahoma Sooners' defensive coordinator for <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the defense was ranked sixth in the nation. However, head coach John Blake failed to achieve a winning record for a third straight year and subsequently, the entire staff was fired. Ryan served as defensive coordinator at Kansas State for a month in 1999 under head coach Bill Snyder.|$|E

5|$|Clark's {{successor}} as MP, Stewart Jackson, was re-elected in 2010 with {{an increased}} majority, which then fell in 2015.

5|$|Khrushchev's U.S. visit {{resulted}} in an informal agreement with U.S. president Dwight Eisenhower {{that there would be}} no firm deadline over Berlin, but that there would be a four-power summit to try to resolve the issue, and the premier left the U.S. to general good feelings. Khrushchev returned from the U.S. convinced that he had achieved a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower (who in fact was unimpressed by the Soviet leader) and that he could achieve détente with the Americans. He pushed for an immediate summit, but was frustrated by French President Charles de Gaulle, who postponed it until 1960, <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Eisenhower was scheduled to pay a return visit to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's only {{significant}} military defeat {{occurred during the}} Siege of Petersburg. His II Corps moved south of the city, along the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, tearing up track. On August 25, Confederate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth attacked and overran the faulty Union position at Reams's Station, shattering the II Corps, capturing many prisoners. Despite a later victory at Hatcher's Run, the humiliation of Reams's Station contributed, along with the lingering effects of his Gettysburg wound, to his decision to give up field command in November. He left the II Corps after <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it had suffered over 40,000 casualties, but had achieved significant military victories. His next assignment was to command the ceremonial First Veteran Corps. He performed more recruiting, commanded the Middle Department, and relieved Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan in command of forces in the now-quiet Shenandoah Valley. He was promoted to brevet major general in the regular army for his service at Spotsylvania, effective March 13, 1865.|$|E

5|$|In all, Hutson caught 488 {{passes for}} 7,991 yards and 99 touchdowns. He rushed for three touchdowns, scored two touchdowns on blocked punts, {{and had an}} {{interception}} return touchdown for a career total of 105. He scored at least six receiving touchdowns {{in each of his}} eleven seasons. Hutson led the NFL in receptions eight times, including five consecutive times: 1941 to 1945. He led the NFL in receiving yards seven times, including four straight times: 1941 to 1944. He led the NFL in scoring five times: 1941 to 1945. As of 2016, Hutson still holds the highest career average touchdowns per game for a receiver, at 0.85. Hutson's single season record of 17 touchdown receptions in 1942 stood for 42 years until broken by receiver Mark Clayton in 1984, <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Miami's quarterback Dan Marino had more completions (362) than the entire 1942 Packers team's pass attempts (330). His four receiving touchdowns in a game has been surpassed three times and tied several times, but his four in a single quarter has yet to be matched. His record 99 touchdown receptions stood for 44 years, well into the modern era. In his eleven-year professional career, Hutson never missed a game due to injury. He invented many pass routes still in use today, including the chair route.|$|E

The film grossed $74,888,996 in North America, {{for a total of}} $96,888,996 worldwide. The Undiscovered Countrys strong showing was one of the big successes of 1991, <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the film {{industry}} experienced disappointing box office results overall. The film was nominated in the Sound effects editing and Makeup categories at the 64th Academy Awards. The film also won a Saturn Award for best science fiction film, making it the only Star Trek film to win the award. The film's novelization by J.M. Dillard was also a commercial success, reaching the Publishers Weekly mass market paperback bestsellers list.|$|E
5|$|The win {{continued}} Kiprop's meteoric rise of 2010 – <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he {{had gone}} from a low-profile circuit runner to the 10,000 metres Kenyan and African champion, with a sub-60 minute half marathon best after wins in Paris and Lille. Silver medallist Zersenay received some consolation as {{he was given the}} AIMS/Citizen World's Fastest Time Award days after the competition in respect of his position as world record holder, becoming only the second half marathon athlete to be selected for the accolade after Lornah Kiplagat. There were no surprise breakthroughs in the men's race as all the top performers were those predicted to make an impact before the race. However, there were some other achievements of note including: Kitwara's first individual medal for Kenya, personal bests for Birhanu Bekele and Tomoya Onishi in eighth and ninth place respectively, and (much further back in the field) a national record for Bhutanese racer Passang Passang.|$|E

5|$|Now {{known as}} Takanohana, {{he was also}} the {{youngest}} ever to be promoted to ōzeki at 20years 5months. With the foreign born Akebono as sumo's only yokozuna, there was a great weight of expectation on Takanohana to make the next step up. However, his lack of consistency, and Akebono's dominance, delayed his promotion to yokozuna. He won his third championship in May 1993, but lost a playoff to Akebono in the following tournament in July, and even produced a make-koshi or losing score of 7–8 in November. In 1994, <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Akebono suffered several injury problems, Takanohana won the January and May tournaments, but was then outshone by Musashimaru, who won in July with a perfect 15–0 record. After taking the September 1994 championship, Takanohana now had six top division titles, but none had been won consecutively. No previous wrestler had ever accumulated so many titles before reaching sumo's highest rank. The Sumo Association nominated him for yokozuna after the September tournament, but the Yokozuna Deliberation Council failed to endorse it by the required two-thirds majority, the first time this had happened in twenty five years. They insisted that two consecutive championships were required, having demanded the same of Akebono before his promotion. In November 1994, Takanohana at last managed to win two consecutive tournaments, with his second consecutive unbeaten 15–0 score, and his promotion was confirmed. He had been at the ōzeki rank for 11 tournaments, or nearly two years. However, at 22years and 3months, he was still the third youngest yokozuna ever at the time.|$|E
