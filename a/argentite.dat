40|$|Silver sulfide, Ag 2 S, is most {{commonly}} known as the tarnish that forms on silver surfaces due to exposure of silver to hydrogen sulfide.

Both hightemperature cubic phases are solid-state silver ion conductors. In situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction was used to better understand the polymorphs of Ag 2 S on heating. The existing Powder Diffraction File (PDF) entries for the high-temperature FCC polymorph are of questionable reliability, prompting a full Rietveld structure refinement of the BCC and FCC polymorphs.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Tyndrum Pb-Zn {{mineralization}} ccurs as {{veins and}} vein breccias in NE SW trending fractures {{associated with the}} Tyndrum-Glen-Fyne fault. The major minerals are quartz, galena, and sphalerite with minor chalcopyrite and baryte. Tetrahedrite (sometimes silver-and cadmium-rich), pyrargyrite, marcasite, and pyrite occur as small inclusions (< 100 #m) in the galena-rich veins. Sphalerite formed early in the depositional sequence, mainly in breccias, with increasing amounts of galena nd chalcopyrite d posited inthe later vein stages of mineralization. Uraniferous veins post-date the main Pb Zn mineralization and contain uraninite, calcite, baryte, galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, <b>argentite,</b> chalco-cite, tetrabedrite, and safltorite. Fluid inclusion studies reveal that the mineralizing solutions contained c. 20 wt. ~o equivalent NaCI + KC 1, had an Na/K ratio of 3 : 1 and were boiling during mineral precipitation. The Tyndrum fault controlled the upward flow of the hydrothermal solutions and its intersection with fractures in quartzites favoured the siting of the veins.

Mineralogy of Se-type deposits at Pongkor, Cikidang, Cibaliung, Cisungsang, and Cirotan and Te-type deposits at Arinem and Cineam shows their different geochemical characteristics. Mineralogical and geochemical differences can be explained by variation of physico-chemical conditions that existed during gold-silver deposition by applying the phase relation among sulfide, telluride, and selenide mineral association in the deposits. The relative values of ƒSe 2 (g), ƒTe(g), and ƒS 2 (g) control the actual presence of selenide or telluride minerals within the West Java deposits, which also depend on their concentrations in the hydrothermal fluid. Even though the concentration of selenium in the hydrothermal fluid of Te-type deposits might have been similar or even higher than that in the Se-type, early substitution of selenium in the sulfide minerals prevents its concentration in the hydrothermal fluid to the levels for precipitating selenide minerals. Therefore, early sulfide mineral deposition from reduction fluids will not increase the ƒSe 2 (g) /ƒS 2 (g) ratio to form selenide minerals in Te-type deposits of Arinem and Cineam, other than selenium-bearing sulfide mineral such as Se-bearing galena or Se-bearing pyrargyrite-proustite...|$|E

30|$|Silver is a gleaming, very ductile, and {{malleable}} element but slightly {{harder than}} gold, with {{a symbol of}} Ag and atomic number of 47. It {{is one of the}} basic elements that make up our planet. In nature, it exists as a native element, as an alloy combining with other metals (e.g., gold) and as minerals (e.g., chlorargyrite and <b>argentite).</b> Chemically, silver possess four different oxidation states, i.e., Ag 0, Ag 1 +, Ag 2 +, and Ag 3 + (Riedel and Kaupp 2009). However, it is a chemically inactive element, but it can be reacted with nitric acid or hot concentrated sulfuric acid, forming soluble silver salts. It also possesses an excellent conductivity of heat and electricity, yet its applications in electrical industry have greatly been limited due to its greater cost (Wang et al. 2013). As for metallic silver form, it is insoluble in water, but its metallic salts such as silver nitrate, AgNO 3, and silver chloride, AgCl, are water-soluble. Over past decades, metallic silver is widely applied in surgical prosthesis and splints, coinage, and fungicides (Forough and Farhadi 2010). In contrast, its metallic salts have also been made use of treating various health illness and disorders, e.g., epilepsy, gonorrhea, and gastroenteritis. Due to its good absorptivity, soluble silver compounds have the risk of causing adverse effects on health through dietary intake. Nevertheless, Chen and Schluesener (2008) described that silver is relatively non-toxic and non-carcinogenic to human primary body systems such as nervous, immune, reproductive, or cardiovascular system. Therefore, the demand of silver has been escalating in recent years, exclusively in medical, plastics, and textiles industries.|$|E

The pyroclastic rocks are intruded by diorite, dacite and andesite, leading alteration and mineralization within the host rocks. Mineralization occurs as a vein type and {{is associated with}} a number of pervasive alteration types named respectively: quartz-illite- montmorillonite-kaolinite ± pyrite, quartz-illite ± pyrite, quartz-illite-chlorite ± pyrite and quartz- kaolinite-illite ± pyrite. On the other hand, a propylitic alteration also occurs within the andesite intrusion composed of calcite-epidote-chlorite-sericite-quartz ± pyrite. The mineralization is characterized by several zones of quartz stockwork containing gold and associated ore minerals of chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, pyrite and <b>argentite.</b> The quartz veins occurs as fi llings of structural openings in the form of milky quartz and amethyst with textures of sugary, comb, and dogteeth. Evaluation work on results of microscopic (petrography and mineragraphy), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and fl uid inclusion studies, and chemical analysis of entirely altered rock/quartz vein samples shows that the alteration and mineralization process were closely related to a change of hydrothermal fl uids, from near neutral into acid conditions at a temperature range of > 290 o – 100 oC. The appearances of quartz variation indicate a relationship with repeated episodes of boiling in an epithermal system, as ground water mixed with hot vapor originated from a remained post-magmatic solution. Corresponding to a salinity of average 1, 388 equiv. wt. % NaCl, it indicates that the ore minerals bearing quartz veins were deposited at a depth range of 640 – 1020 m beneath paleosurface...|$|E
