40|$|International audienceSouth America is {{considered}} a world biodiversity hotspot, especially for freshwater ecosystems where there is significant biodiversity and endemism across different taxonomic groups. Native South <b>American</b> <b>crayfishes</b> are characterized by small range distributions, high levels of endemism and specific habitat requirements. * Although this group may be {{considered one of the}} most threatened among South American freshwater crustaceans, IUCN Red List assessments for most of these species are ‘data deficient’. IUCN assessments are technical evaluations of species risk of extinction based on biological indicators of population features, thereby providing a ‘conservation status’ for each species based on common and international standards. * Attempts to assess the conservation status of native South <b>American</b> <b>crayfishes</b> have been limited mainly owing to a lack of fundamental data and also misinterpretations of present information. Thus, a revision of the state of knowledge of native South <b>American</b> <b>crayfishes</b> (taxonomy, phylogeny and distribution, genetics, ecology and threats) was carried out coupled with IUCN assessments of conservation status. * Globally, the lack of information on the biology of these species is still the major obstacle to making reliable conservation status assessments. For this reason, the Data Deficient (DD) category is still appropriate for many species. However, based on the Extent of Occurrence (EOO) and severely fragmented populations, number of locations and decline in area, extent or quality of habitat, it is recommended that some species (especially Virilastacus spp.) should be moved to threatened categories (VU, EN or CR). The data suggest that others are appropriately in the Near Threatened (NT) category, because they almost reach the thresholds for threatened categories. * The assessment of conservation status is essential to support future conservation actions, especially for species allocated to threatened categories. This study has identified new species under threat and also areas for future study to provide relevant data for conservation assessment for ‘data deficient’ species.

40|$|The {{crayfish}} plague pathogen, the oomycete Aphanomyces astaci, has been decimating populations of European crayfish species {{for more than}} 150 years, and is therefore {{considered one of the}} 100 worst world's invasive species. A. astaci is highly specialised for a parasitic life, but it can be isolated from moribund crayfish and grown on synthetic media, as it is the case also for several other oomycetes (chapter 7). The life of A. astaci includes three basic forms: mycelium in host's tissues, and the infective units occurring in water, zoospores and cysts. All North <b>American</b> <b>crayfish</b> species tested so far have shown some resistance to A. astaci, i. e., they could carry the infection for long, serving as vectors of the pathogen. Massive sporulation from infected North <b>American</b> <b>crayfish</b> starts when the host is moulting, stressed, or dying (chapter 4). However, I could show in my experiments that some sporulation occurs even from apparently healthy and non-moulting <b>American</b> <b>crayfish</b> hosting A. astaci, so infected North <b>American</b> <b>crayfish</b> must be considered a permanent source of the infection (chapter 4).

40|$|My Ph. D. thesis {{deals with}} {{various aspects of}} {{research}} of the crayfish plague pathogen, Aphanomyces astaci (Oomycetes). Crayfish plague decimates whole populations of European crayfish; therefore, {{it is one of}} the main problems for conservation of these species endangered from other reasons as well. The infection is transmitted by invasive North <b>American</b> <b>crayfish,</b> which are much less susceptible to the disease and are apparently original hosts of A. astaci. The core of this thesis consists of six studies. Four of them have been already published, the remaining two are manuscripts under review. The main linking motive among the presented studies is not only the crayfish plague pathogen itself, but also the use, development and verification of the reliability of molecular detection methods of A. astaci and its genotypes. This core of the thesis is further divided into two parts.

However, {{there is no consensus}} regarding the degree of association with burrows of each species.

40|$|The {{crayfish}} plague pathogen (Aphanomyces astaci) causes mass mortalities of European crayfish when transmitted {{from its original}} North <b>American</b> <b>crayfish</b> hosts. Little is known, however, about interspecific transmission of the pathogen between different <b>American</b> <b>crayfish</b> species, although evidence from trade of ornamental crayfish suggests this may happen in captivity. We screened signal and virile crayfish for A. astaci at allopatric and sympatric sites in a UK river. Whilst the pathogen was detected in signal crayfish from both sites, infected virile crayfish were only found in sympatry. Genotyping of A. astaci from virile crayfish suggested {{the presence of a}} strain related to one infecting British signal crayfish.

40|$|ABSTRACT - The {{crayfish}} plague pathogen, Aphanomyces astaci, {{is responsible for}} substantial declines and local extinctions of native European crayfish populations. As a consequence, the pathogen is now listed among 100 world's worst invasive alien species. The spread of A. astaci is greatly facilitated by its natural hosts, North <b>American</b> <b>crayfish,</b> that thanks to a long co-evolutionary history with the {{crayfish plague}} pathogen evolved efficient defence mechanisms. In contrast, European, Australian and Asian crayfish species are highly susceptible to this disease agent. However, progress of A. astaci infection in native European crayfish was observed to differ between distinct pathogen strains, indicating variability in their virulence. Indeed, we demonstrated a relationship between patterns in crayfish immune response and A. astaci virulence in an experimental infection involving the European noble crayfish and three differently virulent crayfish plague strains. The European continent is currently inhabited by at least eight North <b>American</b> <b>crayfish</b> species. The carrier status was confirmed in six of them, including also Orconectes cf. virilis occurring in the Netherlands and the UK. In this country, we detected Aphanomyces astaci presence in some populations of the non-indigenous crayfish species as well [...] ...|$|E
40|$|North <b>American</b> <b>{{crayfish}}</b> {{species are}} natural hosts of the crayfish plague pathogen Aphanomyces astaci. The spiny-cheek crayfish Orconectes limosus, widespread in Central Europe, {{is the main}} reservoir of A. astaci in Czech Republic. We tested if there are temporal changes in the prevalence of infected individuals (i. e., the proportion of individuals in which the pathogen is detected) in spiny-cheek crayfish populations. Crayfish from three populations shown previously to be infected to different extents (high, intermediate and low), were repeatedly sampled in different years (2004 – 2010) and seasons. The presence of A. astaci in the soft abdominal crayfish cuticle was tested by specific amplification of the pathogen DNA. There was no substantial temporal variation in pathogen prevalence in the highly and very lowly infected populations. However, a significant long-term as well as seasonal decrease {{was found in the}} intermediately infected population. This decline could be related to a decrease in population density over the studied years, and to crayfish seasonal moulting, respectively. A reliable estimate of pathogen prevalence in <b>American</b> <b>crayfish</b> populations thus requires repeated monitoring over years, preferably during the same season before the main period of crayfish moulting...|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} reasons for this decline is the {{introduction}} of the invasive North <b>American</b> signal <b>crayfish</b> (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii).

40|$|Abstract Five of {{the most}} common macrophytes from an {{aquaculture}} facility with high densities of the herbivorous Asian grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) were commonly unpalatable to three generalist consumers—grass carp and the native North <b>American</b> <b>crayfishes</b> Procambarus spiculifer and P. acutus. The rooted vascular plant Micranthemum umbrosum comprised 89 % of the total aboveground plant biomass and was unpalatable to all three consumers as fresh tissues, as homogenized pellets, and as crude extracts. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude extract from M. umbrosum led to four previously known compounds that each deterred feeding by at least one consumer: 3, 4, 5 -trimethoxyallylbenzene (1) and three lignoids: b-apopicropodophyllin (2); (j) -(3 S, 4 R, 6 S) - 3 -(3 0, 4 0 -methylenedioxya-hydroxybenzyl) - 4 -(3 00, 4 00 -dimethoxybenzyl) butyrolactone (3); and (j) -hibalactone (4).

Moderate levels of infection were observed in some populations of O. limosus and P. leniusculus. Positive results were also obtained for E. sinensis and two Dutch populations of O. cf. virilis. English population of the latter species was also found infected, confirming this taxon as another A. astaci carrier in European waters. In contrast, Dutch P. clarkii seem only sporadically infected, and the pathogen was not yet detected in P. cf. acutus.

40|$|AbstractThe {{population}} {{size of the}} native European crayfish species has greatly decreased {{in the last century}} due to the crayfish plague and replacement by imported species, the destruction of their habitats, overfishing and eutrophication. In the present paper, the activity behaviours of two European (Astacus astacus and A. leptodactylus) and two <b>American</b> <b>crayfish</b> species (Orconectes limosus and Pacifastacus leniusculus) of the family Astacidae are studied and compared. The four crayfish species are not exclusively active during the night. The day-activity of the <b>American</b> <b>crayfish</b> species P. leniusculus and O. limosus with 33 % and 22 % of their total activity was much higher than those of A. astacus (12 %) and A. leptodactylus (16 %). All species show a relative high activity at a water temperature of 4 °C. From measurements at 25 °C and 30 °C can be concluded that P. leniusculus and A. leptodactylus are better adapted to high temperatures than A. astacus and O. limosus. At 20 °C the covered distance by the four species was calculated from the activity time and running speed. A. leptodactylus covers a distance of about 1600 m per day. In constrast, the distance covered by P. leniusculus is only 200 m. Thirteen biological parameters, including the findings in the activity behaviour, are summarized and discussed as an attempt to describe the causes and mechanisms of species replacement...|$|E

Taylor Abstract: Environmental change, including that caused {{directly or indirectly}} by invasive species, presents {{a major threat to}} the persistence of native freshwater biodiversity. The invasive <b>American</b> signal <b>crayfish</b> (Pacifastacus leniusculus (Dana, 1852)) has recently been implicated in the collapse of a pair of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L., 1758) species in Enos Lake, British Columbia, through introgressive hybridization; yet there are few data describing potential interactions between crayfish and these recently evolved stickleback species. We conducted a behavioural study, using an intact sympatric G. aculeatus species pair from a nearby lake, to examine if and how interactions with P. leniusculus may influence the breeding behaviour of sticklebacks. We found that {{the reproductive}} behaviour of limnetic males was disrupted to a greater degree than that of benthic males, suggesting that crayfish may disproportionately impact limnetic male reproductive success and may have contributed to biased hybridization between the Enos Lake species pair. Our study illustrates how newly differentiated taxa may be especially susceptible to environmental perturbations, particularly those caused by invasive species.
