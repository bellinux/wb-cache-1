5|$|After 1700 British {{continental}} {{policy was}} to contain expansion by competing powers such as France and Spain. Although Spain was the dominant global power {{during the previous}} two centuries and the chief threat to England's early transatlantic ambitions, its influence was now waning. The territorial <b>ambitions</b> <b>of</b> the French, however, led to the War of the Spanish Succession and the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the war, Himmler {{intensified}} the activity of the SS within Germany and in Nazi occupied Europe. An increasing numbers of Jews and German citizens deemed politically suspect or social outsiders were arrested. As the Nazi regime became more oppressive, the concentration camp system grew in size and lethal operation, and grew in scope as the economic <b>ambitions</b> <b>of</b> the SS intensified.|$|E

50|$|In {{discussing}} {{the transition from}} the Republic to the Empire, he suggested that if Caesar and Pompey had not worked to usurp the government of the Republic, other men would have risen in their place. The cause was not the <b>ambition</b> <b>of</b> Caesar or Pompey, but the <b>ambition</b> <b>of</b> man.|$|R
5|$|Thwarted in the east, Attalus {{now turned}} his {{attention}} westward. Perhaps because {{of concern for the}} <b>ambitions</b> <b>of</b> Philip V of Macedon, Attalus had sometime before 219BC become allied with Philip's enemies the Aetolian League, a union of Greek states in Aetolia in central Greece, having funded the fortification of Elaeus, an Aetolian stronghold in Calydonia, near the mouth of the river Acheloos.|$|E
5|$|A {{coalition}} Government of National Union {{was installed}} {{in the capital of}} Vientiane, but it soon ran into difficulties. By the 2 October 1962 deadline for the removal of foreign troops, the North Vietnamese had pulled out only 40 personnel, leaving approximately 6,000 troops in the eastern half of the country. Meanwhile, rightist elements (in control of the army) opposed the new government. The U.S. played its part by increasing its assistance to the right by covertly supplying the army through Thailand. Despite another international accord, Laos remained ensnared by the political and territorial <b>ambitions</b> <b>of</b> communist neighbors, the security concerns of Thailand and the United States, and geographic fate.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} grew, the hotels {{reflected}} <b>ambitions</b> <b>of</b> the strong economy, {{as evidenced by}} the eleven-story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in 1927. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, the Lamar Hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building. In 1988 it was listed as a Mississippi Landmark. The E.F. Young Hotel was built in 1931. A staple in the African-American business district that developed west of the city's core, the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room.|$|E

5|$|Born in Harlow, England, Murphy {{began playing}} snooker {{at the age}} of eight after his parents bought him a snooker table for Christmas. He made his first century break {{at the age of}} 10 and practised at the Rushden Snooker Centre, where players such as Stephen Hendry, Mark Williams, and Ken Doherty have also played. At the age of 13, he secured a five-year £5,000-a-year {{sponsorship}} deal with the Doc Martens shoe company and stated his <b>ambitions</b> <b>of</b> winning the World Championship and becoming world number one. He turned professional in 1998 at the age of 15.|$|E
5|$|Elected in 1901 to the Senate, Neild was a {{vigorous}} supporter of old-age pensions, {{free trade and}} several other causes, but his <b>ambitions</b> <b>of</b> promotion were never realised. Passionately loyal to the British Empire, he questioned aspects of the White Australia policy and spoke {{in support of the}} children of Kanaka labourers facing deportation. His continued disputes with the military, including an attempt to have the commander of the Australian military forces found in contempt of Parliament, saw him lose respect among his colleagues and his later career was spent in comparative isolation. He lost his seat in 1910 and died the following year.|$|E
5|$|He {{lived on}} for four more years, {{spending}} {{his days in}} his palace gardens. He saw his tetrarchic system fail, torn by the selfish <b>ambitions</b> <b>of</b> his successors. He heard of Maximian's third claim to the throne, his forced suicide, his damnatio memoriae. In his own palace, statues and portraits of his former companion emperor were torn down and destroyed. Deep in despair and illness, Diocletian may have committed suicide. He died on 3 December 312.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{grew up and}} {{was educated}} in the East Midlands, where he {{qualified}} as an engineer. A sportsman, Johnson broke his collarbone while playing rugby, an injury that later complicated his <b>ambitions</b> <b>of</b> becoming a fighter pilot. Johnson had been interested in aviation since his youth and applied to join the RAF. He was initially rejected, first on social, and then on medical grounds; he was eventually accepted in August 1939. The injury problems, however, returned during his early training and flying career, resulting in him missing the Battle of France and the Battle of Britain between May and October 1940.|$|E
5|$|More {{recent studies}} however suggest that Eutharic's Amali ancestry {{may have been}} a {{deliberate}} invention on the part of Theoderic to aid his <b>ambitions</b> <b>of</b> establishing dynastic credibility. According to Gesta Theoderici Eutharic belonged to the Gothic house of Alan rather than the house of Amal. Whilst Jordanes, in his history of the Goths, does make reference to Eutharic's prudentia et virtus, or pride and valour, this too {{may have been a}} fabrication on the part of Theoderic. Those qualities were recognised as requirements of Gothic ethnographic ideology, expressed in their code of civilitas. It would have been highly beneficial for Theoderic's chosen son-in-law to possess them.|$|E
5|$|Ray's {{international}} career {{started in}} earnest after {{the success of}} his next film, Aparajito (The Unvanquished). This film shows the eternal struggle between the <b>ambitions</b> <b>of</b> a young man, Apu, and the mother who loves him. Critics such as Mrinal Sen and Ritwik Ghatak rank it higher than Ray's first film. Aparajito won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, bringing Ray considerable acclaim. Before completing The Apu Trilogy, Ray directed and released two other films: the comic Parash Pathar (The Philosopher's Stone), and Jalsaghar (The Music Room), a film about the decadence of the Zamindars, considered one of his most important works.|$|E

5|$|The Chilean Civil War (1891), {{rather than}} calming the naval <b>ambitions</b> <b>of</b> Chile, {{escalated}} them. In that conflict, the Chilean Navy {{played a significant}} role on the congressional side against the president and the army. The resulting victory of the congressional side and subsequent presidency of Admiral Jorge Montt led to a large increase in prestige and consequent funding for the navy. Argentine naval units assisted failed revolts in Argentina, but the continuing acrimony with and naval acquisitions of Chile meant this had little effect.|$|E
5|$|The first {{challenge}} to Edwin came {{soon after his}} marriage-alliance with Kent, concluded at Canterbury {{in the summer of}} 625. By offering his protection to lesser kings, such as the king of Wight, Edwin thwarted the <b>ambitions</b> <b>of</b> Cwichelm of Wessex. Cwichelm's response was to send an assassin, as noted already. Edwin did not immediately respond to this insult, suggesting either that he felt unable to do so, or that Bede's portrayal of him as a rather indecisive ruler is accurate. Following the failed assassination, as noted, Edwin committed himself to Christianity provided only that he was victorious against Cwichelm.|$|E
5|$|The play also {{features}} an ambiguous and multifaceted portrayal of scientific knowledge, celebrating it for its humanistic achievements and discoveries, but also warning {{that it can}} do immense harm when {{in the hands of}} the unethical or overambitious. Given these themes, the play is likely Verne's most purely science-fictional work. Structurally, the play evokes the three-part design of Jacques Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which the hero must choose between love and art. In Journey Through the Impossible, however, the choice is between positive ideals—love, goodness, happiness—and the unbounded scientific <b>ambitions</b> <b>of</b> the sinister Doctor Ox.|$|E

5|$|This British Empire victory, {{the first}} against the Ottoman Empire in the war, ensured {{the safety of}} the Suez Canal from ground attacks, and ended the Central Powers' <b>ambitions</b> <b>of</b> disrupting traffic through the canal by gaining control of the {{strategically}} important northern approaches to the Suez Canal. The pursuit by the Anzac Mounted Division which ended at Bir el Abd on 12 August began the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Thereafter, the Anzac Mounted Division supported by the Imperial Camel Brigade were on the offensive, pursuing the German and Ottoman army many miles across the Sinai Peninsula, reversing in a most emphatic manner the defeat suffered at Katia three months earlier.|$|E
5|$|Watkin {{continued}} to harbour <b>ambitions</b> <b>of</b> linking his railway {{companies in the}} north and south of England, and while the construction of the Rickmansworth extension was underway planned two possible routes north from Rickmansworth across the Chilterns. One proposal envisaged the MR taking over or reaching agreement with the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway, building a link between Rickmansworth and Aylesbury, and running over the A's line to the north. The A had close relations with the Great Western Railway, with whom they shared a station at Aylesbury. Watkin felt it possible that the A would reach agreement with the GWR instead and not cooperate with the MR.|$|E
5|$|A {{successful}} {{invasion of}} Egypt would have several further advantages for the Byzantine Empire. Egypt {{was a rich}} province, and {{in the days of}} the Roman Empire it had supplied much of the grain for Constantinople before it was lost to the Arabs in the 7th century. The revenues that the Empire could have expected to gain from the conquest of Egypt would have been considerable, even if these would have to be shared with the Crusaders. Furthermore, Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric's plans, not only to deflect the <b>ambitions</b> <b>of</b> the Latins away from Antioch, but also to create new opportunities for joint military ventures that would keep the King of Jerusalem in his debt, and would also allow the Empire to share in territorial gains.|$|E
