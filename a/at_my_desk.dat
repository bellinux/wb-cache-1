It wasn't that I believed I {{could make it}} work, but I thought that at least I could explain why it didn’t work. Suddenly I had this incredible revelation. I realised that, the Kolyvagin–Flach method wasn't working, {{but it was all}} I needed to make my original Iwasawa theory work from three years earlier. So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant. I couldn't understand how I'd missed it and I just stared at it in disbelief for twenty minutes. Then during the day I walked around the department, and I'd keep coming back to my desk looking {{to see if it was}} still there. It was still there. I couldn't contain myself, I was so excited. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I ever do again will mean as much." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 5, 2013, {{media reports}} documenting the {{existence}} and functions of classified surveillance programs and their scope began and continued throughout the entire year. The first program to be revealed was PRISM, which allows for court-approved direct access to Americans' Google and Yahoo accounts, reported from both The Washington Post and The Guardian published one hour apart. Barton Gellman of The Washington Post was the first journalist to report on Snowden's documents. He said the U.S. government urged him not to specify by name which companies were involved, but Gellman decided that to name them [...] "would make it real to Americans." [...] Reports also revealed details of Tempora, a British black-ops surveillance program run by the NSA's British partner, GCHQ. The initial reports included details about NSA call database, Boundless Informant, and of a secret court order requiring Verizon to hand the NSA millions of Americans' phone records daily, the surveillance of French citizens' phone and Internet records, and those of [...] "high-profile individuals {{from the world of}} business or politics." [...] XKeyscore, an analytical tool that allows for collection of [...] "almost anything done on the internet," [...] was described by The Guardian as a program that shed light on one of Snowden's most controversial statements: [...] "I, sitting <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> [...] wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email." ...|$|E

60|$|She had {{gazed at}} the {{addressed}} envelope, smiled (I was looking up <b>at</b> her from <b>my</b> <b>desk),</b> and <b>at</b> last took it up with an effort of sanctimonious repugnance.

60|$|The {{programme}} of my ranch {{life was}} as follows: Each morning, at eight-thirty, having been reading or correcting proofs in bed since four or five, I went to <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> Odds and ends of correspondence and notes occupied me till nine, and at nine sharp, invariably, I began my writing. By eleven, sometimes {{a few minutes}} earlier or later, my thousand words were finished. Another half-hour <b>at</b> cleaning up <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> and <b>my</b> day's work was done, so that at eleven-thirty I got into a hammock under the trees with my mail-bag and the morning newspaper. At twelve-thirty I ate dinner and in the afternoon I swam and rode.|$|R

40|$|On {{an early}} fall day in September 1962 I sat quietly, thoughtfully, <b>at</b> <b>my</b> large <b>desk</b> {{in a newly}} renovated corner office in the old Crane wing of the Lillie Building, Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Looking out through high, ancient windows, I could see the busy main street of Woods Hole in the foreground, Martha's Vineyard beyond, behind me the MBL Stone Candle House, across the street the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and to the far right, the Biological Laboratory of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (BCF) (Fig. 1). Down the inner hall from my office {{stretched}} renovated quarters for the fledgling, ongoing, year-round MBL Systematics-Ecology Program (SEP), which I {{had been invited to}} direct...|$|R
500|$|Lowell {{returned}} to the United States and began his duties at Harvard {{in the summer of}} 1856. Still grieving the loss of his wife, however, he avoided Elmwood, lodging instead in an area known as Professors' Row on Kirkland Street in Cambridge along with his daughter Mabel and her governess Frances Dunlap. Lowell and Dunlap married in 1857. After the death of Lowell's father in January 1861 due to a heart attack, he moved back to Elmwood with his family. Despite avoiding the home for so long, he was pleased to be back. He wrote to his friend Charles Frederick Briggs: [...] "I am back again to the place I love best. I am sitting in <b>my</b> old garret, <b>at</b> <b>my</b> old <b>desk,</b> smoking <b>my</b> old pipe... I begin to feel more like my old self than I have these ten years". However, Elmwood's expenses drained him, with taxes at $1,000 a year. As early as 1867, he considered renting out Elmwood and moving into a smaller home elsewhere but never did. Instead, to ease his financial plight, he began to sell off land in 1870 until only two and a half acres remained.|$|R

60|$|May 5.--A moist rainy day, mild, however, and {{promising}} good weather. I sat <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> the whole day, {{and worked at}} Gillies's review. So was the day exhausted.|$|E
5000|$|Li Shuang {{was born}} in Beijing in 1957. Both of her parents were sophisticatedly educated and {{graduated}} for Beijing University, {{one of the top}} institutions in China. During her childhood, she was majorly influenced by her grandfather, an antiques, books and art works trader who traveled between Asian and Western countries. However, after the Cultural Revolution took place in Beijing, her family was deteriorated by the “Red Army”. She recalled” It was a cold winter <b>at</b> <b>my</b> age of 13, I was sitting on a square chair in the house, staring <b>at</b> <b>my</b> father’s working <b>desk.</b> He has been imprisoned and interrogated by the local academy for 3 months because of his storage of foreign literature and art work. All the possessions were confiscated and the house filled with emptiness and solitary. I wanted to draw the table on a paper, as if my father was using it to read and write. Since then, I picked up the brush and stepped on the path of drawing, even until now.” ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{left him}} there {{to go back}} to my room the steward was {{finishing}} dusting. I sent for the mate and engaged him in some insignificant conversation. It was, as it were, trifling with the terrific character of his whiskers; but my object was to give him an opportunity for a good look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> cabin. And then I could at last shut, with a clear conscience, the door of my stateroom and get my double back into the recessed part. There was nothing else for it. He had to sit still on a small folding stool, half smothered by the heavy coats hanging there. We listened to the steward going into the bathroom out of the saloon, filling the water bottles there, scrubbing the bath, setting things to rights, whisk, bang, clatter--out again into the saloon--turn the key--click. Such was my scheme for keeping my second self invisible. Nothing better could be contrived under the circumstances. And there we sat; I <b>at</b> <b>my</b> writing <b>desk</b> ready to appear busy with some papers, he behind me out of sight of the door. It would not have been prudent to talk in daytime; and I could not have stood the excitement of that queer sense of whispering to myself. Now and then, glancing over my shoulder, I saw him far back there, sitting rigidly on the low stool, his bare feet close together, his arms folded, his head hanging on his breast--and perfectly still. Anybody would have taken him for me.|$|R
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1857, The Atlantic Monthly was established, and Lowell was its first editor. With its first issue in November of that year, he at once gave the {{magazine}} the stamp of high literature and of bold speech on public affairs. In January 1861, Lowell's father {{died of a heart}} attack, inspiring Lowell to move his family back to Elmwood. As he wrote to his friend Briggs, [...] "I am back again to the place I love best. I am sitting in <b>my</b> old garret, <b>at</b> <b>my</b> old <b>desk,</b> smoking <b>my</b> old pipe... I begin to feel more like my old self than I have these ten years." [...] Shortly thereafter, in May, he left The Atlantic Monthly when James Thomas Fields took over as editor; the magazine had been purchased by Ticknor and Fields for $10,000 two years before. Lowell returned to Elmwood by January 1861 but maintained an amicable relationship with the new owners of the journal, continuing to submit his poetry and prose {{for the rest of his}} life. His prose, however, was more abundantly presented in the pages of the North American Review during the years 1862–1872. For the Review, he served as a coeditor along with Charles Eliot Norton. Lowell's reviews for the journal covered a wide variety of literary releases of the day, though he was writing fewer poems.|$|R
60|$|I write shortly, after a day's work <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> {{rather than}} lose a post in {{answering}} your enthusiastic, earnest, and young--how young, {{in all the}} best side of youth--letter.|$|E

6000|$|... "Good-by, Mr. Dishart," [...] I said abruptly. I {{then looked}} <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> which {{contained}} some trifles {{that were once}} Margaret's. [...] "Should anything happen to me," [...] I said, [...] "I want that old desk to be destroyed unopened." ...|$|E

60|$|When {{my letter}} was {{finished}} I sealed {{it up and}} locked it away in <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> with a smile <b>at</b> <b>my</b> middle-aged folly. What, I wondered, would all my sedate, serious friends, my associates of mission and hospital committees think if they knew. Well, everybody has, or should have, a pet nonsense in her life. I did not think mine was any sillier than some others I knew, and to myself I admitted {{that it was very}} sweet. I knew if those letters ceased to come all savour would go out of my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir," [...] said she, rising. There was {{gratitude}} both in {{her voice}} and in the look with which she accompanied it. It was time, indeed, for our conference to terminate; for, when I glanced around, behold all the boarders (the day-scholars had departed) were congregated within a yard or two of <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> and stood staring with eyes and mouths wide open; the three maitresses formed a whispering knot in one corner, and, close <b>at</b> <b>my</b> elbow, was the directress, sitting on a low chair, calmly clipping the tassels of her finished purse.|$|R
60|$|I {{went into}} my study, on the ground-floor, and took the chair <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> The {{photograph}} still lay where I had left it. The pillar of mist floated round the table, and stopped opposite to me, behind the photograph.|$|E
60|$|Isabel {{came after}} dinner one evening and talked in the office. She made a white-robed, dusky figure against the deep blues of my big window. I sat <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> and tore a quill pen to pieces as I talked.|$|E
60|$|So the {{old days}} were over! I looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> and {{by the side of}} it was the chair in which she used {{sometimes}} to sit while I read to her. Then I think that I, too, was glad that this change was to come.|$|E
6000|$|She was {{the first}} to recover, holding his face in her hands, turned towards the moonlight, her own in passionate shadow. [...] "Listen," [...] she said quickly.

I did come to look for something--not in <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> but yours." ...|$|R

60|$|One morning, at eleven-thirty, before I {{got into}} the hammock, I took a cocktail.

60|$|Mv {{work began}} to suffer. It {{was not the}} pain and burden {{to me that it}} had been. I often whistled <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> and wrote with far more fluency than before.
