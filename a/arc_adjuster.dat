50|$|The galire is a one-string {{instrument}} of the Jola of Thionck-Essyl, with its strings stretched across a single 1 meter curve made of fine mangrove wood. At first sight, {{it looks like a}} hunter's bow. It's played with one hand holding a flexible fine string (made of palm leaves) beating on the arc's string, while the other hand holds one end of the <b>arc</b> and <b>adjusts</b> the tune with the thumb. The other end of the arc rests in the mouth of the player, who sings. The vibration from the player's song on the string of the arc and the beating with the fine flexible string leads to the pleasant and characteristic sound of the galire.|$|R
25|$|Depressing {{carriages}} {{had been}} invented before – in the 15th century, a German engineer had devised {{a platform for}} a culverin that had four wheels and could be moved in two <b>arcs</b> for <b>adjusting</b> the elevation – but Koehler found a simple and effective solution that solved both the problems of elevation and recoil. It {{was based on an}} existing garrison carriage, a type of heavy gun carriage mounted on small wheels known as trucks. Koehler split the carriage in two horizontally, joining the two parts with a hinge created with a spindle at the front. This allowed the gun to be depressed to an angle of between 20 and 70 degrees. The cannonball and powder were held in place using wadding to secure them in the bore.|$|R

40|$|Inference in Bayesian {{networks}} is used {{to calculate}} the posterior probability distributions of unobserved variables in a network. These posterior probability distributions are used to draw conclusions and are the basis for decisions, in the domain of a particular model. Inference is a complex process and can be difficult to understand for even the most experienced Bayesian network users. In this thesis, we propose a technique to visualize important aspects of a Bayesian network, {{in order to make the}} process of inference more insightful. This technique consists of augmenting the visual representation of a Bayesian network with extra information. The only function of arcs in a Bayesian network is to indicate the relationships among the variables. We have used the arcs in a Bayesian network to show additional information: (1) the thickness of an <b>arc</b> is automatically <b>adjusted</b> to represent the strength of influence between two directly connected nodes and (2) the color of an <b>arc</b> is automatically <b>adjusted</b> to indicate the sign of influence between two directly connected nodes. Our technique does this in a novel, dynamic way, which is context-specific and takes into account any indirect influences. We have implemented our technique and integrated it into a software package called GeNIe, which can be used for developing Bayesian networks and is developed at the Decision Systems Laboratory of the University of Pittsburgh. A qualitative empirical evaluation showed that our technique and implementation are easy to use and understand and give a user more insight into a particular Bayesian network. ii...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we present}} an intensity-modulated {{radiotherapy}} technique based on forward planning dose calculations {{to provide a}} concave dose distribution to the prostate and seminal vesicles by means of modified dynamic arc therapy (M-DAT). Dynamic arcs (350 degrees) conforming to the beam’s eye view of the prostate and seminal vesicles while shielding the rectum, combined with two lateral oblique conformal fields (15 degrees with respect to laterals) fitting the prostate only, were applied to deliver doses of 78 Gy and 61. 23 Gy in 39 fractions to the prostate and seminal vesicles respectively. Dynamic wedges (45 degrees of thick end, anteriorly oriented) were used with conformal beams to adjust the dose homogeneity to the prostate, although in some cases, hard wedges (30 degrees of thick part, inferiorly oriented) were used with <b>arcs</b> to <b>adjust</b> the dose coverage to the seminal vesicles. The M-DAT was applied to 10 patients in supine and 10 patients in prone positioning to determine the proper patient positioning for optimum protection of the rectum.

500|$|When facing enemies, {{the player}} can either use melee and combo attacks {{at close range}} to take out foes or can opt to use weapons. Melee attacks {{comprise}} a variety of single punches, while combo attacks are activated through specific sequences of button presses that, when timed correctly, offer much greater damage; the most damaging {{of these is the}} specific [...] "brutal combo", which forces enemies to drop twice the ammunition they would normally leave. Nate can only carry one pistol and one rifle at a time, and there is a limited amount of ammunition per gun. Picking up a different firearm switches that weapon for the new one. Grenades are also available at certain points, and the height of the aiming <b>arc</b> is <b>adjusted</b> by tilting the Sixaxis controller up or down. These third-person perspective elements were compared by several reviewers to Gears of War, in that the player can have Drake take cover behind walls, and use either blind fire or aimed fire to kill enemies. In common with the aforementioned game, Uncharted lacks an actual on-screen health bar; instead, when the player takes damage, the graphics begin to lose color. While resting or taking cover for a brief period, Drake's health level, indicated by the screen color, returns to normal.|$|R
40|$|A {{plasma arc}} welding process for welding metal of {{increased}} thickness with one pass includes operating the {{plasma arc welding}} apparatus at a selected plasma gas flow rate, travel speed and arc current, to form a weld having a penetration ratio to weld height to weld width, and maintaining the penetration ratio at less than 0. 74. Parameters for the plasma gas flow rate, travel speed and <b>arc</b> current are <b>adjusted</b> to a steady state condition during a start up period and maintained during the steady state condition to complete a weld. During a terminal stopping period, the travel speed is stopped and instantaneously replaced by filler wire which adds material to fill the keyhole that had been formed by the welding process.

40|$|Approximately 2000 GEOS- 3 {{altimeter}} arcs {{were analyzed}} to improve {{knowledge of the}} geoid and gravity field. An adjustment procedure was used to fit the sea surface heights (geoid undulations) in an adjustment process that incorporated cross-over constraints. The error model used for the fit was a one or two parameter model {{which was designed to}} remove altimeter bias and orbit error. The undulations on the <b>adjusted</b> <b>arcs</b> were used to produce geoid maps in 20 regions.

40|$|Though many {{consider}} {{the magnitude of}} respiratory sinus arrhythmia as an index of cardiac vagal control, its physiological origins remain unclear. One influential model postulates that the systolic pressure rise within a given beat stimulates the baroreflex <b>arc</b> to <b>adjust</b> the following heart period such that diastolic pressure is “stabilized” and hence displays lesser fluctuation. Accordingly, the magnitude of diastolic pressure fluctuations with respiration should change reciprocally after augmentation or inhibition of respiratory sinus arrhythmia. To test this, we augmented and subsequently inhibited respiratory sinus arrhythmia with vagotonic and vagolytic atropine administration in 19 healthy young volunteers to assess the relation between respiratory R-R interval and diastolic pressure fluctuations. Respiratory diastolic pressure fluctuations showed parallel rather than inverse changes in relation to those in respiratory sinus arrhythmia: they increased with augmented respiratory sinus arrhythmia (138 and 190 % of baseline in the frequency and time domains, both P 60 % {{of the change in}} diastolic pressure fluctuations was explained by the change in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (R 2 = 0. 62; P < 0. 001), that is, an ∼ 50 -ms increase or decrease in respiratory sinus arrhythmia resulted in a parallel ∼ 1 -mmHg change in diastolic pressure fluctuations. Thus, in young healthy individuals during supine rest, respiratory fluctuations in R-R interval do not buffer against diastolic pressure fluctuations but actually cause diastolic pressure fluctuations. Therefore, our data provide little evidence for a predominant role of a baroreflex feedback mechanism underlying respiratory sinus arrhythmia during supine rest...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere {{is a lot}} of {{excitement}} in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) at the moment centering around the ideas of “connectionism”. Connections networks are used to represent knowledge in terms of “subsymbolic” nodes (i. e. a single node does not by itself represent a conceptual entity, such as a dog, apple, Mary; any node may participate in a number of patterns of activation and each such pattern is a representation of a conceptual entity). The edges of these networks are arcs, with an associated numeric weight, whose role is to transfer “activity” from one node to another according to some function of the arc weights. The phenomenon of learning is typically modeled by <b>adjusting</b> <b>arc</b> weights according to some function of the network's desired and observed perfomance. The connectionist paradigm is seen as a promising new approach to the realization of intelligent systems, and one that may be particularly amenable to formal analysis. This paper introduces connectionism, points out some of the major problems and argues that a graph theoretical approach to some of the recognized problems may prove fruitful...|$|R
40|$|Self-fluxing NiCrBSi {{and related}} {{coatings}} received considerable interest {{due to their}} good wear as well as corrosion resistance at moderate and elevated temperatures. Hard tungsten carbide (WC) particles can be included in NiCrBSi for further increase of the coating hardness and abrasive wear resistance. Flame spray technique is widely used for fabrication of NiCrBSi films. However, in such a case, subsequent remelting of the deposited coatings by flame, arc discharge or high power laser beam is necessary. In present study NiCrBSi-WC/Co coatings were formed using plasma transferred <b>arc</b> process. By <b>adjusting</b> plasma parameters, such as current, plasma gas flow, shielding gas flow, a number of coatings were formed on steel substrates. Structure of the coatings was investigated using X-ray diffractometry. Microstructure of cross-sectioned coatings was examined using scanning electron microscopy. Hardness of the coating was evaluated {{by means of the}} Vickers hardness tests. Wear tests were also performed on specimens to determine resistance to abrasive wear. Acquired results allowed estimating the influence of the deposition process parameters on structure and mechanical properties of the coatings. [URL] </p...|$|R
40|$|We study {{sequential}} interdiction {{when the}} interdictor has incomplete initial {{information about the}} network, and the evader has complete knowledge of the network, including its structure and arc costs. In each time period, the interdictor blocks at most k arcs from the network observed up to that period, after which the evader travels along a shortest path between two (fixed) nodes in the interdicted network. By observing the evader’s actions, the interdictor learns about the network structure and <b>arc</b> costs, and <b>adjusts</b> its actions so as to maximize the cumulative cost incurred by the evader. A salient feature of our work is that the feedback in each period is deterministic and adversarial. In addition to studying the regret minimization problem, we also discuss time-stability of a policy, which {{is the number of}} time periods until the interdictor’s actions match those of an oracle interdictor with prior knowledge of the network. We propose a class of simple interdiction policies that have a finite regret and detect when the instantaneous regret reaches zero in real time. More importantly, we establish that this class of policies belongs to the set of efficient policies...|$|R
30|$|For the FRAP {{measurements}} {{the samples}} {{were placed on the}} stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX 70) of a Delta Vision System (Applied Precision, Isaquah, USA) equipped with a mercury arc lamp (Mercury Short Arc, HBO, Osram) providing epi-illumination and a Cool Snap HQ CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, USA). The illumination profile of the mercury <b>arc</b> lamp was <b>adjusted</b> to be as homogeneous as possible over the entire field of view (1024 × 1024 pixel). Bleaching during recovery was minimized by closing a shutter in between the acquisition of images. Several prebleaching images were acquired in order to correct for the nonuniform illumination profile. The excitation filter (490 / 20 nm) and the emission filter (528 / 38 nm) were selected for the use of fluorescein. Photobleaching was carried out by a short laser pulse of 30 ms duration provided by an optically pumped solid-state laser (OPSL, Sapphire 488 / 20, Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, USA) operated at 488 nm in the TEM 00 -mode which yields a radially symmetric, approximately Gaussian intensity profile. The laser power was set to 90 % of the maximum output power (20 mW). The laser source module is coupled to an optical fiber guiding the laser light to the microscope setup. The beam profile is expanded by coupling of the output fiber coupler to a telescope (beam expander), and thereafter focused close to the back focal plane of the objective (10 ×, NA= 1.2) in order to generate a cylindrically beam shape in the specimen. Low spatial resolution was chosen as optimal to avoid measuring effects arising from local inhomogeneities.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} integer {{balancing}} of a four-dimensional matrix is studied. The {{elements of the}} inner part (all four indices are greater than zero) of the given real matrix are summed in each direction and each two- and three-dimensional section of the matrix; the total sum is also found. These sums are placed into the elements where one or more indices are equal to zero (according to the summing directions). The problem is to find an integer matrix of the same structure, which can be produced from the initial one by replacing the elements with the largest previous or the smallest following integer. At the same time, the element with four zero indices should be produced with standard rules of rounding - off.

40|$|In {{the article}} {{the problem of}} ﬁnding the maximal {{multiple}} ﬂow in the network of any natural multiplicity k is studied. There are arcs of three types: ordinary arcs, multiple arcs and multi-arcs.  Each multiple and multi-arc is a union of k linked <b>arcs,</b> which are <b>adjusted</b> with each other. The network constructing rules are described. The deﬁnitions of a divisible network and some associated subjects are stated. The important property of the divisible network is that every divisible network can be partitioned into k parts, which are adjusted on the linked arcs of each multiple and multi-arc. Each part is the ordinary transportation network. The main results of the article are the following subclasses of the problem of ﬁnding the maximal multiple ﬂow in the divisible network. 1. The divisible networks with the multi-arc constraints. Assume that only one vertex is the ending vertex for a multi-arc in k − 1  network parts. In this case the problem can be solved in a polynomial time. 2. The divisible networks with the weak multi-arc constraints. Assume that only one vertex is the ending vertex for a multi-arc in s network parts (1 ≤ s < k − 1) and other parts {{have at least two}} such vertices. In that case the multiplicity of the multiple ﬂow problem can be decreased to k − s. 3. The divisible network of the parallel structure. Assume that the divisible network component, which consists of all multiple arcs, can be partitioned into subcomponents, each of them containing exactly one vertex-beginning of a multi-arc.  Suppose that intersection of each pair of subcomponents is the only vertex-network source x 0. If k = 2, the maximal ﬂow problem can be solved in a polynomial time. If k ≥ 3, the problem is NP-complete.  The algorithms for each polynomial subclass are suggested. Also, the multiplicity decreasing algorithm for the divisible network with weak multi-arc constraints is formulated. </p...|$|R
