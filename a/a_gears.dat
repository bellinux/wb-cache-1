40|$|Abstract: The {{surface of}} <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> with ring-involute teeth {{generated}} by a rack cutter with ring-involute teeth is {{a new type of}} gear. This paper describes a method developed from gear theory for deriving a pinion and <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> with ring-involute teeth. <b>A</b> <b>gear</b> with ring-involute teeth is regarded as an envelope to the family of rack cutter surfaces when the pinion and <b>gear</b> rotate for <b>a</b> cycle. Using a developed mathematical model, the investigation on the undercutting analysis of the proposed gear is studied. Here the kinematic errors are investigated according to the obtained geometric modelling of the designed gear meshing when assembly errors were present. Stress analysis for the proposed gear was performed.

50|$|Price {{consistency}} and whether some content {{should be available}} free of charge {{has also been a}} source of criticism related to the Xbox Live Marketplace. A notable incident was Microsoft charging for <b>a</b> <b>Gears</b> of War map pack that developer Epic desired to provide at no cost (although it was made free four months later in September 2007). Exacerbating the controversy, Game Informer made claims that Microsoft forced companies to charge for content the company itself wanted to distribute free. In this case, Microsoft Publishing was responsible for setting the price, with this not actually being a policy of the Xbox team or Xbox Live Marketplace as was implied. Free content is indeed possible, but much of the free content is promotional in nature, such as the titles Yaris and Dash of Destruction..|$|E
