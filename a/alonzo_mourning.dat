5|$|The team earned three {{consecutive}} Ivy League championships during his career, including an undefeated conference record during his senior season. Despite the team's success and his individual accolades, his Princeton tenure was punctuated by three NCAA Tournament first round losses by {{a total of}} seven points, most notably the March 17, 1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament first round 5049 loss to the number-one seeded Georgetown Hoyas team featuring <b>Alonzo</b> <b>Mourning</b> and Dikembe Mutombo as well as 1989 Big East Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year Charles Smith.|$|E
5|$|The men's {{basketball}} team is particularly noteworthy as it won the NCAA championship in 1984 under coach John Thompson. The current coach is Georgetown alumnus Patrick Ewing, {{who played in}} three Final Fours under coach Thompson from 1982 to 1985. The team is tied for the most Big East conference tournament titles with seven, and has made twenty-seven NCAA tournament appearances.

5|$|Babcock's {{first move}} as GM was {{drafting}} centre Rafael Araújo—selected eighth overall—in the 2004 NBA draft, {{in a move}} that was criticized by fans and analysts, considering highly touted swingman Andre Iguodala was drafted with the next pick. Babcock signed point guard Rafer Alston to a five-year deal. After Vince Carter's annual charity game, Babcock implicitly revealed to the media that Carter's agent had asked for a trade, confirming Carter's discontent. The Toronto Sun reported that Carter felt he was being misled by the Raptors' hierarchy during the General Manager search and had concluded {{that as long as the}} managerial structure at Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd. remained intact, the Raptors would never be an elite team. Carter was finally traded mid-season, ending his six-year tenure. Toronto received <b>Alonzo</b> <b>Mourning,</b> forwards Eric Williams and Aaron Williams and two mid-to-late future first round picks from the New Jersey Nets. Mourning chose not to report to Toronto, forcing Babcock to buy out the remainder of his contract at a reported $10million, leaving him free to sign with the Miami Heat. Eric and Aaron Williams were supposed to add defensive toughness and rebounding, but were generally under-utilized for the entire season. Analysts had predicted Babcock got the bad end of the deal, and the trade eventually cost him his job.|$|E

25|$|The {{rivalry between}} the New York Knicks and the {{expansion}} Miami Heat {{was a result of}} their four consecutive playoff series from 1997 to 2000. Each series went seven games.

25|$|In the 2003 NBA draft, {{with the}} fifth overall pick, Miami {{selected}} shooting guard Dwyane Wade out of Marquette. Free-agent swing-man Lamar Odom was signed from the Los Angeles Clippers. Just {{prior to the}} start of the 2003–04 season, Riley stepped down as head coach to focus on rebuilding the Heat, promoting Stan Van Gundy to the position of head coach. Behind Van Gundy's leadership, Wade's stellar rookie year and Odom's break out season, the Heat made the 2004 NBA Playoffs, beating the New Orleans Hornets 4–3 in the 1st round and losing to the Indiana Pacers 4–2 in the 2nd round.

500|$|During the 1998–99 lockout, Falk {{was often}} {{described}} as the [...] "invisible hand" [...] that guided union negotiations. [...] The NBPA President during the lockout, Patrick Ewing, was a client of Falk's. [...] Falk was also the agent of [...] "nearly half" [...] of the union's 19-member negotiating committee, including <b>Alonzo</b> <b>Mourning,</b> Juwan Howard, and Dikembe Mutombo. [...] Though his presence in negotiations was already assumed, Falk publicly stated in an October 31, 1998 New York Times article that he would [...] "roll up his sleeves and exert as much influence as he (could) behind the scenes,... (planning) {{to take a more}} proactive role in ending the lockout." ...|$|E
500|$|Falk's {{enduring}} legacy {{can best}} be described as the NBA's new star-centered focus. [...] Falk's idea was that since most people bought Chicago Bulls tickets to see Michael Jordan, Jordan himself should get {{a large proportion of the}} benefit."Basketball is a hybrid between an individual and team sport", Falk is saying. [...] "Very gifted players almost make a team by themselves. In that environment, a Michael Jordan, <b>Alonzo</b> <b>Mourning,</b> Juwan Howard, Shaquille O'Neal and Patrick Ewing bring in the fans. Fans come to watch them play primarily. They create marketing opportunities, new stadiums, luxury boxes, and they should be paid a disproportionate amount of money. The salary structure should be close to what it is in Hollywood, where Jim Carrey makes $16 million a film and the second star makes $2 million. That's what I believe as an economics major and as a neo-capitalist." ...|$|E
500|$|Falk {{was one of}} the {{key figures}} in the 1995 NBA lockout. [...] The lockout {{originally}} occurred when the players wanted a soft salary cap, while the owners wanted a hard salary cap. [...] Falk led a rebellion on the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) by establishing a dissident faction of 16 players and a number of agents (including players Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, <b>Alonzo</b> <b>Mourning,</b> Reggie Miller, and fellow agents Marc Fleisher and Arn Tellem) that began advocating for NBPA decertification. [...] The goal was to strip NBA management of antitrust protection, making the salary cap and other forms of collective bargaining violations of antitrust laws, win a settlement in court, and then immediately re-form the Players' Union. NBA Commissioner David Stern criticized Falk's involvement in the negotiations, saying that he was [...] "trashing his own clients." [...] Kenny Gattison, the Charlotte Hornets' player representative, {{went so far as to}} blame the entire lockout on Falk.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 1992, {{even before his}} {{departure}} from ProServ, other NBA agents had begun acknowledging that Falk generally negotiated the contracts that defined the market for the year, and set the standard by which other agents were judged. [...] By {{the end of the}} 1995 NBA lockout, Falk controlled enough top players that he was seen as [...] "dictat(ing) the structure and the economics of the entire league," [...] so much so that during one six-day period in the summer of 1996, he negotiated six contracts—for Jordan, <b>Alonzo</b> <b>Mourning,</b> Juwan Howard, Kenny Anderson, Dikembe Mutombo and Lee Mayberry—worth more than $335 million. [...] Since Falk usually earned 4% of player contracts, which is the maximum amount allowed by the Players' Union, he made roughly $13 million for these 6 deals alone. [...] He was so successful at negotiating contracts that in 1998, just before he sold FAME to SFX Entertainment, the contracts of Falk's players totaled just under $800 million.|$|E
500|$|In September 2009, Wade donated {{money from}} his {{foundation}} to keep the Robbins, Illinois public library from having to shut down. He handed the library director Priscilla Coatney a $25,000 check in order to resurrect the building, which brought Coatney to tears. He called the donation a [...] "small contribution", and reminisced about the difficult experiences he faced as a child, stating that he sometimes {{did not know how}} he would find his next meal. In January 2010, Wade and <b>Alonzo</b> <b>Mourning</b> co-founded The Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti", which raised money to help the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In the three days since the fund began soliciting donations from athletes, Wade announced that the [...] "Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti" [...] had already raised over $800,000. Wade stated, [...] "I expected nothing less from my friends and colleagues in the sports community, our commitment to this cause knows no bounds, {{and we will continue to}} accept any and all donations throughout the days ahead." [...] Wade is also an avid supporter of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and has served as an Ambassador for their Hoops for St. Jude basketball initiative.|$|E
500|$|Duncan {{initially}} had difficulties {{adapting to}} the game he thought would help relieve his pain and frustration. Nancy Pomroy, the athletic director of the St. Croix Country Day School was quoted: [...] " [...] was so huge. So big and tall, but he was awfully awkward at the time." [...] He overcame this to become a standout for the St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School, averaging 25 points per game as a senior. His play {{attracted the attention of}} several universities, despite having only picked up the game in ninth grade. Wake Forest University basketball coach Dave Odom in particular grew interested in Duncan after the 16-year-old allegedly played NBA star <b>Alonzo</b> <b>Mourning</b> to a draw in a 5-on-5 pick-up game. Odom was searching for a tall, physical player to play near the basket. Given the weak level of basketball in the Virgin Islands, Odom was wary about Duncan at first, especially after first meeting him and thinking him to be inattentive; Duncan stared blankly at Odom for most of the conversation. However, after the first talk, Odom understood that this was just Duncan's way of paying attention, and discovered that he was not only athletically talented, but also a quick learner. Eventually, despite scholarship offers by the University of Hartford, the University of Delaware and Providence College, Duncan joined Odom's Wake Forest Demon Deacons.|$|E
