40|$|To {{assess the}} state of {{knowledge}} regarding the effectiveness of distribution system disinfectant residuals during <b>accidental</b> microbial <b>intrusions,</b> the authors reviewed laboratory-, pilot-, and full-scale experimental studies. The persistence of microorganisms in the biofilms of simulated mains at the laboratory scale was much longer than in pilot-scale settings, under the typical disinfectant residual concentrations used in distribution systems. Most of the studies reviewed used culture-based methods for the enumeration of microorganisms, which are known to underestimate the number and diversity of microorganisms. Because the distribution system is the last barrier between the treatment plant and the consumer, intrusion is of concern to utility managers. Conditions experienced during some repairs—zero- or low-flow conditions and/or delay in reinstatement of disinfection—are likely to be critical for the persistence of intruded microorganisms in the biofilm, a fact that {{underscores the importance of}} adequate chlorination and flushing procedures. For the research community, this review highlights the need for additional studies using methods (e. g. molecular tools) that allow the detection of viable but nonculturable microorganisms. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Technologies such as Ethernet and TCP/IP have made the interfacing of industrial equipment much easier, but there is now significantly less isolation from the outside world. Network security problems from the business network can be passed on to the process network, putting industrial production and human safety at risk. This paper evaluates these risks to industrial control systems from both <b>accidental</b> and malicious <b>intrusion.</b> The first portion summarizes an analysis of reported incidents in industrial environments and their effects on process systems. The second part describes a series of tests developed and conducted at the BCIT Internet Engineering Lab to determine possible security weaknesses in common programmable logic controllers.

40|$|Behavioral {{adjustments}} {{in response to}} the presence of landmarks can exert strong effects on population dynamics of territorial species as well as the evolution of behavior and social systems. Hence, an understanding of the role of landmarks in animal contests provides a link between behavioral decision-making and population dynamics, which has been viewed as a major goal in ecology. This dissertation investigates the effects of landmarks on territory defense, focusing on how landmarks affect differences in sex roles, the landscape of aggression and fundamental territory properties. To investigate these ideas, I used three different cichlid fish species as model systems. My results clearly demonstrate that landmarks have strong effects on territoriality of cichlid fish, and thus are likely to have been significant influences on the population dynamics and the evolution of the behavior. The laboratory experiments revealed that the resource-free space between territories can function as a visual landmark to reduce aggression between territorial neighbors. I found that male and female Neolamprologus multifasciatus, an African shell-brooding cichlid fish, respond differently to changes in defensive costs that arose {{as a result of the}} presence/absence of a buffer zone. Males were more sensitive to the effect of increased defensive costs, compared to females as males increased both the time spent in defense and the use of highly aggressive acts. This increased responsiveness of males could be partly due to males having stronger tendency to intrude when a buffer zone is absent. This study also suggests that, at least in some species, females’ contribution to territory defense may vary relatively little regardless of overall costs. Visual landmarks also influenced the landscape of aggression in Hypsophrys nicaraguensis, a Central American cichlid fish. Findings of this field study revealed that in the absence of landmarks fish left larger areas between each other, and these spaces may act as buffer zones. In addition, this work found that landmarks are useful in both precisely defining territory borders and allowing fish to interact at landmarks when such landmarks are available. These factors may have contributed to lower the overall defensive costs in several ways, by decreasing <b>accidental</b> <b>intrusions,</b> reducing risk of escalation, easily identifying when an intrusion is occurring, and spending less time in boundary patrolling. Landmarks also affected the fundamental territory properties such as territory size, shape and the location of boundaries in Amatitlania siquia territories. In this field study, I observed that territories were significantly smaller when landmarks were present. The reduced size was mainly driven by relocating the boundary closer to the landmark, with pairs giving up an area lacking a clearly defined boundary. This behavior suggests that it is beneficial to defend a smaller territory with well-defined boundaries compared to a larger territory with undefined territory borders. The willingness of fish to move the boundary closer to the nest also suggests that landmarked boundaries provide benefits substantial enough to overcome the cost of high predation on fry when the boundary is closer to the nest. In addition, with the presence of a linear landmark, territories were elongated. However, the presence of a point landmark did not alter territories’ optimal round shape. Findings of my dissertation will provide a means by which researchers will be able to manipulate territories and address fundamental questions about territory structure, territory function as well as the evolution of territoriality and its role in population dynamics. In addition to contributing to the knowledge base of territoriality, these results have important implications for wildlife managers and captive breeders as it suggests that providing landmarks maximizes space use and reduces aggression in territorial species...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy and its {{contractors}} are currently evaluating {{a site in}} Nevada (Yucca Mountain) for disposal of high-level radioactive waste from U. S. commercial nuclear plants and U. S. government-owned facilities. The suitability of the potential geologic repository is assessed, based on its performance in isolating the nuclear waste from the environment. Experimental data and models representing the natural and engineered barriers are combined into a Total System Performance Assessment (TSPA) model [1]. Process models included in the TSPA model are unsaturated zone flow and transport, thermal hydrology, in-drift geochemistry, waste package degradation, waste form degradation, engineered barrier system transport, saturated zone flow and transport, and biosphere transport. Because of the uncertainty in the current data {{and in the future}} evolution of the total system, simulations follow a probabilistic approach. Multiple realization simulations using Monte Carlo analysis are conducted over time periods of up to one million years, which estimates a range of possible behaviors of the repository. The environmental impact is measured primarily by the annual dose received by an average member of a critical population group residing 20 km down-gradient of the potential repository. In addition to the nominal scenario, other exposure scenarios include the possibility of disruptive events such as volcanic eruption or <b>intrusion,</b> or <b>accidental</b> human <b>intrusion.</b> Sensitivity to key uncertain processes is analyzed. The influence of stochastic variables on the TSPA model output is assessed by ''uncertainty importance analysis'', e. g., regression analysis and classification tree analysis. Further investigation of the impact of parameters and assumptions is conducted through ''one-off analysis'', which consists in fixing a parameter at a particular value, using an alternative conceptual model, or in making a different assumption. Finally, robustness analysis evaluates the performance of the repository when various natural or engineered barriers are assumed to be degraded. The objective of these analyses is to evaluate the performance of the potential repository system under conditions ranging from expected to highly unlikely though physically possible conditions...|$|R
