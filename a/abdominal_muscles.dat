40|$|<b>Abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> {{activity}} was studied in eight normal subjects, while seated and supine, during inspiratory resistive and elastic mechanical loading. Electromyograms {{of the external}} oblique and rectus abdominis muscle were recorded using unipolar needle electrodes and changes in antero-posterior dimensions of the abdomen (Vab) were measured using linearized magnetometers. Elastic loading evoked <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> activity during expiration, especially in the rectus abdominis, in seven seated subjects while resistive loading did so in five. In four runs {{activity was}} also detectable throughout inspiration. <b>Abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> activity {{was associated with a}} reduction in Vab throughout the respiratory cycle. When the subjects were supine loads did not evoke <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> activity. We conclude that <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> recruitment during inspiratory mechanical loading may facilitate inspiration by increasing diaphragmatic length.

50|$|An <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> strain, {{also called}} a pulled <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle,</b> is {{an injury to}} one of the <b>muscles</b> of the <b>abdominal</b> wall. A <b>muscle</b> strain occurs when the muscle is {{stretched}} too far. When this occurs the muscle fibers are torn. Most commonly, a strain causes microscopic tears within the muscle, but occasionally, in severe injuries, the muscle can rupture from its attachment.|$|R
5|$|Like other insects, {{grasshoppers}} {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} and their body cavities are filled with haemolymph. A heart-like structure in {{the upper part of}} the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange. Respiration is performed using tracheae, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of valved spiracles. Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscles</b> to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system.|$|E
5|$|Dragonfly nymphs vary in {{form with}} species and are loosely classed into claspers, sprawlers, hiders, and burrowers. The first instar {{is known as}} a prolarva, a {{relatively}} inactive stage from which it quickly moults into the more active nymphal form. The general body plan {{is similar to that of}} an adult, but the nymph lacks wings and reproductive organs. The lower jaw has a huge, extensible labium, armed with hooks and spines, which is used for catching prey. This labium is folded under the body at rest and struck out at great speed by hydraulic pressure created by the <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscles.</b> Whereas damselfly nymphs have three feathery external gills, dragonfly nymphs have internal gills, located around the fourth and fifth abdominal segments. Water is pumped in and out of the abdomen through an opening at the tip. The naiads of some clubtails (Gomphidae) that burrow into the sediment, have a snorkel-like tube at the end of the abdomen enabling them to draw in clean water while they are buried in mud. Naiads can forcefully expel a jet of water to propel themselves with great rapidity.|$|E
5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have {{calves and}} ankles that return and amplify the energy {{supplied}} by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscles</b> and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> structural adaptations and functional capabilities during pregnancy and the postbirth period. Subjects. Six primigravid subjects, aged 28 to 33 years, participated in nine test sessions from 14 weeks of gestation to 8 weeks postbirth. Methods. At each test session, three-dimensional photography of abdominal skin markers was used to determine the gross morphology of a representative <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle,</b> the rectus abdominis muscle. The functional capability of the <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> group was assessed on the ability of the muscle group to stabilize the pelvis against resistance. Results. Increases were found in rectus abdominis muscle separation width, length, and angles of insertion as pregnancy progressed. Reversal in rectus abdominis muscle separation was found by 4 weeks postbirth. The ability to stabilize the pelvis against resistance was shown to be decreased as pregnancy progressed and remained compromised postbirth. Decrements in <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> function paralleled in time the structural adaptations, as pregnancy progressed. Continued functional deficits were found in parallel with incomplete resolution of structural adaptations postbirth. Conclusion and Discussion. <b>Abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> function is affected by structural adaptations that occur during pregnancy. Because our results showed that the ability to stabilize the pelvis against resistance is decreased during pregnancy and at least 8 weeks postbirth, <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> exercises should be chosen with care...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{relationships}} between sprint running, jumping, throwing performances and <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> thickness. Subjects were 12 healthy young males (age: 18. 8 ± 0. 7 years, height: 166. 1 ± 5. 6 cm, weight: 61. 1 ± 6. 5 kg). They took 50 m run, standing broad jump, and handball throwing tests.

40|$|Inspiratory muscle {{weakness}} due to lung hyperinflation and muscle wasting may occur in cystic fibrosis. We therefore measured diaphragm function and bulk in 18 stable patients with cystic fibrosis and 15 matched control subjects; the <b>abdominal</b> and quadriceps <b>muscles</b> were studied for comparison. We assessed diaphragm mass, <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> thickness, twitch transdiaphragmatic and gastric pressures, quadriceps cross-section and isokinetic strength, and lean body mass. Lean body mass, quadriceps strength, and quadriceps cross-section were lower {{in patients with}} cystic fibrosis. Twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure was 23 % lower and twitch gastric pressure was 22 % greater in patients with cystic fibrosis than in control subjects, but diaphragm mass and <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> thickness were similar in the two groups. For any given lean body mass and quadriceps cross-section, patients with cystic fibrosis had greater diaphragm mass and <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> thickness. Diaphragm mass had greater intersubject variability in patients with cystic fibrosis than in control subjects. We conclude that diaphragm strength is decreased but <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> strength is increased in patients with cystic fibrosis. Diaphragm and <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> bulk are not affected by the general muscle wasting, which suggests {{that there may be}} a training effect of cystic fibrosis on respiratory muscles. However, the variability of diaphragm mass indicates that this beneficial response does not occur in all patients with cystic fibrosis. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The osteogenesis {{induction}} by demineralized {{bone matrix}} grafts remains {{as a challenge}} in the reconstructions of the mandible through homologous and xenografts or in implants in <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle.</b> PURPOSE: Observed the behaviour of implants of demineralized bone matrix at the mandible (right side with homologous graft and left side with xenograft of pig). METHODS: Experimental study with homologous and heterologous implants of demineralized bone matrix at the mandible and in ectopic muscle at the Center of Experimental Surgery of Heliopolis Hospital, Hosphel, São Paulo, Brazil. In 6 white New Zeland rabbits, 46 grafts were performed being 23 with homologous (rabbit) and 23 with xenograft (pig). 12 homologous implants (6 at {{the right side of}} the mandible and 6 at <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> of the rabbit) and 12 heterologous implants of pigs (6 at the left side of the mandible and 6 at <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscle</b> rabbit) were performed with demineralized bone matrix.

25|$|Breathing during {{locomotion}} {{has been}} studied in three species, and they show different patterns. Adult female green sea turtles do not breathe as they crutch along their nesting beaches. They hold their breath during terrestrial locomotion and breathe in bouts as they rest. North American box turtles breathe continuously during locomotion, and the ventilation cycle is not coordinated with the limb movements. This is because they use their <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscles</b> to breathe during locomotion. The last species to have been studied is the red-eared slider, which also breathes during locomotion, but takes smaller breaths during locomotion than during small pauses between locomotor bouts, indicating {{that there may be}} mechanical interference between the limb movements and the breathing apparatus. Box turtles have also been observed to breathe while completely sealed up inside their shells.|$|E
25|$|The wave-style breaststroke {{starts in}} a {{streamlined}} position, with shoulders shrugged to decrease drag in the water. While the conventional style is strongest at the outsweep, the wave-style puts {{much emphasis on}} the insweep, thus making the head rise later than in the conventional style. The wave-style pull is a circular motion with the hands accelerating to maximum speed and recovering {{in front of the}} chin, elbows staying at the surface and in front of the shoulders at all times. The high elbows creates the leverage for the powerful torso and <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscles</b> to assist in the stroke. During the insweep, the swimmer accelerates their hands and hollows their back and lifts themself out of the water to breathe. To visualize, some say that the hands anchor themselves in the water while the hips thrust forward.|$|E
25|$|The {{easiest way}} to breathe during breaststroke is to let the head follow the spine. When the swimmer's elbows have reached the line of his eye and have begun to rise, his head starts to lift. If he uses his high elbows as a hinge for the inward sweep {{of his hands and}} forearms, he will create the {{leverage}} he needs to use his <b>abdominal</b> <b>muscles</b> to bring his hips forward. When his hips move forward, his chest, shoulders and upper back will automatically lift up. Breathing is usually done during the beginning of the insweep phase of the arms, and the swimmer breathes in ideally through the mouth. The swimmer breathes out through mouth and nose during the recovery and gliding phase. Breaststroke can be swum faster if submerged completely, but FINA requires the head to break the surface once per cycle except for the first cycle after the start and each turn. Thus, competitive swimmers usually make one underwater pull-out, pushing the hands {{all the way to the}} back after the start and each turn.|$|E
