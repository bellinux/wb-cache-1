Trigon and Theta Tau dominated student government in the Engineering School during this time, often fielding competing candidates for student office.

5|$|It {{was during}} the first half of the twentieth century that the first women's fraternities were established. The {{university}} first admitted women to graduate programs in 1920, although undergraduate women were not allowed at the university until much later. With these graduate women came several female Greek organizations, referred to alternately as sororities or women's fraternities. The first sorority to establish a chapter at the university was Chi Omega, whose chapter was founded in 1927. A Kappa Delta chapter followed in 1932, and <b>a</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>of</b> Zeta Tau Alpha was established twenty years later in 1952.|$|E

When Rubin arrived at Rutgers on November 11, 1972, {{he learned that the}} first degree of ritual had been administered, which began formal probationary membership. Alpha Phi's charter was immediately revoked and their chapter was placed on suspension. On November 13, the former Alpha Phi chapter formally reorganized as Mu Upsilon Alpha.

Five fraternities currently operate an active chapter at the university; Pi Kappa Alpha, Omega Psi Phi, Lambda Phi Epsilon, Alpha Epsilon Pi and Phi Delta Theta and six Sororities including Tau Sigma Phi, Alpha Pi Phi, Epsilon Sigma Alpha, Delta Pi, Nu Omega Zeta, and Delta Psi Delta.|$|E
5|$|Wilton H. St Hill (6 July 1893 – c. 1957) was a West Indian cricketer {{who played}} in West Indies' first Test match during their inaugural Test tour of England. A {{right-handed}} batman {{who played in}} a variety of batting positions, he represented Trinidad in first-class cricket between 1912 and 1930 and played in three Test matches in total. Although his Test record was poor, he was highly regarded in Trinidad. In particular, writer C. L. R. James considered St Hill to be among the top batsmen in the world and dedicated <b>a</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>of</b> Beyond a Boundary to him.

5|$|According to Njáls saga, Gilli and Sitriuc spent Yule with Sigurðr in Orkney, where Sitriuc {{convinced}} Sigurðr to ally {{himself against}} Brian {{on the condition}} that Sigurðr would gain Gormlaith in marriage. In April 1014, the opposing forces met and clashed at the remarkably bloody Battle of Clontarf. Although Brian's forces ultimately won the day, and Sigurðr himself was amongst the slain, Brian lost his life as well. As for Gilli, he appears in <b>a</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>of</b> Njáls saga that presents a series of supernatural events connected with the conflict. In one instance, a Caithnessman is said to have witnessed valkyrie-like apparitions singing songs for the slain, whilst a similar event is said to have occurred in the Faroe Islands. Priests in Iceland are stated to have encountered paranormal phenomena, whilst an Orcadian is said to have encountered the spectre of Sigurðr before disappearing {{off the face of the}} earth. As for Gilli, the saga asserts that he dreamt of a song that foretold the outcome of the battle and the fall of Brian and Sigurðr. There is reason to suspect that the aforesaid supernatural manifestationsarguably somewhat detached from the saga's general narrativeare actually interpolations of separate material. Elsewhere in the narrative, however, there are examples of paranormal phenomena intervening into human affairs. For example, the episode concerning Gilli's dream seems to directly parallel an earlier episode in which another man, the Icelander Flosi Þórðarson, is depicted dreaming of the burning of the saga's eponym, Njáll Þorgeirsson.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{inheritable}} {{nature of}} coats of arms the College {{have also been}} involved in genealogy since the 15th century. The College regularly conduct genealogical research for individuals with families in the British Isles of all social classes.

The College's extensive records within this realm of study dates back over five centuries. An individual could, if he so wishes, have his family's pedigree placed inside the College's records. This would require the services of {{an officer of the}} College who would then draft a pedigree. The officer would ensure that the pedigree was in the correct format and also advise the client on the documentary evidences necessary to supports such a draft. After this is done, the officer would submit the pedigree to <b>a</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>of</b> two other officers, who would then examine the pedigree for any mistakes or in some cases demand more research. After this examination is completed the pedigree would then be scrivened and placed into the pedigree register of the College.|$|E
