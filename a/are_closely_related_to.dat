5|$|The crag martins {{are four}} species of small {{passerine}} {{birds in the}} genus Ptyonoprogne of the swallow family. They are the Eurasian crag martin (P.rupestris), the pale crag martin (P.obsoleta), the rock martin (P.fuligula) and the dusky crag martin (P.concolor). They <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> each other, and have formerly sometimes been considered to be one species. They <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the Hirundo barn swallows and are placed in that genus by some authorities. These are small swallows with brown upperparts, paler underparts without a breast band, and a square tail with white patches. They can be distinguished from each other on size, the colour shade of the upperparts and underparts, and minor plumage details like throat colour. They resemble the sand martin, but are darker below, and lack a breast band.|$|E
5|$|A vector {{processor}} is a CPU or computer {{system that can}} execute the same instruction on large sets of data. Vector processors have high-level operations that work on linear arrays of numbers or vectors. An example vector operation is A = B × C, where A, B, and C are each 64-element vectors of 64-bit floating-point numbers. They <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Flynn's SIMD classification.|$|E

Poqomam is spoken by around 49,000 people in several small pockets in Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|According to Hesler and Smith's 1979 {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Lactarius, L.torminosus belongs to subgenus Piperites, section Piperites (in which it is the type species), subsection Piperites. Species in this subsection are characterized by having latex that does not turn yellow after exposure to air, and/or that does not stain the cut surface of the mushroom surface yellow. A 2004 phylogenetic analysis of European Lactarius species concluded that L.torminosus falls into a group that includes L.torminosulus, and that these two species <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> a group that includes L.tesquorum, L.scoticus, and L.pubescens.|$|E

5|$|At birth, infants {{are unable}} to wait for their wants {{and needs to be}} met and exhibit a {{defining}} lack of impulse control. With age, developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able to prolong gratification. Developmental psychologists study the progression of impulse control and delay of gratification over the lifespan, including deficiencies in development that <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> attention deficits and behavior problems.|$|E
5|$|Melanins are {{a family}} of dark-pigmented {{substances}} found {{in a wide range}} of organisms. Chemically they <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> dopamine, and there is a type of melanin, known as dopamine-melanin, that can be synthesized by oxidation of dopamine via the enzyme tyrosinase. The melanin that darkens human skin is not of this type: it is synthesized by a pathway that uses L-DOPA as a precursor but not dopamine. However, there is substantial evidence that the neuromelanin that gives a dark color to the brain's substantia nigra is at least in part dopamine-melanin.|$|E
5|$|The Hydrophiinae, {{commonly}} known as sea snakes or coral reef snakes, are a subfamily of venomous elapid snakes that inhabit marine environments for {{most or all of}} their lives. Most are extensively adapted to a fully aquatic life and are unable to move on land, except for the genus Laticauda, which has limited land movement. They are found in warm coastal waters from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific and <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> venomous terrestrial snakes in Australia.|$|E
50|$|Bromsgroveia <b>was</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Ctenosauriscus, and {{together}} with a few other genera they make up Ctenosauriscidae. The ctenosauriscids <b>were</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the poposaurids, as shown by a few shared derived characteristics. The pelvic girdle in Bromsgroveia unites this taxon with Ctenosauriscus, Lotosaurus, Arizonasaurus, and Hypselorhachus.|$|R

5|$|The Mecoptera <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the Siphonaptera (fleas), and {{a little}} more distantly to the Diptera (true flies). They are {{somewhat}} fly-like in appearance, being small to medium-sized insects with long slender bodies and narrow membranous wings. Most breed in moist environments such as leaf litter or moss, and the eggs may not hatch until the wet season arrives. The larvae are caterpillar-like and mostly feed on vegetable matter, and the non-feeding pupae may pass through a diapause until favourable weather conditions occur.|$|E
5|$|The oxides and {{hydroxides}} of neptunium <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> its ions. In general, Np hydroxides {{at various}} oxidation levels are less stable than the actinides before {{it on the}} periodic table such as thorium and uranium and more stable than those after it such as plutonium and americium. This phenomenon is because the stability of an ion increases as the ratio of atomic number to the radius of the ion increases. Thus actinides higher on the periodic table will more readily undergo hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|Unlike true fungi, {{the cell}} walls of oomycetes contain {{cellulose}} and lack chitin. Hyphochytrids have both chitin and cellulose. Slime molds lack a cell wall during the assimilative phase (except labyrinthulids, {{which have a}} wall of scales), and ingest nutrients by ingestion (phagocytosis, except labyrinthulids) rather than absorption (osmotrophy, as fungi, labyrinthulids, oomycetes and hyphochytrids). Neither water molds nor slime molds <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the true fungi, and, therefore, taxonomists no longer group them in the kingdom Fungi. Nonetheless, studies of the oomycetes and myxomycetes are still often included in mycology textbooks and primary research literature.|$|E

5|$|Although Sri Lankan Tamils are {{culturally}} and linguistically distinct, genetic {{studies indicate that}} they <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Sinhalese ethnic group in the island. The Sri Lankan Tamils are mostly Hindus with a significant Christian population. Sri Lankan Tamil literature on topics including religion and the sciences flourished during the medieval period {{in the court of}} the Jaffna Kingdom. Since the beginning of the Sri Lankan Civil War in the 1980s, it is distinguished by an emphasis on themes relating to the conflict. Sri Lankan Tamil dialects are noted for their archaism and retention of words not in everyday use in the Tamil Nadu state in India.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape and}} {{appearance}} of each coral colony depends {{not only on}} the species, but also on its location, depth, the amount of water movement and other factors. Many shallow-water corals contain symbiont unicellular organisms known as zooxanthellae within their tissues. These give their colour to the coral which thus may vary in hue depending on what species of symbiont it contains. Stony corals <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> sea anemones, and like them are armed with stinging cells known as cnidocytes. Corals reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most species release gametes into the sea where fertilisation takes place, and the planula larvae drift as part of the plankton, but a few species brood their eggs. Asexual reproduction is mostly by fragmentation, when part of a colony becomes detached and reattaches elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|This large kiwi {{is one of}} five {{species of}} kiwis {{residing}} in New Zealand. The other four are the tokoeka (Apteryx australis), Okarito brown kiwi (Apteryx rowi), little spotted kiwi (Apteryx owenii), and North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli). Great spotted kiwis are related most closely to the little spotted kiwi. The kiwi genus, Apteryx, is endemic to New Zealand, 44% of the bird species native to New Zealand are endemic. Kiwis are placed in the ratite family, which also includes the emu, ostrich, rhea, and cassowary. All ratites are flightless. Kiwi <b>are</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the extinct moa bird that once inhabited New Zealand.|$|E
