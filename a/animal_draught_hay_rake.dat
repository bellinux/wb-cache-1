50|$|A <b>hay</b> <b>rake</b> is an {{agricultural}} rake {{used to collect}} cut hay or straw into windrows for later collection (e.g. by a baler or a loader wagon). It is also designed to fluff up the hay and turn it over so that it may dry. It is also used in the evening to protect the hay from morning dew.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{system of}} reciprocal exchange labour facilitates the continuous existence of labour intensive technology pertaining to paddy farming by providing unpaid labour together with unpaid <b>draught</b> <b>animals</b> and implements {{in the traditional}} agrarian society in Sri Lanka. This traditional system is, at present, subject to rapid disintegration due to the various socio-economic changes {{brought about by the}} development of the market economy. While the system of exchange labour is disintegrating, hired labour is emerging. Though hired labour provides the necessary man power, it seems to have failed to fill the vacuum because, in contrast to the exchange labour, hired labour involves cash payments. Consequently labour-labour system has become a labour-money system. In addition, hired labour does not provide free of charge <b>draught</b> <b>animals</b> and implements. All these result in incrersed cash cost. Therefore, when the tradition of exchange labour tends to disintegrate, the <b>animal</b> <b>draught</b> power based-labour intensive technology which has been used for paddy land preparation over centuries, has become weak in its ability to compete with its counterpart: mechanical power based-Iabour saving technology. As a result, mechanical power is gaining popularity.

40|$|M. Tech. AgricultureShortly after World War two (WWII), the South African {{government}} {{responded to}} the mounting food production crisis in the homelands by introducing public tractor services. Establishment of irrigation schemes and provision of public tractor services for use by smallholders were two important government-initiated modernisation projects in the homelands. It was {{in line with the}} idea of modernisation that smallholder irrigation schemes were the prime target for public tractor services, and this lead to the rapid abandonment of the use of <b>animal</b> <b>draught</b> for cultivation on these schemes. By the time public tractor services were completely dismantled, cultivation on smallholder irrigation schemes had become almost entirely dependent on tractor draught. Thereafter, hiring the services of privately owned tractor enterprises became the principal way in which farmers on smallholder irrigation schemes in Limpopo Province cultivated their plots. The rising cost of hiring private tractors placed financial stress on the cropping enterprises of smallholder irrigators, generating interest in alternatives that were more affordable. <b>Animal</b> <b>draught</b> represents an attractive alternative to tractor draught. Whereas prevailing economic circumstances on smallholder irrigation schemes favour the adoption of cultivation systems that are cheaper than those offered by private tractor enterprises, it is not known whether <b>animal</b> <b>draught</b> land preparation enterprises are an appropriate alternative to the existing tractor enterprises from an economic and social perspective. In order to resolve this knowledge problem, the current study was done with the following two main objectives: to determine the profitability of the different types of land preparation enterprises operating on smallholder canal irrigation schemes in Vhembe District Municipality; and to determine the social acceptability of these different types of land preparation enterprises by measuring the perceptions {{of the quality of the}} cultivation services provided by these enterprises among plot holders on these schemes...|$|R

50|$|<b>Hay</b> can be <b>raked</b> into rows {{as it is}} cut, {{then turned}} {{periodically}} to dry, particularly if a modern swather is used. Or, especially with older equipment or methods, the hay is cut and allowed to lie spread {{out in the field}} until it is dry, then raked into rows for processing into bales afterwards. During the drying period, which can take several days, the process is usually sped up by turning the cut hay over with a <b>hay</b> <b>rake</b> or spreading it out with a tedder. If it rains while the hay is drying, turning the windrow can also allow it to dry faster. However, turning the hay too often or too roughly can also cause drying leaf matter to fall off, reducing the nutrients available to animals. Drying can also be sped up by mechanized processes, such as use of a hay conditioner, or by use of chemicals sprayed onto the hay to speed evaporation of moisture, though these are more expensive techniques, not in general use except in areas where there is a combination of modern technology, high prices for hay, and too much rain for hay to dry properly.|$|R
5000|$|A {{great number}} of {{haymaking}} songs have been recorded in Lithuania. They are also subcategorized into <b>hay</b> mowing and <b>raking</b> songs. Many songs combine both topics. <b>Hay</b> <b>raking</b> songs are more melancholy than the mowing songs, and they often contain imagery about an orphan girl. Other songs describe all of the tasks associated with haymaking, beginning with the mowing and ending with the feeding of the hay to the animals. Haymaking songs often personify a clover or other beautifully blossoming flower, and often contain references to love. Young peoples' feelings are expressed through {{the images of the}} haymaking process. For example, the song [...] "Ein bernelis per lankelę" [...] (There goes a lad through the field) tells of a brother working in the field with a steel scythe. He plans to mow the clover and adorn his hat with it before enticing the young maiden. In contrast to these love songs are songs focusing on the topic of war. They ruefully sing of the brother who must go off to the great war. Many songs tell off the rounding up of recruits, which shows that these songs are from {{the first half of the}} 19th century.|$|R
