5|$|In the 12th century, French trouvère (troubadour) Chrétien de Troyes, adapted many of {{the myths}} recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses into Old French. However, de Troyes {{was not alone in}} making use of Ovid's material. Geoffrey Chaucer recounted the story in his {{unfinished}} work The Legend of Good Women and briefly <b>alluded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> myth in his Troilus and Criseyde. John Gower included the tale in his Confessio Amantis. References to Philomela are common in the motets of the ars nova, ars subtilior, and ars mutandi musical eras of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.|$|E

Alongside protagonists Tintin and Snowy, Hergé also included the detectives Thomson and Thompson in the story, who had been introduced in the previous story.

5|$|Despite the {{violence}} of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued to be worried about fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts. Low-level unrest continued for several more years. In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants <b>alluded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> memory of the revolt and the threat of violence.|$|E

In January 2016, it was rumoured that a Super Smash Bros. game was being developed by Bandai Namco and that the game was planned as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch. However, the rumour was debunked upon the release of the Switch.|$|E
5|$|Van Zandt, {{though he}} {{personally}} favored annexation by the United States, was {{not authorized to}} entertain any overtures from the US government on the subject. Texas officials were at the moment deeply engaged in exploring settlements with Mexican diplomats, facilitated by Great Britain. Texas's predominant concern was not British interference with the institution of slavery – English diplomats had not <b>alluded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> issue – but the avoidance of any resumption of hostilities with Mexico. Still, US Secretary of State Upshur vigorously courted Texas diplomats to begin annexation talks, finally dispatching an appeal to President Sam Houston in January 1844. In it, he assured Houston that, in contrast to previous attempts, the political climate in the United States, including sections of the North, was amenable to Texas statehood, and that a two-thirds majority in Senate could be obtained to ratify a Texas treaty.|$|E

25|$|The republican {{agitation}} is {{no longer}} emphasized in Caragiale's later works, as republicanism slowly faded {{out of the mainstream}} liberal discourse. Noting this, several critics believe that, in his O scrisoare pierdută, which depicts the battle between two unnamed political camps, the dramatist <b>alluded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conflict between Brătianu's moderates and Rosetti's extremists (as indicated by the fact that all the main characters attend the same rallies). This view was disputed by Zarifopol, who argued that the more pragmatic grouping stands for the Conservatives, and the demagogic one for the National Liberals as a whole.|$|E

25|$|In special relativity, the {{transfer}} of signals at superluminal speeds is impossible, since this would violate the Poincaré-Einstein synchronization, and the causality principle. Following an old argument by Pierre-Simon Laplace, Poincaré (1904) <b>alluded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that Newton's law of universal gravitation is founded on an infinitely great speed of gravity. So the clock-synchronization by light signals could in principle {{be replaced by a}} clock-synchronization by instantaneous gravitational signals. In 1905, Poincaré himself solved this problem by showing that in a relativistic theory of gravity the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light. Although much more complicated, this is also the case in Einstein's theory of general relativity.|$|E
