5|$|Hand's {{three years}} at Harvard Law School were intellectually and {{socially}} stimulating. In his second year, he moved into a boarding house {{with a group of}} fellow law students who were to become close friends. They studied hard and enjoyed discussing philosophy and literature and telling bawdy tales. Hand's intellectual reputation proved less of a hindrance at law school than it had as an undergraduate. He was elected to the Pow-Wow Club, in which law students practiced their skills in moot courts. He was also chosen as <b>an</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Harvard Law Review, although he resigned in 1894 because it took too much time from his studies.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1920s, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) {{reached its}} peak {{membership}} in the South and Midwest after a revival beginning around 1915. Its growth was {{due in part to}} tensions from rapid industrialization and social change in many growing cities; in the Midwest and West, its growth was related to the competition of waves of new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. The KKK was strong in the Florida cities of Jacksonville and Tampa; Miami's chapter was influential enough to hold initiations at the Miami Country Club. The Klan also flourished in smaller towns of the South where racial violence had a long tradition dating back to the Reconstruction era. <b>An</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Gainesville Daily Sun admitted that {{he was a member of}} the Klan in 1922, and praised the organization in print.|$|E
5|$|Manhattan {{shares a}} final kiss with Jupiter before departing {{permanently}} to another galaxy, while an enraged Dreiberg attacks Veidt, who makes {{no effort to}} defend himself. Nevertheless, he defends his actions, claiming that for world peace to be possible, {{there had to be}} sacrifice. Dreiberg rejects his logic declaring that Veidt has deformed and mutilated humanity. Dreiberg and Jupiter return to New York with plans to continue fighting crime. Later, <b>an</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Frontiersman tells a young employee that, as the world is at peace, there is nothing to report on.

Though Kioe Lie disapproves of Kioe Gie's sweetheart, a poor orphan girl named Oeij Ijan Nio, he agrees.|$|E
5|$|During the Provisional Government of Hawaii and the Republic of Hawaii that {{followed}} it, he remained {{loyal to the}} monarchy. Returning to Lahaina, he helped organize native resistance on Maui and was arrested for running out a pro-annexationist pastor at Waineʻe Church. He was elected in 1896 as honorary president of the Hui Aloha ʻĀina (Hawaiian Patriotic League), a patriotic organization established after the overthrow to oppose annexation. In 1897 he became <b>an</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> short-lived anti-annexationist newspaper Ke Ahailono oHawaii (translated as The Hawaiian Herald) run {{by members of the}} Hui Kālaiʻāina (Hawaiian Political Association). Following the annexation of Hawaii to the United States, he was elected as a senator of the first Hawaiian Territorial legislature of 1901 for the Home Rule Party. Afterward, his political fortune declined with the party and his many attempts to win re-elections from 1902 to 1914 ended in defeats, although he was successfully elected the first Sheriff of Maui County for a brief period before his election was declared void due to inconsistencies in the 1903 County Act.|$|E
5|$|In Surakarta Amir {{joined the}} {{nationalist}} movement. He {{would meet with}} fellow Sumatrans and discuss the social plight of the Malay archipelago's populace under Dutch colonial rule.

At school he also met Ilik Sundari, a Javanese woman nearly his age with whom he fell in love. Sundari, the daughter of Raden Mas Kusumodihardjo, {{was one of the few}} female students at the school, and her home was near one of those in which Amir boarded. According to Dini, the two grew closer, Amir teaching Sundari Arabic and Sundari teaching him Javanese. They were soon meeting every day, conversing on a variety of topics.|$|E

After graduating with a JD degree magna cum laude from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.

The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.|$|E
5|$|Rotblat {{returned}} to Britain to become senior lecturer and {{acting director of}} research in nuclear physics at the University of Liverpool. Most of his family had survived the war. With {{the help of a}} Polish man, his brother-in-law Mieczysław (Mietek) Pokorny had created false Polish Catholic identities for Rotblat's sister Ewa and niece Halina. Ewa, taking advantage {{of the fact that she}} was an ash blonde who, like Rotblat, spoke fluent Polish as well as Yiddish, smuggled the rest of the family out of the Warsaw Ghetto. Mietek, Rotblat's brother Mordecai (Michael) and Michael's wife Manya, Rotblat's mother Scheindel, and two Russian soldiers lived in a concealed bunker underneath a house near Otwock, in which Ewa and Halina lived with a Polish family. Displays of Polish anti-Semitism that she witnessed during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising embittered Ewa towards Poland, and she petitioned Rotblat to help the family emigrate to England. He therefore now accepted Chadwick's offer of British citizenship so he could help them escape from Poland. They lived with him in London for some time before becoming established. Halina would go on to graduate from Somerville College, Oxford and University College London, and become <b>an</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dictionary of National Biography.|$|E

5|$|Maritime losses as {{a result}} of the {{hurricane}} were considerable. On the evening of 31August, the 140-ton British vessel Spring, which originated from Liverpool, was beached near Cape Romain within the vicinity of the Raccoon Keys. Massive waves caused the boat to disintegrate, and the crew fled on a longboat toward Charleston, South Carolina, surviving but losing the ship's cargo. The craft Brutus, meanwhile, overturned while en route toward Charleston from New York City, suffering the loss of its rigging and main boom. Despite experiencing damage to its cargo of cheese and potatoes, the ship arrived in Charleston safely. Meanwhile, off of Savannah, Georgia, the storm dismasted the clipper Richmond Packet which was delivering Spanish wine. Along the coast of Charleston, high waves prevented ships from docking at port, and boats did not remain with their moorings, with one breaking free and washing aground at James Island. Moving up the coast, the storm leveled fields of cotton, pushed salt water upstream, and destroyed dams protecting rice fields on the Cooper River, destroying the year's harvest. <b>An</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newspaper Savannah Republican composed a poem reflecting upon and lamenting the plight of seamen who died in the storm. At Sullivan's Island near Charleston, the hurricane beached several vessels, and from Charleston to Georgetown, intense gusts and copious rainfall ruined cotton and rice fields in low-lying regions.|$|E
