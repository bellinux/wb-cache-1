5|$|<b>Actinium</b> trichloride is {{obtained}} by reacting <b>actinium</b> hydroxide or oxalate with carbon tetrachloride vapors at temperatures above 960°C. Similar to oxyfluoride, <b>actinium</b> oxychloride {{can be prepared}} by hydrolyzing <b>actinium</b> trichloride with ammonium hydroxide at 1000°C. However, {{in contrast to the}} oxyfluoride, the oxychloride could well be synthesized by igniting a solution of <b>actinium</b> trichloride in hydrochloric acid with ammonia.|$|E
5|$|Mixing monosodium {{phosphate}} (NaH2PO4) {{with a solution}} of <b>actinium</b> in hydrochloric acid yields white-colored <b>actinium</b> phosphate hemihydrate (AcPO4·0.5H2O), and heating <b>actinium</b> oxalate with hydrogen sulfide vapors at 1400°C {{for a few minutes}} results in a black <b>actinium</b> sulfide Ac2S3. It may possibly be produced by acting with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide on <b>actinium</b> oxide at 1000°C.|$|E
5|$|A soft, silvery-white {{radioactive}} metal, <b>actinium</b> reacts rapidly {{with oxygen}} and moisture in air forming a white coating of <b>actinium</b> oxide that prevents further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and many actinides, <b>actinium</b> assumes oxidation state +3 {{in nearly all}} its chemical compounds. <b>Actinium</b> is found only in traces in uranium and thorium ores as the isotope 227Ac, which decays with a half-life of 21.772 years, predominantly emitting beta and sometimes alpha particles, and 228Ac, which is beta active with a half-life of 6.15 hours. One tonne of natural uranium in ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium-227, and one tonne of natural thorium contains about 5 nanograms of actinium-228. The close similarity of {{physical and chemical properties}} of <b>actinium</b> and lanthanum makes separation of <b>actinium</b> from the ore impractical. Instead, the element is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of 226 in a nuclear reactor. Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, <b>actinium</b> has no significant industrial use. Its current applications include a neutron source and an agent for radiation therapy targeting cancer cells in the body.|$|E
5|$|<b>Actinium</b> reacts rapidly {{with oxygen}} and {{moisture}} in air forming a white coating of <b>actinium</b> oxide that impedes further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and actinides, <b>actinium</b> {{exists in the}} oxidation state +3, and the Ac3+ ions are colorless in solutions. The oxidation state +3 originates from the 6d17s2 electronic configuration of <b>actinium,</b> with three valence electrons that are easily donated to give the stable closed-shell structure of the noble gas radon. The rare oxidation state +2 is only known for <b>actinium</b> dihydride (AcH2); even this may in reality be an electride compound like its lighter congener LaH2.|$|E
5|$|<b>Actinium</b> trifluoride can be {{produced}} either in solution or in solid reaction. The former reaction is carried out at room temperature, by adding hydrofluoric acid to a solution containing <b>actinium</b> ions. In the latter method, <b>actinium</b> metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride vapors at 700°C in an all-platinum setup. Treating <b>actinium</b> trifluoride with ammonium hydroxide at 900–1000°C yields oxyfluoride AcOF. Whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in air at 800°C for an hour, similar treatment of <b>actinium</b> trifluoride yields no AcOF and only results in melting of the initial product.|$|E
5|$|Only {{a limited}} number of <b>actinium</b> {{compounds}} are known including AcF3, AcCl3, AcBr3, AcOF, AcOCl, AcOBr, Ac2S3, Ac2O3 and AcPO4. Except for AcPO4, they are all similar to the corresponding lanthanum compounds. They all contain <b>actinium</b> in the oxidation state +3. In particular, the lattice constants of the analogous lanthanum and <b>actinium</b> compounds differ by only a few percent.|$|E
5|$|Radioactive {{substances}} can harm {{human health}} via (i) local skin contamination, (ii) internal exposure due to ingestion of radioactive isotopes, and (iii) external overexposure by β-activity and γ-radiation. Together with radium and transuranium elements, <b>actinium</b> {{is one of}} the most dangerous radioactive poisons with high specific α-activity. The most important feature of <b>actinium</b> is its ability to accumulate and remain in the surface layer of skeletons. At the initial stage of poisoning, <b>actinium</b> accumulates in the liver. Another danger of <b>actinium</b> is that it undergoes radioactive decay faster than being excreted. Adsorption from the digestive tract is much smaller (~0.05%) for <b>actinium</b> than radium.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of <b>actinium</b> in the Earth's crust {{is only about}} 5%. <b>Actinium</b> is mostly present in uranium-containing, but also in other minerals, though in much smaller quantities. The content of <b>actinium</b> in most natural objects corresponds to the isotopic equilibrium of parent isotope 235U, {{and it is not}} affected by the weak Ac migration. Protactinium is more abundant (10−12%) in the Earth's crust than <b>actinium.</b> It was discovered in the uranium ore in 1913 by Fajans and Göhring. As <b>actinium,</b> the distribution of protactinium follows that of 235U.|$|E
5|$|These bases {{are poorly}} {{soluble in water}} and by their {{activity}} {{are close to the}} hydroxides of rare-earth metals. The strongest base is of <b>actinium.</b> All compounds of <b>actinium</b> are colorless, except for black <b>actinium</b> sulfide (Ac2S3). Dioxides of tetravalent actinides crystallize in the cubic system, same as in calcium fluoride.|$|E
5|$|<b>Actinium</b> hydride was {{obtained}} by reduction of <b>actinium</b> trichloride with potassium at 300°C, and its structure was deduced by analogy with the corresponding LaH2 hydride. The source of hydrogen in the reaction was uncertain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Actinium</b> is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, <b>actinium</b> glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. <b>Actinium</b> has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Actinium</b> metal {{has been}} {{prepared}} by the reduction of <b>actinium</b> fluoride with lithium vapor in vacuum at a temperature between 1100 and 1300°C. Higher temperatures resulted in evaporation of the product and lower ones lead to an incomplete transformation. Lithium was chosen among other alkali metals because its fluoride is most volatile.|$|E
5|$|<b>Actinium</b> was {{discovered}} in 1899 by André-Louis Debierne, an assistant of Marie Curie, in the pitchblende waste left after removal of radium and polonium. He described the substance (in 1899) as similar to titanium and (in 1900) as similar to thorium. The discovery of <b>actinium</b> by Debierne was however questioned in 1971 and 2000, arguing that Debierne's publications in 1904 contradicted his earlier work of 1899–1900. This view instead credits the 1902 work of Friedrich Oskar Giesel, who discovered a radioactive element named emanium that behaved similarly to lanthanum. The name <b>actinium</b> comes from the Greek aktis, aktinos (ακτίς, ακτίνος), meaning beam or ray. This metal {{was discovered}} not by its own radiation but by the radiation of the daughter products. Owing to the close similarity of <b>actinium</b> and lanthanum and low abundance, pure <b>actinium</b> could only be produced in 1950. The term actinide was probably introduced by Victor Goldschmidt in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Chemically, <b>actinium</b> {{is similar}} to lanthanum, which is {{explained}} by their similar ionic radii and electronic structure. Like lanthanum, <b>actinium</b> has oxidation of +3, but it is less reactive and has more pronounced basic properties. Among other trivalent actinides Ac3+ is least acidic, i.e. has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions.|$|E
5|$|The major {{difficulty}} in separation of <b>actinium</b> is {{the similarity of}} its properties with those of lanthanum. Thus <b>actinium</b> is either synthesized in nuclear reactions from isotopes of radium or separated using ion-exchange procedures.|$|E
5|$|The name <b>actinium</b> {{originates}} {{from the}} Ancient Greek aktis, aktinos (ακτίς, ακτίνος), meaning beam or ray. Its symbol Ac {{is also used}} in abbreviations of other compounds {{that have nothing to}} do with <b>actinium,</b> such as acetyl, acetate and sometimes acetaldehyde.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} yield {{is about}} 2% of the radium weight. 227Ac can further capture neutrons resulting {{in small amounts}} of 228Ac. After the synthesis, <b>actinium</b> is separated from radium and from the products of decay and nuclear fusion, such as thorium, polonium, lead and bismuth. The extraction can be performed with thenoyltrifluoroacetone-benzene solution from an aqueous solution of the radiation products, and the selectivity to a certain element is achieved by adjusting the pH (to about 6.0 for <b>actinium).</b> An alternative procedure is anion exchange with an appropriate resin in nitric acid, which {{can result in a}} separation factor of 1,000,000 for radium and <b>actinium</b> vs. thorium in a two-stage process. <b>Actinium</b> can then be separated from radium, with a ratio of about 100, using a low cross-linking cation exchange resin and nitric acid as eluant.|$|E
5|$|Owing to its scarcity, {{high price}} and radioactivity, <b>actinium</b> {{currently}} has no significant industrial use.|$|E
5|$|The {{actinide}} series derives {{its name from}} the first element in the series, <b>actinium.</b> The informal chemical symbol An is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide. All but one of the actinides are f-block elements, with the exception being either <b>actinium</b> or lawrencium. The series mostly corresponds to the filling of the 5f electron shell, although <b>actinium</b> and thorium lack any f-electrons, and curium and lawrencium have the same number as the preceding element. In comparison with the lanthanides, also mostly f-block elements, the actinides show much more variable valence. They all have very large atomic and ionic radii and exhibit an unusually large range of physical properties. While <b>actinium</b> and the late actinides (from americium onwards) behave similarly to the lanthanides, the elements thorium, protactinium, and uranium are much more similar to transition metals in their chemistry, with neptunium and plutonium occupying an intermediate position.|$|E
5|$|The high {{radioactivity}} of lawrencium {{would make}} it highly toxic to living cells, causing radiation poisoning. The {{same is true for}} <b>actinium.</b>|$|E
5|$|The low natural concentration, and {{the close}} {{similarity}} {{of physical and}} chemical properties to those of lanthanum and other lanthanides, which are always abundant in actinium-bearing ores, render separation of <b>actinium</b> from the ore impractical, and complete separation was never achieved. Instead, <b>actinium</b> is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of 226 in a nuclear reactor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Actinium</b> {{is found}} only in traces in uranium ores – one tonne of uranium in ore {{contains}} about 0.2 milligrams of 227Ac – and in thorium ores, which contain about 5 nanograms of 228Ac per one tonne of thorium. The <b>actinium</b> isotope 227Ac is a transient member of the uranium-actinium series decay chain, which begins with the parent isotope 235U (or 239Pu) and ends with the stable lead isotope 207Pb. The isotope 228Ac is a transient member of the thorium series decay chain, which begins with the parent isotope 232Th and ends with the stable lead isotope 208Pb. Another <b>actinium</b> isotope (225Ac) was transiently present in the neptunium series decay chain, beginning with 237Np (or 233U) and ending with thallium (205Tl) and near-stable bismuth (209Bi), but this chain existed only in the early Solar System, due to the short half-life of neptunium-237.|$|E
5|$|<b>Actinium</b> oxide (Ac2O3) can be {{obtained}} by heating the hydroxide at 500°C or the oxalate at 1100°C, in vacuum. Its crystal lattice is isotypic with the oxides of most trivalent rare-earth metals.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the change}} in {{electron}} configuration, unbiunium {{is not expected to}} behave chemically very differently from its lighter congeners. A 2016 calculation on unbiunium monofluoride (UbuF) showed similarities between the valence orbitals of unbiunium in this molecule and those of <b>actinium</b> in <b>actinium</b> monofluoride (AcF); in both molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbital is expected to be nonbonding, unlike in the superficially more similar nihonium monofluoride (NhF) where it is bonding. Nihonium has the electron configuration 5f146d107s27p1, with an s2p valence configuration. Unbiunium may hence be somewhat like lawrencium in having an anomalous s2p configuration from relativistic effects that does not affect its chemistry: the bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, and polarisabilities of the UbuF molecule are expected to continue the trend down group 3. Hence lawrencium and unbiunium are expected to be similar to lutetium and <b>actinium</b> respectively, and not thallium and nihonium as would be expected from looking at their electron configurations. The Ubu–F bond is expected to be strong and polarised, just like for the lighter group 3 monofluorides.|$|E
5|$|Several {{isotopes}} of bismuth {{with short}} half-lives occur within the radioactive disintegration chains of <b>actinium,</b> radium, and thorium, and more have been synthesized experimentally. Bismuth-213 {{is also found}} on the decay chain of uranium-233.|$|E
5|$|Articles {{published}} in the 1970s and later suggest that Debierne's results {{published in}} 1904 conflict with those reported in 1899 and 1900. Furthermore, the now-known chemistry of <b>actinium</b> precludes its presence {{as anything other than}} a minor constituent of Debierne's 1899 and 1900 results; in fact, the chemical properties he reported make it likely that he had, instead, accidentally identified protactinium, which would not be discovered for another fourteen years, only to have it disappear due to its hydrolysis and adsorption onto his laboratory equipment. This has led some authors to advocate that Giesel alone should be credited with the discovery. A less confrontational vision of scientific discovery is proposed by Adloff. He suggests that hindsight criticism of the early publications should be mitigated by the then nascent state of radiochemistry: highlighting the prudence of Debierne's claims in the original papers, he notes that nobody can contend that Debierne's substance did not contain <b>actinium.</b> Debierne, who is now considered by the vast majority of historians as the discoverer, lost interest in the element and left the topic. Giesel, on the other hand, can rightfully be credited with the first preparation of radiochemically pure <b>actinium</b> and with the identification of its atomic number 89.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum is {{the first}} element and {{prototype}} of the lanthanide series. In the periodic table, it appears {{to the right of}} the alkaline earth metal barium and to the left of the lanthanide cerium. Lanthanum is often considered to be a group 3 element, along with its lighter congeners scandium and yttrium and its heavier congener, the radioactive <b>actinium,</b> although this classification is sometimes disputed. Similarly to scandium, yttrium, and <b>actinium,</b> the 57 electrons of a lanthanum atom are arranged in the configuration 5d16s2, with three valence electrons outside the noble gas core. In chemical reactions, lanthanum almost always gives up these three valence electrons from the 5d and 6s subshells to form the +3 oxidation state, achieving the stable configuration of the preceding noble gas xenon. Some lanthanum(II) compounds are also known, but they are much less stable.|$|E
5|$|The {{decay series}} of 235U, {{which is called}} the <b>actinium</b> series, has 15 members and {{eventually}} decays into lead-207. The constant rates of decay in these decay series makes the comparison of the ratios of parent to daughter elements useful in radiometric dating.|$|E
5|$|The {{melting point}} of {{zirconium}} is 1855°C (3371°F), and {{the boiling point}} is 4371°C (7900°F). Zirconium has an electronegativity of 1.33 on the Pauling scale. Of the elements within the d-block with known electronegativities, zirconium has the fifth lowest electronegativity after hafnium, yttrium, lanthanum, and <b>actinium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Three group 3 {{elements}} occur naturally, scandium, yttrium, {{and either}} lanthanum or lutetium. Lanthanum continues the trend started by two lighter members in general chemical behavior, while lutetium behaves more similarly to yttrium. While {{the choice of}} lutetium would be {{in accordance with the}} trend for period 6 transition metals to behave more similarly to their upper periodic table neighbors, the choice of lanthanum is in accordance with the trends in the s-block, which the group 3 elements are chemically more similar to. They all are silvery-white metals under standard conditions. The fourth element, either <b>actinium</b> or lawrencium, has only radioactive isotopes. <b>Actinium,</b> which occurs only in trace amounts, continues the trend in chemical behavior for metals that form tripositive ions with a noble gas configuration; synthetic lawrencium is calculated and partially shown to be more similar to lutetium and yttrium. So far, no experiments have been conducted to synthesize any element that could be the next group 3 element. Unbiunium (Ubu), which could be considered a group 3 element if preceded by lanthanum and <b>actinium,</b> might be synthesized in the near future, it being only three spaces away from the current heaviest element known, oganesson.|$|E
5|$|Francium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolFr and atomic number87. It {{used to be}} known as eka-caesium and <b>actinium</b> K. It is the second-least electronegative element, behind only caesium, and is the second rarest naturally occurring element (after astatine). Francium is a highly radioactive metal that decays into astatine, radium, and radon. As an alkali metal, it has one valence electron.|$|E
5|$|Francium-223 is {{the most}} stable isotope, with a {{half-life}} of 21.8minutes, and {{it is highly unlikely}} that an isotope of francium with a longer half-life will ever be discovered or synthesized. Francium-223 is the fifth product of the <b>actinium</b> decay series as the daughter isotope of actinium-227. Francium-223 then decays into radium-223 by beta decay (1149keV decay energy), with a minor (0.006%) alpha decay path to astatine-219 (5.4MeV decay energy).|$|E
5|$|The first {{element of}} the actinides, <b>actinium</b> gave the group its name, much as {{lanthanum}} had done for the lanthanides. The group of elements is more diverse than the lanthanides and therefore {{it was not until}} 1928 that Charles Janet proposed the most significant change to Dmitri Mendeleev's periodic table since the recognition of the lanthanides, by introducing the actinides, a move suggested again in 1945 by Glenn T. Seaborg.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{decay mode}} for {{isotopes}} of protactinium lighter than (and including) {{the most stable}} isotope 231Pa (i.e., 212Pa to 231Pa) is alpha decay and the primary mode for the heavier isotopes (i.e., 232Pa to 240Pa) is beta decay. The primary decay products of isotopes of protactinium lighter than (and including) 231Pa are <b>actinium</b> isotopes and the primary decay products for the heavier isotopes of protactinium are uranium isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Actinides {{have similar}} {{properties}} to lanthanides. The 6d and 7s electronic shells are filled in <b>actinium</b> and thorium, and the 5f shell is being filled with further increase in atomic number; the 4f shell is {{filled in the}} lanthanides. The first experimental evidence for the filling of the 5f shell in actinides was obtained by McMillan and Abelson in 1940. As in lanthanides (see lanthanide contraction), the ionic radius of actinides monotonically decreases with atomic number (see also Aufbau principle).|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{chemical}} behaviour, and trends going down group 3 for properties such as melting point, electronegativity and ionic radius, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and <b>actinium</b> {{are similar to}} their group 1–2 counterparts. In this variant, the number of f electrons in the most common (trivalent) ions of the f-block elements consistently matches {{their position in the}} f-block. For example, the f-electron counts for the trivalent ions of the first three f-block elements are Ce 1, Pr 2 and Nd 3.|$|E
