5|$|Beauregard {{continued}} {{commanding the}} defenses of Petersburg {{in the early}} days of the siege, but with the loss of the Weldon Railroad in the Battle of Globe Tavern (August 18–21), he was criticized for not attacking more forcefully and he became dissatisfied with the command arrangements under Lee. He hoped for an independent command, but his desires were thwarted in two instances: Lee chose Lt. Gen. Jubal Early to lead an expedition north through the Shenandoah Valley <b>and</b> <b>threaten</b> Washington, and Davis chose Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood to replace the faltering Joseph E. Johnston in the Atlanta Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Khalid {{detached}} one regiment under Dharar ibn al-Azwar {{and ordered}} him to attack {{the front of the}} army of Dairjan (left center) {{in order to create a}} diversion <b>and</b> <b>threaten</b> the withdrawal of the Byzantine right wing from its advanced position. With the rest of the cavalry reserve he attacked Gregory's flank. Here again, under simultaneous attacks from the front and flanks, the Byzantines fell back, but more slowly because they had to maintain their formation.|$|E
5|$|Streamside camps offered wood, water, {{and some}} {{protection}} from the hazards of open land. The prairie could be dangerous in time of native unrest, and trade ceased entirely for a time during the Dakota War of 1862. Prairie fires, driven by winds, were a risk in dry spells. Wet weather turned rivers into torrents, approaches to streams into bogs, and worn paths into morasses. Blizzards could strand traders <b>and</b> <b>threaten</b> them with starvation. Insects harassed both the traders and their draft animals, depriving them of sleep and weakening them.|$|E

The definition and classification of endangered <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> species is the heart of any successful effort in conservation and protection. Ev- eryone interested in endangered <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> species has probably been frustrated by plans, programs, definitions and lists which often complicate the situation rather than improve it.

5|$|The {{middle finger}} gesture {{was used in}} Ancient times {{as a symbol of}} sexual intercourse, in a manner meant to degrade, intimidate <b>and</b> <b>threaten</b> the {{individual}} receiving the gesture. It also represented the phallus, with the fingers next to the middle finger representing testicles; from its close association, the gesture may have assumed apotropaic potency. In the 1st-century Mediterranean world, extending the finger was one of many methods used to divert the ever-present threat of the evil eye.|$|E
5|$|Abby {{is in love}} again, {{but then}} finds out that Charles is the front {{for a group of}} thugs wanting to build a marina at Lotus Point for drug trafficking. Abby pretends {{to go along with the}} {{marriage}} and accepts a two million dollar wedding gift from Charles. After the ceremony she has the marriage annulled, but keeps the money. After this, Abby marries Greg Sumner. It isn't love, but rather a political marriage. Abby forms another company, Morikame, in order to buy Lotus Point. When her former partners find out <b>and</b> <b>threaten</b> to have her arrested for fraud, she donates Lotus Point to the government as a wildlife preserve. Abby goes after a political appointment that Greg wants, and leaves Knots Landing to be a trade representative in Japan. Abby later forms another illegal company with Nigel Treadwell, and tries to take over the Sumner Group, but her plan fails. She moves back into her old house on the cul-de-sac.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{ordered the}} {{refurbishing}} {{of the state}} penitentiary, which had been damaged by a fire, and called for an extensive state geological survey. He also advised {{the creation of a}} sinking fund to retire the state's debt. The state adopted a new constitution during Crittenden's term, though Crittenden was not a delegate to the constitutional convention and apparently had little influence on the drafting of the document. Most Whigs opposed the calling of a constitutional convention because it would necessarily involve reapportionment of the state's legislative districts <b>and</b> <b>threaten</b> Whig dominance in the General Assembly; nevertheless, Crittenden belatedly supported the call for a convention during his 1848 gubernatorial campaign.|$|E
40|$|The native {{vegetation}} remnants in {{the agricultural}} country of subhumid Tasmania are important strongholds for regionally and globally rare <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> species.

Rare <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> species were found in remnants of widely varying integrity, as indicated by native and exotic species richness and cover. Some species were only found in remnants that were of poor integrity. Efforts to preserve vegetation remnants need to be directed towards both those that are representative and of high integrity, and those that contain rare <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> species.

5|$|Ferdinand was {{a complex}} plan, {{involving}} misinformation and extensive physical deception. The underlying plot was the Allied forces had been {{surprised to find}} the Germans had not moved forces from the Mediterranean to re-inforce Normandy. Therefore, plans to invade southern France and the Balkans were looking less appealing. Instead the Allied commanders had decided to focus all of their resources on the Italian campaign. The real force assigned to Dragoon, the US VI Corps, would land in Genoa. Meanwhile, notional formations, such as the Seventh Army and the British 5th Airborne Division would support pushes along the Italian front <b>and</b> <b>threaten</b> targets in the Balkans. Ferdinand also recycled some of Zeppelin's threats against Turkey with the fictional British Ninth and Twelfth Armies.|$|E
5|$|Mehmed {{had decided}} to {{construct}} a fortress {{in what is now}} Elbasan which would provide a perennial base for future Ottoman assaults on Skanderbeg's domains. The fortress especially worried Venice since Elbasan was constructed {{on the banks of the}} Shkumbin River which would allow the Ottomans to send ships into the Adriatic <b>and</b> <b>threaten</b> Venetian colonies. Seeing that his situation had become unfavorable, Skanderbeg made a trip to Italy where he would try to convince Pope Paul II and Ferdinand I of Naples to give him aid for his war. Despite many promises from the pope, Skanderbeg received little due to the fear of a Neapolitan war with Rome and infighting in the Roman Curia. Ferdinand and the Republic of Venice likewise deferred Skanderbeg's requests to the pope. By the time he left Italy, the League of Lezhë had been weakened and needed his intervention.|$|E

5|$|San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana {{completed}} 32 of 46 {{passes for}} 356 yards {{before leaving the}} game with an injury in the fourth quarter. The injury, {{similar to the one}} that ended Lee Roy Selmon's career, would require season-ending surgery <b>and</b> <b>threaten</b> Montana's football future. Steve DeBerg's 31-yard touchdown pass to Gerald Carter in the third quarter brought the Buccaneers to within a touchdown, but they would not score again. The 49ers' seven interceptions of DeBerg were a team record, and one short of the NFL record. DeBerg placed blame for the loss on himself, but teammates defended him, pointing out that he was under constant pressure from the 49ers' pass rush. Opposing safety Ronnie Lott said that DeBerg was predictable as to where he would throw the ball when pressured. James Wilder rushed for 81 yards and caught five passes. Selmon's number 63 was retired in a halftime ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The Latchkey is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The premise of the plot focuses on two businessmen who are friends Will (or Bill in some publications) and John. Will gives John {{the key to his}} apartment so he had stay there while Will goes on vacation. The landlady of the house leases the apartment to two ladies. John decides to go to Will's apartment and lets himself in with the key and finds the two girls asleep.

5|$|The {{operation}} was planned {{in a matter}} of hours following a meeting between Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke, during which Holbrooke urged Tuđman to seize Prijedor <b>and</b> <b>threaten</b> to capture Banja Luka from the VRS, short of actually seizing the city, as he believed such a development would force Bosnian Serb leaders to the negotiating table. Inadequate planning and preparation, combined with flawed military intelligence on the defending force and disregard for the high water level of the Una and Sava rivers, led to a high number of casualties and little success. The offensive was called off one day after it was launched and the bridgeheads were evacuated. The HV ultimately blamed Major General Vinko Vrbanac for its failure. Vrbanac had authorized the offensive instead of deferring to the Chief of the General Staff General Zvonimir Červenko.|$|E
5|$|The threat Tirpitz had an {{important}} influence on British naval strategy during the Second World War. She was commissioned in February 1941 and completed her crew training late that year. At {{about the same time}} the German high command decided to station the battleship in Norway; this deployment was intended to deter a feared Allied invasion of Norway <b>and</b> <b>threaten</b> the convoys which regularly sailed through the Arctic Sea to the Soviet Union. These convoys carried large quantities of war material from ports in the UK and Iceland, and were frequently attacked by the German air and naval units stationed in Norway. Tirpitz arrived in Norway in January 1942 and operated from anchorages located in fjords. While she was operational the Allies had to keep a powerful force of warships with the British Home Fleet to guard against the possibility of a sortie against the Arctic convoys, and capital ships accompanied most convoys part of the way to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|With {{the decline}} of the Byzantine fleet in the latter 12th century, the Empire {{increasingly}} relied on the fleets of Venice and Genoa. Following the sack of 1204 however, sources suggest the presence of a relatively strong fleet already under the first Nicaean emperor, Theodore I Laskaris, although specific details are lacking. Under John III and Theodore II (1254–1258), the navy had two main strategic areas of operations: the Aegean, entailing operations against the Greek islands (chiefly Rhodes) as well as the transport and supply of armies fighting in the Balkans, and the Sea of Marmara, where the Nicaeans aimed to interdict Latin shipping <b>and</b> <b>threaten</b> Constantinople. Smyrna provided the main shipyard and base for the Aegean, with a secondary one at Stadeia, while the main base for operations in the Marmara Sea was Holkos, near Lampsakos across the Gallipoli peninsula.|$|E

5|$|Alarmed by {{the actions}} of the Temeraires crew, Campbell met with Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell the {{following}} day and informed him of the mutineers' demands. Mitchell reported the news to the Admiralty while Campbell returned to Temeraire and summoned the crew on deck once more. He urged them to return to duty, and then dismissed them. Meanwhile, discipline had begun to break down among the mutineers. Several of the crew became drunk, and some of the officers were struck by rowdy seamen. When one of the marines who supported the mutiny was placed in irons for drunken behaviour and insolence, a crowd formed on deck and tried to free him. The officers resisted these attempts and as sailors began to push <b>and</b> <b>threaten</b> them, Campbell gave the order for the marines to arrest those he identified as the ringleaders. The marines hesitated, but then obeyed the order, driving the unruly seamen back and arresting a number of them, who were immediately placed in irons. Campbell ordered the remaining crew to abandon any mutinous actions, and deprived of its leaders, the mutiny collapsed, though the officers were on their guard for several days afterwards and the marines were ordered to carry out continuous patrols.|$|E
5|$|In {{efficiency}} wage models, {{workers are}} paid at levels that maximize productivity instead of clearing the market. For example, in developing countries, firms might {{pay more than}} a market rate to ensure their workers can afford enough nutrition to be productive. Firms might also pay higher wages to increase loyalty and morale, possibly leading to better productivity. Firms can also pay higher than market wages to forestall shirking. Shirking models were particularly influential. Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz (1984) created a model where employees tend to avoid work unless firms can monitor worker effort <b>and</b> <b>threaten</b> slacking employees with unemployment. If the economy is at full employment, a fired shirker simply moves to a new job. Individual firms pay their workers a premium over the market rate to ensure their workers would rather work and keep their current job instead of shirking and risk having {{to move to a}} new job. Since each firm pays more than market clearing wages, the aggregated labor market fails to clear. This creates a pool of unemployed laborers and adds to the expense of getting fired. Workers not only risk a lower wage, they risk being stuck in the pool of unemployed. Keeping wages above market clearing levels creates a serious disincentive to shirk that makes workers more efficient even though it leaves some willing workers unemployed.|$|E
5|$|Initially, forecasters {{anticipated}} Babe {{to maintain}} its westward course as it strengthened <b>and</b> <b>threaten</b> the Philippines; however, its forward motion gradually slowed as it neared the region. On September 5, an upper-level trough formed over northeastern Asia and created a weakness in the subtropical ridge, allowing Babe to turn north-northwestward. Over the following two days, the storm quickly strengthened as divergence increased ahead of the storm, with Babe attaining typhoon status early on September 6 Between 0832 UTC on September 5 and 2204 UTC on September 7, the storm's barometric pressure dropped from 988 mbar (hPa; 29.18 inHg) to 907 mbar (hPa; 26.79 inHg), approximately 1.3 mbar (hPa; 0.04 inHg) per hour. Early on September 8, Babe attained its peak intensity with winds of 240 km/h (150 mph) while situated approximately 465 km (290 mi) southeast of Ishigaki Island. This ranked it as {{the first and only}} super typhoon of the 1977 season. At this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency estimated the storm to have had peak ten-minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph) and a minimum pressure of 905 mbar (hPa; 26.72 inHg).|$|E
