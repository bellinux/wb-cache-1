500|$|Laptop Magazines Michael Prospero {{praised the}} 2010 15-inch model's display, calling it [...] "bright and crisp". He further commented, [...] "While {{reflections}} from the glossy display weren't overwhelming, it's <b>also</b> <b>nice</b> to know there's an antiglare option—though {{only for the}} higher resolution display. Still, colors were bright, blacks were deep and dark, and viewing angles were excellent both vertically and horizontally." [...] He also lauded {{the quality of the}} iSight webcam, the responsiveness of the touchpad, the microphone and speakers, as well as the performance of the new CPUs for the 15" [...] model and the long battery life. Complaints included the price of the laptop, the low number of USB ports, and the lack of HDMI.|$|E
500|$|Monica Herrera of Billboard said Usher's [...] "star {{power is}} clearly rubbing {{off on the}} 16-year-old", commenting that Bieber [...] "shows off his smoothest moves yet [...] " [...] and [...] "tackles his toughest choreography." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV News commented, [...] "While Bieber had {{previously}} teased his dancing skills in the [...] "Baby" [...] video, he really channeled Usher's smooth moves in this newest clip." [...] Tamar Antai also of MTV said, [...] "Usher {{does most of the}} heavy lifting where dancing is concerned, and Justin Bieber, who's more of a singer than a dancer, is in no danger of upstaging Usher on the dance floor." [...] Antai compared Bieber's moves to Usher in his [...] "Caught Up" [...] video, commenting [...] "it's nice to see Justin expanding the scope of talents to include pelvic thrusts, Matrix-style slo-mo leans" [...] and, [...] "it's <b>also</b> <b>nice</b> to see Justin looking a little more mature and sophisticated in a hoodie and leather jacket....and his videos are growing up with him, as this is his flashiest, most grandiose video yet. Antai also commented on the appeal of the video, commending Meyers, [...] "who put that classic early '00s-style big-money polish on the piece – for employing fire, shirtless dudes, white ninjas..." ...|$|E

[...] The fourth episode Time Squad review by Stanley Reynolds of The Times stated, [...] "...nice to hear the youngsters holding their breath in anticipation of a little terror." [...] Reynolds elaborated, [...] "Television science fiction has got too self-consciously jokey lately. [...] It is <b>also</b> <b>nice</b> to have each episode complete within itself, while still carrying on the saga of Blake's struggle against the 1984-ish Federation. But is that dark-haired telepathic alien girl, the latest addition to Blake's outer-space merry men, going to spell love trouble for blonde Jenna?

Never you mind the American man: you leave him to worry out his own salvation. You are not the girl to put him right, even where he is wrong. And it is not civilisation. Civilisation has a deal to answer for, I admit: don't you load it up with this {{additional}} trouble. The thing that is wrong in this case of yours--if you will forgive my saying so--is you. You make a fool of yourself; you marry a man who is a mere animal because he appeals to your animal instincts. Then, like the lady who cried out 'Alack, I've married a black,' you appeal to heaven against the injustice of being mated with a clown. You are not a nice girl, either in your ideas or in your behaviour. I don't blame you for it; you did not make yourself. But when you set to work to attract all that is lowest in man, why be so astonished at your own success? There are plenty of shocking American men, I agree. One meets the class even outside America. But nice American girls will tell you that there are <b>also</b> <b>nice</b> American men. There is an old proverb about birds of a feather. Next time you find yourself {{in the company of a}} shocking American man, you just ask yourself how he got there, and how it is he seems to be feeling at home. You learn self-control. Get it out of your head that you are the centre of the universe, and grasp the idea that a petticoat is not a halo, and you will find civilisation not half as wrong as you thought it." ...|$|E
