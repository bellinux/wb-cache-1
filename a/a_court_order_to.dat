25|$|For instance, {{investigators}} with Denver District Attorney's Office successfully {{identified a}} suspect in a property theft case using a familial DNA search. In this example, the suspect's blood left {{at the scene of}} the crime strongly resembled that of a current Colorado Department of Corrections prisoner. Using publicly available records, the investigators created a family tree. They then eliminated all the family members who were incarcerated at the time of the offense, as well as all of the females (the crime scene DNA profile was that of a male). Investigators obtained <b>a</b> <b>court</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> collect the suspect's DNA, but the suspect actually volunteered to come to a police station and give a DNA sample. After providing the sample, the suspect walked free without further interrogation or detainment. Later confronted with an exact match to the forensic profile, the suspect pleaded guilty to criminal trespass at the first court date and was sentenced to two years probation.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginnings}} of the Maple Leafs NHL franchise arose out of a long-running dispute between Eddie Livingstone, owner of the National Hockey Association's Toronto Blueshirts, and his fellow NHA owners, particularly Sam Lichtenhein of the Montreal Wanderers. Tempers boiled over when the NHA added a second Toronto team in 1916–17, representing the 228th Battalion of the Canadian army. The 228th was forced to withdraw its team in mid-season when the unit was called overseas. That left the NHA with an odd number of teams, and the team owners—at a meeting that did not include Livingstone—decided to even-up the number of teams by suspending operations of the Torontos {{for the rest of}} the season. All players were given to other NHA teams {{for the rest of the}} season. At the time, the plan was to return the players to the Toronto franchise, but the rest of the league wanted Livingstone out. At the end of the season Toronto was reinstated, with the condition that the club was to be sold within 60 days. However, Livingstone turned down several offers and obtained <b>a</b> <b>court</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> prevent the sale.|$|E
