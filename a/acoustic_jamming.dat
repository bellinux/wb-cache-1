50|$|Humans may jam echolocating animals {{deliberately}} or accidentally. Recent {{efforts have}} been made to develop <b>acoustic</b> <b>jamming</b> deterrents to exclude bats from buildings or bridges, or to keep bats away from wind turbines where large numbers of mortalities occur. These deterrents have been shown to reduce bat activity over a small area. However, scaling up acoustic deterrents to large volumes for applications such as keeping bats away from wind turbines is difficult because of the high atmospheric attenuation of ultrasound.|$|E

5000|$|The {{song was}} {{composed}} and demoed by lead singer Joe Elliott in 1989 during the writing and recording sessions for the band's fifth album Adrenalize. The track was shelved {{for three years}} until it resurfaced following a late-night <b>acoustic</b> <b>jamming</b> session with the Hothouse Flowers in March 1992, which yielded three B-side tracks. When Elliott suggested recording [...] "Two Steps Behind", Collen suggested that it be recorded as an acoustic version. The track was recorded {{in a few hours}} in April 1992 and was released as the B-side to [...] "Make Love Like a Man" [...] in the UK. Later in 1993, the producers of the film Last Action Hero contacted the band requesting a new song for the film's soundtrack. As the band were on tour at the time, they were unable to record brand new material for the soundtrack. Instead, they sent the producers the multitracks to the acoustic version of [...] "Two Steps Behind". The track was remixed and conductor Michael Kamen added an orchestral string treatment to the song. The inclusion of the song on the film's soundtrack inspired the band to create the compilation album Retro Active from B-sides and unreleased material, and record new parts to the electric version of the song on 7-11 June.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the {{presence}} of multiple flying conspecifics, echolocating bats avoid jamming by adjusting the spectral and/or temporal features of their vocalizations. However, {{little is known about}} how bats alter their pulse acoustic characteristics to adapt to an acoustically jamming situation during flight. We investigated echolocation behavior in a bat (Miniopterus fuliginosus) during free flight under <b>acoustic</b> <b>jamming</b> conditions created by downward FM jamming sounds mimicking bat echolocation sounds. In an experimental chamber, the flying bat was exposed to FM jamming sounds with different terminal frequencies (TFs) from loudspeakers. Echolocation pulses emitted by the flying bat were recorded using a telemetry microphone (Telemike) mounted {{on the back of the}} bat. The bats immediately (within 150 ms) shifted the TFs of emitted pulses upward when FM jamming sounds were presented. Moreover, the amount of upward TF shift differed depending on the TF ranges of the jamming sounds presented. When the TF range was lower than or overlapped the bat’s mean TF, the bat TF shifted significantly upward (by 1 – 2 kHz, Student’s t-test, P< 0. 05), corresponding to 3 – 5 % of the total bandwidth of their emitted pulses. These findings indicate that bats actively avoid overlap of the narrow frequency band around the TF...|$|E

Later in the year the song took on its own identity, with an initial demo recorded under the title [...] "Sweet Angel" [...] in November 1967 at the London studio. The song's lyrics were written in early 1968, as evidenced by handwritten lyrics marking the song as complete by January 14 that year, which also gave the song a full title of [...] "My Angel Catherina (Return of Little Wing)" [...] giving more weight to its comparison with the Axis: Bold as Love track. A solo demo was also recorded in March 1968, and released as part of unofficial bootleg <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Jams</b> and on the companion disc to 1995 book Voodoo Child: The Illustrated Legend of Jimi Hendrix.|$|R

[...] Nisid Hajari of Entertainment Weekly called the album a [...] "respectable testament" [...] to Nowell's memory, ultimately noting that the record [...] "coheres more on an intellectual rather than emotional level, its sound too diffuse to be dramatic." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the record an A-, commenting, [...] "Junkies who retain enough soul to create music at all are generally driven to put their brilliance and stupidity in your face.
