5|$|The highest notes {{can have}} a shrill, {{piercing}} quality and {{can be difficult to}} tune accurately. Different instruments often play differently in this respect due to the sensitivity of the bore and reed measurements. Using alternate fingerings <b>and</b> <b>adjusting</b> the embouchure help correct the pitch of these notes.|$|E
5|$|Moving towards {{sustainability}} is also {{a social}} challenge that entails international and national law, urban planning and transport, local and individual lifestyles and ethical consumerism. Ways of living more sustainably can take many forms from reorganizing living conditions (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities and sustainable cities), reappraising economic sectors (permaculture, green building, sustainable agriculture), or work practices (sustainable architecture), using science to develop new technologies (green technologies, renewable energy and sustainable fission and fusion power), or designing systems in a flexible and reversible manner, <b>and</b> <b>adjusting</b> individual lifestyles that conserve natural resources.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Flower {{was created by}} Vincent Diamante, a video game music {{composer}} and professor at the University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division. He had previously scored the music for Cloud, Chen's first game, and Dyadin {{when they were both}} at the University of Southern California. He worked directly with the development team to integrate the music into the game by adjusting the placements of flowers and the tones that each type played when they were reached. He did this by harmonizing the gameplay with the music, <b>and</b> <b>adjusting</b> the music dynamically to correspond to changes in the game world. Diamante used his music to influence the development team in adapting ideas he had for the game.|$|E

5|$|Amy {{is also a}} major {{character}} in the 2003–2006 anime series Sonic X. Attacking one of Eggman's machines, Sonic triggers Chaos Control and sends him, Amy, Tails and other characters from their world to Earth. On Earth, they befriend a human boy, Chris Thorndyke and his family and friends; Amy particularly likes his maid, Ella, who teaches her to cook. She frequently tries to woo Sonic and his discomfort angers her. In one episode Amy makes a seashell bracelet, which Sonic graciously accepts; shortly afterward he saves her from drowning, and she returns the favor when one of Eggman's robots holds him underwater. Sonic also rescues Amy from Eggman's creations on other occasions. She sometimes flares up at Sonic, attacking him when she realizes that he has tricked her into acting insane. The second season opens with arcs based on Adventure and Adventure 2, where Amy reprises {{her role in the}} games. During the first and second seasons Amy and her friends—often without Sonic—are frequently together, capturing (and recapturing) Chaos Emeralds from Doctor Eggman <b>and</b> <b>adjusting</b> to their celebrity status on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Before Crisis was {{the first}} {{original}} video game developed by Square Enix exclusively for mobile phones, originally released on NTT DoCoMo's FOMA mobile devices, and the first action role-playing game exclusive to the platform. The company's first major mobile title, also in collaboration with NTT DoCoMo, was a remake of the original Final Fantasy. Using {{lessons learned from the}} development of the Final Fantasy port, the team worked hard to make Before Crisis a uniquely mobile experience, with gameplay features built to exploit mobile functions such as the camera and network capacity. The camera function used to generate Materia was based on a simple image recognition that specifies the Materia generated based on the picture's general color. One of the challenges during development was to keep the framerate smooth during moments of high action, especially as no two mobiles would have identical components. In addition to these problems were issues with integrating the multiplayer functions, balancing the gameplay for different playstyles, creating a comfortable button layout, <b>and</b> <b>adjusting</b> the amount of content they could include for mobiles while maintaining the desired product quality.|$|E
5|$|Deriving {{from the}} {{concepts}} of tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons, nearly all roguelikes give the player control of a character, which they may customize by selecting a class, race, and gender, <b>and</b> <b>adjusting</b> attributes points and skills. At {{the start of the}} game, the character is placed at the top-most level of a dungeon, with basic equipment such as a simple weapon, armor, torches, and food. Following along the role-playing concept of a dungeon crawl, the player moves the character through the dungeon, collecting treasure which can include new weapons, armors, magical devices, potions, scrolls, food, and in-game money, while having to fight monsters that roam the dungeon. Most combat is performed simply by attempting to move the character into the same space as the monster, which the game then calculates the damage that the character and monster deal. Other types of attacks, such as firing an arrow or performing an offensive magic spell, can often be performed as well.|$|E

5|$|Destiny 2 {{was later}} ported to the PSP. Development began in 2005, after the {{commercial}} success of Eternias PSP port. The port {{was developed by}} Alfa System, a frequent collaborator with the Tales team on spin-off titles. The project was directed by Yoshito Higuchi, who had worked on Destiny 2 and became {{the director of the}} GameCube port of Tales of Symphonia. While the earlier port of Destiny made significant changes, the Destiny 2 port was meant to preserve and add onto the content of the original. Some of the adjustments included minor tweaks to gameplay, adjustments to fit the PSP's control layout, <b>and</b> <b>adjusting</b> the graphics from 4:3 to 16:9 screen ratio. A new dungeon featuring added story elements was also created. It was released on February 15, 2007.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} approach, the radii of the given circles are {{modified}} appropriately by an amount Δr so {{that two of}} them are tangential (touching). Their point of tangency is chosen as the center of inversion in a circle that intersects each of the two touching circles in two places. Upon inversion, the touching circles become two parallel lines: Their only point of intersection is sent to infinity under inversion, so they cannot meet. The same inversion transforms the third circle into another circle. The solution of the inverted problem must either be (1) a straight line parallel to the two given parallel lines and tangent to the transformed third given circle; or (2) a circle of constant radius that is tangent to the two given parallel lines and the transformed given circle. Re-inversion <b>and</b> <b>adjusting</b> the radii of all circles by Δr produces a solution circle tangent to the original three circles.|$|E
5|$|The Last of Us Remastered changes {{little from}} the basic {{gameplay}} {{of the original}} version. As such, it is an action-adventure survival horror game that uses a third-person perspective. The game involves gunfights, melee combat and a cover system. For most of the game, players control Joel; Ellie and other companions are controlled by the artificial intelligence. Remastered uses the DualShock 4's touchpad to navigate inventory items, and the light bar signals health, scaling from blue to orange and red when taking damage. In addition, audio recordings found in the game world can be heard through the controller's speaker; the original version forced players to remain in a menu while the recordings were played. The game's Photo Mode allows players to capture images of the game by pausing gameplay <b>and</b> <b>adjusting</b> the camera freely. In the menu, players {{have the ability to}} watch all cutscenes with audio commentary featuring creative director Neil Druckmann, Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portrayed Joel and Ellie, respectively.|$|E
