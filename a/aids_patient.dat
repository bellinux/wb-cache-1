Oral swabs from 130 <b>Aids</b> <b>patients</b> were plated onto CHROMagar Candida medium and 142 isolates were recovered. Yeast isolates were identified by classical methods and serotyped using the Candida Check system-Iatron. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to the NCCLS microbroth assay. C. albicans was the most frequently isolated species (91 %), and 70 % of the isolates belonged to serotype A. We detected 12 episodes of co-infection (9 %), including co-infection with both serotypes of C. albicans. Non-albicans species were isolated from 12 epi-sodes, 50 % of them exhibited DDS or resistance to azoles. Otherwise, only 8 out 130 isolates of C. albicans exhibited DDS or resistance to azoles. Brazilian <b>Aids</b> <b>patients</b> are infected mainly by C. albicans serotype A, most of them susceptible to all antifungal drugs.

She later made her acting debut in the 1993 thriller Baazigar that earned her nominations for the Filmfare Awards for Best Supporting Actress and Lux New Face of the Year.

The 2000 box office hit Dhadkan marked a turning point in her career, earning her praise and Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies.

500|$|Dallas Buyers Club is a 2013 American biographical neo-Western drama film, co-written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, and {{directed}} by Jean-Marc Vallée. The film {{tells the story of}} Ron Woodroof, an <b>AIDS</b> <b>patient</b> diagnosed in the mid 1980s when HIV/AIDS treatments were under-researched, while the disease was not understood and highly stigmatized. As part of the experimental AIDS treatment movement, he smuggled unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into Texas for treating his symptoms, and distributed them to fellow people with AIDS by establishing the [...] "Dallas Buyers Club" [...] while facing opposition from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Two fictional supporting characters, Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), and Rayon (Jared Leto), were composite roles created from the writer's interviews with transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors.|$|E
500|$|Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana {{took the}} unusual step of basing the {{ethnicity}} and {{gender of the}} characters on the actors they cast, even though the roles were based on real-life detectives. For example, the role of Frank Pembleton, although based on the African-American Detective Harry Edgerton, was not race-specific until Andre Braugher auditioned and was cast. This impressed Braugher, who believed fully developed roles were often written for white characters and black roles were generally two-dimensional and stereotypical. This belief developed in part from Braugher's poor experience playing Detective Winston Blake on the television series Kojak, where he objected to the show's treatment of race. Ned Beatty, the best-known member of cast when the series debuted, was personally approached by Levinson and Fontana to play Stanley Bolander. Although Beatty respected the two men and liked the show, he was reluctant to take the role because he believed NBC would corrupt the series and change it to a typical police show. Beatty claimed his agents and managers [...] "pushed, dragged and hauled" [...] him into meeting with Levinson, but Beatty ultimately accepted the role. Kyle Secor was cast as Tim Bayliss by Fontana, who remembered the actor from his role as gay <b>AIDS</b> <b>patient</b> Bret Johnson in Fontana's previous show, St. Elsewhere.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his book}} The Ends of Human Life Emanuel used the <b>AIDS</b> <b>patient</b> [...] "Andrew" [...] {{as an example}} of moral medical dilemmas. Andrew [...] talked to a local support group and signed a living will asking that life {{sustaining}} procedures be withdrawn if there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The will was not given to anyone but kept in his wallet, and no one was given power of attorney. [...] There were questions about his competence since he had AIDS dementia when he signed the will. Still, Andrew's lover said that he had talked about such situations, and asked that Andrew be allowed to die. Andrew's family strongly disagreed that Andrew wanted to die. Dr. Wolf previously saved Andrew's life, but promised to help him avoid a [...] "miserable death". [...] The ICU wanted guidance from Dr. Wolf as to how aggressively they should try to keep Andrew alive, as his chances of surviving a cardiac arrest were about zero. Two other critical patients were recently refused admission because of a bed shortage. There was a question as to whether Andrew's lover was representing Andrew's wishes or his own. There was also a question as to whether Andrew’s parents knew Andrew better than others, or whether they were motivated by guilt from rejecting Andrew's identification as a gay male. The cost of aggressive treatment was $2,000 per day.|$|E

She was not averse to making {{physical}} contact with AIDS patients, though it was still unknown whether the disease could be spread that way. Diana was the first British royal figure to contact AIDS patients. In 1987, she held hands with an <b>AIDS</b> <b>patient</b> {{in one of her}} early efforts to de-stigmatise the condition. Diana noted: [...] "HIV does not make people dangerous to know. You can shake their hands and give them a hug. Heaven knows they need it.

[...] To Diana's disappointment, the Queen did not support this type of charity work, suggesting she get involved in [...] "something more pleasant". In October 1990, Diana opened Grandma's House, a home for young AIDS victims in Washington, D.C. She was also a patron of the National AIDS Trust. In 1991, she famously hugged one victim during a visit to the AIDS ward of the Middlesex Hospital, which she had opened in 1987 as the first hospital unit dedicated to this cause in the UK.

We aimed to determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasite in AIDS patients in hospital, not only those with diarrhoea, and to compare them with the general community. Clinically diagnosed <b>aids</b> <b>patients</b> in a Zambian teaching hospital were interviewed and examined, and stool specimens were studied for parasite infection. A control group was recruited from adults in a township near Lusaka. Of 90 AIDS patients (58 % male), 50 (56 %) had chronic diarrhoea and 9 (10 %) had diarrhoea of shorter duration.
