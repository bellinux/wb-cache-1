Financial stress scores also explained 30 % of the negative variance in personal <b>and</b> <b>work</b> satisfaction. This study indicates as much as 50 % of overall stress could be reduced by improved financial management, thus contributing significantly to their personal <b>and</b> <b>work</b> satisfaction which counter-balances stress which lowers productivity...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were focussed on exploring the relationship between the individual constructs psychological contract breach (PCB), job satisfaction, organisational support <b>and</b> that of <b>work</b> engagement to add to previous literature. The relationship between PCB <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement has been previously researched and two different views are held. One that believes there is no direct relationship between PCB <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement, <b>and</b> one that believes there is a direct relationship. These different views confirm the complexity of the relationship that exist between PCB <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement. To explore this complex relationship we introduced two moderators to ascertain their moderating effect individually on the relationship between PCB <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement. The benefits to organisations <b>and</b> employees when <b>work</b> engagement levels are high have been researched and confirmed. An online survey specifically addressing the research objectives was sent out to members of a service organisation who are employed at different organisations across various industries within South Africa. A total of 1029 responses were analysed, using simple linear regression models to determine the relationship between psychological contract breach, job satisfaction and organisational support individually <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement <b>and</b> multi variable regression models were used to determine the moderating effect that job satisfaction and organisational support has as moderators on the relationship between psychological contract breach <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement. For the sample population, it was determined that this study support the view that there is a significant direct relationship between PCB breach <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement as well as between job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement <b>and</b> organisational support <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement. It was determined that job satisfaction has a moderating effect on the relationship that exist between psychological contract breach <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement <b>and</b> that organisational support does not have a moderating effect on the relationship.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003. Tracking and {{addressing}} police members' effectiveness {{in areas that}} could impact on the standard of their services is important. Burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement are specific focus areas in this regard. To measure burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement, {{it is important to}} use reliable and valid instruments. However, {{there is a lack of}} empirical research systematically investigating police burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement in South Africa, as well as serious limitations, including poorly designed studies, a lack of sophisticated statistical analyses and poorly controlled studies. Furthermore, South Africa is a multicultural society and therefore, when burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement measures are applied to different cultural groups, issues of equivalence and bias become important. Because a lack of South African norms exists for the Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey (MBI-GS) <b>and</b> Utrecht <b>Work</b> Engagement Scale (UWES), it is difficult to identify burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement. Therefore, it is important to determine norms for the levels of burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement that could serve as reference for police officers in the South African Police Service (SAPS). It also seems relevant to consider differences in burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement between different demographic groups as well as between the different provinces in South Africa. Furthermore, it appears as if job stressors and coping strategies may be related to burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement. However, no studies were found that included these factors in a causal model of burnout or work engagement in police officers in South Africa The objectives of this research were to standardise the MBI-GS and the UWES for the SAPS and to determine equivalence and bias for each instrument, to determine norms and demographic differences between burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement levels <b>and</b> to test a causal model that could explain the role of job stress and coping in burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagementDoctora...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe study {{intends to}} figure out a {{relationship}} between the emotional intelligence, self efficacy and other personality traits on the one hand, <b>and</b> <b>work</b> mentality <b>and</b> <b>work</b> satisfaction on the other hand. The study is going to find out if <b>work</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>work</b> mentality is correlated with personal traits of teachers. The research is done on sample of 188 teachers of different scientific background, ages, and belonging both to rural and urban area. The instruments used were The Work Satisfaction Questionnaire (Constantin, 2004), The work Mentality Questionnaire (Constantin, 2004), The 33 -items questionnaire for measurement of the emotional intelligence (Schutte et all), Self-Efficacy Scale and Five Factor Personality Inventory. The results show an image upon the <b>work</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>work</b> mentality of the teachers in terms of different variables and also the relation between personal traits <b>and</b> <b>work</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>work</b> mentality in teaching career. The results show an image regarding the relationships between teachers’ personal traits <b>and</b> their <b>work</b> mentality <b>and</b> satisfaction; these could be useful in developing personal development programs for teachers in order to enhance their work efficiency...|$|R
