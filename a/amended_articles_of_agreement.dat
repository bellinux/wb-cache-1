40|$|The Asian {{crisis was}} the third {{financial}} crisis of the 1990 s. Even more than its predecessors it {{raised questions about the}} international community’s approach to crisis prevention and crisis management. It led reservations to be voiced, and not only in Asia, about full and unfettered international capital mobility and about the policy priorities of the International Monetary Fund. This paper discusses the policy challenges posed by the Asian crisis. It starts in Section 1 by reconsidering the controversy over capital mobility. Even before the crisis struck, the IMF was on record as favoring the liberalization of capital flows and had proposed <b>amending</b> its <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agreement</b> to make the promotion of capital account liberalization a purpose of the Fund and to give it jurisdiction over restrictions on capital movements. In the wake of a crisis characterized by volatile financial flows and contagious currency crises, capital mobility is increasingly seen as a mixed blessing. There is a feeling, especially in Asia, that <b>amending</b> the <b>Articles</b> giving the Fund jurisdiction over capital account restrictions would be a bridge too far. The first part of the paper therefore seeks to reconcile the fundamental case for international capital mobility with Asia’s less-than-heartening recen...|$|R
40|$|The paper explores {{whether and}} how current lending-of-last-resort {{practices}} can be extended beyond national borders. It argues that what makes lending of last resort effective {{at the national level}} is a blend of resource availability, technical discretion, ex-ante supervision, and powers of enforcement. Accordingly, the importance of the distinction between illiquidity and insolvency and of penalty-rate financing is downplayed. Some peculiarities of the international environment make it difficult to replicate this structure, and this may explain why recent large-scale rescue packages have worked less than satisfactorily. However, private contingent credit facilities and IMF lending into arrears in the context of internationally-sanctioned, temporary moratoria on foreign debt, may offer some scope for effective, though limited in aims and resources, international liquidity support. To this purpose, <b>amending</b> the IMF <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agreement</b> appears indispensable, both to signal, contrary to the Bretton Woods design, the desirability of a high degree of capital mobility, and to facilitate the handling of temporary suspensions of foreign payments when such actions prove unavoidable. financial market, international cooperation, financial aid...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the effects of}} financial crisis in Asia on the progress toward capital account liberalization. It notes that during the IMF Annual Meeting in Hongkong in 1997, a consensus has been reached to <b>amend</b> the IMF <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agreement</b> to include capital account liberalization among the objectives that Fund members should seek. However, since then, the outburst of financial crisis in Asia has cast some doubts about the desirability of capital account liberalization. The paper {{discusses the}} role that large capital flows played in the Asian crisis, and notes some distortions and policy mistakes that have contributed to increased vulnerabilities of the Asian countries to a sudden reversal of capital flows. The next section discusses three different forms of criticism of capital account liberalization: ideological, macroeconomic and microeconomic. Final part of the paper provides some guidance how {{to think about this}} difficult and controversial issue, and it concludes than instead of focusing on limiting the international flows of capital, policy makers should focus on creating the necessary preconditions and pursue such policies that would allow their countries to enjoy the benefits of liberal movement of capital, without undergoing a risk of destabilizing swings in capital flows. ...|$|R
