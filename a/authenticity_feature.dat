This criterion is also recommended for English language teaching settings such as EAP where {{the students are}} to deal with real-world {{and authentic}} language use. The present study aims at evaluating {{the current status of}} the EAP textbooks and the materials included in them in Iran by the administration of the authenticity evaluation checklist. Accordingly, seeking to find data both qualitatively and quantitatively, the study was conducted to seek for the lecturers’ views on the authenticity level of the EAP textbooks. Thus, the results of the interview and the evaluation checklist reveal that although authenticity of context, teacher, student, and text is deemed as essential by this group of teachers, the current textbooks for EAP have limited authenticity and in some aspects authenticity is even absent. The interview results revealed {{that the majority of the}} EAP teachers believed that the current EAP textbooks need to be reengineered and the texts need revision. Thus, the findings can be used by EAP curriculum designers and materials developers in taking into consideration the <b>authenticity</b> <b>feature</b> as an important factor in designing EAP textbooks in future in Iran and in similar language teaching contexts...|$|E

It {{has been used for}} the treatment of flue and common cold, healing of wounds and burns, as anti-microbial agent as well as the source of antioxidants [1, 2]. Consumer preference, and hence the price of the honey, mainly depends on its botanical origin and organoleptic characteristics.

The assessment of honey botanical origin (besides melissopalynological analysis) now days is oriented toward finding marker compounds. Aroma profile is one of the most typical <b>authenticity</b> <b>feature</b> of the honey and therefore volatile component analyses of the samples were performed by means of headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) followed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC, GC-MS). PDMS/DVB fiber coating was used and > 50 compounds were identified. Willow nectar honey contained 3 -methylbutanoic and 3 -metltylpentanoic acids that may be considered as biomarkers as well as relatively high percentage of phenylacetonitrile and β-damascenone. Potential biomarkers of willow honeydew honey were 3 -methylbutanoic and 2 -methylbutanoic acids while found methyl salicylate was specific marker. Ubiquitous honey volatiles were also identified in all the samples such as hotrienol, benzaldehyde, cis- and trans-linalool oxides, lilac aldehydes and others.

40|$|Although many {{perspectives}} {{suggest that}} authenticity {{is important for}} well-being, people do not always have {{direct access to the}} psychological processes that produce their behaviors and, thus, are not able to judge whether they are behaving consistently with their personality, attitudes, values, motives, and goals. Even so, people experience subjective feelings of authenticity and inauthenticity, raising the question of factors that influence people’s judgments of whether they are being authentic. The present studies used descriptive, correlational, experimental, and experience sampling designs to examine possible influences on self-judgments of authenticity, including the congruence between people’s behavior and inner dispositions, the positivity of the behavior, their personal beliefs about <b>authenticity,</b> <b>features</b> of the interaction, and trait authenticity. Studies 1 A and 1 B examined the role of people’s beliefs about authenticity in self-judgments of authenticity.

And, Study 3 used an experience sampling design to study people’s experiences of state authenticity in daily life.

The fundamental {{concept of}} generative learning involves {{the creation and}} refinement of personal mental constructions about the environments (Ritchie and Volkl 2000).

When students are learning online, they are able to link new information to old, acquire meaningful knowledge and use their metacognitive abilities (Bonk and Reynolds 1997).

In fact the overall results showed no significant difference from the previous (‘non ELF’) version of the exam, while the listening part had a higher pass rate than the overall oral test which involved interaction with a native speaker. As far as we know, the co-certification is the first example of an internationally recognized board engaging systematically with ELF features, notably non-native phonology and intonation patterns, in a test of listening.

K. Čiurlionio dailės muziejaus filialui projektas“. Projekto autorė ir pirmoji restauravimo darbų vadovė Čerškutė į vienuolyno fundatoriaus Kristupo Paco sumanymus stengėsi įsigilinti ir jų nepažeisti. Vėliau, per dažnai keičiantis šio komplikuoto objekto restauravimo darbų vadovams ir nesant greta meno istoriko, būta visko: pasiekta ir gerų rezultatų, tačiau neišvengta ir skaudžių klaidų. Pažaislio vienuolyne įvairūs konservavimo, restauravimo ir atkūrimo darbai vykdomi jau trisdešimt penkerius metus, bet iki šiol atliktų darbų kokybė nė karto nebuvo įvertinta paveldosaugos aspektu. Tad iš esmės pirmą kartą, pasirinkus tam tikrus vertinimo kriterijus, bandoma aptarti ir įvertinti šiame komplekse atliktų paveldosaugos darbų kokybę. Pagal paveldo apsaugą reglamentuojančius dokumentus pagrindiniu vertinimo kriterijumi nusistatytas kultūros vertybės autentiškumas (sumanymo, formos, medžiagos, atlikimo būdo, aplinkos ir funkcijos aspektai). “The {{project of}} {{restoration}} and adaptation of Pažaislis ensemble for {{the branch of}} the National M. K. Čiurlionis Art Museum in Kaunas” prepared by architect Stefanija Čerškutė in 1969 has initiated a range of complex restoration work of Pažaislis Camaldoli monastery ensemble. Various services of conservation, restoration and reconstruction have been provided for 35 years; however, no one has evaluated yet {{the quality of the}} results in terms of heritage preservation. Therefore, this is the first case of discussing and assessing the quality of heritage preservation work in terms of some evaluation criteria. According to the documents determining the concept of heritage preservation, the authenticity of a cultural asset {{is one of the main}} criteria with regard to its concept, form, materials, construction methods, aspects of surrounding and functions. The structure of this large object is very complex, and the volume and variety of work is impressing. Therefore, we have decided to choose the interior of St Virgin Mary Visitation Church with reference to some individual interior cases, which served as an example in discussing the most important issues of heritage preservation in the context of the entire Baroque ensemble. It has turned out that we need to address the heritage issues on three main levels of restoration and adaptation: 1) the restoration of murals, 2) the restoration of stucco mouldings, 3) the arrangement of surrounding space. Therefore, the article discusses in great detail the restoration of frescos, in the first place, and then the restoration of stucco mouldings, by highlighting the characteristic shortcomings, main issues and results. Afer evaluating these aspects in terms of the authenticity criterion, it has been admitted that the quality of fresco restoration is high. The same <b>authenticity</b> <b>features</b> have been used to assess the improvement of the church space. However, the authentic equipment was destroyed afer 1832. Therefore, the projects of renovating the individual interiors generated multiple issues. Searching for solutions, it is important to take into account all the conditions of renovation in the context of preserving Pažaislis ensemble as a unique Baroque heritage object. The article analyzes the renovation of the choir, the chancel, the chapels and the sub-dome space (e. g. restoring the wall partition and the structure of the altar side in the chancel, replacing the floor-cover of the sub-dome space, etc). It is worth mentioning that the results of restoring this unique monument have overcome the shortcomings identified...|$|R

The central issue addressed in the book can be formulated as the following question: what are the features of visitors’ attractions and the visitors features that determine visitors’ satisfaction. The paper consists of the theory part and the empirical study. As a result of theoretical investigation, a number of conclusions concerning the nature and concept of visitors’ attractions were formulated. Questionnaire surveys were conducted among visitors of four attractions located in the West Poland (N = 1770) : the Archaeological Festival in Biskupin, the Museum of Agriculture in Szreniawa, the Agricultural Museum in Dziekanowice and the Zoological Garden in Poznań. It was found, that visitors' satisfaction is determined by two main groups of factors: subject-related (visitors’ features) and object-related (attraction features). The subject-related factors determining satisfaction include gender, age, education, size of the place of residence, distance from the place of residence, acquaintance with the attraction {{and the frequency of}} visiting similar attractions, interest in the subject matter related to the attraction, being part of a sightseeing group, motivations – especially related to benefits in terms of education, relaxation and a sense of <b>authenticity.</b> Attraction <b>features</b> that determine visitors’ satisfaction include exhibitions containing vivid interpretations, shows, intriguing show-pieces, dioramas, live animals and animal paddocks resembling real-life conditions, authentic and nostalgia-provoking buildings and interiors.

40|$|Video games contain representations, {{and these}} can have effects on players, for example {{on the ways}} they {{understand}} certain concepts or see certain places. The purpose of this thesis is to delve into how Japan is represented in video games. With that target in mind, the video game Ôkami (Clover Studio, 2008) for Nintendo's Wii console has been analyzed as a case study, and the potential effects of its representations have been reflected on. In order {{to carry out this}} work, the context of the Japanese popular culture industry has been considered, while the particular perspective of a Japanophile has been adopted. The first concept refers to the combination of enterprises responsible of popularizing Japanese culture internationally through products (with manga, anime and video games as leaders) since the last years of the 20 th century. Regarding Japanophiles, they are understood in this thesis as the most avid (non-Japanese) consumers of those products who, carried by a 'Japanophile' euphoria, have formed a social movement and an identity that are bound to Japanese culture. The methods employed have mainly been an extensive literature review and a game analysis. The purpose of the literature review has been to provide theoretical background to the thesis, discussing three main subjects: Japanophilia and the Japanese popular culture industry, representations from a game perspective, and representations from a player perspective. This theoretical background has been built drawing mostly from the field of game studies, but also from the fields of cultural studies and cultural geography, constituting the research as an interdisciplinary one. Furthermore, the literature review has also helped to understand better the method of game analysis. The thesis has produced four main results: firstly, the certainty that Ôkami constitutes a door from Japanese popular culture into Japanese traditional culture, allowing Japanophiles to access aspects of the country that do not usually prevail in the products they consume. This traditional world, however, appears commodified and re-conceptualized, displaying popular elements such as cliches. Secondly, the polysemic character of video games is reaffirmed, as well as {{the fact that they are}} better understood as generative substrates. This conclusion has been reached upon finding that many of Ôkami's representations are very interpretable, and that some can even contradict each other. The main, most feasible representations of this kind portray Japan as a place of sexism, neoliberalism and ethnical supremacism. The third conclusion is that Ôkami contains elements that provide its depiction of the country with geographic <b>authenticity,</b> a <b>feature</b> that is interesting in light of how it can help players to understand better the Japanese reality. According to the fourth and last conclusion, Ôkami's game world is understood as a world of Japanophile affect.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} in two parts. The {{introduction}} {{begins with an}} examination of the myths of Rhesus and Dolon which are independent of Iliad 10. It concludes that the author knew of these and adapted parts of them. The section on <b>authenticity</b> summarises those <b>features</b> of Rh. which have been regarded by scholars as incompatible with Euripidean authorship, as well as some evidence which has previously been ignored. It concludes that a combination of unusual features in Rh. point away from the play being an early work of E. In particular, these are: a limited use of colloquialism; the absence of ÏÎµÏÎ¯ and the scarcity of Î¬ÏÏ; the lameness of many of the repetitions; intertextual allusions to other tragic texts; enjambement between strophe and antistrophe at 350 - 351; the presence of two sets of separated strophes and antistrophes; the delivery of a lyric monody by the deus ex machina; a preference for shorter periods in anapaests than E.; the absence of a dramatic exposition; the unannounced symmetrical entries at 264; physical contact between actor and chorus at 681; the appearance of two dei ex machina; the realistic role of the chorus and the absence of any intellectual or emotional dimension. I believe that Rh. was written after the death of E., but have found no evidence to suggest who wrote it. The introduction concludes with a brief survey of the textual sources. The commentary is based on J. Diggle's text (1994), although some other readings or conjectures have been preferred. New conjectures have been introduced at 4 - 5 and 247.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{understand}} the meaning of the phenomenon autonomy in learning, related to medicine and health-care students’ perceptions of learning and development in clinical education. We know little about how autonomy influences individual thinking, action and awareness of learning in clinical education. Studies in this thesis showed a connection between autonomy and experiences of authenticity. There is also a knowledge gap concerning <b>authenticity</b> as phenomenon <b>featured</b> in a medical education context. An understanding {{of the ways in which}} students’ learning and professional development are facilitated by autonomy and authenticity is considered vital for future development of clinical education. This thesis is ontologically and epistemologically grounded within the social constructivist-interpretative paradigm. The overall aim was achieved through four research questions, represented by the aims in four scientific studies that together constitute the findings in this thesis. The conducted research was positioned within the phenomenological hermeneutic research tradition, describing and understanding phenomena and their meaning revealed through hermeneutics. The studies were undertaken using narrative inquiry. Context for studies I-IV are students’ clinical placements, at hospital wards and clinics in a primary care setting, or in some cases in a home care setting or a laboratory environment. Studies I, II and IV, rest on paradigmatic narrative reasoning, whilst study III apply narrative analysis and the construction of stories, however after a theoretical analysis of the collected data. Analysis of data in this thesis rests heavily on the work by Ricoeur, and the view of interpretation as the “hinge” between language and lived experience. Findings show that autonomy was shaped of and given meaning by Autonomy as a qualitatively different view of a discipline, Autonomy as a social phenomenon, and Autonomy as authentic experience. Autonomy in learning constituted a social phenomenon and something that evolved in relation to others. Findings in this thesis also displayed connections between autonomy in learning and experiences of authenticity in clinical education. Furthermore, findings indicated that transformative learning processes contributed to the development of professional identity, triggered by authentic practical experiences, and the perceived meaning of these experiences. Authentic clinical experience, here interpreted as internal authenticity, was a prerequisite for experiencing membership in a community of practice, thus making internal authenticity a component in the development of professional identity. Students perceived a need for attachment, i. e. attachment to patients, to supervisors, to the workplace, to the situation and to reasoning and knowledge. Authenticity was enhanced when relationships with supervisors, patients and other professional categories were formed. Thus, attachment is here seen as a condition for experiencing authenticity, and authenticity is here a prerequisite for autonomy...|$|R

I was strictly a Marvel Comics head; Avengers, Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Iron Fist, you name it. I loved Marvel because it was the city; it was all New York.

[...] Darryl Makes Comics' first book is DMC, a 90-page anthology graphic novel set in 1985 that features McDaniels as a superhero who confronts both criminals and other superheroes whose recklessness threatens innocent lives. The comic's version of DMC wears McDaniels' signature Adidas sneakers, fedora and rope chain, along with an elongated turtleneck that masks his face. The book is written by McDaniels and Damion Scott, and edited by Darryl Makes Comics' Editor-in-Chief, Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez and Senior Editor Rigo [...] "Riggs" [...] Morales. Each chapter in the anthology is illustrated by a different artist, because, as McDaniels explained, [...] " [...] If DMC was really running around and bumped into four different people, they'd have four different descriptions of what he was like.

[...] But then another dude is like, [...] "No! He had a sword and shield!" [...] We thought, if so many people saw something different in DMC, we'd have to have different artwork to represent their opinions on him or their interpretation on him." [...] In addition, graffiti writers such as MARE 139 were hired to give the shots of 1985 New York City graffiti a sense of <b>authenticity.</b> The book <b>features</b> an introduction by Greg Pak, a cover by Sal Buscema and Bob Wiacek and interior pinups by Carlos Pacheco, Chris Burnham, ChrisCross, Dexter Vines, and Shelby Robertson, some of which are homages to iconic comics covers that influenced the creative staff as children.

40|$|Introduction. Hypogalactia is a {{condition}} of decreased secretory activity of mammary glands in lactational period [1, c. 67; 5, c. 98]. Primary and secondary hypogalactias are distinguished. Primary one is conditioned by anatomical and functional pe¬culiarities of mammary glands {{as well as by}} moth¬er’s severe diseases associated with extragenital pathology (diabetes mellitus, diffuse toxic goiter), occurs rarely, only in 4 - 10 % of women. Later on, women-in- childbirth who took these preparations had no lactation at first hours or days after labor or lactation appeared in later periods and was insuffi¬cient [3, c. 56; 6, c. 87]. Secondary hypogalactia is mostly a temporary condition [2, c. 35; 8, c. 23]. The reason that caused hypogalactia should be found out to this aim [4, c. 45; 7, c. 56]. A special group of women can be distinguished according to the development of primary hypoga-lactia - these are the women who underwent Cesar-ean section. Early hypogalactia is singled out as to the time of its occurrence. It appears during first 10 days after labor. Late hypogalactia occurs 10 days after. The aim of this work was to study special fea-tures of clinical course of postnatal period and in-vestigate the effect of «Shirafza» phytomedication on lactation in women in childbirth with a decreased lactational function. Material and methods of the study. 60 women in childbirth have been examined who were divided into two groups: I main group - 30 women with a decreased lactational function. II - control group - 30 women in childbirth with a preserved lactation¬al function. Life history, somatic and gynecologic diseases in the history, special features of menstrual and reproductive functions, the course of pregnancy, labor and postnatal period have been studied in all women. In newborns there were determined: condi¬tion at birth, evaluation by Apgar’s scale, primary loss of body-weight and the degree of its recovery by the fourth-fifth day of life, peculiarities of the course in early postnatal adaptational period. Lactational function in women was evaluated on the fourth-fifth day of postnatal period on the basis of clinical examinations of the woman in childbirth, day amount of milk that is produced, food supple¬ments of mixtures to the infant’s feeding and in- deces of weight loss and its restoration during first four-five days after birth. Normal lactation was re¬garded {{a condition}} without food supplements, when maximum weight loss was no more than 6 %, resto¬ration of initial weight no less than 95 % during early neonatal period. S. N. Gaidukov’s classification has been used to evaluate the degree of insufficiency of lactational function (1999) : I degree of failure was regarded milk deficiency no more than 25 % from the needed quantity; II degree - 50 %, III degree - up to 75 %, IV degree - over 75 %. Statistical processing of the data was performed on a personal computer IBM by means of statistical programme EXCEL making use of variational statistical methods. <b>Authenticity</b> of special <b>features</b> was established by means of Stu-dent’s t-criteria. Differences of indeces were regard-ed authentic at value of p 0, 05). Average age of women in labor didn’t differ for a fact (25, 8 ± 4, 2 and 25, 1 ± 4, 1 of a year correspondingly), A high frequency of somatic pa-thology has been found out: in the main group - in 22 (73, 3 %), in the control - in 12 (40 %) of women (p< 0, 05). Gynecological diseases in the anamnesis are regarded a factor of risk for disorders in the re-productive system which causes hormonal distur-bances, failure of childbearing function with further complications of postnatal period and also affects formation and duration of lactation. There were gy-necological diseases in the anamnesis in 23 (76, 6 %) women in the main group and 11 (36, 6 %) (p< 0, 05) - in the control. At the same time menstrual function disorders were really more often in the main group - 21 (70 %) womem in comparison with the control group - in 4 (13, 3 %) (p< 0, 05). In the main group in the structure of menstrual function disorders at-tention was drawn to the predominance of such nosologic forms as dysmenorrheal - in 5 (16, 6 %), polymenorrhea - in 2 (6, 6 %), irregular menses - in 12 (40 %) women. Only in the main group in the an-amnesis there were revealed such disorders as late menarche - in 1 (3, 3 %) (p< 0, 05), hypomenstrual syndrome - in 1 (3, 3 %) patient. A normal course of postnatal period in the main group was observed in 4 women (13, 3 %) in the control - in 16 (53, 3 %). Decrease of lactational function - in 22 (73, 3 %) women of the main group and 4 (13, 3 %) in the control one, subinvolution of uterus - in 4 (13, 3 %) women of the main group and 1 (3, 3 %) woman of the control group. As subinvolution of uterus oc-curred more often in women from the main group, the factors which contributed to the appearance of this complication were analysed. In women from the main group cardiovascular diseases were regis-tered more often - in 8 (26, 6 %) and in the control group - 4 (13, 3 %). In women with a reduced lac-tational function there is a high frequency of dis-orders in menstrual cycle and salpingo-oophoritis in the anamnesis: in the main group - in 21 (70 %) and 19 (63, 3 %); in the control group - in 4 (13, 3 %) and 5 (16, 6 %) correspondingly (p< 0, 05). Incompe¬tent pregnancy in the anamnesis as a factor causing hypogalactia was registered in 53, 3 % women from the main group. In the majority of women in labor from the main group having hypogalactia there was a thread of abortion - 14 (46, 6 %), gestosis - in 10 (33, 3 %), anemia - in 27 (40 %); placental insuffi-ciency in 12 (40 %), in the control group - in 16, 6; 3, 3; 53, 3 and 6, 6 % cases correspondingly. The most serious intranatal factors for disorders of lactational function after labor were anomalies of labor activity and blood loss over 500 ml that were registered in both groups with almost similar fre¬quency. Both in the main and control groups there weren’t found out any authentic significant perinatal factors among full-term neonates that wound influ¬ence the formation of lactation in postnatal period. The formation of lactation during first 5 days after labor is influenced by the woman’s somatic health condition, her obstetrical-gynecologist status, ob¬stetrical complications which were registered more frequently in women from the main group that’s why we have suggested recovery of lactation¬al function in this group of patients by means of «Shirafza» phytomedication, that is a natural meth-od of high quality based on vegetable raw material which due to complex effect on the woman’s organ¬ism stimulates all stages of lactation, prevents prob¬lems of overweight in feedings mothers and rise of glucose level in blood. Shirafza effect is conditioned by herbs in its composition. Fennel (Foeniculum Mill) contains the mixture of trans-anethol with fenhon, estragol and other components. Structural resemblance of anethol and catecholamine can sup¬port estrogenic activity. Dopamin has a stimulating effect on lactation, in this way anethol can cause milk production re-sponding to dopamine on the determined sections of receptors. Due to this the effect of dopamine de-creases in stimulating milk production. Biologically active substances in Fennel composition stimulate lactogenous action in feeding mothers and also re-move evidences of meteorism, improve digestion release spasms and mobility of the intestine. Caraway provides the increase of milk amount and its nutritional qualities. Trigonella manyco- loured improves bloodflow in the mammary gland, stimulates lactatation and provides the increase of nutritional value of breast milk. Common dill (anethum graveolens) has a seda-tive and soothing action, so women in childbirth are less anxious and its anti-inflammatory action dimin¬ishes the risk of mastitis occurrence. Alcaloids of common dill only increase the amount and quality of breast milk, but in interaction with other compo¬nents of «Shirafza» pass over together with moth¬er’s milk to the infant and prevent meteorism in this way and release abdominal pain (colics) in a breast¬fed infant. The preparation was taken by women from the main group because they complainted mostly of insufficient milk production. The preparation was-taken from the 4 -th day of postnatal period by 1 capsule three times a day. 25 women-in labor (83, 3 %) were marked down to increase the volume of milk on the 5 - 6 th day of the in¬takes as well as to improve milk quality which manifest¬ed inself in the absence of dry «swaddling clothes» syn¬drome, the baby was actively sucking mother’s breast, the woman in childbirth felt the rush of milk, the infant didn’t cry of began to gain weight actively. Conclusions. Women in childbirth show a high frequency of complications in postnatal period (73, 3 %), that is significantly higher than the analogous index in the control group (40 %) Usage of «Shirafza» preparation contributes to the improvement of lactational function in wom¬en in childbirth already on the 5 -th day of postnatal period.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{position}} {{myself in the}} discussion {{about the relationship between}} literature and philosophy by agreeing with Leavis and Van Stralen, that finding philosophical elements in a text should not be the aim of a research, but the beginning. I follow Van Stralen in his hermeneutic model by focusing on how existentialist elements in Kundera’s two novels can help understand the two texts in a better way. Thus my main question is not only “Can Milan Kundera’s novels The Unbearable Lightness of Being and Immortality be seen as literary existentialist texts?”, but also “Does this help, and if so how does this help, to clarify and interpret these texts?”. I also follow Van Stralen by making a distinction between philosophical existentialism and literary existentialism. Doing this I opposed Flynn who disregards this division by pondering on the question whether existentialism is solely a philosophical or literary movement. To find an answer to my first main question. “Can Milan Kundera’s novels The Unbearable Lightness of Being and Immortality be seen as literary existentialist texts?”, I discuss a number of existentialist aspects derived from philosophical and literary existentialism and ask myself in which way these aspects correspond with and differ from the existentialist concepts Flynn and Van Stralen talk about. Concerning authenticity, bad faith and good faith I show a distinction between authenticity and inauthenticity which in Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being is represented in the contrast between Tereza (<b>featuring</b> <b>authenticity,</b> good faith, having a soul, shame, and the unique and irreplaceable body) and Tereza’s mother (featuring inauthenticity, bad faith, soullessness, not understanding, not experiencing and banning shame, and the identicalness and sameness of bodies). Thus here many similarities can be found between the existentialist concepts in philosophical and literary existentialism and these concepts in Kundera’s novels. 	The important existentialist concept of the Other and the Other’s gaze can also clearly be found in the two novels; characters need and long for the gaze, and they are also forced into a confrontation with the Other through the gaze. A striking difference however is that this gaze often appears in a different way than a human eye looking directly at another human; for example as a gaze from someone who is not present or as an indirect gaze. 	The body is an existentialist concept that plays a big role in The Unbearable Lightness of Being and Immortality. The existentialist statement that a person is his or her body brings along the returning motif of the question of duality or unity of body and soul is in Kundera’s novels. A recurring pondering by Kundera’s characters is how they can link their soul, their “I” or their self to their body. Tereza and Agnes for example stare at their face in the mirror to find the essence of their selves. This reminds us of phenomenological reduction. The biggest difference between Tereza’s and Agnes’ phenomenological experience of countering their face as a phenomenon and grasping the essence of it through reduction and the ‘traditional’ phenomenological experience is that the two women do not experience contingency or feel nausea. Tereza, for example, on the contrary, rejoices when it happens. 	Another existentialist distinction that appears in Kundera’s work is the distinction between existing as a human and as a thing (Sartre: ‘être-pour-soi’ and ‘être-en-soi’). In Immortality Agnes makes this distinction with the terms “being one’s self”/“living” and “being”. A difference between the existentialist concept and the concept in Kundera’s text is however, just {{as in the case of}} the body and phenomenological reduction, a difference in value judgement. For Agnes existing as a thing is happiness: “there is nothing more beautiful. ” (Kundera 1992 : 288), while for existentialists this is seen as bad faith. 	Van Stralen states that small spaces are places where individuals are forced to confront the Other. In Kundera’s novels small spaces can be found that correspond with this idea. However, other small spaces in Kundera’s novel do not correspond with Van Stralen’s idea. : some of Kundera’s characters tend to desire small space precisely because they are places where they can escape from the Other and the Other’s gaze or because they are places where the character can directly respond to the Other. 	In my research I discuss two unique literary existentialist characteristic of Kundera’s novels (which Flynn and Van Stralen do not mention). The first is humiliation. In the case of this emotion the Other plays an active role (in contrast to the case of shame), thus humiliation is even more closely linked to the Other than shame. I have suggested humiliation to be the emotion that triggers characters to take the leap to authenticity. It forces us to realise we can choose what we are: it forces us to choose for good faith. This is why characters sometimes long for humiliation: they long for an opportunity to change their bad faith into good faith. 	The second existentialist feature that characterises Kundera’s texts is the theme of gestures, which can be derived from the existentialist concept of the body. In several instances the narrators of the two novels stand still to elaborate on a character’s gesture: they describe the movement and ponder on what the gesture means. The main question Kundera’s narrators and characters muse on is whether gestures reflect the essence of a person, or whether a small number of ‘standard’ gestures are used by everyone and say nothing about a person’s essence. We can understand this theme as a discussion by Kundera’s narrators and characters about the existentialist notion of “existence precedes essence” in the case of gestures. They do not agree on whether this existentialist notion is the case, or whether in the case of gestures it is turned around into “essence precedes existence”. 	Thus, due to many existentialist aspects that can be found and understood in an existentialist way in The Unbearable Lightness of Being and Immortality I believe these texts by Milan Kundera can be seen as literary existentialist texts. However, because some existentialist characteristics differ slightly from their ‘traditional’ form and because unique literary existentialist themes can be found in Kundera’s novels such as humiliation and gestures, we should approach Kundera’s two novels as examples of ‘Kundera’s literary existentialism’, which is something different than the ‘traditional’ literary existentialism known from for example literature by Sartre and Camus. To answer my second main question, “Does this help, and if so how does this help, to clarify and interpret these texts?”, I discuss ways in which using existentialist concepts help in understanding Kundera’s two novels. Firstly, I use the concept of existential anguish to clarify the narrator’s notion of “vertigo” in The Unbearable Lightness of Being. By analysing this notion a distinction becomes clear between Tereza and authenticity on one side, and the world of her mother and friends and inauthenticity on the other side. Due to this existentialist concept we understand that weakness lures Tereza back to the bad faith she escaped from when she left her mother to move in with Tomas. In Kundera’s novel this urge is described as “the longing to fall”. 	The existentialist distinction between good faith and bad faith helps us understand why Kundera’s narrators and characters condemn inauthentic behaviour such as not-choosing and living in wishfulness. Other forms of bad faith that can be found in Kundera’s novels are fleeing one’s responsibility by pointing to one’s condition and ‘being-for-others’. Living in good faith is also portrayed in the two novels, for example not choosing for ‘being-for-others’, and embracing contingency. 	The concepts of the Other and the Other’s gaze help us interpret Tereza’s notion of the concentration camp in The Unbearable Lightness of Being. To clarify this I use Van Stralen’s claim that in existentialist literature there is often a need for a confrontation with the Other because authenticity can be the outcome of such a confrontation. An example of such a borderline situation is the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia which causes Tereza to turn to Sartrean commitment. This makes Tereza an authentic, committed individual. Just as the existentialists she believes you are not born an authentic individual, but that becoming an individual is an achievement. 	Thus, defining Kundera’s two novels as literary existentialist texts results in the fact that certain parts of Unbearable Lightness of Being and Immortality can be clarified and interpreted in a better way. This means combining the work of Milan Kundera with the philosophy of existentialism not only has the aim to find similarities between the literature and the philosophy, a fallacy both Leavis and Van Stralen mentioned, but also uses the philosophy to interpret the literature, something Van Stralen proposed with his hermeneutic model...|$|R
