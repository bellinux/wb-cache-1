5|$|Themes {{of class}} {{consciousness}} and conflict are {{also present in}} the book. Critics interpreted the stance the novel took against French class-based discrimination and hypocrisy <b>as</b> <b>quite</b> radical, although some French critics found that this made the novel an unsubtle satire of fading social stereotypes. There are also literary allusions in the novel, referencing comic books, movies, music, and paintings.|$|E
5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{suggests that}} if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others <b>as</b> <b>quite</b> an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|Worst {{affected}} was German Samoa, {{today the}} independent state of Samoa, {{which had been}} occupied by New Zealand in 1914. A crippling 90% {{of the population was}} infected; 30% of adult men, 22% of adult women and 10% of children died. By contrast, the flu was kept away from American Samoa when Governor John Martin Poyer imposed a blockade. In New Zealand itself, 8,573 deaths were attributed to the 1918 pandemic influenza, resulting in a total population fatality rate of 0.74%. In Ireland, the Spanish Flu accounted for 10% of the total deaths in 1918 which can be seen <b>as</b> <b>quite</b> detrimental considering World War 1 was still occurring.|$|E

5|$|The {{common law}} is, however, capable of {{evolving}} {{in the light}} of changing social, economic and cultural developments. Hale's proposition reflected the state of affairs in these respects {{at the time it was}} enunciated. Since then the status of women, and particularly of married women, has changed out of all recognition in various ways which are very familiar and upon which it is unnecessary to go into detail. Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes is that marriage is in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife must be the subservient chattel of the husband. Hale's proposition involves that by marriage a wife gives her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happens to be feeling at the time. In modern times any reasonable person must regard that conception <b>as</b> <b>quite</b> unacceptable.|$|E

25|$|In July 2016, Barroso became non-executive {{chairman}} of London-based Goldman Sachs International (GSI), the bank's largest subsidiary. He {{will also be}} {{an adviser to the}} bank.

25|$|According to Geoffrey Summers, the {{movement}} of Kura-Araxes peoples into Iran and the Van region, which he interprets <b>as</b> <b>quite</b> sudden, started shortly before 3000 BC, {{and may have been}} prompted by the 'Late Uruk Collapse' (end of the Uruk period), taking place at the end of Uruk IV phase c. 3100 BC.|$|E
25|$|A couple {{stopped at}} Seascape and Bryant met them outside. When they {{asked if they}} could {{have a look at the}} accommodation, Bryant told them that they could not because his parents were away and his girlfriend was inside. His {{demeanor}} was described <b>as</b> <b>quite</b> rude and the couple felt uncomfortable. They left at about 12:35p.m. Bryant's car was seen reversed up to the front door. It is assumed he unloaded ammunition.|$|E

25|$|On Saturday 21 July 1945 the {{regiment}} took its place behind the vehicles of the Royal Horse Artillery as second most senior army regiment on parade. The parade commenced 20 minutes late at 10:50. Promoted to captain in August 1945 Bellamy went on extended leave {{from what he}} describes <b>as</b> <b>quite</b> a leisurely life in Berlin which ended before his return as {{the regiment}} was moved to Itzehoe in Schleswig-Holstein.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to most other sauropods, brachiosaurids had an inclined back, {{due to their}} long forelimbs. Therefore, if the neck exited the body in a straight line, it already pointed upwards. The exact angle is influenced by how the pectoral girdle is reconstructed, {{that is how the}} shoulder blades are placed on the ribcage. The mobility of the neck was reconstructed <b>as</b> <b>quite</b> low by Stevens and Parrish, while other researchers like Paul and Christian and Dzemski argued for more flexible necks.|$|E
25|$|The work of Nikolai Roslavets, {{unlike that}} of Prokofiev and Stravinsky, is often seen as a direct {{extension}} of Scriabin's. Unlike Scriabin's, however, Roslavets' music was not explained with mysticism and eventually was given theoretical explication by the composer. Roslavets {{was not alone in}} his innovative extension of Scriabin's musical language, however, <b>as</b> <b>quite</b> a few Soviet composers and pianists such as Samuil Feinberg, Sergei Protopopov, Nikolai Myaskovsky, and Alexander Mosolov followed this legacy until Stalinist politics quelled it in favor of Socialist Realism.|$|E

25|$|The term {{elementary}} generally denotes {{a method}} that does not use complex analysis. For example, the prime number theorem was first proven using complex analysis in 1896, but an elementary proof was found only in 1949 by Erdős and Selberg. The term is somewhat ambiguous: for example, proofs based on complex Tauberian theorems (e.g. Wiener–Ikehara) are often seen <b>as</b> <b>quite</b> enlightening but not elementary, in spite of using Fourier analysis, rather than complex analysis as such. Here as elsewhere, an elementary proof may be longer and more difficult for most readers than a non-elementary one.|$|E
25|$|The turn of {{the century}} saw the {{domination}} of Pudsey Congs and Woodlands within the top division. Pudsey Congs won five consecutive titles between 2000 and 2004, and Woodlands won the following four titles. The only other team to win the title since 2000 is Baildon, who were victorious in 2009. Woodlands are the current champions, and their five titles could be considered <b>as</b> <b>quite</b> a feat as they were only readmitted to the League in 2001 (they previously spent two seasons in the second division in 1910 and 1911).|$|E
25|$|In lesbian feminist Marilyn Frye's (1978) essay Notes on Separatism and Power she posits female {{separatism}} as {{a strategy}} practiced by all women, at some point, and present in many feminist projects (one might cite women's refuges, electoral quotas or Women's Studies programmes). She argues {{that it is only}} when women practice it, self-consciously as separation from men, that it is treated with controversy (or as she suggests hysteria). Male separatism on the other hand (one might cite gentleman's clubs, labor unions, sports teams, the military and, more arguably, decision-making positions in general) is seen <b>as</b> <b>quite</b> a normal, even expedient phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|It {{is notable}} {{that as the}} context in which the {{characters}} evolved, Michel also is shown getting older. While he looked like a young man of about twenty years at the beginning of his adventures, he is seen progressively reaching middle-age. Recently his appearance is younger than previously. Other fictional characters are also shown getting older. In recent years, their general appearance has become steady. In spite of this he is still depicted <b>as</b> <b>quite</b> young for a man who has competed against drivers of multiple generations, including Juan Manuel Fangio, Graham Hill and Ayrton Senna.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, Ludwig {{finished the}} construction of the royal apartment in the Residenz Palace in Munich, to which he had added an opulent conservatory or winter garden on the palace roof. It was started in 1867 <b>as</b> <b>quite</b> a small structure, but after extensions in 1868 and 1871, the dimensions reached 69.5mx17.2mx9.5m high. It featured an ornamental lake complete with skiff, a painted panorama of the Himalayas as a backdrop, an Indian fisher-hut of bamboo, a Moorish kiosk, and an exotic tent. The roof was a technically advanced metal and glass construction. The winter garden was closed in June 1886, partly dismantled the following year and demolished in 1897.|$|E
25|$|He {{has been}} {{mentioned}} to being a hard working Toad with a strong loyalty to his Princess and friends. In many games, such as Super Mario 64, Toad is helpful to Mario and his crew on their search for Peach, despite the fact Toad is portrayed <b>as</b> <b>quite</b> a shy character. In Luigi's Mansion, he is seen crying in certain places because he cares so much about Mario getting kidnapped by ghosts, {{he was sent to}} the mansion to look for Mario in commands of Princess Peach. He was extremely loyal because he was scared and feared that he could get captured too. In , five colored Toads are trapped in paintings by King Boo.|$|E
