Eventually, when the filming crew left the room, the group managed {{to finish the}} song. Stannards commented about the inspiration behind it to Music Week: [...] "We were talking about Bollywood films, the colours and how the Spice Girls could present themselves. It was <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> do we get everything in to one song?" [...] All the writing and the vocal recording was completed in one afternoon, and instead of taking turns, the five members went inside the vocal booths and recorded the chorus together.

Iñigo Zabala, chairman of Warner Music Latin America commented that [...] "He's an artist that fits perfectly with our company," [...] and that [...] "We are a label that has a major catalog of songwriters and quality pop and rock from the likes of Maná, Alejandro Sanz, Laura Pausini, and now, Arjona." [...] In an interview, the singer commented that while composing 5to Piso he [...] "tried to recoup some of the freshness" [...] of his past releases, stating that [...] "it makes so good to the songs". He further stated that he believes [...] "all albums are result of an evolution, and contradictions either", also stating that he celebrated contradictions as part of life. Arjona begun working on the album as early as 2005. Talking about the process of recording the album, he stated that [...] "We must work to make the albums comfortable to us", further commenting that [...] "The rest is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> good or bad the albums defend themselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the 1970s Davidson's {{philosophy}} of mind picked up influences {{from the work}} of Saul Kripke, Hilary Putnam, and Keith Donnellan, all of whom had proposed a number of troubling counterexamples to what can be generally described as [...] "descriptivist" [...] theories of content. The views, which roughly originate in Bertrand Russell's Theory of Descriptions, held that the referent of a name, which object or person the name refers to, is determined by the beliefs a person holds about that object. Kripke et al. argued {{that this was not a}} tenable theory, and that in fact whom or what a person's beliefs were about was in large part (or entirely) <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> they had acquired those beliefs, and those names, and how if at all the use of those names could be traced [...] "causally" [...] from their original referents to the current speaker.|$|E

50|$|While {{growing on}} media in which growth rates are low, cAMP binds to a cAMP Receptor Protein(CRP) forming a CRP-cAMP complex which has {{regulatory}} properties. This complex binds to a region 100 bp upstream of the guaB transcription start site which then represses the gua operon. It is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> debate <b>of</b> <b>how</b> this complex interacts with RNA Polymerase(RNAP) from {{as long as}} around 100 bit/s away.
