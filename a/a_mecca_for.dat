25|$|The Palace (previously The Palace Cinema, The Rhythm Station, Cheeks, Vox), {{influenced}} {{the rapid growth}} of the hardcore scene from 1992 to 1995.

The club also groomed local talents such as DJ Sharkey, DJ Mystery, DJ Sy, DJ Unknown, Vinylgroover, DJ NS, Hixxy, MC Freestyle, MC Young, MC Smiley and of course the Spyder MC who in 2004 became the voice of carton Spiderman. The location of Aldershot between Southampton and London meant the club became <b>a</b> <b>mecca</b> <b>for</b> Hardcore and it was regularly sold out during this time. At the height of the club's popularity, a teenager's death from a suspected overdose of Ecstasy was the catalyst that saw dance music leaving the club and had a negative impact on the hardcore dance scene in the Aldershot area.|$|E
25|$|Squamish {{is a minor}} {{deepwater}} port. It was {{the original}} southern terminus of the BCR {{in the days when}} it was the Pacific Great Eastern, and had a busy ferry terminal where travellers would disembark from ferries and steamers bringing them in from Vancouver harbour. In the 1960s what was then called the Squamish Highway was finally pushed through from Vancouver. This made the former steamer service unnecessary. Once a thriving forestry town, with recent cutbacks in logging along with the closure and dismantling of a major sawmill in 2004, Squamish has become a tourist destination and a commuter community for workers in nearby Whistler and Vancouver. The recent closure of the Woodfibre pulp mill in 2006 signals an end to the resource based economy here. Squamish is a world centre for rock climbing, with the 1500' bulk of the Stawamus Chief, a huge rock formation always busy with climbers, along with other formations overlooking downtown and the head of Howe Sound. In addition,the strong winds and flat waters at the upper end of Howe Sound have made Squamish <b>a</b> <b>mecca</b> <b>for</b> windsurfers, kite boarders and keelboat sailors.|$|E
