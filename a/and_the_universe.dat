5|$|Meher Baba's teachings can roughly {{be divided}} into two main categories: his metaphysics {{on the nature of the}} soul <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe,</b> and {{practical}} advice for the spiritual aspirant. The two are interrelated. His metaphysics is mostly found in his principal book on the subject, God Speaks. It contains detailed statements on his cosmology and the purpose of life as well as the progression of the soul, while his elucidations on the practical spiritual life are mostly contained in Discourses, although it also covers many metaphysical areas mirroring or amplifying God Speaks.|$|E

Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of creation, with a will and purpose that is expressed through messengers termed Manifestations of God.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} last {{scattering}} corresponding to emission of the CMB occurs shortly after recombination, the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes stable. Prior to this, the universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly scattered from free charged particles.

5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{fate of the}} Universe {{is still}} unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index k and the cosmological constant Λ. If the Universe were sufficiently dense, k would equal +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> will eventually recollapse in a Big Crunch, possibly starting a new Universe in a Big Bounce. Conversely, if the Universe were insufficiently dense, k would equal 0 or −1 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the Big Freeze and the heat death of the Universe. Modern data suggests {{that the rate of}} expansion of the Universe is not decreasing, as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, the Universe may eventually reach a Big Rip. Observationally, the Universe appears to be flat (k = 0), with an overall density that is very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion.|$|E

5|$|As per Tulsidas, Rama is the {{efficient}} and material cause (Nimitta and Upadana) of the world, which is real since Rama is real. In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas {{says that the}} animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses to mean {{that the world is}} real according to Tulsidas, in keeping with the Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja. However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is Mithya (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses to mean that in Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the Vivartavada doctrine of Adi Shankara, while some others interpret them to mean that the world is transient yet real as per the Satkhyativada doctrine of Ramananda. Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to Maya. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by Mithya.|$|E
5|$|Third, the {{curvature}} index k determines {{the sign of}} the mean spatial curvature of spacetime averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion light years). If k=1, {{the curvature}} is positive <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> has a finite volume. Such universes are often visualized as a three-dimensional sphere embedded in a four-dimensional space. Conversely, if k is zero or negative, the Universe has infinite volume. It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when R=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when k does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a torus is finite in both. A toroidal Universe could behave like a normal Universe with periodic boundary conditions.|$|E

Rabbi Aharon's first book, Sha'arei HaYichud ve'Ha'emuna (The Gates of Unity and Faith), {{is based on the}} section of Tanya of a similar name. In it, Rabbi Aharon argues that the {{corresponding}} part of Tanya was incomplete, and that it is therefore necessary to learn his book in order to understand it fully. Sha'arei HaYichud v'HaEmuna focuses on the creation of <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe's</b> relationship with God. It develops the concept of pele (wonder), which refers to the paradox caused by God's <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe's</b> simultaneous existence. It then argues that one will never [...] "understand" [...] God, because God is incomparable with created existence. Therefore, the closest thing man can come to [...] "grasping" [...] God is to meditate on <b>the</b> pele , <b>and</b> to constantly desire to understand God further. The book further elaborates on the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> God, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ten Sefiros.|$|R

25|$|Young Earth creationists such as Ken Ham and Doug Phillips {{believe that}} God created the Earth {{within the last}} ten {{thousand}} years, literally {{as described in the}} Genesis creation narrative, within the approximate time-frame of biblical genealogies (detailed for example in the Ussher chronology). Most young Earth creationists believe that the universe has a similar age as the Earth. A few assign a much older age to the universe than to Earth. Creationist cosmologies give the universe an age consistent with the Ussher chronology and other young Earth time frames. Other young Earth creationists believe that the Earth <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> were created with the appearance of age, so that the world appears to be much older than it is, and that this appearance is what gives the geological findings and other methods of dating the Earth <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> their much longer timelines.|$|E
