5|$|Sodium ferrocyanide, {{also known}} as yellow prussiate of soda, is {{sometimes}} added to salt as an <b>anticaking</b> agent. The additive is considered safe for human consumption. Such anti-caking agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more freely. The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive {{was found to be}} provisionally acceptable by the Committee on Toxicity in 1988. Other <b>anticaking</b> agents sometimes used include tricalcium phosphate, calcium or magnesium carbonates, fatty acid salts (acid salts), magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate. Both the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration permitted the use of aluminium in the latter two compounds.|$|E
5|$|Grit {{is often}} mixed with hydrous sodium {{ferrocyanide}} as an <b>anticaking</b> agent which, while harmless {{in its natural}} form, can undergo photodissociation in strong sunlight to produce the extremely toxic chemical hydrogen cyanide. Although sunlight is generally not intense enough to cause this in polar and temperate regions, salt deposits must kept {{as far as possible}} from waterways to avert the possibility of cyanide-tainted runoff water entering fisheries or farms.|$|E
25|$|Powdered, 10X sugar, confectioner's sugar (0.060mm), or {{icing sugar}} (0.024mm), {{produced}} by grinding sugar {{to a fine}} powder. The manufacturer may add {{a small amount of}} <b>anticaking</b> agent to prevent clumping— either cornstarch (1% to 3%) or tri-calcium phosphate.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{stability}} of their complexation with iron, ferrocyanides (Sodium ferrocyanide E535, Potassium ferrocyanide E536, and Calcium ferrocyanide E538) do not decompose to lethal levels {{in the human body}} and are used in the food industry as, e.g., an <b>anticaking</b> agent in table salt.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{carbonate}} is a food additive (E500) {{used as an}} acidity regulator, <b>anticaking</b> agent, raising agent, and stabilizer. It is one of {{the components}} of , a solution of alkaline salts used to give ramen noodles their characteristic flavor and texture. It is also used in the production of snus (Swedish-style snuff) to stabilize the pH of the final product.|$|E
25|$|As a food {{additive}} it is designated E170; INS number 170. Used as an acidity regulator, <b>anticaking</b> agent, stabiliser or colour it {{is approved}} for usage in the EU, USA and Australia and New Zealand. It {{is used in}} some soy milk and almond milk products {{as a source of}} dietary calcium; one study suggests that calcium carbonate might be as bioavailable as the calcium in cow's milk. Calcium carbonate is also used as a firming agent in many canned or bottled vegetable products.|$|E
500|$|Salt is {{essential}} to the health of humans and other animals, and {{it is one of the}} five basic taste sensations. Salt is used in many cuisines around the world, and it is often found in salt shakers on diners' eating tables for their personal use on food. [...] Salt is also an ingredient in many manufactured foodstuffs. Table salt is a refined salt containing about 97 to 99percent sodium chloride. Usually, <b>anticaking</b> agents such as sodium aluminosilicate or magnesium carbonate are added to make it free-flowing. Iodized salt, containing potassium iodide, is widely available. Some people put a desiccant, such as a few grains of uncooked rice or a saltine cracker, in their salt shakers to absorb extra moisture and help break up salt clumps that may otherwise form.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anticaking</b> agents : <b>Anticaking</b> agents keep powders such as {{milk powder}} from caking or sticking.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>anticaking</b> {{agent in}} salt is denoted in the ingredients, for example, as [...] "anti-caking agent (554)", which is sodium aluminosilicate, a {{man-made}} product. This product {{is present in}} many commercial table salts as well as dried milk, egg mixes, sugar products, flours and spices. In Europe, sodium ferrocyanide (535) and potassium ferrocyanide (536) are more common <b>anticaking</b> agents in table salt. [...] "Natural" [...] <b>anticaking</b> agents used in more expensive table salt include calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate.|$|E
50|$|The {{most widely}} used <b>anticaking</b> agents include the stearates of calcium and magnesium, silica and various silicates, talc, as well as flour and starch.

5000|$|Azomite is used {{primarily}} as a natural feed <b>anticaking</b> agent and remineralizer for depleted soils. Hydrated Sodium Calcium Aluminosilicate (HSCAS), its primary component, is listed in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 582.2729) as an <b>anticaking</b> agent for livestock feed and is {{generally recognized as safe}} (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Agriculture and livestock producers have used Azomite to support livestock health and plant nutrition for over seventy years. While it contains minute quantities of naturally occurring contaminants, Azomite falls well within the guidelines for use in animal feed by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.|$|E
50|$|Natural {{freshwater}} {{diatomaceous earth}} {{is used in}} agriculture for grain storage as an <b>anticaking</b> agent, {{as well as an}} insecticide. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a feed additive to prevent caking.|$|E

50|$|In some countries, {{especially}} those in Europe, dishwashers include a built-in water softener that removes calcium and magnesium ions from the water. Dishwasher salt, which is coarse-grained sodium chloride (table salt), is used to recharge the resin in the built-in ion-exchange system. The coarse grains prevent it from clogging the softener unit; unlike certain types of salt used for culinary purposes, it does not contain added insoluble <b>anticaking</b> agents or magnesium salts. The presence of magnesium salts will defeat the purpose of removing magnesium from the water softener. <b>Anticaking</b> agents may lead to clogging or may contain magnesium. Table salt may contain added iodine {{in the form of}} sodium iodide or potassium iodide. These compounds will not affect the ion-exchange system, but adding table salt to the dishwasher's water softening unit can damage it.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>anticaking</b> {{agents are}} soluble in water, {{while others are}} soluble in {{alcohols}} or other organic solvents. They function either by absorbing excess moisture or by coating particles and making them water-repellent. Calcium silicate (CaSiO3), a commonly used anti-caking agent, added to e.g. table salt, absorbs both water and oil.|$|E
50|$|The {{ingredients}} in the Australian and New Zealand cinnamon product are sorbitol, flavor, <b>anticaking</b> agent (470), sweeteners (955, 950) and colours (129, 133); while the orange product contains food acid (330), sweetener (951) (instead of 950), and colours (102, 129) (instead of 129, 133). The orange product advises that it contains Phenylalanine.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to table salt, which often has iodide {{as well as}} <b>anticaking</b> ingredients, special canning and pickling salt is made for producing the brine {{to be used in}} pickling vegetables and other foodstuffs. This salt has no iodine added because the iodide can be oxidised by the foods and darken them—a harmless but aesthetically undesirable effect.|$|E
50|$|This {{swelling}} property makes montmorillonite-containing bentonite useful also as an annular seal or plug for water wells {{and as a}} protective liner for landfills. Other uses include as an <b>anticaking</b> agent in animal feed, in paper making to minimize deposit formation, and as a retention and drainage aid component. Montmorillonite has also been used in cosmetics.|$|E
5000|$|Other uses (hundreds of {{thousands}} of tons/year) include ceramics (decrease the viscosity of glazes {{up to a certain}} limit), leather tanning (as masking agent and synthetic tanning agent - SYNTAN), <b>anticaking,</b> setting retarders, flame retardants, paper, anticorrosion pigments, textiles, rubber manufacture, fermentation, antifreeze." [...] TPP is used as a polyanion crosslinker in polysaccharide based drug delivery.|$|E
50|$|Potassium {{ferrocyanide}} finds many niche {{applications in}} industry. It {{and the related}} sodium salt are widely used as <b>anticaking</b> agents for both road salt and table salt. The potassium and sodium ferrocyanides are also used in the purification of tin and the separation of copper from molybdenum ores. Potassium ferrocyanide {{is used in the}} production of wine and citric acid.|$|E
