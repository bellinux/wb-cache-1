5|$|A 2007 {{study of}} young chess {{players in the}} United Kingdom found that strong players tended to have above-average IQ scores, but, within that group, the {{correlation}} between chess skill and IQ was moderately negative, meaning that smarter children tended to achieve <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> chess skill. This result was explained by a negative correlation between intelligence and practice in the elite subsample, and by practice having a higher influence on chess skill.|$|E

5|$|Hazelwood School District et al. v.

Another First Amendment case in public schools came up in 1998, when E.D. Mo. heard Beussink v. Woodland R-IV School District. Judge Rodney W. Sippel ruled that the school violated a student's rights by sanctioning him for material he posted on his website. This case has been widely cited in higher courts.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} found that urban populations of common toad occupying small areas and {{isolated}} by development show <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> genetic diversity and reduced fitness as compared to nearby rural populations. The researchers demonstrated this by genetic analysis and by noting the greater number of physical abnormalities among urban as against rural tadpoles when raised in a controlled environment. It was considered that long term depletion in numbers and habitat fragmentation can reduce population persistence in such urban environments.|$|E

40|$|The {{comprehensive}} {{head injury}} service {{run by the}} neurosurgeons at the Hull Royal Infirmary for the surrounding population of one million was analysed. The analysis showed that all patients with either a fractured skull or <b>a</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> consciousness should be admitted to a district general hospital because the associated risk of their having a major head injury is over 20 %. Those patients with both a fractured skull and <b>a</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> consciousness have <b>a</b> 60 % likelihood of a major head injury and should be transferred immediately to the neurosurgical unit. Patients with compound or complicated fractures of the skull and those without fractured skulls but with neurological impairment persisting for four hours or more, should also {{be transferred to the}} neurosurgical unit. If these guidelines are followed about 200 patients/million population will be referred to the neurosurgical centre. Patients with a minor head injury and none of the clinical risk factors may safely be sent home. This should reduce the rate of admissions to hospital for head injuries by 60 %...|$|R
5|$|Sometimes {{in areas}} where the new wages were applied, {{factories}} would struggle to recruit workers for important tasks because the reform had given a low pay grade to a task that was considered to require <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> skill. For example, machine-tool operation was given a low pay grade, and at one factory in Kotlyakov some 30 machine-tools sat unused as factory managers were unable to recruit workers to operate them.|$|E
5|$|Although St. Louis {{enforced}} {{a variety}} of Jim Crow laws, the area generally had <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> racial violence and fewer lynchings than the American South. The St. Louis black community was stable and relatively concentrated along the riverfront or near the railroad yards. Although informal discrimination had existed in the St. Louis housing market {{since the end of}} the Civil War, only in 1916 did St. Louis pass a residential segregation ordinance. The ordinance quickly was invalidated by court injunctions, but private restrictive covenants in St. Louis real estate transactions limited the ability of white owners to sell to blacks and were another form of racial discrimination. In 1948 the U.S. Supreme Court overturned such real estate limitations as unconstitutional in Shelley v. Kraemer, a court case based on the sale of a St. Louis house (the Shelley House) to a black family.|$|E
5|$|Each of the {{branches}} of the ADF has a reserve component. These forces are the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Australian Army Reserve and Royal Australian Air Force Reserve. The main role of the reserves is to supplement the permanent elements of the ADF during deployments and crises, including natural disasters. This can include attaching individual reservists to regular units or deploying units composed entirely of reserve personnel. As reservists serve on a part-time basis, they are less costly to the government than permanent members of the ADF, but the nature of their service can mean that reservists have <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> readiness than regular personnel and require further training before they can be deployed. It has historically proven difficult to set a level of training requirements which allows reservists to be rapidly deployable yet does not act as a disincentive to recruitment and continued participation.|$|E

5|$|Lōʻihi is {{following}} the pattern of development that is characteristic of all Hawaiʻian volcanoes. Geochemical evidence from Lōʻihi lavas indicates that Lōʻihi is in transition between the preshield and shield volcano stage, providing valuable clues to the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. In the preshield stage, Hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides and <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> activity, producing an alkali basalt lava. Continued volcanism is expected to eventually create an island at Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi experiences frequent landslides; {{the growth of the}} volcano has destabilized its slopes, and extensive areas of debris inhabit the steep southeastern face. Similar deposits from other Hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. Lōʻihi is predicted to rise above the surface in 10,000 to 100,000 years.|$|E

Thanks to the hormone injections Rosie has had, it only took a day for Lilith to be born and she will age one year, every day, and take Callie's place as Twayne's bride. After an accident caused by Lilith, Rosie is hospitalized and Mark and Callie {{take on the task}} to raise Lilith. In just a few weeks, she is eighteen years old and has started dating Randall. Mark takes in Twayne for a session and finds out about his arranged marriage to Lilith, and that the marriage will be a televised sex ritual. Callie realizes that she is forcing Lilith to marry Twayne, just like her father forced her, and tells Lilith that she does not want her to marry him. Lilith, however, wants to the opposite of what Callie wants and tells her that she will marry him. Just before the ritual is about to commence, Lilith reveals to Mark that she plots to kill Callie and Twayne and instead join Mark at the sex altar. Mark informs Callie, who takes out her soul to transform into a more demonic figure. Following a battle between the two, Lilith falls down to <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Hell.
