5|$|On October 8, 2009, Randazza {{was interviewed}} {{about the case}} on the WPRR radio program, Declaring Independence. He {{explained}} why Beck did not file a libel lawsuit in the United States. He pointed out that because Beck was a public figure he had to prove a legal standard referred to as <b>actual</b> <b>malice,</b> and show that Eiland-Hall knew his assertions were inaccurate. He explained that this {{did not apply to}} Eiland-Hall's website even if it was knowingly inaccurate, because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell that no proof is needed for an absurd statement made in the context of satire.|$|E
25|$|Milkovich filed suit, {{alleging that}} the {{suggestion}} that he had lied had defamed him. Since perjury is a felony in Ohio, the statements {{were found to be}} defamatory and Milkovich was ruled a private figure, both of which were helpful to his case. However, the trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of the newspaper since it found Diadiun's column to be a statement of opinion, which cannot be libelous, {{and that there was no}} <b>actual</b> <b>malice,</b> per Sullivan. Milkovich appealed to the Ohio Eleventh District Court of Appeals, which found that there was <b>actual</b> <b>malice.</b> In turn, the newspaper appealed to the state Supreme Court, which dismissed it on the grounds that there were no significant constitutional issues. In 1979 the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari.|$|E
25|$|In its February 21, 1983 issue, Time {{published}} an article implying that Sharon was directly responsible for the massacres. Sharon sued Time for libel in American and Israeli courts. Although the jury concluded that the Time article included false allegations, {{they found that the}} magazine had not acted with <b>actual</b> <b>malice</b> and so was not guilty of libel.|$|E
5000|$|Mr. Humphries {{is rarely}} {{shown to have}} a serious {{disagreement}} with his colleagues. Potential disciplinary measures against him are usually {{the result of a}} misunderstanding rather than out of any <b>actual</b> wrongdoing or <b>malice.</b> He is the subject of derisory comments or jokes about his perceived sexuality from Mr. Grainger and Captain Peacock on occasion. In one episode, Mrs Slocombe calls him [...] "fairy cake" [...] and Mr Humphries replies in a hurt voice, [...] "It's all coming out now!" [...] Later in the same episode, the employees are to vote on which of them should be made redundant; each employee receives exactly one nomination with the exception of Mr. Humphries, who simply writes [...] "don't know". As Mr. Rumbold points out, this indicated that Mr. Humphries is the [...] "most popular" [...] person in the department, as nobody voted for him to be made redundant. Despite this, due to his lateness for work, he clashes with Captain Peacock, and due sarcastic and rude comments towards Mrs Slocombe, he clashes with her (although in general, they get along quite well).|$|R
50|$|Qualified {{privilege}} {{attaches to}} the occasion upon which the communication is made, {{and not to the}} communication itself. The legal effect of the defence of qualified privilege is to rebut the inference, which normally arises from the publication of defamatory words, that they were spoken with malice. Where the occasion is shown to be privileged, the bona fides of the defendant is presumed and the defendant is free to publish, with impunity, remarks which may be defamatory and untrue about the plaintiff. The privilege is not absolute, however, and can be defeated if the dominant motive for publishing the statement is <b>actual</b> or express <b>malice.</b> (Malice, in this context, is established by showing the defendant spoke dishonestly, or in knowing or reckless disregard for the truth.) Qualified privilege may also be defeated when the limits of the duty or interest have been exceeded. The fact that an occasion is privileged does not necessarily protect all that is said or written on that occasion. The information communicated must be reasonably appropriate {{in the context of the}} circumstances existing on the occasion when that information was given.|$|R
500|$|In January 2001, a United States {{federal appeals}} court upheld the {{dismissal}} of the Church of Scientology International's case against Time Warner. In its opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that Time Warner had not published [...] "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power" [...] with an <b>actual</b> intent of <b>malice,</b> a standard that must be met for libel cases involving individuals and public groups. On October 1, 2001, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to consider reinstating the church's libel case Church of Scientology International v. Time Warner Inc., 00-1683. Time Warner said it refused to be [...] "intimidated by the church's apparently limitless legal resources." [...] In arguments presented to the Supreme Court, the Church of Scientology acknowledged that church officials had [...] "committed improper acts" [...] in the past, but also claimed that: [...] "allegations of past misconduct were false and distorted, {{the result of the}} misunderstanding, suspicion and prejudice that typically greet a new religion". Of the rulings for Time Warner, the Church of Scientology complained that they [...] "provide a safe harbor for biased journalism". Behar commented on the Church of Scientology's legal defeat, and said that the lawsuit had a chilling effect: [...] "It's a tremendous defeat for Scientology... But of course their doctrine states that the purpose of a suit is to harass, not to win, so from that perspective they hurt us all. They've had a real chilling effect on journalism, both before and after my piece".|$|R
25|$|However, in the {{one aspect}} of the {{decision}} that was favorable to the appellees, the Court also ruled that states could not impose a strict liability standard for defamation (i.e., plaintiffs {{had to be able to}} show fault of some kind) and that juries could not be allowed to award punitive damages, such as the $50,000 Gertz had received, absent any showing of <b>actual</b> <b>malice,</b> since juries could use that power to punish unpopular opinions. A new trial was ordered.|$|E
25|$|On remand, {{the trial}} court issued summary {{judgment}} {{in favor of the}} respondents, this time citing Gertz in ruling the original column to be constitutionally protected opinion. In addition, it said, Milkovich had failed, as a public figure, to establish a prima facie claim of <b>actual</b> <b>malice.</b> The appeals court upheld {{the trial court}} once again, only to be reversed by the Ohio Supreme Court. Another certiorari petition made its way to Washington in 1984, and met with the same fate as its predecessor.|$|E
25|$|At a December 2007 {{rally in}} Little Rock, Arkansas, Maines {{expressed}} support for the West Memphis Three, three men convicted of a 1993 triple murder who many believe to be innocent. Maines cited a recent defense filing implicating Terry Hobbs, the stepfather {{of one of the}} victims, and posted similar comments in a letter on the Dixie Chicks' web site. In November 2008, Hobbs sued Maines and the Dixie Chicks for defamation {{as a result of her}} statements. On December 2, 2009 a U.S. federal judge dismissed the defamation case on the grounds that Hobbs had not shown the statements were made with <b>actual</b> <b>malice.</b>|$|E
25|$|Irving's {{decision}} to file his lawsuit in the English courts {{gave him the}} upper hand by shifting the burden of proof. Under American libel law, a public figure {{who claims to have}} been libelled must prove that the statements in question are defamatory, that they are false, and that they were made with <b>actual</b> <b>malice</b> or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity. Furthermore, reliance on reliable sources (even if they prove false) is a valid defence. In contrast, English libel law requires only that the claimant show that the statements are defamatory. The burden of proof falls on the defendant to prove that the statements were substantially true, and reliance on sources is irrelevant.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court's {{ruling in}} New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964) {{fundamentally}} changed American defamation law. The case redefined {{the type of}} [...] "malice" [...] needed to sustain a libel case. Common law malice consisted of [...] "ill-will" [...] or [...] "wickedness". Now, a public officials seeking to sustain a civil action against a tortfeasor needed to prove by [...] "clear and convincing evidence" [...] that there was <b>actual</b> <b>malice.</b> The case involved an advertisement published in The New York Times indicating that officials in Montgomery, Alabama had acted violently in suppressing the protests of African-Americans {{during the civil rights}} movement. The Montgomery Police Commissioner, L. B. Sullivan, sued the Times for libel, stating that the advertisement damaged his reputation. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the $500,000 judgment against the Times. Justice Brennan suggested that public officials may sue for libel only if the publisher published the statements in question with [...] "actual malice"â€”"knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not." [...] In sum, the court held that [...] "the First Amendment protects the publication of all statements, even false ones, about the conduct of public officials except when statements are made with <b>actual</b> <b>malice</b> (with knowledge that they are false or in reckless disregard of their truth or falsity)." ...|$|E
500|$|While <b>actual</b> <b>malice</b> {{standard}} {{applies to}} public officials and public figures, in Philadelphia Newspapers v. Hepps (1988), the Court found that, {{with regard to}} private individuals, the First Amendment does [...] "not necessarily force any change {{in at least some}} features of the common-law landscape." [...] In Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc. (1985) the Court ruled that [...] "actual malice" [...] need not be shown in cases involving private individuals, holding that [...] "n light of the reduced constitutional value of speech involving no matters of public concern [...] [...] [...] the state interest adequately supports awards of presumed and punitive damagesâ€”even absent a showing of 'actual malice.'" [...] In Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974), the Court ruled that a private individual had to prove <b>actual</b> <b>malice</b> only to be awarded punitive damages, but not to seek actual damages. In Hustler Magazine v. Falwell (1988), the Court extended the [...] "actual malice" [...] standard to intentional infliction of emotional distress in a ruling which protected parody, in this case a fake advertisement in Hustler suggesting that evangelist Jerry Falwell's first sexual experience had been with his mother in an outhouse. Since Falwell was a public figure, the Court ruled that [...] "importance of the free flow of ideas and opinions on matters of public interest and concern" [...] was the paramount concern, and reversed the judgement Falwell had won against Hustler for emotional distress.|$|E
500|$|However, the Singapore Court of Appeal {{dismissed}} {{the applicability of}} both cases {{on the ground that}} the terms of Article 14 of the Constitution differ materially from Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which was relied upon by the court in Lingens; as well as the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which were relied upon by the court in New York Times. The public figure doctrine was thus expressly rejected by the Court. Thean J. said: [...] "Such criticisms or attacks must, in our opinion, respect the bounds set by the law of defamation, and we do not accept that the publication of false and defamatory allegations, {{even in the absence of}} <b>actual</b> <b>malice</b> on the part of the publisher, should be allowed to pass with impunity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finding that Hutchinson was {{a public}} figure, the court {{moved on to the}} {{question}} of whether Proxmire had acted with <b>actual</b> <b>malice.</b> Finding that there was no [...] "genuine issue of material fact" [...] the court granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of Proxmire.|$|E
2500|$|However {{the plaintiffs}} filed a [...] "motion for {{judgement}} notwithstanding the verdict, {{or in the}} alternative {{for a new trial}} [...] " [...] which Judge Decker allowed on the grounds that closer reading of the law persuaded him that Times applied insofar as it brought [...] "matters of public interest" [...] into the scope or requiring [...] "actual malice" [...] (knowledge of untruth or reckless disregard for the truth). [...] Decker opined (in a memorandum opinion) that Gertz had failed to show <b>actual</b> <b>malice.</b> [...] (Gertz remarks in his book, that since he had been specifically instructed that {{there was no need to}} show <b>actual</b> <b>malice,</b> he expected, at this point in the opinion, a new trial to be ordered.) [...] Decker granted the motion for judgement notwithstanding the verdict, saying that the law compelled it.|$|E
2500|$|O'Connor {{rejected}} the narrower protection Scalia advocated in his concurrence. [...] "Speech can be chilled and punished by administrative action {{as much as}} by judicial processes; in no case have we asserted or even implied the contrary." [...] To the plurality, however, it did not follow that all possible procedural review was constitutionally necessary. The Court had in some past defamation cases declined to apply the <b>actual</b> <b>malice</b> standard, even though doing so would strengthen free-speech protections, she noted.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2017, Ayyadurai, again {{represented}} by Harder, filed a $15 million libel lawsuit on similar grounds against Techdirt founder Mike Masnick {{and two other}} parties {{for a series of}} articles published beginning in September 2014. In February, Masnick, {{represented by}} the firm Prince Lobel, filed two motions to dismiss. [...] One motion argued that the articles were constitutionally protected opinion and written about a public figure without <b>actual</b> <b>malice.</b> The second motion asked for dismissal under California's anti-SLAPP law that compensates defendants for some legal expenses.|$|E
2500|$|On February 19, 1999, Manson counter-sued Marks for libel, slander and defamation. The singer {{was seeking}} [...] in reparation, {{claiming}} that Marks' statements were false and [...] "were made â€¦ with <b>actual</b> <b>malice,</b> hatred and personal ill will." [...] According to the counter-suit, Marks' allegations have [...] "greatly damaged and injured [...] reputation and {{standing in the}} music profession, in the music and entertainment industries, in his community and in the general public, and [...] {{has been subjected to}} great shame, humiliation and indignity." [...] Marks later dropped the lawsuit. As for the Poughkeepsie incident, Manson apologized and offered to make financial restitution.|$|E
2500|$|Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323 (1974), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States {{established}} the standard of First Amendment protection against defamation claims brought by private individuals. [...] The Court held that, so long as they do not impose liability without fault, states are free to establish their own standards of liability for defamatory statements made about private individuals. [...] However, the Court also ruled that if the state standard is lower than <b>actual</b> <b>malice,</b> the standard applying to public figures, then only actual damages may be awarded.|$|E
2500|$|Gertz {{filed suit}} in federal court against Robert Welch, Inc. (the John Birch Society's legal name), {{claiming}} its article had defamed and injured {{his reputation as a}} lawyer. [...] The John Birch Society moved for summary judgment, arguing that Gertz was a public figure under the recently enunciated Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts standard, which applied the New York Times Co. v. Sullivan standard to anyone who was sufficiently public, not just government officials. Thus, it was argued, their statements about him were specially privileged and the plaintiff would have to demonstrate <b>actual</b> <b>malice.</b> However, the magazine's editor admitted in an affidavit filed with the motion that he had made no independent effort to verify the claims in the article and had simply relied on the author's reputation and previous work.|$|E
2500|$|One of his sons, Yasser Abbas, (but not brother Tarek {{or father}} Mahmoud) filed a $10million libel lawsuit in the United States District Court, District of Columbia, in September 2012 against Foreign Policy Group LLC and Schanzer alleging [...] "false and {{defamatory}} statements. It seems every statement will be challenged, in a jury trial, {{if the court}} accepts jurisdiction." [...] Abbas also accused Schanzer of not contacting him for comment and of relying on untrustworthy sources of information. Abbas accused Schanzer of acting with malice and pursuing an agenda against the brothers, even though he also contended that he's a private citizen and not a public figure, so we wouldn't need to prove <b>actual</b> <b>malice</b> to win. In reply, the magazine has argued that Abbas's suit is aimed at intimidating his critics and stopping debate. [...] "In the final analysis, the commentary falls well within the protections of both the First Amendment and the common law," [...] lawyers for the magazine assert.|$|E
2500|$|On September 4, 2014, {{attorneys}} for Taya Kyle, as executor of the Estate of Chris Kyle, {{filed a motion}} for judgment {{as a matter of}} law or a new trial with the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. On September 26, 2014, {{attorneys for}} Ventura filed their reply to motions from Kyle's estate, that Ventura had proven Kyle's story was [...] "materially false", that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find <b>actual</b> <b>malice</b> and that there should not be a new trial. Attorneys for Taya Kyle on October 3, 2014 filed a reply to Ventura's response to the motions. This motion had to be ruled on before an appeal to the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals can be filed. On November 25, 2014, in a 24-page order, Judge Kyle denied all of the motions from the Estate of Chris Kyle, writing that [...] "t bottom, the Court concludes Defendant received a fair trial and that the juryâ€™s verdicts were supported by substantial evidence. Defendant is obviously disappointed in those verdicts, but her disappointment does not lay a foundation for a new trial or for judgment {{as a matter of law}}. Having found all of Defendantâ€™s arguments wanting, and based on all the files, records, and proceedings herein, IT IS ORDERED that Defendantâ€™s Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or New Trial (Doc. No. 404) is DENIED." [...] On December 23, 2014, attorneys for Taya Kyle, as executor of Chris Kyle's estate, filed notice of intent to appeal the district court's opinion to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. [...] On October 20, 2015, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments. On June 13, 2016, the appeals court vacated and reversed the unjust-enrichment judgment, and vacated and remanded the defamation judgment for a new trial.|$|E

50|$|Harte-Hanks Communications Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657(1989), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States {{supplied}} an additional journalistic behavior that constitutes <b>actual</b> <b>malice</b> as first discussed in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964). In the case, the Court held that departure from responsible reporting and unreasonable reporting conduct alone were not sufficient to award a public figure damages in a libel case. However, the Court also ruled that if reporters wrote with reckless disregard for the truth, which included ignoring obvious sources for their report, plaintiffs could be awarded compensatory damages on the grounds of <b>actual</b> <b>malice.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Cox also {{asserted}} {{that even if}} the plaintiffs weren't public figures, in order for the plaintiffs to claim damages, they must prove <b>actual</b> <b>malice</b> because she is a [...] "media" [...] outlet. Here, the court again held that Cox did not qualify as [...] "media". In its reasoning, the court cited her lack of a journalism degree, lack of affiliation with traditional media outlets, lack of adherence to journalistic standards such as fact-checking and fair coverage, and the absence of Cox writing any original material rather than assembling the works of others. As such, the plaintiffs could seek damages without any further evidence of <b>actual</b> <b>malice.</b>|$|E
50|$|After consideration, the Supreme Court of Canada {{determined}} {{that it would not}} follow the <b>actual</b> <b>malice</b> standard set forth in the famous United States Supreme Court case of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964).|$|E
50|$|In November 2016, {{a federal}} court jury found Erdely was liable for {{defamation}} with <b>actual</b> <b>malice</b> in a lawsuit brought by University of Virginia administrator Nicole Eramo, and Erdely was found personally responsible for $2 million in damages.|$|E

5000|$|Justice Stevens {{began his}} opinion by {{referencing}} New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964) and Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts (1967), which state that public figures, such as Connaughton, must definitively prove <b>actual</b> <b>malice</b> {{to be awarded}} damages in libel suits.|$|E
5000|$|Cox {{asserted}} {{that because the}} plaintiffs are public figures and because she blogged about {{a matter of public}} concern, First Amendment protections are triggered. As a result, to prove defamation, <b>actual</b> <b>malice</b> on Cox's part must be shown. [...] "Actual malice" [...] would require that Cox had knowledge of the truth and knowingly disregarded the facts, instead of simply making a false assertion of facts on her blog. Ultimately, the court held that neither Obsidian or Padrick were public figures, stating that the Summit 1031 bankruptcy Cox blogged on was neither controversial nor newsworthy, and Cox was the only person trying to publicize the issue. As a result, <b>actual</b> <b>malice</b> {{did not need to be}} proven by the plaintiffs.|$|E
50|$|He {{finished}} his opinion by stating that, {{because of the}} inconsistencies with the JournalNews' reporting, and because they deliberately ignored sources that would have either affirmed or denied Stephens' allegations, the JournalNews was guilty of reckless disregard for the truth and, by extension, <b>actual</b> <b>malice.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Finding that Hutchinson was {{a public}} figure, the court {{moved on to the}} {{question}} of whether Proxmire had acted with <b>actual</b> <b>malice.</b> Finding that there was no [...] "genuine issue of material fact" [...] the court granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of Proxmire.|$|E
