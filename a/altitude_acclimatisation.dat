40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to examine the}} {{physiological}} and haematological responses to altitude training and hypoxic exposures. Furthermore to investigate if additional hypoxic exposure around a “live high-train high” altitude training camp could maximise adaptations. Study one provided a detailed insight into the current practices and perceptions of elite British endurance athletes and coaches to altitude training. A survey found that the athletes and support staff’s concerns included maintaining training load at <b>altitude,</b> reducing the <b>acclimatisation</b> period, maximising haematological adaptations and when to compete on return to sea level. These challenges were prioritised and investigated further in the thesis. Confidence in the optimised carbon monoxide (CO) rebreathing method (oCOR-method) is paramount when assessing haematological adaptations.

40|$|Objectives To {{examine the}} time course of wellness, fatigue and {{performance}} during an altitude training camp (La Paz, 3600  m) in {{two groups of}} either sea-level (Australian) or altitude (Bolivian) native young soccer players. Methods Wellness and fatigue were assessed using questionnaires and resting heart rate (HR) and HR variability. Physical performance was assessed using HR responses to a submaximal run, a Yo-Yo Intermittent recovery test level 1 (Yo-YoIR 1) and a 20  m sprint. Most measures were performed daily, with the exception of Yo-YoIR 1 and 20  m sprints, which were performed near sea level and on days 3 and 10 at altitude. Results Compared with near sea level, Australians had moderate-to-large impairments in wellness and Yo-YoIR 1 relative to the Bolivians on arrival at <b>altitude.</b> The <b>acclimatisation</b> of most measures to altitude was substantially slower in Australians than Bolivians, with only Bolivians reaching near sea-level baseline high-intensity running {{by the end of the}} camp. Both teams had moderately impaired 20  m sprinting at the end of the camp. Exercise HR had large associations (r> 0. 5 – 0. 7) with changes in Yo-YoIR 1 in both groups. Conclusions Despite partial physiological and perceptual acclimatisation, 2  weeks is insufficient for restoration of physical performance in young sea-level native soccer players. Because of the possible decrement in 20  m sprint time, a greater emphasis on speed training may be required during and after altitude training. The specific time course of restoration for each variable suggests that they measure different aspects of acclimatisation to 3600  m; they should therefore be used in combination to assess adaptation to altitude...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThere is an {{increasing}} body of evidence suggesting that altered vascular permeability {{may be an important}} component of the pathogenesis of acute mountain sickness (AMS). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent permeability factor subject to hypoxic regulation but its role in the pathogenesis of AMS is yet to be defined. We examined the relationship between plasma VEGF and AMS on ascent to high <b>altitude</b> and subsequent <b>acclimatisation.</b> Thirty-eight healthy lowlanders (median age 21, range 18 – 31) flew to La Paz, Bolivia (3650 m) on the Apex 2 research expedition. After 4 – 5 days acclimatisation, they ascended by vehicle over 90 min to the Chacaltaya laboratory (5200 m). We measured plasma VEGF in venous blood at sea level and at 6 h and 3 and 7 days at 5200 m. AMS was scored using the Lake Louise consensus system. Using serial measurement of plasma VEGF at 5200 m, following partial acclimatisation at 3650 m, we demonstrated a highly significant change in VEGF levels (P< 0. 0005) with a rise in VEGF in approximately 80 % of subjects by day 7 at 5200 m. We found no evidence of an association between AMS and change in VEGF levels on ascent to either 3650 or 5200 m. We provide novel data of change in plasma VEGF levels during <b>acclimatisation</b> to high <b>altitude,</b> but our results do not support the hypothesis that circulating unbound VEGF is {{an important component of the}} pathogenesis of AMS...|$|R

40|$|A {{peculiar}} form of illness, {{called in}} English “mountain sickness,” {{has been known}} for centuries to affect persons who have to pass over or ascend high mountains. The usual symptoms of this illness are nausea, vomiting and headache, with much loss of muscular power, and depression. It has also been known for long that only newcomers are attacked, since inhabitants of high altitudes, or persons visiting them frequently, are “acclimatised. ” Until the investigations of Paul Bert, summarised in his well-known book La pression barombtrique, 1878, the essential cause of mountain sickness was unknown; and even in much more recent times the cause continued to be wholly misunderstood, even by prominent physiologists such as Moss 0 and Kronecker. Paul Bert’s experiments, made partly on animals, and partly on himself in a steel chamber, showed con-clusively that whatever other conditions may contribute to the produc-tion of mountain sickness, the essential cause is diminution in the partial pressure or concentration of oxygen in the air inspired. At high altitudes this partial pressure is reduced along with the reduction in total atmospheric pressure, though the percentage composition of the air is exactly the same at high altitudes as at sea-level. If the lowering of the oxygen pressure is prevented by adding pure oxygen to the air the lowering of barometric pressure has no effect. <b>Acclimatisation</b> to high <b>altitudes</b> is thus <b>acclimatisation</b> to an ab-normally low partial pressure of oxygen in the air breathed, and the present paper deals with {{the manner in which the}} acclimatisation is brought about. The subject is still one of pretty acute controversy among physiologists, though there is now general agreement that Paul Bert’s experiments were conclusive as to the real cause of moun-tain sickness. There is also now general agreement that the low oxygen pressur...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The optimal {{strategy}} for soccer teams playing at altitude is not known, that is, ‘fly-in, fly-out’ versus short-term acclimatisation. Here, we document changes in blood gas and vascular volumes of sea-level (Australian, n= 20) and altitude (Bolivian, n= 19) native soccer players at 3600 m. Methods: Haemoglobin-oxygen saturation (Hb-sO 2), arterial oxygen content (CaO 2), haemoglobin mass (Hbmass), blood volume (BV) and blood gas concentrations were measured before descent (Bolivians only), together with aerobic fitness (via Yo-YoIR 1), near sea-level, after ascent and during 13 days at 3600 m. Results: At baseline, haemoglobin concentration [Hb] and Hbmass were higher in Bolivians (mean±SD; 18. 2 ± 1. 0 g/dL, 12. 8 ± 0. 8 g/kg) than Australians (15. 0 ± 0. 9 g/dL, 11. 6 ± 0. 7 g/kg; both p≤ 0. 001). Near sea-level, [Hb] of Bolivians decreased to 16. 6 ± 0. 9 g/dL, but normalised upon return to 3600 m; Hbmass was constant regardless of altitude. In Australians, [Hb] increased after 12 days at 3600 m to 17. 3 ± 1. 0 g/dL; Hbmass increased by 3. 0 ± 2. 7 % (p≤ 0. 01). BV decreased in both teams at altitude by ∼ 400 mL. Arterial partial pressure for oxygen (PaO 2), Hb-sO 2 and CaO 2 of both teams decreased within 2 h of arrival at 3600 m (p≤ 0. 001) but {{increased over the}} following days, with CaO 2 overcompensated in Australians (+ 1. 7 ± 1. 2 mL/ 100 mL; p≤ 0. 001). Yo-YoIR 1 was lower on the 3 rd versus 10 th day at altitude and {{was significantly related to}} CaO 2. Conclusions: The marked drop in PaO 2 and CaO 2 observed after ascent does not support the ‘fly-in, fly-out’ approach for soccer teams to play immediately after arrival at <b>altitude.</b> Although short-term <b>acclimatisation</b> was sufficient for Australians to stabilise their CaO 2 (mostly due to loss of plasma volume), 12 days appears insufficient to reach chronic levels of adaption...|$|R

40|$|Rationale The {{relationship}} between cigarette smoking and acute mountain sickness (AMS) is not clear. Objective To assess AMS risk and <b>altitude</b> <b>acclimatisation</b> {{in relation to}} smoking. Methods 200 healthy non-smokers and 182 cigarette smokers were recruited from Han lowland workers. These were men without prior altitude exposure, matched for age, health status and occupation, who were transported to an altitude of 4525 masl. Measurements AMS, smoking habits, arterial saturation (SpO 2), haemoglobin (Hb), lung function and mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm) were assessed upon arrival and after 3 and 6 months. Main results Compared with non-smokers, smokers had a lower incidence of AMS and lower AMS scores than non-smokers upon arrival; higher Hb and PAPm associated with lower SpO 2 at 3 and 6 months at altitude; and lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s and maximal voluntary ventilation at 3 and 6 months.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} monitor <b>altitude</b> <b>acclimatisation</b> in an elite cohort of distance runners and follow the subsequent recovery from infectious mononucleosis which developed {{in one of these}} athletes. METHODS: Twenty six national standard distance runners performed treadmill tests 24 days before they travelled to an altitude camp (1500 to 2000 m). One of these athletes was diagnosed as suffering from infectious mononucleosis 14 days after return to sea level. A physician prescribed an individualised training programme which was designed to maximise recovery from the condition, which was monitored on days 16 and 147 after altitude training. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the athlete {{was in a state of}} over-reaching during the altitude sojourn. After return to sea level, the early stages of infectious mononucleosis resulted in a marked impairment in physiological response to endurance exercise, which improved over time. Longitudinal physiological monitoring in conjunction with a carefully prescribed training programme made recovery from this condition possible...|$|E
40|$|Acclimatisation to {{environmental}} hypoxia initiates {{a series of}} metabolic and musculocardio-respiratory adaptations that influence oxygen transport and utilisation, or better still, being born and raised at altitude, is necessary to achieve optimal physical performance at altitude, scientific {{evidence to support the}} potentiating effects after return to sea level is at present equivocal. Despite this, elite athletes continue to spend considerable time and resources training at altitude, misled by subjective coaching opinion and the inconclusive findings {{of a large number of}} uncontrolled studies. Scientific investigation has focused on the optimisation of the theoretically beneficial aspects of <b>altitude</b> <b>acclimatisation,</b> which include increases in blood haemoglobin concentration, elevated buffering capacity, and improvements in the structural and biochemical properties of skeletal muscle. However, not all aspects of <b>altitude</b> <b>acclimatisation</b> are beneficial; cardiac output and blood flow to skeletal muscles decrease, and preliminary evidence has shown that hypoxia in itself is responsible for a depression of immune function and increased tissue damage mediated by oxidative stress. Future research needs to focus on these less beneficial aspects of altitude training, the implications of which pose a threat to both the fitness and the health of the elite competitor. Paul Bert was the first investigator to show that acclimatisation to a chronically reduced inspiratory partial pressure of oxygen (P 1 O 2) invoked a series of central and peripheral adaptations that served to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation in healthy skeletal muscle, physiological adaptations that have been subsequently implicated in the improvement in exercise performance during <b>altitude</b> <b>acclimatisation.</b> However, it was not until half a century later that scientists suggested that the additive stimulus of environmental hypoxia could potentially compound the normal physiological adaptations to endurance training and accelerate performance improvements after return to sea level. This has stimulated an exponential increase in scientific research, and, since 1984, 22 major reviews have summarised the physiological implications of altitude training for both aerobic and anaerobic performance at altitude and after return to sea level. Of these reviews, only eight have specifically focused on physical performance changes after return to sea level, the most comprehensive of which was recently written by Wolski et al. Few reviews have considered the potentially less favourable physiological responses to moderate altitude exposure, which include decreases in absolute training intensity, decreased plasma volume, depression of haemopoiesis and increased haemolysis, increases in sympathetically mediated glycogen depletion at altitude, and increased respiratory muscle work after return to sea level. In addition, there is a risk of developing more serious medical complications at altitude, which include acute mountain sickness, pulmonary oedema, cardiac arrhythmias, and cerebral hypoxia. The possible implications of changes in immune function at altitude have also been largely ignored, despite accumulating evidence of hypoxia mediated immunosuppression. In general, altitude training has been shown to improve performance at altitude, whereas no unequivocal evidence exists to support the claim that performance at sea level is improved. Table 1 summarises the theoretical advantages and disadvantages of altitude training for sea level performance. This review summarises the physiological rationale for altitude training as a means of enhancing endurance performance after return to sea level. Factors that have been shown to affect the acclimatisation process and the subsequent implications for exercise performance at sea level will also be discussed.

40|$|Chronic hypoxia is {{associated}} with elevated sympathetic activity and hypertension in patients with chronic pulmonary obstructive disease. However, the effect of chronic hypoxia on systemic and regional sympathetic activity in healthy humans remains unknown. To determine if chronic hypoxia in healthy humans {{is associated}} with hyperactivity of the sympathetic system, we measured intra-arterial blood pressure, arterial blood gases, systemic and skeletal muscle noradrenaline (norepinephrine) spillover and vascular conductances in nine Danish lowlanders at sea level and after 9 weeks of exposure at 5260 m. Mean blood pressure was 28 % higher at altitude (P < 0. 01) due to increases in both systolic (18 % higher, P < 0. 05) and diastolic (41 % higher, P < 0. 001) blood pressures. Cardiac output and leg blood flow were not altered by chronic hypoxia, but systemic vascular conductance was reduced by 30 % (P < 0. 05). Plasma arterial noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline concentrations were 3. 7 - and 2. 4 -fold higher at altitude, respectively (P < 0. 05). The elevation of plasma arterial NA concentration {{was caused by a}} 3. 8 -fold higher whole-body NA release (P < 0. 001) since whole-body noradrenaline clearance was similar in both conditions. Leg NA spillover was increased similarly (× 3. 2, P < 0. 05). These changes occurred despite the fact that systemic O 2 delivery was greater after <b>altitude</b> <b>acclimatisation</b> than at sea level, due to 37 % higher blood haemoglobin concentration. In summary, this study shows that chronic hypoxia causes marked activation of the sympathetic nervous system in healthy humans and increased systemic arterial pressure, despite normalisation of the arterial O 2 content with acclimatisation...|$|E
40|$|EN] The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} investigation was to determine the influence of blood haemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) on maximal exercise capacity and maximal O(2) consumption (V(O(2),max)) in healthy subjects acclimatised to high altitude. Secondarily, we examined the effects of [Hb] on the regulation of cardiac output (CO), blood pressure and muscular blood flow (LBF) during exercise. Eight Danish lowlanders (three females and five males; 24 +/- 0. 6 years, mean +/- S. E. M.) performed submaximal and maximal exercise on a cycle ergometer after 9 weeks at an altitude of 5260 m (Mt Chacaltaya, Bolivia). This was done first with the high [Hb] resulting from acclimatisation and again 2 - 4 days later, 1 h after isovolaemic haemodilution with Dextran 70 to near sea level [Hb]. After measurements at maximal exercise while breathing air at each [Hb], subjects were switched to hyperoxia (55 % O(2) in N(2)) and the measurements were repeated, increasing the work rate as tolerated. Hyperoxia increased maximal power output and leg V(O(2),max), showing that breathing ambient air at 5260 m, V(O(2),max) is limited by the availability of O(2) rather than by muscular oxidative capacity. Altitude increased [Hb] by 36 % from 136 +/- 5 to 185 +/- 5 g l(- 1) (P < 0. 001), while haemodilution (replacing 1 l of blood with 1 l of 6 % Dextran) lowered [Hb] by 24 % to 142 +/- 6 g l(- 1) (P < 0. 001). Haemodilution had no effect on maximal pulmonary or leg V(O(2),max), or power output. Despite higher LBF, leg O(2) delivery was reduced and maximal V(O(2)) was thus maintained by higher O(2) extraction. While CO increased linearly with work rate irrespective of [Hb] or inspired oxygen fraction (F(I,O(2))), both LBF and leg vascular conductance were systematically higher when [Hb] was low. Close and significant relationships were seen between LBF (and CO) and both plasma noradrenaline and K(+) concentrations, independently of [Hb] and F(I,O(2)). In summary, under conditions where O(2) supply limits maximal exercise, the increase in [Hb] with <b>altitude</b> <b>acclimatisation</b> does not improve maximal exercise capacity or V(O(2),max), and does not alter peak CO. However, LBF and vascular conductance are higher at altitude when [Hb] is lowered to sea level values, with both relating closely to catecholamine and potassium concentrations. This suggests that the lack of effect of [Hb] on V(O(2),max) may involve reciprocal changes in LBF via local metabolic control of the muscle vasculature...|$|E
