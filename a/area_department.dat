40|$|Abstract. The {{effective}} segmentation algorithm {{of image}} lesion <b>areas</b> in <b>Department</b> of Internal Medicine {{is an important}} problem {{in the field of}} medical imaging. The current segmentation techniques of image lesion <b>areas</b> in <b>Department</b> of Internal Medicine are using the difference characters of edge pixels, due to visceral adhesions, the segmentation threshold is difficult to be accurately defined, and the precision is low. Therefore, this paper proposed a segmentation method of image lesion <b>areas</b> in <b>Department</b> of Internal Medicine based on improved cuckoo search algorithm to optimize maximum entropy. Firstly, by the maximum entropy method to find segmentation objective function of image lesion <b>areas</b> in <b>Department</b> of internal medicine, then the improved cuckoo search algorithm is adopted to optimize the objective function, find the best segmentation position of image lesion <b>area</b> in <b>Department</b> of internal medicine, so as to achieve image lesion area segmentation, finally multiple images of internal medicine are utilized to conduct simulation experiment, in order to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results show that, this method not only solves the defects existing in the traditional segmentation algorithm, while improving the precision of image lesion area of internal medicine, has better robustness, and better practical value...|$|R
