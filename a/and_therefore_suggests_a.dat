[...] In contrast, Mueller and Leslie Kurke both argue that the addressee is probably meant to be female, based on Sappho's use of the word [...] to describe their speech: meaning [...] "chattering" [...] or [...] "babbling", the word has negative connotations which would make Sappho unlikely to use it to address a man.

On the other hand, a disproportional slowing down of movement speed under spatial-accuracy demands, indicating a more central problem in motor programming. To assess their motor performance problems, 15 girls with TS (age 9. 1 - 13. 0 years) and 14 female controls (age 9. 1 - 13. 0 years) were tested using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC). In additionally, an experimental procedure using a variant of Fitts' graphic aiming task was used to try and disentangle the role of spatial-accuracy demands in different motor task conditions. The results of the MABC reestablish that overall motor performance in girls with TS is poor. The data from the Fitts' task reveal that TS girls move with the same accuracy as their normal peers but show a significantly lower speed independent of task difficulty.

Small avian species wintering in these environments show acclimatization where basal metabolic rate (BMR) and maximal thermogenic capacity (MSUM) are typically elevated. However, little is known on intra-seasonal variation in metabolic performance and on how population trends truly reflect individual flexibility. Here we report intra-seasonal variation in metabolic parameters measured at the population and individual levels in black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus). Results confirmed that population patterns indeed reflect flexibility at the individual level. They showed the expected increase in BMR (6 %) and MSUM (34 %) in winter relative to summer but also, and most importantly, that these parameters changed differently through time. BMR began its seasonal increase in November, while MSUM had already achieved more than 20 % of its inter-seasonal increase by October, and declined to its starting level by March, while MSUM remained high. Although both parameters co-vary on a yearly scale, this mismatch in the timing of variation in winter BMR and MSUM likely reflects different constraints acting on different physiological components <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> lack of functional link between these parameters...|$|E

To study the role of nucleocapsid protein (NP) in MV-induced immunosuppression, we produced recombinant MV NP. Purified recombinant NP exhibited biochemical, antigenic, and tridimensional structure similar to viral NP. By flow cytometry, we showed that viral or recombinant NP bound to human and murine B lymphocytes, but not to T lymphocytes. This binding was specific, independent of MHC class II expression, and dependent of the B lymphocyte activation state. The murine IIA 1. 6 B cell line, deficient in the Fc receptor for IgG (Fc�RII) expression, did not bind NP efficiently. Transfected IIA 1. 6 cells expressing either murine Fc�RIIb 1 or b 2, or human Fc�RIIa, b 1 *, or b 2 isoforms efficiently bound NP. Furthermore, this binding was inhibited up to 90 % by monoclonal antibodies 2. 4 G 2 or KB 61 specific for murine and human Fc�RII, respectively. Finally, the in vitro Ig synthesis of CD 40 - or Ig-activated human B lymphocytes in the presence of interleukin (IL) - 2 and IL- 10 was reduced by 50 % in the presence of recombinant NP.

The preference for the 2 T model applies {{whether or not the}} data are deprojected. The cooler component has a temperature (∼ 0. 9 keV) similar to the kinetic temperature of the stars while the hotter component has a temperature (∼ 1. 5 keV) characteristic of the virial temperature of a ∼ 10 13 M ⊙ halo. The two-phase model (and other multitemperature models) removes the “Fe Bias ” within r � 20 kpc and gives ZFe/Z ⊙ ≈ 1. 5 − 2.

The Si abundance is super-solar (1. 2 - 1. 7 solar) within the central regions while ZSi/ZFe ≈ 0. 8 over the entire region studied.

The underpinning theory for this phenomenon is not yet completely understood, and is still the subject of ongoing study. Here we conduct a theoretical investigation into CM efficiency in elongated semiconductor nanostructures with square cross section made of different materials (GaAs, GaSb, InAs, InP, InSb, CdSe, Ge, Si and PbSe), using a single-band effective mass model. Following Luo, Franceschetti and Zunger we adopt the CM figure of merit (the ratio between biexciton and single-exciton density of states) as a measure of CM efficiency and investigate its dependence on the aspect ratio for both (a) constant cross section (i. e. varying the volume) and (b) constant volume (i. e., varying the cross section), by decoupling electronic structure effects from surface-related effects, increased absorption and Coulomb coupling effects. The results show that in both (a) and (b) cases elongation causes an increase in both single- and bi-exciton density of states, with the latter, however, growing much faster with increasing energy. This leads to the availability of more bi-exciton states than single-exciton states for photon energies just above the bi-exciton ground state <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> higher probability of CM at these energies for elongated structures. Our results therefore show that the origin of the observed decrease of the CM threshold in elongated structures can be attributed purely to electronic structure effects, paving the way to the implementation of CM-efficiency-boosting strategies in nanostructures based on the lowering of the CM onset...|$|E

Our data indicate that the MDE might have in fact occurred in Europe within a time interval of about 67 kyr around the CIE onset...|$|E
40|$|International river basins {{are mostly}} {{characterized}} by upstream-downstream externalities that involve asymmetric incentives to cooperate <b>and,</b> <b>therefore,</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> high conflict potential between riparian states. However, {{with more than}} 400 river basin treaties, cooperation along international rivers by far outweighs water-related conflicts. The abundance of international water cooperation despite the odds is puzzling and has so far received little systematic attention. Against this background, I develop a research framework that draws on international regime theory and combines power, interest, knowledge and contextbased approaches to water regime formation. In a second step, I probe the plausibility of my framework in two case studies on international water cooperation in the Rhine and Elbe river basins. The empirical findings {{suggest that there is}} no "one-answer-fits-all" in trying to explain water regime formation. While power-based approaches are of limited explanatory value, a thorough understanding of cooperation along the two international rivers requires the combination of interest, knowledge and context-based arguments.

40|$|Published onlineJournal ArticleRecent {{clinical}} {{work has}} implicated network structure as critically {{important in the}} initiation of seizures in people with idiopathic generalized epilepsies. In line with this idea, functional networks derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG) at rest {{have been shown to}} be significantly different in people with generalized epilepsy compared to controls. In particular, the mean node degree of networks from the epilepsy cohort was found to be statistically significantly higher than those of controls. However, the mechanisms by which these network differences can support recurrent transitions into seizures remain unclear. In this study, we use a computational model of the transition into seizure dynamics to explore the dynamic consequences of these differences in functional networks. We demonstrate that networks with higher mean node degree are more prone to generating seizure dynamics in the model <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> mechanism by which increased mean node degree of brain networks can cause heightened ictogenicity.

40|$|Although many {{components}} and reaction steps necessary for bidirectional transport across the nuclear envelope (NE) have been characterized, the mechanism {{and control of}} cargo migration through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) remain poorly understood. Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy was used to track the movement of cargos before, during, and after their interactions with NPCs. At low importin β concentrations, {{about half of the}} signal-dependent cargos that interacted with an NPC were translocated across the NE, indicating a nuclear import efficiency of ∼ 50 %. At high importin β concentrations, the import efficiency increased to ∼ 80 % and the transit speed increased approximately sevenfold. The transit speed and import efficiency of a signal-independent cargo was also increased by high importin β concentrations. These results demonstrate that maximum nucleocytoplasmic transport velocities can be modulated by at least ∼ 10 -fold by the importin β concentration <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> potential mechanism for regulating the speed of cargo traffic across the NE...|$|R
