40|$|Combustion {{instability}} {{has many}} detrimental effects on flight-propulsion dynamics and structural integrity of gas turbine engines and its early detection {{is one of}} the important tasks in engine health monitoring and prognostics. Combustion in-stability is characterized by self-sustained, large-amplitude pressure oscillations and periodic shedding of coherent vor-tex structures at varied spatial scales. It is caused when lo-calized hydrodynamic perturbations in fluid flow fluctuations are augmented by <b>heat</b> <b>release,</b> <b>coupled</b> with acoustics of the combustion chamber.

40|$|A growing {{recognition}} {{exists in the}} United States that injector dynamics play {{a pivotal role in}} the combustion instabilities of some Liquid Rocket Engines (LREs). Russian researchers believe injector dynamics can lead to unsteady mass flow from the injector to the combustion chamber resulting in unsteady <b>heat</b> <b>release.</b> Unsteady <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> <b>coupled</b> with the chamber modes, could cause combustion instability and the destruction of the rocket. The research described herein focused on the use of computational fluid dynamics to describe the frequency and amplitude of unsteady mass flow rate from a gas-centered coaxial swirl injector with varying geometries and fluid properties. An incompressible model, therefore, was utilized to investigate the effects of density ratio, liquid swirl velocity, liquid film thickness, collar thickness, and recess length. Present findings showed that the frequency at which the liquid film oscillates increases as the density ratio and collar thickness increase, decreases as the film thickness and liquid swirl velocity increases, and is unaffected by the recess length. Thus, the frequency seems dependent on the behavior of the vortex shedding/reattachment from the collar and the dynamic pressure imbalance on the liquid surface. The vortex behavior has been included as an important parameter for determining the behavior of the film given that the collar thickness affects the frequency. ^ Since these studies lead to the belief that the vortex dynamics aft of the collar are important, a more fundamental study concerning the vortex dynamics behind a splitter plate/post was undertaken. For this study a compressible model was utilized to investigate the effects of momentum ratio, axisymmetry, the presence of a wall near the splitter, and swirl. Shedding frequency was found to increase as the momentum ratio varies from unity. Furthermore, axisymmetry reduced the shedding frequency over all momentum ratios. The presence of a wall near the splitter, in contrast, increased the shedding frequency when the higher momentum stream was adjacent to the wall. Finally, swirl caused complex interactions aft of the splitter rendering distinct trends in shedding frequency difficult to discern for high amounts of swirl. ...|$|R

40|$|Combustion instabilities remain one of {{the most}} {{challenging}} problems encountered in developing propulsion and power systems. Large amplitude pressure oscillations, driven by unsteady <b>heat</b> <b>release,</b> can produce numerous detrimental effects. Most previous active control studies utilized gaseous fuels to suppress combustion instabilities. However, using liquid fuel to suppress combustion instabilities is more realistic for propulsion applications. Active instability suppression in vortex-driven combustors using a direct liquid fuel injection strategy was theoretically established and experimentally demonstrated in this dissertation work. Droplet size measurements revealed that with pulsed fuel injection management, fuel droplet size could be modulated periodically. Consequently, desired <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> fluctuation could be created. If this oscillatory <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> is <b>coupled</b> with the natural pressure oscillation in an out of phase manner, combustion instabilities can be suppressed. To identify proper locations of supplying additional liquid fuel for the purpose of achieving control, the natural <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> pattern in a vortex-driven combustor was characterized in this study. It was found that at high Damköhler number oscillatory <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> pattern closely followed the evolving vortex front. However, when Damköhler number became close to unity, <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> fluctuation wave no longer coincided with the coherent structures. A <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> deficit area was found near the dump plane when combustor was operated in lean premixed conditions. Active combustion instability suppression experiments were performed in a dump combustor using a controlled liquid fuel injection strategy. High-speed Schlieren results illustrated that vortex shedding {{plays an important role in}} maintaining self-sustained combustion instabilities. Complete combustion instability control requires total suppression of these large-scale coherent structures. The sound pressure level at the excited dominant frequency was reduced by more than 20 dB with controlled liquid fuel injection method. Scaling issues were also investigated in this dump combustor to test the effectiveness of using pulsed liquid fuel injection strategies to suppress instabilities at higher power output conditions. With the liquid fuel injection control method, it was possible to suppress strong instabilities with initial amplitude of 5 psi down to the background noise level. The stable combustor operating range was also expanded from equivalence ratio of 0. 75 to beyond 0. 9...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{regulations}} on NO, emissions are promoting {{the use of}} lean premix (LPM) combustion for industrial gas turbines. LPM combustors avoid locally stoichiometric combustion by premixing fuel and the air upstream of the reaction region, thereby eliminating the high temperatures that produce thermal NO [...] Unfortunately, this style of combustor is prone to combustion oscillation. Significant pressure fluctuations can occur when variations in <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> periodically <b>couple</b> pressure to acoustic modes in the combustion chamber. These oscillations must be controlled because resulting vibration can shorten the life of engine hardware. Laboratory and engine field testing have shown that instability regimes can vary with environmental conditions. These observations prompted this study {{of the effects of}} ambient conditions and fuel composition on combustion stability. Tests are conducted on a sub-scale combustor burning natural gas, propane, and some hydrogen/hydrocarbon mixtures. A premix, swirl-stabilized fuel nozzle typical of industrial gas turbines is used. Experimental and numerical results describe how stability regions may shift as inlet air temperature, humidity, and fuel composition are altered. Results appear to indicate that shifting instability instability regimes are primarily caused by changes in reaction rate...|$|R

The defect structure in the as-processed samples was examined by electron microscopy and X-ray line profile analysis.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} emission characteristics in relation to differences in fuel moisture content (FMC) and initial dry mass. For this purpose, branches and twigs with leaves of Cistus monspeliensis were burned in a Large Scale <b>Heat</b> <b>Release</b> apparatus <b>coupled</b> to a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer. A smoke analysis was conducted and the results highlighted the presence of CO 2, H 2 O, CO, CH 4, NO, NO 2, NH 3, SO 2, and non-methane organic compounds (NMOC). CO 2, NO, and NO 2 species are mainly released during flaming combustion, whereas CO, CH 4, NH 3, and NMOC are emitted during both flaming and smoldering combustion. The emission of these compounds during flaming combustion is due to a rich fuel to air mixture, leading to incomplete combustion. The fuel moisture content and initial dry mass influence the flame residence time, the duration of smoldering combustion, the combustion efficiency, and the emission factors. By increasing the initial dry mass, the emission factors of NO, NO 2, and CO 2 decrease, whereas those of CO and CH 4 increase. The increase of FMC induces an increase of the emission factors of CO, CH 4, NH 3, NMOC, and aerosols, and a decrease of those of CO 2, NO, and NO 2. Increasing fuel moisture content reduces fuel consumption, duration of smoldering, and peak <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate, but simultaneously increases the duration of propagation within the packed bed, and the flame residence time. Increasing the initial dry mass, causes all the previous combustion parameters to increase. These findings have implications for modeling biomass burning emissions and impacts...|$|R
