50|$|Downstream {{of the air}} handler, {{the supply}} <b>air</b> <b>trunk</b> duct will {{commonly}} fork, providing air to many individual air outlets such as diffusers, grilles, and registers. When the system is designed with a main duct branching into many subsidiary branch ducts, fittings called take-offs allow {{a small portion of}} the flow in the main duct to be diverted into each branch duct. Take-offs may be fitted into round or rectangular openings cut into the wall of the main duct. The take-off commonly has many small metal tabs that are then bent to attach the take-off to the main duct. Round versions are called spin-in fittings. Other take-off designs use a snap-in attachment method, sometimes coupled with an adhesive foam gasket for improved sealing. The outlet of the take-off then connects to the rectangular, oval, or round branch duct.|$|E
40|$|Abstact. The strong icing of {{underground}} excavation of the “Rasvumchorr ” mine is caused mainly by meteorological factors. The ice forming in the <b>air</b> <b>trunk</b> begins, when the moisture {{content in the}} atmospheric air decreases below the critical value. In that case {{the walls of the}} <b>air</b> <b>trunk</b> cools as expends very much heat for the water evaporation in the injected dry atmospheric air despite the fact of positive temperature (about + 3 - 5 °C). Meteorological criteria of the ice appearance are established. Preliminary theoretical study of a problem has shown unconditional prospects of temperature regulation of air depending on not only temperature but also absolute humidity of external air. At the same time the proposed method of the ice control is more economical than the present ones...|$|E

50|$|Skyships are {{equipped}} {{with a pair of}} ballonets, one forward and one aft comprising a maximum of 27% of the envelope's gross volume. Ballonets are air-filled compartments within an airship that compensate for the expansion and contraction of the helium, thereby maintaining envelope pressure. They can be filled, or partially filled, with air. Emptying of air is done through four valves under the envelope. The valves open automatically as the ship climbs; air is released, the ballonets collapse and the helium expands. During descent, air from the propeller ducts, and/or electric fans is used to inflate the ballonets, and keep the envelope from collapsing. The ballonets can be independently filled by using shut-off dampers in the <b>air</b> supply <b>trunking.</b> Through differential inflation a measure of pitch trim can be obtained.|$|R

Extremely powerful, Kyorestu-Oh uses Kishamoth's ability to shoot out a gust of cold <b>air</b> from his <b>trunk,</b> which is cold enough to cool magma. Its signature attacks are the Railway Chop (Denshamichi Choppu), Dinosaur Kick (Dainasō Kikku), Kyoretsu Dino Bite (Kyōretsu Daina Baito), and KishamoSteam (Kishamosuchīmu). Its finishing move is the Kyoretsu Express (Kyōretsu Ekusupuresu) where it uses the freezing mist to execute a burning-chop attack.|$|R
60|$|After {{standing}} {{for a while}} in the attitude that I have described, testing the <b>air</b> with its <b>trunk,</b> Jana, for I will call him so, lumbered down the mound and advanced straight to where the elephant that I had thought to be dead was kneeling. As a matter of fact it was not quite dead, for when Jana arrived it lifted its trunk and curled it round that of Jana as though in affectionate greeting, then let it fall to the ground again. Thereon Jana did what I had seen it do in my dream or vision at Ragnall, namely, attacked it, knocking it over on to its side, where it lay motionless; quite dead this time.|$|R
60|$|He stopped shooting, and watched. He {{noted the}} {{direction}} of the animal's flight, and, high up on the hillside in an opening among the trees, saw the trunk of a fallen pine. Continuing the moose's flight in his mind he saw that it must pass the trunk. He resolved on one more shot, and in the empty <b>air</b> above the <b>trunk</b> he aimed and steadied his wavering rifle. The animal sprang into his field of vision, with lifted fore-legs as it took the leap. He pulled the trigger. With the explosion the moose seemed to somersault in the air. It crashed down to earth in the snow beyond and flurried the snow into dust.|$|R

5000|$|Phish was {{the only}} band to play the main stage, {{performing}} seven sets of music over two nights. Several other bands, including Keller Williams and Manic Mule, played in the sidestage. The concert grounds, shaped like a large figure 8, contained several beer gardens, a Ferris wheel, an elephant, jugglers, and stiltsmen. At the festival, the audience made candles throughout the weekend. Saturday night's fourth set included an hour-long ambient jam on a dark stage covered in hundreds of homemade candles. On Sunday, the night ended with the band lighting fuses onstage, burning {{a path through the}} stage and activating a large elephant that sprayed a gusher of water into the <b>air</b> from its <b>trunk,</b> and then slowly made its way through the audience to the tune of [...] "Baby Elephant Walk" ...|$|R

40|$|African {{elephants}} (Loxodonta africana) {{produce a}} broad diversity of sounds ranging from infrasonic rumbles to much higher frequency trumpets. Trumpet calls are very loud voiced signals given by highly aroused elephants, {{and appear to}} be produced by a forceful expulsion of <b>air</b> through the <b>trunk.</b> Some trumpet calls have a very distinctive quality that is unique in the animal kingdom, but resemble the "brassy" sounds that can be produced with brass musical instruments such as trumpets or trombones. Brassy musical sounds are characterised by a flat spectral slope caused by the nonlinear propagation of the source wave as it travels through the long bore of the instrument. The extent of this phenomenon, which normally occurs at high intensity levels (e. g. fortissimo), depends on the fundamental frequency (F 0) of the source {{as well as on}} the length of the resonating tube. Interestingly, the length of the vocal tract of the elephant (as measured from the vocal folds to the end of the trunk) approximates the critical length for shockwave formation, given the fundamental frequency and intensity of trumpet calls. We suggest that this phenomenon could explain the unique, distinctive brassy quality of elephant trumpet calls...|$|R
50|$|The CSL {{also had}} various {{aesthetic}} modifications over the standard M3. It received an aerodynamic lightweight body kit which included carbon fibre front splitters that improved down force {{at high speeds}} by 50%, {{as well as a}} carbon fibre rear diffuser. The front bumper had a distinct hole that is used to draw cool air into the newly designed <b>air</b> intake. The <b>trunk</b> floor cover was made of lightweight fibre-board (not cardboard as infamously described by BBC Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson). The trunk lid was redesigned to incorporate a raised lip, unlike the standard M3 where one is simply added onto a flat trunk. The CSL was sold with distinct 19-inch lightweight cast BBS alloy rims that came with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup semi-slick racing tyres. The interior of the CSL is redesigned with a sporty weight-saving theme. The CSL obtains fibreglass front racing bucket seats, and fibreglass backed rear seats. The center console, door panels and trim, and head-liner are all formed from carbon fibre, and the steering wheel is redesigned with cruise control, stereo, and phone controls removed to include just a single button that activates the M track mode.|$|R
50|$|Trunks has {{appeared}} in most Dragon Ball related video games. He has also appeared in other related games such as Jump Super Stars, its sequel Jump Ultimate Stars, and Battle Stadium D.O.N. The game Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai - Another Road centers around Trunks' battle with Majin Boo in his future timeline. In 1992, Trunks would act as escort through time in the interactive Videkko game Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World. Trunks is also featured in the MMORPG Dragon Ball Online, where he {{is referred to as}} Time Patrol Trunks (Taimu Patorōru Torankusu). Trunks {{plays a major role in}} the plot of Dragon Ball: Xenoverse, helping the player to correct changes in the Dragon Ball timeline caused by the manipulations of Towa and Mira and fights the player in the game's climax alongside the game's main antagonist Demigra after becoming possessed by him. After the duo are defeated and Trunks is returned to normal, he intervenes when Demigra tries to take control of the player.In the Dragon Ball and One Piece crossover manga Cross Epoch, Trunks is a member of Captain Vegeta's <b>air</b> pirate crew. <b>Trunks</b> also made an appearance in the 2004 Fuji TV interactive feature Kyūtai Panic Adventure Returns!, where he and six other Dragon Ball characters delivered the Dragon Balls to restore the aqua city of Odaiba.|$|R
40|$|Elephants {{produce a}} broad range of sounds from very low {{frequency}} rumbles to higher frequency trumpets. Trumpets are produced by a forceful expulsion of <b>air</b> through the <b>trunk.</b> Trumpets are mainly tonal sounds. Elephants tend to trumpet when they are highly stimulated and the quality of trumpeting varies with the context. Some elephant trumpeting sounds are very similar to a trumpet or a trombone sound especially when playing “brassy”. This kind of brassy sounds played at high level dynamic, are made of a lot harmonics {{as a consequence of the}} wave steepening in the bore. The wave steepening is a cumulative effect obtained during the nonlinear propagation along the internal bore. A parameter to judge the severity of the nonlinear steepening is the critical shock length distance associated to a given input pressure profile. When the length of the bore is comparable to this critical distance, highly distorted waves can be observed in the bore, and it is the case for brass instruments played at fortissimo level. The internal bore of the vocal system of the elephant, from the vocal folds to the open end radiating the sound - trunk end - is several meters long, like brass instruments. The vocal system is so long than the nonlinear steepening effect might be significant during elephant trumpeting. This hypothesis is discussed from elephant trumpet's signals, and estimated by comparison with human voice and brass musical instruments under playing conditions...|$|R
