500|$|From {{the late}} 1980s, R.E.M. was {{involved}} in the local politics of its hometown of Athens, Georgia. Buck explained to Sounds in 1987, [...] "Michael <b>always</b> <b>says</b> think local and act local—we have {{been doing a lot of}} stuff in our town to try and make it a better place." [...] The band often donated funds to local charities and to help renovate and preserve historic buildings in the town. R.E.M.'s political clout was credited with the narrow election of Athens mayor Gwen O'Looney twice in the 1990s.|$|E

500|$|Manson {{confirmed}} {{during his}} {{appearance at the}} 2010 Revolver Golden Gods Awards in April that the band had recorded 13 songs, and also {{expressed an interest in}} releasing the record in a different way from previous ones. Fred Sablan – guitarist for Twiggy's side-project Goon Moon – joined the band in July, and in October Twiggy described the upcoming album as being [...] "almost done", saying: [...] "It's our best record yet. I mean, everyone <b>always</b> <b>says</b> that, but I think this is our best work so far. It's kind of like a little more of a punk rock Mechanical Animals, without sounding too pretentious." [...] Manson attested that its lyrical content would be [...] "more romantic" [...] yet [...] "self-abusive", and described its sonic elements as being [...] "suicide death metal".|$|E
500|$|Renwick {{has stated}} that the {{production}} of any further Jonathan Creek specials will depend on reception to [...] "The Grinning Man", {{as well as his}} own schedule. Davies is amenable to reprising the lead role in future, stating: [...] "If David writes more, I'm happy to do them. Unless they turned up and they were awful - but it hasn't happened so far. And he wouldn't send me an awful one anyway. But I don't know if he will come up with another one. He <b>always</b> <b>says</b> that the writing is so difficult, I'm not sure it gives him any pleasure. But I think the shooting gave him a lot of pleasure this time. He was directing {{for the first time and}} I think he really enjoyed it. So, we'll see." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} New York in October 1986. Madonna {{would ask for}} five minutes to study the script for the scene they were filming. For example, before {{a scene in which}} she needed to appear out of breath, she did a series of push-ups before going on set. Dunne {{observed}} that [...] " [...] likes her first take best. I think my best is around fourth. She <b>always</b> <b>says,</b> 'You got it, you got it,' and she was driving me crazy just like her character would. We had to make a compromise as to which take is the best." [...] Madonna wanted Foley to give her proper direction on set, but he preferred her to be her real self, rather than the persona in her music videos. Regarding her acting abilities, Foley stressed on the fact that Madonna was very uptight and into every detail, determined to have the correct portrayal. [...] "That's probably why it wasn't so good. In Desperately Seeking Susan, when she didn't know what she was doing, she was being natural and at her best." ...|$|E

500|$|Carey {{was unable}} to film an {{accompanying}} music video for the single; {{at the time of}} its release, she was recovering from a physical and emotional breakdown that left her hospitalized in August 2001, and caused her to cancel all public appearances to promote Glitter. She said, [...] "When I was asked about the video I said, 'I can't do it today'. And nobody could accept that answer. And that's when I started to get mad. I was, like, look, I am too fatigued. I'm overly-tired, I can't do it as a human being. And nobody was hearing those last two words — human being. They were used to the Mariah that <b>always</b> <b>says,</b> 'Come on, let's fight, let's go'. They just weren't used to me ever saying no. I never said no before". Instead, a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film, where Billie Frank (played by Carey) sings the song at Madison Square Garden during her first sold-out concert. Frank's performance of the song in the film omits its entire second verse, and the song's development runs in parallel with the film's love story.|$|E
500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that accused the character's bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, stated {{in an interview}} with Eurogamer, [...] "People were saying people were dead from the neck down. That's because we had all this animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. Once you get to the level that people can actually see that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of the}} body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games." [...] In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. [...] "It's funny. A lot of people say Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the questions you asked were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way we recorded it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone <b>always</b> <b>says</b> Aaron on the second question is a psycho. So that's not his fault." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later that night, at the post-fight press conference, Érik further {{explained}} his reasoning for brawling with the Filipino slugger; [...] "It {{was a great}} pleasure to fight this way. I think I was controlling the fight with my distance. Sometimes I need to put a little flavor into the ring. My promoter <b>always</b> <b>says</b> that I make the fights very difficult, but they're not difficult, they're fun for the public. I decided to stop myself in front of him in the twelfth round because I wanted to give the public what they deserve. It was a great round. I'm very happy about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Drea de Matteo as Joey's {{attractive}} {{older sister}} Gina Tribbiani, who is temperamental and promiscuous. Not particularly bright but very street-wise, Gina is a caring but over-protective and domineering mother. For years she convinced her genius son Michael {{that he was}} born when she was 22 instead of 16 years old, and <b>always</b> <b>says</b> {{he is the one}} thing she has done well. She and Joey are friends in addition to being siblings, both having the gift of being extremely appealing to the opposite sex, with numerous lovers. Initially working as a hairdresser, by season two she works as a secretary for Joey's agent Bobbie, having impressed Bobbie with her brash manner. In season two she starts dating Michael's father Jimmy once again. In the Season 2 episode [...] "Joey and the Holding Hands", it is implied that Gina may be bisexual.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2008 season, {{prior to}} the hiring of Gaston, the Blue Jays had a record of 35–39. Once Gaston and his coaches took over the Blue Jays went 51–37 to finish with an 86–76 record. The {{offensive}} improvements under Gaston {{were one of the}} reasons for the resurgence and as the hitting coach, Tenace was credited with rejuvenating a stagnant offense. Adam Lind commented: [...] "The thing is, a lot of people can teach you how to hit, but not a lot of people can teach you how to hit in the big leagues", referring to the major league experience of Gaston and Tenace.Blue Jays' former center fielder Vernon Wells has said he likes the approach to hitting that Tenace teaches: [...] "One thing Gene talks about is having that approach mentally when you go up there, in your mind you already guarantee yourself that one run on third, but you want to do more than that. Gene <b>always</b> <b>says</b> that first runner is a gimme, you should be able to come through in pretty much every situation like that. And then you try to do more damage than just that one run".|$|E
2500|$|The Tenth Doctor's era is also heavily revisited. [...] His {{marriage}} to Queen Elizabeth I, mentioned in [...] "The Shakespeare Code" [...] and The End of Time, is finally depicted. The Tenth Doctor mentioned the Fall of Arcadia in [...] "Doomsday". When the Eleventh Doctor tells Clara {{that the situation}} is [...] "timey-wimey stuff," [...] and the War Doctor ridicules him for it, the Tenth Doctor remarks, [...] "I have no idea where he picks that stuff up"; the Tenth originally used the phrase in [...] "Blink". When he leaves after learning of Trenzalore, the Tenth Doctor remarks, [...] "I don't want to go…", his incarnation's final words from The End of Time; the Eleventh Doctor tells Clara that [...] "he <b>always</b> <b>says</b> that" [...] after his TARDIS leaves. The Moment device was originally mentioned in The End of Time, but had not been explored in depth until now, where it takes the form of [...] "Bad Wolf", a seemingly omnipotent being and personalisation of the Time Vortex itself, which manifested in Rose Tyler when she absorbed the Time Vortex in the first series finale, [...] "The Parting of the Ways". During the negotiations with the Zygons Kate mentions the Sycorax from [...] "The Christmas Invasion".|$|E

2500|$|Upon parting with Interscope, Manson said [...] "a {{lot of the}} {{creative}} control on which my hands were tied [...] ", while stating that the band had been writing new material while touring their previous album. At the beginning of 2010, Vrenna {{said that they were}} [...] "talking and coming up with concepts" [...] for their upcoming studio album. Manson attested that its lyrical content would be [...] "more romantic" [...] yet [...] "self-abusive", and described its sonic elements as being [...] "suicide death metal". That April, Manson expressed interest in releasing the record in a different way from previous ones. Fred Sablan – bassist for Twiggy and Masters of Reality vocalist Chris Goss' project Goon Moon – joined the band in July. By October, Twiggy described the album as being [...] "almost done", and opined that [...] "It's our best record yet. I mean, everyone <b>always</b> <b>says</b> that, but I think this is our best work so far. It's kind of like a little more of a punk rock Mechanical Animals, without sounding too pretentious." [...] The following month, it was announced that the band had signed a joint-venture deal with London-based indie label Cooking Vinyl. As part of the deal, the band would retain creative control over their artistic direction, with the band and label sharing profits equally after the label recoups costs associated with marketing, promotion and distribution.|$|E
2500|$|The show's other {{prominent}} pairing, Nathan and Haley, {{emerged as a}} supercouple. James Lafferty, Nathan's portrayer, said, [...] "I think Nathan and Haley... Well Schwahn <b>always</b> <b>says</b> that he had that sort of as an 'ace in the hole' the entire time. As he was writing the pilot script, he was planning on doing that, he really didn't know how it would pan out or what would happen. But, the fans have responded so passionately towards it, and I'm not really sure why." [...] However, Lafferty has said {{that there is a}} genuine relationship between Nathan and Haley: [...] "It started as something sort of based on betrayal and deceit. It then kind of transgressed over into something based on actual true love. So, I think that it's a transition that the fans really bought into, and I think that people really enjoy to watch." [...] Schwahn called the couple [...] "gold" [...] and said, [...] "I love Nathan and Haley, and most of our audience does as well." [...] He explained that Nathan and Haley's fan base is strong because they have always been the most stable couple on the show, admitting that it confuses him when people ask when he is going to let them be happy. [...] "They have a lot of obstacles come their way," [...] said Schwahn, [...] "but I see them growing– especially with the jump [...] ahead and aging them a little bit– I see them growing into some really great places, not only as individuals, but as a family." ...|$|E
