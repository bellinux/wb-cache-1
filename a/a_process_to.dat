5|$|In 1738 in Great Britain, William Champion {{patented}} <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> extract zinc from calamine in {{a vertical}} retort style smelter. His technique resembled that used at Zawar zinc mines in Rajasthan, but no evidence suggests {{he visited the}} Orient. Champion's process was used through 1851.|$|E

5|$|Charles Thom (November 11, 1872 – May 24, 1956) was an American {{microbiologist}} and mycologist. Born {{and raised}} in Illinois, he received his PhD from the University of Missouri, the first such degree awarded by that institution. He was {{best known for his}} work on the microbiology of dairy products and soil fungi, and in particular his research into the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. His work influenced the establishment of standards for food handling and processing in the USA. He pioneered the use of culture media to grow microorganisms, and, with food chemist James N. Currie, developed <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> mass-produce citric acid using Aspergillus. Thom {{played an important role in}} the development of penicillin in World War II.|$|E

5|$|Genotyping arrays {{designed}} for GWAS rely on linkage disequilibrium to provide {{coverage of the}} entire genome by genotyping a subset of variants. Because of this, the reported associated variants {{are unlikely to be}} the actual causal variants. Associated regions can contain hundreds of variants spanning large regions and encompassing many different genes, making the biological interpretation of GWAS loci more difficult. Fine-mapping is <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> refine these lists of associated variants to a credible set most likely to include the causal variant.|$|E
5|$|Human rights {{agreements}} require most {{governments to}} provide {{family planning and}} contraceptive information and services. These include the requirement to create a national plan for family planning services, remove laws that limit access to family planning, ensure that {{a wide variety of}} safe and effective birth control methods are available including emergency contraceptives, make sure there are appropriately trained healthcare providers and facilities at an affordable price, and create <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> review the programs implemented. If governments fail to do the above it may put them in breach of binding international treaty obligations.|$|E
5|$|In October 2004, Totalprosjekt {{presented}} the concept Skibladner Stadion, {{which would have}} been located on Tjuvholmen, a peninsula which sticks out into Mjøsa. In addition to a 9,000-seat stadium, the project included a cultural center with an 800-seat auditorium and a 22-story hotel. However, Tjvuholmen is a popular recreational areas and <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> regulate the area as such had just been completed. The location would also cause problems for the railway, who wanted to expand Hamar Station. The Tjvuholmen project was rejected by the municipal executive committee on 8 December, and on 16 March 2005, the municipal council voted to continue working on a new venue at Briskeby. This caused Totalproject to leave the project.|$|E

5|$|Regarding air transport, Aarhus {{is served}} by the Aarhus Airport in Tirstrup about 35km {{northeast}} of the city centre. There has been much discussion about constructing a new airport closer to the city for many years, but so far, no plans have been realised. In August 2014, the city council officially initiated <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> assert the viability of a new international airport. A small seaplane now operates four flights daily between Aarhus harbour and Copenhagen harbour.|$|E
5|$|Thom's {{work with}} the food chemist James N. Currie in 1916–17 enabled them to develop <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> mass-produce citric acid using Aspergillus, {{and a few years}} later, the first {{large-scale}} mold fermentation factory had been established in Brooklyn, New York. This early work ultimately led to the Department of Agriculture's establishing four Regional Research Laboratories in 1938 that were devoted to industrial mold fermentations.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} nineteenth century, sugar was {{purchased}} in loaves, {{which had to be}} cut using implements called sugar nips. In later years, granulated sugar was more usually sold in bags. Sugar cubes were produced in the nineteenth century. The first inventor of <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> make sugar in cube form was the Moravian Jakub Kryštof Rad, director of a sugar company in Dačice. He began sugar cube production after being granted a five-year patent for the process on January 23, 1843. Henry Tate of Tate & Lyle was another early manufacturer of sugar cubes at his refineries in Liverpool and London. Tate purchased a patent for sugar cube manufacture from German Eugen Langen, who in 1872 had invented a different method of processing of sugar cubes.|$|E

5|$|On 20 September, the {{surviving}} relatives of each decedent received 2 million Russian rubles (about US$40,000) {{for each person}} {{who died in the}} accident. Ukrainian relatives stated to Norwegian media that they had not received information about the cause and other issues surrounding the accident. At the time, Ukraine was experiencing very high unemployment, and Arktikugol offered wages many times what was then offered in mainland Ukraine. Many miners not only had to support their immediate family, but also relatives. Vnukovo Airlines stated on Ukrainian television that the relatives would receive US$20,000 per deceased person. About a year after the accident, all relatives had been offered US$20,000, but about two-thirds of them chose not to accept the amount, and instead started <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> sue the insurance company. Their lawyer, Gunnar Nerdrum, stated that according to both Norwegian and Russian law, they could demand at least US$140,000.|$|E
5|$|While Degesch {{owned the}} rights to the brand name Zyklon and the patent on the {{packaging}} system, the chemical formula was owned by Degussa. Schlempe GmbH, which was 52 per cent owned by Degussa, owned {{the rights to}} <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> extract hydrogen cyanide from waste products of sugar beet processing. This process was performed under license by two companies, Dessauer Werke and Kaliwerke Kolin, who also combined the resulting hydrogen cyanide with stabilizer from IG Farben and a cautionary agent from Schering AG to form the final product, which was packaged using equipment, labels, and canisters provided by Degesch. The finished goods were sent to Degesch, who forwarded the product to two companies that acted as distributors: Heerdt-Linger GmbH (Heli) of Frankfurt and Tesch & Stabenow (Testa) of Hamburg. Their territory was split along the Elbe river, with Heli handling clients to the west and south, and Testa those to the east. Degesch owned 51 per cent of the shares of Heli, and until 1942 owned 55 per cent of Testa.|$|E
