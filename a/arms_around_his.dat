Scully successfully resuscitates Lisa. Jason confronts his elderly self in the computer mainframe room at the cryogenic lab, where the old man has erased all of Jason's files from the computer.

2500|$|Gunnhild was {{the patron}} and lover of Hrut Herjolfsson (or Hrútur Herjólfsson), an Icelandic {{chieftain}} who visited Norway {{during the reign}} of Gunnhild's son Harald. This dalliance was all the more scandalous given the difference in their ages; the fact that Gunnhild was a generation older than Hrut was considered noteworthy. Gunnhild engaged in public displays of affection with Hrut that were normally reserved for married couples, such as putting her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck in an embrace. Moreover, Gunnhild had Hrut sleep with her alone in [...] "the upper chamber." [...] Laxdaela Saga in particular describes the extent to which she became enamored of Hrut: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{grand duke}} was a lifelong bachelor, never {{involved}} in scandals. His cousin Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich {{accused him of}} misogyny in his book of memoirs, but this was contradicted with the close affective relationships he had with female members of his family. He was adored by his family and especially by his young nieces and nephews, with whom he would happily play and ride for hours. [...] He was particularly close {{to the children of}} his brother Konstantin. His nephew Prince Gabriel Konstantinovich [...] remembered him, as a [...] "wonderful, kind person" [...] who was almost a second father and wherever they saw him, they ran across the room, jumping up to hug him and wrap their <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck. Dmitry Konstantinovich also loved to tease the children and play practical jokes on them.|$|E

2500|$|In April 1919, Rheinschild {{was tried}} and {{found not guilty}} of {{complicity}} in an automobile theft; Rheinschild {{had been accused of}} hiding the automobile after it was stolen by another person. [...] In September 1919, Rheinschild was suspended from the practice of law for 18 months after being accused of unethical conduct in representing both parties in a loan transaction. [...] The Los Angeles Times reported that [...] "tears of mortification" [...] came into his eyes when the suspension was announced, and [...] "his young and attractive wife ran up to him and threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck and tenderly kissed him." [...] Two weeks later, the same judge reversed the suspension. [...] The following month, a different judge ordered Rheinschild disbarred, stating that the action was needed to set an example for other lawyers to restrain from similar conflicts of interest.|$|E
2500|$|Groucho {{maintained}} his irrepressible {{sense of humor}} to the very end, however. [...] George Fenneman, his radio and TV announcer, good-natured foil, and lifelong friend, often related a story {{of one of his}} final visits to Groucho's home: When the time came to end the visit, Fenneman lifted Groucho from his wheelchair, put his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> torso, and began to [...] "walk" [...] the frail comedian backwards across the room towards his bed. As he did, he heard a weak voice in his ear: [...] "Fenneman," [...] whispered Groucho, [...] "you always were a lousy dancer." [...] When a nurse approached him with a thermometer during his final hospitalization, explaining that she wanted to see if he had a temperature, he responded, [...] "Don't be silly—everybody has a temperature." [...] Actor Elliott Gould recalled a similar incident: [...] "I recall the last time I saw Groucho, he was in the hospital, and he had tubes in his nose and what have you," [...] he said. [...] "And when he saw me, he was weak, but he was there; and he put his fingers on the tubes and played them like it was a clarinet. Groucho played the tubes for me, which brings me to tears." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{service was}} {{conducted}} by the elderly and infirm Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who would be dead {{before the end of}} the year. He steadfastly refused to delegate any part of his duties and had to be supported throughout by two other bishops. Because of his failing eyesight, the text of the service had to be printed in gigantic type onto rolls of paper called [...] "prompt scrolls"; they are preserved in the Lambeth Palace Library. Archbishop Temple provided most of the upsets in an otherwise splendid ceremony; he was unable to rise after kneeling to pay homage and had to be helped up by the King and several bishops, he placed the crown back-to-front on the King's head, and when a colleague enquired after his well being, he was told to [...] "go away!" [...] in a loud voice that was plainly heard by the congregation. The King also deviated from the order of service; when the Prince of Wales touched the Crown and kissed his father's left cheek in the traditional gesture of homage, the King rose to his feet and threw his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> son's neck in an unusual display of affection. Because he was still convalescing, Edward had been crowned with the Imperial State Crown instead of the intended St Edward's Crown which is heavier. Alexandra was crowned immediately after her husband by William Dalrymple Maclagan, Archbishop of York. She was crowned with a new crown containing the Koh-i-Noor diamond.|$|E

2500|$|In the New York Daily News, Burns Mantle {{declared}} that [...] "Oklahoma! really is different – beautifully different. With {{the songs that}} Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, Oklahoma! {{seems to me to}} be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since Edna Ferber's Show Boat". New York World-Telegram critic Burton Rascoe particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that [...] "Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet , is actually the biggest hit of the show. The [...] "Out of My Dreams" [...] and [...] "All Er Nuthin'" [...] dances are such supreme aesthetic delights.... They are spinetingling, out of this world." [...] In The New York Sun, Ward Morehouse commented that [...] "Oklahoma! is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical," [...] as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. [...] "It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night's audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B." [...] Lorenz Hart himself [...] "pushed his way through the crowd at the after-show party in Sardi's restaurant and threw his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>his</b> ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear. He told Rodgers he had never had a better evening at the theater in his life." ...|$|E
