Homer's posse flee to the field, chased by Murdoch's security, until they get lost in the sea of victorious players.

In {{an attempt to get}} the worried staff under control, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Jim call a meeting to provide optimistic viewpoints, despite the steadily worsening news. In a moment of quick thinking, Michael pulls out a murder mystery party game called Belles, Bourbon, and Bullets and forces the rest of the staff to play along. The staff slowly warms up to the game. It is set in Savannah, Georgia, <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> to adopt a Southern accent. Thanks to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), and Phyllis Lapin-Vance (Phyllis Smith), the game becomes a hit. Everyone present starts to play along, except for Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) who tries to get updates on the situation from corporate and Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) who shows up late to work and flees after being told he is a suspect in a murder. Jim, however, believes that the entire exercise is pointless.|$|E
5|$|Voting is {{regarded}} as key to representative democracy, which requires that the leaders of a country are elected by the people. The basis of this concept is that everyone should be treated equally <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> equal rights. Every person, therefore, {{has a right to}} one vote, and no more, in the choice of representatives. The right to vote is a primary right, a right of fundamental importance by which other rights are protected. It is one of the important bulwarks of a representative democracy and in this regard, the ballot box is the people's ultimate mechanism to control the shaping of government policies. However, it must be recognized that voting is not an infallible litmus test for democracy; rather, it functions as a procedural device that is normally regarded as the best instrument for securing the ideal of self-governance.|$|E

In 2016 she disclosed to Variety that she took Miranda's soft speaking style from Clint Eastwood: [...] "He never, ever, ever raises his voice <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> to lean in to listen, and he is automatically the most powerful person in the room." [...] However, she said, Eastwood does not make jokes, so instead she modeled that aspect of the character on theatrical and film director Mike Nichols, whose delivery of a cutting remark, she said, made everyone laugh, including the target.

500|$|The series {{begins with}} opening credits that depict {{traditional}} Roman myths, such as Romulus and Remus, the city's foundation mythos.

VFX artist Kirk Balden said of production, [...] "On many projects, you start off with storyboards <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> {{a good idea of}} what it's going to look like when it's completed.

500|$|... "Take a Bow" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna and Babyface, {{and is a}} midtempo pop ballad with Japanese musical influences, like that of Kyu Sakamoto's 1961 song, [...] "Sukiyaki". It begins with sounds of oriental pentatonic strings, giving the impression of Chinese or Japanese opera. The verses consist of a descending chord sequence, containing twists at the end. Madonna's vocals are in a [...] "sleepy languid mood" [...] that is characteristic of the songs from Bedtime Stories. The lyrics during the chorus talk about Madonna saying goodbye to a lover, who had taken her for granted. The title plays upon the verse in the song [...] "all {{the world is a}} stage <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> their part", a reference to a line by William Shakespeare in his play As You Like It, [...] "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women mere players".|$|E
500|$|Co-creator J. J.

The team was discussing several different options, and the idea behind Fringe appealed to them most because it contained a long-term story and characters' backstories which were not [...] "evident but alluded to in the pilot". The team {{spent a lot of time}} thinking about the [...] "trifecta of characters" [...] that they needed to have in the series, and why there were uniquely interesting. The creators decided on the idea of a father-son story because it was compelling and accessible, [...] "you don't necessarily have to know anything about science, because everyone has a parent <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> issues with a parent. And I think for us it's always about coming into it through character". Orci stated that the series is a combination of a procedural and an [...] "extremely serialized and very culty" [...] series, quoting as examples of each, Law & Order and Lost.|$|E

500|$|Following its release, {{multiple}} critics {{found that}} the lyrics alluded to her turbulent high profile relationship with Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about [...] "one specific person". During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained {{the meaning of the}} album track-by-track, saying that [...] "Sober" [...] was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship: [...] "It's easy to run away from your feelings, but I have to understand, and people need to understand, that {{you have to go through}} everything. You have to feel it. You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> been in that situation where you can't help it. Even if it's not even that, it's like love drunk in a way." [...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be? Could it be about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure [...] "Camouflage" [...] is?" [...] Richard Braxter of Popology Now expressed doubt over Gomez's claims that the song wasn't about someone specific, saying: [...] "We’re sure there’s some weight to that, but we can’t help but think there’s some hints of Justin Bieber in this track." ...|$|E

Speaking about the post-production process in January 2016, the Russo brothers said, [...] "This has been the easiest post process we've ever had on a film. We're very happy with how the movie was. Everyone is very happy with where the movie was. For us, the tricky thing is the effects because it's a very complicated movie and there are some really big sequences in the film. The effects are on a much larger scale than the work we did on Winter Soldier. That's the part that becomes really difficult because you don't have a lot of time <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> very high standards. So everyone starts killing themselves at this point...we'll be done with the movie in two and a half months."

500|$|... "Forbidden Love", {{the seventh}} track on the album, finds Madonna {{comparing}} rejection to an aphrodisiac and dismissing any relationship untouched by taboo. Composed {{in a minor}} key with whispering voices in the background (one of them being of Babyface's), the song features a string section in the middle eight. The instrumentation is kept at minimum to emphasize the vocals, and the song ends with fading out. Track eight, [...] "Love Tried to Welcome Me", is a ballad which {{was inspired by a}} stripper Madonna met in a club, and has a fetish about rejection. The first 42 seconds consist of a string section, following which the verses start. The song projects a sombre and melancholy mood with Madonna lyrically asserting that she is [...] "drawn to sadness" [...] and [...] "loneliness has never been a stranger" [...] on the song. The next song on Bedtime Stories is [...] "Sanctuary" [...] where Madonna quotes Walt Whitman's poem Vocalism in the lyrics, and aligns love and death. Musically it has a [...] "techno pull" [...] and has an atmospheric introduction with an assortment of odd noises, electric guitar and some strings. The song is linked {{to the beginning of the}} next album track, [...] "Bedtime Story", which starts with its chords. It is an electronic song where Madonna wonders [...] "Words are useless, especially sentences, They don't stand for anything, How could they explain how I feel?" [...] The last song on the album [...] "Take a Bow" [...] is a midtempo pop ballad with a [...] "Sukiyaki"-like Japanese touch. The chorus expresses the theme of saying goodbye to a lover who had taken her for granted. The title plays upon the verse in the song [...] "all the world is a stage <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> their part", a reference to the line by William Shakespeare in his play As You Like It, [...] "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women mere players".|$|E
