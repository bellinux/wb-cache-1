50|$|A trickle ring is a {{circular}} drip irrigation device which evenly distributes water {{around the base}} of a tree or shrub. Connected to a water supply by a garden hose or tubing <b>adapter</b> <b>fitting,</b> trickle rings may be integrated into an irrigation network which waters many plants at the same time. By regulating the flow of water through the trickle ring, soil can be saturated at a rate which conserves water by minimizing wasteful surface runoff and losses due to evaporation.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{standardized}} methods in use to attach the hose or tube to the component. Some are intended for ease of use and service, others are better for higher system pressures or control of leakage. The most common method, in general, is to provide in each component a female-threaded port, on each hose or tube a female-threaded captive nut, and use a separate <b>adapter</b> <b>fitting</b> with matching male threads to connect the two. This is functional, economical to manufacture, and easy to service.|$|E
40|$|The Petite Amateur Navy Satellite (PANSAT) {{is a small}} {{communications}} satellite being developed at the Naval Postgraduate School. This thesis provides a structural design and analysis for the <b>adapter</b> <b>fitting</b> which mates PANSAT to the space shuttle Get Away Special (GAS) cannister launching system. Launch vehicle loading and interface requirements were combined with PANS AT design priorities to determine design specifications. Structural Dynamics Research Corporation's 1 -DEAS Masters Series software was utilized to model two adapter designs. The finite element solver in 1 -DEAS was {{used to analyze the}} two designs for strength and natural frequency. Design and analysis of fasteners, used to attach the <b>adapter</b> <b>fitting</b> to PANSAT, were also conducted. The results showed that a titanium alloy adapter, which does not shadow the solar arrays, and stainless steel fasteners exceeded all design specifications. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|E
