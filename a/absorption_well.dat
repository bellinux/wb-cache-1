By observing simultaneously in the near-infrared to hard X-ray band, we can well characterize {{the high end}} of the synchrotron component of the SED.

40|$|The {{sandstone}} {{is widely}} used as cladding stone, even in historic building. Its decay its commonly associated with the action of salts or with sulphation in polluted conditions. In fact, in many cases, the decreasing of mechanical properties under the action of salt crystallization and SO 2 {{is higher than the}} one induced by frost and by thermal shock action. The results of durability tests performed in laboratory or coming from literature data, referred to sand-stones even with differences in petrographic and mineralogical properties, are analysed. Three durability tests are object of this study: the determination of resistance to salt crystallisation according to EN 12370, the resis-tance to ageing by SO 2 action in the presence of humidity according to EN 13919, the determination of frost resistance according to EN 12371.

Optical absorption detected by STM offers direct imaging of molecular <b>absorption</b> <b>well</b> below the diffraction limit that hampers traditional spectroscopic methods. This technique is used to optically differentiate carbon nanotubes within nanometers of each other and, further, to resolve local variations in absorption within a single carbon nanotube. Provided from this is direct imaging of the spatial distribution of exciton generation from an optical absorption event. The interactions between light and single molecules are shown to be highly wavelength dependent and are very sensitive to the local electronic environment. Relating experimental thermodynamic and kinetic data to the dynamics on free energy surfaces can be cumbersome for all but the most trivial of cases. Many models have been developed to explain a variety of phenomena, but few methods are appropriate for cases with low kinetic barriers. Those methods that do fit free energy surfaces with low barriers are typically computationally expensive in multiple dimensions.

40|$|Remote sensing of the {{atmosphere}} from high earth orbit is very attractive due to the large field of view obtained and a true global perspective. This viewpoint is complicated by earth curvature effects so that slant path enhancement and absorption effects, small from low earth orbit, become dominant even at small nadir view angles. The effect is further complicated by the large range of local times and solar zenith angles in a single image leading to a modulation of the image intensity by {{a significant portion of}} the diurnal height variation of the absorbing layer. The latter effect is significant in particular for mesospheric, stratospheric and auroral emissions due to their depth in {{the atmosphere}}. As a particular case, the emissions from atomic oxygen (130. 4 and 135. 6 nm) and molecular nitrogen (two LBH bands, LBHS from 140 to 160 nm and LBHL from 160 to 180 nm) as viewed from the Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) are examined. The LBH emissions are of particular interest since LBHS has significant 02 absorption while LBHL does not, In the case of auroral emissions this differential <b>absorption,</b> <b>well</b> examined in the nadir, gives information about the height of the emission and therefore the energy of the precipitating particles. Using simulations of the viewing geometry and images from the UVI we examine these effects and obtain correction factors to adjust to the nadir case with a significant improvement of the derived characteristic energy. There is a surprisingly large effect on the images from the 02 diurnal layer height changes. An empirical compensation to the nadir case is explored based on the local nadir and local zenith angles for each portion of the image. These compensations are demonstrated as applied to the above emissions in both auroral and dayglow images and compared to models. The extension of these findings to other instruments, emissions and spectral regions is examined...|$|E
40|$|We propose key {{modifications}} to the Toon et al. (1977) model of the particle size distribution and composition of Mars atmospheric dust, based {{on a variety of}} spacecraft and wavelength observations of the dust. A much broader (r(sub eff) variance- 0. 8 micron), smaller particle size (r(sub mode) - 0. 02 microns) distribution coupled with a "palagonite-like" composition is argued to fit the complete ultraviolet-to- 30 -micron absorption properties of the dust better than the montmorillonite-basalt r(sub eff) variance= 0. 4 micron, r(sub mode) = 0. 40 micron dust model of Toon et al. Mariner 9 (infrared interferometer spectrometer) IRIS spectra of high atmospheric dust opacities during the 1971 - 1972 Mars global dust storm are analyzed in terms of the Toon et al. dust model, and a Hawaiian palagonite sample with two different size distribution models incorporating smaller dust particle sizes. Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper (IRTM) emission-phase-function (EPF) observations at 9 microns are analyzed to retrieve 9 -micron dust opacities coincident with solar band dust opacities obtained from the same EPF sequences. These EPF dust opacities provide an independent measurement of the visible/ 9 -microns extinction opacity ratio (> or equal to 2) for Mars atmospheric dust, which is consistent with a previous measurement by Martin (1986). Model values for the visible/ 9 -microns opacity ratio and the ultraviolet and visible single-scattering albedos are calculated for the palagonite model with the smaller particle size distributions and compared to the same properties for the Toon et al. model of dust. The montmorillonite model of the dust is found to fit the detailed shape of the dust 9 -micron <b>absorption</b> <b>well.</b> However, it predicts structured, deep absorptions at 20 microns which are not observed and requires a separate ultraviolet-visible absorbing component to match the observed behavior of the dust in this wavelength region. The modeled palagonite does not match the 8 - to 9 -micron absorption presented by the dust in the IRIS spectra, probably due to its low SiO 2 content (31 %). However, it does provide consistent levels of ultraviolet/visible absorption, 9 - to 12 -micron absorption, and a lack of structured absorption at 20 microns. The ratios of dust extinction opacities at visible, 9 microns, and 30 microns are strongly affected by the dust particle size distribution. The Toon et al. dust size distribution (r(sub mode) = 0. 40, r(sub eff) variance= 0. 4 microns, r(sub cw mu) = 2. 7 microns) predicts the correct ratio of the 9 - to 30 -micron opacity, but underpredicts the visible/ 9 -micron opacity ratio considerably (1 versus > or equal to 2). A similar particle distribution width with smaller particle sizes (r(sub mode) = 0. 17, r(sub eff) variance= 0. 4 microns, r(sub cw mu) = 1. 2 microns) will fit the observed visible/ 9 -micron opacity ratio, but overpredicts the observed 9 -micron/ 30 -micron opacity ratio. A smaller and much broader particle size distribution (r(sub mode) = 0. 02, r(sub eff) variance= 0. 8 microns, r(sub cw mu) = 1. 8 microns) can fit both dust opacity ratios. Overall, the nanocrystalline structure of palagonite coupled with a smaller, broader distribution of dust particle sizes provides a more consistent fit than the Toon et al. model of the dust to the IRIS spectra, the observed visible/ 9 -micron dust opacity ratio, the Phobos occultation measurements of dust particle sizes, and the weakness of surface near IR absorptions expected for clay minerals...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the theoretical and experimental investigation of volume holography operated with broadband/polychromatic light sources, i. e., in both continuous-wave (linear) and femtosecond-pulse (nonlinear) regimes. The first chapter reviews {{the concept of}} volume holography and provides a tacit introduction to some basic properties of volume holograms and compares the operation of holograms in the spatial and temporal domains, preparing the readers for later chapters. The second chapter introduces a powerful theoretical tool {{for the analysis of}} volume holograms in the reflection geometry: the matrix formulation, laying the foundation for the application of holographic gratings utilized as WDM filters. The third chapter takes into consideration the effects of the practically inevitable finite beam-widths. By means of Fourier decomposition, the deviation of the filtering properties of volume holographic gratings from the ideal plane-wave case can be satisfactorily explained and predicted. Experiments and simulations are performed and compared to confirm the validity of the theory. Volume holographic gratings in the reflection geometry serve as excellent WDM filters for telecommunication purposes thanks to their low cross-talk and readily engineered filtering properties. The theoretical design and experimental realization of athermal holographic filters are presented in the fourth chapter. By incorporating a passive, thermally actuated MEMS mirror, the temperature dependence of the Bragg wavelength of a holographic filter can be compensated. The analysis of holographic gratings in the 90 degree geometry requires a two dimensional theory. The relevant boundary conditions give rise to some peculiar behaviors in this configuration. Theory, simulations and some experimental results of the 90 -degree holography are presented in chapter five. The sixth chapter delves into the subject of instantaneous Kerr index grating established by two intense, interfering femtosecond (pump) pulses at 388 nm owing to the omnipresent third-order nonlinearity. The coupled-mode equations describing the incident and diffracted (probe) pulses at 776 nm are written down; the solution is experimentally corroborated. It is further demonstrated that the temporal resolution in such a holographic pump-probe configuration does not degrade appreciably as the angular separation between pump pulses increases. Chapter seven investigates the nonlinear absorption processes in lithium niobate crystals with femtosecond pulses. The model of two-photon <b>absorption</b> <b>well</b> explains and anticipates the transmission coefficients of single pulses over a wide range of intensity. Collinear pump-probe transmission experiments are then carried out to look into the nonlinear absorption suffered by the probe pulse at 776 nm owing to the pump pulse at 388 nm; the dependence of the probe pulse transmission coefficient on the time delay between pump and probe pulses is characterized by a dip and a long-lasting plateau, which are attributed, respectively, to direct two-photon transitions involving pump and probe photons and the existence of free carriers. Building on the experimental experience and theoretical understanding of the previous two chapters, the results of holographic pump-probe experiments in lithium niobate crystals are presented in the final chapter. The behavior is much more complicated because it encompasses all phenomena explored in the two preceding chapters, i. e., both the real and imaginary parts of the third-order susceptibility come into play in the instantaneous material response; furthermore, another mixed grating due to excited charge carriers exists long after the pump pulses pass through. Valuable information on the grating formation process is obtained thanks to the sub-picosecond temporal resolution of such configurations...|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} of UK even-aged conifer plantations to continuous cover forestry (CCF), {{a form of}} forest management that maintains forest cover over time and avoids clear-cutting, requires more frequent and spatially explicit monitoring of forest structure than traditional systems. Key aims of CCF management are to increase the spatial heterogeneity of forest stands and to make increased use of natural regeneration, but judging success in meeting these objectives and allowing an adaptive approach to management requires information on spatial structure at a within-stand scale. Airborne remote sensing provides an alternative approach to field survey and has potential to meet these monitoring needs over large areas. An integral part of CCF {{is the creation of}} canopy gaps, allowing regeneration by increasing understorey light levels. This study examined the use of airborne lidar and passive optical data for the identification and characterisation of canopy gaps within UK Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) plantations. The potential for using the distribution of canopy and gaps within a stand to quantify spatial heterogeneity and allow the detection of changes in spatial structure, between stands and over time, was assessed. Detailed field surveys of six study plots, located in three UK spruce plantations, allowed assessment of the accuracy of gap delineation from remotely sensed data. Airborne data (multispectral, hyperspectral and lidar) were acquired for all sites. A novel approach to the delineation of gaps from lidar data was developed, delineating gaps directly from the lidar point cloud, avoiding the interpolation errors (and associated under-estimation of gap area) resulting from conversion to a canopy height model. This method resulted in improved accuracy of delineation compared to past techniques (overall accuracy of 78 % compared to field gap delineations), especially when applied to lidar data collected at relatively low point densities. However, lidar data can be costly to acquire and provides little information about the presence of natural regeneration or other understorey vegetation within gaps. For these reasons, the potential of passive optical (and in particular, hyperspectral) data for gap delineation was also considered. The use of spectral indices, based on shortwave infrared reflectance or hyperspectral characteristics of the red- edge and chlorophyll <b>absorption</b> <b>well,</b> were shown to enhance the discrimination of canopy and gap and reduce the influence of illumination conditions. An average overall accuracy of 71 % was obtained using hyperspectral characteristics for gap delineation, suggesting the use of optical data compares reasonably to results from lidar. Methods based on shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance were shown to be sensitive to within gap vegetation type, with SWIR reflectance being lower in the presence of natural regeneration. Potential for using optical data to classify within gap vegetation type was also demonstrated. Methods of quantifying spatial structure through the use of indices describing variations in gap size, shape and distribution were found to allow the detection of structural differences between stands and changes over time. Gap distribution based indices were also found to be strongly related to alternative methods based on relative tree positions, suggesting significant potential for consistent monitoring of structural changes during {{conversion of}} plantations to CCF. Remotely sensed delineations of canopy gap distribution may also allow spatially explicit modelling of understorey light conditions and potential for regeneration, providing further information to aid the effective management of CCF forests.

In addition, unexpected behaviour may result from non-ideality in solute-vehicle-skin effects, including dehydration, chemical enhancement, supersaturation, metabolism, sequestration and vascular effects, including those of nanosystems on the local vasculature. In general, in vitro skin penetration profiles are predictive of in vivo profiles but a number of exceptions also exist...|$|R
