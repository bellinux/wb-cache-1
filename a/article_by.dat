40|$|The {{main goal}} of a writer, when he/she writes a text, is to draw the reader’s {{attention}} to the text, and to make them converge with it. Therefore, a reading text includes an interaction between the writer and the reader. This interaction in instructional texts leads to a better learning by the language learners. There are some markers in the reading texts that create an interaction between the writer and the reader,and lead to a better comprehensionbythe reader of the text he/she is reading and a more detailed understanding. The use of these interactional markers in texts is an undeniable necessity. This study investigates the frequency of using these markers in Persian and English written texts by native speakers of Persian and non-Persians within the Hyland’sInteractional Model (Hyland, 2005), and analyzes the method of interaction between the writer and the reader in 3 categories of scientific <b>articles</b> (Persian <b>articles</b> <b>by</b> native speakers of Persian,Persian <b>articles</b> <b>by</b> nonnative speakers of Persian, English <b>articles</b> <b>by</b> non-Persians). This study is both quantitative and qualitative. The {{analysis of the data}} shows that the highest use of interactional markers in the whole corpus is in “personal asides” and the lowest use is in “interrogative sentences”. Furthermore, having in mind that these markers are divided into “stance” and “engagement” markers, in the stance marker category in Persian <b>articles</b> <b>by</b> native speakers of Persian and English <b>articles</b> <b>by</b> non-Persians, the highest use of these markers includes the “hedges” and the lowest useincludes “attitude markers,” and in Persian <b>articles</b> <b>by</b> non-native speakers of Persian, the highest frequency of use is that of “boosters” andthe lowest, like the other two categories, is that of “attitude markers”. Also, in the engagement category, in Persian <b>articles</b> <b>by</b> native speakers of Persian and Persian <b>articles</b> <b>by</b> non-native speakers of Persian, the highest frequency of useis that of “personal asides” and the lowest is that of “directives,” and in English <b>articles</b> <b>by</b> non-Persians, the highest frequency of use, like the other aforementioned categories includes “personal asides” and the lowest includes “interrogative sentences. ”...|$|R

5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} with {{a speech at}} Bowling Green on August26, 1899. He answered many allegations {{that had been made}} about him, including claims that he had secretly been seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination all along, that he had ambitions of succeeding Senator William Joseph Deboe, and that following the nominating convention, he had agreed to speak on behalf of the Goebel ticket. Brown conceded that he desired Senator Deboe's senate seat and that he had agreed to accept the gubernatorial nomination if it had been offered to him, but he denied that he had ever agreed to speak on Goebel's behalf. Outgoing Senator Blackburn also charged that Brown was bolting the party again, just as he had in supporting Stephen Douglas over John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860. Brown replied by quoting an <b>article</b> <b>by</b> William Jennings Bryan's Omaha World-Herald that asserted the right of an individual to vote against the nominee of his party if the individual deemed the nominee unfit.|$|E
5|$|Further {{support for}} the {{association}} between autism and thiomersal appeared in an <b>article</b> <b>by</b> Robert F.

Although the allegations by Kennedy were denied and a US Senate committee investigation later found no evidence to substantiate the most serious allegations, the story had already been well publicized by leveraging Kennedy's celebrity. Salon magazine subsequently amended Kennedy's article five times due to factual errors and later retracted it completely on January 16, 2011, stating that the works of critics of the article and evidence of the flaws in the science connecting autism and vaccines undermined {{the value of the}} article to the editors.|$|E
