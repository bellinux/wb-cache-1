The cabin {{is believed to}} have been built by early Swedish settlers who were part of the New Sweden colony. The cabin was most likely built between 1638 and 1655, but the exact year is not known. Log cabin architecture was a major contribution of the colonial Swedes. European settlers from other countries copied this style of housing, and the log cabin became popular <b>all</b> <b>across</b> <b>America.</b>|$|E
500|$|Scarface {{provoked}} outrage {{mainly because}} of its unprecedented violence, but also for its shifts of tone from serious to comedic. Dave Kehr, writing in the Chicago Reader, stated that the film blends [...] "comedy and horror {{in a manner that}} suggests Chico Marx let loose with a live machine gun." [...] In one scene, Camonte is inside a cafe while a torrent of machine-gun fire from the car of a rival gang is headed his way; when the barrage is over, Camonte picks up one of the newly released tommy guns the gangsters dropped and exhibits childlike wonder and unrestrained excitement over the new toy. Civic leaders became furious that gangsters like Capone (who was also the inspiration for Little Caesar) were being applauded in movie houses <b>all</b> <b>across</b> <b>America.</b> The screenplay, adapted by Ben Hecht who was a journalist in Chicago, contained biographical details for Muni's character in Scarface that were so obviously taken from Capone, and the detail so close, that it was impossible not to draw the parallels.|$|E

[...] In one scene, Camonte is inside a cafe while a torrent of machine gun fire from the car of a rival gang is headed his way. His bumbling assistant, following orders from Camonte, keeps trying to answer the phone instead of ducking even after the gangsters make several passes by the cafe. After the barrage is over, Camonte picks up a tommy gun one of the mobsters dropped, and exhibits child like wonder and unrestrained excitement over the new toy. Civic leaders became furious that gangsters like Capone (who was also the blatant inspiration for Little Caesar) were being applauded in movie houses <b>all</b> <b>across</b> <b>America.</b> Some of the biographical details that were used for Muni's character in Scarface were so obviously taken from Capone, and the detail so close, that it was impossible not to draw the parallels. Capone sent several members of his gang to threaten screenwriter Ben Hecht, but Hecht was able to convince them the picture was based on other gangsters. When Scarface was released however, Capone adored the film, and purchased a personal copy. The film remained out of circulation, until Hughes's death in 1976. Universal then re-released the picture, but some scenes from the film's original cut are lost.|$|E

2500|$|Critics have {{objected to}} the show's usage of {{violence}} by dressing it with pretty photography.

Civic leaders in Miami have also {{objected to the}} show's airing of the city's crime problems <b>all</b> <b>across</b> <b>America.</b> Most civic leaders, however, have been placated due to the show's estimated contribution of $1 million per episode to the city's economy and boosting tourism to Miami. Gerald S. Arenberg of the National Association of Chiefs of Police criticized the show's glamorous depiction of vice squads, saying [...] "no real vice cops chase drug dealers in a Ferrari while wearing $600 suits.

However, on October 19, 2008, Powell announced his endorsement of Barack Obama during a Meet the Press interview, citing [...] "his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out <b>all</b> <b>across</b> <b>America,</b> because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities", in addition to his [...] "style and substance." [...] He additionally referred to Obama as a [...] "transformational figure". Powell further questioned McCain's judgment in appointing Sarah Palin as the vice presidential candidate, stating that {{despite the fact that she}} is admired, [...] "now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks, I don't believe she's ready to be president of the United States, which is the job of the vice president." [...] He said that Obama's choice for vice-president, Joe Biden, was ready to be president. He also added that he was [...] "troubled" [...] by the [...] "false intimations that Obama was Muslim." [...] Powell stated that [...] " [...] is a Christian—he's always been a Christian... But the really right answer is, what if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer's no, that's not America." [...] Powell then mentioned Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan, a Muslim American soldier in the U.S. Army who served and died in the Iraq War. He later stated, [...] "Over the last seven weeks, the approach of the Republican Party has become narrower and narrower [...] I look at these kind of approaches to the campaign, and they trouble me." [...] Powell concluded his Sunday morning talk show comments, [...] "It isn't easy for me to disappoint Sen. McCain in the way that I have this morning, and I regret that [...] I think we need a transformational figure. I think we need a president who is a generational change and that's why I'm supporting Barack Obama, not out of any lack of respect or admiration for Sen. John McCain." [...] Later in a December 12, 2008, CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, Powell reiterated his belief that during the last few months of the campaign, Palin pushed the Republican party further to the right and had a polarizing impact on it.|$|E
