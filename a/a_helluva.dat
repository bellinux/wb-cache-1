40|$|The {{past two}} years have been {{two of the most}} {{difficult}} I have faced. My journey as a student has nearly ended on numerous occasions, and {{if it were not for}} a few close people in my life I am not sure this paper could have been written. First of all I need to give massive thanks to Brian Harper who stepped up after my admitted hiatus of the brain, helped me get back on track and agreed to be my Committee Chair within the first thirty minutes of meeting me. Plus? You are HILARIOUS. THANK YOU. Secondly, I would like to give thanks to Stephen Duffy who has, on several occasions, paid for my lunches, software, and travel, and cracked me up in response to things I probably was not supposed to be laughing at. I am pretty sure that without you, my graduate school experience would have been completely different and sucked <b>a</b> whole <b>helluva</b> lot more. And even though you’re not here (insert squinty, menacing eyes here), I want to thank my academic advisor and resident statistical genius, Dr. Joshua Bagaka’s. I really don’t know if I could have made it through stats without you. What a teacher you are...|$|R
500|$|Oklahoma {{head coach}} Wilkinson {{declined}} to declare his team the national champions. He addressed his {{team in the}} locker room, saying, [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>helluva</b> ball game.

500|$|During the {{campaign}} from Normandy into Germany, Salinger {{arranged to meet}} with Ernest Hemingway, a writer who had influenced him and was then working as a war correspondent in Paris. Salinger was impressed with Hemingway's friendliness and modesty, finding him more [...] "soft" [...] than his gruff public persona. Hemingway was impressed by Salinger's writing and remarked: [...] "Jesus, he has <b>a</b> <b>helluva</b> talent." [...] The two writers began corresponding; Salinger wrote Hemingway in July 1946 that their talks were among his few positive memories of the war. Salinger added that {{he was working on}} a play about Holden Caulfield, the protagonist of his story [...] "Slight Rebellion off Madison", and hoped to play the part himself.|$|E
500|$|John Briggs {{was forced}} {{to drop out of}} the 1978 race for California governor, but {{received}} enthusiastic support for Proposition 6, dubbed the Briggs Initiative. The proposed law would have made firing gay teachers—and any public school employees who supported gay rights—mandatory. Briggs' messages supporting Proposition 6 were pervasive throughout California, and Harvey Milk attended every event Briggs hosted. Milk campaigned against the bill throughout the state as well, and swore that even if Briggs won California, he would not win San Francisco. In their numerous debates, which toward the end had been honed to quick back-and-forth banter, Briggs maintained that homosexual teachers wanted to abuse and recruit children. Milk responded with statistics compiled by law enforcement that provided evidence that pedophiles identified primarily as heterosexual, and dismissed Briggs' assertions with one-liner jokes: [...] "If it were true that children mimicked their teachers, you'd sure have <b>a</b> <b>helluva</b> lot more nuns running around." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tombaugh's widow Patricia stated {{after the}} IAU's {{decision}} that while Clyde {{may have been}} disappointed with the change, since he had resisted attempts to remove Pluto's planetary status in his lifetime, he would have accepted the decision now if he were alive. She noted that he [...] "was a scientist. He would understand they had a real problem when they start finding several of these things flying around the place." [...] Hal Levison offered this perspective on Tombaugh's place in history: [...] "Clyde Tombaugh discovered the Kuiper Belt. That's <b>a</b> <b>helluva</b> lot {{more interesting than the}} ninth planet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although its {{legitimacy}} {{is often called}} into question, competitive marching band is sometimes considered a sport, {{due in large part}} to the physical exertion required in combination with teamwork. Many HBCU marching band fans refer to band as marching sport. Sports Illustrated considered the activity a sport in 1987, describing the Drum Corps International World Championships “one of the biggest sporting events of the summer.” In the same article, Sports Illustrated quoted basketball coach Bobby Knight, [...] "If a basketball team trained as hard as these kids do, it would be unbelievable. I like to take my players [...] to show them what they can accomplish with hard work and teamwork. Besides, once they see them practice 12 hours a day, my players think I’m <b>a</b> <b>helluva</b> lot easier.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid-1957, Garcia began smoking {{cigarettes}} and {{was introduced to}} marijuana. Garcia would later reminisce about {{the first time he}} smoked marijuana: [...] "Me and a friend of mine went up into the hills with two joints, the San Francisco foothills, and smoked these joints and just got so high and laughed and roared and went skipping down the streets doing funny things and just having <b>a</b> <b>helluva</b> time". During this time, Garcia also studied at what is now the San Francisco Art Institute. The teacher there was Wally Hedrick, an artist who came to prominence during the 1960s. During the classes, he often encouraged Garcia in his drawing and painting skills. Hedrick also introduced Garcia to the fiction of Jack Kerouac, whom Garcia later cited as a major influence.|$|E
2500|$|By age 13, {{she became}} serious about {{pursuing}} a music career, though she still concentrated on theater. When she {{first arrived in}} Los Angeles to meet with her managers, she {{expressed a desire to}} record an R album: [...] "I was like, 'I want to make an R album,' They were like 'Um, that's <b>a</b> <b>helluva</b> goal! Who is going to buy a 14-year-old's R album?!'" [...] In 2008, Grande was cast in the supporting role of cheerleader Charlotte in the musical 13 on Broadway, for which she won a National Youth Theatre Association Award.

2500|$|Burroughs {{moved to}} Lawrence, Kansas in 1981, taking up {{residence}} at 1927 Learnard Avenue {{where he would}} {{spend the rest of}} his life. He once told a Wichita Eagle reporter that he was content to live in Kansas, saying, [...] "The thing I like about Kansas is that it's not nearly as violent, and it's <b>a</b> <b>helluva</b> lot cheaper. And I can get out in the country and fish and shoot and whatnot." [...] In 1984, he signed a seven-book deal with Viking Press after he signed with literary agent Andrew Wylie. This deal included the publication rights to the unpublished 1952 novel Queer. With this money he purchased a small bungalow for $29,000. He was finally inducted into the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1983 after several attempts by Allen Ginsberg to get him accepted. He attended the induction ceremony in May 1983. Lawrence Ferlinghetti remarked the induction of Burroughs into the Academy proved Herbert Marcuse's point that capitalistic society had a great ability to incorporate its one-time outsiders.|$|E
