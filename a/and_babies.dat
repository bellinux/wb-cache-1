25|$|The {{long-term}} effects of war rape in Rwanda on its victims include social isolation (the social stigma attached to rape meant that some husbands left their wives who had become victims of war rape, or that the victims became unmarriageable), unwanted pregnancies <b>and</b> <b>babies</b> (some women resorted to self-induced abortions), sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis, gonorrhoea and HIV/Aids (access to anti-retroviral drugs remains limited).|$|E
25|$|Speculation {{explaining}} {{a relationship}} between birth weight and maternal pelvis size has been proposed. The explanation, based on Darwinian-inspired logic, states that {{since the advent of}} successful Caesarean birth more mothers with small pelvises <b>and</b> <b>babies</b> with large birth weights survive. This hypothesis would predict an increased average birth weight, which has been observed. It is unclear what component contributes more to this effect; evolution or environment.|$|E

25|$|Scottish author George MacDonald {{also wrote}} a fantasy novel {{entitled}} Lilith, {{first published in}} 1895. MacDonald employed the character of Lilith in service to a spiritual drama about sin and redemption, in which Lilith finds a hard-won salvation. Many of the traditional characteristics of Lilith mythology {{are present in the}} author's depiction: Long dark hair, pale skin, a hatred and fear of children <b>and</b> <b>babies,</b> and an obsession with gazing at herself in a mirror. MacDonald's Lilith also has vampiric qualities: she bites people and sucks their blood for sustenance.|$|E
25|$|There were {{pros and}} cons to the ABCC. The cons: they {{overlooked}} Japanese needs in small details. The flooring {{in the waiting room}} for mothers <b>and</b> <b>babies</b> was polished linoleum, and women in their wooden clogs would often slip and fall. The signs and magazines in the waiting rooms were in English. The ABCC did not actually treat the survivors they studied, they just studied them over periods of time. They had them come for examination during weekday working hours, causing the person to lose a day of pay, and they offered little compensation to the survivors.|$|E

50|$|The {{postpartum}} period begins {{after the}} delivery of the placenta. In Hindu communities, a “sutak” or “pollution confinement” period, which is a length of time for which the mother <b>and</b> <b>baby</b> are considered unclean, follows the birth. The mother <b>and</b> <b>baby</b> are {{in a place of}} confinement, usually a room in the home, during the “sutak” period. This can range in length from 3 to 10 days, and no family or community members may interact with the mother <b>and</b> <b>baby</b> during this time. At the end of this period, a “kuan pujan” or “ceremony at the well” occurs, in which the mother <b>and</b> <b>baby</b> are purified <b>and</b> considered clean. In Muslim communities, this period does not exist. The baby is sprinkled with holy water in a ritual bath.|$|R

25|$|Electrical Cardiometry is a {{non-invasive}} method similar to Impedance cardiography; both methods measure thoracic electrical bioimpedance (TEB). The underlying model differs {{between the two}} methods; Electrical cardiometry attributes the steep increase of TEB beat-to-beat to the change in orientation of red blood cells. Four standard ECG electrodes are required for measurement of cardiac output. Electrical Cardiometry is a method trademarked by Cardiotronic, Inc., and shows promising results {{in a wide range}} of patients. It is currently approved in the US for use in adults, children <b>and</b> <b>babies.</b> Electrical cardiometry monitors have shown promise in postoperative cardiac surgical patients, in both haemodynamicially stable and unstable cases.|$|E
25|$|There {{are special}} risks to {{consider}} for older adults, {{women who are}} pregnant, <b>and</b> <b>babies.</b> When a person ages, the body becomes less able to rid itself of barbiturates. As a result, people {{over the age of}} sixty-five are at higher risk of experiencing the harmful effects of barbiturates, including drug dependence and accidental overdose. When barbiturates are taken during pregnancy, the drug passes through the placenta to the fetus. After the baby is born, it may experience withdrawal symptoms and have trouble breathing. In addition, nursing mothers who take barbiturates may transmit the drug to their babies through breast milk. A rare adverse reaction to barbiturates is Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which primarily affects the mucous membranes.|$|E
