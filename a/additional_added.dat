30|$|Damping is an {{important}} design criterion for micro- and nanometer sized resonators, because surface forces dominate body forces at small dimensions [1]. Immersing a resonator, e.g., a microcantilever, in fluid drastically changes its dynamic properties. The eigenfrequencies and quality factors decrease due to hydrodynamic forces, which can be decomposed into an inertial (added mass) and dissipative (viscous damping) term [2]. Additionally, placing the resonator close to a solid surface leads to squeeze-film damping, where displacement of the fluid between the resonator and the surface during each vibration period introduces <b>additional</b> <b>added</b> mass and viscous damping [3]. The damping occurring by both mechanisms has direct impact on atomic force microscopy (AFM) and dynamically operated nanomechanical sensors. With progressing miniaturization, squeeze-film damping starts to dominate other dissipative effects and, thus, needs to be considered and characterized [4].|$|E
40|$|Part III: Sustainable ServicesInternational audienceServitization, the {{offering}} of product-services, {{is a more}} and more pervasive concept. When applied correctly, it exploits the product and generates <b>additional</b> <b>added</b> value for the manufacturer as for the customer. Until now, servitization has been applied only onto the usage phase of the product, creating services around it. However the product {{is not the only}} valuable and tradable asset in a manufacturing enterprise. Therefore this article scrutinizes the possibility to additionally exploit the manufacturer’s value chain, by servitizing its components and hence transforming them into products per se. To test this possibility Thoben’s seminal representation of servitization was taken and applied onto the components of the value chain identified by Porter. It was elucidated that the proposed concept is feasible and under certain circumstances, it increases the seller’s and buyer’s sustainable competitive advantage. The article concludes by questioning the effect of this novel concept onto sustainability...|$|E

40|$|This is {{a report}} on the {{evaluation}} of the Swedish participation in the Halden Reactor Project 2006 - 2014. The study has consisted in evaluating the types and extent of added value from the Swedish participation in the Halden Reactor Project, and to determine what <b>additional</b> <b>added</b> value the participation could supply for the Swedish authority. It can be concluded from the study that the impacts from the Halden Reactor Project are extensive and wide ranging, reaching beyond the scope of what has been possible to cover in the evaluation. This limitation is mainly due to the long history and continuity of the collaboration, extending far beyond the scope of the study. The evaluation further concludes that the Halden Reactor Project has come to play a systemic role for the nuclear sector in Sweden, supplying significant portions of the data underlying safety oriented research and development within the areas concerned. These impacts have mainly been realized in industry, and are promoted in particular by voluntary, bottom-up coordination and engagement by industry stakeholders. Academia has seen little added value from the Swedish participation in the Halden Reactor Project, while the public sector has benefited somewhat, however, its engagement has been limited in comparison with peer countries Finland and Switzerland. The evaluation team recommends that the Swedish stakeholders continue funding the participation in the Halden Reactor Project. Additionally, the Swedish authority’s funding of research infrastructures in general should be safeguarded by acknowledging this type of investment in the research strategy. The distinct and fundamental role of research infrastructures in innovation systems is being increasingly recognized, and the participation in the Halden Reactor Project is a clear example of the value of such institutions for the continuous expansion of knowledge. Furthermore, the Swedish strategy for benefiting from the Halden Reactor Project should be further elaborated, taking into account the possible actions of strengthening coordination, increasing funding to supplementary domestic research, and reviewing the responsibilities of the officials administering the Swedish participation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} space-time optimizations of in-memory search engines. Search engines {{can answer}} queries quickly, {{but this is}} accomplished using significant resources {{in the form of}} multiple machines running concurrently. Improving the performance of search engines means reducing the resource costs, such as hardware, energy, and cooling. These saved resources can then be used to improve the effectiveness of the search engine or provide <b>additional</b> <b>added</b> value to the system. We improve the space-time performance for search engines in the context of in-memory conjunctive intersection of ordered document identifier lists. We show that reordering of document identifiers can produce dense regions in these lists, where bitvectors can be used to improve the efficiency of conjunctive list intersection. Since the process of list intersection is a fundamental building block and a major performance bottleneck for search engines, this work will be important for all search engine researchers and developers. Our results are presented in three stages. First, we show how to combine multiple existing techniques for list intersection to improve space-time performance. We combine bitvectors for large lists with skips over compressed values for the other lists. When the skips are large and overlaid on the compressed lists, space-time performance is superior to existing techniques, such as using skips or bitvectors separately. Second, we show that grouping documents by size and ordering by URL within groups combines the skewed clustering that results from document size ordering with the tight clustering that results from URL ordering. We propose a new semi-bitvector data structure that encodes the front of a list, including groups with large documents, as a bitvector {{and the rest of the}} list as skips over compressed values. This combination produces significant space-time performance gains on top of the gains from the first stage. Third, we show how partitioning by document size into separate indexes can also produce high density regions that can be exploited by bitvectors, resulting in benefits similar to grouping by document size within one index. This partitioning technique requires no modification of the intersection algorithms, and it is therefore broadly applicable. We further show that any of our partitioning approaches can be combined with semi-bitvectors and grouping within each partition to effectively exploit skewed clustering and tight clustering in our dataset. A hierarchy of partitioning approaches may be required to exploit clustering in very large document collections...|$|E
