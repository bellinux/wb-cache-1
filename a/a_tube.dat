50|$|<b>A</b> {{capillary}} <b>tube</b> mat is <b>a</b> flat {{composite structure}} of thin <b>tubes</b> (capillaries) with <b>a</b> distributor <b>tube</b> and <b>a</b> collector <b>tube.</b> The main applications include cooling ceilings (radiant cooling) and underfloor heating.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> test <b>tube</b> holder {{is used to}} hold Test Tubes. It is {{used for}} holding <b>a</b> test <b>tube</b> in place when the tube is hot or should not be touched. For example, <b>a</b> test <b>tube</b> holder {{can be used to}} hold <b>a</b> test <b>tube</b> while it is being heated. Moreover, when heating the tube with liquid or solid {{contained}} inside, the tube holder ought to tightly hold <b>a</b> test <b>tube</b> in order for the tube to be safely held while heating.|$|R

5|$|Dysphagia and dysarthria: {{dysphagia}} is {{a difficulty}} with eating and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor {{control over the}} subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A {{speech and language therapist}} may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is <b>a</b> <b>tube</b> that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing <b>a</b> <b>tube</b> into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results in the long term than nasogastric intake.|$|E
5000|$|Vacuum <b>tube</b> memory : <b>A</b> Williams <b>tube</b> used <b>a</b> {{cathode ray}} <b>tube,</b> and <b>a</b> Selectron <b>tube</b> used <b>a</b> large vacuum <b>tube</b> to store information. These primary storage devices were {{short-lived}} in the market, since Williams tube was unreliable and the Selectron tube was expensive.|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{advantages}} {{to be gained by}} replacing the conventional orifice of <b>a</b> pulse <b>tube</b> cooler by <b>an</b> inertance <b>tube</b> - <b>a</b> long thin <b>tube</b> that introduces the possibility for additional phase shift between pressure and mass flow in the pulse tube section. The case for the use of <b>an</b> inertance <b>tube</b> is most clearly made with an electrical analogy where the 'inductance' added by the inertance tube allows for optimal power transfer at the cold heat exchanger. Detailed modeling of <b>a</b> pulse <b>tube</b> system with <b>an</b> inertance <b>tube</b> confirms these advantages. Comparison between a laboratory cooler with an orifice and with <b>an</b> inertance <b>tube</b> will be presented and reasons wily it is difficult to realize all the expected gain will be given...|$|R

5|$|Liverpool Street {{was built}} as a dual-level station with {{provision}} for the Underground. <b>A</b> <b>tube</b> station opened in 1875 for the Metropolitan Railway, and the station today is served by the Central, Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines, and is in fare zone 1.|$|E
5|$|The Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B) was <b>a</b> <b>tube</b> railway {{company which}} had been {{purchased}} by the DR in 1898, but had remained a separate financial entity. It had permission to construct a line from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus, but had not raised the capital to do so. At South Kensington it was to connect to the deep level line planned by the DR. On 12 September 1901, the DR-controlled board of the B sold the company to the MDETC. In the same month, the B took over the Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN), <b>a</b> <b>tube</b> railway with permission to build a line from Strand to Finsbury Park. The routes of the B and GN were subsequently linked and combined with part of the DR's tube route to create the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP).|$|E
5|$|The District had {{permission}} for a deep-level tube beneath the sub-surface line between Earl's Court and Mansion House and in 1898 bought the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway with authority for <b>a</b> <b>tube</b> from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus. These plans were combined {{with those of}} the Great Northern and Strand Railway, <b>a</b> <b>tube</b> railway with permission to build a line from Strand to Wood Green, to create the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP). The section of the District's deep-level tube from South Kensington to Mansion house was dropped from plans. In April 1902, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) was established, with Yerkes as chairman, to control these companies and manage the planned works. On 8 June 1902, the UERL took over the Traction Company and paid off the company's shareholders with cash and UERL shares.|$|E

5|$|The left {{mandible}} is used {{briefly to}} cut into the food plant; saliva is injected and the maxillary stylets, which form <b>a</b> <b>tube,</b> are then inserted and the semi-digested food pumped from ruptured cells. This process leaves cells destroyed or collapsed, and a distinctive silvery or bronze scarring on the surfaces of the stems or leaves where the thrips have fed.|$|E
5|$|A {{parabolic}} trough {{consists of a}} linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is <b>a</b> <b>tube</b> positioned right above {{the middle of the}} parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology. The SEGS plants in California and Acciona's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City, Nevada are representatives of this technology.|$|E

5|$|A station {{here was}} part of the {{abandoned}} phase two expansion of the Fleet line (now Jubilee line). It had originally been planned in 1943, and was revived as a major transport plan in 1965. London Transport spent £10m (now £m) in 1972 safeguarding the route underneath Cannon Street and building reinforcements for laying <b>a</b> <b>tube</b> in the water-bearing ground around the station. The plan was abandoned in the early 1980s in favour of the current extension further south.|$|E
5|$|According to Bayliss, the dog {{had been}} given a {{morphine}} injection earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to <b>a</b> <b>tube</b> in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that {{the dog had}} been adequately anaesthetized. They said the dog had appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, {{and that there was no}} smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E
5|$|Bayliss's counsel, Rufus Isaacs, called Starling as {{his first}} witness. Starling {{admitted}} that he had broken the law by using the dog twice, but said that he had done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that the dog had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to <b>a</b> <b>tube</b> connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E

5|$|DX arrays {{have been}} made to form hollow {{nanotubes}} 4–20nm in diameter, essentially two-dimensional lattices which curve back upon themselves. These DNA nanotubes are somewhat similar in size and shape to carbon nanotubes, and while they lack the electrical conductance of carbon nanotubes, DNA nanotubes are more easily modified and connected to other structures. One of many schemes for constructing DNA nanotubes uses a lattice of curved DX tiles that curls around itself and closes into <b>a</b> <b>tube.</b> In an alternative method that allows the circumference to be specified in a simple, modular fashion using single-stranded tiles, the rigidity of the tube is an emergent property.|$|E
5|$|Decorative sword {{mountings}} of the kazari-tachi type {{carried on}} the tradition of ancient straight Chinese style tachi and were used by nobles at court ceremonies until the Muromachi period. They contained a very narrow crude unsharpened blade. Two mountain-shaped metal fittings were provided to attach the straps; the scabbard between was covered by <b>a</b> (<b>tube)</b> fitting. The hilt was covered with ray skin and the scabbard typically decorated in maki-e or mother of pearl.|$|E
5|$|In {{embryonic}} development, {{the lungs}} {{begin to develop}} as an outpouching of the foregut, <b>a</b> <b>tube</b> which goes on to form {{the upper part of}} the digestive system. When the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. At birth however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.|$|E
