2500|$|Peptide hormones have {{important}} influences upon the hypothalamus, {{and to do}} so they must pass through the blood–brain barrier. The hypothalamus is bounded in part by specialized brain regions that lack an effective blood–brain barrier; the capillary endothelium at these sites is fenestrated to allow free passage of even large proteins and other molecules. [...] Some of these sites are the sites of neurosecretion - the neurohypophysis and the median eminence. However, others are sites at which the brain samples the composition of the blood. Two of these sites, the SFO (subfornical organ) and the OVLT (organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis) are so-called circumventricular organs, where neurons are in intimate contact with both blood and CSF. These structures are densely vascularized, and contain osmoreceptive and sodium-receptive neurons that control drinking, vasopressin release, sodium excretion, and sodium appetite. They also contain neurons with receptors for angiotensin, <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>factor,</b> endothelin and relaxin, each of which important in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance.

We studied the haemodynamic (ultrasound Doppler flow probes) effects of synthetic atriopeptin II at natriuretic doses in conscious rats. Intravenous injections of atriopeptin II induced a marked, dose-dependent increase in sodium excretion. This was accompanied by a slight reduction in blood pressure (BP) and a transient decrease in renal, mesenteric and aortic blood flow. In contrast, a selective renal vasodilator, CGP 22, 979, induced a moderate increase in sodium excretion concomitantly with a rise in renal blood flow. Blood pressure and the other regional flows remained unchanged. These findings suggest that the natriuretic effect of CGP 22, 979 is closely related to an increased renal blood flow.

In general, these peptides, called <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>factors</b> (ANFs), oppose {{the actions of}} the water-conservatory peptides angiotensin II and vasopressin and are released from the heart in response to atrial stretch as a consequence of increased venous return. The recent description of ANF-like immunoreactivity in brain regions associated with the control of water intake suggested a role for these peptides in the neurogenic mechanisms of thirst. Intracerebroventricular (third ventricle) infusion of 1. 0 or 2. 0 nmol of ANF in conscious, overnight-dehydrated rats significantly inhibited subsequent water intake over a 2 -hr test period. Intravenous infusion of 2. 0 nmol, but not 1. 0 nmol, of ANF resulted in a similar inhibitory action, suggesting that ANF released from the heart might act centrally to inhibit water intake by an action at {{one or more of the}} circumventricular organs. Water intake induced by central infusion of angiotensin II (9. 6 and 25 pmol) in normally hydrated rats was significantly inhibited by prior infusion of 2. 0 nmol of ANF. Water intake induced by higher doses of angiotensin II was not altered significantly by prior infusion of ANF. These results indicate a possible physiologic role for ANF in the hypothalamic control of water intake and reveal that the cardiac peptides can act centrally, as well as peripherally, to assist in the normalization of extracellular fluid volume...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the renin-angiotensin system and <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>factors</b> (ANF) two {{hormonal}} systems which are stimulated and which may exert important antagonizing actions on the regulation of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and body fluid homeostasis during pregnancy. All experiments were conducted in healthy nonpregnant and/or pregnant (gestational age of 105 to 140 days, term = 145 days) mixed breed ewes, using a facility designed for studies of large animals. Findings from the first study with unilateral denervated kidneys provide evidence that renal nerves are a necessary component in the control of renin secretion in both nonpregnant and pregnant ewes. The second study demonstrates that angiotensin II (AngII) and ANF do {{not account for the}} dramatic suppression of renin secretion in response to the reduction of renal perfusion pressure in sheep with bilateral renal denervation. The data from these two studies suggest that the renal baroreceptors influence renin secretion indirectly through activation of renal afferents rather than by a direct action on the juxtaglomerular apparatus. In order to study the possible effects of increased plasma AngII on ANF production during pregnancy, four doses of AngII (0. 5, 5, 20, 40 ng/kg/min) and nitroprusside were simultaneously infused to separate indirect hemodynamic actions on ANF secretion from direct hormonally mediated effects on ANF secretion by AngII. The data clearly show that AngII increases plasma ANF in a dose-dependent manner but: only {{in the presence of the}} AngII pressor effect. A striking finding was the demonstration that the natriuretic and diuretic responses to intrarenal artery infusion of three doses of ANF (0. 3, 1. 5, 3. 0 pmol/kg/min) are increased during ovine pregnancy and these responses are solely limited to actions on the distal part of the nephron without altering renal vascular or glomerular function.

Alpha-atrial <b>natriuretic</b> <b>factor</b> levels were determined by a radioimmunoassay on blood samples from the inferior vena cava, right atrium, pulmonary artery, left atrium and aorta.

After right ventriculography, a 100 % to 200 % increase of alpha-atrial <b>natriuretic</b> <b>factor</b> was observed in the total sample (p < 0. 001).

Clinical and epidemiological studies have provided strong evidence for genetic influences in the development of human stroke and several mendelian traits featuring stroke have been described. The genetic analysis of the non-mendelian, common ischaemic stroke in humans is hindered by the late onset of the disease and the mode of inheritance, which is complex, polygenic and multifactorial. An important approach to the study of such polygenic diseases is the use of appropriate animal models in which individual contributing factors can be recognized and analysed. The spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat (SHRSP) is an experimental model of stroke characterized by a high frequency of spontaneous strokes as well as an increased sensitivity to experimentally induced focal cerebral ischaemia.

Despite the absence of polyuria in all but two patients in this study atrial peptides could still contribute to, or cause, the polyuria of tachycardias...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{relation}} between <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> peptide and ventricular dysfunction, we simulta-neously measured both atrial and plasma immunoreactive <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> peptide concentrations in rats 4 weeks after myocardial infarction induced by left coronary artery ligation. When compared to controls (n = 39), rats with infarction (n = 16) had markedly elevated plasma immunoreactive <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> peptide concentrations (1205. 8 ± 180. 9 vs. 126. 7 ± 8. 9 pg/ml, p < 0. 001) and reduced immunoreactive <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> peptide concentrations in right and left atria (31. 4 ± 4. 6 vs. 61. 2 ± 3. 2 ng/mg,p< 0. 001; 14. 9 ± 2. 2 vs. 32. 7 ± 2. 4 ng/mg,p< 0. 001, respectively). Right ventricu-lar weight increased in proportion to infarct size, and both were correlated with plasma immunoreac-tive <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> peptide levels (r = 0. 825, p < 0. 001 and r = 0. 816, p< 0. 001, respectively). Right <b>atrial</b> immunoreactive <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> peptide content {{was significantly higher than}} left in both controls and rats with infarction. Both right and left <b>atrial</b> immunoreactive <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> peptide concentrations were negatively correlated with both right ventricular weight as well as plasma im-munoreactive <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> peptide concentrations (right atrium: r =- 0. 816, p< 0. 001, r =- 0. 708, p< 0. 01; left atrium: r =- 0. 687, p< 0. 01, r =- 0. 644, p< 0. 01, respectively). These re-sults suggest that chronic stimulation of <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> peptide release from both atria is associated with increased turnover and depleted stores of <b>atrial</b> <b>natriuretic</b> peptide in atria in proportion to th...|$|R
