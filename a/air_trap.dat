40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the test performance and longitudinal evolution of <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> for diagnosing bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over 7 years, 111 combined inspiratory and expiratory computed tomographic examinations were performed in eight healthy control subjects and 38 heart-lung transplant recipients. Functional impairment was assessed with the BOS classification. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) {{analysis was performed}} to {{determine the}} optimal threshold of <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> to distinguish between patients with and those without BOS and to compute sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing BOS. RESULTS: The extent of <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> increased with BOS severity (P =. 001). A threshold of 32 % of <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> is optimal for distinguishing between patients with and those without BOS and provides a sensitivity of 83 %, a specificity of 89 %, and an accuracy of 88 %. The prevalence of BOS and positive predictive value of <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> increased with postoperative time, but the negative predictive value of <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> remained high throughout the study. Patients without BOS who had <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> exceeding 32 % of the parenchyma were at significantly increased risk of developing BOS (P =. 004). CONCLUSION: At the threshold of 32 %, <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> is sensitive, specific, and accurate for diagnosing BOS.

40|$|Rationale: Mustard gas {{primarily}} affects the eyes, skin, {{and particularly the}} respiratory tract. Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) and <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> are often observed in high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) scans of the chest of mustard gas–exposed patients. Objectives: To examine the frequency and severity of TBM {{in a group of}} Iranian wartime mustard gas–exposed victims, and to investigate the correlation between TBM and <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> in these cases. Materials and Methods: Chest HRCT films obtained from 300 randomly selected subjects who had been exposed to mustard gas 15. 5 yr previously were reviewed to determine the existence of TBM and <b>air</b> <b>trapping.</b> The HRCT films of a healthy control group were also analyzed for comparison. Results: Out of 300 reviewed cases, 13 had TBM. From these 13 TBM cases, 11 (85 %) showed <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> with mean score of 5. 5. In the control group, 5 (25 %) of 20 subjects showed <b>air</b> <b>trapping,</b> with mean score of 0. 6. The total <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> was significantly higher in the TBM group (p � 0. 001). There was an association between the severity of tracheomalacia and <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> in the TBM group (p � 0. 01, r � 0. 69), but no association was observed between severity of bronchomalacia and <b>air</b> <b>trapping.</b> Conclusion: The results show that <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> and TBM are correlated, both as long-term sequelae in mustard gas–exposed cases. Because <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> is highly suggestive of bronchiolitis obliterans, we conclude that both bronchiolitis obliterans and TBM are caused by a single underlying process affecting small and large airways, respectively, in this group of patients...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the intrapatient reproducibility {{of the extent}} and anatomic distribution of <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> at sequential expiratory thin-section computed tomographic (CT) examinations in heart-lung transplant recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen heart-lung transplant recipients (eight with and 11 without bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [BOS]) underwent three expiratory CT examinations within 1 hour. Residual volumes were measured at CT. Anatomic distribution and extent of <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> were scored by two observers at two independent readings, and the reproducibility of observations was calculated for each feature. CT examination results were compared by using {{an analysis of variance}} that took into account interobserver and BOS and non-BOS effects. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated to test the association between variability of residual volumes and variability of the extent of <b>air</b> <b>trapping.</b> RESULTS: Residual volumes did not significantly differ between the three CT examinations (P =. 556). Reproducibility values for findings of anatomic distribution of <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> ranged from 84 % to 95 %, with a tendency toward improved reproducibility in patients without BOS. Mean reproducibility values for the extent of <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> ranged from 97. 1 % to 97. 7 %, and no substantial difference in these values between patients with and those without BOS was observed.

METHODS: Inspiratory and expiratory chest CTs of 75 patients (37 male, 38 female; mean age 64. 0 +/- 5. 7 years) were reconstructed using FBP and IR. CT emphysema, CT <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> and airway dimensions of a segmental bronchus were quantified using several commonly used quantification methods. The two algorithms were compared using the concordance correlation coefficient (p (c)) and Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: Only the E/I-ratio(MLD) as a measure of CT <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> and airway dimensions showed {{no significant differences between the}} algorithms, whereas all CT emphysema and the other CT <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> measures were significantly different at IR when compared to FBP (P < 0. 001).

Hygrometric and thermic measurements have been recorded to assess the microclimatology of some Guadeloupean caves. The results from Blanchard Cave and Morne Rita Cave, two Pre-columbian archeological sites, are presented here. Recordings have been conducted according to two modes: a short-step one which defines the daily cycle, and a long-term one which documents the annual cycle. Measurements show two distinct patterns: 1. The first cave records temperatures globally warmer than the exterior conditions. But the regime is very unstable due to air currents bringing cold air deep into the cave. The result is a limited hygrometry and a very high sensitivity to daily hygro-thermic variations. Annual data collection reveals fluctuations in the hot <b>air</b> <b>trap</b> system, that we link {{to the influence of}} seasonal cloud covering. 2. The second cave can be considered as a cold <b>air</b> <b>trap.</b> Lack of air currents helps to establish a more stable system, and a more humid air to be maintained in the cavity. Daily fluctuations are strongly weakened. However, seasonnal variations are still recorded. These data open up prospects for further understanding of physical processes occurring in these sites. Thus, air flows that have been highlighted in the first site can explain the presence of evaporitic minerals in the ancient deposits by seaspray transported into the cave with cold air flows. Highlighting this supply also support the assumption that salt fretting contributes heavily to wall desegregation. A 0. 6 cm/century weathering rate is thus estimated from sedimentation age model.

The part, Cable tie selected from we idea to study of relationship material, locating gate {{and type of}} mould {{can be used in}} this project. This project intends to review the major problems encountered on the existing product and propose possible solution to make the product more viable and competitive. The investigation scope will also include material selection, as it has been identified as one of major problems uncounted on the existing product. Beside that, in this study a simulation of flow analysis (Moldflow) has been utilised to investigate filling image, temperature reaction, weld lines and <b>air</b> <b>trap</b> phenomena in cooperating the new mould design. In simulation of flow analysis (Moldflow) we also study on best selected locating gate. From the result we can do analysis and compared with the other results use different locating gate...|$|E
40|$|SummaryChronic {{persistent}} airway obstruction {{has been}} observed in moderate-to-severe asthmatics despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. We investigated which airway changes were associated with this obstruction. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed at study entry and reexamined {{at the time of}} follow-up when the FEV 1 reached a maximally constant level after treatment for 1 year or more with inhaled corticosteroids. Bronchial wall area and <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> extent were compared in the recovered group (n =  18) and the persistent airway obstruction group (n =  14). Bronchial wall area and <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> of the initial HRCT were similar between the two groups. On follow-up HRCT, <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> was markedly decreased in the recovered group compared with that on initial HRCT (P =  0. 017), whereas bronchial wall area did not change. In the persistent-airway-obstruction group, these two parameters did not change during follow-up. When follow-up HRCT was compared, <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> was significantly greater in the persistent-airway-obstruction group than in the recovered group (P =  0. 003). Difference post-bronchodilator FEV 1 value between at initial and 2 nd HRCT exam was correlated with difference <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> value between at initial and 2 nd HRCT exam(%) on the follow-up HRCT (P =  0. 017). The presence of persistent airflow obstruction were significantly associated with the <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> % difference between initial and 2 nd time (RR =  1. 70, P =  0. 018). Persistence of AT could be a main contributing factor to chronic persistent airflow obstruction in asthma...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND : Lung cancer {{screening}} CT scans might provide valuable information about <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> {{as an early}} indicator of smoking-related lung disease. We studied which of the currently suggested measures is most suitable for detecting functionally relevant <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> on low-dose computed tomography (CT) in a population of subjects with early-stage disease. METHODS : This study was ethically approved and informed consent was obtained. Three quantitative CT <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> measures were compared against a functional reference standard in 427 male lung {{cancer screening}} participants. This reference standard for <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> {{was derived from the}} residual volume over total lung capacity ratio (RV/TLC) beyond the 95 th percentile of predicted. The following CT <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> measures were compared: expiratory to inspiratory relative volume change of voxels with attenuation values between - 860 and - 950 Hounsfield Units (RVC(- 860 to - 950)), expiratory to inspiratory ratio of mean lung density (E/I-ratio(MLD)) and percentage of voxels below - 856 HU in expiration (EXP(- 856)). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed and area under the ROC curve compared. RESULTS: Functionally relevant <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> was present in 38 (8. 9 %) participants. E/I-ratio(MLD) showed the largest area under the curve (0. 85, 95 % CI 0. 813 - 0. 883), which was significantly larger than RVC(- 860 to - 950) (0. 703, 0. 657 - 0. 746; p < 0. 001) and EXP(- 856) (0. 798, 0. 757 - 0. 835; p = 0. 002). At the optimum for sensitivity and specificity, E/I-ratio(MLD) yielded an accuracy of 81. 5 %. CONCLUSIONS: The expiratory to inspiratory ratio of mean lung density (E/I-ratio(MLD)) is most suitable for detecting <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> on low-dose screening CT and performs significantly better than other suggested quantitative measures...|$|R
