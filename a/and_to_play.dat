5|$|Wilt Chamberlain {{received}} {{criticism for}} {{his inability to}} win lead Kansas to a win in the National Championship game; Chamberlain later admitted that this loss was the most painful in his life. He returned to Kansas for his junior year <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> another season under coach Dick Harp. Chamberlain quickly became frustrated with the opposing teams' way of playing him, which primarily consisted of double or triple teaming Chamberlain in order to limit his offensive production and effectiveness. In addition, many teams resorted to running out {{the time on the}} clock when in the lead against the Jayhawks to increase their odds of winning the game. After the Jayhawks failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament that year, Chamberlain decided to forgo his senior season to play with the Harlem Globetrotters. He did not return to Kansas' campus for over 40 years after leaving for the Globetrotters; he finally returned in 1998, the year before his death, when his jersey was retired.|$|E

Since d > b and d-b < a+d-b-c, p is always between zero and one, so existence is assured (similarly for q).|$|R

25|$|Voicemail is the {{managing}} of telephone messages from a centralized data storing system. Voicemail is stored on hard disk drives, media generally used by computers {{in order to}} store other forms of data.

25|$|The lessons, {{especially}} those of Constantin Heger, were very much appreciated by Charlotte, and the two sisters showed exceptional intelligence, although Emily hardly liked her teacher and was somewhat rebellious. Emily learned German <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the piano with natural brilliance and very quickly the two sisters were writing literary and philosophical essays in an advanced level of French. After six months of study, Mme Heger suggested they stay at the boarding school free of charge, in return for giving some lessons. After much hesitation, the girls accepted. Neither of them felt particularly attached to their students, and only one, Mademoiselle de Bassompierre, then aged 16, later expressed any affection for her teacher, which in Emily's case appeared to be mutual, and made her a gift of a signed, detailed drawing of a storm ravaged pine tree.|$|E
