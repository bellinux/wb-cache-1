5|$|Some reviewers {{praised the}} new laptop's {{performance}} and compact size, {{the quality of}} the screen, <b>and</b> <b>sturdy</b> unibody build, which allowed easier upgrading of internal components as compared to the original models. Some reviewers also noted that the new MacBook Pro ran more quietly and at cooler temperatures than first generation machines. Others, however, criticized the amount of heat generated by the new design.|$|E
5|$|The Air Gates play a {{vital role}} in the Red Bull Air Race, but must also fulfill complex and {{contradictory}} demands. They have to be delicate enough to burst apart the instant they are touched by an aircraft <b>and</b> <b>sturdy</b> enough to remain stationary in all weather conditions, including stormy weather and strong winds. The early cylindrical pylons fulfilled the first criterion but proved to be too unstable in the wind.|$|E
5|$|The baggage camel {{should be}} robust and heavy. Studies have {{recommended}} the camel should have either a small {{or a large}} head with a narrow aquiline nose, prominent eyes and large lips. The neck should be medium to long so the head is held high. The chest should be deep and the hump should be well-developed with sufficient space behind it to accommodate the saddle. The hindlegs should be heavy, muscular <b>and</b> <b>sturdy.</b> The dromedary can be trained to carry baggage {{from the age of}} five years, but must not be given heavy loads before the age of six. The hawia is a typical baggage saddle from Sudan. The methods of training the baggage camels are similar to those for riding camels.|$|E

5|$|The {{iconography}} of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti {{was influenced by}} Gandhara architectural tradition, which impacted the iconographic depictions of sculptures of Northwest India, particularly those made in Kashmir. Keeping with the Gandhara style, the body and legs are depicted as strong <b>and</b> <b>sturdy.</b> The muscular body {{is considered to be}} inflated with prana (life-breath), an Indian concept. The bow arched eyebrows and lotus shaped eyes are also characteristic of the Indian school of sculpture. The presence of the earth goddess at the feet also reflects Central Asian influence. The ayudhapurushas in the icon may be inspired by those in the Vishnu {{iconography of}} Gupta art. They and the earth goddess are also part of traditional Vishnu iconography, even when he is depicted as one-headed.|$|E

25|$|Many {{of the old}} {{churches in}} today's Scanian {{landscape}} stem from the medieval age, although many church renovations, extensions and destruction of older buildings {{took place in the}} 16th and 19th century. From those that have kept features of the authentic style, it is still possible to see how the medieval, Romanesque or Renaissance churches of Danish Scania looked like. Many Scanian churches have distinctive crow-stepped gables <b>and</b> <b>sturdy</b> church porches, usually made of stone.|$|E
25|$|The general {{appearance}} of the Sheltie {{is that of a}} miniature Rough Collie. They are a small, double coated, working dog, agile <b>and</b> <b>sturdy.</b> Blue merle Shelties may have blue eyes or one brown and one blue eye, but all others have dark colored eyes. Their expression should be that of alertness with a gentle and sometimes reserved nature. They are often very good with children. They carry their tail down low, only lifted when alert and never carried over the back. They are an intensely loyal breed, sometimes reserved with strangers but should not be shy or showing timidness as per the AKC breed standard.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the 1960s saw {{the release of the}} Moskvitch 408, intended to be an economy car that would spread the use of cars among the population. Other manufacturers such as MZMA, GAZ and ZAZ were offering a variety of cars intended for the mass market. The Soviet government opted to build an even larger car manufacturing plant that would produce a people's car and help to meet the demand for personal transport. For reasons of cost-efficiency, it was decided to produce the car on the basis of an existing, modern foreign model. After considering several options, the Fiat 124 was chosen because of its simple <b>and</b> <b>sturdy</b> design, being easy to manufacture and repair.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} type of sea rods are for surf casting. Surf casting rods {{resemble}} oversized spinning or bait casting rods with long grip handles intended for two-handed casting techniques. Generally between 10 and 14 feet (3–4m) in length, surf casting rods need to be longer in order for the user cast the lure or bait beyond the breaking surf where fish tend to congregate, <b>and</b> <b>sturdy</b> enough to cast heavy weighted lures or bait needed to hold the bottom in rough water. They are almost always used in shore fishing (sea fishing from the shoreline) from the beach, rocks or other shore feature. Some surfcasters use powerful rods to cast up to six ounces or more of lead weight, artificial lures, and/or bait over one hundred yards.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1951, due to the {{perceived}} superiority of the MiGs in air combat– {{as well as the}} Meteor's favourable low-level performance <b>and</b> <b>sturdy</b> construction, RAAF commanders had 77 Squadron reassigned to ground-attack duties. In February 1952, more than a thousand sorties were flown in the ground-attack role; these sorties continued until May 1952, when 77 Squadron switched to fighter sweep operations. The last encounter between the Meteor and the MiG-15 was in March 1953, during which a Meteor piloted by Sergeant John Hale recorded a victory. By the end of the conflict, the squadron had flown 4,836 missions, destroying six MiG-15s, over 3,500 structures and some 1,500 vehicles. About 30 Meteors were lost to enemy action in Korea, the vast majority shot down by anti-aircraft fire while serving in a ground-attack capacity.|$|E
25|$|In 1967 Vactec {{introduced}} a compact RO branded as Vactrol. Unlike the tube-coupled ROs of Fender and Gibson, Vactrols were sealed <b>and</b> <b>sturdy</b> devices. In the early 1970s, Vactec replaced incandescent bulbs by LEDs. This increased the switching speed, {{but not to}} the level required for digital devices. Therefore, the introduction of the faster photodiodes and phototransistors in the 1970s pushed out ROs from the market. ROs retained narrow application niches in sound equipment and some industrial automation devices that did not require high speeds. Vactec did not extend their rights to the trademark Vactrol, and it has become a household word in the English language for any RO used in audio equipment, including the ROs of Fender and Gibson. As of 2012, the Vactrol ROs were produced by PerkinElmer, the successor Vactec.|$|E

25|$|In {{both males}} and females the legs are short <b>and</b> <b>sturdy,</b> with an {{enlarged}} tarsomere on the first pair, containing the silk-producing glands. The abdomen has ten segments, with a pair of cerci on the final segment. These cerci are highly sensitive to touch, and allow the animal to navigate while moving backwards through the gallery tunnels, which are too narrow to allow the insect to turn round. Because morphology is so similar between species, it makes species identification extremely difficult. For this reason, the main form of taxonomic identification used in the past has been close observation of distinctive copulatory structures of males, (although this method is now thought by some entomologists and taxonomists as giving insufficient classification detail). Although males never eat during their adult stage, they do have mouthparts similar to the females. These mouthparts are used to hold onto the female during copulation.|$|E

Richard Lister in the New Statesman thought that [...] "Mr. Fleming is splendid; he stops at nothing."

500|$|A {{short and}} stocky limb {{structure}} makes the jaguar adept at climbing, crawling, and swimming. The head is robust and the jaw extremely powerful, {{it has the}} third highest bite force of all felids, after the tiger and lion. A 100kg (220lb) jaguar can bite with a force of 503.6 kgf (1110lbf) at canine teeth and 705.8 kgf (1556lbf) at carnassial notch. This strength adaptation allows the jaguar to pierce turtle shells. A comparative study of bite force adjusted for body size ranked it as the top felid, alongside the clouded leopard and ahead of the tiger and lion. It {{has been reported that}} [...] "an individual jaguar can drag an [...] bull [...] in its jaws and pulverize the heaviest bones". The jaguar hunts wild animals weighing up to 300kg (660lb) in dense jungle, and its short <b>and</b> <b>sturdy</b> physique is thus an adaptation to its prey and environment.|$|E
