5|$|A Portrait of the <b>Artist</b> <b>as</b> a Young Man is {{a nearly}} {{complete}} rewrite {{of the abandoned}} novel Stephen Hero. Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript {{in a fit of}} rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A Künstlerroman, Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.|$|E

Beck and Coldplay have each received the award twice, the latter being the only group to win two years consecutively. American artists have been presented with the award more than any other nationality, though it has been presented to musicians or groups from the United Kingdom five times, from Ireland twice, and from France once.|$|E

The pieces on view in Hard Truths cover a range {{of social and political}} themes, many of which address rural life in the south and the treatment of African Americans. After departing Indianapolis, the exhibition is scheduled to travel to New Orleans, Charlotte, North Carolina and Atlanta.|$|E

5|$|Higgins' {{lifestyle}} was {{varied in}} interests and occupations. Along with {{working as a}} wildcatter, his diverse activities involved drafting, work as an inventor, an <b>artist,</b> <b>as</b> well as an engineer to name a few. His religious beliefs kept him away from public entertainment and resorts, as well as maintaining a strong belief against the selling of alcohol. In addition to residing in Beaumont, he owned estates in Houston and San Antonio. He remained a bachelor {{until the age of}} 45. In 1905, he adopted a young woman named Annie Jahn, who at the time was fifteen. Three years later Higgins married her, and later had three children with her, despite the scandal. Higgins died in San Antonio on June 5, 1955.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 The Map of Love {{appeared}} {{as a collection of}} 16 poems and seven of the 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934. Ten stories in his next book, Portrait of the <b>Artist</b> <b>as</b> a Young Dog (1940), were based less on lavish fantasy than The Map of Love and more on real-life romances featuring himself in Wales. Sales of both books were poor, resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees from writing and reviewing. At this time he borrowed heavily from friends and acquaintances. Hounded by creditors, Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 and moved to the home of critic John Davenport in Marshfield, Gloucestershire. There Thomas collaborated with Davenport on the satire The Death of the King's Canary, though due to fears of libel the work was not published until 1976.|$|E
5|$|In the mid- to late 1970s Kujau, an able amateur artist, {{turned to}} {{producing}} paintings which he claimed were by Hitler, {{who had been}} an amateur <b>artist</b> <b>as</b> a young man. Having found a market for his forged works, Kujau created Hitler paintings depicting subjects his buyers expressed interest in, such as cartoons, nudes and men in action—all subjects that Hitler never painted, or would want to paint, according to Charles Hamilton, a handwriting expert and author of books on forgery. These paintings were often accompanied by small notes, purportedly from Hitler. The paintings were profitable for Kujau. To explain his access to the memorabilia he invented several sources in East Germany, including a former Nazi general, the bribable director of a museum and his own brother, who he re-invented as a general in the East German army.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1960s, the Nasution {{siblings}} {{formed a}} band; Chrisye and Joris watched them play songs by Uriah Heep and Blood, Sweat & Tears. In 1968 Chrisye registered at the Christian University of Indonesia (UKI) {{to fulfill his}} father's wish that he become an engineer. Around 1969, however, Gauri invited him to join the Nasutions' band, Sabda Nada, {{as a replacement for}} their bassist Eddi Odek who was ill. Pleased with his performance, the Nasutions asked him to stay as a permanent member. The group had a regular gig at Mini Disko on Juanda Street and freelanced at birthday and wedding parties. When Chrisye had a chance to sing while performing covers, he attempted to sound as much like the original <b>artist</b> <b>as</b> he could.|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 1904 Joyce {{attempted}} to publish A Portrait of the Artist, an essay-story dealing with aesthetics, {{only to have}} it rejected by the free-thinking magazine Dana. He decided, on his twenty-second birthday, to revise the story into a novel he called Stephen Hero. It was a fictional rendering of Joyce's youth, but he eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned this work. It was never published in this form, but years later, in Trieste, Joyce completely rewrote it as A Portrait of the <b>Artist</b> <b>as</b> a Young Man. The unfinished Stephen Hero was published after his death.|$|E
5|$|Rakoto's {{opportunity}} for national fame arrived with the 1958 visit of French President Charles de Gaulle to Madagascar. The visit was {{in conjunction with}} the dissolution of colonial status and naming of Philibert Tsiranana as Prime Minister, part of the island's transition to full independence in 1960. Tsiranana had previously seen the flutist perform and invited Rakoto and his group of 18musicians to accompany de Gaulle and perform traditional pieces during a portion of the French statesman's walking tour through the capital city of Antananarivo. Following this performance, Rakoto dedicated himself full-time to a career in music, performing regularly at traditional celebrations on the island. Tsiranana, who became president of Madagascar two years later, was the first to refer to the <b>artist</b> <b>as</b> Rakoto Frah, the name that the musician would use {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E

5|$|The Arnolfini {{is named}} after Jan van Eyck's {{masterpiece}} The Arnolfini Portrait (1434) depicting the merchant and arts patron Giovanni Arnolfini. The Arnolfini Portrait {{is one of the}} earliest paintings to assert the presence of the artist within its depiction (an inscription {{in the middle of the}} work and a reflection in a mirror on the back wall) and one of Arnolfini's consistent concerns: to explore the role of <b>artist</b> <b>as</b> a witness and recorder of what is around them – contemporary society. The painting is in the National Gallery, London and it was one of the founder's favourite paintings.|$|E
5|$|The {{imperial}} {{courts of}} the emperor's palace {{were filled with}} his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. Emperor Huizong was a renowned <b>artist</b> <b>as</b> well as a patron of the arts. A prime example of a highly venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177). This art project was a diplomatic gesture to the Jin dynasty while he negotiated {{for the release of}} his mother from Jurchen captivity in the north.|$|E
5|$|Thomas was an {{accomplished}} writer of prose poetry, with collections such as Portrait of the <b>Artist</b> <b>as</b> a Young Dog (1940) and Quite Early One Morning (1954) showing {{he was capable}} of writing moving short stories. His first published prose work was After the Fair, printed in The New English Weekly on 15 March 1934. Jacob Korg believes that Thomas's fiction work can be classified into two main bodies, vigorous fantasies in a poetic style and, after 1939, more straightforward narratives. Korg surmises that Thomas approached his prose writing as an alternate poetic form, which allowed him to produce complex, involuted narratives that do not allow the reader to rest.|$|E

5|$|During the {{development}} of the first installment in the series, Square's management decided to manufacture 400,000 copies of the game to make a sequel possible. As there were no concrete ideas for Final Fantasy II from the start, it was eventually taken in a new direction and included none of the previous game's characters or locations. Hironobu Sakaguchi, who had previously served as the main planner for Final Fantasy, assumed the role of director to accommodate for the larger development team. Using the experience gained from the first installment, which focused more on fitting story ideas into their new gameplay system and game world, the developers fully crafted the story of Final Fantasy II first. The gameplay was then built around the narrative. The experience system was designed to be a more realistic advancement system than that of the first game. Several members of the original staff from the first game reprised their jobs for Final Fantasy II. Sakaguchi again created the plot for the title, with the actual scenario written by Kenji Terada. Nobuo Uematsu composed the music, as he had for the first game, while Yoshitaka Amano was again the concept <b>artist.</b> <b>As</b> with the original, Final Fantasy II was programmed by Nasir Gebelli. Midway through {{the development}} of the game, Gebelli was forced to return to Sacramento, California from Japan due to an expired work visa. The rest of the development staff followed him to Sacramento with necessary materials and equipment and finished production of the game there. The game was released one day {{less than a year after}} the first game came out.|$|E

The record spent a total of fifty-one weeks in the chart, and was certified gold by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP), signifying shipments of 100,000 copies. Eight months after its release in Europe, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) certified The Emancipation of Mimi platinum, denoting shipments of onemillion units throughout the continent. In Hong Kong it was awarded a Gold Disc Award, which is issued to the ten best-selling foreign albums each year. The Emancipation of Mimi debuted at number two on the Japanese Albums Chart, and was certified platinum (250,000 units shipped) by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). At the end of 2005, the IFPI reported that The Emancipation of Mimi had sold 7.7million copies globally, and was the second best-selling album of the year, after Coldplay's X. It was the best-selling album by a solo and female <b>artist.</b> <b>As</b> of today, The Emancipation of Mimi has sold 12 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In the {{opinions}} then current at the Royal Academy and among critics, {{the most prestigious}} form of painting was considered history painting, in which an artwork illustrated a story. It was thought that such works enabled British artists to show themselves as equal or even superior to those European artists active at the time, {{as well as to}} the Old Masters. Other forms of painting such as portraiture and landscapes were considered lesser styles, as they did not give the <b>artist</b> <b>as</b> much opportunity to illustrate a story but instead were simply depictions of reality. Nonetheless, even the most eminent artists would often devote time to portrait painting, as portraits were generally commissioned by the subjects or their families, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist; two of the first three presidents of the Royal Academy (Joshua Reynolds and Sir Thomas Lawrence) had made their names as portrait painters. Owing to a lack of patrons willing to commission history paintings, by the early 19th century history painting in England was in serious decline.|$|E
