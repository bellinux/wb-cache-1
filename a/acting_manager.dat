He was replaced by Tom Lockie, who carried on until after the 1945–46 FA Cup, when Mitchell returned for the 1946–47 Football League season. Mitchell resigned in February 1950 to concentrate on his business interests, and was succeeded in April by Birmingham City northern scout and former York player Dick Duckworth.

George Sherrill gave up what would be the winning run as the Dodgers lost their sixth straight, 7–5.

The Dodgers won 5–0 as Ramírez drove in 3 runs against his former team. Shane Victorino homered and drove in 3 runs to lead the Dodgers to a 5–4 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 13.
