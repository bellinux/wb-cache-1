5|$|The {{batteries}} in OR–7's Global Positioning System tracking unit expired in October 2015. Officials decided {{to replace the}} collar {{in order to keep}} track of the pack, which is protected under Oregon law and the federal Endangered Species Act. However, attempts to trap OR-7 or other members of the pack failed, and further tracking of OR-7 depended on trail cameras and live sightings. A trail camera in the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest captured an image of OR-7 and one of his offspring in early 2016. After four steers were killed by wolves in Wood River Valley in western Klamath County (immediately east of Jackson County) near where OR–7 was last seen, biologists said efforts to trap and re-collar the wolf would likely resume and that tracking could alert ranchers concerned about their livestock. On October 3, 2017, biologists caught and collared OR-54, another Rogue Pack wolf, thought to be OR-7's daughter, traveling with the pack in Wood River Valley. In lieu of another tracking device on OR-7, the collar on OR-54 will allow officials to track the movements <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> the pack.|$|E

25|$|Charles {{approached}} stuttering {{from the}} viewpoint that the stutterer should scrutinize his stuttering behavior, {{to become aware of}} everything he did from anticipation of stuttering, to struggling during a block, and to the utterance of the word. A speech-language clinician using his methodology was to explain to her client the nature of the many attitudes <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> stutterers. Wendell Johnson, a member of the same graduate program in Iowa who also became renowned for his work in the field of stuttering, said that Charles Van Riper's methodology was hard work. As a clinician, Charles was known for being warm and sympathetic, but tough on adult stutterers who refused to work and cooperate with him, since they were expected to be able and willing to practice behaviors and attitudes that would minimize their stuttering.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Faulkner {{found his}} niche within NLP {{when he began}} {{developing}} decision-making strategy models based on the thought-patterns <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> highly successful people. He mapped strategies for physicians, international negotiators and accelerated learners. He began to take a particular interest in studying the behavior of top traders in 1987 when a bond trader asked him if NLP {{could be used in}} the stock market. In 1990 after years of observing the decision-making strategies of successful traders such as Richard Dennis, Pete Steidlmayer, Jim Rogers, Paul Tudor Jones and Tom Baldwin, Faulkner decided to become a trader, himself. His first trade in 1992 was a failure; however, he did succeed in closing the year at a profit. Within three years, Faulkner's trading skills had improved enough that, author, Jack D. Schwager included his profile in The New Market Wizards: Conversations with America's Top Traders.|$|E
25|$|Often, {{archaeology}} {{provides the}} only means to learn of the existence <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of people {{have come and gone}} of which {{there is little or no}} written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete. Writing as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations. In contrast, Homo sapiens has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of Homo for millions of years (see Human evolution). These civilizations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization – the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities – must come from archaeology.|$|E

25|$|Schizophrenic patients' {{deficit in}} theory of mind impairs their daily {{interactions}} with others. An {{example of a}} disrupted interaction is one between a schizophrenic parent and a child. Theory of mind is particularly important for parents, who must understand the thoughts <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> their children and react accordingly. Dysfunctional parenting is associated with deficits in the first-order theory of mind, the ability to understand another person's thoughts, and the second-order theory of mind, the ability to infer what one person thinks about another person's thoughts. Compared with healthy mothers, mothers with schizophrenia {{are found to be}} more remote, quiet, self-absorbed, insensitive, unresponsive, and to have fewer satisfying interactions with their children. They also tend to misinterpret their children's emotional cues, and often misunderstand neutral faces as negative. Activities such as role-playing and individual or group-based sessions are effective interventions that help the parents improve on perspective-taking and theory of mind. Although there is a strong association between theory of mind deficit and parental role dysfunction, future studies could strengthen the relationship by possibly establishing a causal role of theory of mind on parenting abilities.|$|E
500|$|Jackson saw King Kong as {{opportunity}} for technical innovations in motion capture, commissioning Christian Rivers of Weta Digital to supervise {{all aspects of}} Kong's performance. Jackson decided early on {{that he did not}} want Kong to behave like a human, and so he and his team studied hours of gorilla footage. Serkis was cast in the title role in April 2003 and prepared himself by working with gorillas at the London Zoo. He then traveled to Rwanda, observing the actions <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> gorillas in the wild. Rivers explained that the detailed facial performance capture with Serkis was accomplished because of the similarities between human and gorilla faces. [...] "Gorillas have such a similar looking set of eyes and brows, you can look at those expressions and transpose your own interpretation onto them." [...] Photos of silverback gorillas were also superimposed on Kong's image in the early stages of animation. Serkis had to go through two hours of motion capture makeup every day, having 135 small markers attached to different spots on his face. Following principal photography, Serkis had to spend an additional two months on a motion capture stage, miming Kong's movements for the film's digital animators.|$|E

40|$|This paper defines an {{approach}} to simulation of natural systems, inspired by complex systems theory. A complex natural system is modeled as a multi-agent simulation system, agents representing living organisms, physical entities or environmental processes. Agents and their interactions can be aggregated to higher-level group agents. The properties <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> these group agents are determined by, or emerge from, the properties <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> the individual agents composing the group. Group agents discover macro-level natural laws implied by the properties <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> individual agents modeling micro-level natural entities. Such a system can be implemented in a distributed programming environment, exploiting emergence, hierarchy, and concurrency to perform large-scale simulations...|$|R
