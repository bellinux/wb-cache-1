5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not <b>as</b> <b>cool</b> <b>as</b> the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E

500|$|Following Metal Gear Solid 4s release, Raiden also {{appeared}} in more lists. IGN's Jesse Schedeen listed Raiden {{as one of the}} [...] "gaming icons" [...] and most valuable players of 2009, in response to his role in an upcoming Metal Gear title. Dave Meikleham of GamesRadar wrote an article entitled [...] "Why Metal Gear Solid: Rising [...] will make you love Raiden", explaining why fans who disliked the character would find his character and role appealing in the game. In a 2010 Famitsu readers' poll, Raiden was voted the 42nd most popular video game character. In 2013, Complex ranked Raiden as the 12th greatest soldier in video games, [...] "even as he's not <b>as</b> <b>cool</b> <b>as</b> Solid Snake," [...] while GamesRadar called Revengeance [...] "perhaps the greatest cyborg ninja game of all time" [...] and PLAY ranked Raiden as the second top ninja in games. While surpassed by Solid Snake, GamesRadar listed Raiden as the second best video game hero of all time. Raiden's role and development in Revengeance were found to be appealing, with GameSpot's Peter Brown praising his violent attitude that made him an outstanding anti-hero, whereas GameTrailers noted how Raiden contrasted his Metal Gear Solid 2 persona that had been criticized back in 2001.|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} and gameplay {{were the most}} praised aspects of the game. Scary Larry of GamePro hailed the game as being longer, more graphically impressive, and more fun than the original Donkey Kong Country, and having [...] "some of the most cleverly illustrated levels ever seen on a home system." [...] He gave it a perfect 5/5 in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and FunFactor), and said his one reservation is that some levels are too difficult for younger players. Aaron Kosydar of AllGame thought that Diddy's Kong Quests graphics were superior than that of its predecessor, stating that the game [...] "looks <b>as</b> <b>cool</b> <b>as</b> it plays". Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer stated that the graphics of the game were similar its predecessor, although he praised them both as [...] "impressive". However, Whitehead expressed concern over the lack of ambition from the sequel, stating that the gameplay uses the defence of [...] "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". Reviewing the SNES version, Frank Provo of GameSpot heralded the graphics as [...] "more detailed" [...] although admitting that it appeared stylistically similar to the first game. In a separate review regarding the Game Boy Advance version, Provo praised the graphics as richer and [...] "livelier" [...] {{than those of the}} original. In a retrospective review, Mark Birnbuam of IGN stated that whilst the original [...] "boasted {{some of the most beautiful}} graphics" [...] on the SNES at the time, Diddy's Kong Quest offered a superior experience due to its detail, smooth animation and varying colour palette.|$|E

500|$|Nintendo Power {{honored the}} game in its November 2010 issue, which celebrated the 25th anniversary of the NES. The {{magazine}} listed its box art, which depicts a ninja with a burning city in the background, {{as one of its}} favorite designs in the NES library. The magazine's Editor in Chief Chris Slate was equally impressed by the game's box art. He also reminisced the game's high level of difficulty with its re-spawning enemies and enemy birds that knocked players into pits, saying this game [...] "may have taught me how to curse". He further praised gameplay features such as clinging on walls and using ninpo techniques, and he noted the game's cinematic cutscenes, including the ominous opening sequence that featured two ninjas who launch into the air at each other and clashing their swords in the moonlight. He said that [...] "Ninja Gaiden was about <b>as</b> <b>cool</b> <b>as</b> an 8-bit game could be, especially for ninja-crazed kids of the '80s who, like me, had worn out their VHS copies of Enter the Ninja". In a July2011 issue, Retro Gamer listed the game's opening {{as one of the most}} popular ones at the time. The magazine noted how its usage of cutscenes, animations, and overall presentation put the game above most other action titles at the time. While it lauded the controls and gameplay elements, as with other reviews, it criticized the difficulty, calling it [...] "one of the most challenging games on the console". It noted how defeated enemies re-spawn in certain spots, how enemies are placed on the edges of platforms, and the structure of the final level.|$|E

He earned money for a set of amplifiers by helping him paint his house. Hoppus never took bass lessons, instead he taught himself by playing to bands such as the Descendents, The Cure, and Bad Religion.
