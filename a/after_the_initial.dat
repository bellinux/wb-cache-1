The Peabody Opera House (named for corporate contributor Peabody Energy) reopened on October 1, 2011, with performances by Jay Leno and Aretha Franklin.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} six months of operation, the subway was {{operated}} as a single system, with trains from Eglinton Station running through to either Keele or Woodbine station, while other trains connected the latter two points. However, the manoeuvre made operation of both lines more difficult, and the practice was abandoned <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> trial period, leaving Lower Bay Station abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Fruiting begins {{about six}} weeks <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> {{inoculation}} on the agar plate, but only when portions of fruit bodies (spines or stem sections) are used as the inoculum to initiate growth; the use of mycelium as the inoculum precludes subsequent fruiting. Mature fruit bodies grow {{very close to the}} initial site of inoculation—within 3mm—and take about 60 days to mature after they first start to form.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, {{thousands}} of oil workers were evacuated from Gulf of Mexico oil rigs.

In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> infection.

These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.|$|E

5|$|The Fukushima Hamadōri {{earthquake}} was {{succeeded by}} a number of smaller tremors; that same day, at least 11 earthquakes of magnitude3.5 Mj or higher were recorded near its epicentre.
