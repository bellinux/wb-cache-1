5|$|A small, unisex monastic {{community}} in Bithynia, near Constantinople, may {{have developed the}} cross-in-square plan church during the Iconoclastic period, which would explain the plan's small scale and unified naos. The ruined church of St. John at Pelekete monastery is an early example. Monks had supported the use of icons, unlike the government-appointed secular clergy, and monasticism would become increasingly popular. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>type</b> of privately funded urban monastery developed from the 9th century on, which may help to explain {{the small size of}} subsequent building.|$|E

The exact origin of the SARS virus is not known, but evidence suggests that it came from bats.|$|E
