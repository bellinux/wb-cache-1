40|$|ReviewThe {{importance}} of {{monitoring and evaluation}} for mental health service <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> delivery is indubitable. Notwithstanding, monitoring and evaluation of mental health policy <b>and</b> <b>plans</b> has received only limited attention. This paper presents an approach developed by the World Health Organization for monitoring mental health policy <b>and</b> <b>plans</b> that can be adapted and utilized for evaluation and monitoring of policy <b>and</b> <b>plans</b> in most other health spheres as well. Four critical areas are outlined i. e., evaluation of the policy document <b>and</b> the <b>plan</b> derived from it; monitoring {{the implementation of the}} strategic plan; evaluation of the implementation of the plan; and evaluation of whether the objectives of the policy have been achieved. Overcoming difficulties in objective assessment of policy documents <b>and</b> <b>plans</b> is discussed <b>and</b> two WHO checklists for evaluating the process, content and operational aspects of policies <b>and</b> <b>plans</b> are introduced together with a five step guidance process for conducting policy <b>and</b> <b>plan</b> evaluations. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
