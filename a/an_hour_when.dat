For {{some time after}} the start of the Turkish attack, the Turks {{opposite}} Quinn's just threw hand grenades at the post. Around 03:30 the Turks' machine-guns and rifles opened fire at the Australians. This lasted for about <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>when</b> the Turks went over the top and assaulted the post. As elsewhere, they were stopped by the weight of the Australian fire, not only from the trench they were attacking, but also by the defenders at Pope's and from the 2nd New Zealand Artillery Battery. Three more Turkish attacks were also repulsed in a similar fashion.|$|E

25|$|Phenobarbital, {{also known}} as phenobarbitone or phenobarb, is a {{medication}} recommended by the World Health Organization {{for the treatment of}} certain types of epilepsy in developing countries. In the developed world it is commonly used to treat seizures in young children, while other medications are generally used in older children and adults. It may be used intravenously, injected into a muscle, or taken by mouth. The injectable form may be used to treat status epilepticus. Phenobarbital is occasionally used to treat trouble sleeping, anxiety, and drug withdrawal and to help with surgery. It usually begins working within five minutes when used intravenously and half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>when</b> administered orally. Its effects last for between four hours and two days.|$|E

25|$|The lack of {{standardized}} timekeeping {{during this period}} of California's history contributed to some of the inaccurate reports of when the pre-shocks occurred. Local time was being used in 1857 and San Francisco would have been the locality with the most accurate time kept as it was a center of commerce and other activity. Standard time was not followed until the 1880s, with the Pacific Time Zone being aligned with the 120th meridian. The differences in local times were substantial, with San Francisco at 122.43 W and San Diego at 117.10 W, {{the difference between the two}} would be around 22 minutes (4 minutes per degree). At least one individual reported foreshock times that varied by as much as half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>when</b> speaking to two different newspapers.|$|E
25|$|The Cardinals {{followed}} with wins in Games 3 and 4, including another victory by Bob Gibson over Denny McLain in Game 4. Lou Brock stole three bases in Game 3 and had six steals {{in the first}} three games. In Game 4, McLain pitched poorly, giving up six runs in three innings. Game 4 also saw one of the most bizarre strategic battles in World Series history. The Cardinals led 4–0 in the third inning, when the game was delayed by rain for over <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> <b>When</b> play resumed, the Tigers began to stall, hoping to have the game called before it became official. The Cardinals responded by intentionally trying to make outs to move the game forward. As a result of the tactics, Game 4 of the 1968 series was criticized as one of the worst games in World Series history.|$|E
25|$|Southampton {{returned}} to St Mary's {{the following week}} to face Reading, who sat just three points behind 18th-placed Southampton in 19th position in the table. The game started relatively evenly {{with a number of}} chances for each side, with the home side's best chance coming after half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>when</b> Jason Puncheon turned in a corner to score a goal then disallowed for pushing in the penalty area. Just before half time team captain Adam Lallana received an injury, and was replaced by Gastón Ramírez who had not started the match. After the break the Saints continued to pressure the visitors, and in the 61st minute Jason Puncheon finally broke the deadlock to put Southampton one up. More chances went the way of the Saints, including late chances for Guly do Prado and Jack Cork, and ultimately the side held on to pick up the three points and move out of the relegation zone once again.|$|E

25|$|In the Battle of First Bar on 27 February, Herbert, {{while in}} the Calliope, also had the Herald, Alligator, Sulphur, Modeste, and the steamers Madagascar and Nemesis under his command.

In <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>when</b> the Chinese artillery was nearly silenced, he landed with the seamen and marines, and stormed the works, driving before them over 2,000 Chinese troops and killing nearly 300. The forts were under British possession {{about half an hour}} later. He participated in further campaigns in capturing the forts leading towards Canton. From June to July 1841, he was senior officer in the Canton River, and on the arrival of Sir William Parker, Herbert was moved to HMS Blenheim, in which he took part in the capture of Amoy and Chusan, and commanded the naval brigade at the capture of Chinhai. He was appointed a Companion of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath on 29 June, and a Knight Commander of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath on 14 October.|$|E
25|$|Though {{there was}} 35 minutes for England to bat until stumps they survived with 10/0 as a stormcloud loomed over the ground. Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson were sending down three short balls an over and Umpire Bailhache {{told them they}} should bowl fuller, but the next ball was a Thommo bouncer and the umpire gave the English batsmen {{the benefit of the}} bad light. Ian Chappell complained about the umpire's {{interference}} as strictly speaking he could not tell the bowlers what to bowl and the ABC commentator Frank Tyson agreed. Brian Luckhurst edged Lillee (2/25) to Ian Chappell early the next morning leaving Dennis Amiss and John Edrich to bat, both of whom had broken bones in their hands from the first innings. Edrich took pain-killing injections in the drinks break, but was plainly out of sorts and was bowled by Thomson (6/46). Amiss received a brute of a ball from Thomson that he sent to Doug Walters at third slip. This brought Mike Denness and Keith Fletcher together at 40/3 and they resisted for <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>when</b> the captain was taken by Walters off another Thommo thunderbolt, soon followed by Fletcher, caught by Greg Chappell off Terry Jenner (2/45) and Tony Greig bowled by Thomson yorker at 94/6. There was little hope of England lasting the day, but Alan Knott held out for two hours making 19, adding 29 with Peter Lever and 47 with the top-scorer Derek Underwood (30). When Underwood fell at 162/8, Knott and Hendrick soon followed and England were all out for 166 to lose by 166 runs, 84 minutes short of saving the game. Thomson took 6/46, which remained the best Test figures of his career.|$|E
25|$|Ian Redpath and Wally Edwards saw {{off the new}} {{ball and}} were 1/0 at stumps on the first day. The next day Bob Willis (2/91) hit Edwards with a bouncer and appealed for Redpath caught behind off his gloves, which was {{declined}} by the umpire. They took the score to 64 runs in less than <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>when</b> Edwards hit Tony Greig to David Lloyd at cover-point. The usually static Redpath was stumped when he danced down the wicket to Fred Titmus (2/84) and Ian Chappell edged Geoff Arnold (2/129) to Alan Knott while trying to leg glance, leaving Australia 113/3. Greg Chappell made 62, his fifth successive 50 against the tourists and added 79 runs with Ross Edwards by tea, though Titmus conceded only 20 runs in nine 8-ball overs. Chappell was out at 192/4 when he cut Willis into the gully where Colin Cowdrey knocked the ball up to be caught by Greig. After tea Doug Walters came out and took command of the game as Denness declined to use Willis to attack his well-known weakness around the off stump. Instead Greig sent up his slow off-cutters and gave away 69 runs off nine overs. Walters reached his 50 in 44 minutes, followed by that of Edwards in 174 minutes. The English fielding became ragged as they added 158 runs after tea. Walters reached his century off the last ball of the day by pulling Willis for six and was engulfed by fans {{as he left the}} field, as well they might as he was the first batsman since Bradman to score a hundred runs in a session in an Ashes Test. Australia were 352/4 and well ahead in the game, but the Australian team played a trick on Walters when he returned, hiding in the showers before coming out to congratulate him. He was out first thing the next day, caught by Fletcher in the gully off Willis waving his bat outside off-stump for 103, but Edwards stayed in to make 115, having been 79 overnight and became the first Western Australian to make a hundred at the WACA. He was bowled by Arnold, but Rod Marsh hit 41 and the tail added 65 runs before Chris Old cleared things up with 3/85. Australia made 481, a lead of 273 in the first innings and few thought England could avoid an innings defeat.|$|E

Another display indicates via green, amber, and red LEDs how much current is being used. The C5 is in its most economical running mode when a low amount of current, indicated by the green LEDs, is being used. When the lights are red, the motor is under a high load and the driver needs to use pedal power to avoid overheating and shutdown.|$|E

He went to Memphis for the 1968 Liberty Bowl, and to New York to attend the wedding of Nixon's daughter Julie to David Eisenhower. Agnew was a fan of the Baltimore Colts; in January, he was the guest of team owner Carroll Rosenbloom at Super Bowl III, and watched Joe Namath and the New York Jets upset the Colts, 16–7.
