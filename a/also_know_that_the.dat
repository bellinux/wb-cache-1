2500|$|The {{first half}} of the [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] must now be {{accounted}} for down to [...] "placatus accipias". This first half is a reduplication of the prayer [...] "Quam oblationem". Both contain exactly the same idea that God may graciously accept our offering. [...] "Hanc oblationem" [...] and [...] "Quam oblationem" [...] differ only in the relative construction of the second form. We know that the relative construction is not the original one. In the [...] "De Sacramentis", to which reference has several times been made, the [...] "Quam oblationem" [...] occurs as an absolute sentence: [...] "Fac nobis hanc oblationem adscriptam, rationabilem acceptabilemque, quod est figura corporis et sanguinis Domini nostri Iesu Christi" [...] (IV, v). We <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Igitur" [...] in [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] is not original. The parallel passages in Serapion and St. Mark's Liturgy have simply tauter ten thysian (Drews, 16). Moreover, the place and object of this prayer have varied very much. It has been applied to all sorts of purposes, and it is significant that it occurs specially often in connection with the dead (Ebner, Miss. Rom., 412). This would be a natural result, if we suppose it to be a compilation of two separate parts, both of which have lost their natural place in the Canon. Drews then proposes to supply the first words of the [...] "Quam oblationem" [...] that we have put in the first place of his reconstructed Canon (see above), by the {{first half of}} the [...] "Hanc igitur", so that (leaving out the igitur) the Canon would once have begun: [...] "Hanc oblationem servitutis nostr√¶, sed et cunct√¶ famili√¶ tu√¶, qu√¶sumus Domine, ut placatus accipias ut in omnibus benedictam, adscriptam, ratam, rationabilemque facere digneris, ut nobis corpus et sanguis fiat dilectissimi filii tui Domini nostri Iesu Christi" [...] (Drews, 30), and so on, according to the order suggested above. One word, [...] "ut", has been added to this compilation, to connect the [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] with the continuation of [...] "Quam oblationem". This word is vouched for by the Greek version, which has ina here (Swainson, 197). Drews further notes that such a change in the arrangement of the Canon is not inconceivable. Popes have modified its order on other occasions. Joannes Diaconus, the biographer of St. Gregory I, tells us that he re-arranged a few parts of the Canon ("pauca convertens", Vita Greg., II, xvii).|$|E

60|$|Here, {{the surest}} {{evidence}} {{is that of}} anthropology. We know that the pure Anglo-Saxons were a round-skulled, fair-haired, light-eyed, blonde-complexioned race; {{and we know that}} wherever (if anywhere) we find unmixed Germanic races at the present day, High Dutch, Low Dutch, or Scandinavian, we always meet with some of these same personal peculiarities in almost every individual of the community. But we <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Celts, originally themselves a similar blonde Aryan race, mixed largely in Britain with one or more long-skulled dark-haired, black-eyed, and brown-complexioned races, generally identified with the Basques or Euskarians, and with the Ligurians. The nation which resulted from this mixture showed traces of both types, being sometimes blonde, sometimes brunette; sometimes black-haired, sometimes red-haired, and sometimes yellow-haired. Individuals of all these types are still found in the undoubtedly Celtic portions of Britain, though the dark type there unquestionably preponderates so far as numbers are concerned. It is this mixed race of fair and dark people, of Aryan Celts with non-Aryan Euskarians or Ligurians, which we usually describe as Celtic in modern Britain, by contradistinction to the later wave of Teutonic English.|$|E

60|$|The {{other point}} is more interesting, and of more {{philosophical}} importance. It is, {{that we may}} sometimes know a general proposition in cases where {{we do not know}} a single instance of it. Take such a case as the following: We know that any two numbers can be multiplied together, and will give a third called their product. We know that all pairs of integers the product of which is less than 100 have been actually multiplied together, and the value of the product recorded in the multiplication table. But we <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of integers is infinite, and that only a finite number of pairs of integers ever have been or ever will be thought of by human beings. Hence it follows that there are pairs of integers which never have been and never will be thought of by human beings, and that all of them deal with integers the product of which is over 100. Hence we arrive at the proposition: 'All products of two integers, which never have been and never will be thought of by any human being, are over 100.' Here is a general proposition of which the truth is undeniable, and yet, from {{the very nature of the}} case, we can never give an instance; because any two numbers we may think of are excluded by the terms of the proposition.|$|E
6000|$|... 189. (2) The Limits of the Visible Church, {{or of the}} Church in the Second Scriptural Sense, are {{not so easy to}} define: {{they are}} awkward questions, these, of stake-nets. It has been ingeniously and plausibly {{endeavored}} to make Baptism a sign of admission into the Visible Church: but absurdly enough; for we know that half the baptized people in the world are very visible rogues, believing neither in God nor devil; and it is flat blasphemy to call these Visible Christians; we <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Holy Ghost was sometimes given before Baptism,[143] and it would be absurdity to call a man, on whom the Holy Ghost had fallen, an Invisible Christian. The only rational distinction is that which practically, though not professedly, we always assume. If we hear a man profess himself a believer in God and in Christ, and detect him in no glaring and willful violation of God's law, we speak of him as a Christian; and, on the other hand, if we hear him or see him denying Christ, either in his words or conduct, we tacitly assume him not to be a Christian. A mawkish charity prevents us from outspeaking in this matter, and from earnestly endeavoring to discern who are Christians and who are not; and this I hold[144] {{to be one of the}} chief sins of the Church in the present day; for thus wicked men are put to no shame; and better men are encouraged in their failings, or caused to hesitate in their virtues, by the example of those whom, in false charity, they choose to call Christians. Now, it being granted that it is impossible to know, determinedly, who are Christians indeed, that is no reason for utter negligence in separating the nominal, apparent, or possible Christian, from the professed Pagan or enemy of God. We spend much time in arguing about efficacy of sacraments and such other mysteries; but we do not act upon the very certain tests which are clear and visible. We know that Christ's people are not thieves--not liars--not busybodies--not dishonest--not avaricious--not wasteful--not cruel. Let us then get ourselves well clear of thieves--liars--wasteful people--avaricious people--cheating people--people who do not pay their debts. Let us assure them that they, at least, do not belong to the Visible Church; and having thus got that Church into decent shape and cohesion, it will be time to think of drawing the stake-nets closer.|$|E
