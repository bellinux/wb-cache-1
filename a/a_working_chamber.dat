500|$|The Königs {{were armed}} with a main battery of ten [...] SK L/50 guns in five twin turrets. Two turrets were mounted forward of the main {{superstructure}} in a superfiring pair, the third {{was placed on the}} centerline between the two funnels amidships, and the fourth and fifth turrets were also arranged in a superfiring pair, aft of the rear conning tower. Each gun turret had <b>a</b> <b>working</b> <b>chamber</b> beneath it that was connected to a revolving ammunition hoist leading down to the magazine below it. The turrets were electrically controlled, though the guns were elevated hydraulically. In an effort to reduce the possibility of a fire, everything in the turret was constructed of steel. The centerline arrangement was an improvement over the preceding , as all ten guns could fire on a wide arc on the broadside, and four guns could fire directly ahead, as opposed to only two on the Kaisers. The guns were supplied with 900 rounds, or 90 shells per gun. The 30.5cm gun had a rate of fire of between 2–3 405.5-kilogram (894-pound) armor-piercing shells per minute, and was expected to fire 200 shells before replacement was necessary. The guns were also capable of firing 405.9kg (894.8lb) high explosive shells. Both types of shells were loaded with two propellant charges: an RP C/12 main charge in a brass cartridge that weighed 91kg (201lb) and an RP C/12 fore charge in a silk bag that weighed 34.5kg (76lb). This provided a muzzle velocity of 855meters per second (2,805ft/s). The turrets on the König-class battleships initially allowed elevation up to 13.5degrees; this enabled a maximum range of 16,200m (17,700yd). After modifications, elevation was increased to 16degrees, which correspondingly increased the range of the guns to 20,400m (22,300yd).|$|E

40|$|The {{hypocycloid}} mechanism, in {{its basic}} or modified version, {{can be used}} in reciprocating machines as an alternative solution to the conventional crankshaft-connecting rod system. This kinematic device is quite old in concept, but still gives rise to some research since it has some positive mechanical features, and it allows several functions to be easily combined. In the hypocycloid mechanism in fact the connecting rod has a perfectly sinusoidal straight-line motion, a characteristic that theoretically reduces the piston side thrust to zero and permits a perfect balance of inertia forces without auxiliary rotating shafts. Moreover, by means of a second head with suitable seals that prevent leakage to the crankcase, the lower portion of the cylinder can be used as <b>a</b> second <b>working</b> <b>chamber</b> without using the crosshead thus reducing the dimensions of the double acting machine.
