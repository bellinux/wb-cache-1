25|$|Very outspoken {{about his}} ideas, he begged Nicholas II {{to cancel the}} {{coronation}} ball at the French embassy in Moscow following the Khodynka Tragedy, warning him that holding it would create a perception of monarchical indifference such as had made Marie Antoinette unpopular. When it was held nevertheless, he arrived with his brothers, then departed soon after in protest. His manner could turn caustic. The Imperial family <b>always</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had a mean and critical tongue. He loathed Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna and her family, the Vladimirovichi. A vehement critic of most of his male cousins, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich in particular, Nicholas Mikhailovich was a divisive figure among the Romanovs.|$|E
500|$|For me, I {{was a new}} {{actor to}} Los Angeles, didn’t know the TV {{business}} very well so I was just excited to work and play a vampire. I had no clue what I {{was going to do}} or how I was going to be scary. Until that is, they put the vampire makeup on me and I went into the trailer and smiled, which I thought was creepy. Joss <b>always</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was intrigued that someone who looked like me and talked like me was like the scariest vampire ever. That's what he wanted, my sweet voice and demeanour until all of a sudden I'm just this vicious vampire." ...|$|E

500|$|Ian Ogilvy as Richard Marshall. Ogilvy {{had been}} a friend of Reeves since they were teenagers, and the actor had {{appeared}} {{in many of the}} director's amateur short films. Ogilvy had also starred in both of Reeves's two previous feature films, Revenge of the Blood Beast and The Sorcerers, and was the natural first choice for the role of Witchfinders heroic lead. Describing his working relationship with Reeves, Ogilvy noted that [...] "his mastery of the technical aspects was absolute", but added [...] "Mike never directed the actors. He <b>always</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> knew nothing about acting, and preferred to leave it up to us." [...] Ogilvy enjoyed working with Price, finding him to be [...] "very funny, in a 'queeny' sort of way." ...|$|E

After his death, his friends and family, including his sister, Geraldine (Geri), reflected on his death. Geri commented, [...] "He was a very opinionated person." [...] Friend John Garrity added, [...] "The mountain and the lake were his life. If he'd left and then saw what the mountain did to his lake, it would have killed him anyway. He <b>always</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> wanted to die at Spirit Lake. He went {{the way he wanted}} to go." [...] Another friend, John Andersen, said, [...] "Harry's name and Harry's presence will always {{be a part of that}} (Spirit Lake). There can be no finer memorial." [...] Truman's cousin ...|$|E
2500|$|The antisemitic {{attack on}} Streitman {{was taken up}} in Parliament by the {{opposition}} National-Christian Defense League (or LANC), through the voice of Transylvanian Valeriu Pop. Pop, who noted that the supposed quote could {{be traced back to}} Die Weltkampf paper (of the Militant League for German Culture), accused the PP of having betrayed the cause of [...] "nationalist activity". Streitman was publicly defended by another parliamentarian, Mișu Papp-Craiova, who called himself a man of [...] "antisemitic principles". Papp-Craiova argued: [...] "Streitman was the only Jew to have exhibited a dignified attitude during the war. [...] this particular Jew has never described himself as a Jew, but has <b>always</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was a Romanian." ...|$|E

2500|$|TE Tony Gonzalez {{met with}} Chiefs GM Carl Peterson during the bye week and inquired about a trade to a playoff contender. Gonzalez, who had <b>always</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{would like to}} end {{his career with the}} Chiefs, voiced his desire to play for a Super Bowl contending team and the {{rebuilding}} Chiefs would like to acquire extra draft picks. Buffalo, Atlanta, Green Bay, Philadelphia, and the New York Giants had been in contact with the Chiefs regarding Gonzalez. The Giants were considered to be the front-runners, but showed [...] "lukewarm" [...] interest. The Packers offered a third round draft choice, but the deal was not finalized, and Gonzalez remained with the Chiefs after the trading deadline passed.|$|E
2500|$|During X's {{history the}} lineup changed twice. The first {{was caused by}} the death of Ian Krahe, which reduced the band to three members before they {{recorded}} their first album X-Aspirations (1979) in five hours at Trafalgar Studios in Sydney. The lineup changed a second time on their first Melbourne tour when the band reformed in the early 1980s. The tour was organised by then manager Nick Chance with booking agent Gerrard S (last name?) at Premier Artists in Melbourne, another long time fan of X. Cafiero had <b>always</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would not go to Melbourne; [...] when advised of tour dates, he stuck to his word and would not go, citing family commitments and the fact that his career choice of real estate would be in the balance if he did.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Chrétien {{decided to}} follow up his victory in Reference re Secession of Quebec in 1998 by passing the Clarity Act. Jean Pelletier {{recalled}} in an interview about {{the genesis of the}} Clarity Act: [...] "The Clarity Act was Jean Chrétien's idea. I don't want to minimize the role of Dion, but in the beginning, he was not in favour of it. In fact, when the Act was brought to cabinet, there was only one vote in favour, and it was Jean Chrétien. Everyone else was against or unsure, including Dion. We tried twice to get Jean Charest to carry the ball for the Act. We met him twice, Dion and me, but he refused. There was one meeting in the spring and another in the autumn of 1999. The package was ready, the law was printed and it was ready to be introduced." [...] In December 1999 the Chrétien government tabled the Clarity Act, which passed Parliament in June 2000. The Clarity Act, which was Chrétien's response to his narrow victory in the 1995 referendum requires that no Canadian Government may acknowledge any province's declaration of independence unless a [...] "clear majority" [...] supports a [...] "clear question" [...] about sovereignty in a referendum, as defined by the Parliament of Canada, and a constitutional amendment is passed. The size of a [...] "clear majority" [...] is not specified in the Act. After the Clarity Act had passed by the House of Commons in February 2000, a poll showed that the federalist forces enjoyed a 15% lead in the polls on the question if Quebec should become independent, which Chrétien argued meant that the sovereignty option was now effectively off the table as Bouchard had <b>always</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would only call another referendum if he could obtain [...] "winning conditions", which he plainly did not possess at the moment.|$|E
