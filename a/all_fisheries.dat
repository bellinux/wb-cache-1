25|$|Discarding is {{a problem}} in <b>all</b> <b>fisheries,</b> and nations have adopted a number of {{measures}} to deal with the issue. The idea of banning discards is that since the fish that are discarded have a negligible chance of survival it is better from a management perspective that they are included in the fishing induced mortality figures on which allowable catch estimates are based.|$|E
25|$|Fishing {{takes place}} around South Georgia and in {{adjacent}} waters in some {{months of the}} year, with fishing licences sold by the territory for Patagonian toothfish, cod icefish and krill. Fishing licences bring in millions of pounds a year, most of which is spent on fishery protection and research. <b>All</b> <b>fisheries</b> are regulated and managed {{in accordance with the}} Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) system.|$|E
500|$|Catching {{fish for}} the purpose of food or sport is known as fishing, while the {{organized}} effort by humans to catch fish is called a fishery. Fisheries are a huge global business and provide income for millions of people. The annual yield from <b>all</b> <b>fisheries</b> worldwide is about 154 million tons, with popular species including herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, and salmon.

2500|$|Commercial {{fishing is}} the main {{industry}} in Cordova. Half of all households in Cordova {{have at least one}} person involved in commercial fishing or processing. The fishing fleet mainly fishes the Prince William Sound and Copper River Delta area. There are various fisheries in the area, the most economically important of which is the salmon fishery. All Pacific salmon species except for the cherry salmon are caught. Fishermen use either a purse seine, drift gillnet, or set gillnet to catch the fish. <b>All</b> <b>fisheries</b> are regulated by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The fisheries in Alaska have a limited entry permit system. The first fish processing plant near Cordova opened in 1887. In 2009 there were 159 purse seine, 511 drift gilnet, and 27 set gillnet permits fished in the Prince William Sound and Copper River Delta area. Wild fish stocks are augmented by hatcheries where fish are produced and released as fingerlings into rivers. [...] Eventually they migrate to the ocean where they grow to breeding age and then return as adults to be caught by the fishermen or to spawn.|$|E

5000|$|France's {{claim to}} the island dates from 1843, {{when a group of}} {{fishermen}} from Réunion, interested in setting up a fishery on Saint-Paul, pushed the Governor of Réunion to take possession of both Saint-Paul and Amsterdam Island. This was performed by means of an official decree dated 8 June 1843, and on 1 July, Martin Dupeyrat, commanding the ship L'Olympe, landed on Amsterdam Island and then on Saint-Paul on 3 July, and hoisted the tricolor. The only surviving evidence of this claim is an inscribed rock situated on the edge of Saint-Paul's crater lake, inscribed [...] "Pellefournier Emile Mazarin de Noyarez, Grenoble, Canton de Sassenage, Département de l'Isère, 1844". <b>All</b> <b>fishery</b> operations were, however, abandoned in 1853, when the French government renounced its possession of the two islands.|$|R

50|$|The Fisheries Monitoring Centre was {{originally}} established as the National Supervisory Centre (NSC) in the mid-1980s.

Such data included sightings, boardings, warnings and detention of vessels. The creation of the NSC was therefore created as a single point for the processing of <b>all</b> <b>fisheries</b> activity in the Irish EEZ.|$|E

These figures were official even though the FAO knew they were false, that the catch was actually decreasing. In 1997, the Grand Banks cod fisheries of Newfoundland, Canada, had collapsed. 75% of <b>all</b> <b>fisheries</b> were either fully exploited or overfished.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} bigeye tuna stock projections to evaluate the effects of various exemptions and exclusions in CMM- 2008 - 01, as requested at the 5 th annual session of the WCPFC scientific committee. Consistent with previous work, the projections employed two key model runs from the 2009 bigeye tuna assessment (run 10 and run 14) combined with two assumptions regarding future bigeye tuna recruitment (SRR recruit and AV recruit). A total of 11 projection scenarios were devised and the key indicators (F/FMSY and SB/SBMSY in the terminal year of the projections) estimated for each scenario/assessment model/recruitment assumption combination. For the most part, the individual exemptions have a relatively modest impact on the indicators. It is again demonstrated that measures need to be implemented across <b>all</b> <b>fishery</b> sectors with significant bigeye catches if meaningful reductions of fishing mortality are to be achieved. ...|$|R
40|$|Subsidies in {{the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s fishing {{industry}} have long been considered to have harmful effects on fish stocks. The fishing industry has suffered from overcapacity for many years, and subsidies encourage investment, leading to greater capacity and more pressure on fish stocks, {{many of which are}} already exploited close to extinction. However, this paper argues, that not <b>all</b> <b>fishery</b> subsidies have this effect on the fish resource. In Ireland, there is evidence suggesting that fishery subsidies are used increasingly for the purpose of employment creation in disadvantaged regions, through land-based investments, rather than to increase fishing capacity. Abolishing fishery subsidies in Ireland is, therefore, not likely to have huge effects on the fishing fleet, while the effects on rural communities could be grave. For politicians ever to consider the removal of subsidies, alternative policies must be developed to assist people that live in disadvantaged regions...|$|R
40|$|Even though {{landing of}} fish varies like the {{previous}} years, the fisheries management units of bonito and tuna fishery in Nakaminato-shi in Ibaraki prefecture have chances for bankruptcy. This has been seen in almost <b>all</b> <b>fishery</b> management units in Japan. Even a small decrease in fish landing or little depression have influence in small and medium scale enterprises. This is due to over investment in fixed assets. So that in this article financial analysis is used with the statement of fund usage and the classification of different patterns of fishery management units. The big enterprises are going to full bankruptcy even without making them small in scale. This {{is because they are}} investing on fixed assets and buying fishing licences, with the only idea of increasing their profit without preparing enough personal capital. Also this type of things make these enterprises unable to repay their loans and interest and go to bankruptcy. ...|$|R
50|$|In the Republic of Ireland, {{catch and}} release {{has been used}} as a {{conservation}} tool for atlantic salmon and sea trout fisheries since 2003. A number of fisheries now have mandatory catch and release regulations. Catch and release for coarse fish has been used by sport anglers for as long as these species have been fished for on this island. However catch and release for Atlantic salmon has required a huge turn about in how many anglers viewed the salmon angling resource. To encourage anglers to practice catch and release in <b>all</b> <b>fisheries</b> a number of Government led incentives have been implemented.|$|E
5000|$|The living {{resource}} {{section of}} the agreement states the goal of [...] "restore, enhance and protect, the finfish, shellfish, and other living resources, their habitats and ecological relationship to sustain <b>all</b> <b>fisheries</b> and provide for a balanced ecosystem."

This section also touches on multi-species management, a tenfold increase in the native oyster population, as well as resident and migratory fish passage.|$|E
50|$|Fishing has {{declined}} due to habitat degradation, overfishing, trawling, bycatch and climate change. Since {{the growth of}} global fishing enterprises after the 1950s, intensive fishing has spread from a few concentrated areas to encompass nearly <b>all</b> <b>fisheries.</b> The scraping of the ocean floor in bottom dragging is devastating to coral, sponges and other long-lived species that do not recover quickly. This destruction alters {{the functioning of the}} ecosystem and can permanently alter species composition and biodiversity. Bycatch, the capture of unintended species in the course of fishing, is typically returned to the ocean only to die from injuries or exposure. Bycatch represents about a quarter of all marine catch. In the case of shrimp capture, the bycatch is five times larger than the shrimp caught.|$|E
