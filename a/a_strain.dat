5|$|A British {{beekeeper}} successfully developed <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> of bees {{that are}} resistant to varroa mites. Russian honey bees also resist infestations of varroa mites but are still susceptible to other factors associated with colony collapse disorder, and have detrimental traits that limit their relevance in commercial apiculture.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>strain</b> is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> may gain pathogenic capacity, {{the ability to use}} a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E
40|$|The {{solid-phase}} radioimmunoassay inhibition {{method was}} {{used to analyze the}} noncapsular surface antigens of group A Neisseria meningitidis for type specificity. By use of antisera prepared against group <b>A</b> <b>strains,</b> three serologically distinct lipopolysaccharide antigens and five outer membrane protein antigens were identified among group <b>A</b> <b>strains</b> from <b>a</b> variety of geographical origins. Two of the lipopolysaccharide antigens were unique to group <b>A</b> <b>strains</b> while the third was similar to those on strains of other meningococcal serogroups. Fractionation of outer membrane proteins in the presence of 2 % sodium deoxycholate followed by quantitative inhibition of the typing reactions with the subfractions revealed that the protein responsible for type specificity was not the principal outer membrane protein, but, most likely, the 31, 000 -dalton, heat-modifiable outer membrane protein. Thus, although group <b>A</b> <b>strains</b> may share <b>a</b> common principal outer membrane protein, typing is feasible using other surface antigens. In a survey of 82 group <b>A</b> <b>strains,</b> 93 % were typable with respect to outer membrane proteins...|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>strain</b> {{of truly}} domesticated red foxes was {{introduced}} by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.|$|E

In 1933, the C {{and the rest of the}} Underground Group was taken into public ownership. Today, its tunnels and stations form the Bank Branch of the Northern line from Camden Town to Kennington and the southern leg of the line from Kennington to Morden.|$|E

The Spanish jennet ancestors of the Andalusian also developed the Colonial Spanish Horse in America, which became the foundation bloodstock for many North and South American breeds. The Andalusian has also been used to create breeds more recently, with breed associations for both the Warlander (an Andalusian/Friesian cross) and the Spanish-Norman (an Andalusian/Percheron cross) being established in the 1990s.|$|E

Montag and Pratt moved into an apartment together in the season finale, at which point Patridge became Conrad's new housemate.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} environment, several life forms {{have been found}} that can {{withstand}} extreme space conditions for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA BIOPAN facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007.

The lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world.
