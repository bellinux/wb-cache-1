5|$|The Temple is {{surrounded}} by sites where villagers worship, generating the power needed to cast miracles. Villagers require feeding, healing or rest to worship. How many villagers worship is controlled at the Village Centre, and which miracles are available depends on those available at the player's villages. Miracles include providing food or wood, healing people, and providing shields to protect an area. Miracles can also be cast by using Miracle Dispensers, a common reward for completing Silver Reward Scrolls. These allow the casting of a miracle without worship. Miracles can only be cast, and most other actions performed, within the player's <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence,</b> which can be extended by expanding the population of villages owned, or by taking over others. Miracles can be selected at the Temple or Village Centre, or by performing certain gestures with the Hand. Power can also be produced by sacrificing living beings at the altar.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{additional}} signaling {{and observation}} towers were frequently built outside the city, and were sometimes fortified in a castle-like fashion. The {{border of the}} <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> {{of the city was}} often partially or fully defended by elaborate ditches, walls and hedges. The crossing points were usually guarded by gates or gate houses. These defenses were regularly checked by riders, who often also served as the gate keepers. Long stretches of these defenses can still be seen to this day, and even some gates are still intact. To further protect their territory, rich cities also established castles in their <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence.</b> An example of this practice is the Romanian Bran Castle, which was intended to protect nearby Kronstadt (today's Braşov).|$|E
