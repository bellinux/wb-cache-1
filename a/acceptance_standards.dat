Since then, the online community has moved onto {{a large number of}} unofficial websites and forums for Lord of the Rings players, many of which were already in existence before {{the closure of}} Games Workshop's forums: these include [...] "The Last Alliance", with over 6400 registered members (rebuilt in 2009 due to the host deleting their server for financial reasons), [...] "The One-Ring", with over 5000, and [...] "", with over 2400 members. Collectively, the members of these websites have produced high-quality articles for the public, namely on The One-Ring, whose <b>acceptance</b> <b>standards</b> are very high, in greater quantity than on the official site, and White Dwarf has commented on the community as having a [...] "huge wealth of material".|$|E
50|$|When {{mental health}} {{professionals}} fail to undertake comprehensive, impartial, and scientifically informed assessments, they risk challenges to the admissibility {{of the evidence that}} they present to court and having it dismissed as poor or “junk science.” The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (1993) provided a basis for determining acceptable science in court, and required judges to function as “gatekeepers” for evaluating the probative or helpful value of the testimony for the case at hand. Two additional, related SCOTUS cases—General Electric Co. v. Joiner (1997) and Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael (1999)- may be added to comprise what is often referenced as the “Daubert trilogy.” A Canadian case that addresses many of the same issues is R. v. Mohan (1994). Some states still function according to Frye, or general <b>acceptance</b> <b>standards,</b> in determination of admissibility to court (Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013, 34 ALR 145 (D. C. Cir 1923). Also, see the Federal Rules of Evidence (United States Government Printing Office, 2009).|$|E
5000|$|Quality bias {{can work}} both ways. Faster {{computers}} with enhanced performance require greater memory {{and more expensive}} support software. Most personal computers were previously bundled with software, but now come only with a basic operating system and a requirement for the purchaser to purchase the bundled software after a [...] "trial period", so the actual value per dollar is much lower. Obsolescence is built into most personal electronics, shortening their useful live, again lowering the actual value. All these issues make the quality bias tend to be negative rather than positive. As products and the manufacturing methodology advances, the cost of manufacture {{is expected to go}} down, and improved products are part of every product life cycle, and many products go through repeated cycling. An example is the automobile. Quality bias is most often seen in a negative manner in the cases of mature products as companies lower their <b>acceptance</b> <b>standards</b> in order to increase their profit margins. There is no effective measure for declining quality, unfortunately, which is why some nations such as Germany and Japan have developed very meticulous standards for nearly everything, including services. The DIN and JIS enable anyone to evaluate whether or not an article has been properly produced. There is no such standard in the U.S., except for some scattered attempts by insurers to control electrical quality (such as UL). Engineering standards, such as ASME and ASTM; Automotive, such as ASE and ISO are not effective standards and do not compare with JIS or DIN because it is self-imposed, self-regulated, and self-inspected by the very people it is designed to regulate.|$|E

30|$|When {{the depth}} of gap is {{evaluated}} by inserting a steel ruler, the depth varies obviously at corners but the variation can be neglected at the quarter points (Figs.  11, 12). Without the rail (Fig.  11), the gap at site 1 maintains at the greatest value about 49  mm from 02 : 00 to 06 : 00, which meets the <b>acceptance</b> <b>standard</b> (less than 50  mm). Consistent with Fig.  7, the maximum value of depth is 16  mm larger than the initial value, while the depth at the quarter points remains almost unchanged. For track slab with rail laid (Fig.  12), the maximum depth is 19.5  mm at 04 : 00, while the initial depth is 13  mm. The difference between the initial and the maximum values is 6.5  mm, which is 9.5  mm (59.4 %) {{less than that of}} track slab without rail. The test results of gap width and depth indicate that rail can efficiently diminish the gap.|$|R

As discussed in a conference call with the Staff on April 30, 2001, these inspections have identified an indication in a circumferential weld in the reactor head (Weld HCC-B 002, Vessel Head Dollar Weld). The indication does not meet ASME Section XI IWB- 3 500 <b>acceptance</b> <b>standards,</b> but has been found acceptable per IWB- 3600. Paragraphs IWB- 2430 and IWC- 2430 require additional examinations to be performed when examinations reveal indications exceeding the applicable <b>acceptance</b> <b>standards</b> of Table IWB- 3410 - 1 for Class 1 and of Article IWC- 3000 for Class 2.

The current Section III requirements have been effective in meeting the design objective of preventing pressure boundary failures. However, the rules are sufficiently conservative that not only are structurally significant flaws excluded, but they also exclude more benign indications that have no impact on structural integrity.
