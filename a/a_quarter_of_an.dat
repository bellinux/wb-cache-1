5|$|Parallel to his joining New York City FC, Villa was {{announced}} to {{have joined the}} Australian A-League with Melbourne City, following the team's association with Manchester City. Villa was on a guest stint, allowing him to make up to ten appearances for Melbourne City during the 2014–15 season, {{taking advantage of the}} scheduling of the A-League and MLS to maintain match fitness ahead of his debut with New York City. After only joining Melbourne City for pre-season training just over a week before their first game, Villa was brought on in the 48th minute of {{the first game of the}} season against Sydney FC, and scored a debut goal <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> hour into his appearance. On 19 October 2014, in his second match, Villa scored an 87th-minute equaliser against the Newcastle Jets for a 11 draw.|$|E
5|$|The final was {{postponed}} from its scheduled start on Monday at 4p.m. until Thursday, 19 July, at 3:30p.m. because of rain. On Thursday {{it was still}} showery, causing the final to be further delayed by an hour. It began on a dead and slippery court in front of about 200 spectators. There was a temporary three-plank stand {{on one side of}} the court offering seating to about thirty people. Marshall won the toss, elected to serve first and was immediately broken by Gore. After the first set was won by Gore, it started to rain for <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> hour; this further softened the ground and affected the quality of play. The final lasted 48 minutes, and Spencer Gore won the inaugural championship against William Marshall in three straight sets of 15, 13, and 20 minutes respectively. En route to the title Gore had won 15 sets and lost two and won 99 games for the loss of 46. Gore, the volley specialist, had beaten the baseline player, at a time when volleying was considered by some to be unsporting. Some tried to outlaw the volley and a discussion on its merits took place in The Field for weeks after the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Heading into Memorial Day Weekend, United {{wrapped up}} May {{with the opening}} match of their two-game West Coast road trip on 29 May at Jeld-Wen Field {{to take on the}} Portland Timbers. The Timbers, who held a 5–3–2 record prior to the match had won every single match at home during MLS play. United {{successfully}} ended that home streak with a 3–2 victory over the Timbers, thanks to goals from Perry Kitchen, his first professional goal in his career, as well as Chris Pontius and Josh Wolff. In the match, Kitchen opened the scoring for United with a 13th-minute half-volley thanks to a redirected header from Dejan Jakovic. While United were able to hold the 1–0 lead well into the second half of play, a chain of contentious decisions from center official Geoff Gamble, but primarily linesmen Eric Proctor. It was only the second MLS match that Gamble officiated, with his first coming on the previous weekend. In the 67th minute of play, United conceded a penalty kick to the Timbers. United goalkeeper, Bill Hamid initially saved Timbers striker Kenny Cooper's first penalty shot, only for the shot to be retaken. Proctor flagged for a retaking of the kick claiming that Hamid stepping off his line before the kick was taken, an infraction of the rules. The contrasting argument from Hamid, as well as other United players, was that Cooper stutter-stepped before taking the ball, which is illegal in the Laws of the Game. Nevertheless, it was ruled that a second retake would be taken, again by Cooper. Hamid consecutively saved the shot, only for Proctor to again rule that Hamid repeated the same original infraction. The ruling caused Hamid to storm over to Proctor in disdain for his decision, consequently earning Hamid a yellow card for dissent. For the third shot on the mark, Timbers captain Jack Jewsbury took the shot and buried it in the bottom left-hand post, leveling the score at 1–1. The stalemate was tentative, as Diego Chara of the Timbers conceded a penalty in the box when he mistimed a slide tackle on Pontius, leading to a handball. Pontius scored his second penalty of the season, and his second consecutive in league play to give United the 2–1 advantage. <b>A</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> hour later, Wolff notched a goal, extending United's lead in the 85th minute. The Timbers' Jorge Perlaza scored a consolation goal in the 88th minute of play, but it would fail to be enough.|$|E

Loire took the prize in tow to Plymouth where the prisoners were disembarked on 31 August.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, India toured England, in {{the first}} home series since the Ashes defeat a number of {{experienced}} players were dropped. However, Evans remained and {{in the first}} Test of the summer he justified his selection with a run-a-ball innings of 73, which contained 12 boundaries. Norman Preston in Wisden described it as 'daring hitting' which 'reduced the hitherto keen Indian bowling to a thing of shreds and patches'. In the second Test at Lord's Evans missed four stumpings off Tommy Greenhough in the space of <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> hour, he otherwise kept well and didn't concede a bye in the match. Evans was dropped from the team for the next Test 'in the interests of team building', the reason given by the selectors. His England test cap number is 315.|$|E
25|$|As a cricketer, domesticity {{was just}} not in his line. He began his innings usually as one who, {{suffering}} from violent astigmatism, has not only mislaid his glasses, but had in addition a fearful headache. He made a pass or two after the ball had gone past him: he lunged fitfully and missed: he stabbed down just in time at the straight ones: he sliced the rising offside ball over the second slip: he snicked hazily past his leg stump. So, for about <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> hour, it went on: or, to such an agonized onlooker as I, it seemed to go on. Then suddenly, he would catch a half volley or a long hop such a crack that the bowler, fearful of his own safety, lost all his aggressive intention, and, with it, any idea of length.|$|E

25|$|A gyrocompass, {{employed}} for navigation of seagoing vessels, finds the geometric north. It does so, not by sensing the Earth's magnetic field, but by using inertial space as its reference. The outer casing of the gyrocompass device {{is held in}} such a way that it remains aligned with the local plumb line. When the gyroscope wheel inside the gyrocompass device is spun up, the way the gyroscope wheel is suspended causes the gyroscope wheel to gradually align its spinning axis with the Earth's axis. Alignment with the Earth's axis is the only direction for which the gyroscope's spinning axis can be stationary with respect to the Earth and not be required to change direction with respect to inertial space. After being spun up, a gyrocompass can reach the direction of alignment with the Earth's axis in as little as <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> hour.|$|E
25|$|Ulyett {{also played}} in the first-ever Test match, staged at the MCG, during that tour. His first real action in Test cricket came when he held onto a catch off the bowling of James Southerton to dismiss Billy Midwinter for five. With the bat, however, Ulyett failed in the first innings, lasting just <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> hour before Nat Thomson had him trapped in front; in the second innings, however, with England in dire straits, he fought hard with John Selby for about 45 minutes—but then the rampant Tom Kendall got one through his defences and {{effectively}} brought an end to England's resistance, the match being lost by 45 runs. In bowling, Ulyett took three for 39 in the second innings, his first wicket being that of Charles Bannerman, who famously managed an incredible 165 out of Australia's first innings total of 245 (or 67.3 per cent of it, still a Test-Match record). This amazing effort finally {{came to an end}} when the toiling Ulyett let loose a sharp, rising bouncer that found its way through Bannerman's primitive gloving and struck him a blow on the index finger, splitting it open rather badly. A short delay revealed the fact that Bannerman could no longer grip his bat properly and that, therefore, he would have to retire. The Australian opener walked off, wincing from the pain in his bloodied right hand. George Ulyett, although never regarded as a truly-quick bowler, could nevertheless do real damage on occasion. Bannerman was unable to field, and, in the second innings, when Ulyett dismissed him again (this time in orthodox fashion—bowled), he faced just nine deliveries.|$|E
25|$|Blake's great {{innovation}} in relief etching was to print from the relief, or raised, {{parts of the}} plate rather than the intaglio, or incised, parts. Whereas intaglio methods worked by creating furrows into which the acid was poured to create 'holes' in the plate and the ink then poured over the entire surface, Blake wrote and drew directly onto the plate with an acid-resistant material known as a stop-out. He would then embed the plate’s edges in strips of wax to create a self-contained tray and pour the acid about <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inch deep, thus causing the exposed parts of the plate to melt away, and the design and/or text to remain slightly above {{the rest of the}} plate, i.e. in relief, like a modern rubber stamp. The acid was then poured off, the wax was removed, and the raised part of the plate covered with ink before finally being pressed onto the paper in the printing press. This method allowed expressive effects which were impossible to achieve via intaglio. The major disadvantage was that text had to be written backwards as whatever was on the plate would print in reverse when pressed onto the paper. The dominant theory as to how Blake solved this problem is simply that he wrote in reverse. Another theory, suggested by David Bindman, is that Blake wrote his (acid resistant) text on a sheet of paper the correct way around, and then pressed the paper onto the plate, thus reversing the text and producing the same result as if had he written it backwards in the first place.|$|E
