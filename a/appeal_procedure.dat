25|$|Various {{researchers}} {{argue that}} the overall tendency to exculpate Antonescu was endorsed by the ruling National Salvation Front and its successor group, later known as Social Democratic Party, who complemented an emerging pro-authoritarian lobby while depicting their common opponent King Michael and his supporters as traitors. Sections of both governing and opposition groups contemplated the idea of rehabilitating the wartime leader, and, in May 1991, Parliament observed {{a moment of silence}} in his memory. The perceived governmental tolerance of Antonescu's rehabilitation raised international concern and protests. In 1997, Romanian President Emil Constantinescu, a representative of the Democratic Convention, became the first Romanian officeholder to recognize Antonescu's complicity. Nevertheless, during the same period, Attorney General Sorin Moisescu followed a since-deprecated special <b>appeal</b> <b>procedure</b> to overturn sentences passed against Antonescu and other 1946 defendants, which he eventually withdrew.|$|E

2500|$|Later {{that same}} year, Hoffman and Jonathan Silvers wrote Steal This Urine Test (published October 5, 1987), which exposed the {{internal}} contradictions of the War on Drugs and suggested ways to circumvent its most intrusive measures.

2500|$|The Statute of the Court and TFEU require {{judges are}} {{appointed}} {{only if they}} have no political occupation, with independence [...] "beyond doubt". They are selected for renewable six-year terms by [...] "common accord" [...] of governments, with the advice of seven EU or member state judges that the Council and Parliament selects. The Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, article 11, says the court is usually organised into chambers of 3 or 5 judges each. A [...] "grand chamber" [...] of 15 more senior judges sit on questions of [...] "difficulty or importance", or those requested by member states. The court's President and Vice-President are elected by other judges for renewable 3-year terms by secret ballot. Judges can only be dismissed if all other judges and Advocate Generals unanimously agree. Advocate Generals are appointed by the court to give reasoned submissions on cases, especially involving new points of law. Unlike judges on the Court, they write opinions as themselves, rather than collectively, and often with a command of prose and reason, and while not binding are often followed in practice. In addition, each judge has secretaries or referendaires who research and write. Unlike the UK where judges always write their own opinions, referendaires often assist drafting the judgments in the Court of Justice. The Court's Translation Directorate will translate every final judgment into the 24 official languages of the European Union. The three main kinds of judgments the Court of Justice gives following (1) preliminary rulings, requested by the courts of member states, (2) enforcement actions, brought by the Commission or Member States, against the EU, a member state, or any other party that is alleged to violate EU law, and (3) other direct actions, where the EU or member state is involved as {{a party to the}} dispute, and gives final rulings. The Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, modelled on the International Court of Justice, begin with submission of written cases to the court, followed by a short oral hearing. In each case a judge is designated to actively manage the hearing (called a rapporteur) and draft the judgment (probably with help from referendaires). The court always deliberates and votes before the final opinion is written and published. Cases in the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice on points of law. While there is no formal <b>appeal</b> <b>procedure</b> from the Court of Justice, in practice its actions are subject to scrutiny by both the supreme courts of member states and the European Court of Human Rights, even if the final balance of power is unresolved.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] The Annual Professional Performance Review (APPR) is the {{new teacher}} {{evaluation}} system adopted by New York State in 2012. Through APPR, each New York State teacher’s performance is evaluated annually. If a teacher is rated Ineffective, {{he or she must}} take part in a Teacher Improvement Plan (TIP). If a teacher is rated Ineffective for two consecutive years, the teacher may be dismissed even if that teacher has tenure. Given these potential consequences, the ability to appeal APPR ratings and how those ratings are conducted has been a major issue for teachers and their unions. Under New York Education Law 3012 -c, which establishes APPR, each school district negotiates its own APPR procedure with its local teachers union, including any procedures for appealing the performance review. This report examines the APPR <b>appeals</b> <b>procedures</b> established by school districts in order to investigate the following: Which aspects of the APPR process can teachers appeal? Who has the fi nal say in that appeals process? How much time do appeals processes take? Can teachers appeal APPR issues through the regular contractual grievance-arbitration procedure? This report addresses these questions by analyzing APPR <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures</b> for all New York State school districts. The data analyzed was gathered by coding the provisions of the APPR <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures,</b> which are publicly available on the New York State Department of Education website (1) ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures</b> for Nebraska {{property}} taxes are confusing. Amendments made to correct specific problems have, in turn, {{created their own}} problems. While taxpayers are technically provided due process by the existing procedures, practically they are not. The {{purpose of this article}} is to promote greater practical due process in Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s property tax <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures.</b> In achieving that purpose, this article analyzes Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s property tax <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures</b> for {{property taxes}} administered by the counties, shows how those procedures lack practical due process, and suggests several changes which would give practical due process to those paying property taxes in Nebraska. Lack of practical due process can shift the property tax burden to the homeowner and small business person. This article focuses on such taxpayers and the property taxes they pay to their local governments. To show that such taxpayers will find the cost of appealing their local property taxes difficult and costly, this article discusses the issues of valuation and equalization—how and when they must be raised if they are to be successfully argued. The article explains how a taxpayer may be assessed without the right to notice or protest when real property has been undervalued, and it discusses exemptions and the unique rules which apply. Finally, it explains when and how refunds may be obtained...|$|R
