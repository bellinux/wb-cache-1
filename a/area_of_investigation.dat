25|$|Premature aging syndromes {{including}} Werner syndrome, Ataxia telangiectasia, Ataxia-telangiectasia like disorder, Bloom syndrome, Fanconi anemia and Nijmegen breakage syndrome {{are associated}} with short telomeres. However, the genes that have mutated in these diseases all have roles in the repair of DNA damage and the increased DNA damage may, itself, {{be a factor in}} the premature aging (see DNA damage theory of aging). An additional role in maintaining telomere length is an active <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Where {{intrusive}} underwater excavation is appropriate, silts and sediments can {{be removed}} from an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> using a water dredge or airlift.

It is also important to note that for very deep sea excavation submarines are sometimes used to view sites. Underwater photography can also be conducted from these submarines which assists the recording process.|$|E

2500|$|The main HDS {{catalysts}} {{are based}} on molybdenum disulfide (...) together with smaller amounts of other metals.

[...] At {{the edges of the}} [...] crystallites, the molybdenum centre can stabilize a coordinatively unsaturated site (CUS), also known as an anion vacancy. [...] Substrates, such as thiophene, bind to this site and undergo a series of reactions that result in both C-S scission and C=C hydrogenation.

2500|$|New {{design of}} {{anti-bacterial}} medications is of continuing importance in scientific research as bacterial antibiotic resistance to common antibiotics increases. [...] A specific metabolic protein that uses FAD (Complex II) {{is vital for}} bacterial virulence, and so targeting FAD synthesis or creating FAD analogs could be a useful <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation.</b> Already, scientists have determined the two structures FAD usually assumes once bound: either an extended or a butterfly conformation, in which the molecule essentially folds in half, resulting in the stacking of the adenine and isoalloxazine rings. [...] FAD imitators {{that are able to}} bind in a similar manner but do not permit protein function could be useful mechanisms of inhibiting bacterial infection. [...] Alternatively, drugs blocking FAD synthesis could achieve the same goal; this is especially intriguing because human and bacterial FAD synthesis relies on very different enzymes, meaning that a drug made to target bacterial FAD synthase would be unlikely to interfere with the human FAD synthase enzymes.|$|E
