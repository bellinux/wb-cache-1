He pioneered the field of robust control with {{the solution of the}} gain margin and phase margin problems using techniques from Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation theory, which was the first H-infinity type control problem solved. Tannenbaum used techniques from elliptic curves to show that the reachability does not imply pole <b>assignability</b> for systems defined over polynomial rings in two or more variables over an arbitrary field. He pioneered the use of partial differential equations in computer vision and biomedical imaging co-inventing with Guillermo Sapiro an affine-invariant heat equation for image enhancement. Tannenbaum further formulated a new approach to optimal mass transport (Monge-Kantorovich) theory in joint work with Steven Haker and Sigurd Angenent. In recent work, he has developed techniques using graph curvature ideas for analyzing the robustness of complex networks.|$|E

These texts from the last 2500 years, states Terence Day, imply or recognize key elements in their theories of fair punishment: (1) the texts set a standard of Right, in order to define a violation that warrants punishment; (2) they discuss {{the possibility of a}} violation thereby defining a wrongdoing; (3) they discuss a theory of responsibility and <b>assignability</b> of a wrongdoing; (4) the texts discuss degrees of guilt, and therewith the form and severity of punishment must match the transgression; (5) they discuss approved and authorized forms of punishments and how these may be properly administered. The goal of punishment, in Hindu law, has been retributive and reformative. Hindu law, states Sarkar, developed the theory of punishment from its foundational theory of what it believed was necessary for the prosperity of the individual and a collection of individuals, of state and non-state.|$|E

On the one hand, the Canon Lawyers looked favorably on the products of labor, wages and profit, while holding suspect speculation, banking and finance. The Church discountenanced the fluctuations of wages and prices caused by the law of supply and demand. There was an attempt to maintain fixed standards of value. At the same time, there was a liberal and equitable view toward the old Roman idea of [...] "contract". The Church Courts invented and refined the idea of [...] "consideration" [...] the quid pro quo in modern contract. This was something that was lacking in Roman contract. Insurance, <b>assignability</b> and negotiability were developments in the Church Courts. These areas were largely ignored by the Common Law, or secular law of the day, especially in England (Plucknett p. 302,304).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{pole assignment}} control of nonlinear dynamic systems described by State Dependent Parameter (SDP) models. The approach follows from earlier research into linear Proportional-Integral-Plus (PIP) methods but, in SDP system control, the control coefficients are updated at each sampling instant {{on the basis}} of the latest SDP relationships. Alternatively, algebraic solutions can be derived off-line to yield a practically useful control algorithm that is relatively straightforward to implement on a digital computer, requiring only the storage of lagged system variables, coupled with straightforward arithmetic expressions in the control software. Although the analysis is limited to the case when the open-loop system has no zeros, time delays are handled automatically. The paper shows that the closed-loop system reduces to a linear transfer function with the specified (design) poles. Hence, assuming pole <b>assignability</b> at each sample, global stability of the nonlinear system is guaranteed at the design stage. The associated conditions for pole <b>assignability</b> are stated...|$|E

The theory not only sheds light on corporate subsidiaries, but illuminates a basic function of all types of legal entities, from partnerships to nonprofit corporations. We show that when, as is common, some of a firm’s key assets are contractual, both the firm’s owner(s) and the firm’s contractual counterparties are exposed to the risk of opportunism regarding assignment of the contracts. The owner faces opportunistic holdup by counterparties if counterparty consent is required to assign contracts in a sale of the entire firm. The firm’s counterparties, in turn, are exposed to opportunistic assignment if the owner can freely assign contracts without consent. This bilateral opportunism problem can be mitigated through bundled assignability: the owner is permitted to assign her contracts freely, but only as a bundle. The components of the bundle of contracts (which constitutes much of the firm itself) provide assurance of performance to counterparties. And free transferability, in turn, gives the owner liquidity without risk of holdup.

40|$|Assignment of Contract The {{purpose of}} this master's thesis is to analyze the <b>assignability</b> of {{contracts}} under Czech law {{in the light of}} comparative, historical and theoretical aspects of this phenomenon. Relevance of this subject matter was recently highlighted by adoption of the new Czech Civil Code, which expressly authorizes this operation but leaves important issues open to interpretation. The thesis is composed of an introduction, two main parts and a conclusion. First two chapters of the first part deal with historical development of this legal concept. In the roman law, a contractual obligation was conceived as a "bond of law" (iuris vinculum), which implied a strictly personal nature of this relationship. However, this view started to change as soon as the roman economy shifted from agriculture towards trade and business, resulting in <b>assignability</b> of a contractual right. In the codification era of the 19 th century, the concept of a delegation of contractual duty came in, establishing a theoretical foundation for the assignment of contract as such. The third chapter moves our attention to the modern times, focusing primarily on the assignement of contract in various European countries, United States and Japan.

We also ensure that <b>assignability,</b> precedence, and tool life constraints are met. Furthermore, the existing studies in the literature overlook the limited lives of the tools that are used for production.
