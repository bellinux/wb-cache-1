25|$|The Chichibabin {{pyridine}} synthesis {{was reported}} in 1924 and is still in use in industry. In its general form, the reaction {{can be described as}} a condensation reaction of aldehydes, ketones, α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, or any combination of the above, in ammonia or ammonia derivatives. In particular, unsubstituted pyridine is produced from formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, which are inexpensive and widely available. First, <b>acrolein</b> is formed in a Knoevenagel condensation from the acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. It is then condensed with acetaldehyde and ammonia into dihydropyridine, and then oxidized with a solid-state catalyst to pyridine. This process is carried out in a gas phase at 400–450°C. The product consists of a mixture of pyridine, simple methylated pyridines (picoline), and lutidine; its composition depends on the catalyst used and can be adapted {{to the needs of the}} manufacturer. The catalyst is usually a transition metal salt such as cadmium(II) fluoride or manganese(II) fluoride, but cobalt and thallium compounds can also be used.

One mirror image form (enantiomer) of a drug can have desirable activity, the other not. Consequently, the development of methods for the selective synthesis of one enantiomer is of great scientific and economic importance. We report here that a simple, commercially available chiral alcohol, α,α,α′,α′-tetraaryl- 1, 3 -dioxolane- 4, 5 -dimethanol (TADDOL), catalyzes the all-carbon Diels–Alder reactions of aminosiloxydienes and substituted <b>acroleins</b> to afford the products in good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 92 % enantiomeric excess). It is remarkable that the reactions are promoted by hydrogen bonding, the ubiquitous “glue” that helps to keep water molecules together and holds up the 3 D structures of proteins. Hydrogen bond catalysis is little used in chemical synthesis, wherein most reactions are promoted by complexes of Lewis acidic metal salts coordinated to chiral ligands. As it does for enzymes, hydrogen bonding not only organizes TADDOL into a well defined conformation, but, functioning as a Brønsted acid catalyst, it also activates the dienophile toward reaction with the diene.
