5|$|Spanish Florida <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> Province of Carolina {{were each}} {{subjected}} to attacks from the other, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> engaged the French based at Mobile {{in what was}} essentially a proxy war involving primarily allied American Indians on both sides. The southern war {{did not result in}} significant territorial changes, but it had the effect of nearly wiping out the Indian population of Spanish Florida, including parts of present-day southern Georgia, and destroying Spain's network of missions in the area.|$|E

5|$|By February King Stephen marched {{north to}} deal with David. The two armies avoided each other, and Stephen was soon on the road south. In the summer David split his army into two forces, sending William fitz Duncan to march into Lancashire, where he harried Furness and Craven. On 10 June, William fitz Duncan met a force of knights and men-at-arms. A pitched battle took place, the battle of Clitheroe, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> army was routed.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1643, most of the {{south-west}} {{was under}} Royalist control; only Plymouth, Poole and Lyme Regis held out against them. The Parliamentarians controlled the navy, and Lyme Regis was strategically important, due to its location between Bristol <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> Channel. In early 1644, Charles I ordered Lyme Regis to be captured, and sent a large force {{under the command of}} his nephew, Prince Maurice.|$|E

5|$|Cocker Spaniels are dogs {{belonging}} to two breeds of the spaniel dog type: the American Cocker Spaniel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> Cocker Spaniel, {{both of which}} are commonly called simply Cocker Spaniel in their countries of origin.

5|$|Ectropion is {{the outward}} rolling of the eyelid, which {{abnormally}} exposes the eye, resulting in irritation. Because {{of the increased}} exposure, the dog can develop allergic or bacterial conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis sicca also known as dry-eye syndrome.

5|$|Other factors {{contributed to}} the rising tensions. On his way to Egypt in 1798, Napoleon had stopped on the Island of Malta and {{forcibly}} removed the Hospitallers from their possessions.
