The souring of relations grows worse when he learns that in addition to almost having sex with Penny, Raj was writing love poems and fantasizing about Bernadette and him, which leads to Howard distrusting Bernadette and believing that she may cheat on him with Raj.|$|E

40|$|Research {{shows that}} over 20 % of deaths in Britain {{are due to}} heart-related diseases, making quick and {{accurate}} diagnosis of heart conditions extremely important. The ElectroCardioGram (ECG), a set of graphs of electrical heart activity, is the principle tool used in diagnosis of most heart conditions. However, not all problems can be found by a physician during a conventional ECG session; some conditions occur intermittently {{and will not be}} recorded during the short ECG measurement. There is a clear need for equipment which can record the patient's heart activity continuously {{over a longer period of}} time − 24 hours or more − to accurately diagnose intermittent heart problems. Portable, easy-to-use ECG equipment could monitor the patient, but at the same time allow them to live a normal life and visit hospital less frequently. Such equipment saves a healthcare organisation money in two ways: firstly by improving diagnosis, preventative action can be taken by the patient, allowing them to avoid time in hospital. Secondly, if the system includes automated software to look for abnormalities in the large amounts of ECG data created, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>doctor</b> time and therefore money can be saved.

40|$|Abstract — Breast cancer affects {{several people}} at present time. Diagnosis which determines whether the cancer is benign or {{malignant}} requires <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> effort from <b>doctors</b> and physician. Early diagnosis may save many lives. Accurate classification {{plays an important}} role in medical diagnosis. Genetic programming is a machine learning algorithm which now days excelling in classification field. But Genetic programming generally face the problem of code bloating in which an increase in average tree size is found without a corresponding increase in fitness. In this paper we are proposing a new technique for solving the problem of bloat and for increasing classification accuracy. The technique is known as intelligent crossover and mutation technique. This technique is a combination of hill climbing and conventional method which will be applied on both crossover and mutation operator. To demonstrate this, we had taken WBC dataset from UCI repository which has 2 classes and 9 features and we have compared classification accuracy of our method with standard crossover and FEDS crossover. Our classification accuracy was 96. 5 % for 50 - 50 training and testing methodology and 97. 6 % for 10 fold cross validation technique. This shows our method can be used for medical diagnosis as it provides good results...|$|R

[...] Initially, he considered putting oblique references to the show in his music but, aware of wizard rock bands like Harry and the Potters, decided to follow their model and create music dedicated to Doctor Who. [...] In June 2011 Kohn posted a notice on Facebook {{to see if anyone}} else was interested. [...] Dave Kitsberg responded to this post a few hours later and brought in Michael Fye.Kitsberg, now lead guitarist, wanted an appropriate custom guitar and turned to his friend and guitar-builder Chris Rice.

The Guardian said that [...] "Echo's 13 tracks, which were co-written by Justin Timberlake, OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder and other costly names, follow the formula of her debut: the slow, piano-accented build-up, punctuated by sharp intakes of breath and vocal curlicues, then the climactic {{explosion}} as the drums crash in and she hits the chorus. That voice is impressive enough and there's no denying the stolid catchiness of some songs – notably Happy and her cover of Oasis's Stop Crying Your Heart Out – but she appears to lack the lightness of touch this album desperately needs". Slant Magazine stated that [...] "...less compelling material, particularly in the album's second half, finds Lewis's talent squandered. The gooier adult contemporary numbers, of which [...] "I Got You" [...] is the worst, tend to add <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> unnecessary vocal <b>doctoring</b> to the mix, edging on the faceless robo-pop that has become all too ubiquitous {{in the age of}} Auto-Tune. And too much of the album's runtime is dominated by altogether thoughtless ballads, like the languid late-album duo of [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] and [...] "Don't Let Me Down," [...] in which Lewis confronts dull, piano-driven arrangements with vocals that, while technically unimpeachable, lack any warmth or emotional expression".|$|R
