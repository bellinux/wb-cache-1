Calcite (CCaCO 3 > 99 mole %) and kaolinite were formed as by-products of plagioclase <b>albitization.</b> Sodium-rich detrital plagioclase (An 2 -An,,) are usually unalbitized. Detritai K-feldspar is fresh or, rarely, partly albitized. Differences in <b>albitization</b> behavior ofdetrital plagioclase and K-feldspar are {{shown to be}} related to the chemistry of formation waters, reactivity of kaolinite, and temperature. The diagenetically formed albite pseudomorphs are very pure (Ab> 99), well-ordered low-albite, dark-luminescent, vacuolized, mostly untwinned, and comprised of numerous euhedral albite crystals. Some of the microporosity within the albite pseudomorphs is caused by volume reduction during <b>albitization</b> of the detritai plagioclase. The amount ofalbite formed in the pseudomorphs is related to the molar proportion of albite component in the detrital unstable Ca-rich plagioclase. The microporosity formed during <b>albitization</b> is proportional to the anorthite component, which is believed to have dissolved and resulted primarily in the formation of calcite and kaolinite. The <b>albitization</b> of detfital plagioclase in the studied sandstones can thus be explained without assuming the consumption ofsignificant amounts ofNa + from pore solutions...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACt: Observations of closely spaced porous and {{cemented}} sandstones {{from the}} San Joaquin basin, the Los Angeles basin and the Gulf Coast reveal that <b>albitization</b> of plagioclase occurs during fracturing of the detrital plagioclase grains. <b>Albitization</b> {{is found to}} be a chemically selective hydrous reaction in which An-rich plagioclase is preferentially albitized first relative to An-poor plagioclase. The observed non-positive volume change during <b>albitization</b> i dicates that aluminum obility takes place on a scale at least as large as a thin section. These findings are supported by thermodynamic stability calculations for plagioclase with different compositions and degrees of aluminum-silicon rdering at 25 "(7 in a representative seawater and at 100 °C in an oil field water. The calculations predict that 1) An-rich plagioclase is less stable than An-poor plagioclase, and 2) plagioclase with a random AI/Si distribution is less stable than plagioclase with the same composition but an ordered AI/Si distribution. Any composition and structural state of plagioclase, including albite, is unstable in sea water at 25 "(7. The width of the <b>albitization</b> zone may be controlled by the degree of aluminum-silicon rdering.

40|$|International audienceThe Salvezines Massif in {{northern}} French Pyrénées has undergone extensive <b>albitization.</b> The massif consists of gneisses and a leucogranite hosted in Paleozoic sediments (schists and carbonates). The leucogranite was emplaced {{at the end}} of the Hercynian orogeny. The granite underwent monazite fractionation during magmatic stages, which induced lowering of REE and Th contents in the most evolved rocks. Hydrothermal alteration during late magmatic stages is also identified through the development of a tetrad effect in the REE patterns of the granite and through the fractionation of ratios like Zr/Hf out of the CHARAC (CHarge RAdius Controlled) range. The granite underwent partial to complete sub-solidus <b>albitization.</b> Progressive metasomatic overprint induced metasomatic replacement of feldspars into albite and dissolution of quartz (episyenitization) together with new albite formation. Hydrothermal muscovite with a sheaf-like structure sometimes crystallised in albitites. Inherited muscovites from magmatic stage and newly formed muscovites from albitites have distinct chemical compositions with the latter being much more phengitic. The initial peraluminous chemistry of the leucogranite was lost during <b>albitization</b> and composition evolved towards a pure albite one (A/CNK = 1). <b>Albitization</b> induced gains in Na and Al, and losses in Si and K. Leaching of REE and U is also identified during <b>albitization,</b> as well as the non-CHARAC behaviour of some elements. d 18 O values of quartz and muscovite in albitized granites are in the magmatic range (about 12 and 9. 5 , respectively). Feldspars acquired high d 18 O values during <b>albitization</b> (up to 15 ). Muscovite grains from albitites have higher d 18 O values than inherited ones and tend towards isotopic equilibrium with albite. The albitizing fluids have interacted with high-d 18 O rocks (probably local carbonates) prior to alter granite. Muscovites inherited from magmatic stages display very characteristic disturbed 39 Ar­ 40 Ar age spectra with saddle-shapes when a muscovite associated with <b>albitization</b> provided a plateau age at 117. 5 Ma for this alteration event. <b>Albitization</b> in the Salvezines Massif just preceded the regional talc/chlorite hydrothermal mineralization.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Formation waters from clastic {{reservoirs}} offshore Norway are saturated or supersaturated {{with respect}} to albite deeper than 2. 5 km, and support the view of Saigal et al.

Thermodynamic and mass constraints show that the <b>albitization</b> process is more sensitive to potassium removal than sodium supply. The temperature of <b>albitization</b> commencement coincides more or less with the estimated onset temperature of illitization of smectite (70 - 80 °C).

40|$|Major- and trace-element {{contents}} and Sr-Nd isotope ratios were determined in albitite, albitized and unaltered late-Variscan granitoid {{samples from the}} world-class Na-feldspar deposits of central Sardinia, Italy. The albite deposit of high economic grade has geological, textural, and chemical features typical of metasomatic alteration affecting the host granitoids. <b>Albitization,</b> locally accompanied by chloritization and epidotization, was characterized by strong leaching of Mg, Fe, K, and geochemically similar trace elements, and by a significant increase of Na. Ca, and P were moderately leached in the most metasomatized rocks. Other major (Si, Ti, Ca) and trace elements (U, Th, Y, and Zr), along with light (LREE) and middle (MREE) rare-earth elements, behaved essentially immobile at the deposit scale. The Nd-isotope ratios (0. 512098 to 0. 512248) do not provide information on the emplacement age of the unaltered late-Variscan granitoids. On the other hand, their Sr-isotope ratios fit an errorchron of 274 +/- 29 Ma (1 -? error), in fair agreement with all published ages of Sardinian Variscan granitoids. The very low Rb content of albitized rocks precludes application of the Rb-Sr radiometric system to determine the age of <b>albitization.</b> The Sm-Nd system is not applicable either, because the 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios of albitized rocks and unaltered granitoids overlap. The overlap confirms that Sm and Nd were substantially immobile during <b>albitization.</b> On the other hand, the measured 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of the albitized rocks are appreciably {{lower than those of}} the unaltered host granitoids, whereas, their initial Sr-isotope ratios are higher. This seems to suggest that a) <b>albitization</b> was induced by non-magmatic fluids rich in radiogenic Sr, and b) <b>albitization</b> occurred shortly after the granitoid emplacement. This conclusion is supported by Nd isotopes, because unaltered granitoids and albitites fit the same reference isochron at 274 Ma. The fluids acquired radiogenic Sr by circulation through the Lower Paleozoic metasedimentary basement. Specifically, it is estimated that Sr supplied by the non-carbonatic basement represents about 22 wt% of total Sr in albitite...|$|E

The concentrations of metals in solution are less than in similar experiments with natural brine but greater than in seawater after eaction with graywacke. Metal mobilization depends primarily on acidity which was produced by Na metasomatism and by dedolomitization. In sharp contrast, reaction of 4 m NaC 1 with basalt produced only minor alteration in which some smectite and little albite formed.

Among the diverse ore deposits found within the belt, a set of Sb-(±Au) deposits are located in a major quartz-carbonate altered brittle-ductile structure known as the Antimony Line. The Antimony Line is thus clearly related to hydrothermal fluid circulation. In this study, we focus on albitites that run along the Antimony Line.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Albitization</b> is {{a common}} metasomatic process active in various geodynamic contexts. In the {{northern}} Pyrenees, there are several occurrences of albitites but, until now, only one occurrence has been dated (117 Ma, Ar–Ar dating). This paper presents new U–Th–Pb ages for several albitite occurrences throughout the Pyrenees to test whether they are contemporaneous and, if so, to specify the regional extent of the <b>albitization</b> event. Ages obtained from large euhedral titanite and monazite grains from distinct albitites are 110 8 and 98 2 Ma, respectively. The zircon U–Th–Pb isotopic system did not record this Cretaceous metasomatic event, even when grains were selected in metasomatically Zr-enriched rocks or in hydrothermal structures (millimetre-sized veins cross-cutting granitoids). We argue that the total time span of 20 Ma recorded by albitites corresponds to a long-lived hydrothermal system that was active during the rotation of Iberia around Europe, along the North Pyrenean Fault. Because <b>albitization</b> and talc mineralization have the same spatial and temporal distribution in the Pyrenees, we argue that these two metasomatic phenomena are two independent records of this single, regional-scale, long-lived hydrothermal system. Like many other orogenic belts, the Pyrenees recorded numerous fluid–rock interaction events. Fluids are documented within ductile shear zones (e. g. McCaig et al. 1990) as a metasomati...|$|E
40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. Iron Oxide Copper Gold (IOCG) deposits are {{the products of}} crustal-scale metasomatic alteration, {{generally considered to be}} associated with the emplacement of large felsic intrusions. These systems are typified by zoned, broad alteration haloes comprising the products of an early, barren <b>albitization</b> event, and late, ore-hosting potassic/calcic (skarn) alteration associated with mineralization. Yttrium and rare earth elements (REY), and also uranium, are prominent components of most IOCG systems. The REY-signatures of feldspars and accessory apatite, Fe-(Ti) -oxides and other minerals are geochemical tracers of alteration stages within a magmatic-hydrothermal system. This study sets out to identify links between magmatism and initiation of hydrothermal activity, and to test the hypothesis that <b>albitization</b> is a pre-requisite stage for REE-U enrichment in magmatically-derived IOCG systems. The compositions and trace element concentrations in key minerals have been analysed using scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis and laser-ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry in a varied range of magmatic to metasedimentary lithologies from the Moonta-Wallaroo region, an area in which broad regional-scale alkali alteration is recognised. Results confirm a strong link between <b>albitization</b> and REE-U-enrichment. The process of <b>albitization</b> is seen to consume, redistribute and lock-in REY, LILE and HFSE via complex fluid-rock reactions dependent on the pre-existing mineral assemblages and fluid characteristics, providing a holistic model for IOCG-driven alkali metasomatism. The trace element signatures recorded by K-feldspar reflect a transition from magmatic to hydrothermal stages within an evolving IOCG system. Although further constraints on these signatures are required, they could prove invaluable in mineral exploration as they suggest a quantifiable distinction between alteration associated with mineralization, and regional background. This hypothesis requires testing elsewhere in the Olympic Province and in analogous terranes. Thesis (B. Sc. (Hons)) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Physical Sciences, 201...|$|E

40|$|<b>Albitization</b> is {{a common}} process during which {{hydrothermal}} fluids convert plagioclase and/or K-feldspar into nearly pure albite; however, its specific mechanism in granitoids is not well understood. The c. 1700 Ma A-type metaluminous ferroan granites in the Khetri complex of Rajasthan, NW India, have been albitized {{to a large extent}} by two metasomatic fronts, an initial transformation of oligoclase to nearly pure albite and a subsequent replacement of microcline by albite, with sharp contacts between the microcline-bearing and microcline-free zones. <b>Albitization</b> has bleached the original pinkish grey granite and turned it white. The mineralogical changes include transformation of oligoclase (∼An 12) and microcline (∼Or 95) to almost pure albite (∼An 0 · 5 - 2), amphibole from potassian ferropargasite (XFe 0 · 84 - 0 · 86) to potassic hastingsite (XFe 0 · 88 - 0 · 97) and actinolite (XFe 0 · 32 - 0 · 67), and biotite from annite (XFe 0 · 71 - 0 · 74) to annite (XFe 0 · 90 - 0 · 91). Whole-rock isocon diagrams show that, during <b>albitization,</b> the granites experienced major hydration, slight gain in Si and major gain in Na, whereas K, Mg, Fe and Ca were lost along with Rb, Ba, Sr, Zn, light rare earth elements and U. Whole-rock Sm-Nd isotope data plot on an apparent isochron of 1419 [*]±[*] 98 Ma and reveal significant disturbance and at least partial resetting of the intrusion age. Severe scatter in the whole-rock Rb-Sr isochron plot reflects the extreme Rb loss in the completely albitized samples, effectively freezing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in the albite granites at very high values (0 · 725 - 0 · 735). This indicates either infiltration of highly radiogenic Sr from the country rock or, more likely, radiogenic ingrowth during a considerable time lag (estimated to be at least 300 Myr) between original intrusion and <b>albitization.</b> The <b>albitization</b> took place at ∼ 350 - 400 °C. It was caused by the infiltration of an ascending hydrothermal fluid that had acquired high Na/K and Na/Ca ratios during migration through metamorphic rocks at even lower temperatures in the periphery of the plutons. Oxygen isotope ratios increase from δ 18 O[*]=[*] 7 ‰ in the original granite to values of 9 - 10 ‰ in completely albitized samples, suggesting that the fluid had equilibrated with surrounding metamorphosed crust. A metasomatic model, using chromatographic theory of fluid infiltration, explains the process for generating the observed zonation in terms of a leading metasomatic front where oligoclase of the original granite is converted to albite, and a second, trailing front where microcline is also converted to albite. The temperature gradients driving the fluid infiltration may have been produced by the high heat production of the granites themselves. The confinement of the albitized granites along the NE-SW-trending Khetri lineament and the pervasive nature of the <b>albitization</b> suggest that the albitizing fluids possibly originated during reactivation of the lineament.

Whole-rock geochemical data indicate nearly immobile Al, Ga, ±Ti, Zr during transformation of a variety of least altered rocks toward albitite. The data indicate that the addition of Na from a brine to the rock accompanied the loss of Fe, K, Ba, Rb ± Ca, Sr, Co, V, Mn, Pb, and Zn from those altered rocks and enrichment in the brine, but that Cu was not systematically stripped from a variety of wall rocks during <b>albitization.</b> Conversely, the formation of metasomatic ironstones, the immediate hosts to some Cu-Au ores, involves addition of most of the same elements that were lost during <b>albitization.</b> The correlation between intensity of alteration, its distribution and timing (e. g., in breccias cored by ca. 1530 – 1500 Ma granitoids), and convergence of all rock types toward magmatic stable isotope values provides strong evidence for a substantial component of igneous-derived fluid. Simulations of the <b>albitization</b> process were carried out isothermally at 550 °C and 350 MPa and polythermally from these conditions down to 400 °C and 200 MPa, using the Gibbs minimization method with HCh software and the UNITHERM database. Both simple fluid-rock mixing models and more complicated reactor-style algorithms used a range of input fluids (from fluids equilibrated fluid with two-feldspar granite through to Na/K ratios consistent with fluid inclusion results) and geochemical data for initially unaltered wall rocks. The apparent paradox of widespread <b>albitization</b> resulting from fluid released by two-feldspar granites can be explained by relatively small shifts away from the K-feldspar-albite equilibrium curve, and even isothermal model fluids derived from two-feldspar granites produce albitites in calc-silicate rocks outboard of granite-proximal K-feldspar-clinopyroxene skarns, matching field patterns. Those models with fluid Na/K ratios similar to those of fluid inclusions produced the most realistic alteration assemblages, dominated by albite, for both isothermal conditions and decreasing temperature, which approximate those observed in the field. PIXE and microthermometric data on fluid inclusions from quartz in two-feldspar quartz monzonite and pegmatite {{at the top of the}} Mount Angelay pluton indicate bulk Na/K molar ratios in the fluid of between 10 and 20, considerably higher than our thermodynamically calculated values for fluid in equilibrium with two-feldspar granite of around 3 (at 550 °C, 350 MPa). Such shifts may have been attained by admixture of magmatic-hydrothermal fluid with small amounts of NaCl brines trapped along grain boundaries in scapolite-bearing calc-silicate wall rocks, by fluid immiscibility due to high initial CO 2 contents in the felsic intrusions, by contributions from mafic magmas, or from dissolution of salt-rich layers into the intrusions prior to crystallization and fluid release. With increasing amounts of fluid-rock interaction in the models, the fluids were enriched in K, Fe, and Ca, approaching compositions observed in fluid inclusions in the ore deposits. These fluids, reacted with pelitic rocks (which are common ore hosts), would produce magnetite-clinopyroxene ± biotite-actinolite alteration at high temperature, similar to the proximal alteration around ore deposits. We infer that precipitation of sulfides in the Cu-Au deposits was the result of mixing of Cu-bearing brine, of ultimately magmatic origin, but modified extensively via <b>albitization,</b> with sulfur-bearing fluids or reaction of the brine with sulfur-bearing rocks. When Cu was absent from the initial magmatic fluid, barren ironstones may have been the result...|$|E

Muscovite schists adjacent to albitites were altered to albite-bearing biotite-rich schists.

They are characterised by overall <b>albitization,</b> chloritisation and haematisation. Albite and chlorite constitute their characteristic mineral paragenesis. Haematite pigmentation comes with this paragenesis and gives an overall pink coloration to the weathered rocks. A paleomagnetic analysis was conducted after detailed petrographical and mineralogical studies of the alteration that lead to the albitized profiles. Special attention was devoted to the occurrence of haematite, the main paleomagnetism carrier, with the though to date this palaeoweathering event. Petrographical checking after heating treatments showed that deshydroxylation of chlorite also led to the formation of secondary haematite. This haematite formed by recrystallization acquired remanence properties and thus superimposed and hided the original magnetic signal. This problem has prevented the extraction of the original magnetic signal especially in the sections made up of rhyolites. Virtual Geomagnetic Poles (VGPs) obtained from the characteristic directions carried by haematite have been compared to the European Apparent Polar Wander Path (APWP). An Early Triassic magnetic overprint has been recorded in the albitized basement rocks of the Morvan massif. The age obtained for this <b>albitization</b> phenomena, strengthens the hypothesis that <b>albitization</b> developed in relation with palaeoweathering processes linked with the Triassic palaeosurface. Therefore, large scale continental weathering could be the main mechanism for Late Permian/Early Triassic remagnetizations which are widespread throughout the Palaeozoic formations of western Europe.

Analysis of Paleogene medium-deep sandstones on the Huanghekou Sag provides insight into relating the diagenetic processes to pore fluid property evolution influenced by volcanic activities. Three distinct types of pore fluids were identified {{on the basis of}} an integrated and systematic analysis including core and thin section observation, XRD, SEM, CL, and trace element. Alkaline aqueous medium environment occurred in E 2 s 1 + 2 where volcanic activities have in{{significant influence on}} pore fluids, evidenced by typical alkaline diagenetic events such as K-feldspar <b>albitization,</b> quartz dissolution, feldspar dissolution, and carbonate cementation. During the deposition of E 3 d 3, influx of terrestrial freshwater and alteration of ferromagnesian-rich pore water result in the formation of mixing aqueous medium environment through volcanic eruption dormancy causing zeolite dissolution, clay mineral transformation, and K-feldspar <b>albitization.</b> Ferromagnesian-rich aqueous medium environment developed resulting from the intensive hydrolysis of the unstable ferromagnesian minerals formed due to intense volcanic activities during E 3 d 1 + 2 and corresponding predominant diagenetic processes were characterized by the precipitation and dissolution of low-silica zeolites. Therefore, the differential properties of pore fluids caused various diagenetic processes controlling reservoir quality...|$|E

We have estimated the physiochemical conditions of each event. The magmatic-hydothermal processes {{can be divided into}} 3 stages: main magmatic stage, late magmatic stage and post magmatic stage. During the late magmatic stage there was interactions between melt, already crystallised rock forming minerals and aqueous phases.

30|$|The {{computerized}} geochemical modeling, {{a useful}} tool to understand the diagenetic processes influencing the quality of hydrocarbon reservoirs, is performed by using different modules of computer codes based on the thermodynamic and chemical kinetic principles and their associated parameters. As observed in the reservoir lithofacies deposited from the marine sediment-gravity flows, {{a case study of}} diagenesis is presented here from the Espírito Santo Basin in southeastern Brazil. The study uses the Geochemist’s Workbench (GWB™), PHREEQC™ and TOUGHREACT™ computation packages. The comparison of performances of these packages demonstrates the convergence of results from the software-based geochemical modeling with the petrographic observation of dissolution, <b>albitization,</b> kaolinization, and the precipitation of calcite and dolomite. Moreover, with limited data points, e.g., the sedimentary petrographic data acquired from limited number of boreholes, the computer simulation establishes itself to be a powerful quantitative method estimating the degree and type of diagenetic alteration of turbidite reservoir bodies in contact with a source of saline-water influx associated with salt tectonics. Therefore, using the limited petrographic data points, the geochemical computer-simulation method can even be utilized and extrapolated for areas where similar geological context is interpreted but no borehole data are available. Hence, porosity of turbidite reservoir lithofacies can be predicted in relation to the spatial distribution of dissolution, kaolinization, and <b>albitization</b> of feldspars and authigenic carbonate precipitation.|$|E
30|$|With {{implications}} in reservoir modelling and petroleum-system modeling (or basin modeling), {{the ultimate}} objectives of geochemical modeling are to demonstrate: (1) The sequential stages of diagenetic changes (e.g., the alteration processes of detrital feldspars, i.e., <b>albitization</b> and kaolinization, the quartz overgrowth cementation, and the authigenic growth of calcite and dolomite in the pore {{spaces of the}} reservoir); and (2) The time-window variations with distances from the reaction front to achieve the chemical equilibria within the analogous stratigraphic contexts. The evaluation of three-dimensional spatial variation of petrophysical properties due to diagenesis is not {{the intent of this}} article.|$|E
40|$|The {{samples of}} partly or {{completely}} altered basaltic extrusive rocks from Mt. Medvednica ophiolite mélange were analysed by the optical microscopy and by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The chemical composition of minerals from different paragenetic assembleges were determinated by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and the measured microdomains were documented by back-scattered electrons (BSE) imagery. The most widespread alteration processes that affected analysed rocks are <b>albitization,</b> chloritization, epidotization, prehnitization, pumpellyitization, zeolitization and titanitization. Subordinate processes that include formation of limonite, calcite, zoisite, siderite, hematite, Mn-oxydes, pyrite and SiO 2 -phases were not constrained in this paper. <b>Albitization</b> is fairly dominant alteration process in all rock and its progradation throughout a plagioclase grain is clearly documented by BSE microphotographs and microprobe chemical analysis. Prehnite and laumontite are sporadic alteration products of plagioclases. The chemical components released during the alterations of plagioclases and/or clinopyroxenes along with components from circulating and percolating heated see water and fluids enable formation of chlorites, epidote and pumpellyite. Chlorites and pumpellyite formed also by devitrification of volcanic glass in vitric rim of pillow lavas. Small patches of leucoxene, that is abundant in all samples, represent dense aggregates of titanite nanocrystals replacing ilmenite and/or Ti-magnetite. Epidote-bearing paragenesis in the analyzed rocks record comparatively the highest alterations grade {{that correspond to}} the middle grade of greenschist facies metamorphism typical of upper sequence of a see floor crust (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the Pyrenees, in {{association}} with the rotation of the Iberian plate around Europe during the Mid- Cretaceous, a Na-Ca metasomatism is recognized as a complementary record of the hydrothermal activity that led to Na-metasomatism (<b>albitization)</b> and talc-chlorite mineralization. It affected metasedimentary rocks as well as Hercynian granites. In situ laser ablation ICP-MS U-Pb analyses of titanite grains formed in albitites during metasomatism date the Na-Ca metasomatism between 110 and 92 Ma. The temperature of the Na-Ca metasomatism is estimated to be approximately 550 °C. Both the time constraints and temperature estimates suggest that the Na-Ca metasomatism is related to the low-P high-T North Pyrenean metamorphism...|$|E

Various degrees of contamination by assimilation of country rock (biotite granite and granodiorite) {{are responsible for the}} development of mineralogically distinct quartz episyenites. Two episodes of K-metasomatism and <b>albitization</b> define distinct alteration trends reminiscent of the alteration trends in the Cornish and French Hercynean leucogranites. Trace element characteristics correspond with those of mineralized granitoids of alkaline series. Geochemical characteristics show correspondences with anorogenic alkaline, peralkaline, and A-type granites. The Rb-Zr and Y-contents of the alkali feldspar granite and hydrothermally altered rocks support a within-plate genetic model. -Author...|$|E
40|$|Groundwater {{samples from}} buried hill of Jizhong Depression were {{evaluated}} using two statistical analyses: hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and {{principal component analysis}} (PCA). The samples were classified into four clusters, C 1 –C 4, in HCA and the hydrochemical types of C 1 –C 4 are HCO 3 -Na, Cl·HCO 3 -Na, Cl-Na, and Cl-Na·Ca. From C 1 to C 2, C 3, and C 4, the water-rock interaction becomes increasingly intensive, and rNa/rCl gets lower while total dissolved solids and r(Cl-Na) /rMg get higher. Three components of PCA explain 86. 87 % of the variance. Component 1 (PC 1), characterized by highly positive loadings in Na+ and Cl−, is related to evaporation concentration. Component 2 (PC 2) is defined by highly positive loading in HCO 3 - and is related to influence of atmospheric water. With high positive loadings in Ca 2 + and high negative loadings in Na+ and SO 42 -, component 3 (PC 3) suggests plagioclase <b>albitization.</b> The combination of HCA and PCA within the hydrogeological contexts allowed the division of study area into five dynamic areas. From recharge area to discharge area, the influence of atmospheric water gets weaker and water-rock interactions such as evaporation concentration and plagioclase <b>albitization</b> become intensive. Therefore groundwater in buried hill showed paths of hydrochemical evolution, from C 1, to C 2, C 3, and C 4. Buried hill reservoir in Jizhong Depression is mainly distributed in hydrodynamic blocking and discharge area; therefore the two regions can be the favorable areas for petroleum migration...|$|E
40|$|The Miocene magmatic {{intrusion}} in the Tavşanlı {{zone of the}} Kütahya-Bolkardağ Belt (KBB) in the northwestern region of Turkey {{is represented by the}} Eğrigöz granitoids. This paper studies the petrology and geochemistry of hydrothermal alterations associated with the vein-type Cu-Pb-Zn mineralization hosted by this pluton, focusing on the determination of the mass gains and losses of chemical components, which reflect the chemical exchanges between the host rocks and hydrothermal fluids. Vein-type Cu-Pb-Zn mineralization is closely associated with intense hydrothermal alterations within the brecciation, quartz stockwork veining, and brittle fracture zones that are controlled by NW-SE trending faults cutting through the Eğrigöz granitoids. Paragenetic relationships reveal three stages of mineralization: pre-ore, ore, and supergene. The ore mineralogy typically includes hypogene chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, and pyrite, with locally supergene covellite, malachite, and azurite. Wall-rock hypogene hydrothermal alterations include pervasive silicification, sulfidation, sericitization, and selective carbonatization and <b>albitization.</b> These are distributed in three main alteration zones (zone 1 : silicified/iron carbonatized alterations ± albite, zone 2 : argillic-silicic alterations, and zone 3 : phyllic alterations). Based on the gains and losses of mass and volume (calculated by the GEOISO-Windows™ program), zone 1 has a higher mass and volume gain than zones 2 and 3. Non-systematic zonal distributions of alterations are observed in which the silicic-carbonate alterations +/− <b>albitization</b> appeared in zone 1 in the center and the phyllic-argillic alterations appeared in zones 2 and 3, with an increase in base metals (Cu-Pb-Zn) in the zone from Cu, Cu-Pb, to Cu-Pb-Zn moving outwards...|$|E

The convection of fluids derived from the subjacent shales and carbonates through fracture systems along/around the wall of salt dome promoted the development of hot brine fluids with high Na+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cl−, and SO 42 − activities. The most evident consequence of the action of these fluids {{in the vicinity of}} salt dome is extensive <b>albitization</b> of the detrital feldspar grains in the sandstone beds, particularly of the twinned plagioclase and the orthoclase grains (Fig. 3 a-h and section 3.2; de Oliveira et al. 2018).|$|E
