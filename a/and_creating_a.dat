5|$|Authorized by the Kentucky General Assembly {{and signed}} by Governor Bert Combs on March 6, 1962, a mandate was placed upon the University of Kentucky to form a {{community}} college system. Two years later, the Board of Trustees implemented the legislation and established the Community College System, recharacterizing the centers in Northern Kentucky, Ashland, Fort Knox, Cumberland, Henderson <b>and</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> new campus in Elizabethtown. The Ashland Center of the University of Kentucky was renamed the Ashland Community College.|$|E
5|$|Hydrochloric acid is {{used for}} {{a large number of}} {{small-scale}} applications, such as leather processing, purification of common salt, household cleaning, and building construction. Oil production may be stimulated by injecting hydrochloric acid into the rock formation of an oil well, dissolving a portion of the rock, <b>and</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> large-pore structure. Oil well acidizing is a common process in the North Sea oil production industry.|$|E

5|$|The motmots have {{colorful}} plumage and long, graduated tails {{which they}} display by waggling back and forth. In {{most of the}} species, the barbs near {{the ends of the}} two longest (central) tail feathers are weak and fall off, leaving a length of bare shaft <b>and</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> racket-shaped tail.|$|E
5|$|A Nightmare on Elm Street was {{originally}} {{going to follow}} the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, Friday the 13th, with the writers taking what they thought were the best elements {{from each of the}} films <b>and</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline, and try to create a scarier film. That being, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring him back to a darker nature; this included developing the character as a true child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead.|$|E
5|$|Annually, Manila is {{hit with}} 5 to 7 typhoons {{creating}} floods. In 2009, Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy) struck the Philippines. In its aftermath, {{the lack of}} infrastructure led {{to one of the}} worst floodings in the Philippines <b>and</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> significant amount of pollution. Following the aftermath of Typhoon Ketsana, the city began to dredge its rivers and improve its drainage network. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission is in charge of cleaning up the Pasig River and tributaries for transportation, recreation and tourism purposes. Rehabilitation efforts have resulted in the creation of parks along the riverside, along with stricter pollution controls.|$|E

5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward <b>and</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the {{crossing}} {{resulted in the}} closure of the QEW until a temporary bridge was erected. To remedy what was becoming a major delay and hazard, the Department of Highways began planning a high-level bridge to cross the shipping channel. To provide better access to the new structure as well as the proposed Chedoke Expressway, construction began on the Freeman Diversion, bypassing the old trumpet interchange <b>and</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> new three-level stack. Work on both proceeded over the next six years.|$|E
5|$|Eggman enacts more {{malicious}} schemes {{based on}} holidays like Christmas, Valentine's Day, and St. Patrick's Day, Afterwards, he temporarily fires Decoe and Bocoe and creates replacements, Dukow and Bukow, who kidnap Sonic {{and give him}} to an organization called S.O.N.I.C.X. Sonic escapes with ease, but S.O.N.I.C.X. repeatedly tries to ruin his reputation. Meanwhile, the animals take on Eggman in his various schemes—including becoming a wrestler <b>and</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> circus—to keep the Emeralds from him. In the final issue, a crossover with {{the continuity of the}} main comic series, that continuity's Metal Sonic appears and allies with Eggman to defeat Sonic, but that continuity's version of Shadow steps in and warps himself and Metal Sonic to another dimension, leading into the events of the first issue of Sonic Universe.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, the United States Supreme Court {{ruled the}} Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 unconstitutional. For the first time, Minton gave speeches criticizing {{the court for}} {{overriding}} the will of Congress. He accused the court of allowing itself {{to be influenced by}} political motives rather than the law. In response to the court ruling, Minton began drafting a bill which would allow the Supreme Court to declare a law unconstitutional only if seven out the nine justices supported the decision. In February 1937, before Minton introduced his bill, President Roosevelt introduced a plan of his own to deal with the Supreme Court. Roosevelt proposed adding more justices to the court <b>and</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> mandatory retirement age; the changes would allow him to appoint an overwhelming majority to the court, more sympathetic to his agenda, ensuring the safety of legislation passed by his party.|$|E
5|$|In March 1971 South Vietnamese forces, {{supported}} by U.S. air power, launched Operation Lam Son 719, the long-awaited offensive {{to cut the}} Ho Chi Minh trail in southeastern Laos. However, {{the result was a}} failure. North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces had already begun to expand the trail system westward, pushing Royal Lao forces toward the Mekong, slowly extending the territory it controlled, moving west of the trail <b>and</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> larger buffer zone between its logistical system and the South Vietnamese. After Lam Son 719, that process accelerated. Hanoi's effort was simplified {{by the fact that the}} Royalist forces in the south had little experience fighting PAVN and they were quickly overwhelmed. Inept and ineffective were terms utilized to describe their defense. On 30 April 1971 the key town of Attopeu was seized by the communists.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} year of operation, Anacostia tied with the Capitol Heights station for the most auto thefts (17) at any Metro station, and {{accounted}} for 11.3 percent of all auto thefts at Metrorail stations. By 2005, large crowds of {{middle and high school}} students began congregating at the Anacostia Station, brawling and robbing Metro riders <b>and</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> public safety issue. Metro Transit Police officers, some accompanied by dogs, began patrolling Anacostia, Gallery Place–Chinatown, L'Enfant Plaza, and three other Metro stations to increase awareness of police presence in the stations and deter crime.|$|E

5|$|Louis Prang {{was born}} 12 March 1824 in Breslau. At {{the age of}} 13 he began apprenticing for his father and learned to dye and print calico, as well as wood and metal engraving. Prang emigrated to Boston in 1850 and became an {{illustrator}} {{for a number of}} local publications. Starting a business partnership in 1856 to manufacture copper and lithographic plates, Prang became sole proprietor in 1860 and named the company L. Prang & Co. He specialized in color printing, more specifically “chromolithography” Prang spent over four decades studying <b>and</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> standard of colors and engraved and printed maps, prints of contemporary celebrities, and color reproductions of famous works of art.|$|E
5|$|NY9N was {{extended}} south to Lake George in March1936, supplanting both NY47 and NY195 {{in an effort}} to aid tourists. From Westport to Hague, NY9N overlapped with NY22 (from Westport to Ticonderoga) and NY8 (from Crown Point to Hague). The route {{was extended}} once more in November1953 to its current southern terminus in Saratoga Springs, replacing NY9K <b>and</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> short overlap with US9 through Lake George village in the process. The overlap with NY8 was eliminated in the mid-1960s when that route was truncated to end at its junction with NY9N in Hague.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1943, the Western Allies {{invaded the}} Italian mainland, {{following}} Italy's armistice with the Allies. Germany {{with the help}} of fascists responded by disarming Italian forces that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas, <b>and</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> series of defensive lines. German special forces then rescued Mussolini, who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy named the Italian Social Republic, causing an Italian civil war. The Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the main German defensive line in mid-November.|$|E

5|$|The flow of {{the river}} has {{decreased}} in power in recent years, partly because of surface run-off in the upper catchment of the Hazel Brook, especially from the large retail centre at Cribbs Causeway, which sends {{a good deal of}} silt into the system, slowing the flow <b>and</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> risk of flooding downstream. This problem has now been partially alleviated by the construction of the Catbrain attenuation reservoir near Cribbs Causeway. Measurements of pollution by the city council show the water to be relatively clean.|$|E
5|$|The idea to do a film {{adaptation}} of Susan Orlean's The Orchid Thief {{dates back to}} 1994. Fox 2000 purchased the film rights in 1997, eventually selling them to Jonathan Demme, who set the project at Columbia Pictures. Charlie Kaufman was hired to write the script, but struggled with the adaptation and writer's block. Kaufman eventually created a script of his experience in adaptation, exaggerating events, <b>and</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> fictional brother named Donald Kaufman. Kaufman put Donald Kaufman's name on the script and dedicated the film to the fictional character. By September 1999, Kaufman had written two drafts of the script; he turned in a third draft in November 2000.|$|E
