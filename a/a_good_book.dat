5|$|Over {{the field}} seasons of 1924 and 1925, Wheeler ran {{excavations}} of the Roman fort of Y Gaer near Brecon, a project aided {{by his wife}} and two archaeological students, Nowell Myres and Christopher Hawkes. During this project, he was visited by the prominent Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie and his wife Hilda Petrie; Wheeler greatly admired Petrie's emphasis on strong archaeological methodologies. Wheeler published the results of his excavation in The Roman Fort Near Brecon. He then began excavations at Isca Augusta, a Roman site in Caerleon, where he focused on revealing the Roman amphitheatre. Intent on attracting press attention to both raise public awareness of archaeology and attract new sources of funding, he contacted the press and organised a sponsorship of the excavation by the middle-market newspaper the Daily Mail. In doing so, he emphasised the folkloric and legendary associations that the site had with King Arthur. In 1925, Oxford University Press published Wheeler's first book for a general audience, Prehistoric and Roman Wales; he later expressed the opinion that it was not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>book.</b>|$|E

500|$|IGN gave Ghosts of Onyx good marks, praising Nylund's writing {{style and}} how Onyx managed {{to tie up}} many plot threads that were left hanging from both the novels and the games. The {{publication}} did note, however, that the Master Chief made only a cameo appearance, and that Ghosts of Onyx is [...] "about the supporting cast of characters", rather than the heroes of the video game. Offering a less positive outlook on the book were publications like Subnova.com, which blasted the novel as being much worse than , introducing characters the reader didn't care about and using too much jargon. The reviewer stated that [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>book.</b> Honest. It just doesn't measure up to the standard set by the other books in the series."

[...] Patton was impressed with the Soviet Union but was disdainful of Russians as [...] "drunks" [...] with [...] "no regard for human life".

However, he doubted from an early stage that the book would sell well. He considered {{it would be a good}} read, but not for the [...] "take-a-book-to-bed public". As he progressed further, he began to see that the book would have very limited appeal, but equally he was convinced that it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>book</b> and the best work he had done. He was happy that it took his writing in a new direction and would confound the attempts of the critics to pigeonhole him, and, with a slightly masochistic joy he looked forward to their [...] "rage and contempt".

500|$|Waugh's {{friends were}} {{generally}} {{enthusiastic about the}} book. Anthony Powell {{thought that it was}} one of Waugh's most interesting works, and Graham Greene placed it among the writer's best fiction. The Donaldsons thought that he had [...] "succeeded wonderfully" [...] in providing so vivid an account of his experiences. John Betjeman, reviewing the book for The Daily Telegraph, wrote: [...] "The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold is self-examination written as a novel, but unlike other such works, which are generally dreary and self-pitying, this, because it is by Mr Waugh, is readable, thrilling and detached". Other reviewers were generally more circumspect. Philip Toynbee in The Observer found it [...] "very hard to say whether it is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>book</b> or not; it is certainly an interesting and a moving one". He sensed in Waugh's writing a [...] "change of gear", a point picked up by John Raymond in the New Statesman. Raymond thought Waugh was the only current English novelist whose work showed signs of development, and that in Pinfold had produced [...] "one of his wittiest, most humane entertainments", a work of self-revelation only marred, in Raymond's view, by an unsatisfactory conclusion. The Times Literary Supplements reviewer R.G.G. Price deemed it a [...] "thin little tale", while acknowledging that Waugh as a comic writer could reasonably be compared with P.G. Wodehouse in terms of originality and humour.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} season, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Tyrion {{is just about}} the only {{character}} developing any complexity. Maybe even a glimmer of a conscience." [...] Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker noted, [...] "If the show has a hero, it's Tyrion (Dinklage), who is capable of cruelty but also possesses insight and empathy, concealed beneath a carapace of Wildean wit." [...] The Hollywood Reporter called Tyrion [...] "the one to watch, as he's the smartest Lannister and knows that having a brat for a king – who mistreats all those around him – could cause major backlash." [...] Willa Paskin of Salon called the character's increased prominence in Season 2 [...] "a trade up in entertainment value, and a trade-off in morality." [...] She added, [...] "Tyrion is more cynical, more manipulative and much better suited to surviving. He's not so keen to be made into meat, and that makes him the kind of man characters in the show and audience members alike should be investing in." [...] Praising Dinklage, Dan Kois of The New York Times wrote, [...] "He plays Tyrion as the only modern man in a muddy, violent, primal world. He loves good food, good conversation and <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>book.</b> Unlike the warmongering lords and knights of Westeros, but like most HBO subscribers, he would prefer to stay out of battle." [...] Kois adds that, [...] "Dinklage's bravado masks Tyrion's deep well of melancholy." [...] Of the Season 2 storyline, Dinklage noted that Tyrion enjoys not only his foray into battle, but also his new and unprecedented power at court. He said, [...] "This is a character that's been shit upon his whole life. I mean, he comes from great wealth, but he's treated very poorly, so now there's a newfound respect where if somebody calls him a name, he can have them killed. He never had that before. Tyrion definitely enjoys that part and he's trying desperately to hold onto it. He's enjoying it while it lasts 'cause he's not sure it's gonna last very long." [...] As Varys the Spymaster tells Tyrion, power is [...] "a trick, a shadow on the wall ... and a very small man can cast a very large shadow." ...|$|E

But {{it is a very}} good bad book. It's stuffed with interesting nuggets. It's brightly written. And if you get away from the generational mumbo jumbo, it illuminates changes that really do seem to be taking place.” [...] Further, Mr. Brooks wrote that the generations aren't treated equally: [...] "Basically, it sounds as if America has two greatest generations {{at either end of the}} age scale and two crummiest in the middle".|$|E
2500|$|Weaning is {{the process}} of {{replacing}} breast milk with other foods; the infant is fully weaned after the replacement is complete. Psychological factors affect the weaning process for both mother and infant, as issues of closeness and separation are very prominent. [...] If the baby is less than a year old substitute bottles are necessary; an older baby may accept milk from a cup. [...] Unless a medical emergency necessitates abruptly stopping breastfeeding, it is best to gradually cut back on feedings to allow the breasts to adjust to the decreased demands without becoming engorged. [...] La Leche League advises: [...] "The nighttime feeding is usually the last to go. Make a bedtime routine not centered around breastfeeding. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>book</b> or two will eventually become more important than a long session at the breast." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to a {{compilation}} by Deb Aoki of About.com, Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths {{was considered the}} best new manga of 2011 because it was included in 18 critics lists of best comics/graphic novels.

Pastes Garrett Martin wrote that the [...] "realistic depictions of normal men trapped in a horrible situation" [...] makes Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths [...] "brutally honest". Brigid Alverson of MTV Geek said, [...] "this {{is not an easy}} story to read, but its historical importance and the lessons it holds for the future are undeniable". Noel Murray writing in The A.V.

The music and gameplay were also complimented, but the game's presentation was criticised– especially {{the presentation of the}} dialogue, which only takes up a few lines per page. Caty McCarthy of Kill Screen wrote that VA-11 HALL-A [...] "flips the atypical ways of cyberpunk", and lauded the game's story, which [...] "has heart" [...] as a [...] "story of its people, its liliths, its sentient preserved-brains, its talking dogs. It's the story of Jill and her customers, all being lost, and eventually finding their way." [...] She compared it also to <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>book,</b> where [...] "we, the player, take the backseat, and soak it all in." [...] A final score of 80/100 was awarded. Zack Kotzer, writing for Motherboard, compared VA-11 HALL-A to [...] "Ghost in the Shell meets Cheers", and added that what makes the game engaging is that it chooses to focus on [...] "one very specific corner" [...] of a complex world, writing [...] "sure, there's an urban war brewing outside, but inside this [...] is just people.
