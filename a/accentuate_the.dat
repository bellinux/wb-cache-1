5|$|As older {{generation}} of Waffen-SS scribes has died off, a new, post-war cadre of writers has {{done much to}} perpetuate {{the image of the}} force as a revolutionary European army. The degree of admiration and acceptance varies, but the overall tendency to <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> positive lives on, or has indeed grown stronger.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{achievements}} {{and support for}} Catholics were particularly praised by Bob Santamaria, the unofficial leader and guiding influence of the Democratic Labor Party (DLP). The DLP had broken away from the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the nation's main centre-left social democratic party. The split occurred in the 1950s during the McCarthyism scares, as the Catholic factions broke away to form the DLP {{on the basis that}} the ALP was too lenient towards communists. One of the reasons that Menzies strongly backed Diệm was to gain further favour with the DLP and <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> divisions among his left wing opponents.|$|E
5|$|Palladio deeply {{considered}} the dual purpose of his villas as both farmhouses and palatial weekend retreats for wealthy merchant owners. These symmetrical temple-like houses often have equally symmetrical, but low, wings sweeping {{away from them}} to accommodate horses, farm animals, and agricultural stores. The wings, sometimes detached and connected to the villa by colonnades, were designed not only to be functional but also to complement and <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> villa. They were, however, in no way intended {{to be part of}} the main house, and it is in the design and use of these wings that Palladio's followers in the 18th century adapted to become an integral part of the building.|$|E

5|$|The hoard {{contains}} about 100 silver and silver-gilt items; {{the number is}} imprecise because there are unmatched broken parts. They include a statuette of a leaping tigress, made as a handle for an object such as a jug or lamp; four pepper-pots (piperatoria); a beaker; a vase or juglet (a small jug); four bowls; a small dish; and 98 silver spoons and ladles. The beaker and juglet are decorated with similar leaf and stem patterns, and the juglet has three gilded bands. In contrast, the small bowls and dish are plain, and it is presumed that {{the owners of the}} Hoard had many more such items, probably including the large decorated dishes found in other hoards. Many pieces are gilded in parts to <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> decoration. The technique of fire-gilding with mercury was used, as was typical at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church consists of a large, open floor plan, with wooden pews lined perpendicular {{to the north and}} south sides, thus creating a central aisle. The altar is a small wooden pulpit, which serves as a lectern that is accessible by a small wooden step; the altar is accented by a large wooden backdrop of casing with dentil molding. Each of the church's interior walls is covered with pine wainscot panelling and wallpaper, and topped with wooden crown molding. Wooden swag moldings <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> four symmetrically-placed six-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, the doorway's wooden casing, and the transom window. The wooden pews are simple, with cushions added for comfortable seating. The original ceiling is obscured by a dropped ceiling, which also conceals the electrical conduits for the church's brass chandeliers. Prior to the church's electrification, kerosene lanterns were used for light, and the lanterns remain in the church for decorative purposes. The church's floor consists of the original heart pine planks. Concrete blocks and cut stone border the building's perimeter to prevent animals from entering the church's crawl space. Within the crawl space, log carrier beams support the building, on which the bark remains extant.|$|E
5|$|While no new locales were {{introduced}} in Episode One, large alterations {{were made to the}} appearance of both City 17 where the game takes place and the Citadel from the end of Half-Life 2 to reflect the changing shape of the world and remind the player that their actions have major effects on the story line. The Citadel has degenerated from the cold, alien, and imposing fortress of the previous game into an extremely unstable state. This provides a visual cue to the player of the catastrophic damage they inflicted, and it allows for the introduction of new gameplay elements that <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> dangers which come with the Citadel's imminent collapse. In addition, it serves a thematic purpose by highlighting the weakening of the Combine's dominance in City 17. Likewise, City 17 has been altered to reflect the aftermath of the resistance's open rebellion, with vast swathes of destroyed buildings, and the introduction of foes previously kept outside its confines in Half-Life 2 to emphasize the scale of the uprising.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} has {{a total of}} 927 windows and they are painted in the colours of the rainbow. Some may notice that the coloured windows on the first four stories have the same vibrant intensity, while the upper windows gradually intensify to <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> cantilevered balconies which are interesting architectural features of this historical building.|$|E
25|$|For {{the final}} battle of Kirk and Picard against Soran, McCarthy used staccato music to <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> fistfight. For Kirk's death, McCarthy mated lyrical strings with another {{statement}} of the Courage theme, while a shot of Picard standing over Kirk's grave is scored with more pomp. The Courage theme plays again at the film's close.|$|E
25|$|If {{the hands}} are raised over the head, palms together, (as per the variation) this {{stretches}} the thoracic cavity and rib structures including the intercostal muscles and expands the thoracic cavity increasing lung capacity.

25|$|Its eastern neighbor, 124 East 80th, the Clarence Dillon House, {{is also a}} six-story brick {{building}} in the Neo-Georgian style. Its front facade culminates in a pediment, which along with the high end chimneys conceals the two top stories. It, too, has a classically detailed entrance, flanked by Ionic pilasters supporting a segmented pediment. Brick quoins <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> second and third stories.|$|E
25|$|Each of {{the twenty}} eight windows is different, but {{together}} {{they form a}} mosaic of color and sunlit beauty that <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> dignity and serenity of Trinity Episcopal Church. Between 1991 and 1992, Advent Glass Works conducted an inspection and appraisal, then performed total restoration of twenty-nine windows in the church. Due to the immense value of the windows, new protective glazing was installed.|$|E
25|$|Selah {{is used in}} Iyaric Rastafarian vocabulary. It can {{be heard}} {{at the end of}} spoken-word {{segments}} of some reggae songs. Its usage here, again, is to <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> magnitude and importance of what has been said, and often is a sort of substitute for Amen. Notable, according to Rastafarian faith, is also the word's similarity with the incarnated god and savior Selassie (Ethiopia's former emperor Haile Selassie).|$|E

25|$|The {{illumination}} {{contrasts with}} the natural and directional lighting of the four upper interior wings, and {{of each of the}} outer wings. It has been interpreted as a device to emphasize the presence of the divine and <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> paradise of the central landscape. The dove as the Holy Spirit, and the lamb as Jesus, are positioned on the same axis as that of God The Father in the panel directly above; a reference to the Holy Trinity.|$|E
25|$|A mid-diastolic {{rumbling}} murmur with presystolic accentuation will {{be heard}} after the opening snap. The murmur is best heard at the apical region and is not radiated. Since it is a low-pitch sound, it is heard best with the bell of the stethoscope. Its duration increases with worsening disease. Rolling the patient toward left as well as isometric exercise will <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> murmur. A thrill might be present when palpating at the apical region of the precordium.|$|E
25|$|The {{horseshoe}} arch {{became a}} popular feature in Islamic structures. Some suggest the Muslims acquired {{this from the}} Visigoths in Spain but they may have obtained it from Syria and Persia where the horseshoe arch had been in use by the Byzantines. In Moorish architecture, the curvature of the horseshoe arch is much more accentuated. Furthermore, alternating colours were added to <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> effect of its shape. This {{can be seen at}} a large scale in their major work, the Great Mosque of Córdoba.|$|E

When only one surdo is playing, it <b>accentuates</b> <b>the</b> 2nd and 4th beat of every measure. When a second surdo is playing, it is tuned slightly higher and is played <b>accentuating</b> <b>the</b> first and third beats of the measure. A third surdo de terceira or Surdo-mor syncopates in between the beats.|$|R

25|$|Chlorpromazine {{may also}} {{interact}} with epinephrine (adrenaline) {{to produce a}} paradoxical fall in blood pressure. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and thiazide diuretics may also <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> orthostatic hypotension experienced by those receiving chlorpromazine treatment. Quinidine may interact with chlorpromazine to increase myocardialdepression. Likewise it may also antagonize the effects of clonidine and guanethidine. It also may reduce the seizure threshold and hence a corresponding titration of anticonvulsant treatments should be considered. Prochlorperazine and desferrioxamine may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce transient metabolic encephalopathy.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the bathroom, the walls in the house featured diverse surface treatment. Almost every wall is decorated with hand painted and stenciled art recreating geometric patterns and classic motifs: garlands, pilasters, columns and linear designs to <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> corners. All floors are of wooden planks made out of tabloncillo (sideroxylon portoricense), with {{the exception}} of the gallery's floor, which consist of hydraulic cement tiles, result of an early twentieth century intervention. The ceiling also consists of wooden planks, mostly decorated with hand painted geometric motifs and stenciled designs.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to offering its affiliated member-stores reduced wholesale prices generated from economies of scale, the Co-operative Central Exchange conducted educational activities aimed at making retail stores more successful. These included a training school for store managers, established in 1918, {{and the introduction}} of a simple and efficient system of bookkeeping for cooperative stores developed by H.V. Nurmi. The CCE also campaigned against the practice of stores selling on credit — a risky practice which tended to create cash flow problems and to <b>accentuate</b> <b>the</b> effect of periodic economic downturns.|$|E
