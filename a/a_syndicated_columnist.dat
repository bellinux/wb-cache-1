5|$|Elmer {{recounts the}} initial violent {{backlash}} by humanity and how Ben hid {{the three of}} them from groups out to kill chickens. This is followed by retaliation against humans by chickens, chicken-rights groups, and eventually recognition of chickens as humans by the United Nations. During this time, Elmer becomes <b>a</b> <b>syndicated</b> <b>columnist</b> in a newspaper and writes about chicken-related topics, both light-hearted and serious. The peace between humans and chickens is disrupted in the late 1980s by an outbreak of bird flu. Millions of healthy chickens are killed by humans {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease, and Ben hides Elmer and Helen again. When others come for them, Ben intervenes and is accidentally shot protecting Elmer. Once the flu is contained, humanity expresses regret for its rash actions and Elmer writes a scathing editorial about the panic. His journal entries become less frequent after he and Helen have children.|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} favorable. Columnist Joan Crosby noted that [...] "This {{is the kind}} of show you don't think you'll laugh at, but you do, mostly because the cast is so good." [...] She noted that Cleavon Little, Joan Van Ark, and Reva Rose were, respectively, [...] "marvelous", [...] "pretty", and [...] "funny", and that Nancy Fox [...] "wins this year's cute-as-a-kitten award". Barbara Holsopple, TV and radio editor for the Pittsburgh Press, noted that [...] "ABC did a gutsy turnabout in taking the heavy drama out of a {{hospital}} and replacing it with comedy.

Win Fanning, <b>a</b> <b>syndicated</b> <b>columnist,</b> stated that: [...] "the comedy writing and performances by a beautifully integrated cast give Temperatures a bright, light quality so seldom achieved in a situation comedy", and that it was: [...] "loaded with one-liners and sight gags, which, if kept on the level of the opener, promise many hours of hilarity". Fanning praised Little as [...] "one of the comedy finds of any TV season", and Fox as [...] "a fresh new face and talent giving promise of a long, successful career ahead". More praise for the series came after the broadcast of its fourth episode. An unidentified reviewer, writing for the Armored Sentinel (of Temple, Texas), stated [...] "If you're suffering from the case of the 'downs,' this series is a sure pick up!" [...] The reviewer went on to note that [...] "the brightest spot of the series is wacky Nancy Fox. Her role applies the wackiness of Goldie Hawn, but in situation comedy form. I'd watch the show just for her! The whole series is wacky and funny; it's downright good. I highly recommend it." ...|$|E
