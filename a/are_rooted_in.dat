5|$|Nolan's films <b>are</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> {{epistemological}} and metaphysical themes, exploring human morality, {{the construction}} of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. His body of work is permeated by materialistic perspectives, nonlinear storytelling, practical special effects, innovative soundscapes, large-format film photography, and analogous relationships between visual language and narrative elements. In addition to his filmmaking, he is a vocal advocate for film preservation and the continued availability of film stock.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft wields the English philosopher John Locke's {{definition}} of property (that is, ownership acquired through labour) against Burke's notion of inherited wealth. She contends that inheritance {{is one of}} the major impediments to the progress of European civilization, and repeatedly argues that Britain's problems <b>are</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> the inequity of property distribution. Although she did not advocate a totally equal distribution of wealth, she did desire one that was more equitable.|$|E
5|$|A dance crew {{is a team}} {{of street}} dancers who come {{together}} to develop new moves and battle other crews. As hip-hop culture spread throughout New York City, the more often breaking crews got together to battle against each other. It was during this time that the different dance moves within breaking developed organically. All styles of hip-hop <b>are</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> battling, and {{being a part of}} a crew {{was the only way to}} learn when these styles began because they were not taught in studios: they all started out as social dances. Forming and participating in a crew is how street dancers practiced, improved, made friends, and built relationships. In breaking in particular, battling is how b-boys/b-girls improved their skill.|$|E

5|$|Modern-day Olympic equestrian events <b>are</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> cavalry {{skills and}} {{classical}} horsemanship, and through 1948, competition {{was restricted to}} active-duty officers on military horses. Only after 1952, as mechanization of warfare {{reduced the number of}} military riders, were civilian riders allowed to compete. Equestrian is the only Olympic sport in which animals compete with humans, and is one of four sports in which the genders compete against each other, the others being some sailing divisions, mixed doubles division in tennis and the mixed doubles division of badminton. The rules for Olympic equestrian competition are set by the Fédération Équestre Internationale, the international governing body for equestrian sports.|$|E
5|$|Other thinkers have {{emphasised}} {{the pursuit}} of power as a virtue. Some philosophies <b>are</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> the love of power because philosophies tend to be coherent unification in {{the pursuit of}} some goal or desire. Just as a philosophy may strive for truth, it may also strive for happiness, virtue, salvation, or, finally, power. Among those philosophies which Russell condemns as rooted in love of power: all forms of idealism and anti-realism, such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte's solipsism; certain forms of Pragmatism; Henri Bergson's doctrine of Creative evolution; and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche (Russell 1938:209–214).|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{literature}} is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which <b>are</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively. There are four major themes {{that can be}} found within historical Canadian literature; nature, frontier life, Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the garrison mentality. By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best. Canada's ethnic and cultural diversity are reflected in its literature, with many of its most prominent modern writers focusing on ethnic life. Arguably, the best-known living Canadian writer internationally (especially since the deaths of Robertson Davies and Mordecai Richler) is Margaret Atwood, a prolific novelist, poet, and literary critic. Numerous other Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards; including Nobel Laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English; and Booker Prize recipient Michael Ondaatje, who is perhaps best known for the novel The English Patient, which was adapted as a film of the same name that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.|$|E

5|$|Like the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, Salamis {{has gained}} {{something}} of a 'legendary' status (unlike, for instance, the more decisive Battle of Plataea), {{perhaps because of the}} desperate circumstances and the unlikely odds. A significant number of historians have stated that Salamis {{is one of the most}} significant battles in human history (though the same is often stated of Marathon). In a more extreme form of this argument, some historians argue that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis, the ensuing conquest of Greece by the Persians would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as we know it. This view is based on the premise that much of modern Western society, such as philosophy, science, personal freedom and democracy <b>are</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> the legacy of Ancient Greece. Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the domination of much of modern history by Western Civilization, Persian domination of Greece might have changed the whole trajectory of human history. It is also worth mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential Athenian culture occurred only after the Persian wars were won.|$|E
5|$|Although {{subject to}} all {{national}} laws and government, the Antakarana are also {{united in their}} recognition of the authority of a king (Ampanjaka) who is the living descendent {{of a line of}} Antankarana royalty going back nearly four centuries. The authority of this king is reaffirmed every five years at the village of Ambatoharaña in a ritual mast-raising ceremony called the tsangantsainy. Although some accounts date the ritual back to the origins of Antankarana kingship, the specific features of the ceremony as practiced today <b>are</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> historical events of the 19th century. The ceremony includes a pilgrimage to Nosy Mitsio to commemorate the flight of Antankarana refugees to the island in the 1830s to escape the advancing armies of the Kingdom of Imerina and to visit the tombs of ancestors who died there; until recently, it has sometimes also included raising both French and Antankarana banners to honor the 1841 treaty signed with the French. The king is selected by a council of elder {{members of the royal family}} in the ruling line. He is responsible for reciting joro (ancestral invocations) at ceremonies where the ancestors' blessings are requested. Another important social role is that of the Ndriambavibe. The Antankarana community selects a single noble woman to hold this position, which has similar authority and importance to that of the king. She is not his wife; rather, she has a separate leadership role to fulfill. The Antankarana are recognized among Malagasy as one of the few remaining ethnic groups in Madagascar that continues to reassert the ancestral authority of their king through continued practice of traditional kingship rituals.|$|E
