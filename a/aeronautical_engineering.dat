5|$|From 1924 to 1928 he {{attempted}} without success to find employment {{as a civil}} engineer in California, where his father was now stationed. Instead he worked as an apprentice and journeyman boilermaker with the Steel Tank and Pipe Company in Berkeley, California. Advances in aviation in the 1920s led Hansell to undertake a career in <b>aeronautical</b> <b>engineering,</b> and to gain flying experience, he decided to join the United States Army Air Corps.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Kraft {{began his}} studies at Virginia Tech {{and became a}} member of the Corps of Cadets.

5|$|After {{his service}} with the Navy, Armstrong {{returned}} to Purdue, where his best grades {{came in the}} four semesters following his return from Korea. He had previously earned average marks, but his final GPA was 4.8 out of 6.0. He pledged the Phi Delta Theta fraternity after his return and he wrote and co-directed its musical {{as part of the}} all-student revue; he was also a member of Kappa Kappa Psi National Honorary Band Fraternity and a baritone player in the Purdue All-American Marching Band. Armstrong graduated in 1955 with a Bachelor of Science degree in <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Engineering.</b>|$|E
5|$|The EES's {{early work}} was {{conducted}} {{in the basement of}} the Shop Building, and Vaughan's office was in the <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Engineering</b> Building. By 1938, the EES was producing useful technology, and the station needed a method to conduct contract work outside of the state budget. Consequently, the Industrial Development Council (IDC) was formed. It was created by the Chancellor of the University System and the president of Georgia Power Company, and the EES's director was a member of the council. The IDC later became the Georgia Tech Research Corporation, which currently serves as the sole contract organization for all Georgia Tech faculty and departments.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aeronautical</b> <b>engineering</b> {{firms were}} quick {{to respond to the}} Comet's {{commercial}} advantages and technical flaws alike; other aircraft manufacturers learned from, and profited by, the hard-earned lessons embodied by de Havilland's Comet. While the Comet's buried engines were used on some other early jet airliners, such as the Tupolev Tu-104, later aircraft, such as the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, would differ by employing podded engines held on pylons beneath the wings. Boeing stated that podded engines were selected for their passenger airliners because buried engines carried a higher risk of catastrophic wing failure in the event of engine fire. In response to the Comet tragedies, manufacturers also developed various means of pressurisation testing, often {{going so far as to}} explore rapid depressurisation; subsequent fuselage skins were of a greater thickness than the skin of the Comet.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, Duxford {{announced}} plans for the redevelopment of Hangar 1, previously known as the 'Superhangar', which {{was built in the}} 1980s. The plans would expand the building by 40%, providing more display and conservation space, improve internal conditions, and enable the museum's British and Commonwealth aircraft collection to be brought under cover. Planning permission was received later that year. The project cost £25 million and was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund, the East of England Development Agency and BAE Systems, which contributed £6 million. The building, which provides 12,000m2 of floor space, consists of an aircraft conservation area, a large exhibition hall, and a mezzanine providing views of the aircraft and interactive educational installations exploring <b>aeronautical</b> <b>engineering</b> and the principles of flight.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Los Angeles City College from 1939 onward. Although Roddenberry {{ranked in}} the ninetieth percentile on an intelligence test, and in the 99th percentile on a reading test administered {{as part of his}} college entrance examination, he elected to major in the police science curriculum; as president of the school's Police Club, he communicated with police liaison Stanley Sheldon. During his second year, he developed an interest in <b>aeronautical</b> <b>engineering</b> and obtained a pilot's license through the United States Army Air Corps-sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program. He graduated from Los Angeles City College with an Associate of Arts degree in police science on June 26, 1941, becoming the first member of his family to earn a college degree. After graduating, he traveled to March Air Base and signed up for the Army Air Corps; {{due to the lack of}} training spaces his entrance was delayed. For the remainder of the summer, he attended Peace Officer training at the University of California, Los Angeles as an Army cadet.|$|E
5|$|In August 1940, a British mission, led by Tizard {{and with}} members that {{included}} Cockcroft, {{was sent to}} America to create relations and help advance the research towards war technology with the Americans. Several military technologies were shared, including advances in radar, antisubmarine warfare, <b>aeronautical</b> <b>engineering</b> and explosives. The American radar programme in particular was reinvigorated with an added impetus {{to the development of}} microwave radar and proximity fuses. This prompted the Americans to create the MIT Radiation Laboratory, which would later serve a model for the Los Alamos Laboratory. The mission did not spend much time on nuclear fission, with only two meetings of the subject, mainly about uranium enrichment. In particular, Cockcroft did not report Peierls' and Frisch's findings. Nonetheless, there were important repercussions. A barrier had been broken and a pathway to exchange technical information between the two countries was developed. Moreover, the notion of civilian scientists playing an important role of the development of military technologies was strengthened {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic.|$|E
