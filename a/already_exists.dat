5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy {{before it can}} flower. This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or {{very close to the}} soil surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation <b>already</b> <b>exists,</b> growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.|$|E
5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon <b>already</b> <b>exists</b> to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E

25|$|The {{specific}} name streptostelopsis {{is of the}} resemblance of Streptostele. It is Latinized Greek for Streptostele-like and refers to the likeness to shells of the streptaxid genus Streptostele. The kindred epithet streptosteloides <b>already</b> <b>exists</b> in the family Streptaxidae. The original combination was Opeas streptosteloides Von Martens, 1897, but this taxon {{appears to be a}} streptaxid, now named Streptostele streptosteloides (Von Martens, 1897). In view of the similarity of the names and probable causes for confusion in possibly closely allied genera the epithet streptostelopsis was proposed.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate about}} the nature of the mind is {{relevant}} to the development of artificial intelligence.

If, on the other hand, the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain, then it will be possible to create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers much different from today's), by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine <b>already</b> <b>exists</b> in the form of the human brain.|$|E

25|$|In the {{political}} philosophy of healthcare, {{the debate between}} universal healthcare and private healthcare is particularly contentious in the United States. In the 1960s, there was a plethora of public initiatives {{by the federal government}} to consolidate and modernize the U.S. healthcare system. With Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, the U.S. established public health insurance for both senior citizens and the underprivileged. Known as Medicare and Medicaid, these two healthcare programs granted certain groups of Americans access to adequate healthcare services. Although these healthcare programs were a giant step in the direction of socialized medicine, many people think that the U.S. needs to do more for its citizenry with respect to healthcare coverage. Opponents of universal healthcare see it as an erosion of the high quality of care that <b>already</b> <b>exists</b> in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Under CRTC rules, cable {{companies}} cannot offer a new American service if a comparable Canadian service <b>already</b> <b>exists.</b> However, if a Canadian equivalent begins operations after an American service {{has already been}} added to cable packages, the cable company {{is not required to}} discontinue the American service. (For example, Canadian {{cable companies}} cannot offer MTV, as the station was not yet available in Canada when MuchMusic began broadcasting in 1984. However, cable companies can offer CNN, as they were already offering that service when CBC Newsworld first aired in 1989.) The rules formerly required that the American service be removed if a Canadian equivalent is launched; this caused controversy when the US version of CMT was removed from the lineup when a new Canadian country music channel called the New Country Network launched. CMT had contested that this was a violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Ultimately, Viacom purchased a minority share in the network, and rebranded it under the CMT name.|$|E
25|$|Other {{residents}} use bicycle {{infrastructure in}} the area such as the neighborhood's class three Arterial Bike Route: 14th Street, 'BikeLink' bicycle lockers at the nearby 12th Street /City Center, 19th Street, and Lake Merritt BART Stations, and numerous city-installed bike racks to which they can lock their bikes. A Bicycle Rental business rents bikes by the hour nearby on the East side of Downtown. Oakland's Bicycle Master Plan, and Oakland's Measure DD park improvement plan for Lake Merritt calls for an automobile lane reduction and re-striping of bike lanes onto two of the district's streets: Lakeside Drive and Madison Street, and on nearby Webster and Franklin Streets, North of 14th Street. The plan also calls for the installation of a separated class one bikeway and multi-use trail immediately {{around the perimeter of}} Lake Merritt, and class two bicycle lanes on all arterial streets surrounding the lake, such as Grand Avenue, between Harrison and Macarthur, where a bike lane <b>already</b> <b>exists,</b> and on Lakeshore Boulevard, onto which a bicycle lane has been planned and contracted to be striped.|$|E

25|$|The {{transition}} from solitary living to group living (identified by John Maynard Smith {{as one of}} the seven major transitions in evolutionary history) brought with it many fitness benefits (increased anti-predator vigilance, foraging benefits etc.) and the opportunity to exploit a vast array of new ecological niches, but group living also has its pitfalls. Numerous studies have demonstrated an increase in contact-transmitted parasite load with group size increase, and thus research has been done on the role of social immunity in the evolution of early group living. Empirical evidence <b>already</b> <b>exists,</b> from both interspecific and intraspecific comparative studies, that an increase in population density drives an increase in personal immune effort (density-dependent prophylaxis). However, there is also good evidence that the evolution of social immunity leads to a trade-off between effort into personal immune responses vs. effort in social immune responses - physiological and genomic studies have shown that social conditions can lead to a reduction in personal immune effort. Personal immunity in the Australian plague locust (Chortoicetes terminifera) decreases upon an increase in population density and increases when artificially isolated. Genomic studies reveal that infected solitary S. gregaria express more genes involved in immunity than infected individuals in the gregarious phase, Bombus terrestris workers also upregualte immune-related genes when experimentally isolated and there are three times more immune-related gene families in solitary insects than in the eusocial honeybees.|$|E

500|$|Hans Singer {{suggested}} that Nurkse's theory makes dubious {{assumptions about the}} underdeveloped economy. For example, Nurkse assumes that the economy starts with nothing at hand.

Clearly, such an investment cannot be a balanced one. If an economy makes the mistake of setting {{out to make a}} balanced investment, a new imbalance is likely to appear which will require still another [...] "balancing investment" [...] to bring equilibrium, {{and so on and so}} forth.|$|E
