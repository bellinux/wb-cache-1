5|$|Like {{many other}} light {{anti-tank}} guns, the M3 was {{widely used in}} the infantry support role and as an <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapon,</b> firing high-explosive and canister rounds.|$|E
5|$|Another small-bore cannon of the 14th {{century was}} the culverin, whose name derives from the snake-like handles {{attached}} to it. It was transitional between the handgun and the full cannon, and {{was used as an}} <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapon.</b> The culverin was forged of iron and fixed to a wooden stock, and usually placed on a rest for firing.|$|E
5|$|The cannon {{appeared}} in 12th century China, probably as a parallel development or {{evolution of the}} fire-lance, a short ranged <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapon</b> combining a gunpowder-filled tube and a polearm of some kind. Co-viative projectiles such as iron scraps or porcelain shards were placed in fire lance barrels at some point, and eventually, the paper and bamboo materials of fire lance barrels were replaced replaced by metal.|$|E

50|$|Bombshell is {{a master}} juggler and an {{explosives}} expert. Bombshell uses an array of <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapons</b> including hand grenades, stun grenades and smoke bombs. She also has concealed weaponry in her wrist bands that fire stun blasts.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} medieval cannon, the pot-de-fer, had bulbous, vase-like shape, and {{was used}} more for psychological effect than for causing physical damage. The later culverin was transitional between the handgun and the full cannon, {{and was used}} as an <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapon.</b> During the 15th century, cannon advanced significantly, so that bombards were effective siege engines. Towards the end of the period, the cannon gradually replaced siege enginesamong other forms of aging weaponryon the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Various {{types of}} {{ammunition}} {{could be used}} for different purposes: plain spherical shot of stone or iron smashed hulls, spiked bar shot and shot linked with chains would tear sails or damage rigging, and canister shot packed with sharp flints produced a devastating shotgun effect. Trials made with replicas of culverins and port pieces showed that they could penetrate wood the same thickness of the Mary Rose's hull planking, indicating a stand-off range of at least 90m (295ft). The port pieces proved particularly efficient at smashing large holes in wood when firing stone shot and were a devastating <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapon</b> when loaded with flakes or pebbles.|$|E
25|$|Breech-loading swivel {{guns were}} also used {{extensively}} in Southeast Asia {{as early as the}} 16th century, apparently even before the arrival of the Portuguese and Spanish there, and continued to be in use as a preferred <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapon</b> as late as the 20th century. The Americans fought Moros equipped with breech-loading swivel guns in the Philippines in 1904.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, {{a report}} on the BBC Today {{programme}} claimed that a salesman from PW Defence, a Chemring subsidiary, had agreed to sell landmines to an undercover reporter. The <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapons</b> were outlawed in the UK in 1998, following the signing of the Ottawa Treaty.|$|R
50|$|In 1603-04 she was rebuilt {{a second}} time as a great ship (or second rank), and renamed Assurance. Now of 451 tons, she carried 34 primary guns (2 cannon periers, 10 culverins, 12 demi-culverins and 10 sakers) and 4 smaller and more <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapons</b> (fowlers).|$|R
50|$|In 1603-05 she was rebuilt {{a second}} time as a great ship, and renamed Nonsuch. Now of 454 tons, she carried 32 primary guns (2 cannon periers, 12 culverins, 12 demi-culverins and 6 sakers) and 6 smaller and more <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapons</b> (2 falconets and 4 fowlers).|$|R
25|$|Howitzers {{were best}} suited for {{long-range}} fire. When howitzers and cannons were mixed in artillery batteries, the howitzers tended to be used at the shorter ranges where cannons were more effective. This led to a higher expenditure of ammunition. While artillery could be very destructive, it also exercised a psychological effect. Soldiers were frightened of long range artillery fire to which their short-ranged muskets could not respond. If possible, the British deployed their soldiers behind crests to minimize losses from artillery fire, but all other nations usually deployed their troops in the open. At close ranges, the gunners fired canister shot, an <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapon.</b> A canister round spewed a load of musket balls toward the target, when fired. Normally, howitzers fired shells at their targets. Unlike cannons which fired on a more flat trajectory, howitzers were designed to throw a shell on an arching trajectory.|$|E
25|$|The {{cannonball}} or {{round shot}} was the projectile most often used. Both direct and ricochet fire {{could be used}} to hit a target. Round shot was most effective when used against formed troops in column and was somewhat less effective against troops in line. Soldiers were frightened of long range artillery fire because their short-ranged muskets could not retaliate against the gunners. The British deployed their soldiers on reverse slopes when possible to avoid losses from artillery fire, but all other nations generally arrayed their soldiers in the open. However, when under a severe bombardment by 50 Austrian guns at the Battle of Aspern-Essling, the French Imperial Guard redeployed from a 3-deep line to a 1-deep line to minimize losses and keep the appearance of a solid front. At closer ranges, the gunners switched to canister, an <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapon.</b> When canister was fired, its load of musket balls flew toward the target while spreading out.|$|E
25|$|The {{cannonball}} or {{round shot}} {{was the most}} frequently used projectile. Both direct and ricochet fire might be used to hit a target. Round shot was most effective when used against troops formed in column {{and to a lesser extent}} against those deployed in line. Most soldiers despised long-range artillery fire because they could not shoot back with shorter-ranged muskets. The British protected their troops from round shot by placing them behind ridgelines when possible, but all other nations normally posted their soldiers in the open. At close range, artillerists switched to canister, an <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapon.</b> A canister round contained a large number of musket balls that, when fired, spread out and flew in the direction of the target. When supporting an attack, the cannons advanced with the infantry. Half the guns moved forward, covered by the second half, then the second half moved up, covered by the first half. When under attack by enemy infantry, the cannons first fired at the enemy artillery. As the range closed, the guns aimed at the enemy foot soldiers.|$|E
5000|$|The rated {{number of}} guns often {{differed}} from the number a vessel actually carried. The guns that determined a ship's rating were the carriage-mounted cannon, long-barreled, muzzle-loading guns that moved on 'trucks'—wooden wheels. The count did not include smaller (and basically <b>anti-personnel)</b> <b>weapons</b> such as swivel-mounted guns ("swivels"), which fired half-pound projectiles, or small arms.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} common thermal projectiles were {{boiling water and}} hot sand, which could be poured over attacking personnel. Other <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapons</b> included the use of hot pitch, oil, resin, animal fat and other similar compounds. Smoke was used to confuse or drive off attackers. Substances such as quicklime and sulfur could be toxic and blinding.|$|R
50|$|The ARV-A-L MULE Vehicle (ARV-A-L) (XM1219) {{would have}} {{featured}} an integrated weapons and reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) package {{to support the}} dismounted infantry’s efforts to locate and destroy enemy platforms and positions. The ARV-A-L would have supported both anti-tank and <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapons</b> platforms that will be remotely operated by network linked Soldiers. This variant was cancelled in July 2011.|$|R
25|$|The {{cannonball}} or {{round shot}} was the projectile used most often. Both direct and ricochet fire {{might be used}} to strike a target. Round shot was most effective when used against formed troops, particularly those in column and to a lesser degree against those in line. Most soldiers hated to be under long-range artillery fire because they were unable to shoot back at their tormentors with shorter-ranged muskets. The British avoided exposing their troops to round shot by placing them behind crests when possible, but all other nations customarily deployed their soldiers in the open. At closer ranges, the gunners switched to canister, an <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapon.</b> A canister round consisted {{of a large number of}} musket balls that, when fired, spread out and flew in the direction of the target. When supporting an attack, the cannons advanced with the infantry. Half the guns moved forward, covered by the remaining guns, then the other half moved, repeating the process. The battalion pieces, usually 4-pounders, fired at the enemy foot soldiers while the heavier guns targeted the enemy artillery. When under attack by enemy infantry, the cannons first fired at the enemy artillery. As the range closed, the guns aimed at the enemy foot soldiers.|$|E

50|$|By the 15th century most Mediterranean {{powers were}} utilising heavy cannon {{mounted on the}} bow or stern of a vessel and {{designed}} to bombard fortresses on shore. By mid-century some vessels also carried smaller broadside cannons for bombarding other vessels immediately prior to an attempted boarding. These small guns were <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapons</b> and were fired at point blank range to accompany engagement with muskets or bows.|$|R

50|$|Many of {{the units}} {{available}} in Dawn of War were simplified, reduced or limited for the Winter Assault expansion. For example, Space Marine Predator tanks were limited to carrying anti-tank weapons while Chaos Predators were limited to <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapons.</b> In the original Dawn of War game both sides could upgrade their tanks from anti-personnel to anti-tank (Destructor pattern and Annihilator pattern respectively). Likewise the Land Raider was limited to one per player but in turn had greatly increased durability.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} more exotic classes of weapons, such as neutron bombs, chemicals, and {{biological}} weapons, which are only designed to attack people. As there is greater international criticism of them, they are therefore rarely used. These are not generally referred to as <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>weapons,</b> but by their own names or group terms (e.g., NBC weapons) by which they are specifically banned. Such weapons often create much collateral damage and may affect large numbers of civilians.|$|R
