5|$|The High Middle Ages was {{a period}} of {{tremendous}} expansion of population. The estimated population of Europe grew from 35 to 80 million between 1000 and 1347, although the exact causes remain unclear: improved agricultural techniques, the decline of slaveholding, a more clement climate and the lack of invasion have all been suggested. As much as 90per cent of the European population remained rural peasants. Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities, usually known as manors or villages. These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services, in a system known as manorialism. There remained a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond, with more of them in the regions of Southern Europe than in the north. The practice of <b>assarting,</b> or bringing new lands into production by offering incentives to the peasants who settled them, also contributed to the expansion of population.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} woodland was mixed, predominantly oak, {{but also}} including elm, lime, yew, chestnut, fir, larch, beech, ash, silver birch, hazel, willow and alder. The forest area also encompassed heath and wetland, {{as well as}} pasture, arable land and even small settlements. Agriculture was, however, allowed within the forest boundaries only under severe restrictions; <b>assarting,</b> or enclosing and clearing new land for agriculture, was completely prohibited until 1215–16.|$|E
2500|$|Since the Enclosure Acts of {{the eighteenth}} century, the UK's uplands (including Wales and the Scottish Highlands) have largely been {{associated}} with animal husbandry and forestry. [...] However, {{by the time of}} the Enclosure Acts, most of lowland Britain was already enclosed by processes such as <b>assarting</b> or illegal, but tolerated, piecemeal enclosure. [...] However, evidence of the former open field system of agriculture can still be seen in some parts of the landscape, such as in the indentations remaining from boundary ditches of the former farming strips. Enclosure, in turn, led to intensification.|$|E
50|$|The term ‘assart’ {{was also}} used for a parcel of land <b>assarted.</b> <b>Assart</b> rents were those paid to the British Crown for the forest lands <b>assarted.</b> The word origin is from the French word essarter meaning to remove or grub out woodland. In {{northern}} England this {{is referred to as}} ‘ridding’.|$|R
50|$|In practice, this {{expansion}} into new lands {{manifested itself in}} the form of <b>assarts.</b> <b>Assarts</b> were lands that were newly cultivated from land formerly considered ‘waste.’ There were several different versions of the expansion. The reclamation of valleys prone to flooding and planting at higher altitudes due to the warmer and drier climate have already been mentioned.|$|R
50|$|The Lord Treasurer Robert Cecil {{began the}} work of disafforestation across the Royal estate. In Feckenham, the Crown raised £1100 {{from the sale of}} 1600 trees in 1609; and in 1612 £821 from the sale of <b>assart</b> lands. In the {{following}} years, more wood was cut down. King James's Lord Treasurer Cranfield commissioned surveys into <b>assart</b> lands of various forests, including Feckenham in 1622, in order to increase revenues from the forests. This accelerated the wider policy of disafforestation.|$|R
2500|$|The northerly Forest of Mara {{remained}} wooded in the 14th century, {{and still}} retained {{a population of}} wild boar and wolves. By that date, however, {{large areas of the}} southerly Forest of Mondrem had been cleared. The remaining Mondrem woodland in the mid-14th century appears to have been concentrated in the north around Castle Northwich, Hartford and Winnington, {{and to a lesser extent}} in the south east around Aston juxta Mondrum, Calveley, Cholmondeston, Church Minshull, Poole and Wettenhall. Extensive <b>assarting</b> by Vale Royal Abbey made a major contribution to the loss of Mondrem woodland before the abbey's dissolution. The proximity to the medieval salt [...] of Nantwich and Middlewich, with their wood-fuelled salt pans, might also have been a factor.|$|E
2500|$|This charter also, for {{the first}} time, conceded to the barons and their knights and freeholders the [...] "right to assart their lands within the arable area of the forest and to grow crops on land {{formerly}} cultivated and free from wood without payment." [...] Within the Forests of Mara and Mondrem, custom did not, however, follow the charter, a fine of 5 shillings per acre in Mondrem or 6 shillings 8 pence per acre in Mara being paid {{at the time of}} enclosure. Later, a licence was also required to assart forest land, which required the payment of a further fee and was very unpopular. Enclosure and <b>assarting</b> in Mara and Mondrem during this period is poorly documented, but is known to have occurred at Frodsham, Weaverham and Darnhall.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distribution}} maps available above {{show that}} the abbey's assets were heavily concentrated, tending to form natural groups, in Shropshire. This was a major advantage that Haughmond had over nearby Lilleshall, which always suffered from the running costs associated with a widely dispersed property portfolio. The acquisition policy of the abbey tended to strengthen this advantage, deliberately buying or requesting grants of adjoining estates to increase local concentrations of land. Beyond Leebotswood, for example, the abbey built up a large composite of holdings. A grant by Henry II of meadow on the Long Mynd {{marked the beginning of}} the venture. More benefactors contributed, especially the powerful Robert Corbet of Caus Castle, and a substantial monastic estate took shape, known as [...] the “domain of Boveria”, from the Latin bos/bovis, an ox, and meaning roughly [...] "cattle shed". [...] This land along the Wales–England border, was mostly waste when the canons arrived but quickly became excellent pasture, as the new name suggests. It fell in the Diocese of Hereford and it was Bishop Robert Foliot who gave the canons permission to turn their oratory at Stitt, in Ratlinghope manor, into church for the region. After it acquired Aston Abbots, in the early 13th century, the community built up another large group of holdings east of Oswestry at Hisland, Twyford and West Felton, and Great Ness. Wherever estates adjoined uncultivated areas, the community took to vigorous <b>assarting.</b> This had been specifically allowed by Henry II in some of his grants. To make administration easier, the estates were divided into 12 local bailiwicks. These were generally under lay management, but obedientiaries, canons with specific responsibilities for rent and tithe collection, were deputed by the abbots to keep in touch.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a network {{architecture}} with RFIDs and sensor nodes (ARIES), a mutual authentication protocol (AMULET), and a secret search protocol (<b>ASSART).</b> In ARIES, the distance limitation can be relieved {{with the help}} of widely deployed RFID-aware sensor nodes. AMULET can perform mutual authentication and reduce the cost for re-authentication. <b>ASSART</b> solves the privacy problem by offering a secret search mechanism over encrypted data. In this way, data will not be disclosed during communication and query processes...|$|R

5000|$|... 40 {{acres at}} Lindhurst in the king's own manor of Alrewas: an area <b>assarted</b> from the waste in Cannock Chase and lying {{along the edge}} of the bishop's land. This came with manorial rights, {{including}} pannage, pasturage, and access to waterways.|$|R
50|$|<b>Assarting</b> was {{described}} by landscape historian Richard Muir as usually being “like bites from an apple” as it was usually done {{on a small scale}} but large areas were sometimes cleared. Occasionally, people specialized in <b>assarting</b> and acquired the surname or family name of ‘Sart’.|$|E
50|$|<b>Assarting</b> {{has existed}} since Mesolithic times and often it {{relieved}} population pressures. During the 13th century, <b>assarting</b> was very active, but decreased with {{environmental and economic}} challenges in the 14th century. The Black Death in the late 1340s depopulated the countryside and many formerly assarted areas returned to woodland.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Assarting</b> is {{the act of}} {{clearing}} forested lands for use in agriculture or other purposes. In English land law, it was illegal to assart any part of a Royal forest without permission. This was the greatest trespass that could be committed in a forest, being more than a waste: for whereas waste of the forest involves felling trees and shrubs, this vegetation can grow again; <b>assarting</b> involves completely rooting up all trees [...] - [...] the total extirpation of the forested area.|$|E

50|$|Barker {{writes that}} there is an unusually long hedge in Shelley made up of coppiced lime trees. He writes that this follows the {{boundaries}} of remnants of nineteenth-century clearances of some of the ancient forest. Hedges of this sort are known as <b>assart</b> hedges.|$|R
50|$|Historically Fulwell {{formed the}} {{southern}} extent of Hounslow Heath {{and the underlying}} Taplow gravel that defined it. A reference to <b>assarts</b> at Fulwell dating from around 1200 are amongst the earliest records of the name. The area was progressively enclosed for agriculture and increasingly urbanised since the Victorian period of metropolitan expansion of outer London.|$|R
50|$|Field {{names in}} Britain {{sometimes}} retain their origin in <b>assarting</b> or colonisation by their names such as: ‘Stocks’; ‘Stubbings’; ‘Stubs’; ‘Assart’; ‘Sart’; ‘Ridding’; ‘Royd’; ‘Brake’; ‘Breach’; or ‘Hay’. Many Northern French places called ‘Les Essarts’ or ending with ‘-sart’ {{refer to that}} practice.|$|E
50|$|The {{southwest}} of the parish was farmed on an open field system. Villagers seem to have enlarged the open fields by <b>assarting</b> in the 13th and 14th centuries, and by the early 17th century their combined area was 470 acre. Parliament passed an inclosure act for Hailey in 1821, which was implemented in 1822-24.|$|E
50|$|The forests {{also had}} surveyors, who {{determined}} {{the boundaries of}} the forest, and regarders. These last reported to the court of justice-seat and investigated encroachments on the forest and invasion of royal rights, such as <b>assarting.</b> While their visits were infrequent, due to the interval of time between courts, they provided a check against collusion between the foresters and local offenders.|$|E
50|$|Jeff Hilson (born 1966) is a {{contemporary}} British poet. His works include A Grasses Primer (Form Books,2000), Stretchers (Reality Street, 2006), Bird Bird (Landfill 2009), and In The <b>Assarts</b> (Veer Books, 2010). He also edited The Reality Street Book of Sonnets, published in 2008. With Sean Bonney and David Miller he co-founded Crossing the Line, a reading series based in London.|$|R
50|$|The parish is {{elongated}} north-eastwards. A {{record of}} 1300 {{states that the}} manor of Asthall was extended into Wychwood Forest after 1154. The name of Field <b>Assarts</b> in the north-east of the parish refers to assarting: the mediaeval process of clearing any uncultivated land to convert it to agriculture. The north-eastern parts of Asthall parish remained purlieus of the Wychwood until it was disafforested in 1857.|$|R
5000|$|Indeed, a {{great deal}} of the land in the forest had long been cultivated. The covert of the forest {{consisted}} of the walks of Walkwood and Berrow Wood (at Berrow Hill in Feckenham), but there were few deer, because of the great flock of sheep that grazed in the forest. [...] No less than 732 acres had been <b>assarted</b> out of these by 1591.|$|R
50|$|Slash-and-burn agriculture, or fire-fallow cultivation, is a {{farming method}} that {{involves}} the cutting and burning of plants in a forest or woodland to create a field called a swidden. (Preparing fields by deforestation is called <b>assarting.)</b> In subsistence agriculture, slash-and-burn typically uses little technology. It is often applied in shifting cultivation agriculture (such as in the Amazon rainforest) and in transhumance livestock herding.|$|E
5000|$|The ancient Wychwood royal forest {{included}} {{the whole of}} Hailey, and {{the northern part of}} the parish was mostly woodland, wood-pasture and heath. But from the 13th century onwards <b>assarting</b> reduced the woodland in the north and east of the parish. The endings of local toponyms including Delly, Hailey and Poffley all come from leah, Middle English for a [...] "clearing".|$|E
5000|$|New {{creation}} of farmland (or 'agricultural land conversion') {{will rely on}} the conversion and development of previous forests, savannas or grassland. Re{{creation of}} farmland from wasteland, deserts or previous impervious surfaces is considerably less frequent because of the degraded or missing fertile soil in the latter. Starting from forests, land is made arable by <b>assarting</b> or slash-and-burn. Agricultural development furthermore includes: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{areas of}} {{broad-leaved}} woodland which dominate the Savernake Plateau {{are accompanied by}} a farmland mosaic. The plateau is within the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Beauty. The mosaic is emphasised by the <b>assarted</b> character of the area east of the Savernake (Coppices of Little Frith, Cobham Frith, Chisbury Wood, Haw Wood, etc.), where farmland occurs as clearings in a wider forest, creating a distinctive and memorable, 'secret' landscape.|$|R
50|$|Nuthall {{is split}} into two areas, Old Nuthall, which lies between the Nuthall Island {{roundabout}} and Kimberley, and New Nuthall, which lies between Bells Lane and Nuthall Island. New Nuthall also includes the Mornington Crescent Estate, a late 1980s/early 1990s exclusive development which borders Strelley and the Hempshill Vale estate and occupies the former site of <b>Assarts</b> Farm. New Nuthall also borders Broxtowe Country Park and a bypass road (Woodhouse Way).|$|R
50|$|When the Domesday Book was compiled, Islip's common fields {{system was}} {{on the north side}} of the River Ray. At some time before 1300, Islip's villagers <b>assarted</b> (cleared) about 200 acre of uncultivated land south of the River Ray and east of the River Cherwell and divided it into strips as a new common field for strip farming. In the 1970s this area of {{farmland}} was called Sart Field.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{forest was}} a predominantly oak-mixed woodland, but other species included elm, lime, yew, chestnut, fir, larch, beech, ash, silver birch, hazel, willow and alder. The forest area also encompassed heath and wetland, {{as well as}} pasture, arable land and even small settlements. Agriculture was, however, allowed within the forest boundaries only under severe restrictions; <b>assarting,</b> or enclosing and clearing new land for agriculture, was prohibited until 1215.|$|E
50|$|Trespasses {{against the}} vert were rather extensive: they {{included}} purpresture, the inclosure of a pasture or erection {{of a building}} on forest lands, <b>assarting,</b> clearing forest land for agriculture, and felling trees or clearing shrubs, among others. These laws applied to any land within the boundary of the forest, {{even if it were}} freely owned; although the Charter of the Forest in 1217 established that all freemen owning land within the forest enjoyed the rights of agistment and pannage (see below).|$|E
50|$|Since the Enclosure Acts of {{the eighteenth}} century, the UK's uplands (including Wales and the Scottish Highlands) have largely been {{associated}} with animal husbandry and forestry.

50|$|Clause 5 limits {{penalties}} {{that the}} earl's court could apply, but Graeme White argues that this {{applied only to}} the specific of non-attendance by judges and suitors; a far more restricted context than that specified in Magna Carta clauses 20 and 21. Clause Six grants various rights within the Cheshire forests: to <b>assart,</b> cultivate land and sell dead wood. Clause 8 protects widows and heirs, but makes no specific mention of wardship.|$|R
50|$|Cranfield {{commissioned}} surveys into <b>assart</b> {{lands of}} various forests, including Feckenham, Sedgemoor and Selwood, {{laying the foundations}} of the wide scale abolition of forests under Charles I. The commissioners appointed raised over £25000 by compounding with occupiers, whose ownership was confirmed, subject to a fixed rent. Cranfield's work led directly to the disafforestation of Gillingham Forest in Dorset and Chippenham and Blackmore in Wiltshire. Additionally, he created the model for abolition of the forests followed throughout the 1630s.|$|R
50|$|The eponymous forge {{replaced}} a decayed mill on the Smestow Brook. Greensforge formed {{part of a}} {{strip of}} meadows along the Smestow Brook, which were <b>assart</b> lands of Kinver Forest, i.e. lands cleared by medieval settlers. It was let to servants of Lord Dudley {{and may have been}} used by Dud Dudley. The forge was converted to a blade mill for sharpening scythes and other edged tools in the 1680s. This was rebuilt as a corn mill in the 19th century. This has recently (in 2008) been converted into flats.|$|R
