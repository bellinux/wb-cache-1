40|$|Abstract: We {{remark that}} the <b>A</b> <b>Contrario</b> <b>Argument</b> is an {{ambiguous}} technique of justification of judicial decisions. We distinguish two uses and versions of it, strong and weak, taking as example the normative sentence “Underprivileged citizens {{are permitted to}} apply for State benefit”. According to the strong version, only underprivileged citizens are permitted to apply for State benefit, so stateless persons are not. According to the weak, {{the law does not}} regulate the position of underprivileged stateless persons in this respect. We propose an inferential analysis of the two uses {{along the lines of the}} scorekeeping practice as described by Robert Brandom, and try to point out what are the ontological assumptions of the two. We conclude that the strong version is justified if and only if there is a relevant incompatibility between the regulated subject and the present case...|$|E

In {{this paper}} it is shown how defeasible argumentation schemes {{can be used}} to {{represent}} the logical structure of the thirteen types of ar-guments recognized as important for statutory interpretation by (Tarello 1980). It is shown that the process of statutory interpretation has a distinctive argumentative structure where the conclusion, namely, the meaning attributed to a legal source, is a claim that needs to be sup-ported by pro and contra defeasible arguments. This transformation of the arguments of interpretation into the argumentation schemes frame-work is applied to the psychological and the <b>a</b> <b>contrario</b> <b>arguments,</b> as leading examples to follow. The defeasible nature of each scheme is shown by means of critical questions, which identify the default conditions for the accepting interpretative arguments and provide a method for evalu-ating a given argument as weak or strong...|$|R

By as-suming local linearity, we first employ a robust algorithm to model the local manifold of the corrupted data by local line segments.

40|$|Abstract—Edge {{detection}} {{remains an}} active {{problem in the}} image processing community, {{because of the high}} complexity of natural images. In the last decade, Desolneux et al. proposed a novel detection approach, parameter free, based on the Helmhotz principle. Applied to the edge detection field, this means that observing a true edge in random and independent conditions is very unlikely, and then considered as meaningful. However, overdetection may occur, partly due to the use of a single pixelwise feature. In this paper, we propose to introduce higher level information in the <b>a</b> <b>contrario</b> framework, by computing several features along a set of connected pixels (an edgelet).

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} a statistical method {{to decide whether}} two blocks {{in a pair of}} images match reliably. The method ensures that the selected block matches are unlikely to have occurred “just by chance. ” The new approach is based on the definition of a simple but faithful statistical background model for image blocks learned from the image itself. A theorem guarantees that under this model not more than a fixed number of wrong matches occurs (on average) for the whole image. This fixed number (the number of false alarms) is the only method parameter. Furthermore, the number of false alarms associated with each match measures its reliability. This <b>a</b> <b>contrario</b> block-matching method, however, cannot rule out false matches due to the presence of periodic objects in the images. But it is successfully complemented by a parameterless self-similarity threshold.
