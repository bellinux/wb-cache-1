If it's so important, why not have a former pitcher as manager? He can always have someone else run the other 25 per cent of the club." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, West became {{general manager}} of the Memphis Grizzlies. He {{explained}} his decision with the desire for exploring something new: [...] "After being a part of the Lakers success for so many years, I have <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> how it would be to build a winning franchise that has not experienced much success. I want to help make a difference." [...] West's Memphis stint was not as spectacular as his Los Angeles stint, but he turned a franchise which was about to be sold into a reliable playoffs team, practically making no trades but getting the maximum from the players he had available (e.g. Pau Gasol, James Posey and Jason Williams) and signing coach Hubie Brown, who became Coach of the Year in 2004. West himself won his second NBA Executive of the Year Award in the same year. At age 69, West retired as a Grizzlies general manager in 2007 and turned over managing duties to Chris Wallace, from Buckhannon, West Virginia.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{partially}} {{inspired by the}} commercials for the Christian Children's Fund, in which Sally Struthers encourages viewers to donate money to provide food for starving children in Africa. Parker {{said he did not}} really believe Struthers was hoarding food from the charity, but he came up with the concept because he found it funny that such an obese woman would make a public plea for food for others. Parker said he had <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> how a starving African child would react if they were taken to a large buffet dinner at an American restaurant, with [...] "people leaving tons of food on their plates", which served as further inspiration for the episode. Parker and Stone originally planned for Struthers to die {{at the end of the}} episode and have the African children eat her and live off her fat; Comedy Central executives told the duo they could not kill Struthers, although celebrities have been killed off in subsequent episodes without any objections from the network.|$|E

500|$|August Brown for the Los Angeles Times {{said that}} [...] "'Cheers (Drink to That)' and 'Raining Men,' as foamy and spunky {{as they may}} be, are such a dogleg turn from Rated R that they come off {{as little more than}} image recalibration. That's her {{prerogative}} as an artist, and it's certainly earned. But it underscores the one thing we've <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> about Rihanna — what is she really feeling?". Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media was more critical of the song, commenting that [...] "Raining Men is a shameless Beyoncé rip-off that would be quickly dismissed if not for the fact that it's a pretty-damn-good Beyoncé rip off with a characteristically scene-stealing guest verse from Nicki Minaj". James Reed of The Boston Globe also noticed the similarity between the song's composition and the work of American R recording artist Beyoncé Knowles, saying [...] "'Raining Men', borrowing a digitized riff from Beyoncé's 'Diva', features rising rapper Nicki Minaj on a typically manic guest rhyme. The song's message doubles as the album's mantra: Some cats really do have nine lives". Idolator reviewer Becky Bain praised Minaj's [...] "infectious and energetic verse" [...] and felt the song's rhythm [...] "fits Nicki's quirkiness perfectly".|$|E
500|$|Derricotte {{was born}} in Fostoria, Ohio on June 14, 1926, and {{he grew up in}} Defiance, Ohio, where his father Clarence Cobb Derricotte ran a shoe repair business. In {{addition}} to Eugene, Bessie M. Anderson and Clarence Derricotte had two other sons, Bruce (b. June 22, 1928) and Raymond. [...] Gene married Jeanne E. Hagans and had a son Robert. [...] Years later, Gene Derricotte would tell a reporter friend of his that he <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> about his ancestry. [...] He knew his name was French, but {{he was not able to}} find out much more about his roots. [...] One thing he must have known was that despite living under segregation, other members of the Derricotte family had distinguished themselves as educated professionals. A black newspaper, the Philadelphia Tribune, did a tribute to the family in November 1944, mentioning that Eugene's father was a veteran of World War I where he fought in France before returning to Defiance to open his business, marry and raise a family. [...] Eugene had an uncle (J. Flipper Derricotte) who was an attorney in Washington DC, and an aunt Juliette who had been a dean at Fisk College in Nashville TN before dying tragically after an automobile accident, when the nearby white hospital refused to admit her.

2500|$|I think Walter is {{a writer}} at heart. Writers aren't always that good at {{communicating}} in person. He's also a tough son-of-a-bitch. He's like a cowboy. His director's chair was made out of leather and {{on the back of}} it read [...] "Lone Wolf". [...] He used to frequent gun clubs and he wasn't a very delicate guy.... We were doing a love scene. When they said, [...] "We need to ADR the love scene." [...] I really freaked out. I had never done a love scene before... I really needed help to get through it. I panicked, and the Producer... Joel Silver, called Walter and somehow persuaded him to come over and direct me through the ADR. Streets of Fire was a big picture for me, and I was overwhelmed. I think that bothered Walter. I think he thought that I was a needy guy. He was used to working with actors who had experience like Nick Nolte or David Carradine. I've <b>always</b> <b>wondered</b> why Walter has never wanted to work with me again. I think he was too much of gentlemen to tell me that I was too needy at the time.|$|E
