Schneiderman reached {{a settlement with}} the companies in March 2016, under which DraftKings and FanDuel agreed to stop operating in New York until September 2016 and Schneiderman agreed to drop all of the state's suits against DraftKings and FanDuel—except for a false advertising claim against FanDuel—if the New York State Legislature passed legislation legalizing daily fantasy sports by the <b>adjournment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session.</b>|$|E
50|$|Legislation {{that would}} change the state {{constitution}} {{takes the form of}} a constitutional amendment. A constitutional amendment is introduced and takes the same course as a bills or resolution, except it must be read at length on three different days in each house, must pass each house by a three-fifths vote of the membership, and it does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Alabama Secretary of State. It is then submitted to voters at an election held not less than three months after the <b>adjournment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session</b> in which state lawmakers proposed the amendment. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the Alabama Constitution. The result of the election is announced by proclamation of the governor.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{what the}} {{legislature}} wishes to accomplish cannot be done simply by {{the passage of}} a bill, but rather requires amending the Constitution. A bill or joint resolution is accordingly drafted to propose an appropriate amendment to the Constitution. This bill or joint resolution is introduced {{in the same manner as}} other bills and resolutions, and follows the course of ordinary bills, except that it must be read at length on three different days in each house. Furthermore, it must be passed in each house by a three-fifths vote of all the members elected, and does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Secretary of State. It is then submitted to the voters of the state at an election (the time of which is fixed by the Legislature), held not less than three months after the <b>adjournment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>session</b> in which the amendment was proposed. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the Constitution. The result of the election is announced by proclamation of the governor.|$|E

50|$|Kayatta's {{confirmation}} {{hearing before the}} Senate Judiciary Committee was uncontroversial.

2500|$|What exactly {{constitutes}} an <b>adjournment</b> for <b>the</b> purposes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pocket veto has been unclear. In the Pocket Veto Case (1929), the Supreme Court held that [...] "the determinative question {{in reference to}} an 'adjournment' is not {{whether it is a}} final <b>adjournment</b> <b>of</b> Congress or an interim adjournment, such as an <b>adjournment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>session,</b> but whether it is one that 'prevents' the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated within the time allowed." [...] Since neither House of Congress was in <b>session,</b> <b>the</b> President could not return the bill to one of them, thereby permitting <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pocket veto. In Wright v. United States (1938), however, the Court ruled that <b>adjournments</b> <b>of</b> one House only did not constitute an <b>adjournment</b> <b>of</b> Congress required for a pocket veto. In such cases, the Secretary or Clerk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House in question was ruled competent to receive the bill.|$|R

If a passed bill is not vetoed, it becomes law. The budget bill, however, becomes law upon its final passage and cannot be vetoed. Constitutional amendments also cannot be vetoed; they become law only upon their ratification by the voters at the next general election.|$|R

5000|$|In 2006, {{while still}} a Liberal, Backs {{sponsored}} the Labour Relations Code (First Collective Agreement) Amendment Act, a private member's bill {{designed to provide}} a first collective bargaining agreement after <b>the</b> certification <b>of</b> a union, to prevent <b>the</b> sort <b>of</b> labour conflict that had recently occurred between Lakeside Packers and the United Food and Commercial Workers.

60|$|The ten regiments {{which had}} volunteered in the State service for thirty days, {{it will be}} remembered, had done so with a pledge {{to go into the}} National service if called upon within that time. When they volunteered the {{government}} had only called for ninety days' enlistments. Men were called now for three years or the war. They felt that this change of period released them from <b>the</b> obligation <b>of</b> re-volunteering. When I was appointed colonel, the 21st regiment was still in the State service. About the time they were to be mustered into the United States service, such of them as would go, two members <b>of</b> Congress from <b>the</b> State, McClernand and Logan, appeared at the capital and I was introduced to them. I had never seen either of them before, but I had read a great deal about them, and particularly about Logan, in the newspapers. Both were democratic members of Congress, and Logan had been elected from <b>the</b> southern district <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State, where he had a majority of eighteen thousand over his Republican competitor. His district had been settled originally by people from the Southern States, and at <b>the</b> breaking out <b>of</b> secession they sympathized with the South. At <b>the</b> first outbreak <b>of</b> war some <b>of</b> them joined <b>the</b> Southern army; many others were preparing to do so; others rode over the country at night denouncing the Union, and made it as necessary to guard railroad bridges over which National troops had to pass in southern Illinois, as it was in Kentucky or any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> border slave states. Logan's popularity in this district was unbounded. He knew almost enough <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people in it by their Christian names, to form an ordinary congressional district. As he went in politics, so his district was sure to go. The Republican papers had been demanding that he should announce where he stood on the questions which at that time engrossed <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> public thought. Some were very bitter in their denunciations of his silence. Logan was not a man to be coerced into an utterance by threats. He did, however, come out in a speech before <b>the</b> <b>adjournment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> special <b>session</b> <b>of</b> Congress which was convened by the President soon after his inauguration, and announced his undying loyalty and devotion to the Union. But I had not happened to see that speech, so that when I first met Logan my impressions were those formed from reading denunciations of him. McClernand, on the other hand, had early taken strong grounds for <b>the</b> maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union and had been praised accordingly by the Republican papers. The gentlemen who presented these two members of Congress asked me if I would have any objections to their addressing my regiment. I hesitated a little before answering. It was but {{a few days before the}} time set for mustering into the United States service such <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men as were willing to volunteer for three years or the war. I had some doubt as to the effect a speech from Logan might have; but as he was with McClernand, whose sentiments on <b>the</b> all-absorbing questions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day were well known, I gave my consent. McClernand spoke first; and Logan followed in a speech which he has hardly equalled since for force and eloquence. It breathed a loyalty and devotion to the Union which inspired my men to such a point that they would have volunteered to remain in the army as long as an enemy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country continued to bear arms against it. They entered the United States service almost to a man.|$|R
