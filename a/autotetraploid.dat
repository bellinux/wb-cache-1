Babcock and Stebbins also observed that allopolyploid types formed from the hybridization of two different species always have a wider distribution than diploid or <b>autotetraploid</b> species, and proposed that polyploids formed through hybridization have a greater potential to exploit varied environments, because they inherit all traits from both parents. They also showed that hybridization in the polyploid complex could provide a mechanism for genetic exchange between diploid species that were otherwise unable to breed.

2500|$|Allopolyploids or amphipolyploids or heteropolyploids [...] are polyploids with {{chromosomes}} {{derived from}} {{two or more}} diverged taxa. As in autopolyploidy, this primarily occurs through the fusion of unreduced (2n) gametes, which can take place before or after hybridization. In the former case, unreduced gametes from each diploid taxa – or reduced gametes from two <b>autotetraploid</b> taxa – combine to form allopolyploid offspring. In the latter case, one or more diploid F1 hybrids produce unreduced gametes that fuse to form allopolyploid progeny. Hybridization followed by genome duplication {{may be a more}} common path to allopolyploidy because F1 hybrids between taxa often have relatively high rates of unreduced gamete formation – divergence between the genomes of the two taxa result in abnormal pairing between homoeologous chromosomes or nondisjunction during meiosis. In this case, allopolyploidy can actually restore normal, bivalent meiotic pairing by providing each homoeologous chromosome with its own homologue. If divergence between homoeologous chromosomes is even across the two subgenomes, this can theoretically result in rapid restoration of bivalent pairing and disomic inheritance following allopolyploidization. However multivalent pairing is common in many recently formed allopolyploids, so {{it is likely that the}} majority of meiotic stabilization occurs gradually through selection.|$|E

Using two-dimensional electrophoresis approximately 910 protein spots were reproducibly detected in control and salt-stressed leaves of all genotypes. Among them, 44 protein spots showing significant variations at least in one genotype were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis for identification. Salt-responsive proteins were involved in several functions, including photosynthetic processes, ROS scavenging, stress defence, and signalling. Genotype factors affect the salt-responsive pattern, especially that of carbon metabolism. The no ion accumulator 'Cleopatra' mandarin genotype showed the highest number of salt-responsive proteins, and up-regulation of Calvin cycle-related proteins. Conversely the ion accumulator 'Willow leaf' mandarin showed high levels of several photorespiration-related enzymes. A common set of proteins (twelve spots) displayed higher levels in salt-stressed leaves of 2 × and 4 × 'Cleopatra' and 4 × 'Willow leaf' mandarin. Interestingly, antioxidant enzymes and heat shock proteins showed higher constitutive levels in 4 × 'Cleopatra' mandarin and 4 × 'Willow leaf' mandarin compared with the cognate 2 × genotype.
