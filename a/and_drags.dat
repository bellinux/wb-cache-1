5|$|Most tornadoes from supercells {{follow a}} {{recognizable}} life cycle. That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it {{an area of}} quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, <b>and</b> <b>drags</b> the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.|$|E

When Venkatapathy arrives, Ramana feigns mental illness while Ammadu and Raja {{pretend to be a}} nurse and a doctor.

40|$|Abstract. The added mass, <b>drag</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> {{coefficient}} of a uniform and accelerated motion projectile in viscous incompressible fluid were calculated by numerical simulation and dynamic mesh method. The effect of velocity and acceleration was investigated. The {{results show that}} the variation rules of added mass, <b>drag</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient are basically the same when the projectile moves at different speeds. The added mass, <b>drag</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient become smaller <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> becomes bigger with the increase of speed. The variation rules of the added mass, <b>drag</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient are the same as uniform motion when the projectile moves at different accelerations. The added mass <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient become smaller <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> becomes bigger with the increase of acceleration. These reveal that the motion region, velocity and acceleration have some effect on the added mass, <b>drag</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient...|$|R

5|$|In the video, Candy {{is shown}} {{living with a}} cult on a farm {{populated}} by abused women and a tyrannical man. Candy and the other women are seen performing various chores around the house. The man demands that the women prepare dinner, <b>and</b> <b>drags</b> one of them outside by her hair. These opening sequences are accompanied by {{the sounds of a}} piano, the women's cooking knives, and the man's ax. The women seek vengeance against the man, removing all of their clothing, confronting him while he is chopping wood, and shooting him with golden rifles. Following the man's death, the women have dinner together while wearing latex clothing. The visual also includes scenes of Candy posing with a white horse while wearing oversized hats and holding decorated machine guns. During these scenes, Candy is shown only wearing a bodystocking, and in some instances a large chastity belt. To accommodate restrictions regarding censorship, Candy's nipples are airbrushed out of the shots.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Clemens (Charles Dance) is Fury 161's doctor. When Ripley {{crashes into}} the oil sea, he nurses {{her back to}} health and shows her around. Clemens {{performs}} an autopsy on Newt at Ripley's request, although he is annoyed at not being told why. To gain Ripley's trust, Clemens admits that he got drunk after a long shift as a resident and accidentally killed eleven men being treated after a boiler explosion by misprescribing a painkiller. Sentenced to Fiorina 161, he served his time but remained behind with the other inmates when they refused to leave. Ripley still does not reveal {{the true nature of}} the events taking place; as Clemens injects her with a serum, the Alien kills him <b>and</b> <b>drags</b> his body away.|$|E

Though Henriette refuses her drink, Maloin buys her an expensive mink stole. They return home {{to the consternation of}} Camélia, who cannot comprehend why Maloin has ruined Henriette's chances of a job and spent what little savings the family had on the extravagant stole.

Nollette admits to stealing Grable's work and prepares to shoot Roland, but is distracted by some equations. Roland strikes him with a computer keyboard <b>and</b> <b>drags</b> him into the wind tunnel. The agents arrive in time to convince Roland not to kill Nollette. At the same time, the rising temperatures in the storage unit kill Grable. Roland is removed from the care home, to be taken to a psychiatric institute for testing. However, as he leaves he stops to comb his hair in a style reminiscent of his brother, raising the question of whether he is actually free of Grable's control.|$|E
5|$|Stan {{tries to}} persuade Randy {{to tell the}} truth about the stolen magnet, but Randy refuses in order to avoid embarrassment. As the pair works on the warp drive, an Intergalactic Police ship {{approaches}} Earth; McGeezax cloaks his ship <b>and</b> <b>drags</b> Stan out of sight as a hostage, leaving the townspeople to divert the officers' questions. The officers say that McGeezax stole a large sum of space cash, but no one admits to seeing him, and the officers leave. Randy then provides a diversion for McGeezax while Stan, at Randy's insistence, stabs him to death with a shank. McGeezax's ship is found to contain the stolen space cash, but instead of returning it, Randy persuades everyone to divide it among themselves. Randy, in contact with all world leaders, buys other countries' silence by giving them a share. Four days later, the officers return to South Park. They now know that McGeezax landed here and Randy tells them of his death, but everyone denies finding any space cash.|$|E

50|$|Though very {{uncommon}} in the United States, Stag <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> is held {{before the wedding}} of a couple as a big party open to all friends.

Anyone can attend - the more guests, the better. Stag <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> could be conducted from many months before the wedding, to a couple of weeks before. The stag <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> party could include food, drink, games, music, dancing, bonfire and other fun activities. Guests could be offered memorabilia such as an engraved cup with the couple's names and wedding date.|$|R

Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending her back against the trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate <b>and</b> <b>drags</b> away Sean's body.|$|E

Wesley is forced to leave the scared man inside <b>and</b> <b>drags</b> the other man to safety. Outside the room, he soon realizes this was the psychological test. Eventually, the cadets are told of the results, and Mordock is granted admission into Starfleet Academy, while Wesley is encouraged to try again next year.

Squirrelflight begs him to let them through, but Ashfur tells her and the other three that he never forgave her after she left him for Brambleclaw. He said that he will now kill her kits in another attempt to hurt her. Squirrelflight then reveals a crucial secret: that he cannot hurt her that way because they are not her kits. She {{explains}} how she kept the secret from Brambleclaw and the whole of ThunderClan. Ashfur lets them live, but he threatens to tell her secret, and she is shocked that Ashfur would betray her like this. Knowing this, Jayfeather, Hollyleaf and Lionblaze realize they are not the Three since they are not the kin of Firestar.|$|E

40|$|The {{calculation}} {{and analysis}} of torque <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> {{play an important role}} in drilling and well design. Different models (soft, stiffness, mixed and finite element) have been used to calculate the torque <b>and</b> <b>drag.</b> This paper introduces a practical FEA (Finite Element Analysis) model of the drill string which can reflect working behavior, including interaction between the drillstring and borehole wall, computational model of torque <b>and</b> <b>drag,</b> <b>and</b> verification with examples. The sensitivity analysis to some key input and output parameters has been conducted. The calculated hook load shows a good match to the rig recorded values. The drillstring displacements calculated by the FEA model matches those from an analytical method. The program developed and discussed in this paper can be used for torque <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> analysis, dynamic behavior analysis, and friction coefficient back-calculation. The FEA program of the drillstring presented herein will benefit in preplanning and real-time simulation of oil and gas well drilling operations. </p...|$|R
