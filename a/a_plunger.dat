5|$|American {{inventor}} John Wesley Hyatt {{together with}} his brother Isaiah, Hyatt patented the first injection moulding machine in 1872. This machine was relatively simple compared to machines in use today: it worked like a large hypodermic needle, using <b>a</b> <b>plunger</b> to inject plastic through a heated cylinder into a mould. The industry progressed slowly over the years, producing products such as collar stays, buttons, and hair combs.|$|E
25|$|Solenoids or coils: These {{are found}} in every modern pinball machine since the flipper age. They are usually hidden under the playfield, or covered by playfield components. By {{applying}} power to the coil, the magnetic field created by electromagnetism causes a metal object (usually called <b>a</b> <b>plunger)</b> to move. The plunger is then connected mechanically to a feature or accessory on the playfield.|$|E

25|$|The C11 used a C10 motor {{fitted with}} an {{overhead}} valve cylinder head. The C11 frame was almost unchanged until 1951 when BSA added plunger rear suspension. Early gearboxes were weak and unreliable. The C11G was available with a three ratio gearbox and rigid frame or a four ratio gearbox and <b>a</b> <b>plunger</b> frame. Both models had better front brakes than earlier models. This model {{was a common}} commuter motorcycle, and many survive today.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong was {{responsible}} for developing the hydraulic accumulator. Where water pressure was not available on site {{for the use of}} hydraulic cranes, Armstrong often built high water towers to provide a supply of water at pressure. However, when supplying cranes for use at New Holland on the Humber Estuary, he was unable to do this because the foundations consisted of sand. After much careful thought he produced the weighted accumulator, a cast-iron cylinder fitted with <b>a</b> <b>plunger</b> supporting a very heavy weight. The plunger would slowly be raised, drawing in water, until the downward force of the weight was sufficient to force the water below it into pipes at great pressure. The accumulator was a very significant, if unspectacular, invention, which found many applications in the following years.|$|E
25|$|Coffee may be brewed by {{steeping}} in {{a device}} {{such as a}} French press (also known as a cafetière, coffee press or coffee plunger). Ground coffee and hot water are combined in a cylindrical vessel and left to brew for a few minutes. A circular filter which fits tightly in the cylinder fixed to <b>a</b> <b>plunger</b> is then pushed {{down from the top}} to force the grounds to the bottom. The filter retains the grounds at the bottom as the coffee is poured from the container. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the water, all the coffee oils remain in the liquid, making it a stronger beverage. This method of brewing leaves more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine. Supporters of the French press method point out that the sediment issue can be minimized by using the right type of grinder: they claim that a rotary blade grinder cuts the coffee bean into a wide range of sizes, including a fine coffee dust that remains as sludge {{at the bottom of the}} cup, while a burr grinder uniformly grinds the beans into consistently-sized grinds, allowing the coffee to settle uniformly and be trapped by the press. Within the first minute of brewing 95% of the caffeine is released from the coffee bean.|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{vibrations}} {{and flow}} fluctuation {{give rise to}} complex interactive vibration mechanisms in hydraulic pumps. The working conditions for a hydraulic pump are therefore required to be improved in the design stage or as early as possible. Considering the structural features, parameters, and operating environment of <b>a</b> hydraulic <b>plunger</b> pump, the vibration modes for two-degree-of-freedom system were established by using vibration theory and hydraulic technology. Afterwards, the analytical form of the natural frequency and the numerical solution of the steady-state response were deduced for <b>a</b> hydraulic <b>plunger</b> pump. Then, <b>a</b> method for the vibration analysis of a hydraulic pump was proposed. Finally, the dynamic responses of <b>a</b> hydraulic <b>plunger</b> pump are obtained through numerical simulation...|$|R

500|$|Grissom stated he {{had done}} nothing to cause the hatch to blow. Robert F. Thompson, Director of Mercury Operations, was {{dispatched}} to the [...] by Space Task Group Director Robert Gilruth and spoke with Grissom upon his arrival on the aircraft carrier. Grissom explained that he had gotten ahead in the mission timeline and had removed the detonator cap, and also pulled the safety pin. Once the pin was removed, the trigger was no longer held in place and could have inadvertently fired {{as a result of}} ocean wave action, bobbing as a result of helicopter rotor wash, or other activity. NASA officials concluded Grissom had not necessarily initiated the firing of the explosive hatch, which would have required pressing <b>a</b> <b>plunger</b> that required five pounds of force to depress.|$|E

500|$|Inertance has {{the same}} units as mass (kilograms in the SI system) and the name {{indicates}} its relationship to inertia. [...] Smith did not just define a network theoretic element, he also suggested a construction for a real mechanical component and made a small prototype. [...] Smith's inerter consists of <b>a</b> <b>plunger</b> able to slide {{in or out of}} a cylinder. [...] The plunger is connected to a rack and pinion gear which drives a flywheel inside the cylinder. [...] There can be two counter-rotating flywheels in order to prevent a torque developing. [...] Energy provided in pushing the plunger in will be returned when the plunger moves in the opposite direction, hence the device stores energy rather than dissipates it just like a block of mass. [...] However, the actual mass of the inerter can be very small, an ideal inerter has no mass. [...] Two points on the inerter, the plunger and the cylinder case, can be independently connected {{to other parts of the}} mechanical system with neither of them necessarily connected to ground.|$|E

500|$|For Mortal Kombat X, Ermac was {{designed}} with a slimmer figure and his mask exposing {{more of his}} face, revealing decaying skin.

Ermac's [...] "Inner Workings" [...] Fatality (a finishing move that executes defeated opponents) in the game has him levitate his opponent, break their spine in midair, and then telekinetically pull their gastrointestinal tract out from their mouth.

Robert Christgau gave a mixed review of the song. R. Serge Denisoff and William D.

2500|$|The soda-acid {{extinguisher}} {{was first}} patented in 1866 by Francois Carlier of France, which mixed {{a solution of}} water and sodium bicarbonate with tartaric acid, producing the propellant CO2 gas. A soda-acid extinguisher was patented in the U.S. in 1881 by Almon M. Granger. His extinguisher used the reaction between sodium bicarbonate solution and sulfuric acid to expel pressurized water onto a fire. A vial of concentrated sulfuric acid was suspended in the cylinder. Depending {{on the type of}} extinguisher, the vial of acid could be broken in one of two ways. One used <b>a</b> <b>plunger</b> to break the acid vial, while the second released a lead stopple that held the vial closed. Once the acid was mixed with the bicarbonate solution, carbon dioxide gas was expelled and thereby pressurized the water. [...] The pressurized water was forced from the canister through a nozzle or short length of hose.|$|E
2500|$|This engine has {{electronic}} hydraulic activation {{in order}} to increase flexibility with regard to fuel injection and exhaust valve activation.
