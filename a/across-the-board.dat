5|$|If the Saxbe fix is a {{solution}} for the primary problem of self-dealing, a relevant fact is that Congress has not voted to increase any Cabinet salary or benefits since the 1990s, when it granted that power to {{the president in the}} form of an <b>across-the-board</b> cost of living adjustment by executive order. However, the Ineligibility Clause does not distinguish between increases in emoluments by legislation, and increases by executive order. Perhaps the most lenient interpretation of self-dealing was made during the 1973 Saxbe hearings by Duke University School of Law professor William Van Alstyne, who argued that the ineligibility clause only applied to new offices created during a congressional term, not to appointments to existing offices.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 2010, {{the day of}} President Barack Obama's State of the Union address, Ryan reintroduced a {{modified}} version of his Roadmap, H.R. 4529: Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2010. The modified plan would have provided <b>across-the-board</b> tax cuts by reducing income tax rates; eliminating income taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest; and abolishing the estate tax and Alternative Minimum Tax. The plan would also have replaced the corporate income tax with a border-adjusted business consumption tax of 8.5%. The plan would have privatized a portion of Social Security and reduced benefits for those under 55, eliminated the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance, and privatized Medicare and Medicaid.|$|E

25|$|Weldon also co-authored the Family Medical Leave Act, {{pushed for}} the {{extension}} of unemployment benefits, has consistently supported raising the minimum wage, opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, and voted for <b>across-the-board</b> tax cuts.

25|$|While International Harvester {{was forced}} to cut costs, the United Auto Workers {{improved}} its financial position. On January 30, 1980, the union gave striking workers a $15-a-week <b>across-the-board</b> increase in strike benefits, raising the benefit to $55 {{a week for a}} single worker and $65 a week for married workers with dependents.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{took advantage of}} AUPE’s weakened condition, opening bargaining in 1994 by announcing <b>across-the-board</b> cutbacks of five per cent in the government service, plus boards and agencies that depended on government for funding. After an extended campaign, AUPE ratified agreements containing cutbacks {{in the order of}} 2.3 per cent, with the remainder taken in days off and holidays.|$|E
25|$|In the 2012-2013 school year, MSU {{implemented}} the faculty contracts' 2 percent <b>across-the-board</b> pay increase. Another $500,000 {{was spent in}} pay increases for faculty who were promoted, and merit pay salary increases. With enrollment expanding rapidly, Cruzado agreed to hire 18 tenure-track faculty and six adjunct faculty, and to fill 37 tenure-track and 17 adjunct positions.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s were characterised by {{two major}} developments: {{expansion}} of the international network and <b>across-the-board</b> introduction of IT facilities to cope with extension of the customer base {{and the development of}} deposit money. In 1971, the appearance of automatic cash machines crowned the success and development of the credit card. In 1973, Société Générale opened its representative office in the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|With {{negotiations}} derailed and {{a strike}} imminent, the government introduced legislation on October 5 {{to extend the}} previous contract {{through the end of}} the school year—June 2006—at which time the <b>across-the-board</b> wage freeze would be revisited. After a filibuster by the official opposition BC NDP, Bill 12 passed on October 7. Furthermore, the BCPSEA successfully applied to the British Columbia Labour Relations Board (BCLRB) to deem any strike action illegal.|$|E
25|$|The {{department}} had 693 full-time equivalent employees in May 2009, of which 197 were seasonal or temporary. These include 74 field game wardens, six uniformed investigators, and three covert investigators {{in addition to}} a number of game sergeants and game captains. In April 2010, Governor Brian Schweitzer asked state agencies for a 4 percent <b>across-the-board</b> reduction in personnel. However, the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks was exempt from the personnel reductions since most of its revenues came from hunting and fishing licenses.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 Donnelly {{voted against}} H.R. 2219 {{which would have}} cut the U.S. {{military}} budget by $8.5 billion, stipulating that no cuts were to be taken from pay or benefit programs supporting members and veterans of the armed forces. These cuts would have reduced the emphasis of the U.S. budget on weapons programs. Donnelly also voted against the failed Polis amendment, cutting $640 Million in a 2% <b>across-the-board</b> reduction in spending from the 2012 Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the HKEAA {{decided on}} an <b>across-the-board</b> revamp upon {{the format of}} {{questions}} in the exam. The changes included the replacement of questions on prescribed texts with open-ended questions in the questions on culture paper. It was HKEAA's attempt to prevent candidates from memorising the suggested reading materials. That, however, was dismissed {{by a number of}} candidates as a move towards the subject turning out into a saliva subject (吹水科, Jyutping: Ceoi1 Seoi2 Fo1) in which candidates concentrate on writing large amounts of verbose text and neglect the actual quality of the contents.|$|E
25|$|Under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, {{allowable}} deficit {{levels were}} calculated for the eventual elimination of the federal deficit. If the budget exceeded the allowable deficit, <b>across-the-board</b> cuts were required. Directors of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) were required {{to report to the}} Comptroller General regarding their recommendations for how much must be cut. The Comptroller General then evaluated these reports, made his own conclusion, and gave a recommendation to the President, who was then required to issue an order effecting the reductions required by the Comptroller General unless Congress made the required cuts by other ways within a specified amount of time.|$|E
25|$|Although Toledo {{originally}} promised tax cuts, violent protests {{by civil}} servants prompted {{the increase in}} social sector spending that Toledo had also promised, which necessitated tax increases. To tackle tax reform in June 2003, he brought in Peru’s first female prime minister, Beatriz Merino who quickly submitted proposals to the congress. Among the suggestions were pay cuts for higher-paid public-sector officials, including a 30% salary reduction for Toledo himself, a 5% <b>across-the-board</b> cut for all agencies and ministries, tax increases on beer, cigarettes and fuel, and {{an extension of the}} 18% sales and value-added tax to, among other things, long-distance bus journeys and live entertainment. The final package also included the elimination of tax breaks, the introduction of a minimum corporate tax, the closing of tax loopholes for the rich, and the strengthening of local government realestate tax regimes.|$|E
25|$|One major {{hallmark}} of McNamara's cost reductions was {{the consolidation of}} programs from different services, most visibly in aircraft acquisition, believing that the redundancy created waste and unnecessary spending. McNamara directed the Air Force to adopt the Navy's F-4 Phantom and A-7 Corsair combat aircraft, a consolidation that was quite successful. Conversely, his actions in mandating a premature <b>across-the-board</b> adoption of the untested M16 rifle proved catastrophic when the weapons began to fail in combat. McNamara tried to extend his success by merging development programs as well, resulting in the TFX dual service F-111 project. It was to combine Navy requirements for an Fleet Air Defense (FAD) aircraft and Air Force requirements for a tactical bomber. His experience {{in the corporate world}} led him to believe that adopting a single type for different missions and service would save money. He insisted on the General Dynamics entry over the DOD's preference for Boeing because of commonality issues. Though heralded as a fighter that could do everything (fast supersonic dash, slow carrier and short airfield landings, tactical strike, and even close air support), in the end it involved too many compromises to succeed at any of them. The Navy version was drastically overweight and difficult to land, and eventually canceled after a Grumman study showed it was incapable of matching the abilities of the newly revealed Soviet MiG-23 and MiG-25 aircraft. The F-111 would eventually find its niche as a tactical bomber and electronic warfare aircraft with the Air Force.|$|E

500|$|Kemp had a {{reputation}} as the highest-profile progressive Republican. When Dole declined an invitation to speak to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, he suggested Kemp as a substitute even before Kemp had become the Vice Presidential nominee. On August 5, 1996, Dole announced a 15% <b>across-the-board</b> tax cut in response to both the Forbes campaign and Kemp's tax reform commission. Several of Dole's other campaign ideas came from Kemp and Bill Bennett's Empower America, which had Jeane Kirkpatrick, Weber, Forbes and Alexander as principals. For example, Dole borrowed Kirkpatrick's tough foreign policy, Bennett's [...] "right conduct" [...] and even Alexander's school choice interest.|$|E
500|$|Collins {{announced}} a new education package in June 1985 that included a five percent <b>across-the-board</b> pay raise for teachers, a reduction in class sizes, funding for construction projects, aides for every kindergarten teacher in the state, and a [...] "power equalization" [...] program to make funding for poorer school districts more {{equal to that of}} their more affluent counterparts. After favorable reaction to the plan from legislators, she called a special legislative session to convene July 8 to consider the plan. After two weeks of deliberation, the General Assembly approved Collins' education plan, tripling the corporate licensing tax to $2.10 per $1,000 in order to pay for the package. The Assembly rejected a proposed five-cents-per-gallon increase in the state gasoline tax to finance other spending.|$|E
500|$|The party did {{not have}} much electoral success at first, and was stable at one seat in the 1981 general elections. It stood {{candidates}} in very few communities, and was active almost entirely in the city of Antwerp. Having been founded mainly as a protest against the Egmont pact, the party revamped and broadened its platform after the pact collapsed. It did not make much progress in the 1985 general elections, and Dillen thus started the so-called [...] "Operation Rejuvenation", allowing for an <b>across-the-board</b> change of the party leadership, integrating many leaders of nationalist youth and student organisations into the party council. The party's youth organisation, the Vlaams Blok Jongeren (VBJ), was founded in 1987 by among others Filip Dewinter and Frank Vanhecke.|$|E
500|$|On December 15, 2011, a {{deal was}} reached on the {{remaining}} nine appropriations bills, which were combined into the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012. [...] One point of contention was that an earlier draft of the bill supported by Republicans contained new restrictions on travel to Cuba, which had been relaxed by the Obama administration in 2009. [...] These restrictions were removed in the enacted bill {{at the insistence of}} the Obama administration. [...] A separate Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2012 was also included in the package, as well as a concurrent resolution which offset the increased disaster funding by imposing a 1.83% <b>across-the-board</b> spending cut to all discretionary programs except Defense and Veterans Affairs. [...] Two more continuing resolutions were also passed, one extending the deadline by one day so that the Senate could vote on the package, and one until December 23, 2011. [...] The two appropriations bills were enacted on December 23, 2011, but the concurrent resolution failed in the Senate.|$|E
500|$|Reagan {{implemented}} policies {{based on}} supply-side economics, advocating a laissez-faire philosophy and free-market fiscal policy, seeking {{to stimulate the}} economy with large, <b>across-the-board</b> tax cuts. He also supported returning the United States to some sort of gold standard, and successfully urged Congress to establish the U.S. Gold Commission to study how one could be implemented. Citing the economic theories of Arthur Laffer, Reagan promoted the proposed tax cuts as potentially stimulating the economy enough to expand the tax base, offsetting the revenue loss due to reduced rates of taxation, a theory that entered political discussion as the Laffer curve. Reaganomics was the subject of debate with supporters pointing to improvements in certain key economic indicators as evidence of success, and critics pointing to large increases in federal budget deficits and the national debt. His policy of [...] "peace through strength" [...] resulted in a record peacetime defense buildup including a 40% real increase in defense spending between 1981 and 1985.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the federal}} budget {{legislation}} was {{not expected to be}} enacted by the September 30, 2011 deadline, work began on a continuing resolution to fund the government temporarily through November 18, 2011 with an <b>across-the-board</b> reduction of 1.503% below the 2011 budget levels. [...] However, a dispute arose between the Republican-led House and the Democrat-led Senate over the amount of additional funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for costs associated with relief from Hurricane Irene, and whether this extra funding should be partially offset with cuts elsewhere. [...] FEMA's disaster relief fund had $792 million remaining in it just prior to the hurricane's landfall in August 2011, which was below the $1 billion threshold that caused FEMA to act under [...] "immediate-needs status," [...] delaying long-term projects in favor of urgent tasks. [...] The proposed cuts targeted a program to fund development of fuel-efficient automobiles as well as the program that had guaranteed a loan to the recently bankrupt Solyndra corporation. [...] The Senate rejection of the House bill on September 23, 2011 raised the possibility of a government shutdown on October 1.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Blanchard, the county’s Inspector General, and MaryNic Foster, Executive Director of the Cook County Board of Ethics, the County’s top two {{government}} watchpersons, {{issued a}} joint advisory memo to County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, all 17 Cook County commissioners, and nine other elected county officials, including Berrios, warning them that hiring relatives violated county ethics laws. The Cook County Board of Ethics initiated {{an investigation of}} Berrios. The federal-court appointed attorneys monitoring City of Chicago and Cook County compliance with the Shakman decrees, designed to prevent politics from influencing most personnel decisions, raised objections {{to as many as}} 27 hirings and firings in the first month of the Berrios administration of the Assessor's office. On January 28, 2011, to comply with County Board President Preckwinkle’s request for <b>across-the-board</b> 16 percent budget cuts to help close an estimated $487 million budget shortfall, Berrios laid off 53 employees, of which 48 were members of unions, but Berrios' relatives remained on the payroll.

500|$|The two {{politicians}} had a storied history {{stemming from}} alternative perspectives and objectives. Dole was a longstanding conservative deficit hawk who had even voted against John F. Kennedy's tax cuts, while Kemp was an outspoken supply-sider. In the early 1980s, according to David Stockman, Kemp persuaded Reagan {{to make a}} 30% <b>across-the-board</b> tax cut a central 1980 presidential campaign feature. Once Reagan was elected, Dole was the Senate Finance Committee chairman who Kemp claims resisted the plan {{every step of the}} way. Dole concedes he expressed reservations about the 1981 plan. [...] The big confrontation came after the tax plan was approved and after Dole subsequently proposed tax increases that he referred to as reforms. [...] Kemp was vocal in his opposition to the reforms and even penned an op-ed piece in The New York Times, which enraged Dole. Reagan supported the reforms at Dole's request, causing Kemp to summon allies to meetings to stop the act, which eventually passed in 1982. At the 1984 Republican National Convention, Kemp, along with allies such as Gingrich and Lott, added a plank to the party platform that put President Reagan on record as ruling out tax increases. Gingrich called this action [...] "Dole proofing" [...] the platform, and the plank passed over Dole's opposition. Then, in 1985, Dole proposed an austere budget that barely passed in the senate with appendectomy patient Pete Wilson casting the tying vote and Vice President Bush casting the deciding vote. In meetings with the president that excluded Dole, Kemp reworked the budget to exclude crucial Social Security cutbacks. This {{is said to have been}} Dole's most crushing political defeat and to have contributed to the Republican loss of control of the Senate. During the 1988 presidential election, the two antagonized each other. [...] After Bush won and Kemp left Congress for the Cabinet, the two did not really cross paths again until 1996, when Kemp endorsed Dole's opponent Forbes on the eve of the New York Primary in March.|$|E
500|$|Established acts {{benefited from}} the new {{commercial}} climate, with Whitesnake's self-titled album (1987) selling over 17 million copies, outperforming anything in Coverdale's or Deep Purple's catalogue before or since. It featured the rock anthem [...] "Here I Go Again '87" [...] as one of 4 UK top 20 singles. The follow-up Slip of the Tongue (1989) went platinum, but according to critics Steve Erlwine and Greg Prato, [...] "it was a considerable disappointment after the <b>across-the-board</b> success of Whitesnake". Aerosmith's comeback album Permanent Vacation (1987) would begin a decade long revival of their popularity. Crazy Nights (1987) by Kiss was the band's highest charting release in the US since 1979 and the highest of their career in the UK. Mötley Crüe with Girls, Girls, Girls (1987) continued their commercial success and Def Leppard with Hysteria (1987) hit their commercial peak, the latter producing seven hit singles (a record for a hard rock act). Guns N' Roses released the best-selling début of all time, Appetite for Destruction (1987). With a [...] "grittier" [...] and [...] "rawer" [...] sound than most glam metal, it produced three top 10 hits, including the number one [...] "Sweet Child O' Mine". Some of the glam rock bands that formed in the mid-1980s, such as White Lion and Cinderella experienced their biggest success during this period with their respective albums Pride (1987) and Long Cold Winter (1988) both going multi-platinum and launching a series of hit singles. In {{the last years of}} the decade, the most notable successes were New Jersey (1988) by Bon Jovi, OU812 (1988) by Van Halen, Open Up and Say... Ahh! (1988) by Poison, Pump (1989) by Aerosmith, and Mötley Crüe's most commercially successful album Dr. Feelgood (1989). New Jersey spawned five Top 10 singles, a record for a hard rock act. In 1988 from 25 June to 5 November, the number one spot on the Billboard 200 album chart was held by a hard rock album for 18 out of 20 consecutive weeks; the albums were OU812, Hysteria, Appetite for Destruction, and New Jersey. A final wave of glam rock bands arrived in the late 1980s, and experienced success with multi-platinum albums and hit singles from 1989 until the early 1990s, among them Extreme, Warrant Slaughter and FireHouse. Skid Row also released their eponymous début (1989), reaching number six on the Billboard 200, but they were {{to be one of the}} last major bands that emerged in the glam rock era.|$|E
