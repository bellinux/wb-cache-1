25|$|The {{incident}} of her running between the Al-Safa and Al-Marwah hills is remembered by Muslims when they perform their pilgrimage (Hajj) at Mecca. Part of the pilgrimage {{is to run}} seven times between the hills, in commemoration of Hājar's courage and faith in God as she searched for water in the desert (which {{is believed to have}} then miraculously appeared from the Zamzam Well), and to symbolize the celebration of motherhood in Islam as well as the leadership of women. To complete the task, some Muslims also drink from the Zamzam Well <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> of the water back home from pilgrimage in memory of Hājar.|$|E
25|$|The {{underwater}} {{environment is}} unfamiliar and hazardous, {{and to ensure}} diver safety, simple, yet necessary procedures must be followed. A certain minimum level of attention to detail and acceptance of responsibility for one's own safety and survival are required. Most of the procedures are simple and straightforward, and become second nature to the experienced diver, but must be learned, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> practice to become automatic and faultless, just like the ability to walk or talk. Most of the safety procedures are intended {{to reduce the risk}} of drowning, and many of the rest are {{to reduce the risk of}} barotrauma and decompression sickness. In some applications getting lost is a serious hazard, and specific procedures to minimise the risk are followed.|$|E

On {{the two-year}} anniversary of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, he called for funds to be withdrawn and federal aid be cut off for the recovery effort. He remarked that it was time, [...] "the taxpayer gravy train left the New Orleans station." [...] The move was perhaps a step for the candidate to woo fiscal conservatives and advocates for states' rights, commenting that [...] "at some point, {{state and local officials}} and individuals have got {{to step up to the}} plate <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> initiative, the mentality that people can wait around indefinitely for the federal taxpayer to solve all their worldly problems has got to come to an end." ...|$|E

Soon after he was told by manager Gary Brabin to provide more support for the team's strikers, with Challinor agreeing, saying [...] "It will put the added responsibility on me to start shooting <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> pressure off the forwards. If the midfield can get some goals as well, then {{that will help the}} team". He immediately followed this up with the winning goal against Weymouth in a 1–0 home win on 11 October 2008, coming from a low right-footed shot into the corner from 25yards.|$|E

2500|$|Amid {{the sudden}} {{cancellation}} of her UPN sitcom Moesha, Norwood suffered {{a nervous breakdown}} in November 1999 — the result of her then-hectic and unhealthy lifestyle and a failed relationship {{in which she had}} experienced verbal abuse. Frightened by the idea that a yet-to-be-made third album she {{would not be able to}} live up to the success of her previous albums, Norwood went on a lengthy hiatus to reflect <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> introspective looks. [...] "I needed to rejuvenate, get my creative juices flowing, balance my life with some privacy, to find my confidence, find my love of music again," [...] she told Jet magazine in 2002. In mid-2000, she started refocused herself on her musical career, contributing songs to albums such as Urban Renewal (2001) and the Osmosis Jones soundtrack (2001), which introduced a scratchy, evocative edge to Norwood's voice, now having a deeper and warmer tone with a textured lower register and notably stronger falsetto.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God told Moses and Aaron to {{instruct}} the Israelites regarding the ritual {{law of the}} Red Cow ( [...] , parah adumah) used to create the water of [...] The cow was to be without blemish, have no defect, and not have borne a yoke. Eleazar the priest was to take it outside the camp, observe its slaughter, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> of its blood with his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the Tabernacle. The cow was to be burned in its entirety along with cedar wood, hyssop, and crimson stuff. The priest {{and the one who}} burned the cow were both to wash their garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. The ashes of the cow were to be used to create the water of lustration. One who touched the corpse of any human being was to be unclean for seven days. On the third and seventh days, the person who had touched the corpse was to cleanse with the water of lustration and then be clean. One who failed to do so would remain unclean, would defile the Tabernacle, and would be cut off from Israel. When a person died in a tent, whoever entered the tent was to be unclean seven days, and every open vessel in the tent was to be unclean. In the open, anyone who touched a corpse, bone, or a grave was to be unclean seven days.|$|E

2500|$|The batting captain {{is allowed}} seven minutes of rolling before his innings and Freddie Brown {{asked for the}} heavy roller to press down the wicket <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> of the demons out of it. In those days the Woolloongabba still used an old heavy roller drawn by a horse called Dobbin. As {{it had to be}} unhitched and led round after each pull of the roller over the pitch, most of the seven minutes was wasted and Brown didn't get much of the rolling he asked for. This was of great {{importance}} as if he had insisted on seven minutes actual rolling instead of messing about at either end the wicket would have been much less dangerous and England would have had less time to bat out before stumps. Though as Bill O'Reilly pointed out the time limits were devised when horse-drawn rollers were the norm and mechanical rollers were unheard of. Initially it made no difference as Reg Simpson was bowled first ball by a full toss from Ray Lindwall (2/21). The veteran England scorer Bill Ferguson was using his famous Ferguson Charts to record the details of each innings; how many runs a batsman had scored, how many balls, how many minutes, how many boundaries, etc. when Simpson was out one wag called out [...] "How long Bill, and how many fours?" [...] which produced a roar of laughter from the press box that astonished the crowd. Cyril Washbrook (6) and John Dewes (9) were determined to see out the day with dead bats and the wicket showed no signs of danger, but Sam Loxton took a superb catch {{to get rid of the}} Lancastrian off Lindwall. Jack Iverson was called up to bowl his first Test over 27 minutes before stumps and had Trevor Bailey in all kinds of trouble as his poked and prodded and could have been out five or six times in the mystery spinner's maiden over. Dewes was bowled by Keith Miller and with one over from Iverson remaining, Alec Bedser came out and immediately appealed against the bad light, but was turned down as he had yet to face a ball. He holed out to Neil Harvey off Iverson, Bailey gave a simple catch to Bill Johnston and Godfrey Evans ran out his fellow wicket-keeper Arthur McIntyre when he called for an unnecessary third run. Brown had fed in nightwatchman after nightwatchman in order to save Hutton, Compton and himself for the next day, but the Man from Pudsey still had to come out at 30/6 to survive the last two balls of an extraordinary day. When asked for his opinion that night Hutton said they might win [...] "if the others will stay till lunch and it doesn't rain again". It didn't rain again, but needing 163 to win with only four wickets in hand there was no room for mistakes. In the morning Brown, the umpires and a stopwatch ensured that England got their full 10 minutes rolling at the start of the day, which took nearly half an hour to complete. Evans (5) helped Hutton add 16 runs before he was caught by Loxton off Bill Johnston (2/30). Denis Compton came to the crease, but lasted one ball as he departed like Evans [...] "c Loxton, b Johnston". Brown came in at number 10 and held on grimly as Hutton peeled off 3 boundaries, though in the end the captain made 17 of their 29 runs together before he became Loxton's fourth victim when he was caught off Iverson (4/43). Doug Wright was the last man in at 77/9 and his batting tended to be a hit and miss affair which rarely reached double figures. Hutton (62 not out) farmed the bowling ruthlessly, making 43 of the 45 runs added for the last wicket. Wright managed to hold a straight bat up to the few balls he was left to face until the last four balls from Iverson before lunch. He kept out the first three, but spooned the last to Ray Lindwall at square leg and the match was over. The 12,000 strong crowd gave Hutton an heroic ovation and after lunch he replied to the congratulations showered on him with by admitting that [...] "with a bit of luck I'd have won the game".|$|E
