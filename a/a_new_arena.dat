5|$|Rockets owner Leslie Alexander {{first began}} to request <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>arena</b> in 1995, and {{attempted}} to release the Rockets from their lease at The Summit, which ran until 2003. However, he was denied by arena owner Chuck Watson, then-owner of the Aeros, who also wanted control of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>arena.</b> The two sides agreed to equal control over an arena in a deal signed in 1997, but the proposal was rejected by city voters in a 1999 referendum.

5|$|In May 1995, several Texas sports teams, {{including}} the Houston Rockets, proposed {{legislation that would}} dedicate state tax revenue to build new arenas. Although the bill was failed in the Texas House of Representatives, Rockets owner Leslie Alexander announced {{he would continue to}} study the possibility of constructing <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>arena</b> in downtown Houston, saying the 20-year-old Summit arena was too outdated to be profitable. Although the Summit's management said they could renovate the building for {{a small part of the}} cost of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>arena,</b> the Rockets began talks with the city of Houston on a possible location for an arena, They also negotiated with Houston Aeros and Summit owner, Chuck Watson, to release them from their contract with the Summit, which ran until 2003.|$|E

5|$|The ARS had the Blue Line end at Addison Road. However, {{sports fans}} {{continually}} {{argued for a}} three-mile (5km) extension to the Capital Centre sports arena in Largo, Maryland. On February 27, 1997, the WMATA board approved construction of the extension. By the time the extension opened in 2004, professional basketball and hockey had relocated to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>arena</b> atop the Gallery Place Station and the Capital Centre was replaced with a shopping mall. However, the extension still drew considerable sport spectator traffic because it is {{within walking distance of}} the FedExField football stadium. The extension cost $456 million.|$|E

5|$|The Seaman brothers, Daryl and Byron, {{had made}} an offer of $14 million while the City of Calgary {{prepared}} to build <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>arena</b> for the team. However, Canadian businessman Nelson Skalbania emerged as a rival bidder for the team before joining the Calgary consortium. The group agreed to purchase the Flames for $16 million, {{at the time the}} highest price ever paid for a National Hockey League franchise. The sale was announced on May 21, 1980, and the franchise relocated to Canada where it became the Calgary Flames. The Flames have since used the Atlanta logo for both its alternate captains, and the team's former affiliate that played in the American Hockey League, the Adirondack Flames.|$|E
5|$|With {{the timber}} wolf being a species not native to Louisiana, {{there was much}} {{speculation}} {{as to what the}} relocated franchise would be called. Although never officially changed, some of the proposed names included: Rhythm from New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial and Angels from Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards. After speculation as to where the team would play their home games while <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>arena</b> was constructed, Superdome officials notified the league that enough dates would be available to schedule 41 home games at the dome for the 1994–95 season. Prior to this announcement, the team was rumored to play games at the Lakefront Arena, the Pete Maravich Assembly Center in Baton Rouge or the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in Biloxi when the Superdome was unavailable.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the attempt to relocate the Timberwolves, the New Orleans Regional Basketball Alliance sought to lure an existing franchise to the city. After completion of the New Orleans Arena, the Alliance led efforts to relocate the Vancouver Grizzlies to the city. The New Orleans bid ultimately lost out to Memphis, and by early 2002 the city looked to the Charlotte Hornets to potentially relocate to the city. The Hornets became attractive to relocate following a failed referendum for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>arena</b> in Charlotte. On May 10, 2002, the NBA {{voted in favor of}} the relocation of the Hornets to New Orleans marking the return of the NBA to the city since the relocation of the New Orleans Jazz to Salt Lake City in 1979. In November 2002, the Timberwolves made their first trip to New Orleans since the failed relocation efforts of the Top Rank group in 1994.|$|E

5|$|The Oklahoma City Thunder is an American {{professional}} basketball franchise based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It {{plays in the}} Northwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). It {{was known as the}} Seattle SuperSonics from 1967 to 2008. The team plays its home games at the Chesapeake Energy Arena. As of October 2008, the Thunder is currently owned by Professional Basketball Club LLC and coached by Billy Donovan, with Sam Presti as its general manager. The team was formed in 1967. After spending 41seasons in Seattle, Washington, the SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City. Owner Clay Bennett, who purchased the team in 2006, sought to get public funding for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>arena</b> in Seattle, or a major renovation of the KeyArena in 2007. After failing to do so, he decided to move the team to Oklahoma City. Seattle sued Bennett's group to enforce the lease that required the team to stay until 2010. The two sides reached a $45million settlement to pay off the team's lease with KeyArena in July 2008.|$|E
5|$|The sport's {{changing}} economics led the Canadiens {{to build}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>arena</b> in 1996 to increase revenue. The final {{game at the}} Forum was held March 11, 1996, a 4–1 victory over the Dallas Stars. Following the game, an elaborate ceremony was held {{with many of the}} franchise's greatest members welcomed onto the rink. The most boisterous response was reserved for Maurice Richard, who received a ten-minute standing ovation. Finally, Emile Bouchard, the oldest living former captain, came onto the ice bearing a lit torch, and it was passed in a symbolic trail through the Canadiens' history: Bouchard passed it to Richard, who passed it to Jean Beliveau, and so on in chronological order to each former captain present, ending with Pierre Turgeon. In 72 years at the Forum, the Canadiens won over 1,500 games and captured 22 Stanley Cups.|$|E
5|$|While Conn Smythe {{was able}} to {{successfully}} build <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>arena,</b> numerous other teams experienced financial difficulties. With the folding of the Philadelphia Quakers (originally the Pittsburgh Pirates) and the St. Louis Eagles (originally the Ottawa Senators), the NHL was reduced to eight teams starting in the 1935–36 season. The Montreal Canadiens narrowly escaped a move to Cleveland, Ohio, before a syndicate of Montreal businessmen bought the team. Montreal's financial troubles forced them to sell popular player Howie Morenz. When Morenz scored against the Canadiens {{on the last day}} of the 1935 season, Montreal fans voiced their opinion, giving him a standing ovation. Morenz was eventually re-acquired by Montreal, and on January 28, 1937, Morenz's skate became caught in the ice during a play. He suffered a broken leg in four places, and died on March 8 of a coronary embolism; 50,000 people filed past Morenz's casket at centre ice of the Montreal Forum to pay their last respects. A benefit game held in November 1937 raised $20,000 for Morenz's family as the NHL All-Stars defeated the Montreal Canadiens 6–5.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} the late 1970s, the Bruins were looking for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>arena.</b> The Boston Garden was {{approaching}} 50 {{years old at the}} time and new owners, The Jacobs family, were looking to build a 17,000 seat arena in suburban Boston after negotiations fell through with the City of Boston.
