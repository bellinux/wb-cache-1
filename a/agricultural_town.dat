5|$|Warburton was {{predominantly}} a farming village {{during the}} medieval period. The north western {{corner of the}} township {{was used as a}} deer park.

25|$|The modern town of Letterkenny {{began as}} a market town {{at the start of}} the 17th century, during the Plantation of Ulster. It may have been {{established}} on the site of an earlier Gaelic settlement. It was the first crossing point of the River Swilly. In the recent past, Letterkenny was a largely <b>agricultural</b> <b>town,</b> surrounded by extensive cattle and sheep grazing on what was then untilled hillside – at a time when Conwal (3km west of Letterkenny) was the ecclesiastical and seaport centre. The waters of the Atlantic had not yet retreated from the basin of the Swilly, whose estuary at that time extended up almost as far as New Mills – proof of this may be found in those alluvial flat-lands between Oldtown and Port Road.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of the Ottoman rule, Latins lost their privileged status in Famagusta and were {{expelled}} from the city. Greek Cypriots were at first allowed to own and buy property in the city, but were banished from the walled city in 1573-74 and had to settle outside in the area that later developed into Varosha. Turkish families from Anatolia were resettled in the walled city but could not fill the buildings that previously hosted a population of 10,000. This caused a drastic decrease in the population of Famagusta. Merchants from Famagusta, who mostly consisted of Latins that had been expelled, resettled in Larnaca and as Larnaca flourished, Famagusta lost its importance as a trade centre. Over time, Varosha developed into a prosperous <b>agricultural</b> <b>town</b> thanks to its location away from the marshes, whilst the walled city remained dilapidated.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} colleges in California were founded {{at the height}} of the Gold Rush in 1851, both in the small <b>agricultural</b> <b>town</b> of Santa Clara. Less than a year after California was granted statehood, Santa Clara College, forerunner of Santa Clara University, was the first to open its doors to {{students}} and thus is considered the state’s oldest operating institution of higher education. Shortly after Santa Clara began instruction, the Methodist-run California Wesleyan College received a charter from the State Superior Court on July 10, 1851—the first granted in California—and it began enrolling students in May of the following year. Santa Clara’s Jesuit founders lacked the $20,000 endowment required for a charter, which was eventually accumulated and a charter granted on April 28, 1855. Santa Clara bears the distinction of awarding California’s first bachelor's degree, bestowed upon Thomas I. Bergin in 1857, as well as its first graduate degree granted two years later.|$|E

50|$|During the 19th {{century the}} history of Puerto Vallarta, then called El Carrizal or Las Peñas, was linked to {{the history of}} the Sierra towns of San Sebastian del Oeste, Talpa de Allende and Mascota.

Mascota and its neighboring towns located in the high plateaus of the Sierra, developed as <b>agricultural</b> <b>towns</b> to support the growing mining operations in the Sierra.|$|R
2500|$|When Suvorovo graves {{appeared}} in the Danube delta grasslands, horse-head maces also {{appeared in}} some of the indigenous farming towns of the Tripolye and Gumelnitsa cultures in present-day Romania and Moldova, near the Suvorovo graves. These agricultural cultures had not previously used polished-stone maces, and horse bones were rare or absent in their settlement sites. Probably their horse-head maces came from the Suvorovo immigrants. The Suvorovo people in turn acquired many copper ornaments from the Tripolye and Gumelnitsa towns. After this episode of contact and trade, but still during the period 4200-4000 BCE, about 600 <b>agricultural</b> <b>towns</b> in the Balkans and the lower Danube valley, some of which had been occupied for 2000 years, were abandoned. Copper mining ceased in the Balkan copper mines, and the cultural traditions associated with the <b>agricultural</b> <b>towns</b> were terminated in the Balkans and the lower Danube valley. This collapse of [...] "Old Europe" [...] has been attributed to the immigration of mounted Indo-European warriors. The collapse could have been caused by intensified warfare, for which there is some evidence; and warfare could have been worsened by mounted raiding; and the horse-head maces have been interpreted as indicating the introduction of domesticated horses and riding just before the collapse.|$|R
25|$|Mussolini {{launched}} several public construction {{programs and}} government initiatives throughout Italy to combat economic setbacks or unemployment levels. His earliest (and {{one of the}} best known) was the Battle for Wheat, by which 5,000 new farms were established and five new agricultural towns (among them Littoria and Sabaudia) on land reclaimed by draining the Pontine Marshes. In Sardinia, a model <b>agricultural</b> <b>town</b> was founded and named Mussolinia, but has long since been renamed Arborea. This town was the first of what Mussolini hoped would have been thousands of new agricultural settlements across the country. The Battle for Wheat diverted valuable resources to wheat production away from other more economically viable crops. Landowners grew wheat on unsuitable soil using all the advances of modern science, and although the wheat harvest increased, prices rose, consumption fell and high tariffs were imposed. The tariffs promoted widespread inefficiencies and the government subsidies given to farmers pushed the country further into debt.|$|E
25|$|The {{settlement}} that {{was established in}} the 1860s was originally named for the mill, but the name was changed to Los Gatos after the Spanish land grant. The town was incorporated in 1887 and remained an important town for the logging industry in the Santa Cruz Mountains {{through the end of the}} 19th century. In the early 20th century, the town became a thriving <b>agricultural</b> <b>town</b> with apricots, grapes and prunes being grown in the area. By the 1920s, the Los Gatos area had a local reputation as an arts colony, attracting painters, musicians, writers, actors and their bohemian associates as residents over the years. The violinist Yehudi Menuhin lived there as a boy; the actresses Joan Fontaine and Olivia de Havilland (sisters) were graduates of Los Gatos High School, John Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath there (the location is now located in Monte Sereno), and Beat hero Neal Cassady lived there in the 1950s. Along with much of the Santa Clara Valley, Los Gatos became a suburban community for San Jose beginning in the 1950s, and the town was mostly built-out by the 1980s.|$|E
