500|$|In 1993, Cassidy had a {{malignant}} mole removed from her back {{but did not}} follow up with regular check-up appointments. Three years later, during a promotional event for the Live at Blues Alley album in July 1996, Cassidy noticed an <b>ache</b> <b>in</b> her hips, which she attributed to stiffness from painting murals while perched atop a stepladder. The pain persisted and X-rays revealed a fracture. Further tests found that cancer had spread to her bones, causing the fracture, {{as well as to}} her lungs. Her doctors estimated she had three to five months to live. Cassidy opted for aggressive treatment, but her health deteriorated rapidly. On September 17, at a benefit concert for her at the Bayou, she made her final public appearance, closing the set with [...] "What a Wonderful World" [...] {{in front of an audience}} of family, friends, and fans. [...] Additional chemotherapy was ineffective and Cassidy died on November 2, 1996 at her family's home in Bowie, Maryland. In accordance with her wishes, her body was cremated and the ashes were scattered on the lake shores of St. Mary's River Watershed Park, a nature reserve near Callaway, Maryland.|$|E
500|$|Cooper starred with Robert De Niro and Jennifer Lawrence in David O. Russell's romantic comedy-drama Silver Linings Playbook, an {{adaptation}} of Matthew Quick's serio-comic novel of the same name. He was cast as a divorced man with bipolar disorder, a former teacher who finds companionship in a young, depressed widow (Lawrence). Cooper was initially skeptical about playing the part which he thought {{was out of his}} depth, but he later accepted the role inspired by Russell's confidence in him. The director was impressed by his performance in Wedding Crashers, citing his [...] "good bad-guy energy" [...] and unpredictability as justification for casting; he also thought that Cooper would be able to demonstrate emotion and vulnerability on screen. To prepare, Cooper took dance training with the choreographer Mandy Moore, who describes Cooper as having [...] "some real natural dancing ability." [...] The film was a box-office success, earning $236.4 million on a production budget of $21 million. Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers said that Cooper [...] "seizes the juiciest role of his career and meets every comic and dramatic challenge. There's an <b>ache</b> <b>in</b> his funny, touching and vital performance that resonates." [...] For his performance, he earned an MTV Movie Award for Best Performance, and nominations for an Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor.|$|E

30|$|Three of {{the item}} {{revisions}} in the PBC- 40 during wave 1 were to adapt from British English {{in the original}} version to terms more common in North America (i.e., “holiday” vs “vacation”). During wave 2, additional revisions were made to 3 items to further clarify their meaning. For example, 1 item asked about <b>aching</b> <b>in</b> the long bones of the patient’s arms and legs. Some participants had trouble responding because they experienced <b>aching</b> <b>in</b> the arms, {{but not in the}} legs or vice versa. Therefore, the stem was changed to “arms or legs” to make it clearer that participants could respond if they had <b>aching</b> <b>in</b> only one location.|$|R
500|$|Hayley Louise Brown of Clash {{viewed the}} song as an {{important}} part of the album, musing [...] "opening with a reworked version of heartbreaking ballad ‘Thinking About You’ and an instant confrontation with the full force of Ocean’s vocal range, the whole record echoes with extra terrestrial Odd Future synths and clumsy piano chords." [...] Lane Billings of Paste noted the song as whispy in nature, and made a case for Ocean as an R revivalist. Consequence of Sound's Harley Brown of stated that the song moves languidly, [...] "like perfect thoughts about someone missed, until the muscle memory of Ocean’s falsetto bursts into the song’s upper register." [...] She continued, [...] "while Ocean might feel this more acutely than either woman who sung those songs, there’s a reason Bey shed a tear the first time she heard it. Regardless of how much these lyrics were influenced by lines like, 'By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless,' the <b>ache</b> <b>in</b> Ocean’s voice is universal. MSN Music's Danielle Cheesman felt that Ocean did his followers a service by featuring the song as the album's opener, describing the track as" [...] the year-old spacey serenade to a boy that became a fan favorite." [...] She continued, [...] "despite now being enhanced with a strings intro, his falsetto - more importantly - remains in tact over the well-known warped ebb and flow." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 30, Richard {{went to see}} a {{chiropractor}} who rotated his neck to fix the flow of blood in his upper torso region. Later that day, Richard was participating in warm-ups before the game when he suffered a major stroke and collapsed in the outfield. Before the stroke, he had a headache and a feeling of weakness through his body. Eventually, that progressed into vision problems and paralysis in {{the left side of his}} body. A massive blockage in his right carotid artery necessitated emergency surgery that evening. An examination by neurologist William S. Fields showed that Richard was still experiencing weakness in his extremities and on the left side of his face. He also had blurred vision through his left eye. A CAT scan of Richard's brain later showed that Richard had experienced three separate strokes from the different obstructions in his arterial system. Furthermore, the arteries in his right arm were still obstructed. Later examinations showed that Richard was suffering from extensive arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. While pitching, his clavicle and first rib pinched his subclavian artery. As a result of this problem, Richard would feel normal for the first few innings of the game but after putting repeated pressure on his subclavian artery, his arm would start to <b>ache</b> <b>in</b> pain and eventually start to feel [...] "heavy". His wife at the time, Carolyn, told reporters, [...] "It took death, or nearly death, to get an apology. They should have believed him." ...|$|E
500|$|Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani {{gave the}} song {{a rating of}} B- and wrote: [...] "Like any good {{throwaway}} track, 'Beautiful Stranger' doesn't pretend {{to be much more}} than it is. Whiny guitars and flutes abound, Madonna and Orbit concocted a perfect theme song for friend Mike Myers's cooky Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Playful, wispy and ultimately forgettable". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly, declared it as the [...] "song of the summer", and praised it for being [...] "a piece of psychedelic pop at once so 60s and so 90s that to sully it with a 'shagalicious' joke would be an insult... The way [...] has of making her voice merge into indistinguishability with the surging instrumentation in the chorus, the way she sings the title phrase with an <b>ache</b> <b>in</b> her voice, that's at once urgent and playful." [...] Matthew Jacobs from The Huffington Post ranked the song 22 on their list of [...] "The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles". Louis Virtel, from TheBacklot.com, placed [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] at number 36 of his list [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs"; he felt that [...] "Orbit's psychedelic styling suit Madonna's groovy wistfulness perfectly". Author Phil Dellio wrote in his book Interrupting My Train of Thought that although [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] had similarities to Madonna's own [...] "Ray of Light" [...] (1998), it had [...] "better melody, better vocal, better light show. It's about the trippiest, most propulsive above-ground dance music since the first two minutes of Led Zeppelin's 'How Many More Times'." [...] J.

2500|$|After the {{expulsion}} of the Jesuits in 1768, there is no further information about the Aché {{until the end of}} the 19th century and early 20th century, when several writers related the knowledge of local Paraguayan populations concerning the Aché, but none observed them directly. [...] These included reports by several foreign scientists as well as the renowned Paraguayan naturalist Moises Bertoni (whose information about the Aché was published posthumously). Finally, a German immigrant, Federico Maynthusen contacted a group of <b>Aché</b> <b>in</b> 1908, in the modern department of Itapua, and published information on both their language and culture.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, {{after decades}} of persecution, the Ypety Aché were {{contacted}} in modern-day Caazapa and pacified by Manuel de Jesus Pereira.

[...] Both groups together numbered only about 100 individuals when contacted. [...] Between 1963 and 1968 {{more than half of}} the Aché that had been recently pacified perished from disease while under Pereira's supervision.

2500|$|The {{cause of}} Kenshin's death has been {{questioned}} throughout the years. The theory accepted by most scholars is that early sources record his deterioration of health condition, his complaints of pain in the chest [...] "like an iron ball", and as Kenshin Gunki (1582) records [...] "on the 9th day of the 3rd month he had a stomach <b>ache</b> <b>in</b> his toilet. This unfortunately persisted until the 13th day when he died". However, it is also speculated that he was victim {{of one of the}} most famous ninja assassinations; a ninja been waiting in the cesspool beneath the latrine at Kenshin's camp with a short spear or sword. The theories are not mutually exclusive [...] the assassin, if he existed, and was possibly sent by Nobunaga, might simply have fatally wounded an already-dying man. However, as his anticipation of own death is recorded in the death poem, the possibility of the assassination is less likely.|$|E

2500|$|On the album's jazz elements, {{music critic}} Vince Aletti wrote, [...] "the songs have a loose, unanchored quality that sets {{them apart from}} both R and rock work. Scott-Heron sings straight-out, with an <b>ache</b> <b>in</b> his voice that conveys pain, {{bitterness}} and tenderness with equal grace and, in most cases, subtlety. Frequently {{the nature of the}} jazz backing is so free that the vocals take on an independent, almost a cappella feeling which Scott-Heron carries off surprisingly well." [...] Uncut writes that [...] "Heron adopts his trademark jazz-funk sound, underpinned by the great Ron Carter on bass, with Hubert Laws' flute fluttering about like an elusive bird of paradise". Sputnikmusic's Nick Butler notes its latter eight songs as [...] "in line with the soul of the very early '70s - think a Curtis that replaces an orchestra with a chamber band, or a What's Going On that replaces head-in-the-clouds wistfulness with earthy indignation, or a There's A Riot Goin' On without the drugs".|$|E
2500|$|The Stooge films {{made between}} 1935 and 1941 {{captured}} {{the team at}} their peak, according to film historians Ted Okuda and Edward Watz, authors of The Columbia Comedy Shorts. Nearly every film produced became a classic in its own right. Hoi Polloi (1935) adapted the premise of Pygmalion, with a stuffy professor making a bet that he can transform the uncultured trio into refined gentlemen; the plotline worked so well that it was reused twice, as Half-Wits Holiday (1947) and Pies and Guys (1958). Three Little Beers (1935) featured the Stooges running amok {{on a golf course}} to win prize money. Disorder in the Court (1936) features the team as star witnesses in a murder trial. Violent is the Word for Curly (1938) was a quality Chase-directed short that featured the musical interlude [...] "Swingin' the Alphabet". In A Plumbing We Will Go (1940)—one of the team's quintessential comedies—the Stooges are cast as plumbers who nearly destroy a socialite's mansion, causing water to exit every appliance in the home. Other entries of the era are considered among the team's finest work, including Uncivil Warriors (1935), A Pain in the Pullman (1936), False Alarms (also 1936), Grips, Grunts and Groans (1937), The Sitter Downers (also 1937), Dizzy Doctors (also 1937), Tassels in the Air (1938), We Want Our Mummy (1939), Nutty but Nice (1940), An <b>Ache</b> <b>in</b> Every Stake (1941) and In the Sweet Pie and Pie (also 1941).|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that an {{abnormal}} salt-soluble form of G 1 acetylcholinesterase (<b>AChE)</b> is increased <b>in</b> the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine changes <b>in</b> <b>AChE</b> activity <b>in</b> an in vivo model of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) administration. Rats received intracerebroventricular injections of Aβ 25 - 35 (20 μg/day for seven days). Levels of <b>AChE</b> were measured <b>in</b> cerebral cortex and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after two months. Aβ 25 - 35 administration did not alter total <b>AChE</b> activity <b>in</b> the cerebral cortex or CSF. However, analysis of salt-extractable AChE isoforms revealed an increase in the proportion of G 1 in both cortex and CSF, similar to that previously observed in AD patients. The results support the view that changes <b>in</b> <b>AChE</b> isoform pattern <b>in</b> the AD brain are a direct consequence of Aβ accumulation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.
