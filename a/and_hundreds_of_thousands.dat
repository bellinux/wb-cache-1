Following the violence, dozens of Uzbek community and religious leaders were arrested by the Kyrgyzstani government and accused of inciting ethnic violence, among them Azimzhan Askarov, who had been filming killings and arson attacks during the riots. Askarov then distributed the video to international media and accused the Kyrgyz military of complicity in the killings.|$|E

5|$|Super Typhoon Angela, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Rubing, was an intense {{tropical}} cyclone that formed in late September 1989. The storm developed from a tropical disturbance in the monsoon trough and moved generally westward throughout its duration. The storm ultimately peaked in intensity as a super typhoon and struck northern Luzon in the Philippines. After weakening and traversing the South China Sea, Angela bypassed Hainan {{to the south and}} struck Vietnam before dissipating. The storm caused severe damage and 119 fatalities in the Philippines. Thousands of houses were damaged, <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of residents were impacted by the typhoon. Monetary damage is placed at $8 million.|$|E

5|$|The Great Raid of 1840 was {{the largest}} Indian raid on white cities {{in the history of}} what is now the United States—though {{technically}} when it occurred it was in the Republic of Texas and not in the United States.

They took over 3,000 horses and mules, <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of dollars of other plunder, ranging from silver to cloth and mirrors. Unfortunately for the war party, the sheer volume of loot slowed them down, and made them vulnerable to attack from a militia that otherwise would never have caught them. Equally, the militia missed an opportunity to destroy the bulk of the raiding party when they concentrated on recovering and dividing the recovered bullion and other plunder.|$|E

The Brier was just getting underway and games in the afternoon draw were delayed to allow curlers and fans to watch the funeral, which was broadcast on screens at the rink.

5|$|As {{most of the}} livable land in West Virginia is in {{the flood}} plain, the high river {{flooding}} caused heavy damage, wrecking many small rural towns and washing out miles of roadways. A total of 43bridges were destroyed and another 80 were damaged. Near Moorefield, the bridge carrying U.S. Route 220 was closed, but was reopened after emergency repairs. In Paw Paw, a flooded river washed a swept up building into a bridge, washing it away. Much of Pendleton County became isolated after 18bridges were washed out and roads were covered by mudslides. The Cheat River destroyed 110 of the 132houses in Albright, and washed away a trailer park in Rowlesburg. The flooding downed thousands of trees, which were carried into houses and recreation areas to cause additional damage. Agriculture losses were heavy after the floods washed away the topsoil and left behind miles of debris. Many farm structures were washed away, <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of chicken or turkeys were killed. Statewide, at least 8,968houses were damaged, and another 4,000 were destroyed, which left nearly 2,600people homeless. In addition, the floods damaged or destroyed 711businesses. Agriculture damage was estimated at $97million, and damage to the United States Forest Service in the state was estimated at $3.9million. Statewide damage totaled nearly $700million, and 38people were killed in West Virginia. This made it the most damaging flood in the state's history, according to then-Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{developments}} in memorials to the war, the cenotaph, used an empty tomb to symbolise these aspects of the war. In 1919, Britain and France planned victory marches through their respective capitals {{and as part of}} this France decided to erect a temporary cenotaph, an empty sarcophagus monument, which would be saluted by the marching troops. The British Prime Minister David Lloyd George decided that a similar but non-denominational memorial should be built in London, despite ministerial concerns that a cenotaph was an inappropriate, Catholic form of monument, and that it might be desecrated. The victory marches went ahead; French political leaders had the memorial in Paris removed immediately after the parade, on the basis that it was too Germanic in appearance, but the London cenotaph proved very popular <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> flocked to see it. The popularity of the temporary Cenotaph resulted in it remaining open until the following year, when the decision had to be taken {{about what to do with}} the decaying structure: there was concern from the government that a permanent memorial might be vandalised, while the popular press criticised any suggestion of dismantling the existing structure. A new, permanent cenotaph designed by Edwin Lutyens was commissioned and unveiled on Whitehall Street on Armistice Day 1920, effectively turning this part of London into a memorial to the war; over a million people visited the site during November that year. The memorial style became very popular and spread to other countries in the subsequent years.|$|E
