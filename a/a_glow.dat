5|$|Both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder {{mentioned}} that damp wood sometimes gives off <b>a</b> <b>glow</b> and many centuries later Robert Boyle showed that oxygen {{was involved in}} the process, both in wood and in glow-worms. It was not until the late nineteenth century that bioluminescence was properly investigated. The phenomenon is widely distributed among animal groups, especially in marine environments where dinoflagellates cause phosphorescence in the surface layers of water. On land it occurs in fungi, bacteria and some groups of invertebrates, including insects.|$|E

5|$|Overall {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to past entries in the series. The player, as Alex, explores the various environments and locales, searching for clues to advance the plot, such as photographs, drawings and other items which are placed inside Alex's journal, which the player may read at any time. To assist the player, Alex will turn his head towards items and clues to inform the player that the object may be picked up; other recurring items include weapons and ammunition, which give off <b>a</b> <b>glow</b> as a visual cue to the player, and health drinks. Puzzle elements also {{play a part in}} the game, and Alex's journal may be used to refer to photographs and other items that can help the player decipher such puzzles as keypad entries. For {{the first time in the}} series, the player may select responses when engaging in dialogue with other characters encountered in the game, which in turn may affect how the player sees the plot unfold.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to staying below the arcing voltage, the ignition system keep the voltage across the points below the breakdown voltage for an air gap to prevent <b>a</b> <b>glow</b> discharge across the points. Such <b>a</b> <b>glow</b> discharge would quickly transition to an arc, and the arc {{would prevent the}} spark plug from firing. The minimum voltage for <b>a</b> <b>glow</b> discharge in air is about 320V. Consequently, the capacitor value is chosen to also keep the voltage across the points {{to be less than}} 320V. Keeping the points from arcing when they separate is the reason the ignition coil includes a secondary winding rather than using just a simple inductor. If the transformer has a 100:1 ratio, then the secondary voltage can reach 30kV.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1960s, four-pin thermal {{starters}} and manual switches were used.

25|$|Once {{the tube}} strikes, the {{impinging}} main discharge keeps the cathodes hot, permitting continued electron emission {{without the need}} for the filaments to continue to be heated. The starter switch does not close again because the voltage across the lit tube is insufficient to start <b>a</b> <b>glow</b> discharge in the starter.|$|E

25|$|When {{power is}} first {{applied to the}} circuit, there will be <b>a</b> <b>glow</b> {{discharge}} across the electrodes in the starter lamp. This heats the gas in the starter and causes one of the bi-metallic contacts to bend towards the other. When the contacts touch, the two filaments of the fluorescent lamp and the ballast will effectively be switched in series to the supply voltage. The current through the filaments causes them to heat up and emit electrons into the tube gas by thermionic emission. In the starter, the touching contacts short out the voltage sustaining the glow discharge, extinguishing it so the gas cools down and no longer heats the bi-metallic switch, which opens within a second or two. The current through the filaments and the inductive ballast is abruptly interrupted, leaving the full line voltage applied between the filaments {{at the ends of}} the tube and generating an inductive kick which provides the high voltage needed to start the lamp. The lamp will fail to strike if the filaments are not hot enough, in which case the cycle repeats; several cycles are usually needed, which causes flickering and clicking during starting (older thermal starters behaved better in this respect). A power factor correction (PFC) capacitor draws leading current from the mains to compensate for the lagging current drawn by the lamp circuit.|$|E

500|$|Helium has a valence of {{zero and}} is {{chemically}} unreactive under all normal conditions. It is an electrical insulator unless ionized. As {{with the other}} noble gases, helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential. Helium can form unstable compounds, known as excimers, with tungsten, iodine, fluorine, sulfur, and phosphorus when it is subjected to <b>a</b> <b>glow</b> discharge, to electron bombardment, or reduced to plasma by other means. The molecular compounds HeNe, HgHe10, and WHe2, and the molecular ions , , , and [...] have been created this way. HeH+ is also stable in its ground state, but is extremely reactive—it is the strongest Brønsted acid known, and therefore can exist only in isolation, as it will protonate any molecule or counteranion it contacts. This technique has also produced the neutral molecule He2, which has {{a large number of}} band systems, and HgHe, which is apparently held together only by polarization forces.|$|E
500|$|The German {{physicist}} Johann Wilhelm Hittorf studied {{electrical conductivity}} in [...] gases: in 1869, he discovered <b>a</b> <b>glow</b> emitted from the cathode that increased in size with decrease in gas pressure. In 1876, the German physicist Eugen Goldstein {{showed that the}} rays from this glow cast a shadow, and he dubbed the rays cathode rays. During the 1870s, the English chemist and physicist Sir William Crookes developed the first cathode ray tube {{to have a high}} vacuum inside. He then showed that the luminescence rays appearing within the tube carried energy and moved from the cathode to the anode. Furthermore, by applying a magnetic field, he was able to deflect the rays, thereby demonstrating that the beam behaved as though it were negatively charged. In 1879, he proposed that these properties could be explained by what he termed 'radiant matter'. He suggested that this was a fourth state of matter, consisting of negatively charged molecules that were being projected with high velocity from the cathode.|$|E

While Wilson has no special {{abilities}} beyond growth of [...] "a magnificent beard", which slows the speed of freezing in winter, and accelerates overheating in summer, other playable characters do; a few examples follow. Willow, a firestarter, is immune to fire damage and will start a small fire on the ground, which can set fire to nearby objects, when she has a low sanity level. A girl named Wendy receives visits from her deceased twin sister Abigail when summoned. A strongman named Wolfgang has higher health, offensive capabilities that grow the more his hunger meter is full, but starves faster and loses more sanity when near danger. WX78 is an android who nonetheless needs to eat, sleep, and stay mentally stimulated, but does not become ill from spoiled food, can increase its maximum health, hunger, and sanity with gears (which are reset to the original maximum after dying and respawning, but the corpse leaves behind {{a portion of the}} used ones), and takes damage from rain. WX-78 also attracts lightning, being made of conductible material, that makes it surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>glow,</b> which gradually decreases with time as the charge wears off, refills health, and lowers sanity while continuing to speed the loss of it.|$|E
