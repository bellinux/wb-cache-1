5000|$|The powder made by {{grinding}} up such caramel-coated nuts is called pralin, {{and is an}} ingredient in many cakes, pastries, and ice creams. After this powder has been mixed with chocolate, it becomes praliné in French, which gave birth to what is known in French as chocolat praliné. The word praliné is used colloquially in France and Switzerland to refer to these, known simply as [...] "chocolates" [...] in English, i.e. various centres coated with chocolate. [...] In mainland Europe, the word praline {{is often used to}} mean either this nut powder or the chocolate paste made from it, widely used to <b>fill</b> <b>chocolates,</b> hence its use (by synecdoche) in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom to refer to <b>filled</b> <b>chocolates</b> in general. In the United Kingdom, the term can refer either to praline (the <b>filling</b> for <b>chocolates)</b> or, less commonly, to the original whole-nut pralines.|$|R

40|$|In {{the most}} cases fat bloom is a {{consequence}} of fat migration ("center bloom"). Therefore it is important to study all the influences on migration and to control this specific problem of <b>filled</b> <b>chocolates.</b> These processes were studied at <b>filled</b> <b>chocolate</b> hollow balls. These chocolates mean a very useful model system, flexible in the choice of <b>chocolate</b> composition, <b>filling</b> composition and storage conditions. In general, migration is influenced by a lot of parameters, which are connected with the solid fat content (storage temperature, compatibility, oil content, origin of cocoa butter and milk fat) and with the fat structure (polymorphic structure of cocoa butter, oil absorption within fat structure). The fat phase as well as the non-fat part of chocolates and fillings has some effect...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of fat bloom {{is the dominant}} cause of quality loss of chocolate. Although not hazardous, the optical change caused by fat bloom leads to customer rejection and hinders the sale and export of chocolate products. It is therefore of major concern for chocolate manufacturers to improve shelf-life of solid and, even more severe, <b>filled</b> <b>chocolates...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fat {{migration}} {{is the main}} reason for the loss of quality of stored chocolate products. It includes the unpleasant softening of <b>filled</b> <b>chocolates</b> and the hardening of their fillings.
