2500|$|Through data mining, {{companies}} {{are able to}} improve their sales and profitability. With this data, companies create customer profiles that contain customer demographics and online behavior. A recent strategy has been the purchase and production of [...] "network analysis software". This software is able to sort out through the influx of social networking data for any specific company. Facebook has been especially important to marketing strategists. Facebook's controversial [...] "Social Ads" [...] program gives companies access {{to the millions of}} profiles in order to tailor their ads to a Facebook user's own interests and hobbies. However, rather than sell <b>actual</b> <b>user</b> information, Facebook sells tracked [...] "social actions". That is, they track the websites a user uses outside of Facebook through a program called Facebook Beacon.|$|E

30|$|Based on the {{correlation}} analysis, generally {{an increase in}} population accessible is associated {{with an increase in}} service area coverage. Nevertheless, population accessibility and service area coverage do not directly imply more number of <b>actual</b> <b>users.</b> Other parameters such as the number of private and public car users and the type of land use are possibly the reasons behind the <b>actual</b> number of <b>users.</b>|$|R
50|$|The term weatherfax {{was coined}} after the {{technology}} that allows the transmission and reception of weather charts (surface analysis, forecasts, and others) from a transmission site (usually the meteorological office) to a remote site (where the <b>actual</b> <b>users</b> are).|$|R

50|$|Designer {{interaction}} with <b>actual</b> <b>users</b> on such large-scale projects would often {{be viewed as}} expensive and inefficient for some designers, but an alternative view suggests that some designers and some companies do not value {{interaction with}} <b>actual</b> <b>users.</b> Some experts have suggested that designers and developers may even have contempt for <b>actual</b> <b>users.</b> In large-scale projects {{there is often a}} practical necessity for the division of labor, but that should not be used to justify lack of user involvement at each step of the software development life cycle. The person responsible for designing a product may be far removed from the development of a product, and even further removed from traditional user experience studies, which analyze how users interact with a product versus how it was designed to be used. The degrees of separation inherent in these large-scale projects can create a disconnect between ambitious designers who risk creating ineffective products that they prefer to design, instead of designing what users want and need. Care must be taken to involve the user at each step of the design cycle, lest the needs of the user be ignored and a sub-standard product design result.|$|R
30|$|Stations {{with large}} overlap of service areas have reduced number of <b>actual</b> <b>users</b> {{due to the}} fact that the accessible {{population}} are divided between the shared stations. Therefore, unnecessary large service area overlap is a wastage that does not contribute to more number of users.|$|R

50|$|Unlike code-based {{solutions}} that use programming languages (e.g. Selenium or PhantomJS), Screenster {{operates as a}} scriptless/codeless tool. Instead of simulating user actions with scripts, Screenster offers record-playback test automation functionality, which means the platform records <b>actual</b> <b>user</b> interactions with the GUI. The recorded actions are then automatically re-run during the regression testing phase.|$|E
50|$|DéjàClick is an add-on for the Mozilla Firefox {{web browser}} that {{provides}} the ability to record and play select web transactions to monitor and/or analyze. This functionality is similar to website monitoring, with the exception that it monitors website transactions from inside the browser to simulate the <b>actual</b> <b>user</b> experience. The add-on was developed by AlertSite.|$|E
50|$|After {{you enter}} a group name, short name, and group ID, click the Save button {{to create the}} group or save your changes. You can then add users to the group by {{clicking}} the plus sign button next to the Members listbox, which displays a drawer containing the available users and groups on the computer. Make sure that the tab {{at the top of}} drawer is set to display users instead of groups (the tab with the single person icon) and double-click on each user that you want to add to the group. This drawer contains every system-level user account as well as <b>actual</b> <b>users</b> (to avoid potential problems, only work with <b>actual</b> <b>users).</b> To remove users, select the users in the Members listbox and then click the minus sign button. When you’re finished, click the Save button.|$|R

50|$|Che divides {{its users}} in three groups. The {{developers}} are the <b>actual</b> <b>users</b> of the IDE. This {{can either be}} by accessing a remote Che server or by having a local instance of Che running. Product owners may use Che to provide on-demand workspaces. Plug-In Providers can develop either client side IDE or server side workspace manager plug-ins.|$|R
50|$|Yet {{another method}} {{is to make the}} main program an {{interpreter}} for a programming language, either designed specifically for the application in question or general-purpose, and then write the bulk of the <b>actual</b> <b>user</b> functionality as macros or other forms of add-ins in this language, an approach taken for example by the GNU Emacs text editor.|$|E
5000|$|Usability testing - {{testing of}} the prototypes on an <b>actual</b> <b>user</b> - often using a {{technique}} called think aloud protocol where you ask the user {{to talk about their}} thoughts during the experience. User interface design testing allows the designer to understand the reception of the design from the viewer's standpoint, and thus facilitates creating successful applications.|$|E
