6000|$|The [...] "Biographic Universelle" [...] {{informs us}} that [...] "An ancient {{manuscript}} chart drawn in 1529 by Diego Ribeiro, a Spanish cosmographer, has preserved {{the memory of}} the voyage of Gomez [a Portuguese sent out by Charles the Fifth]. One reads in it under (<b>au</b> <b>dessous)</b> the place occupied by the States of New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, Terre d'Etienne Gomez, qu'il découvrit en 1525 (Land of Etienne Gomez, which he discovered in 1525)." [...] This chart, with a memoir, was published at Weimar in the last century.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{extraordinary}} that a thinker who could so clearly discern {{the secret of}} the great spiritual movements of human history, should fail to perceive that the same law governs and explains all the minor movements in which wide communities have been suddenly agitated by the word of a teacher. It is well--as no one {{would be more likely to}} contend than myself, who have attempted the task--to demonstrate the contradictions, the superficiality, the inadequateness, of the teaching of Rousseau, Voltaire, or Diderot. But it is well also, and in a historical student it is not only well, but the very pith and marrow of criticism, to search for that 'adaptation,' to use M. Taine's very proper expression, which gave to the word of these teachers its mighty power and far-spreading acceptance. Is it not as true of Rousseau and Voltaire, acting in a small society, as it is of Buddha or Mahomet acting on vast groups of races, that 'leur point de vue était le seul auquel les multitudes échelonnées <b>au</b> <b>dessous</b> d'eux pouvaient se mettre?' Did not they too seize, 'by a happy stroke of circumstance,' exactly those traits in the social union, in the resources of human nature, in its deep-seated aspirations, which their generation was in a condition to comprehend,--liberty, equality, fraternity, progress, justice, tolerance? ...|$|E

5000|$|The gazette {{played an}} {{important}} role in the [...] "Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns", a debate on whether the arts and literature of the 17th century had achieved more than the illustrious writers and artists of antiquity, which would last until the beginning of the eighteenth century. Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle and the Mercure galant joined the [...] "Moderns". Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux was pushed into the role of champion of the [...] "Anciens", and Jean Racine, Jean de La Fontaine and Jean de La Bruyère (who is famous for a jibe against the gazette: [...] "le Mercure... est immédiatement <b>au</b> <b>dessous</b> de rien" [...] Mercure...) took his defense.|$|E
5000|$|His unpopularity was, however, chiefly {{confined}} to the subjects of his sarcastic portraiture, and to the hack writers of the time, of whom he was wont to speak with a disdain only surpassed by that of Alexander Pope. His description of the Mercure galant as [...] "immédiatement <b>au</b> <b>dessous</b> de rien" [...] (immediately below nothing) is the best-remembered specimen of these unwise attacks; and would of itself account for the enmity of the editors, Fontenelle and the younger Corneille. La Bruyère's discourse of admission at the Academy, {{one of the best}} of its kind, was, like his admission itself, severely criticized, especially by the partisans of the [...] "Moderns" [...] in the [...] "Ancient and Modern" [...] quarrel. With the Caractères, the translation of Theophrastus, and a few letters, most of them addressed to the prince de Condé, it completes the list of his literary work, {{with the exception of a}} curious and much-disputed posthumous treatise.|$|E
