40|$|Boron {{neutron capture}} therapy (BNCT) {{is a form}} of {{radiation}} therapy mediated by the short-range (less than 10 fim) energetic alpha (4 He) and lithium- 7 (7 Li) ionizing particles that result from the prompt disintegration by slow neutrons of the stable-(nonradioactive) nucleus boron- 10 (10 B). Recent advances in radiobiological and toxicological evaluation of tumour-affirutive boron-containing drugs and in optimization of the energies of neutrons in the incident beam have spurred interest in BNCT. This article presents a history of BNCT that emphasizes studies in the USA. A new dosimetric analysis of the 1959 — 1961 clinical trials of BNCT at Brookhaven National Laboratory is also presented. This analysis yields an <b>acute</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> tolerance limit estimate of — 10 Gy-Eq to the capillary endothelium of human basal ganglia from BNCT.

50|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} is generally harmful and potentially lethal to living things but can have health benefits in radiation therapy {{for the treatment}} of cancer and thyrotoxicosis. Its most common impact is the induction of cancer with a latent period of years or decades after exposure.

50|$|High <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> {{gives rise}} to {{deterministic}} effects which reliably occur above a threshold, and their severity increases with dose. Deterministic effects are not necessarily more or less serious than stochastic effects; either can ultimately lead to a temporary nuisance or a fatality.

50|$|Cancer is a {{stochastic}} effect of radiation, {{meaning that the}} probability of occurrence increases with effective <b>radiation</b> <b>dose,</b> but {{the severity of the}} cancer is independent of dose. The speed at which cancer advances, the prognosis, the degree of pain, and every other feature of the disease are not functions of the <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> to which the person is exposed. This contrasts with the deterministic effects of <b>acute</b> <b>radiation</b> syndrome which increase in severity with dose above a threshold. Cancer starts with a single cell whose operation is disrupted. Normal cell operation is controlled by the chemical structure of DNA molecules, also called chromosomes.|$|R

50|$|The {{solar cycle}} is an {{approximately}} 11-year period of varying solar activity including solar maximum where {{the solar wind}} is strongest and solar minimum where the solar wind is weakest. Galactic cosmic rays create a continuous <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> throughout the Solar System that increases during solar minimum and decreases during solar maximum (solar activity).

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was retrieved from all animals in control and radiation treated groups up to 72 h post radiation. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was analyzed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), acid phosphatase (AP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), cell count and total protein. Intragroup and intergroup comparison of BALF parameters at different <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> showed significant difference. LDH was significantly increased as the dose increased from 1 Gy to 5 Gy (P = 0. 00) after 2 h with effect size of difference (r > 0. 3). ALP was significantly altered after 3 Gy and 4 Gy (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Optimisation of {{radiation}} protection in fluoroscopy is important since the procedure {{could lead to}} relatively high absorbed doses both in patients and personnel resulting in <b>acute</b> <b>radiation</b> injury. Optimisation procedures include adjustment of the fluoroscopy equipment such as exposure factors as well as proper use of automatic brightness control and pulsed fluoroscopy.

Proper positioning of the patient with respect to detector and X-ray tube is of fundamental importance to image quality and <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> to the patient. Both image quality and <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> are also affected by the methodology used with parameters such as magnification factor, increased filtration, use of last-image-hold and the use of a grid.

40|$|Introduction The {{number of}} {{computed}} tomography (CT) examinations has increased rapidly since CT became commercially available. This resulted in growing concerns regarding {{the risk of}} malignancies induced by application of medical ionizing <b>radiation.</b> Therefore, <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> reduction strategies are needed and being developed. This {{is especially important for}} patients who get many CT scans (e. g. chest CT for follow up of lung nodules), CT scans with high <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> (e. g. scans of the heart) and for children who are more sensitive to <b>radiation.</b> A recent <b>dose</b> reduction strategy focuses on optimization of image reconstruction. With current reconstruction methods, <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> reduction results in noisy images, which are susceptible to artefacts. Iterative reconstruction (IR) is an alternative image reconstruction method that allows for image quality improvement at similar <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> or imaging at lower <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> without compromising image quality compared to current methods. Improved computational power of CT reconstruction workstations has permitted the recent introduction of IR for CT. Purpose The aim of this thesis was to evaluate both potential applications of IR: improving image quality and reducing <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> of CT scans of the heart and the lungs. First, in-vitro and ex-vivo preclinical research was performed to globally assess the potentials of IR for both applications. Second, image acquisition of cardiopulmonary CT examinations was optimized in-vivo with IR. Finally, IR was applied to reduce the <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> in the clinical setting and explore novel indications for CT. Results With the current thesis, we showed that IR can be used to improve image quality in routine dose CT, to reduce the <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> without loss of image quality, or with a combination of both strategies. We conclude that <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> for CCTA, calcium scoring CT, contrast-enhanced chest CT and plain chest CT can be reduced substantially by using IR. For calcium scoring CT scans of the heart, we first performed a phantom study, then an ex-vivo study and finally a pilot study in 30 individuals evaluating the maximally achievable <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> reduction.
