5|$|The artwork {{became one}} of the most imitated album covers in music. The image of a band in front of <b>a</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> dressed in ripped jeans and leather jackets was copied by Alvin and the Chipmunks in Chipmunk Punk. Ramoness artwork was ranked number 58 on Rolling Stones 1991 list of 100 Greatest Album Covers.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} shaky footage showing a figure mostly {{concealed}} {{in the shadow}} between two window-sized openings in <b>a</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall,</b> through which leaves in trees can be seen blowing in the wind. These images are accompanied by indistinct electronic buzzing and hissing sounds. The figure holds their right hand to the window, signaling with three fingers, then one, and finally two.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{significant}} reclamation {{on the two}} sites very little evidence remains of the power stations, other than {{a small number of}} bricks and steel rods. Some minor structures have survived to the North West of the North station's site, including a road bridge over the rail line which served the station, <b>a</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall,</b> and a concrete staircase. More obvious remains of the power stations are their three large sub-stations that still supply the local region. Much of this electrical power is generated in Scotland's Cockenzie power station, transported via a 275 kilovolt (kV) and a 400 kV connection.|$|E
5|$|The album cover, {{photographed by}} Punk magazine's Roberta Bayley, {{features}} the four members leaning against <b>a</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> in New York City. The record company paid only $125 {{for the front}} photo, which has since {{become one of the}} most imitated album covers of all time. The back cover depicts an eagle belt buckle along with the album's liner notes. After its release, Ramones was promoted with two singles which failed to chart. The Ramones also began touring to help sell records; these tour dates were mostly based in the United States, though two were booked in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Bow Street was first {{developed}} by Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford in 1633. Buildings were first erected {{on the west}} side of the street that year, and it was fully built by around 1635-6. Development to the northeast was restricted by <b>a</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> that had been built by the Earl's cousin, Edward Russell, 3rd Earl of Bedford, in 1610 as a land boundary and remained undeveloped for some time. It was eventually built on around 1673-7, with eleven properties constructed.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} Sutcliffe's {{aneurysm}} is unknown, {{although it is}} believed to have been started by an earlier head injury, as he was either kicked in the head, or thrown, head first, against <b>a</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> during a fight outside Lathom Hall, after a performance in January 1961. According to former manager Allan Williams, Lennon and Best went to Sutcliffe's aid, fighting off his attackers before dragging him to safety. Sutcliffe sustained a fractured skull in the fight and Lennon's little finger was broken. Sutcliffe refused medical attention at the time and failed to keep an X-ray appointment at Sefton General Hospital.|$|E
5|$|The {{temple and}} pyramid were also {{surrounded}} by <b>a</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall.</b> Likely {{for reasons of}} economy, the causeway leading to the mortuary temple {{at the foot of}} the pyramid was never built, no satellite pyramid was added to the mortuary complex, and the valley temple was left unfinished. Consequently, the priest of the mortuary cult of Neferirkare lived on the temple premises, in dwellings of mud-bricks and rushes, rather than in the pyramid town closer to the Nile valley.|$|E
5|$|Developed by Probe Entertainment, the Game Boy port is {{superior}} to the Game Boy version of the original game but only contains eight of the 12 playable fighters from the arcade game (lacking Baraka, Johnny Cage, Kung Lao and Raiden); Kintaro and Noob Saibot were also removed from the game. Only three of ten arenas are retained from the arcade version: the Kombat Tomb, the Pit II and Goro's Lair. The Kombat Tomb contains the port's only Stage Fatality and Goro's Lair is much simpler in this version (consisting of <b>a</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> with no openings or glowing eyes). Blood is completely removed and each playable character retains only one of their Fatalities plus the Babality.|$|E

5|$|Built for the {{protection}} of a small stupa, the structure has two stone platforms decorated with elaborate stone carvings. The lower platform is entered through a single entrance facing the north, while the second platform can be accessed through four doorways facing the four cardinal points. The upper platform, surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall,</b> contains the stupa. Four Buddha statues are seated around it, each facing one of the entrances. Three concentric rows of stone columns had also been positioned here, presumably to support a wooden roof. The entire structure is decorated with stone carvings. Some of the carvings at the Polonnaruwa Vatadage, such as its sandakada pahanas, are considered to be the best examples of such architectural features. Although some archaeologists have suggested that it also had a wooden roof, this theory is disputed by others.|$|E
5|$|Entrance to the {{platforms}} {{is controlled}} by automatic ticket gates on Platform 3, which is used by many northbound CrossCountry trains and local services to Bristol Parkway and Gloucester. The main station restaurant and bar {{is on the left}} and the short Platform 1, a bay, is beyond this. This is most frequently used by Severn Beach Line trains but is long enough to handle any four-car Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU). Behind Platform 1 is <b>a</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> that forms part of the signal box and on this are some metal artworks created by artists with learning difficulties to celebrate Brunel's 200th anniversary in 2006; an interpretation panel is nearby. The High Level Siding beyond Platform 1 is the rump of the Bristol Harbour Railway, and Barton Hill traction maintenance depot {{can be seen in the}} distance alongside Bristol East Junction (formerly South Wales Junction) where the lines to Bristol Parkway and Bath diverge.|$|E
5|$|From then on, Isabella used Castle Rising {{as one of}} {{her main}} residences until her death in 1358. Isabella was a wealthy woman, as the King granted her a yearly income of £3,000, which by 1337 had {{increased}} to £4,000. She enjoyed a regal lifestyle in Norfolk, maintaining minstrels, huntsmen and grooms, and received visits from Edward and the royal household on at least four occasions. Despite her large income, Isabella ran up long-standing debts with the local merchants near the castle. Around the time that she took over the castle, a new set of buildings were constructed in the central bailey, including a west range containing a residential suite, a new private chapel, and a south range linking to various service buildings; the existing kitchen was reused. The great hall was reroofed, although Isabella lived in the west range, using the keep only for formal occasions or as accommodation for very senior guests. <b>A</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> around the outside of the inner bailey may have been built around this time to provide additional security.|$|E

A large opening in {{the eastern end of}} the nave frames the sanctuary beyond and <b>a</b> curved <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> with centrally suspended curtain creates the backdrop to the sanctuary and altar. Low level, angled <b>brick</b> <b>walls</b> create the altar rail and the elevated pulpit is located in the south-east corner of the chancel behind <b>a</b> curved face <b>brick</b> <b>wall.</b> Both walls are finished with a dressed timber capping. The sanctuary ceiling is lined with Cane-ite and painted light blue.|$|R
5|$|Much of the Cetacean Institute, Taylor's workplace, {{was created}} by using the real-life Monterey Bay Aquarium. A holding tank for the whales was added via special effects to the Aquarium's exterior. For close-ups of the {{characters}} as they watched the whales in the tank, the Aquarium's walls and railings were measured and replicated for a set on the Paramount parking lot. One scene takes place by a large glass through which observers view the whales—and Spock's initiation of a mind meld—underwater. Footage of the actors shot {{in front of them}} as they reacted to <b>a</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> in the Aquarium was combined with shots taken from their rear as they stood in front of a large blue screen at ILM to produce this scene. The footage of Spock's melding with the whales was shot weeks later in a large water tank used to train astronauts for weightlessness.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame is a {{collection}} of plaques, mounted on <b>a</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> in the Ashburn Alley section of Citizens Bank Park, the ballpark of the Philadelphia Phillies. From 1978 to 2003, the Phillies inducted one figure from their franchise history and one notable person from the Philadelphia Athletics (A's) organization each yearwith the exception of 1983, when the Phillies inducted their Centennial Team. Once Veterans Stadium closed in 2003, the wall plaques used to recognize the Phillies' members were moved to Citizens Bank Park; however, the Phillies no longer induct notable Athletics. Each person inducted into the Wall of Fame was honored with a metal plaque showing the person's face; their position with, and years of service to, the team; and a summary of their most important contributions. In March 2004, the Athletics' plaques were relocated to the Philadelphia Athletics Historical Society in Hatboro, Pennsylvania, and a single plaque listing all of the A's inductees was attached to a statue of Connie Mack located across the street from Citizens Bank Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} a simple country lane on {{the boundary of}} Hyde Park, separated by <b>a</b> <b>brick</b> <b>wall.</b> Aristocratic properties appeared during the late 18th century, including Breadalbene House, Somerset House and Londonderry House. The road grew in popularity during the 19th century after improvements to Hyde Park Corner and more affordable views of the park, which attracted the nouveau riche to the street and led to it {{becoming one of the}} most fashionable roads to live on in London. Notable residents included the 1st Duke of Westminster's residence at Grosvenor House, the Dukes of Somerset at Somerset House and the British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli at No.93. Other historic properties include Dorchester House, Brook House and Dudley House. In the 20th century, Park Lane became well known for its luxury hotels, particularly The Dorchester, completed in 1931, which became closely associated with eminent writers and international film stars. Flats and shops began appearing on the road, including penthouse flats. Several buildings suffered damage during World War II, yet the road still attracted significant development, including the Park Lane Hotel and the London Hilton on Park Lane, and several sports car garages. A number of properties on the road today are owned by some of the wealthiest businessmen from the Middle East and Asia. Current residents include business mogul Mohamed Al-Fayed and former council leader and Lord Mayor Dame Shirley Porter.|$|E
