40|$|Summary: Intensive {{interviews}} were conducted with 14 <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers,</b> which identified 16 challenges <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers</b> face when adopting children with special needs. The purpose was to specify and understand the issues these mothers of special needs children present when seeking professional therapy. The intent was also to increase awareness for professionals working in the field of adoption. • Findings: Findings indicated that these <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers</b> were faced with a broad range of issues relating to societal, health, emotional, family, financial, and child behavioral factors. The prevalence of these issues was not influenced by differing demographics, by ages of the children at the time of adoption, nor by the types of adoptions. • Applications: <b>Adoptive</b> <b>mothering</b> of special needs children is different from other mothering and needs to be recognized with its challenges. Post-adoption support services that adequately and financially meet the needs of these mothers and their families can help to build strong healthy adoptive families. In doing so, there is a strong potential for a {{decrease in the number of}} adoption disruptions and an increase in the level of adoption satisfaction.

Vertebrate mothers are generally the first individuals to encounter {{and interact with}} young animals. Thus, their role is primordial during ontogeny. The present study evaluated non-genomic effects of mothers {{on the development of}} rhythms of precocial Japanese quail (Coturnix c. japonica). First, we investigated the influence of mothering on the ontogeny of endogenous rhythms of young. We compared circadian and ultradian rhythms of feeding activity of quail reared with or without <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers.</b> More brooded than non-brooded quail presented a circadian and/or an ultradian rhythm. Thus, the presence of the mother during the normal brooding period favors, in the long term, expression of rhythms in the young. Second, we investigated the influence of rhythmic phenotype of the mother on the development of endogenous rhythms of young by comparing quail brooded by circadian-rhythmic <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers</b> (R) to quail brooded by circadian-arrhythmic <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers</b> (A). More R-brooded than A-brooded quail expressed circadian rhythmicity, and circadian rhythm clarities were greater in R-brooded than A-brooded quail. Ultradian rhythmicity did not differ between R- and A-brooded quail, nor between R and A <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers.</b> Thus, the rhythmic phenotypes of quail mothers influence the rhythmic phenotypes of their young.

Emerging adulthood is a developmental {{period in which}} family relationships are important, yet research provides evidence that adoptive families have lower relationship quality compared to their nonadoptive counterparts. Despite some support for a relationship between adoption and adoptee-adoptive mother relationships during emerging adulthood, no systematic investigation has occurred. Utilizing self-report and observational data from the Sibling Interaction and Behavior Study, two studies employed hierarchical regression analyses to extend knowledge {{of the relationship between}} adoption and adoptee-adoptive mother relationships during emerging adulthood. Study 1 investigated the association between adoptee-reported adoption-related variables and the self-reported and observed relationships adoptees have with their <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers</b> during emerging adulthood.

40|$|<b>Adoptive</b> <b>mothers</b> are important, yet often hidden {{members of}} the {{adoption}} circle. They are also a unique group of mothers. The research presented in this thesis involved the participation of fifty <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers.</b> Presented in their own terms are their experiences as they traverse a different road to mothering and as they experience the many similarities to, and many differences from other women engaged {{in the role of}} mother. Significant points across the adoption life cycle were examined. In order to gather rich and meaningful data on a range of <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers.</b> experiences and emotions, two semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with the participants. To extend and complement the qualitative data on the range of experiences and emotions experienced in adoptive motherhood, including the early post adoption mothering period, three objective measures were introduced. These were the Social Readjustment Scale (Holmes and Rahe Life Event Scale), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and the Interview Schedule for Social Interaction. What was envisaged was a presentation of adoption from the little researched perspective of adoptive mothers; a united voice presenting a different perspective on adoption and on mothering. However the wide ranging, unique, individual, complex and dynamic nature of the experiences of <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers</b> in Queensland presents both identifiable similarities, and an unexpectedly rich diversity of experience. The findings from this research, and the conclusions drawn, have important implications for social work practice in the area of adoption and for adoption policy, service delivery and future research. In particular, the contribution made to the theoretical social work knowledge base with reference to adoption practice is of importance. Additionally, the experiences of <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers</b> revealed in this study suggest that this research can also offer insight for informed social work practice with many mothers in this society...|$|R

40|$|Background: Fathers {{and mothers}} play an unique {{role in the}} {{relationship}} with their children. This also accounts for the relationships of adoptive parents and their adopted children. Research {{of the differences between}} adoptive fathers and <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers</b> in the relationship with their children is scarce. Aim: In this study the relationship of adoptive fathers with their daughters was investigated, by comparing this relationship with <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers</b> and their daughters. The difference between <b>adoptive</b> fathers and <b>mothers</b> in the interpretation of the problem behavior of their children was also examined. Methods: Adoptive fathers (n = 67) and matched <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers</b> (n = 67) completed a questionnaire about their adopted daughters, when their daughters were on average 7. 7 years (SD = 2. 7) old. The questionnaire included questions about the relationship between adoptive parents and their children, about the time they spend together, their communication {{and the extent to which}} adoptive parents trust their adopted children. The adoptive parents also completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess problem behavior of the adopted daughters. The Total Problem behavior scale and Social Problem scale were used in the current study. Results: Most adoptive parents were positive about their relationship with their adopted daughter. There was no significant difference between the relationship of adoptive fathers and their adopted daughters and <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers</b> and their adopted daughters. Communication, time spend together and trust were significantly related to the amount of problem behavior of the adopted child. The relationship between adoptive parents and their adopted daughters was significant related to their ratings of problem behavior: a better relationship meant more problem behavior. Conclusion: There were no significant differences in the relationship between <b>adoptive</b> fathers and <b>mothers</b> and their adopted daughters. Their perspective on the amount of problem behavior of their adopted daughters is also the same. It’s therefore important to value the role of adoptive fathers when training and counselling is offered to adoptive parents...|$|R
40|$|WOS: 000225168300004 International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether mothers' fear of human could influence the way young domestic Japanese quail respond to human. The first step was to obtain a set of <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers</b> habituated-to-human (H mothers) and a set of <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers</b> non-habituated-to-human (NH mothers). A set of 6 -month-old adult females was handling daily for 15 successive days whereas another set of 6 -month-old adult females received no visual or physical contact with human during the same period. We then obtained two sets of <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers</b> non-divergent in tonic immobility (TI) duration but divergent by the amount of "fear" behaviour expressed towards human (human observer test, cage-plus-experimenter test). Then, we compared a set of young raised by H mothers to a set of young raised by NH mothers. Observations and tests were carried out both during the brooding period (between 5 and 12 days of age) and after separation from mothers (between 13 and 90 days of age). Our results revealed that young raised by H mothers were less fearful towards a static human (cage-plus-experimenter test, hand-on-home-cage-door-test) as well as towards a moving human (human observer test and capture test) than young raised by NH mothers. Nevertheless, as was found between the two sets of <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers,</b> no clear differences were found between the two sets of young concerning general emotional reactivity (tonic immobility test, open field test and hole-in-the-wall test). These results reveal that young bird's emotional reactivity to human could be modulated by the mother and that this maternal influence remains detectable well after the end of maternal contact.

This study explores the experiences of nine <b>adoptive</b> <b>mothers</b> living in a small unitary authority in the UK.

Demonstrating the complexity and diversity of the women’s experience, three less common themes were also identified: ‘Fragility of Adoption’, ‘The Reward of Adoption’, ‘The Child Mediating the Experience’. The women’s experience conveys the overwhelming nature of adoptive motherhood, and supports the notion of adoptive motherhood as a multifaceted social phenomenon. A parallel between these findings and the motherhood literature is seen, with the feminist discourse of society emerging from the women’s interviews.
