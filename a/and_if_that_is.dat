In 1897, Tillman accused the Republicans, [...] "I certainly {{do not want to}} attack any member of the committee who does not deserve to be attacked [...] nobody denies that there have been rooms occupied for two months by the Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee at the Arlington Hotel... in easy reach of the sugar trust".

2500|$|An {{executor}} is {{the person}} appointed by a will {{to act on the}} behalf of the estate of the will maker (the [...] "testator") upon his or her death. An executor is the legal personal representative of a deceased person's estate. The appointment of an executor only becomes effective after the death of the testator. After the testator dies, the person named in the will as executor can decline or renounce the position, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the case should very quickly notify the probate court registry accordingly. There is no legal obligation for that person to accept the appointment.|$|E

The consensus (ijma) used must be that of the companions found in their reported sayings or actions. According one supporter, Serajul Haque, his rejection of the consensus of other scholars was justified, {{on the basis of the}} instructions given to the jurist Shuraih ibn al-Hârith from the Caliph Umar, one of the companions of Muhammad; to make decisions by first referring to the Qur'an, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not possible, then to the sayings of the Prophet and finally to refer to the agreement of the companions like himself.|$|E
2500|$|Hanson {{has argued}} that the U.S. may be forced to take a much more confrontational stance towards Iranian {{violation}} of prior nuclear enrichment prohibitions, advocating, if necessary, [...] unilateral responses to the country should it continue its aggressive acts of war. On the Hugh Hewitt show in August 2007, Hanson stated, [...] "We really need to start doing some things beyond talking, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> going into Iranian airspace, or buzzing Iranians, or even starting to forget where the border is and taking out some of these training camps, we need to do that and send a message, because they're a paper tiger.

[...] In a 2014 column Hanson faulted the Obama administration for engaging in [...] "appeasement" [...] of Iran and of fruitlessly attempting to negotiate an end to the Iranian program to acquire nuclear weapons, predicating if Iran continued enrichment unchecked that: [...] "Accordingly, it is more than likely that {{in the next two years}} Iran will become a nuclear power." ...|$|E

Education and scholarship was also a primary concern for Mormon women. Religious missions, like Bathsheba W. Smith's mission to southern Utah to preach [...] "woman's rights", were launched. The Woman's Exponent magazine, the unofficial publication of the Relief Society, published a 1920 editorial in favor of [...] "equal rights before the law, equal pay for equal work, [...] equal political rights", stating that a women's place is not just [...] "in the nursery" [...] but [...] "in the library, the laboratory, the observatory." [...] In 1875, Relief Society president Emmeline B. Wells said that women should speak for themselves, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> considered manly, that should be a good thing, since if men are superior, becoming more masculine ought to be desirable.: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Civic Party was {{initially}} lukewarm to the idea; it later responded with their [...] "3-Stage Fight Plan for Universal Suffrage", which involves firstly negotiation {{with the government}} for a firm roadmap and timetable, Five Constituencies Resignation, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not successful, mass resignation of all 23 democrats in Legco. Party co-founder Ronny Tong opposed the plan, fearing the loss of veto if their numbers dwindled in the by-election. Tong was not confident of the pan-democratic camp being able to mobilise sufficient voters to render meaningful effect in the so-called de facto referendum. He also feared that failing to get Beijing to agree to its demand after {{the first phase of}} protest would lead to mass pan-democratic resignations from LegCo, which would be likely to further the split the pan-democratic camp. [...] Around November 2009 there were disputes within the pan-democracy camp as to who would resign or not. Tong said he would not resign his seat in Legco if there was to be a mass resignation, but would instead leave the party he helped found.|$|E
