50|$|Passive {{respiratory}} gas humidifiers {{are independent}} from any external energy source or external water supply. They function as heat and moisture Exchangers (HME) and are placed like an <b>artificial</b> <b>nose</b> between a tube and Y piece. Here they withdraw heat and moisture from expirations, which they resupply to the inspired gas {{during the following}} inspiration. As there are significant functional differences among the various HMES on the market, respiratory therapists should test the efficacy of each individual model. The ideal HME has high reversible water retention capacity, small internal volume, and low flow resistance.|$|E
40|$|Technical {{issues in}} the care of {{mechanically}} ventilated patients include those related to the ventilator circuit, humidification and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Principal issues related to ventilator circuits include leaks and compression volume. Circuit compression volume affects delivered tidal volume as well as measurements of auto-positive end-expiratory pressure and mixed expired PCO 2. Resistance through the ventilator circuit contributes to patient-ventilator dyssynchrony during assisted modes of mechanical ventilation. Adequate humidification of inspired gas is necessary to prevent heat and moisture loss. Common methods of humidification of inspired gas during mechanical ventilation include use of active heated humidifiers and passive <b>artificial</b> <b>noses.</b> <b>Artificial</b> <b>noses</b> are less effective than active humidifiers and are best suited to short term use. With active humidifiers, the circuit can be heated to avoid condensate formation. However, care must be exercised when heated circuits are used to avoid delivery of a low relative humidity and subsequent drying of secretions in the artificial airway. Although pneumonia is a complication of mechanical ventilation, these pneumonias are usually the result of aspiration of pharyngeal secretions and are seldom related to the ventilator circuit. Ventilator circuits {{do not need to be}} changed more frequently than weekly for infection control purposes, and the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia may be greater with more frequent circuit changes...|$|R

5000|$|A {{thin plate}} of wax is fitted to the stump of the nose, {{so as to}} make a nose of good appearance; it is then {{flattened}} and laid on the forehead. A line is drawn around the wax, which is then of no further use, and the operator then dissects off as much skin flap as wax plate had covered, leaving undivided a small slip flap-pedicle between the eyes. This slip preserves the blood circulation till a union has taken place between the new and the old parts. The cicatrix of the stump of the nose is next pared off, and, immediately behind the new part, an incision is made through the skin, which passes around both alae, and goes along the upper lip. The skin, now brought down from the forehead, and being twisted half-around, is inserted into this incision, so that a nose is formed with a double hold above, and with its alae and septum below, fixed in the incision.A little Terra Japonica (pale-catechu) is softened with water, and after being spread on slips of cloth, five or six of these are placed over each other to secure the joining. No other dressing, but this cement, is used for four days. It is then removed, and cloths dipped in ghee are applied. The connecting slip of skin is divided at about the twentieth day, when a little more dissection is necessary to improve the appearance of the new nose. For five or six days after the operation, the patient is made to lie on his back, and on the tenth day, bits of soft cloth are put into the nostrils to keep them sufficiently open. This operation is always successful. The <b>artificial</b> <b>nose</b> is secured and looks nearly as well as the natural nose, nor is the scar on the forehead very observable after a length of time.

40|$|Although they {{represent}} a valuable alternative to heated			 humidifiers, artificial noses have unfavourable mechanical effects. Most			 important {{of these is the}} increase in dead space, with consequent increase in			 the ventilation requirement. Also, artificial noses increase the inspiratory			 and expiratory resistance of the apparatus, and may mildly increase intrinsic			 positive end-expiratory pressure. The significance of these effects depends on			 the design and function of the <b>artificial</b> <b>nose.</b> The pure humidifying function			 results in just a moderate increase in dead space and resistance of the			 apparatus, whereas the combination of a filtering function with the humidifying			 function may critically increase the volume and the resistance of the			 <b>artificial</b> <b>nose,</b> especially when a mechanical filter is used. The increase in			 the inspiratory load of ventilation that is imposed by artificial noses, which			 is particularly significant for the combined heat-moisture exchanger filters,			 should be compensated for by an increase either in ventilator output or in			 patient's work of breathing. Although both approaches can be tolerated by			 most patients, some exceptions should be considered. The increased pressure and			 volume that are required to compensate for the <b>artificial</b> <b>nose</b> application			 increase the risk of barotrauma and volutrauma in those patients who have the			 most severe alterations in respiratory mechanics. Moreover, those patients who			 have very limited respiratory reserve {{may not be able to}} compensate for the			 inspiratory work imposed by an <b>artificial</b> <b>nose.</b> When we choose an <b>artificial</b>			 <b>nose,</b> we should take into account the volume and resistance of the available			 devices.

40|$|Both {{olfactory}} {{systems of}} animals, or <b>artificial</b> <b>noses,</b> {{can increase the}} capacity of the system exponentially by combining many sensors with overlapping response profiles, thanks to the power of combinatorial coding. Studying animal systems helps to understand the underlying mechanism, and knowledge of odor-response profiles, in this pursuit, is of paramount importance. We present here a new approach towards this goal: DoOR, the database of odorant responses, including a freely available access to it on the Internet. THE COMBINATORIAL NATURE OF OLFACTORY CODING The chemical environment provides the most complex sensory cues all living organisms on earth have to deal with, being composed of an uncountable number of different molecules. Many kinds of chemosensory systems have evolved and all organisms use some of them, but the most elaborate one is olfaction. This sense is amazingly efficient and enables organisms to orient and communicate within this incredibly complex chemical world.

40|$|The neural {{dynamics}} of an insect’s olfactory brain was analyzed and interpreted {{in terms of}} computational models of information coding and memory formation. The studies reveal that the neural dynamics in antennal lobe, the primary neural network processing odor information in insects and analogue to the mammalian olfactory bulb, possesses odor-specific (fixed point) attractors. These results together with the anatomical connectivity between the antennal lobe and downstream networks suggest that the insect’s olfactory system performs as a fundamental artificial neural network, the perceptron, to recognize odors. Further analyses of the spontaneous neural activity revealed that a memory trace of the last smelt odor reverberates for several minutes after stimulation. This memory trace can be retrieved through a correlation analysis of the spontaneous activity, which demonstrates the Hebbian nature of this form of memory. These natural strategies to process and store information in a real olfactory system may inspire the design of reliable <b>artificial</b> <b>noses.</b> 1...|$|R
50|$|Before {{effective}} treatments were available, syphilis could {{sometimes be}} disfiguring {{in the long}} term, leading to defects of the face and nose ("nasal collapse"). Syphilis was a stigmatized disease due to its sexually transmissible nature. Such defects marked the person as a social pariah, and a symbol of sexual deviancy. <b>Artificial</b> <b>noses</b> were sometimes used to improve this appearance. The pioneering work of the facial surgeon Gasparo Tagliacozzi in the 16th century marked {{one of the earliest}} attempts to surgically reconstruct nose defects. Before the invention of the free flap, only local tissue adjacent to the defect could be harvested for use, as the blood supply was a vital determining factor in the survival of the flap. Tagliacozzi's technique was to harvest tissue from the arm without removing its pedicle from the blood supply on the arm. The patient would have to stay with their arm strapped to their face until new blood vessels grew at the recipient site, and the flap could finally be separated from the arm during a second procedure.|$|R

30|$|In recent years, a large {{effort has}} been spent on {{advancing}} the understanding of how surface-supported membranes are formed through vesicle fusion. The aim is to find simple model systems for investigating biophysical and biochemical interactions between constituents of cell membranes and, for example, drugs and toxins altering membrane function. Designing and controlling the self-assembly of model membranes onto sensor substrates thus constitutes an important field of research, enabling applications in, e.g., drug screening, dynamic biointerfaces, <b>artificial</b> <b>noses,</b> and research on membrane-active antibiotics. The authors have developed and investigated the formation of strongly negatively charged supported lipid membranes which systematically mimic bacterial membrane composition on three important biosensor materials: SiO 2, TiO 2, and indium tin oxide. By tuning the electrostatic interaction through balancing the lipid vesicle charge with the ionic strength of Ca 2 + as a fusion promoter, the authors have optimized the self-assembly and obtained {{new insights into the}} details of lipid vesicle-surface interaction. The results will be useful for future development and application of specialized lipid membrane surface coatings prepared from complex lipid compositions. The adsorption processes were characterized by a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, which allowed the determination of formation also of nonplanar supported lipid membranes.|$|R

The system, otherwise known as optoelectronic nose, harvests the unique infrared spectrum of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in conjunction to a fabricated multilayered photonic Bragg fibers that filters the incident spectrum of the infrared to a narrow transmission band. The sensing mechanism of the device comprises the measurement of infrared absorption of volatile analytes inside the hollow cores of opto uidic Bragg fibers. An array of six fibers is used, where each fiber target a different region of the midinfrared {{in the range of}} 2 - 14 m with transmission bandwidths of about 1 - 3 m. The quenching in the transmission of each fiber due to the presence of analyte molecules in the hollow core is measured separately and the cross response of the array allows the identification of virtually any (VOC). The device was used for the identification of seven industrial VOC vapors with high selectivity using a standard blackbody source and an infrared detector. The array response is registered as a unique six digit binary code for each analyte by assigning a threshold value to the fiber transmissions.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} a previously unreported property of deoxyribonucleic acid-the ability of dye-labeled, solid-state DNA dried onto a surface to detect odors {{delivered in the}} vapor phase by changes in fluorescence. This property is useful for engineering systems to detect volatiles and provides a way for artificial sensors to emulate the way cross-reactive olfactory receptors respond to and encode single odorous compounds and mixtures. Recent {{studies show that the}} vertebrate olfactory receptor repertoire arises from an unusually large gene family and that the receptor types that have been tested so far show variable breadths of response. In designing biomimetic <b>artificial</b> <b>noses,</b> the challenge has been to generate a similarly large sensor repertoire that can be manufactured with exact chemical precision and reproducibility and that has the requisite combinatorial complexity to detect odors in the real world. Here we describe an approach for generating and screening large, diverse libraries of defined sensors using single-stranded, fluorescent dye-labeled DNA that has been dried onto a substrate and pulsed with brief exposures to different odors. These new solid-state DNA-based sensors are sensitive and show differential, sequence-dependent responses. Furthermore, we show that large DNA-based sensor libraries can be rapidly screened for odor response diversity using standard high-throughput microarray methods. These observations describe new properties of DNA and provide a generalized approach for producing explicitly tailored sensor arrays that can be rationally chosen for the detection of target volatiles with different chemical structures that include biologically derived odors, toxic chemicals, and explosives...|$|R
