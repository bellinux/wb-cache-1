It appears that zinc pyrithione is highly soluble in many primary aliphatic amines. In other more complex amines, such as the poly-alkylenimines, a definite stable molecular complex is formed.

40|$|Synopsis [...] A highly active <b>anti{{dandruff}}</b> agent, seleniuxn sulfide, was {{studied with}} normal and dandruff scalps {{to test the}} hypothesis that the excess scaling is due to an overproduction of horny cells and that effective therapy is absolutely dependent on lowering the rate of multi-plication of germinative cells. A new technique to demonstrate an increased production of horny cells in dandruff entailed determination of the corneocyte count, the quantity of horny cells per square centimeter produced over a 4 -day period. Use of a selenium sulfide-contain-ing shampoo sharply reduced the corneocyte counts; a nomncdicated shaxnpoo reduced the count only slightly. Selenium sulfide was proportionately effective in lowering the corneocyte count of the normal scalp. It was postulated that this agent controls dandruff by its cytostatic capa-bilities. Its principal impact is to reduce cell turnover. Thyroidinc radioautography con-firmed the inhibitory effect of selenium sulfide on epidermopoesis. The labeling index of both the epidermis and the infundibulum of the hair follicles of the normal scalp, not previ-ously described in the literature, was determined.

40|$|Dandruff is {{a common}} scalp {{disorder}} affecting {{almost half of the}} postpubertal population of any ethnicity and both genders. It may, however, represent a stubborn esthetical disturbance often source of pruritus. Skin biocenosis, in particular the Malassezia spp. flora, plays a key aetiologic role, in combination with the unusual capacity of some corneocytes to be coated by these yeasts. Substantial evidence indicates that keratinocytes play {{an active role in the}} generation and expression of immunopathological reactions. This is probably the case in dandruff. Upon stimulation of a critical colonization of corneocytes by Malassezia yeasts, the release of pro-inflammatory mediators is increased. This could lead to the subclinical microinflammation present in dandruff. In seborrheic dermatitis, local deposits of immunoglobulins and the release of lymphokines are responsible for the recruitment and local activation of leukocytes leading to the eventual amplification of the inflammatory reaction. Some ancillary non-microbial causes of dandruff may operate through physical or chemical irritants. Many methods have been described for rating dandruff.

Material and methods: Type 2 diabetes was induced by a high fat diet and low dose streptozotocin (STZ). Diabetic adult male albino rats were allocated into groups and treated according to the following schedule; Pioglitazone HCL (PIO), EA, CHLOR and HEXA extracts of Urtica piluilifera at two doses of 250 and 500 mg/ kg were used. In addition, a normal control group and a diabetic control one were used for comparison. Blood glucose, insulin resistance, antioxidant enzymes, 8 -hydroxy- 2 -deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) as well as C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor-a levels were evaluated. Results: EA and CHLOR extracts of Urtica pilulifera exhibited a significant hypoglycemia associated with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in diabetic rats; however, HEXA extract showed no beneficial effect. These activities are responsible, at least partly, for improvements that have been seen in hyperglycemia and insulin resistance of diabetic rats.
