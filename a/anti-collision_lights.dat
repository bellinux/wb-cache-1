25|$|The P-X shares some {{components}} {{with the}} C-X, later {{designated as the}} Kawasaki C-2, another indigenously-developed aircraft to replace the Kawasaki C-1 and C-130H Hercules cargo aircraft. The P-X and C-X designs were originally independent, {{it was decided that}} having common components to both designs would be useful. The JDA mandated that the two aircraft share identical body components; common components include the cockpit windows, outer wings, horizontal stabilizer, and other systems. Internal shared parts include the auxiliary power unit, cockpit panel, flight control system computer, <b>anti-collision</b> <b>lights,</b> and gear control unit. Due to the different roles of the two aircraft, they remain distinctly separate. The sharing of development resources had allowed for a large reduction in overall development costs which, when including the C-2, were reported as being 345 billion Yen ($3 billion) in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Kawasaki {{developed}} the C-X {{in parallel with}} the P-X, which it had also been selected to develop. As a cost saving measure, major airframe parts and system components were shared between the two aircraft. They use the same basic wing structure, although it is installed at different sweep angle and dihedral on the two versions, with different high lift devices and powerplant attachments. Common components include the cockpit windows, outer wings, horizontal stabilizer, and other systems. Internal shared parts include the auxiliary power unit, cockpit panel, flight control system computer, <b>anti-collision</b> <b>lights,</b> and gear control unit. As of 2007, the total development cost for the two aircraft has been 345 billion yen (or roughly equal to $2.9 billion), which is low compared to similar programs; for example, the development contract for the Boeing P-8 Poseidon alone was $3.89 billion.|$|E

50|$|In civil aviation, pilots {{must keep}} {{navigation}} lights on from sunset to sunrise. High-intensity white strobe lights {{are part of}} the <b>anti-collision</b> <b>light</b> system, as well as the red rotating beacon.|$|R

50|$|<b>Anti-collision</b> <b>lights,</b> {{also known}} as Beacon lights or Strobe lights are a set of lights {{required}} on every aircraft to improve visibility to others. Historically they have used incandescent bulbs, but recently Light-emitting diodes have been used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anti-collision</b> <b>lights</b> are {{flashing}} {{lights on the}} top and bottom of the fuselage, wingtips and tail tip. Their purpose is to alert others when something is happening that ground crew and other aircraft need to be aware of, such as running engines or entering active runways.|$|E
50|$|The Space Shuttle orbiter did {{not carry}} <b>anti-collision</b> <b>lights,</b> navigational lights, or landing lights, as the orbiter always landed {{in areas that}} had been {{specially}} cleared by both the Federal Aviation Administration and the Air Force. The Orbiter nearly always landed at either Edwards Air Force Base (California) or at the Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility (Florida), although one mission - STS-3 - landed at the White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico. Similar special clearances (no-fly zones) were also in effect at potential emergency landing sites, such as in Spain and in West Africa during all launches.|$|E
50|$|G.91 target tug: A target tug variant was {{developed}} with an under-wing pylon mounted winch and target drogue. The drogue being attached to {{an extension of}} the winch around the trailing edge, above the wing. Other modifications included a large blade aerial above the centre fuselage and an <b>anti-collision</b> <b>light</b> at the forward end of the dorsal fin.|$|R

5000|$|Indianapolis Center is {{depicted}} in the second scene of Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), in which an air traffic controller provides information and guidance to pilots of two passenger jets (Trans World Airlines, Allegheny Airlines and a fictional [...] "Air East") who are en route through the ZID flight information region to avoid collisions with each other or with an unidentified [...] "aircraft" [...] {{that appears to have}} extremely bright <b>anti-collision</b> <b>lights</b> and is [...] "exhibiting some non-ballistic motion." [...] A supervisor orders another controller to [...] "get on the horn with the 45th Recon Wing to find out if there is a test flight mission in [...] "Restricted Area 2508." [...] (The actual 45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron was based at Bergstrom Air Force Base in the mid 1970s, but was inactivated not long before the film's pre-production. The real Restricted Area 2508 is located in Southern California.) The scene concluded with a senior supervisor instructing the controller to ask the TWA and Air East pilots if they wish to officially report a UFO. Both pilots declined.|$|E
50|$|The {{first time}} close head-on remote {{photography}} {{had been used}} was in 1977 when photographer Richard Cooke, working with Sqn Ldr Alan Voyle, Senior Engineering Officer of The Red Arrows, developed a camera bracket to fit {{on the underside of}} a spare Red Arrows Folland Gnat aircraft. The pilots were carefully briefed on the ground and then, in the air, the photographer operated the camera from {{the back seat of the}} camera aircraft, using a mechanical release triggered by a solenoid, operated through the <b>anti-collision</b> <b>light.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Strobe {{lights are}} used in {{scientific}} and industrial applications, in clubs where {{they are used to}} give an illusion of slow motion, and are often used for aircraft <b>anti-collision</b> <b>lighting</b> both on aircraft themselves and also on tall stationary objects, such as television and radio towers. Other applications are in alarm systems, emergency vehicle lighting, theatrical lighting (most notably to simulate lightning), and as high-visibility running lights. [...] They are still widely used in law enforcement and other emergency vehicles, though they are slowly being replaced by LED technology in this application, as they themselves largely replaced halogen lighting. Strobes are used by scuba divers as an emergency signaling device.|$|R
50|$|All {{aircraft}} built after 11 March 1996 {{must have}} an <b>anti-collision</b> <b>light</b> system (strobe lights or rotating beacon) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. The anti-collision system is recommended in good visibility, where only strobes and beacon are required. For example, just before pushback, the pilot must keep the beacon lights on to notify ground crews that the engines are about to start. These beacon lights stay on {{for the duration of}} the flight. While taxiing, the taxi lights are on. When coming onto the runway, the taxi lights go off and the landing lights and strobes go on. When passing 10,000 feet, the landing lights are no longer required, and the pilot can elect to turn them off. The same cycle in reverse order applies when landing.|$|R
