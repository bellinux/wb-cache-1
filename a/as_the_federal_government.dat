5|$|Like other U.S. states, the {{structure}} of the government of South Dakota follows the same separation of powers <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government,</b> with executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The structure of the state government is laid out in the Constitution of South Dakota, the highest law in the state. The constitution may be amended by a majority vote of both houses of the legislature, or by voter initiative.|$|E
5|$|The Senate edited these {{amendments}} still further, making 26 {{changes of}} its own. Madison's proposal to apply {{parts of the}} Bill of Rights to the states as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> was eliminated, and the seventeen amendments were condensed to twelve, which were approved on September 9, 1789. The Senate also eliminated the last of Madison's proposed changes to the preamble.|$|E
5|$|After Yugoslavia's leader Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, long-suppressed ethnic {{nationalism}} revived and {{the individual}} republics began to assert their authority more strongly <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> weakened. Slovenia and Croatia moved towards multi-party democracy and economic reform, but Serbia's authoritarian communist President Slobodan Milošević opposed reform and sought to increase {{the power of the}} communist Yugoslav government. In 1990, Slovenia and Croatia held elections that ended communist rule and brought pro-independence nationalist parties to power in both republics. In Croatia, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party of Franjo Tuđman took office, with Tuđman as President.|$|E

5|$|By 1945, {{a divided}} highway {{designated}} Alternate US24 (US24A) was opened {{from the state}} line north to Erie. After World War II, the MSHD planned to convert several highways {{in the state to}} freeways. In planning maps from 1947, the modern I-75 corridor was included in the system that later became the Interstate Highway System. It was also included in the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955, or Yellow Book after the cover color, that was released in 1955 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> readied plans for the freeway system.|$|E
5|$|Five {{days after}} the British surrendered, Congress passed a {{resolution}} agreeing to erect a structure dedicated to commemorating {{those who participated in}} the battle. Construction of the monument was delayed, however, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> had several other financial obligations that were considered to be of a more urgent nature. The battle's centennial sparked renewed enthusiasm in the resolution and prompted the government to begin building the monument in 1881 amid national support. The structure was formally erected in 1884 and currently resides within Colonial National Historical Park.|$|E
5|$|Preservation of {{documentation}} of the legacy of residential schools was also highlighted {{as part of the}} TRC's Calls to Action. Community groups and other stakeholders have variously argued for documenting or destroying evidence and testimony of residential school abuses. On April 4, 2016, the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that documents pertaining to IAP settlements will be destroyed in 15 years if individual claimants do not request to have their documents archived. This decision was fought by the TRC as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government,</b> but argued for by religious representatives.|$|E
25|$|As well, many of Northern Ontario's major {{tourist attractions}} (e.g. Science North, Dynamic Earth, the Sault Locks, etc.) are {{agencies}} of <b>the</b> provincial or <b>federal</b> <b>governments.</b> Further, {{much of the}} funding available for economic development in Northern Ontario comes from <b>government</b> initiatives such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government's</b> <b>Federal</b> Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario (FedNor) and the provincial Northern Ontario Heritage Fund.|$|R
25|$|After {{a general}} strike by {{maritime}} workers on the West Coast began in early September 1946, President Truman named Feinsinger <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government's</b> chief mediator. <b>The</b> War Labor Board had cut wage increases won through collective bargaining nearly in half, but Feinsinger was able to negotiate {{an end to the}} strike which convinced the WLB to restore the cuts.|$|R
50|$|With {{input from}} E. M. Johnstone, a BIA land field agent, LaVatta, and Bowler, a {{proposal}} {{for the purchase of}} 1,080 acres between Highway 40 and the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks in the Truckee Canyon was submitted to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs on January 25, 1937. This land purchase was never accomplished, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government’s</b> field agent, active agent, and superintendent, could not agree on how to proceed.|$|R
5|$|The Great Depression, {{although}} negative to {{the local}} economy, also benefited the San Diego State Teachers College, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> made money available for construction projects {{in an attempt to}} stimulate the economy. For the campus, some of these construction projects included new buildings (such as a $500,000 stadium completed in 1936 and a $200,000 open air theater completed in 1941), facilities, and art works. Several federal programs were also created to give jobs to students and to increase financial aid.|$|E
5|$|With {{the coming}} of the Interstate Highway System in Michigan, the MSHD planned to convert the eastern section of US2 to a freeway between St. Ignace and Sault St. Marie. In {{planning}} maps from 1947, this highway corridor was included in the system that later became the Interstates. It was also included in the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955, or Yellow Book after the cover color, that was released in 1955 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> readied plans for the freeway system. The proposed number in 1958 was Interstate 75 (I‑75).|$|E
5|$|Lara then {{requested}} a rehearing en banc {{by the full}} court. The request was granted, and the full court reversed {{the decision of the}} three-judge panel, ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of double jeopardy. While the court noted that the Fifth Amendment allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> and a state government, it found that an Indian tribe derived its authority to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court noted that in previous Supreme Court rulings, the determination of tribal jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, not on his race as an Indian. This meant that double jeopardy attached. The United States then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E
5000|$|Between 2004 and 2006, the Leighton Kumagai Joint Venture was {{affected}} {{by a series of}} industrial disputes involving the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union. This culminated in the prosecution of 107 workers for taking illegal industrial action, by the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Prosecution of [...] "the Perth 107" [...] became a national and international cause célèbre, in part because it occurred <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government's</b> industrial relations policy WorkChoices was taking place.|$|R
5000|$|Idle No More's {{vision has}} been linked by some {{commentators}} in the press with longstanding leftist political theories of indigenism. During the protests of late 2012 and early 2013, the theoretical framework of Idle No More has been frequently articulated in the Canadian press by Pamela Palmater. Palmater has denounced what she perceives <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government's</b> [...] "assimilationist agenda". It has been suggested by others that the definition of [...] "nation" [...] is itself problematic.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> Citizen Information Center (FCIC), {{originally}} <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Consumer Information Center, is {{a department}} in the United States government's General Services Administration. FCIC, founded in 1970, began <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>government's</b> distribution outlet for free and low cost Federal consumer publications sent out from the Government Printing Office (GPO) facility in Pueblo, Colorado. Since 1970, FCIC’s mission has broadened significantly to include helping people interact with <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> via toll-free telephone numbers, print publications, and a family of web sites and other electronic resources such as Twitter and Facebook accounts.|$|R
5|$|Title to real {{property}} acquired by recipients with federal awards vests with the recipient. It {{must be used}} for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose. Real property may be used in other federally sponsored projects or programs that have purposes similar to the one the property was bought for, as long <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> authorizes it. However it may not dispose of or encumber the title to {{real property}} without prior federal government consent. When it is no longer needed for the federally supported programs or projects, the recipient must request disposition instructions from the federal government. As with equipment, if the property is sold, a proportionate share is provided to the federal government, amount of the current fair market value, based on the percent of federal funds to own recipient's fund used to acquire the item.|$|E

Linux distributions have also gained popularity with various local and national governments, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> of Brazil.|$|E
25|$|The {{uniformity}} is due {{to federal}} guidelines that states choose to adopt as motor vehicle laws are enacted by the individual states. It is said {{that the federal government}} ensures the passage of the federal guidelines by tying traffic safety highway funds to compliance with federal guidelines on certain issues, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> ensuring that the legal drinking age be the age of 21 across the 50 states. In earlier years, the range of the threshold varied considerably between States.|$|E

The Chrétien loyalist Senator Terry Mercer delivered a speech attacking [...] "asymmetrical federalism" [...] as a betrayal of everything the Liberals had worked for and believed in over the 20th century and as potentially threatening to national unity. Mercer's speech was generally believed to have reflected Chrétien's view of [...] "asymmetrical federalism".|$|R

25|$|On July 1, 1846 Captain James Allen, {{dispatched}} by Colonel (later Brigadier General) Stephen W. Kearny, {{arrived at}} the Mormons' Mosquito Creek camp. He carried President Polk's request for a battalion of 500 volunteers {{to fight in the}} Mexican War. Most members of the Church were suspicious of the request, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> had ignored the persecutions they suffered. They were concerned about facing discrimination by the government, as they had from both the state and federal government in the past.|$|E
25|$|The {{governor}} {{was the head}} of the territorial government.

25|$|The union, {{like most}} other United States {{construction}} unions, had remained nearly all-white {{for most of its}} history.
