Farnesyltransferase's targets include members of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins critical to cell cycle progression. For this reason, several FTase inhibitors are undergoing testing as anti-cancer agents. FTase inhibitors have shown efficacy as <b>anti-parasitic</b> <b>agents,</b> as well.

5000|$|... 3-Dehydroquinate synthase catalyzes {{the second}} step in the shikimate pathway, which is {{essential}} for the production of aromatic amino acids in bacteria, plants, and fungi, but not mammals. This makes it an ideal target for new antimicrobial agents, <b>anti-parasitic</b> <b>agents,</b> and herbicides. Other enzymes in the shikimate pathway have already been targeted and put to use as herbicides. Roundup, a common herbicide made by Monsanto, works by inhibiting another enzyme in the shikimate pathway. The shikimate pathway is an ideal choice for herbicides because this pathway does not exist in animals or people so people are not directly affected. Roundup uses an enzyme inhibitor, glyphosate, to block one of the steps of the shikimate pathway. Glyphosate inhibits 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSP synthase), which ultimately blocks the production of aromatic amino acids, and, without aromatic amino acids, plants cannot survive. However, Monsanto developed a bacterial form of EPSP synthase that was not inhibited by Roundup. Monsanto introduced this gene into plants using agrobacterium and the result was a plant that was resistant to Roundup. This meant that all plants without the bacterial gene would die, leading a much higher degree of weed control.|$|E

Mechanistically, transcriptomic analysis and gene silencing experiments revealed that ivermectin increased mitochondrial ATP production by inducing Cox 6 a 2, a subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Furthermore, ivermectin inhibited the hypertrophic response of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Pharmacological inhibition of importin β, one of the targets of ivermectin, exhibited protection against mitochondrial ATP decline and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

Ruthenium-based complexes have been widely examined for their anti-cancer and anti-microbial properties. Due to their unique properties, the interactions of ruthenium complexes with different biological targets, particularly with nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) have been extensively investigated. However, the protein binding and enzyme inhibition properties of ruthenium complexes are less well explored. This thesis aimed at exploring the enzyme inhibition properties of a class of inert oligonuclear polypyridylruthenium(II) complexes (Rubbn) containing the flexible linking ligand bbn, {where bbn = bis[4 (4 '-methyl- 2, 2 '-bipyridyl) ]- 1,n-alkane (n = 7, 12 and 16) } and particularly in their potential as novel <b>anti-parasitic</b> <b>agents.</b> 	A series of mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-nuclear complexes have been synthesised and their ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase enzymes (AChEs) in various parasite extracts was examined. The Rubbn complexes selectively inhibited the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) at sub-micromolar concentrations (IC₅₀ MKP- 1 > CDC 25 B. The results of the study also suggested that the tetra-nuclear complexes have the potential to regulate the amount of phosphatase enzyme (MKP- 1) synthesised in live cancer cells. However, the Rubbn complexes were less active (between 60 - and 200 -fold) against the phosphatase enzymes,compared to parasite AChE. The combined results of the enzyme inhibition studies highlight the selectivity of the Rubbn complexes for parasite AChE. 	The results of this study demonstrates the significant potential of the oligonuclear polypyridylruthenium(II) complexes as <b>anti-parasitic</b> <b>agents.</b> More importantly, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first investigation on inhibitory properties of Rubbn complexes against parasite AChEs and the information provided in this thesis will advance our knowledge in the understanding of enzyme inhibition properties of ruthenium-based complexes and in developing them as therapeutic agents...|$|E

We have performed a repositioning screen for WNT-TCF response blockers aiming to recapitulate the genetic blockade afforded by dominant-negative TCF. We report that Ivermectin inhibits the expression of WNT-TCF targets, mimicking dnTCF, and that its low concentration effects are rescued by direct activation by TCF(VP 16). Ivermectin inhibits the proliferation and increases apoptosis of various human cancer types. It represses the levels of C-terminal β-CATENIN phosphoforms and of CYCLIN D 1 in an okadaic acid-sensitive manner, indicating its action involves protein phosphatases.

Halofuginone also effectively suppresses tumor progression and metastasis in mice. These results together with the well-documented role of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and matrix degrading enzymes in formation of new blood vessels led us to investigate the effect of halofuginone on the angiogenic process. In a variety of experimental system, representing sequential events in the angiogenic cascade, halofuginone treatment resulted in profound inhibitory effect. Among these are the abrogation of endothelial cell MMP- 2 expression and basement membrane invasion, capillary tube formation, and vascular sprouting, as well as deposition of subendothelial ECM.

The enzyme that catalyzes this process, N-myristoyltransferase (NMT), {{has been characterized}} in the kinetoplastid protozoan parasites, Leishmania and Trypanosoma brucei. In Leishmania major, the single copy NMT gene is constitutively expressed in all parasite stages as a 48. 5 -kDa protein that localizes to both membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. Leishmania NMT myristoylates the target acylated Leishmania protein, HASPA, when both are co-expressed in Escherichia coli. Gene targeting experiments have shown that NMT activity is essential for viability in Leishmania. In addition, overexpression of NMT causes gross changes in parasite morphology, including the subcellular accumulation of lipids, leading to cell death. This phenotype is more extreme than that observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which overexpression of NMT activity has no obvious effects on growth kinetics or cell morphology.

Cumulative evidence from studies of Trypanosoma species and malaria parasites has shown that cysteine protease inhibitors represent potent <b>anti-parasitic</b> <b>agents</b> capable of curing infections in vivo.

Like mosquito traps, feeders could divert biting mosquitoes away from people by means of lures, but, after diversion, prevent subsequent human bites by satiating the mosquitoes instead of killing them. Mosquito feeders might reduce the problem of the evolution of resistance to control: in an ecology with mosquito feeders, which provide safe and abundant calories for adult female mosquitoes, there could be selection for preferring (rather than avoiding) feeders, which could eventually lead to a population of feeder-preferring mosquitoes. Artificial feeders also offer the chance to introduce novel elements into the mosquito diet, such as anti-malarial or other <b>anti-parasitic</b> <b>agents.</b> Feeders might directly reduce human bites and harnesses the power of natural selection by selectively favoring feeder-preferring (rather than trap-resistant) mosquitoes...|$|E

40|$|Racemic {{difluoromethylornithine}} (D/L-DFMO) is an inhibitor of ODC (ornithine decarboxylase), {{the first}} enzyme in eukaryotic polyamine biosynthesis. D/L-DFMO {{is an effective}} <b>anti-parasitic</b> <b>agent</b> and inhibitor of mammalian cell growth and development. Purified human ODC-catalysed ornithine decarboxylation is highly stereospecific. However, both DFMO enantiomers suppressed ODC activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. ODC activity failed to recover after treatment with either L- or D-DFMO and dialysis to remove free inhibitor. The inhibitor dissociation constant (K(D)) values {{for the formation of}} enzyme-inhibitor complexes were 28. 3 +/- 3. 4, 1. 3 +/- 0. 3 and 2. 2 +/- 0. 4 microM respectively for D-, L- and D/L-DFMO. The differences in these K(D) values were statistically significant (P 0. 1). D-DFMO was a more potent inhibitor (IC 50 approximately 7. 5 microM) when compared with D-ornithine (IC 50 approximately 1. 5 mM) of ODC-catalysed L-ornithine decarboxylation. Treatment of human colon tumour-derived HCT 116 cells with either L- or D-DFMO decreased the cellular polyamine contents in a concentration-dependent manner. These results show that both enantiomers of DFMO irreversibly inactivate ODC and suggest that this inactivation occurs by a common mechanism. Both enantiomers form enzyme-inhibitor complexes with ODC, but the probability of formation of these complexes is 20 times greater for L-DFMO when compared with D-DFMO. The rate of the irreversible reaction in ODC inactivation is similar for the L- and D-enantiomer. This unexpected similarity between DFMO enantiomers, in contrast with the high degree of stereospecificity of the substrate ornithine, appears to be due to the alpha-substituent of the inhibitor. The D-enantiomer may have advantages, such as decreased normal tissue toxicity, over L- or D/L-DFMO in some clinical applications...|$|R
50|$|In 1968, Menaker {{provided}} {{evidence for the}} existence of extra-retinal photoreceptors that were sufficient for photoentrainment by measuring rhythmic locomotor behavior as the output signal of the house sparrows (Passer domesticus) circadian clock. He demonstrated that photoentrainment could occur in the absence of optic neurons, evidence for the presence of an extra-retinal photoreceptor(s) coupled to the House Sparrow circadian clock. In this experiment, bilaterally enucleated house sparrows were exposed to an artificial light-dark cycle. They were kept in constant darkness to determine their free-running period and subsequently allowed to entrain to light cues. Locomotor activity was recorded through observing perching behavior of the sparrows. He tested three possible confounding variables for entrainment: (1) temperature fluctuation, (2) post-enucleation retinal fragments remaining in the eye, and (3) ectoparasites that might transfer light information through their movements in the birds' skin. To study the effects of temperature on circadian rhythms, Menaker exposed the enucleated sparrows to an electroluminescent panel. Menaker treated sparrows with Dry-Die, an <b>anti-parasitic</b> <b>agent,</b> to eliminate any possible effects of light transferring by ectoparasites. Since the sparrows did not entrain during tests of temperature fluctuation and the sparrows remained entrained 10 months after enucleation, a point at which any excess of the functional retina would have degraded, Menaker ruled out these possible confounding variables. Menaker's lab concluded the sparrows were able to entrain to environmental light cues. These results demonstrate that retinal light receptors are not necessary for photoentrainment, indicating there is an extra-retinal photoreceptor(s) contributing to circadian locomotor activity. Menaker's findings in enucleated sparrows were consistent with Aschoff’s Rule, and he concluded that the retinae and the extra-retinal receptor(s) both contribute to the photoentrainment process.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} for controlling mosquito-borne diseases. In particular, {{instead of trying}} to kill mosquitoes, we suggest provisioning them with food from artificial feeders. Because mosquito populations are frequently limited by ecological factors other than blood meals, such as the availability of egg-laying sites, feeding mosquitoes would not necessarily increase the total number of mosquitoes, but could reduce the number of human-drawn mosquito meals. Like mosquito traps, feeders could divert biting mosquitoes away from people by means of lures, but, after diversion, prevent subsequent human bites by satiating the mosquitoes instead of killing them. Mosquito feeders might reduce the problem of the evolution of resistance to control: in an ecology with mosquito feeders, which provide safe and abundant calories for adult female mosquitoes, there could be selection for preferring (rather than avoiding) feeders, which could eventually lead to a population of feeder-preferring mosquitoes. Artificial feeders also offer the chance to introduce novel elements into the mosquito diet, such as anti-malarial or other <b>anti-parasitic</b> <b>agents.</b> Feeders might directly reduce human bites and harnesses the power of natural selection by selectively favoring feeder-preferring (rather than trap-resistant) mosquitoes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEvidence that prevention, {{diagnosis}} and treatment of toxoplasmosis is beneficial developed as follows: <b>anti-parasitic</b> <b>agents</b> abrogate Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoite growth, preventing destruction of infected, cultured, mammalian cells and cure active infections in experimental animals, including primates. They treat active infections in persons who are immune-compromised, limit destruction of retina by replicating parasites and thereby treat ocular toxoplasmosis and treat active infection in the fetus and infant. Outcomes of untreated congenital toxoplasmosis include adverse ocular and neurologic sequelae described in different countries and decades. Better outcomes are associated with treatment of infected infants throughout their first year of life. Shorter intervals between {{diagnosis and}} treatment in utero improve outcomes. A French approach for {{diagnosis and treatment}} of congenital toxoplasmosis in the fetus and infant can prevent toxoplasmosis and limit adverse sequelae. In addition, new data demonstrate that this French approach results in favorable outcomes with some early gestation infections. A standardized approach to diagnosis and treatment during gestation has not yet been applied generally in the USA. Nonetheless, a small, similar experience confirms that this French approach is feasible, safe, and results in favorable outcomes in the National Collaborative Chicago-based Congenital Toxoplasmosis Study cohort. Prompt diagnosis, prevention and treatment reduce adverse sequelae of congenital toxoplasmosis...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondria {{could be}} a good target for anti-parasitic drugs. The a and b {{subunits}} of mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) and the core subunits of the cytochrome bc 1 complex, UCR- 1 and UCR- 2, are homologous to one another and are important for mitochondrial functions. However, our knowledge of these proteins in nematodes is very limited. Caenorhabditis elegans, a free-living nematode, has six genes coding for proteins homologous to these subunits. On primary structure comparison, and immunochemical and enzymological analyses, the gene products were assigned as follows: Y 71 G 12 B. 24, a-MPP; ZC 410. 2, b-MPP; F 56 D 2. 1, UCR- 1; VW 06 B 3 R. 1, T 10 B 10. 2; and T 24 C 4. 1, UCR- 2. The primary structures of b-MPP and UCR- 1 from Brugia malayi, a parasitic nematode causing human filariasis, were deduced from their cDNA structures. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the UCR- 1 s from both C. elegans and B. malayiwere less related tomammalianUCR- 1 s than toMPPs fromvarious organisms.

This suggests the possibility that these proteins are also essential for the viability of B. malayi and other parasitic nematodes, and are potential targets for <b>anti-parasitic</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: The P 2 X 4 {{receptor}} {{is thought}} to be involved in regulating alcohol-consuming behaviors and ethanol (EtOH) has been reported to inhibit P 2 X 4 receptors. Ivermectin is an <b>anti-parasitic</b> <b>agent</b> that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the P 2 X 4 receptor. The current study examined the effects of systemically- and centrally-administered ivermectin on alcohol drinking of replicate lines of high-alcohol-drinking (HAD- 1 /HAD- 2) rats, and the effects of lentiviral-delivered short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting P 2 rx 4 on EtOH intake of female HAD 2 rats. Method: For the 1 st experiment, adult male HAD- 1 & HAD- 2 rats were given 24 -hr free-choice access to 15 % EtOH vs. water. Dose-response effects of ivermectin (1. 5 to 7. 5 mg/kg i. p.) on EtOH intake were determined; the effects of ivermectin were then examined for 2 % w/v sucrose intake over 5 consecutive days. In the 2 nd experiment, female HAD- 2 rats were trained to consume 15 % EtOH under 2 -hr limited access conditions, and dose-response effects of intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of ivermectin (0. 5 to 2. 0 μg) were determined over 5 consecutive days. The 3 rd experiment determined the effects of microinfusion of a lentivirus expressing P 2 rx 4 shRNAs into the posterior ventral tegmental area (VTA) on 24 -hr EtOH free-choice drinking of female HAD- 2 rats. Results: The highest i. p. dose of ivermectin reduced alcohol drinking (30 - 45 %) in both rat lines, but did not alter sucrose intake. HAD- 2 rats appeared to be more sensitive than HAD 1 rats to the effects of ivermectin. ICV administration of ivermectin reduced 2 -hr limited access intake (∼ 35 %) of femal...|$|R

Using a polyclonal antiserum prepared against recombinant protein, we have detected one of these ribonucleases, RNase 4, in lysates of normal human peripheral blood monocytes, but not granulocytes or lymphocytes, by Western blotting. Subcellular localization by immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated the presence of RNase 4 in the cytoplasmic granules of isolated monocytes. Interestingly, mRNA encoding RNase 4 could not be detected in freshly isolated monocytes, emerging only after 16 h in culture, suggesting the possibility of de novo protein synthesis in association with monocyte differentiation...|$|R
