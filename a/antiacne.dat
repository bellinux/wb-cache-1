40|$|Abstract: Acne {{pathogenesis}} {{has recently}} been linked to decreased nuclear FoxO 1 levels and increased mTORC 1 activity. This hypothesis postulates that <b>antiacne</b> agents either enhance nuclear FoxO activity or inhibit mTORC 1. Benzoyl peroxide (BPO), by activation of oxidative stress-inducible kinases, increases nuclear FoxO levels promoting Sestrin 3 -mediated AMPK activation. Furthermore, BPO-derived ROS may activate AMPK via ataxia– telangiectasia mutated. Isotretinoin and all-trans retinoic acid may stimulate FoxO gene expression. Doxycycline may enhance FoxOs nuclear retention by inhibiting the expression of exportin 1. Suppression of TNFa signalling by tetracyclines, erythromycin and other macrolides may attenuate IKKb-TSC 1 -mediated mTORC 1 activation. Erythromycin attenuates ERK 1 / 2 activity and thereby increases TSC 2. Azelaic acid may decrease mTORC 1 by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration, increasing cellular ROS and nuclear FoxO levels. Antiandrogens may attenuate mTORC 1 by suppressing mTORC 2 -mediated Akt/TSC 2 signalling. This hypothesis unmasks a common mode of action of <b>antiacne</b> agents as either FoxO enhancers or mTORC 1 inhibitors and thus provides a rational approach {{for the development of}} new <b>antiacne</b> agents.

40|$|Background : Acne vulgaris is {{characterized}} by the enhancement of sebaceous lipogenesis and sebum secretion, and apart from retinoids and some natural products there are few effective <b>antiacne</b> agents that directly suppress sebum production and accumulation in sebaceous glands. Objective : We examined the effects of β -cryptoxanthin (β -CRX), which is a carotenoid pigment most abundant in Citrus unshiu Marcovich (Satsuma mandarin orange) and plays a role as a vitamin A precursor on sebum production and accumulation in hamster sebaceous gland cells (sebocytes). Materials and methods : The regulation of sebum production was examined by the measurement of triacylglycerols (TGs), the major sebum component, and oil red O staining in insulindifferentiated hamster sebocytes. The expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase- 1 (DGAT- 1), a rate-limiting enzyme of TG biosynthesis, and perilipin 1 (PLIN 1), a lipid storage droplet protein, was analyzed using real-time PCR and Western blotting. Results : Hamster sebocytes constitutively produced TGs during cultivation and the production of TGs was enhanced by insulin treatment. Both constitutive and insulin-enhanced TG productions were dose- and time-dependently inhibited by β -CRX as well as 13 - cis retinoic acid. In addition, the gene expression of DGAT- 1 was suppressed by β -CRX in the sebocytes. Furthermore, the insulin-en - hanced sebum accumulation as lipid droplets was reduced in the β -CRX-treated cells. Moreover, β -CRX was found to suppress the gene expression and production of PLIN 1 in insulin-differentiated hamster sebocytes. Conclusions : These results provide novel evidence that β -CRX is an effective candidate for acne therapy by its ability to exert dual inhibitory actions against DGAT- 1 -dependent TG production and PLIN 1 -mediated lipiddroplet formation in hamster sebocytes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease, and its treatment is challenging {{due to the}} multifactorial etiology and emergence of antibiotic-resistant Propionibacterium acnes strains. This study was focused to reduce antibiotics usage and find an alternate therapeutic source for treating acne. Lipid extracts of six Chlorella species were tested for inhibition of lipase, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cytokine production using P. acnes (Microbial Type Culture Collection 1951). Lipase inhibitory assay was determined by dimercaprol Tributyrate - 5, 5 ′- dithiobis 2 -nitrobenzoic acid method and ROS production assay was performed using nitro-blue tetrazolium test. The anti-inflammatory activity of algal lipid extracts was determined by in vitro screening method based on inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) produced by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of lipid extracts were determined by microdilution method, and the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Chlorella ellipsoidea has the highest lipase inhibitory activity with 61. 73 % inhibition, followed by Chlorella vulgaris (60. 31 %) and Chlorella protothecoides (58. 9 %). Lipid extracts from C. protothecoides and C. ellipsoidea has significantly reduced the ROS production by 61. 27 % and 58. 34 % respectively. Inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α showed the inhibition ranging from 58. 39 % to 78. 67 %.

40|$|Clinical {{relevance}} of antibiotic resistance among propionibatteria carried by acne patients in Ferrara (Italy) is discussedAim. Antibiotics {{reducing the number}} of propionibacteria on the skin represent powerful agents in the treatment of inflammatory acne. The widespread use of both oral and topical antibiotics to treat acne has resulted in the dissemination of propionibacterial-resistant strains. Failure of therapy associated with the selection of antibiotic-resistant propionibacteria is a well recognized concern. The aim of the study is to determine the prevalence of skin colonization by antibiotic-resistant propionibacteria in a large number of acne patients attending our department and to monitor changes over a six-year period (April 2000 -October 2005). Methods. From April 2000 we have tested the susceptibility to the most commonly used <b>antiacne</b> antibiotics of the propionibacterial strains carried by the patients with acne, proposed to be treated with antibiotic. Propionibacterial samples were obtained from the skin surface of the face of 1579 acne patients using a moistened swab. The swabs were used to inoculate agar plates containing selective concentrations of tetracycline, minocycline, erythromycin and clindamycin, as well as antibiotic-free control plates. After 7 days of anaerobic incubation at 37 °C, a semiquantitative method (a scale from 0 to 5 +) was applied to estimate the amount of growth in the presence of each antibiotic. Results. Propionibacteria were isolated in 1508 of 1579 patients sampled. The prevalence of carriage of isolates resistant to at least one antibiotic was 55. 9 %. Resistance to erythromycin was the most common in all years ranging from 58. 8 % in 2000 to 38. 5 % in 2005 (mean prevalence 47. 7 %); resistance to clindamycin ranged from 44. 1 % in 2000 to 32. 2 % in 2005 (mean 39. 2 %). Thirty-five percent of the isolated strains were resistant to both erythromycin and clindamycin. Rates of resistance to tetracyclines were very low (1. 9 % to tetracycline and 0. 6 % to minocycline). Mild reduction in resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin was noticed over the period of samples collection. The highest rates of resistance were found in older patients and slightly higher rates in males than in females. Conclusion. The available data show a wide distribution of propionibacterial strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin in the large number of patients sampled. At present, resistance rates to oral tetracyclines are very low. These findings support the significance of the cultural definition of antibiotic sensitivity of propionibacteria isolated from acne patients.

The phenotypes and genotypes of 73 antibiotic-resistant strains of P. acnes obtained from the skin of acne patients in the U. K., U. S. A., France, Germany, Australia and Japan were compared. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements, and polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing were used to identify mutations in genes encoding rRNA. Most erythromycin-resistant isolates (MIC 90 ¿ 512 ¿g mL¿ 1) were cross-resistant to clindamycin but at a much lower level (MIC 90 ¿ 64 ¿g mL¿ 1). As in the U. K., resistance to erythromycin was associated with point mutations in 23 S rRNA in 49 of 58 strains. An A¿G transition at Escherichia coli equivalent base 2058 was present in 24 strains. This gave a unique cross-resistance phenotype against a panel of macrolide, lincosamide and type B streptogramin antibiotics. Two further point mutations (at E. coli equivalent bases 2057 and 2059) were identified (in three and 22 isolates, respectively) and these were also associated with specific cross-resistance patterns originally identified in isolates from the U. K. However, nine of 10 erythromycin resistant-strains from Germany did not exhibit any of the three base mutations identified and, in six cases, cross-resistance patterns were atypical. Consistent with previous U. K. data, 34 of 38 tetracycline-resistant strains carried a base mutation at E. coli 16 S rRNA equivalent base 1058. Tetracycline-resistant isolates displayed varying degrees of cross-resistance to doxycycline and minocycline, but isolates from the U. S. A. had higher MICs for minocycline (4 ¿ 16 ¿g mL¿ 1) than isolates from other countries and, in particular, Australia. All the P. acnes isolates resistant to {{one or more of the}} commonly used <b>antiacne</b> antibiotics were sensitive to penicillin, fusidic acid, chloramphenicol and the fluoroquinolone, nadifloxacin. All but one isolate (from the U. K.) were sensitive to trimethoprim. This study shows that 23 S and 16 S mutations identified in the U. K. conferring antibiotic resistance in P. acnes are distributed widely. However, resistant strains were isolated in which mutations could not be identified, suggesting that as yet uncharacterized resistance mechanisms have evolved. This is the first report of high-level resistance to minocycline and is of concern as these strains are predicted to be clinically resistant and are unlikely to remain confined to the U. S. A. Epidemiological studies are urgently required to monitor how resistant strains are selected, how they spread and to ascertain whether the prevalence of resistance correlates with antibiotic usage patterns in the different countries...|$|E
40|$|Hyper-pigmentation of {{the skin}} is a common problem that is {{prevalent}} in middle aged and elderly people. It is caused by over production of melanin, the pigment {{that is responsible for}} the colour of hair and skin in humans. Tyrosinase is known to be the key enzyme in melanin production. Forty plants belonging to different families were tested for their activity on tyrosinase using L-tyrosine as a substrate. Ethanolic leaf extract of Greyia flanaganii (Bolus) showed significant (p< 0. 05) inhibitory activity exhibiting the 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 32. 62 μg/ml. It was further investigated for its toxicity and effect on melanin production by melanocytes cells. G. Flanaganii showed significant (P< 0. 05) 20 % reduction of melanin at 6. 25 μg/ml while 80 % of cells were found to be viable, thus indicating low levels of cytotoxicity (IC 50 < 400 μg/ml). The 1. 2 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method was used to quantify the total radical scavenging capacity (RSC) of the extract. The amount of antioxidants necessary to decrease the initial DPPH absorbance by 50 % (EC 50) by the ethanol extract of the leaves of G. Flanaganii was found to be 22. 01 μg/ml. ‘Acne vulgaris’ is a chronic inflammatory follicular disorder {{of the skin}} that affects areas containing thelargest oil glands including face, neck, back and chest. It affects up to 80 % of adolescents to some extent and less commonly occurs in infants (Shaw and Kennedy, 2007). Propionibacterium acnes is an obligate anaerobic gram-positive bacterium that is associated with or linked to ‘Acne vulgaris’. It is largely commensal and is present on most people’s skin and live on fatty acids in the sebaceous glands on sebum secreted by pores. The effect Greyia flanaganii (Bolus) against acne causing bacteria, P. acnes was investigated using microdilution assay. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extract of G. Flanaganiiwas found to be 250 μg/ml. A bioassay guided fractionation of the ethanolic leaf extract of G. Flanaganii let to the isolation of six known compounds and one novel phenolic compound. Isolated compounds were; 2 ’, 6 ’, 4 -trihydroxy- 4 ’-methoxydihydrochalcone (asebogenin/lyonogenin) (C 1), 2 ’, 4 ’, 6 ’-trihydroxydihydrochalcone (C 2), 2 ’, 6 ’- dihydroxy- 4 ’, 4 -dimethoxydihydrochalcone (C 3), (2 R, 3 R) - 3,. 5, 7 -trihydroxy- 3 -Oacetylflavanone (pinobanksin- 3 -acetate/dihydrogalangin- 3 -acetate) (C 4), 2 ’, 6 ’- dihydroxy- 4 ’-methoxydihydrochalcone (C 5), 5, 7 -dihydroxyflavanone [(2 S) - pinocembrin] (C 6) and 4 -hydroxyphenethyl 3 -hydroxy- 5 -phenylpentanoate (C 7). C 1 -C 6 are well known compounds whereas C 7 is a novel compound. The isolated compounds were tested for their cytotoxicity, antioxidant, tyrosinase inhibitory and antibacterial activities. C 3 and C 4 were only tested on tyrosinase due to low yield of these compounds during isolation. C 2 exhibited significant (p< 0. 05) antityrosinase activity exhibiting the IC 50 of 69. 15 μM. <b<C 1, C 4, C 5, C 6 and C 7 also showed significant (p< 0. 05) inhibitory activity of the tyrosinase enzyme exhibiting 11. 5, 35, 24, 22 and 31 % enzyme inhibition respectively at 200 μg/ml. C 3 did not show any significant inhibition of the enzyme at the highest concentration tested (200 μìg/ml). C 6 showed low toxicity effect on melanocytes cells, IC 50 of 373 μM was observed and about 10 % reduction of melanin content was found at 1. 5 μg/ml. All the compounds tested for antioxidant activity exhibited good radical scavenging activity. The EC 50 (concentration of extract which decreases the initial DPPH absorbance by 50 %) values of C 2, C 1, C 5 and C 7 was found to be ranging from 3. 46 to 76. 1 μM. The EC 50 of the positive control used (vitamin C) was found to be 11. 3 μM. The isolated compounds were also tested for their activity against P. Acnes. C 2, C 7 and C 1 exhibited MIC values of 968, 1590 and 418 μM respectively. The positive drug control; erythromycin exhibited an MIC of 136 μM. The cytotoxicity, antityrosinase, antioxidant and antibacterial activity of G. flanaganii extract are being reported for the first time. Other flavonoid compounds such as pinistrobin, 7 - methyleriodictyol, dihydrogalangin, chrysin etc have been previously isolated from this plant but all the isolated compounds in this study have been isolated for the first time from G. Flanaganii. C 2 which showed the best antityrosinase activity (IC 50 value of 69. 1 μM) as compared to the other samples tested in the present study. This sample also showed low cytotoxicity on melanocytes cells (IC 50 219 μM) and resulted in 10 % reduction of melanin at 3. 125 μg/ml. Therefore, this compound can be considered for its use for the treatment of skin hyper-pigmentation problems. C 1 which showed low MIC (418 μM) as compared to positive drug should be considered for further studies in clinical trials for a possible <b>antiacne</b> agent. C 2 and C 1 which exhibited an EC 50 value of 3. 46 and 6. 69 μM respectively seem to have good antioxidant activity and can be considered for their use as UV protecting agents. Based on these results, it shows that the leaf extract of Greyia flanaganii and C 2 have some potential to be considered as a possible anti-tyrosinase agent though their mechanism studies need to be done in detail to support their possibilities of being used to treat hyper-pigmentation problems.
