5|$|In the 1930s Blyton {{developed}} {{an interest in}} writing stories related to various myths, including those of <b>ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> and Rome; The Knights of the Round Table, Tales of <b>Ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> and Tales of Robin Hood were published in 1930. In Tales of <b>Ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> Blyton retold sixteen well-known ancient Greek myths, but used the Latin rather than the Greek names of deities and invented conversations between the characters. The Adventures of Odysseus, Tales of the Ancient Greeks and Persians and Tales of the Romans followed in 1934.|$|E
5|$|Slavery in <b>ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> was {{a common}} practice, as was slavery in other {{societies}} at the time. Some writers in <b>ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> (including, most notably, Aristotle) considered slavery natural and even necessary. This paradigm was notably questioned in Socratic dialogues; the Stoics produced the first recorded condemnation of slavery.|$|E

5|$|Greek mythology is {{the body}} of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, {{concerning}} their gods and heroes, {{the nature of the}} world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It {{was a part of the}} religion in <b>ancient</b> <b>Greece.</b> Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of <b>ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.|$|E
5|$|William Stearn wrote {{extensively}} {{on the history of}} botany and horticulture, from <b>Ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> to his own times. He collected together J. E. Raven's 1976 J. H.

5|$|In the Chalcolithic era around 5600 BC, the mother-goddess of Çatalhöyük, a large ancient {{settlement}} in southern Anatolia, was depicted astride two leopards wearing a costume somewhat like a bikini. Two-piece garments worn by women for athletic purposes are depicted on Greek urns and paintings {{dating back to}} 1400 BC. Active women of <b>ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> wore a breastband called a mastodeton or an apodesmos, which continued {{to be used as}} an undergarment in the Middle Ages. While men in <b>ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> abandoned the perizoma, partly high-cut briefs and partly loincloth, women performers and acrobats continued to wear it.|$|E
5|$|Mantises were {{considered}} to have supernatural powers by early civilizations, including <b>Ancient</b> <b>Greece,</b> Ancient Egypt, and Assyria. A cultural trope popular in cartoons imagines the female mantis as a femme fatale. Mantises are among the insects most commonly kept as pets.|$|E

5|$|Winckelmann’s {{theories}} {{on the evolution}} of art culminated in the Sublime period of Greek art, which had been conceived during a period of complete political and religious liberty. The theories idealised <b>Ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> and increased people’s desire to travel to contemporary Greece. It was seductive to believe, as he did, that 'good taste' was born beneath the Greek sky. He convinced 18th-century Europe that life in <b>Ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> was pure, simple and moral, and that classical Hellas was the source from which artists should draw ideas of “noble simplicity and calm grandeur”. Greece became the “motherland of the arts” and “the teacher of taste”.|$|E

5|$|Descriptions of the {{tactical}} role of chariots in <b>Ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> and Rome are rare. The Iliad, possibly referring to Mycenaen practices used c.1250 BC, describes {{the use of}} chariots for transporting warriors to and from battle, rather than for actual fighting. Later, Julius Caesar, invading Britain in 55 and 54 BC, noted British charioteers throwing javelins, then leaving their chariots to fight on foot.|$|E
5|$|History {{is often}} {{analyzed}} with contemporary ideologies; <b>Ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> {{as a subject}} enjoyed popularity by the ruling class in Britain during the 19th century. Based on their social priorities, British scholars interpreted <b>ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> as a westernized, white, and masculine society, and essentially removed women from historical importance. Women in Greece were sequestered with each other, and men with men. In this homosocial environment, erotic and sexual relationships between males were common and recorded in literature, art, and philosophy. Hardly anything is recorded about homosexual activity between women. There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls. The poet Alcman used the term aitis, as the feminine form of aites—which was the official term for the younger participant in a pederastic relationship. Aristophanes, in Plato's Symposium, mentions women who love women, but uses the term trepesthai (to be focused on) instead of eros, which was applied to other erotic relationships between men, and between men and women.|$|E

5|$|Human {{beekeeping}} or apiculture {{has been}} practised for millennia, {{since at least}} the times of Ancient Egypt and <b>Ancient</b> <b>Greece.</b> Apart from honey and pollination, honey bees produce beeswax, royal jelly and propolis.

5|$|In {{chemistry}} and physics, atomic theory is a scientific {{theory of the}} nature of matter, which states that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms. It began as a philosophical concept in <b>ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> and entered the scientific mainstream in the early 19th century when discoveries in the field of chemistry showed that matter did indeed behave as if it were made up of atoms.|$|E
5|$|Initially, in <b>Ancient</b> <b>Greece,</b> {{homophony}} indicated {{music in}} which a single melody is performed by two or more voices in unison or octaves, i.e. monophony with multiple voices.
