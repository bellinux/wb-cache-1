5|$|Hong Kong had two {{licensed}} terrestrial broadcasters â€“ ATV and TVB, {{the former}} {{of which has}} now been defunct. There are three local {{and a number of}} foreign suppliers of cable and satellite services. The production of Hong Kong's soap dramas, comedy series, and variety shows reach audiences throughout the Cantonese-speaking population. Magazine and newspaper publishers in Hong Kong distribute and print in both Chinese and English, with a focus on sensationalism and celebrity gossip. The media in Hong Kong is relatively free from official interference compared to Mainland China, although the Far Eastern Economic Review pointed to signs of self-censorship by media whose owners have close ties to or business interests in the People's Republic of China and states that even Western media outlets <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> to growing Chinese economic power.|$|E

25|$|Herd {{immunity}} (also called herd effect, community immunity, population immunity, {{or social}} immunity) {{is a form}} of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when a large percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, thereby providing a measure of protection for individuals who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune.</b> In a population in which a large number of individuals are immune, chains of infection are likely to be disrupted, which stops or slows the spread of disease. The greater the proportion of individuals in a community who are immune, the smaller the probability that those who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> will come into contact with an infectious individual.|$|E

Most insidiously, spammers hack into {{accounts and}} send false links {{under the guise}} of a user's trusted contacts such as friends and family. As for Twitter, spammers gain credibility by following verified accounts such as that of Lady Gaga; when that account owner follows the spammer back, it legitimizes the spammer and allows him or her to proliferate.|$|E
25|$|Varicella vaccine, {{also known}} as {{chickenpox}} vaccine, is a vaccine that protects against chickenpox. One dose of vaccine prevents 95% of moderate disease and 100% of severe disease. Two doses of vaccine are more effective than one. If given to those who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> within five days of exposure to chickenpox it prevents most cases of disease. Vaccinating {{a large portion of}} the population also protects those who are not vaccinated. It is given by injection just under the skin.|$|E

25|$|Measles is an {{airborne}} disease which spreads easily {{through the}} coughs and sneezes of those infected. It {{may also be}} spread through contact with saliva or nasal secretions. Nine out of ten people who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> and share living space with an infected person will catch it. People are infectious to others from four days before to {{four days after the}} start of the rash. People usually do not get the disease more than once. Testing for the virus in suspected cases is important for public health efforts.|$|E
25|$|There is a mutualistic {{relationship}} between sea anemones and clownfish. This gives the sea anemones a second line of defence. They are guarded by fiercely territorial clownfish, {{who are also}} immune to the anemone toxins. To get their meal, butterflyfish must get past these protective clownfish who, although smaller, are not intimidated. An anemone without its clownfish will quickly be eaten by butterflyfish. In return, the anemones provide the clownfish protection from their predators, who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> to anemone stings. As a further benefit to the anemone, waste ammonia from the clownfish feed symbiotic algae found in the anemone's tentacles.|$|E
25|$|Spiders do {{not usually}} adhere {{to their own}} webs, because {{they are able to}} spin both sticky and non-sticky types of silk, and are careful to travel across only non-sticky {{portions}} of the web. However, they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> to their own glue. Some of the strands of the web are sticky, and others are not. For example, if a spider has chosen to wait along the outer edges of its web, it may spin a non-sticky prey or signal line to the web hub to monitor web movement. However, in the course of spinning sticky strands, spiders have to touch these sticky strands. They do this without sticking by using careful movements, dense hairs and nonstick coatings on their feet to prevent adhesion.|$|E

25|$|Chickenpox is an {{airborne}} disease which spreads easily {{through the}} coughs and sneezes of an infected person. It may be spread {{from one to}} {{two days before the}} rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. It may also spread through contact with the blisters. Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> through contact with the blisters. The disease can usually be diagnosed based on the presenting symptom; however, in unusual cases it may be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the blister fluid or scabs. Testing for antibodies may be done to determine if a person is or is not immune. People usually only get chickenpox once. Although reinfections by the virus occur, these reinfections usually do not cause any symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Starr {{took the}} {{position}} part-time and remained active with his law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, {{as this was}} permitted by statute and was also the norm with previous independent counsel investigations. As time went on, however, Starr was increasingly criticized for alleged conflicts of interest stemming from his continuing association with Kirkland & Ellis. Kirkland, like several other major law firms, was representing clients in litigation with the government, including tobacco companies and auto manufacturers. The firm itself was being sued by the Resolution Trust Company, a government agency involved in the Whitewater matter. Additionally, Starr's own actions were challenged because Starr had, on one occasion, talked with lawyers for Paula Jones, who was suing Bill Clinton over an alleged sexual assault. Starr had explained to them why he believed that sitting U.S.presidents <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> to civil suit.|$|E
25|$|On November 14, 2006, Transport Minister Lawrence Cannon {{announced}} an immediate $37 million investment on improving security in public transit systems across the country. Cannon said that transit systems <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> to terrorist attacks {{like those that}} hit Madrid, London and Mumbai {{over the past two}} years. Toronto and Montreal received $11 million each, Ottawa $1.2 million while Vancouver, Edmonton and Calgary also received a certain amount. The money will be used for security plans, public awarenesses and training. The Toronto Transit Commission and OC Transpo requested that the money would be spent on installing cameras inside buses. Subsequently it was revealed that while 40% of all transit users in Canada use the TTC, and 85% of Toronto transit riders use the TTC, it will only receive $1.46 million, with the remaining grant used for GO Transit and Union Station.|$|E

25|$|Elderspeak can in fact {{contribute}} to decreased comprehension, and can increase confusion. Early social scientists first identified elderspeak and estimated that 20% {{of the communication}} occurring in nursing homes is actually elderspeak (Caporael, 1981). Caretakers of nursing home residents must be particularly careful when using elderspeak. Although elderspeak {{has been shown to}} help older adults with dementia and Alzheimerâ€™s in language comprehension, they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> to feeling disrespected when it is used. Resisting care is an ongoing problem with dementia patients, as well as violent behaviour, and residents of nursing homes are more likely to resist care when their nurse uses elderspeak. Care givers may assume that the elder prefers the nurturing of elderspeak but older adults think of it as demeaning. Older adults in both institutional settings and those receiving home care services report that as many as 40% of their caregivers use speech they perceive as demeaning, and 75% of the interactions that elderly people have are with the staff of the nursing homes.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{extensive}} damage in Newfoundland, the name Igor was retired {{in the spring}} of 2011 by request of the Meteorological Service of Canada, and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. [...] In Canada's report to the World Meteorological Organization, it was stated to be a storm without parallel in the island's history. [...] This was only the second time that the Meteorological Service of Canada had requested that a hurricane name be retired (the first was Hurricane Juan in 2003). [...] The hurricane is also considered a probable benchmark for future cyclones in the region, having illustrated to residents that they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> from hurricanes and their impacts. [...] The name was replaced by Ian and was first used during the 2016 season.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of Cyclone Alby, an appeal for relief in the {{affected}} region was made by The Lord Mayor's Distress Relief Fund. The unprecedented scale of damage prompted meteorologists to vastly improve forecasting {{in the region to}} be better prepared for a similar storm in the future. At the time, little to no warning was given to residents in the South-West Land Division; this was the result of Alby's abrupt acceleration along a cold front, a complex forecasting situation. It was also regarded as a [...] "wake up call" [...] for the region, reminding residents that they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> to the effects of tropical cyclones. Cyclone Alby {{has been used as a}} benchmark to compare future storms in the region to, such as Severe Tropical Cyclone Bianca in 2011.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the nature}} of its legal work, the ACLU is often {{involved}} in litigation against governmental bodies, which are generally protected from adverse monetary judgments; a town, state or federal agency may be required to change its laws or behave differently, but not to pay monetary damages except by an explicit statutory waiver. In some cases, the law permits plaintiffs who successfully sue government agencies to collect money damages or other monetary relief. In particular, the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976 leaves the government liable in some civil rights cases. Fee awards under this civil rights statute are considered [...] "equitable relief" [...] rather than damages, and government entities <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> from equitable relief. Under laws such as this, the ACLU and its state affiliates sometimes share in monetary judgments against government agencies. In 2006, the Public Expressions of Religion Protection Act sought to prevent monetary judgments in the particular case of violations of church-state separation.|$|E
