40|$|A matrix {{model is}} used to {{describe}} the dynamics of a population of female tsetse flies structured by parity (i. e., by the number of larvae laid). For typical parameter values, the intrinsic growth rate of the population is zero when the adult daily survival rate is 0. 970, corresponding to an adult life expectancy of 1 / 0. 030 = 33. 3 days. This value is plausible and consistent with results found earlier by others. The intrinsic growth rate is insensitive to the variance of the interlarval period. Temperature being a function of the time of the year, a known relationship between temperature and mean pupal and interlarval times was used to produce a time-varying version of the model which was fitted to temperature and (estimated) population data. With well-chosen parameter values, the modeled population replicated at least roughly the population data. This illustrates dynamically the <b>abiotic</b> <b>effect</b> of temperature on population growth. Given that tsetse flies are the vectors of trypanosomiasis ("sleeping sickness") the model provides a framework within which future transmission models can be developed in order to study the impact of altered temperatures on the spread of this deadly disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{monitoring}} arises when in an ecosystem, {{in particular in}} a system of several populations, observing some components, we want to recover the state of the whole system in function of time. Due to the difficulty to construct exactly this state process, we look for an auxiliary system called observer, the solution of which reproduces this process with certain approximation. This means, that the solution of the observer tends to that of the original system. For this work an important concept is observability which means, that from the observation it is possible to recover the state process in a unique way, however without determining a constructive method to obtain it. If observability holds for the original system, it guarantees the existence of an auxiliary matrix which makes it possible to construct an observer of the system. The considered system of populations is described by the classical Lotka-Volterra model with one predator and two preys and the construction of its observer is illustrated with a numerical example. Finally, it is shown how the observer can be used for the estimation of the level of an <b>abiotic</b> <b>effect</b> on the population system...|$|E

Methods and Results: The composts consisted of pruning wastes, with or without addition of coffee wastes (3 / 1 and 4 / 1, dry wt/dry wt) or urea (1000 / 1, dry wt/dry wt). In vitro experiments suggested the biopesticide effect of the composts against Fusarium oxysporum, while only the compost of pine bark and urea (1000 / 1 dry wt/dry wt) had an <b>abiotic</b> <b>effect.</b> Melon plant growth with composts and F. oxysporum was one to four times greater than in the non-amended soil, although there was no significant decrease in the level of the F. oxysporum in the soil. The addition of composts to the soil also improved its biological quality, as assessed by microbiological and biochemical parameters: ATP and hydrolases involved in the P (phosphatase), C (β-glucosidase) and N (urease) cycles. Conclusions: Green composts had greater beneficial characteristics, improved plant growth and controlled fusarium wilt in melon plants. These composts improve the soil quality of semi-arid agricultural soils. Significance and Impact of the Study: Biotic and abiotic factors from composts have been tested as responsible of their biopesticide activity against fusarium wilt. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Hence, we investigated stream invertebrate assemblages on Hokkaido Island, Japan, and assessed how the processes of determining regional patterns in species diversity differed among guilds (collector-filterers, collector-gatherers/shredders, scrapers, and predators) by taking both inter-guild and <b>abiotic</b> <b>effects</b> into consideration using Bayesian networks. Collector-gatherers/shredders, collector-filterers, and predators exhibited significant regional gradients in taxonomic richness. Gradients in the former two guilds can be generated by variation in flood disturbance regardless of interactions with other guilds. The gradient in predator taxonomic richness was indirectly related to the disturbance and was directly generated by bottom-up effects through their prey (collector-gatherers/shredders and collector-filterers). We found that not only environmental factors, but also inter-guild effects may be essential for forming the regional gradient in predators, unlike those for collector-gatherers/shredders and collector-filterers.

40|$|The {{monitoring}} {{and analysis of the}} processes taking place in an ecosystem is a key issue for a sustainable human activity. A system of populations, as the biotic component of a complex ecosystem is usually affected by the variation of its abiotic environment. Even in nearly natural ecosystems an <b>abiotic</b> <b>effect</b> like climatic implications of global warming may cause important changes in the dynamics of the population system. In ecosystems involving field cultivation or any industrial activity; the abiotic parameter in question may be the concentration of a substance, changing e. g. as a result of pollution, application of a pesticide, or a fertilizer, etc. In many cases the observation of the densities of each population may be technically complicated or expensive, therefore the question arises whether from the observation of the densities of certain (indicator) populations, the whole state process of the population system can be uniquely recovered. The paper is aimed at a methodological development of the state monitoring, under the conditions of a changing environment. It is shown, how the technique of mathematical systems theory can be applied not only for the approximate calculation of the state process {{on the basis of the}} observed data, even under the effect of an exogene abiotic change with known dynamics; but in certain cases, also for the estimation of the unknown biological effect of the change of an abiotic parameter.

For this reason {{the aim of the}} paper was to analyze its <b>abiotic</b> <b>effect</b> on common bean cultivation in a Red Ferralitic soil. A sowing of twelve varieties was performed in non-optimum season (high heat environment) during three years: 2013, 2014 and 2015 through an alpha-Latin design using three replicates per accession. The number of germinated plants was measured within the first 11 days after sowing to obtain the survival percentage. In the same way absolute (AGR) and relative (RGR) growth rate between 21 and 30 days and the plant height from 20 to 70 days with measurement ranges of 10 and 15 days were also evaluated and plotted by a logistic model. The values of daily mean temperature (DMT) were registered to calculate the accumulative temperature during the germination and growth phases. For the statistical evaluation, AGR and RGR were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and a Tukey comparison where significance was defined with a probability level of P< 0. 05. The results showed that plant survival percentage was significantly affected by increasing temperature following a sigmoid model, where differences among varieties were observed, while a prediction of survival behavior was also carried out for extreme values of temperature. The model corroborated that DMT above 28 C decreases the survival percentage until values less than 30 %. On the other hand the most sensible varieties in the germination stage showed a higher relative growth rate which contributes for understanding the physiological effect of thermal stress in common bean plants.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the last century, many studies have reported evidence describing the effects of organic inputs on soil aggregate stability. In 1965, Monnier proposed a conceptual model that considers different patterns of temporal effects on aggregate stability depending {{on the nature of the}} organic inputs: easily decomposable products have an intense and transient effect on aggregate stability while more recalcitrant products have a lower but longer term effect. We confronted this conceptual model with a literature review of experimental data from laboratory and field experiments. This literature analysis validated the conceptual model proposed by Monnier and pointed out gaps in our current knowledge concerning the relationships between aggregate stability and organic inputs. Noticeably, the experimental dataset confirmed the biological and temporal effects of organic inputs on aggregate stability as proposed in the model. Monnier’s model also related the evolution of aggregate stability to different microbial decomposing agents, but this relationship was not made clear in this literature analysis. No direct or universal relationship was found between the aggregative factors induced by organic input decomposition (binding molecules or decomposers of biomass) and temporal aggregate stability dynamics. This suggests the existence of even more complex relationships. The model can be improved by considering (i) the direct <b>abiotic</b> <b>effect</b> of some organic products immediately after the inputs, (ii) the initial biochemical characteristics of the organic products and (iii) the effects of organic products on the various mechanisms of aggregate breakdown. For now, no trend is evident in the effect of the rate of organic inputs or the effect of the soil characteristics (essentially carbon and clay contents) on aggregate stability...|$|E

Taking biotic and abiotic factors, we constructed several predicting models, which were meaningful and were the first attempt (to authors’ knowledge). In contrast to model 2, model 1 and 3 could not predict sphalerite bioleaching. It suggested that ferric ions and pH occupied a vital position in sphalerite dissolution (Mousavi et al. 2008). In addition, although OTU_ 1 and OTU_ 2 were dominant OTUs, the rare OTUs and their interaction between OTUs might also play important roles in bioleaching process (Lyons and Schwartz 2001; Lyons et al. 2005). Using these five parameters, the predicting model could be optimized and was efficiently connected the biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>effects</b> in bioleaching process. It suggested that the cooperation of biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>effects</b> was inseparable and significative (Sand et al. 2001). This predicting model might also be applied in other mineral bioleaching system after modified. That was, if the iron/sulfur concentration, pH value, temperature and microorganism had been obtained in a natural bioleaching system/mine, the potential metal recovery efficiency might be estimated, which was significative for mine selection in industry applications.|$|R

40|$|Summary 1.  Weather-related episodic {{events are}} {{typically}} unpredictable, and their duration is often short. Abiotic and biological responses are often missed in routine monitoring. These responses are, however, now of particular relevance given projected changes in extreme weather conditions. 2.  We present data from high-frequency monitoring stations from lakes in Europe, North America and Asia that illustrate {{two classes of}} <b>abiotic</b> <b>effects</b> of weather events: (i) generally short-lived effects of storms on lake thermal structure and (ii) the more prolonged effects of high rainfall events on dissolved organic matter levels and water clarity. We further relate these <b>abiotic</b> <b>effects</b> to changes in dissolved oxygen or in chlorophyll a levels. 3.  Three differing causes for weather-related decreases in surface dissolved oxygen levels were observed: (i) entrainment of anoxic water from depth, (ii) reduction in primary productivity and (iii) increased mineralisation of organic carbon delivered from the catchment. 4.  The duration of in-lake effects tended to be longer for events driven by weather conditions with a longer return period, that is, conditions that were relatively more severe and less frequent at a site. While the susceptibility of lakes to change was related {{in part to the}} severity of the meteorological drivers, the impacts also depended on site-specific factors in some cases. 5.  The availability of high-frequency data at these sites provided insight into the capacity of the lakes to absorb current and future pressures. Several of the changes we observed, including increases in carbon availability, decreases in photosynthetically active radiation and increased disturbance, have the capacity to shift lakes towards an increased degree of heterotrophy. The magnitude and direction of any such change will, however, also depend on the magnitude and direction of climate change for a given location and on lake and catchment characteristics.

The experiment was done on two adjacent rocky shores, one sheltered and one exposed, on a small tropical island. The effect of predation in maintaining bare space was greatest on the exposed shore/upper mid-intertidal, less on the sheltered shore and absent on the exposed shore/lower mid-intertidal. The barnacle, Tesseropora rosea, recruited heavily at the exposed shore/lower mid-intertidal and was dominant, but was unable to colonize the exposed shore/upper mid-intertidal or the sheltered shore. The barnacle, Tetraclita squamosa, successfully colonized only the exposed shore/upper mid-intertidal and did not appear to be affected by predation. The oyster, Saccostrea echinata, colonized only the sheltered shore and was very susceptible to predation.

Species diversity of each archipelago (γ) was additively partitioned into α, β, nestedness and replacement β-components to investigate the relative importance of environmental and spatial drivers.

Climate {{change will}} likely alter the {{distribution}} and abundance of northern mammals {{through a combination of}} direct, <b>abiotic</b> <b>effects</b> (e. g., changes in temperature and precipitation) and indirect, biotic effects (e. g., changes in the abundance of resources, competitors, and predators). Bioenergetic approaches are ideally suited to predicting the impacts of climate change because individual energy budgets integrate biotic and abiotic influences, and translate individual function into population and community outcomes. In this review, we illustrate how bioenergetics can be used to predict the regional biodiversity, species range limits, and community trophic organization of mammals under future climate scenarios. Although reliable prediction of climate change impacts for particular species requires better data and theory on the physio-logical ecology of northern mammals, two robust hypotheses emerge from the bioenergetic approaches presented here. First, the impacts of climate change in northern regions will be shaped by the appearance of new species {{at least as much as}} by the disappearance of current species.

Multi-factor experiments with combinations of stresses bridge this gap, increasing our understanding of the genotype-environment-phenotype functional map for the host plant and the affiliated epiphytic community. The maize inbred B 73 was exposed to single and combination abiotic and the biotic stress treatments: low nitrogen fertilizer and high levels of infection with southern leaf blight (causal agent Cochliobolus heterostrophus). Microbial epiphyte samples were collected at the vegetative early-season phase and species composition was determined using 16 S ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis. Plant traits and level of southern leaf blight disease were measured late-season. Bacterial diversity was different among stress treatment groups (P< 0. 001). Lower species richness—alpha diversity [...] was correlated with increased severity of southern leaf blight disease when disease pressure was high. Nitrogen fertilization intensified the decline in bacterial alpha diversity. While no single bacterial ribotype was consistently associated with disease severity, small sets of ribotypes were good predictors of disease levels. Difference in leaf bacterial-epiphyte diversity early in the season were correlated with plant disease severity, supporting further tests of microbial epiphyte-disease correlations for use in predicting disease progression...|$|R
40|$|The start, end, {{duration}} {{and intensity of}} the thermal growing season (the period with mean daily temperatures exceeding 5 °C) during the past century (1890 - 1995) was analysed at nine sites in the Nordic region. Statistical comparisons were made between three adjacent 35 -year periods. The {{results indicate that the}} growing season lengthened considerably at all sites between 1891 - 1925 and 1926 - 1960. Lengthening has continued at a slower rate up to the present at the eight Fennoscandian sites but not at the Icelandic site. In contrast, the intensity of the growing season, expressed by effective temperature sum above 5 °C, which increased at all sites between the first two periods, has decreased slightly at all locations except Turku in recent decades. Under three scenarios, representing the range of estimated greenhouse gas-induced warming by the 2050 s, the growing season is expected to lengthen at all sites. For a "Central" scenario, the greatest lengthening is computed for southern and western Scandinavia (7 - 8 weeks) with smaller changes in Finland (4 weeks) and Iceland (3 weeks). With a lengthening growing season during the past century in Fennoscandia, there are likely to have been impacts on natural and managed ecosystems. Some evidence of recent biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>effects</b> already exists, but other indicators of long-term change remain to be analysed. ...|$|R
40|$|The Chinese Terrestrial Ecosystem Flux Research Network (ChinaFLUX) is a {{long-term}} national network of micrometeorological flux measurement sites that measure the net exchange of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere. The ChinaFLUX network includes 8 observation sites (10 ecosystem types) and encompasses a large range of latitudes (21 degrees 57 'N to 44 degrees 30 'N), altitudes, climates and species. It relies on the existing Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN), fills an important regional gap and increases the number of ecosystem types in FLUXNET. Data and site information are available online at the ChinaFLUX web sites ([URL] Expanding {{the scope of the}} FLUXNET database, ChinaFLUX offers new opportunities to quantify and compare the magnitudes and dynamics of annual ecosystem carbon and water balance and to explore the biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>effects</b> on ecosystem processes of carbon dioxide and water vapor exchange that are unique to ecosystems in China, such as the vegetation communities on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. Besides, ChinaFLUX also provides more insights to help define the current status and enable future prediction of the global biogeochemical cycles of carbon, water and trace gases. Recent findings from the ChinaFLUX network are summarized in both micrometeorological and ecological aspects. This paper also summarizes these results and makes recommendations for the research priorities in ChinaFLUX. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Background Leaf out {{times of}} {{temperate}} forest trees are a prominent determinant of global carbon dynamics throughout the year. Abiotic cues of leaf emergence are well studied but {{investigation of the}} relative roles of shared evolutionary history (phylogeny) and local adaptation to climate in determining the species-level responses to these cues is needed to better apprehend the effect of global change on leaf emergence. We explored {{the relative importance of}} phylogeny and climate in determining the innate leaf out phenology across the temperate biome. Methods We used an extensive dataset of leaf-out dates of 1126 temperate woody species grown in eight Northern Hemisphere common gardens. For these species, information on the native climate and phylogenetic position was collected. Using linear regression analyses, we examine the relative effect of climate variables and phylogeny on leaf out variation among species. Results Climate variables explained twice as much variation in leaf out timing as phylogenetic information, a process that was driven primarily by the complex interactive effects of multiple climate variables. Although the primary climate factors explaining species-level variation in leaf-out timing varied drastically across different families, our analyses reveal that local adaptation plays a stronger role than common evolutionary history in determining tree phenology across the temperate biome. Conclusions In the long-term, the direct effects of physiological adaptation to <b>abiotic</b> <b>effects</b> of climate change on forest phenology are likely to outweigh the indirect effects mediated through changes in tree species composition...|$|R
