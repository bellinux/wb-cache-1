25|$|Heising (constant-current) modulation: RF {{amplifier}} plate voltage is {{fed through}} a “choke” (high-value inductor). The AM modulation tube plate is fed {{through the same}} inductor, so the modulator tube diverts current from the RF amplifier. The choke acts as a constant current source in the <b>audio</b> <b>range.</b> This system has a low power efficiency.|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{reproduction}} of audio signals, the signal components of a selected <b>audio</b> frequency <b>range</b> (1) of an audio signal are concentrated in a narrower <b>audio</b> frequency <b>range</b> (II). This is achieved by detecting first signal components in the first <b>audio</b> frequency <b>range</b> (I), generating second signal components in the second <b>audio</b> frequency <b>range</b> (II), and controlling the amplitude of the second signal components {{in response to the}} amplitude of the first signal components. As a result, dedicated transducers may be used which are particularly efficient in the narrower frequency range. The original frequency range (I) may contain the lower frequency signal components (bass components) of the audio signal...|$|R

5000|$|Initially, {{satellite}} subcarrier audio was tuned using commercial receivers or consumer-grade TVRO [...] "big dish" [...] satellite receivers. The <b>audio</b> <b>ranged</b> {{in frequency}} from 5.0 to 8.5 MHz for both {{left and right}} audio channels. Fine tuning options included monaural and discrete stereo tuning with three bandwidth modes: narrow (130 kHz), normal (280 kHz) and wide (500 kHz).|$|R
25|$|This {{design is}} simple, {{but a good}} basis for a {{practical}} design because it automatically stabilises its operating point, since feedback internally operates from DC up through the <b>audio</b> <b>range</b> and beyond. Further circuit elements would probably {{be found in a}} real design that would roll-off the frequency response above the needed range to prevent the possibility of unwanted oscillation. Also, the use of fixed diode bias as shown here can cause problems if the diodes are not both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors if the output transistors turn on too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage.|$|E
2500|$|Beat {{frequency}} oscillator (BFO) - This is an electronic oscillator {{which is only}} found in communications receivers, used in the reception of radiotelegraph (CW) or single-sideband modulation (SSB). [...] It produces a fixed frequency offset from the IF which is mixed with the IF in the demodulator. [...] The IF and BFO frequencies produce a heterodyne (beat) in the <b>audio</b> <b>range</b> which sounds like a musical tone in the speaker. [...] In CW the [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] of the Morse code are audible as beeps.|$|E
