5|$|Roughly spherical eggs of {{different}} animals {{give rise to}} extremely different bodies, from jellyfish to lobsters, butterflies to elephants. Many of these organisms share the same structural genes for bodybuilding proteins like collagen and enzymes, but biologists had expected that each group of animals would have its own rules of development. The surprise of evo-devo is that the shaping of bodies is controlled by a rather small percentage of genes, and that these regulatory genes are ancient, shared by all animals. The giraffe {{does not have a}} gene for a long neck, <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> elephant has a gene for a big body. Their bodies are patterned by a system of switching which causes development {{of different}} features to begin earlier or later, to occur in this or that part of the embryo, and to continue for more or less time.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} a {{crossing}} {{since at least the}} 17th century at this location, where the road meets the River Irwell. A bridge was constructed over the river around 1677–79, replacing an earlier ford. It was the first river crossing east of Warrington. This bridge was demolished in 1745 in order to stop the progress of the Jacobite army and was replaced by a wooden footbridge, and subsequently a three-arch road bridge. These bridges pre-dated the Barton Aqueduct, and a condition of the aqueduct's design was that it did not impede progress on the Irwell <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> existing bridge.|$|E
25|$|Research on {{alcoholism}} within families has leaned towards exploring {{issues that}} are wrong in the community rather than potential strengths or positives. When researchers conduct research that helps communities, it can be easier for community members {{to identify with the}} positives and work towards a path of resilience. Flawed research design in adult children of alcoholics (ACOA) research showed ACOAs were psychologically damaged. Some flawed research designs include using ACOAs as part of the control group and comparing them to other ACOAs within the same study. This may have caused some limitations in the study that were not listed. When comparing ACOAs to other ACOAs, it is difficult to interpret accurate results that show certain behaviors in the group studied. Research that has been conducted more recently has used control groups with non-ACOAs to see whether the behaviors align with prior research. This research has shown that behaviors were similar between non-ACOAs and ACOAs. An 18 year-long study compared children of alcoholics (COA) to other COAs. In failing to use non-COAs as controls, we miss an opportunity to see if the negative aspects of a person are related to having an alcoholic parent, or are they just simply a fact of life. For example, in Werner’s study, he found that 30% of COAs were committing serious delinquencies. This data would have been more usable if they had viewed the percentage of those committing crimes when compared to non-ACOAs. In a study conducted in a midwestern university, researchers found that {{there was no significant difference}} between ACOA and non-ACOA students. One of the main differences was the student’s views on how they connect their past experiences with their current social-emotional functioning. Students who were ACOAs did not demonstrate issues with their perspective on their interpersonal issues <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> non-ACA students. However, this study did show that there were other underlying problems in the family structure that may attribute to the perception of not being well adjusted in life.|$|E

500|$|The Parliamentary {{leader of}} the {{opposition}} Labour party, Harold Wilson, attacked the new Prime Minister as [...] "an elegant anachronism". He asserted that nobody from Douglas-Home's background knew of the problems of ordinary families.

After half a century of democratic advance, of social revolution, the whole process has ground to a halt with a fourteenth earl!" [...] Douglas-Home pooh-poohed this as inverted snobbery, and observed, [...] "I suppose Mr Wilson, when you come to think of it, is the fourteenth Mr Wilson." [...] He called Wilson [...] "this slick salesman of synthetic science" [...] and the Labour party [...] "the only relic of class consciousness in the country".

500|$|Although {{the duke}} had seen navigable aqueducts in use on canals when {{travelling}} abroad on his Grand Tour, {{the idea of}} an such a structure carrying a canal over a river was new to England and was ridiculed by contemporary engineers. One brought in to review the plans, at Brindley's request, commented in a report to the Duke of Bridgewater that [...] "I have often heard of castles in the air, but never before saw where one was to be erected." [...] The necessary Act of Parliament was passed in March 1760, and was quite specific about the form the aqueduct had to take, to protect the viability of the Mersey & Irwell Navigation below. There was already a three-arch road bridge, Barton Bridge, passing over the Irwell, and the aqueduct was required not to restrict traffic on the river <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> road bridge already did. It had to have the same number of arches, the foundations for which had to be fixed in the river bed, and the arches had to be at least as wide and high as those of the road bridge.|$|E

Samuell High School who, in 1966, were stopped at the school's front door and ordered to cut their hair {{in order to be}} admitted to the school. The young men filed a lawsuit against the Dallas Independent School District, claiming the restriction interfered with their constitutional freedom of expression. Despite not knowing the boys involved, Marcus stepped forward to champion their case before the public, taking out a newspaper ad defending the choice as a simple fashion decision rather than rebellion against authority. Additionally, he offered legal support if needed, noting in a telegram to school board president Lee McShan, Jr., [...] "I don’t like long hair <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> principal does, but I will fight for the rights of those students to wear hair any way they choose." [...] Though the case was lost and appealed {{all the way to the}} U.S. Supreme Court without success, decades letter the men still appreciated Marcus' support.

Geoffrey of Monmouth's pseudo-genealogy traced a Trojan origin for royal Briton descents in Historia Regum Britanniae.

However, even before the so-called Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century these supposed facts of the medieval concept of history were doubted by Blaise Pascal: [...] "Homer wrote a romance, for nobody supposes that Troy and Agamemnon existed <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> apples of the Hesperides.
