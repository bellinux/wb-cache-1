The model is applied to analyze the dynamic behaviour of the modal coupling between two degenerate resonances of the same cavity. In particular, this can be used {{to describe the}} coupling of counter propagating whispering gallery modes (WGMs) by Rayleigh scattering. The theory is successfully compared to experiments carried out in silica microspheres. These results show that this ringdown technique can be extended to accurately measure linear properties and frequency splittings of high-quality factor WGM micro-resonators...|$|E
40|$|In {{magnetic}} fields applied {{parallel to the}} anisotropy axis, the magnetization of Mn_ 12 has been measured {{in response to a}} field that is swept back and forth <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>resonances</b> corresponding to steps N= 4, 5, [...] . 9. The fraction of molecules remaining in the metastable well after each sweep through the resonance is inconsistent with expectations for an ensemble of identical molecules. The data are consistent instead with the presence of a broad distribution of tunnel splittings. A very good fit is obtained for a Gaussian distribution of the second-order anisotropy tunneling parameter X_E=-(| E|/ 2 D). We show that dipolar shuffling is a negligible effect which cannot explain our data. Comment: minor corrections (PACS nos, signs in Fig. 2...|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the research and development activities of the SPES project regarding the optimization of the radioactive beam production, a dedicated experimental study has been recently started in order to investigate the possibility of in-source ionization of germanium using a set of tunable dye lasers. Germanium is one of the beams to be accelerated by the SPES ISOL facility, which is under construction at Legnaro INFN Laboratories. The three-step, two color ionization schemes have been tested using a Ge hollow cathode lamp. The slow and the fast optogalvanic signals were detected and averaged by an oscilloscope as a proof of the laser ionization inside the lamp. As a result, several wavelength scans <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>resonances</b> of ionization schemes were collected with the fast optogalvanic signal. Some comparisons of ionization e ffi ciency for di ff erent ionization schemes were made. Furthermore, saturation curves of the first excitation transitions have been obtained.

40|$|We {{consider}} tunneling of spinless electrons from a single-channel emitter into {{an empty}} collector through an interacting resonant level of the quantum dot. When all Coulomb screening of sudden charge variations of the dot during the tunneling is realized by the emitter channel, the system is described with an exactly solvable model of a dissipative qubit. To study manifestations of the coherent qubit dynamics in the collector ac response we derive {{a solution to the}} corresponding Bloch equation for the model quantum evolution {{in the presence of the}} oscillating voltage of frequency ω and calculate perturbatively the ac response in the voltage amplitude. We have shown that in a wide range of the model parameters the coherent qubit dynamics results in the nonzero frequencies resonances in the amplitudes dependence of the ac harmonics and in the jumps of the harmonics phase shifts <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>resonances.</b> In the first order the ac response is directly related to the spectral decomposition of the corresponding transient current and contains only the first ω harmonic, whose amplitude exhibits resonance at ω=ωI, where ωI is the qubit oscillation frequency. In the second order we have obtained the 2 ω harmonic of the ac response with resonances in the frequency dependence of its amplitude at ωI,ωI/ 2 and zero frequency and also have found the frequency dependent shift of the average steady current...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{application}} of specifically shaped noise covers {{a variety of}} important investigations in accelerator physics, such as beam transfer measurements [4], sensitive measurements of longitudinal beam aperture, controlled beam heating for electron cooling [5] {{as well as for}} ultra slow extraction (USE) [6]. The idea behind USE is to move <b>the</b> beam <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>resonance</b> by a diffusion process. Firstly, precisely shaped narrow band noise centred on a harmonic of the revolution frequency will be used to transform the initially Gaussian-like distributed beam into a rectangularly shaped distribution. Secondly, to drive the beam towards <b>the</b> <b>resonance,</b> band limited noise, permanently covering <b>the</b> extraction <b>resonance,</b> will be slowly moved <b>across</b> <b>the</b> previously shaped beam distribution.
