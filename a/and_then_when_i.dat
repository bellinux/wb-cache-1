She later said that she accepted director Stephen Sommers' offer for the role without having read the actual script. [...] "I'd heard from other people that the script was quite good. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> finally got to read it myself... I really, really liked it... I liked {{that there were two}} kick-ass female roles. And I liked the fact that it wasn't just a big action movie... And there was comedy in it. I was genuinely really happily surprised when I read the script." [...] She put on approximately [...] of muscle for the role and trained in mixed martial arts with co-star Sienna Miller for some of the film's action sequences. Nichols was burned by a flame during the filming of a fight scene with Miller. Like The Amityville Horror, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra was not well received by most critics, but performed well at the box office. Richard Corliss of Time wrote that Nichols had [...] "an appealing manner and comely biceps" [...] as Scarlett O'Hara and took notice of her [...] "savory girl fight with Sienna Miller, as the mostly villainous Baroness." [...] After G.I. Joe, Nichols' next project was the horror film For Sale by Owner, where she played Anna Farrier. Going straight-to-video on October 27, 2009, the movie went largely unnoticed by critics and audiences alike.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Dave Fanning for RTÉ's Planet Rock Profiles before the Foo Fighters' appearance at the 1996 Féile Festival, Dave Grohl said of Zen Arcade, [...] "That album was amazing. I mean, Black Flag was early on, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> discovered Zen Arcade I thought, God, these people write songs, man. It's amazing. It's like the Byrds meets Black Flag, and it just blew me away, and the songs just stuck in your head forever {{and they were just}} amazing. Was that album, Zen Arcade, was recorded...I think it was recorded just straight, and I think they all took acid and recorded it in 48 hours. They did the whole album. That is what I had heard. And, to me, I was just like, God, these people are genius, you know? This is...this is amazing." ...|$|E
2500|$|He also {{performed}} in the 2007 WOMAD (World of Music, Arts and Dance) festival concert, and in reviewing his performance BBC Radio referred to his voice as [...] "sensational". D'Or described an experience that he had singing at the festival as follows: [...] "I had a concert in the Canary Islands...in the WOMAD Festival in front of something like 20,000 people, and then I saw {{just in front of}} me, a group of Palestinian young people with a huge Palestinian flag. And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. I closed my eyes and said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> opened my eyes and I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before. I don't know why this world...is choosing...always...war and hate, because things are much easier to solve if you just want to solve them, that's what I feel. And maybe it's naïve, but this is my belief." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, think!" [...] {{they all}} {{together}} cried laughingly; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> instantly <b>when</b> <b>I</b> cast my eyes down {{there was a}} perfect stillness {{as if they were}} all holding their breath and watching me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Left, left," [...] says he; [...] "keep to {{your left}} hand, mate Jim! Under the trees with you! Theer's where I killed my first goat. They don't come down here now; they're all mast-headed on them {{mountings}} for the fear of Benjamin Gunn. Ah! and there's the cetemery"--cemetery, he must have meant. [...] "You see the mounds? I come here and prayed, nows <b>and</b> <b>thens,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo. It weren't quite a chapel, but it seemed more solemn like; <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> says you, Ben Gunn was short-handed--no chapling, nor {{so much as a}} Bible and a flag you says." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{blame you}} one bit, Roger," [...] she said, frankly. [...] "When you went away, {{we thought we}} cared for each other; but of course we were only boy <b>and</b> girl <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> grew up and you did not come home, {{and it seemed that}} you never would come home, as you say, I fell in love with someone else.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{was feeling}} {{particularly}} safe and complacent, disaster came.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, that's it," [...] Bruno assented. [...] "Sylvie {{tells me}} the words, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> jump about, they get shooken up in my head-- till they're all froth!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor am I," [...] he {{continued}} very gently, [...] "the {{least in the}} world. Think of it, {{and you will find}} that <b>I</b> am right; <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> next <b>I</b> come, <b>then,</b> perhaps, you will not refuse to kiss me." [...] And so he went.|$|R
60|$|As I rode on {{the pines}} became slowly more {{numerous}} <b>and</b> loftier. <b>Then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had surmounted what I {{took to be}} the first foot-hill, I came upon a magnificent forest. A little farther on the trail walled me in with great seamed trunks, six feet in diameter, rising a hundred feet before spreading a single branch.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gentlemen of Rock River, when, in {{the course}} of human events, rumor had blow'd to my ears the history of the checker-playing of Rock River, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had waxed Cerro Gordo, and Claiborne, <b>and</b> Mower, <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> say to my ears was borne the clash of resounding arms in Rock River, the emporium of Rock County, then did I yearn for more worlds to conquer, and behold, I buckled on my armor and I am here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You didn't lose much: I {{was not a}} good actress; {{though now}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> liked my part I did pretty well they said," [...] {{answered}} Christie, modestly.|$|E
6000|$|Dane smiled curiously. [...] "Then I {{think it}} is enough for me, and you will {{overlook}} my presumption. Courthorne, I wonder now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> shall altogether understand you!" ...|$|E
60|$|Now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{could gain}} a week's leave of absence, I {{returned}} to the village, and was received with tolerable politeness by my uncle, and with a warmer feeling by his daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, unless {{some special}} {{business}} detains me, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> I'll wire <b>when</b> <b>I</b> can come," [...] was the reply, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the train rolled off, Dunston Porter {{standing at the}} end, waving {{the boys and girls}} adieu.|$|R

6000|$|... 2. Sometimes, when after sin committed, I {{have looked}} for sore chastisement from {{the hand of}} God, the very next that I have had from Him, hath been the {{discovery}} of His grace. Sometimes <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have been comforted, I have called myself a fool for my so sinking under trouble. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> again, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have been cast down, I thought I was not wise, to give such way to comfort; with such strength and weight have both these been upon me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Silly boy! Silly boy!" [...] said she, {{with her}} {{forefinger}} up; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> tried to lay {{hands on her}} again, she gave a little dainty curtsy, and was off into the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you met the Miss Merril Jimmy mentioned?" [...] she asked. [...] "I almost fancy she is {{the girl}} I used to see now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was in Toronto. What is she like?" ...|$|E

5000|$|He didn't think I {{could beat}} him, {{and that made}} me mad. I had to get mad to win.

[...] "In summer I {{sometimes}} put my nest just a {{few inches}} under ground, but often I hide it under a piece of bark or in a thick clump of grass, just as Danny Meadow Mouse often does his. In the fall I dig a deep burrow, deep enough to be {{beyond the reach of}} Jack Frost, and in a nice little bedroom down there I sleep the winter away. I have little storerooms down there too, in which I put seeds, berries <b>and</b> nuts. <b>Then</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> do wake up I have plenty to eat." ...|$|R

5000|$|He {{explained}} his stage name {{in an interview}} with ThisIsRnB: [...] "Earl St.Clair came from the irony from the fact that where I started producing in Cleveland, the street I was working on was St. Clair.

6000|$|Killy laughed. It was {{a shrill}} laugh. [...] "I should say not," [...] said he. [...] "I eat spiders and worms {{and all sorts}} of insects big enough to give a fellow a decent bite.
