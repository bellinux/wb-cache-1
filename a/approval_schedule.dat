40|$|Background: Rescue {{strategies}} like {{changes in}} tilt of table {{are used to}} {{raise the level of}} an inadequate sensory block following intrathecal injection. Epidural volume extension (EVE) refers to an injection of normal saline through epidural catheter following an intrathecal block. It results in a rapid increase in the sensory level of subarachnoid block. Thus, it has been postulated that EVE may be used as a rescue strategy for an inadequate post-spinal sensory block. However, the minimum effective volume (MEV) of normal saline for EVE induced increase in level of spinal block has not been researched till date. We proposed to determine the MEV of normal saline required for EVE induced increase in post-spinal block sensory level. Materials and Methods: This prospective sequential allocation study was conducted in consenting adult males after institutional ethical committee <b>approval</b> <b>scheduled</b> for lower limb surgery under combined spinal epidural (CSE) anesthesia, who had an inadequate level of sensory block. Herein, an inadequate level was defined as lower than T 10 at 10 min after the intrathecal injection, with no ascent for two consecutive readings taken 2 min apart. The EVE was performed with normal saline injected through epidural catheter, and was considered successful if the level of sensory block increased by two or more dermatomal segments within 5 min of the injection. The volume of normal saline for EVE was decided by using the up-and-down method, with the first patient receiving 10 mL and a dosing interval of 1 mL in subsequent patients. The analysis was done using the formula of Dixon and Massey, which enabled calculation of the MEV with 95 % CI. Quantitative parametric data is represented as mean ± SD and nonparametric data as median (range). Results and Conclusion: The MEV of normal saline to raise the level of sensory block by two or more dermatomal segments within 5 min of EVE is 7. 4 mL (95 % CI: 5. 5 - 9. 9 mL) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Brazilian {{power grid}} has {{traditionally}} been designed and operated using a set of deterministic reliability criteria. They have {{played an important role}} in the design and opera-tion of the Brazilian bulk power system for decades. However, they tend to use available resources less optimally and over-book facilities in the context of transmissions capacity. With regard to the <b>approval</b> of <b>scheduled</b> maintenance of transmission equipment on the basic grid, the main deterministic criterion adopted by the Brazilian Independent System Operator (ISO) is the n 2 2 criterion. The current article proposes replacement of the deterministic n 2 2 cri-terion by a probabilistic criterion to allow for more scheduled maintenance during medium load workdays, without significantly increasing the risk level of the system. The expected result of implementing our recommended criterion is a reduction in operations and maintenance costs, which should in turn reduce the electricity rates paid by end users...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the process and}} results of a demonstration of solid-state lighting (SSL) technology conducted in 2009 at the recently reconstructed I- 35 W bridge in Minneapolis, MN. The project was supported under the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Solid-State Lighting GATEWAY Technology Demonstration Program. Other participants in the demonstration project included the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT), Federal Highways Administration (FHWA), and BetaLED™ (a division of Ruud Lighting). Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) conducted the measurements {{and analysis of the}} results. DOE has implemented a three-year evaluation of the LED luminaires in this installation in order to develop new longitudinal field data on LED performance in a challenging, real-world environment. This document provides information through the initial phase of the I- 35 W bridge project, up to and including the opening of the bridge to the public and the initial feedback received on the LED lighting installation from bridge users. Initial findings of the evaluation are favorable, with minimum energy savings level of 13 % for the LED installation relative to the simulated base case using 250 W high-pressure sodium (HPS) fixtures. The LEDs had an average illuminance level of 0. 91 foot candles compared to 1. 29 fc for the HPS lamps. The LED luminaires cost $ 38, 000 more than HPS lamps, yielding a lengthy payback period, however the bridge contractor had offered to include the LED luminaires as part of the construction package at no additional cost. One potentially significant benefit of the LEDs in this installation is avoiding rolling lane closures on the heavily-traveled interstate bridge for the purpose of relamping the HPS fixtures. Rolling lane closures involve multiple crew members and various maintenance and safety vehicles, diversion of traffic, as well as related administrative tasks (e. g., <b>approvals,</b> <b>scheduling,</b> etc.). Mn/DOT records show an average cost of relamping fixtures along interstate roadways of between $ 130 - 150 per pole. The previous bridge saw a lamp mortality rate of approximately 50 % every two years, though the new bridge was designed to minimize many of the vibration issues. A voluntary Web-based feedback survey of nearly 500 self-described bridge users showed strong preference for the LED lighting - positive comments outnumbered negative ones by about five-to-one...|$|R

Treasury's request stated that "due to the sensitive nature of the operations, these positions require a unique blend of special characteristics, skills and abilities that cannot be announced to the general public, and for which it is not practical to examine. " According to OPM officials, no detailed criteria are applied when OPM considers such requests. OPM approved the request primarily because Treasury argued that the positions were sensitive in nature, involved law enforcement activities, and were impracticable to advertise and examine for. In using the Schedule A authority between September 1998 and January 2001, Customs made nine appointments to various positions. GAO found that circumstances surrounding five of the nine appointments can give the appearance of inconsistency in the application of the Schedule A appointment authority or possible favoritism toward former political employees. OPM reviews agencies' use of appointment authorities, including Schedule A and other excepted appointments, every four to five years. The most recent review of Customs was for appointments made in 1999.
