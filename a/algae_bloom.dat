5|$|Cabo Blanco, in the Atlantic Ocean, is {{the largest}} {{surviving}} single population of the species, and the only remaining site that still seems to preserve a colony structure. In the summer of 1997, a disease killed more than 200 animals (two-thirds of its population) within two months, extremely compromising the species' viable population. While opinions on the precise causes of this epidemic remain divided, the most likely cause is a morbilivirus or a toxic <b>algae</b> <b>bloom.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the storm's passage, the Long Island Lighting Company used 165workers {{to restore}} the power outages on Long Island. In Connecticut, state {{officials}} deployed about 200trucks to remove debris on roads. The Massachusetts National Guard was activated to assist in relief efforts. In Rhode Island, a man was killed while repairing damage caused by Bob. Beaches in the state re-opened by {{five days after the}} storm. The hurricane mixed the waters in Long Island Sound and prevented the <b>algae</b> <b>bloom</b> that happened in previous summers. In the days after Bob, the Commonwealth Electric Company brought electricians from outside the company and put their own workers on 16‑hour shifts to restore power across Massachusetts. Most Massachusetts residents, excluding those living on Cape Cod, had their power restored within five days. The hurricane struck {{toward the end of the}} summer, which significantly impacted the tourism season already in the midst of a recession. The New England coast was affected by a powerful nor'easter known as the Perfect Storm about two months after the hurricane struck the region. Some locations experienced worse damage from the October storm than from Bob.|$|E

2500|$|In a saltwater/reef aquarium, color {{temperature}} {{is an essential}} part of tank health. [...] Within about 400 to 3000 nanometers, light of shorter wavelength can penetrate deeper into water than longer wavelengths, providing essential energy sources to the algae hosted in (and sustaining) coral. This is equivalent to an increase of {{color temperature}} with water depth in this spectral range. Because coral typically live in shallow water and receive intense, direct tropical sunlight, the focus was once on simulating this situation with 6500K lights. In the meantime higher temperature light sources have become more popular, first with 10000K and more recently 16000K and 20000K. [...] Actinic lighting at the violet end of the visible range (420–460nm) is used to allow night viewing without increasing <b>algae</b> <b>bloom</b> or enhancing photosynthesis, and to make the somewhat fluorescent colors of many corals and fish [...] "pop", creating brighter display tanks.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{fertilizer}} and organic waste that urban runoff often carries, eutrophication often occurs in waterways {{affected by this}} type of runoff. After heavy rains, organic matter in the waterway is relatively high compared with natural levels, spurring growth of <b>algae</b> <b>blooms</b> that soon consume most of the oxygen. Once the naturally occurring oxygen in the water is depleted, the <b>algae</b> <b>blooms</b> die, and their decomposition causes further eutrophication. <b>Algae</b> <b>blooms</b> mostly occur in areas with still water, such as stream pools and the pools behind dams, weirs, and some drop structures. Eutrophication usually comes with deadly consequences for fish and other aquatic organisms.|$|R

500|$|Although Harveys Lake's waters were {{described}} as having [...] "great purity" [...] in 1893, the lake has experienced nutrient pollution, especially from phosphorus {{since at least the}} mid-20th century. <b>Algae</b> <b>blooms</b> occurred on the lake and caused a reduction in water quality throughout {{the latter half of the}} 20th century. A sewage system was installed in the borough of Harveys Lake in the summer of 1976, but this did not completely stop the <b>algae</b> <b>blooms.</b> However, the phosphorus load in the lake has been reduced by 29 percent. The lake was identified as impaired in 1994, with the cause of the impairment being large <b>algae</b> <b>blooms</b> and sedimentation in some areas. It is an anoxic lake.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} with the bay is eutrophication. This {{is the result of}} excessive fertilizer runoff from farms which contains nitrogen. When the nitrogen is washed off into streams it makes its way to the bay, where it causes <b>algae</b> <b>blooms.</b> <b>Algae</b> <b>blooms</b> occur when excessive nutrients are used by algae to grow quickly and as a result, cover large areas of the surface of the water. This in turn blocks sunlight from reaching submerged aquatic vegetation, which will die as a result. Eventually the <b>algae</b> <b>blooms</b> will also die, {{and as a result of}} the decomposition that takes place, all the oxygen is used up in the area. The resulting effect is a dead zone, where dissolved oxygen content is so low that no wildlife can live in the area.|$|R

Blue-green <b>algae</b> <b>blooms,</b> although not always toxic, is a repeated issue for residents and visitors of Upper Rideau Lake.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>algae</b> <b>bloom</b> is the {{appearance}} of a large amount of algae or scum floating on the surface of a body of water. Algae blooms are a natural occurrence in nutrient-rich lakes and rivers, though sometimes increased nutrient levels leading to algae blooms are due to fertilizer or animal waste runoff. A few species of algae produce toxins, but most fish kills due to <b>algae</b> <b>bloom</b> are a result of decreased oxygen levels. When the algae die, decomposition uses oxygen in the water that would be available to fish. A fish kill in a lake in Estonia in 2002 was attributed to a combination of <b>algae</b> <b>bloom</b> and high temperatures. [...] When people manage algae blooms in fish ponds, it is recommended that treatments be staggered to avoid too much algae dying at once, which may result in a large drop in oxygen content.|$|E
