50|$|The {{hispid hare}} (Caprolagus hispidus), also called <b>Assam</b> <b>rabbit,</b> is a leporid native to South Asia, whose {{historic}} range extended {{along the southern}} foothills of the Himalayas. Today, the habitat of the hispid hare is highly fragmented with an area of occupancy of less than 500 km2 extending over an estimated area of 5000 to 20000 km2. Populations experience a continuing decline in suitable habitat due to increasing agriculture, flood control, and human development. It is therefore listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1986.|$|E
