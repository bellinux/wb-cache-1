5|$|Six {{months after}} the alien {{substance}} Terrigen was released into the ecosystem, Joey Gutierrez developed metal-melting abilities. Unable to control this power, Gutierrez is confronted in the streets by soldiers {{who are willing to}} use lethal force to detain him. Gutierrez is saved by S.H.I.E.L.D., and Inhuman agent Daisy Johnson attempts to explain to him that he is also an Inhuman, with a dormant gene within him that was activated by the Terrigen. Struggling to help Gutierrez <b>accept</b> <b>what</b> has happened to him, Johnson seeks the help of Lincoln Campbell, the Inhuman who helped her transition but has now renounced the ways of the Inhumans, wishing to live a normal life.|$|E
5|$|Placzek became {{head of the}} {{theoretical}} physics division. Kowarski was designated {{to be the head}} of the experimental physics division, but there was a personality clash with Halban, and Kowarski did not wish to <b>accept</b> <b>what</b> he saw as a subordinate position under Halban. At this point, many other scientists said that they would not go without Kowarski, but Sir Edward Appleton, the permanent secretary of the British Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, of which the Tube Alloys was a part, managed to persuade them to go. Kowarski remained at Cambridge, where he worked for James Chadwick. Auger became head of the experimental physics division instead. Paneth became head of the chemistry division. Two other scientists that had escaped from France joined the laboratory: the French chemist Jules Guéron, who had been working for Free France at Cambridge, and Bruno Pontecorvo, an Italian scientist who had worked with Enrico Fermi in Italy before the war.|$|E
5|$|Will (Eric McCormack) feels {{neglected}} by his best friend, Grace (Debra Messing), as she {{spends a lot}} of time with her work. When Will calls Grace to confirm for a lunch date, Grace cannot go as she is too busy creating interior designs. Later, while doing his laundry, Will meets his new upstairs neighbor, Val (Molly Shannon). Immediately, the two take a liking to one another. The next day, Will visits Grace at work and introduces Val to her. After the two leave, Karen (Megan Mullally)—Grace's friend and socialite assistant—tells Grace that she did not like the way Will and Val acted towards one another. Grace, however, refuses to <b>accept</b> <b>what</b> Karen implies.|$|E

5|$|Simpson was {{determined}} {{to make an impact}} in the Tour de France; in his eighth year as a professional cyclist, he hoped for larger appearance fees in post-Tour criteriums to help secure his financial future after retirement. His plan was to finish in the top three, or to wear the yellow jersey {{at some point in the}} race. He targeted three key stages, one of which was the thirteenth, over Mont Ventoux, and planned to ride conservatively until the race reached the mountains. In the prologue, Simpson finished thirteenth. After the first week he was in sixth place overall, leading the favourites. As the race crossed the Alps, Simpson fell ill, across the Col du Galibier, with diarrhoea and stomach pains. Unable to eat, he finished stage ten in 16th place and dropped to seventh overall as his rivals passed him. Teammate Vin Denson advised Simpson to limit his losses and <b>accept</b> <b>what</b> he had. He placed in 39th position on stage 11 and 7th on 12. In Marseille, on the evening before stage thirteen, Simpson's manager, Daniel Dousset, pressured him for good results. Plaud begged Simpson to quit the race.|$|E
5|$|When the Southern states seceded {{from the}} Union and the American Civil War began, {{thousands}} of men in Ohio volunteered for service. Among them were McKinley and his cousin William McKinley Osbourne, who enlisted as privates in the newly formed Poland Guards in June 1861. The men left for Columbus where they were consolidated with other small units to form the 23rd Ohio Infantry. The men were unhappy to learn that, unlike Ohio's earlier volunteer regiments, {{they would not be}} permitted to elect their officers; they would be designated by Ohio's governor, William Dennison. Dennison appointed Colonel William Rosecrans as the commander of the regiment, and the men began training on the outskirts of Columbus. McKinley quickly took to the soldier's life and wrote a series of letters to his hometown newspaper extolling the army and the Union cause. Delays in issuance of uniforms and weapons again brought the men into conflict with their officers, but Major Rutherford B. Hayes convinced them to <b>accept</b> <b>what</b> the government had issued them; his style in dealing with the men impressed McKinley, beginning an association and friendship that would last until Hayes' death in 1893.|$|E

25|$|O'Leary {{was happy}} to <b>accept</b> <b>what</b> was called his dream job. Five days after being hired, however, O'Leary {{resigned}} from the position. It was later revealed that O'Leary had lied on his résumé about receiving a varsity letter and a Master's degree while in school. While O'Leary was criticized for lying, some in the media said that his resignation gave Notre Dame {{a chance to make}} a better decision. Two weeks after O'Leary resigned, Notre Dame signed Tyrone Willingham, the seventh-year coach of Stanford, to a six-year contract. Willingham became the school's first African American head coach in any sport. He immediately made changes to the Irish program, including changing the long used Irish offense from an option attack to a West Coast type. He also made his first-year Fighting Irish team only the second in Notre Dame history to pick captains on a game-by-game basis.|$|E
25|$|In August 1709 Eugene's chief {{political}} opponent and critic in Vienna, Prince Salm, retired as court chamberlain. Eugene and Wratislaw were now the undisputed {{leaders of the}} Austrian government: all major departments of state were in their hands or those of their political allies. However, another attempt at a negotiated settlement at Geertruidenberg in April 1710 failed, largely because the English Whigs still felt strong enough to refuse concessions, while Louis XIV saw little reason to <b>accept</b> <b>what</b> he had refused the previous year. Eugene and Marlborough could not be accused of wrecking the negotiations, but neither showed regret at {{the breakdown of the}} talks. There was no alternative but to continue the war, and in June the Allied commanders captured Douai. This success was followed by a series of minor sieges, and by the close of 1710 the Allies had cleared much of France's protective ring of fortresses. Yet there had been no final, decisive breakthrough, and this was to be the last year that Eugene and Marlborough would work together.|$|E
25|$|When Gaston {{arrived to}} the Pawn Shop, he aims {{at what he}} thought was Gold but discovers a {{mannequin}} instead. He is then confronted by Belle, who now knows he was willing to kill Rumple and believed he still had feelings for her, only to learn that the book was punishment and a constant reminder of why he died. He was also shocked to discover Belle is now Gold's wife, and leaves furious. Belle tells Gold and made him promise not to hurt Gaston, but when she tells Gold about what Hades told her he just couldn't <b>accept</b> <b>what</b> Belle wanted. At the docks, Gold uses magic to choke Gaston by the throat, ready to send him to the River of Lost Souls, when Belle pulls the dagger and commands him not to hurt Gaston, and he drops Gaston on the ground. However, Gaston is unable to let his vendetta against Gold go, and when he goes for his arrow, Belle accidentally knockes Gaston out into the River of Lost Souls. Unfortunately, Belle discovers that because she saved Gold but interfered, Hades arrives to tell the couple that the contract allowing him to take their baby was still in effect, as Belle was the one who knocked Gaston into the Acheron, not Gold. He then looks at a withering daisy flower that he picks up, as a sign of hope fading away. The burned flower later shows up at Granny's Diner, as a gift to Zelena from Hades.|$|E

500|$|While piecing {{together}} the final {{components of the}} album, the band recorded a video for [...] "Warped". They asked Flea's brother-in-law, Gavin Bowden, to direct it. The video involved Kiedis and Navarro kissing towards the end {{as a way of}} breaking the monotony of cumbersome video recording. Thinking nothing of it, they continued to shoot and finished several days later. Warner Bros., however, saw the video and instantly wanted it thrown away, considering it to be unmarketable and that the kiss would alienate {{a large portion of the}} band's fan base. The band came to a consensus to let the kiss remain on the final cut, prompting a backlash from the college segment of their audience, who took offense at the action. Kiedis said of the situation: [...] "If they couldn't <b>accept</b> <b>what</b> we were doing, we didn't need them anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1902, Durkheim {{had finally}} {{achieved}} {{his goal of}} attaining a prominent position in Paris when he became the chair {{of education at the}} Sorbonne. Durkheim aimed for the Parisian position earlier, but the Parisian faculty took longer to <b>accept</b> <b>what</b> some called [...] "sociological imperialism" [...] and admit social science to their curriculum. He became a full professor (Professor of the Science of Education) there in 1906, and in 1913 he was named Chair in [...] "Education and Sociology". Because French universities are technically institutions for training secondary school teachers, this position gave Durkheim considerable influence—his lectures were the only ones that were mandatory for the entire student body. Durkheim had much influence over the new generation of teachers; around that time he also served as an advisor to the Ministry of Education. In 1912, he published his last major work, The Elementary Forms of The Religious Life.|$|E

Carolyn Collette, a literary critic who has studied Davison's writing, identifies the different motives ascribed to Davison, including [...] "uncontrolled impulses" [...] or a search for martyrdom for women's suffrage. Collette also sees a more current trend among historians [...] "to <b>accept</b> <b>what</b> some of her close contemporaries believed: that Davison's actions that day were deliberate" [...] and that she attempted to attach the suffragette colours to the King's horse. Cicely Hale, a suffragette {{who worked at the}} WSPU and who knew Davison, described her as [...] "a fanatic" [...] who was prepared to die but did not mean to. Other observers, such as Purvis, and Ann Morley and Liz Stanley—Davison's biographers—agree that Davison did not mean to die.|$|E

500|$|During {{his student}} years, Lethbridge had frequented the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, {{where he had}} befriended its curator, Louis Clarke. Upon Lethbridge's graduation, Clarke offered him the honorary {{position}} of Keeper of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities at the museum. Lethbridge took up the voluntary and unpaid post, being able to subsist on his family's finances. There, Lethbridge befriended the archaeologist Cyril Fox, aiding in Fox's excavation of the Devil's Dyke in Cambridgeshire. Lethbridge's archaeological excavations were however deemed of poor quality by many of his peers. In turn, Lethbridge derided the archaeological establishment, being frustrated by {{how long it took}} them to <b>accept</b> <b>what</b> he deemed to be [...] "facts", and he believed in focusing on what he believed to be instinct and common sense. There were exceptions to his scorn; for instance, he developed a friendship with T. D. Kendrick, an Anglo-Saxon art historian who then worked as Keeper of the British Museum in London. Over the course of his career at the museum, Lethbridge produced 60 archaeological reports, written in an unusually informal manner that used humour and wit and included narrative descriptions of the excavation process.|$|E

500|$|Following their {{takeover}} of the Caliphate, the Abbasids tried to ensure the Alids' acquiescence through honours and pensions. However, some Alids remained opposed to Abbasid rule, going into hiding and once again trying to rouse the discontented against the new regime. Chief among them were Muhammad ibn Abdallah and his brother Ibrahim. Both had been groomed by their father as leaders since their youth, and some sources even claim that he had received the bay'ah (oath of allegiance) of the Hashimiyya leaders, including the future Caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775), in 744, before the Abbasid Revolution. Muhammad was often called [...] "the Pure Soul" [...] (al-Nafs al-Zakiyya) for his noble character, {{but he was also}} [...] "a somewhat unworldly, even romantic, individual" [...] (Hugh N. Kennedy) and apparently less capable or learned than his younger brother Ibrahim. When the Abbasids took power, the two brothers refused to <b>accept</b> <b>what</b> they regarded as the usurpation of their legitimate rights and went into hiding. From there they continued their work of proselytism, which reportedly brought them as far as the Sindh, although mostly they stayed in Arabia. The first Abbasid caliph, al-Saffah (r. 750–754), was content to mostly ignore their activities, but his successor al-Mansur launched a manhunt against them. In 758, al-Mansur arrested their brother Abdallah when he refused to reveal their whereabouts, followed in early 762 by their cousins and nephews. The captive Alids were taken to Kufa, where they were mistreated so that many of them died.|$|E
500|$|Octavian {{wanted to}} solidify {{his status as}} master of the state, but avoid the fate of his adopted father. On January 13 of 27 BC, Octavian {{transferred}} {{control of the state}} back to the Senate and the People of Rome, but neither the Senate nor the People of Rome were willing to <b>accept</b> <b>what</b> was, in effect, Octavian's resignation. Octavian was allowed to remain Roman Consul (the chief-executive under the old Republic), and was also allowed to retain his tribunician powers (similar to those of the Plebeian Tribunes, or chief representatives of the people). This arrangement, in effect, functioned as a popular ratification of his position within the state. The Senate then granted Octavian a unique grade of Proconsular command power (imperium) which gave him the authority over all of Rome's military governors, and thus, over the entire Roman army. Octavian was also granted the title of [...] "Augustus" [...] ("venerable") and of Princeps ("first citizen"). In 23 BC, Augustus (as Octavian now called himself) gave up his Consulship, and expanded both his Proconsular imperium and his tribunician powers. After these final reforms had been instituted, Augustus never again altered his constitution. Augustus' final goal was to ensure an orderly succession. In 6 BC Augustus granted tribunician powers to his stepson Tiberius, and quickly recognized Tiberius as his heir. In 13 AD a law was passed which made Tiberius' legal powers equivalent to, and independent from, those of Augustus. Within a year, Augustus was dead.|$|E
