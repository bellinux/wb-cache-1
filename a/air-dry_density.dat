Little has been reported about the mechanical properties of the wood. The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanical properties of Pinus patula in more detail, in order to provide a basis for utilizing this resource. The mechanical properties of small clear wood specimens of Pinus pa-tula were evaluated using 40 cm logs from 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 m above the ground. Small clear wood speci-mens were selected and subjected to a bending test in accordance with Japan Industrial Standards (JIS) air-dry conditions. The growth rate did not affect the mechanical properties measured. There were signifi-cant correlations at 1 % level between <b>air-dry</b> <b>density</b> and Modulus Of Elasticity (MOE) (R = 0. 85) and between <b>air-dry</b> <b>density</b> and Modulus Of Rupture (MOR) (R = 0. 83).

30|$|The {{specimens}} {{used were}} heartwood of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica, hereafter, cedar), heartwood of Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi, hereafter, larch), and beech (Fagus crenata). From these woods, straight grain test specimens of 12  mm (L) ×  6  mm (T) ×  70  mm (R) were prepared [with {{the exception of}} the beech, which was 4  mm (T)]. The partial density variation of cedar and larch is large because of the effect of annual rings. All machining was conducted on early wood: density was measured for each segment of early wood cut out, with the <b>air-dried</b> <b>density</b> of the cedar and larch being 0.31 and 0.35  g/cm 3, respectively. The machining area was not limited for the beech, and the <b>air-dried</b> <b>density</b> of the beech was 0.62  g/cm 3.

Two adjacent 60 -mm discs were {{cut from the}} stems at 1.4, 2.5, and 8  m from ground level. A band saw was used to cut a small, northern radial section from the first of each pair of discs. These were then prepared for Silviscan assessment using prescribed protocols (Evans, 1999; Evans & Ilic, 2001). X-ray diffractometery {{was used to assess}} MFA and MOE every 2  mm and <b>air-dry</b> <b>density</b> every 0.025  mm along the radius. The second disc was sanded to make both top and bottom surfaces smooth on a radial section that matched the one sent for Silviscan analysis. This second disc was then used for USV assessment at 2 -mm intervals along the radius using a robot.|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{the spectra}} were {{obtained}} from green condition of the disk and the stiffness of veneer was measured under dry condition. Thus, the current results imply that NIRS can predict the wood stiffness in dry condition using the spectra from wet condition. This fact {{is consistent with previous}} research [16 – 20]. Schimleck et al. [17, 18] reported that various characteristics (<b>air-dry</b> <b>density,</b> microfibril angle, stiffness, tracheid morphological traits) of Pinus taeda wood were successfully modeled using NIR spectra collected from the radial longitudinal and transverse faces when the samples were green and dry. Meglen and Kelley [19] have also shown {{that it is possible to}} determine mechanical properties of dry wood using green wood samples. Fujimoto et al. [20] noted that the specific absorption bands play an important role in prediction of wood density using the spectra collected from any moisture condition.|$|E

30|$|In Shiiba Village, Miyazaki Prefecture, {{people have}} used many trees growing {{in their living}} area for their {{traditional}} life. We interviewed four elder informants who were expert in wood handling on wood physical and mechanical properties and durability in commonly used trees. The informants discriminated 99 tree species empirically and evaluated their toughness, cleavability, warping, checking, abrasion resistance, hardness, machinability, combustibility and durability. Overall the highest rated species were Torreya nucifera and Sciadopitys verticillata, and the next-best species were Taxus cuspidata and Zelkova serrata. On average, coniferous species were evaluated better than hardwood species, and in hardwood, the arbor trees were evaluated better than shrubs. <b>Air-dry</b> <b>density</b> from previous literature was correlated with empirical toughness, machinability, cleavability, hardness, abrasion resistance and combustibility.

In Australia, difficulty in bonding veneers from dense eucalypts (<b>air-dry</b> <b>density</b> above 700  kg/cm 3) are known and some special adhesive formulations {{have been developed for}} these species (Carrick and Mathieu 2005; Ozarska 1999).

Plywood products made from various Eucalyptus species have been reported in China, Malaysia, Uruguay and Brazil indicating that satisfactory bonding can be achieved for many Eucalyptus species (de Carvalho et al. 2004; Hague 2013; Turnbull 2007; Yu et al. 2006).

After that, oriented bamboo fiber bundles were immersed in a PF 162510 phenol–formaldehyde resin (Dynea Co., Beijing City, China). The amount of adhesive was controlled to about 15  % of the dry weight of the bamboo scrimber during dipping glue process. To get the target density (1.10  g/cm 3), a temperature of 140  °C and a pressing pressure of 5.0  MPa were carried out during manufacturing. The holding time is 1  min/mm. The nominal dimension of each bamboo scrimber board was 250  cm (Length) ×  64  cm (Width) ×  3.4  cm (Thickness).

The tangential (T) compression was carried on the vertical grain specimens with the compression direction parallel to the annual ring; the radial (R) compression was carried on the flat grain specimens with the compression direction perpendicular to the annual ring; and the 45 ° compression was carried on in-between tangential and radial specimens with the compression face having 45 ° with the annual ring. The 45 ° compression specimens were tested because in the industry practice, most boards are neither vertical nor flat grain boards, but the boards in-between vertical and flat grain.|$|R

A total of 174 trees {{were randomly selected}} from 10 open-pollinated families in a progeny trial for measuring stem diameter, dynamic Young’s modulus of log (DMOElog), annual ring width (ARW), <b>air-dry</b> <b>density</b> (AD), modulus of elasticity (MOE), and modulus of rupture (MOR). Mean values of DMOElog, AD, MOE, and MOR were 9.60  GPa, 0.41  g/cm 3, 9.44  GPa, and 76.6  MPa, respectively. Significant differences among families were observed in all properties. F values obtained by analyzing variance in wood properties were higher than those generally observed in growth traits. In addition, F values in wood properties remained relatively higher from the 1 st to 25 th annual ring from the pith, although F value in ARW rapidly decreased with each increase in annual ring number. These results indicate that genetic factors largely contributed to the variance in wood properties compared with the growth traits.|$|E
