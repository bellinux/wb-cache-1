5|$|Recent {{scientific}} investigations support Waitt’s proposed {{separation of}} layers into records of sequential flood events. Although the various sources support temporal separation of floods, {{they do not}} definitively identify the source of water {{for all of the}} floods, though they <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> Lake Missoula was source for at least some of them.|$|E
5|$|Historians hold differing {{views as}} to whether the mounted police were neutral in these {{disputes}} or sided with the employers, although <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the position of the police in managing the strikes became more difficult as organised labour became better established. The mounted police disliked labour agitators and strikers with eastern or southern European backgrounds, but they also had some sympathy for the difficulties faced by ordinary workers, and were often unwilling to actively assist the company owners if there was a risk it might cause disturbances to break out.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{differ on}} the exact cause and extent of the {{massacre}} in Maribor. <b>All</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> on 27 January 1919, the Coolidge Mission's delegation, led by Sherman Miles, visited Maribor and found thousands of citizens of German ethnic origin gathered in the main city square and waving flags of German Austria, many of which also decorated nearby buildings. German Austrian sources indicate that there were 10,000 protesters singing songs and wearing patriotic dress. Twenty soldiers under Maister's command were stationed {{in front of the}} city hall, armed with rifles mounted with bayonets.|$|E

5|$|Stymied, Black {{and fellow}} Group member Lara Means (Kristen Cloke) {{investigate}} the ship, finding several bodies {{hidden in a}} crate, all having died of exposure. Black then interviews Law and his crew individually, each time being given a contradicting {{story of how the}} woman came to be on board the ship. However, they <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> after she boarded, crew were discovered daily, dead of exposure on the ship's bow; Law had the woman chained up in the belief she was responsible.|$|E
5|$|Though writers {{disagree}} on {{details of the}} handwriting (see the section on handwriting below), they <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the handwriting of the latter portion of Drexel 4257 is probably that of John Gamble, given {{that there is a}} concentration of his work {{in that part of the}} manuscript. This suggests that the book was begun by someone else (whom Lynn Hulse recognized as Thomas Jordan; see below). Duckles surmised that Gamble came into possession of the book in 1642–43 when the musicians of the Royal Chapel were dispersed as a result of the English Civil War. Although Gamble lost most of his possessions in a fire in 1666, this book appears to have survived. He made out his will on June 30, 1680 in which he bequeathed his grandson (also named John Gamble) all his books of music.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> Andrée's North Pole {{scheme was}} unrealistic. He {{relied on the}} winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} he wanted to go, on being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andrée's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E

25|$|From mid-1943 to mid-1944, {{development}} of the 90mm up-armored T26 prototype continued to proceed slowly due to disagreements within the U.S. Army about its future tank needs. The accounts of what exactly happened during this time vary by historian, but <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> Army Ground Forces was {{the main source of}} resistance that delayed production of the T26.|$|E

25|$|Fall {{achieved}} major Arabic sciences such as theology, fiqh, tafsir, {{grammar and}} rhetoric. Savishinsky (1994) {{tells us that}} Ibrahima Fall had “reputation for ferocity and extraordinary strength” (p.212). Another scholar claims that Fall {{was viewed as a}} troubled man who seldom went with his peers and often remained alone in the bush. However, <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the turning point of his life was Fall’s search for Shaikh Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke.|$|E
25|$|The {{authors also}} point out that the study's {{assessments}} strongly agree with the conclusions of earlier studies conducted by faculty at West Point, the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA), and the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). All four studies concluded that the program suffered from multiple problems in its creation and implementation, which inhibited the effectiveness of the teams in the field. Yet, <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> a high majority of commanders were extremely supportive of the teams and found them effective.|$|E

25|$|The large, long pendent ears {{serve to}} prevent wind from {{scattering}} nearby skin cells while the dog's nose {{is on the}} ground; the folds of wrinkled flesh under the lips and neck—called the shawl—serve to catch stray scent particles in the air or on a nearby branch as the bloodhound is scenting, reinforcing the scent in the dog's memory and nose.

25|$|The Báb {{and one of}} {{his companions}} were {{suspended}} on a wall and a large firing squad prepared to shoot. When the smoke cleared after the first firing of bullets, the Báb was missing. Reports continue by stating that the Báb was found back in his prison room finishing dictation to his secretary. Other sources, which include Persian and European reports, give a variety of accounts, some in agreement with the miracle-like Bahá'í story, and some indicating a less miraculous event. <b>All</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> he survived the first firing squad, and was killed by the second.|$|E
25|$|In response, Brian {{assembled}} {{the forces of}} the Province of Munster with the intention of laying siege to the Hiberno-Norse city of Dublin, which was ruled by Máel Mórda's ally and cousin, Sigtrygg Silkbeard. Together Máel Mórda and Sigtrygg determined to meet Brian's army in battle rather than risk a siege. Thus, in 999, the opposing armies fought the Battle of Glenmama. The Irish annals <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> this was a particularly fierce and bloody engagement, although claims that it lasted from morning until midnight, or that the combined Leinster-Dublin force lost 4,000 killed are open to question. In any case, Brian followed up his victory, as he and his brother had {{in the aftermath of the}} Battle of Sulcoit thirty-two years before, by capturing and sacking the enemy's city.|$|E

25|$|Menzies {{heard of}} Chifley's demise while {{attending}} a parliamentary ball at King's Hall in Parliament House {{to celebrate the}} 50th Jubilee of Federation (Chifley was invited but had declined to attend). Menzies was deeply distressed and abandoned his normally impassive demeanour to announce in a halting subdued voice:It is my very sorrowful duty during this celebration tonight {{to tell you that}} Mr Chifley has died. I don't want to try to talk about him now because, although we were political opponents, he was a friend of mine and yours, and a fine Australian. You will <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> in the circumstances the festivities should end. It doesn't matter about party politics on an occasion such as this. Oddly enough, in Parliament we get on very well. We sometimes find we have the warmest friendships among people whose politics are not ours. Mr Chifley served this country magnificently for years.|$|E
25|$|The synod {{teaches that}} the Word of God, both written and preached, and the Sacraments are means of grace {{through which the}} Holy Spirit gives the gift of God's grace, creates faith {{in the hearts of}} individuals, forgives sins for the sake of Christ's death on the cross, and grants eternal life and salvation. Many Missouri Synod Lutherans define a sacrament as an action instituted by Jesus that {{combines}} a promise in God's Word with a physical element, although the synod holds no official definition for sacrament. This means that some may disagree on the number of sacraments. <b>All</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> Baptism and Communion are sacraments. Confession and absolution is called a sacrament in the Apology of the Augsburg Confession and so is also considered by many Lutherans to be a sacrament, because it was instituted by Christ and has His promise of grace, even though it is not tied to a physical element.|$|E
25|$|News grows even grimmer as Weidling {{reports to}} Hitler {{there are no}} {{reserves}} left, and Mohnke reports that the Red Army is only 300 to 400 metres from the Reich Chancellery. Hitler reassures the officers that General Walther Wenck's 12th Army will save them. After Hitler leaves the conference room, Weidling firmly asks if it is truly possible for Wenck to attack; the generals <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> it is impossible, but still resolve to never surrender. After midnight, Hitler dictates his {{last will and testament}} to Traudl, before marrying Eva Braun. Hitler orders Goebbels to leave Berlin, but Goebbels refuses. The following morning, Weidling reports that not only was Wenck not able to attack, all of their remaining armies are now incapable of any meaningful action, and that the Reich {{is no more than a}} few hours away from total defeat. Finally accepting that there is no hope, Hitler decides to kill himself before he can be captured.|$|E
