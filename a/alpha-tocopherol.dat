2500|$|The {{color of}} red/purple {{beetroot}} {{is due to}} a variety of betalain pigments, unlike most other red plants, such as red cabbage, which contain anthocyanin pigments. The composition of different betalain pigments can vary, resulting in strains of beetroot which are yellow or other colors in addition to the familiar deep red. [...] Some of the betalains in beets are betanin, isobetanin, probetanin, and neobetanin (the red to violet ones are known collectively as betacyanin). Other pigments contained in beet are indicaxanthin and vulgaxanthins (yellow to orange pigments known as betaxanthins). Indicaxanthin has been shown as a powerful protective antioxidant for thalassemia and prevents the breakdown of <b>alpha-tocopherol</b> (Vitamin E).|$|E

[...] It also contains alpha and gamma tocotrienols, but not others. [...] Compared to other vegetable oils, poppyseed oil has a moderate amount of phytosterols: [...] higher than soybean oil and peanut oil, lower than safflower oil, sesame oil, wheat germ oil, corn oil, and rice bran oil. [...] Sterols in poppyseed oil consist almost entirely of campesterol, stigmasterol, sitosterol and delta 5-avenasterol. [...] Poppyseed oil is high in linoleic acid. Although not generally higher than safflower oil, it can be as high as 74.5%. [...] Other triglycerides present in notable quantities are oleic acid and palmitic acid.|$|E
