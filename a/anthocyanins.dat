40|$|<b>Anthocyanin</b> is {{the pigment}} that gives color in plant. <b>Anthocyanin</b> was {{extracted}} from plants to be manufactured as dyes, food coloring and pharmaceutical. This is because <b>anthocyanin</b> is an antioxidant agent. Mangosteen and dragon fruit {{were believed to}} contained the <b>anthocyanin</b> based on their color. This research is about comparison of <b>anthocyanin</b> content in mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana Linn) and red dragon fruit (hylocereus polyrhizus). The content of <b>anthocyanin</b> in both fruits was measured by using pH Differential Method. To use this method, <b>anthocyanin</b> must be extracted from peels of these fruits. Extraction of this <b>anthocyanin</b> then was diluted in different pH of buffers and the reading of absorbance has taken. This step {{is very important to}} calculate the exact <b>anthocyanin</b> content in the samples. There also changes in color during diluting the <b>anthocyanin</b> in different pH of buffer. The result showed the mangosteen sample has high reading of absorbance compared to dragon fruit sample. From this data, the mangosteen sample contained more <b>anthocyanin</b> molecules compared to red dragon fruit sample. The calculation from pH Differential method showed that average of <b>anthocyanin</b> content for mangosteen samples was 75. 50 mg/L and average of <b>anthocyanin</b> content for dragon fruit was 38. 825 mg/L. this result showed that <b>anthocyanin</b> content in the mangosteen was higher compared to red dragon fruit. ...|$|R
5|$|Commelina communis is {{also used}} as a model {{organism}} in plant physiology and plant development to a limited extent, especially in relation to stomatal physiology and the biology of pigmentation development. For example, the blue pigmentation of Asiatic dayflower petals was shown to consist of a large complex of six <b>anthocyanins,</b> six flavones, and two associated magenesium ions, demonstrating that supramolecular complexes of several copigments and chelated metals often determine colour. Other research on the plant has helped to explain photoreceptor systems in plants such as their stomatal responses to blue light versus red light spectrums, abscisic acid perception {{and its role in}} cell signaling, particularly concerning the chemical's role in stomatal function, the role of vanadates in inhibiting stomatal opening, and the necessity of calcium in stomatal closure, among other topics. Its widespread use in stomatal studies {{is due to the fact}} that the leaves produce exceptional epidermal peels that are consistently one cell layer thick. This same quality makes the plant popular for use in laboratory exercises in higher education for demonstrating stomatal function and morphology. Guard cell turgor pressure and its regulation in the opening and closing of stomata is particularly easy to demonstrate with the Asiatic dayflower.|$|E
25|$|The <b>anthocyanins,</b> anthocyanidins {{with sugar}} group(s), are mostly 3-glucosides of the anthocyanidins. The <b>anthocyanins</b> are {{subdivided}} into the sugar-free anthocyanidin aglycones and the anthocyanin glycosides. As of 2003, more than 400 <b>anthocyanins</b> had been reported, while later literature in early 2006, puts the number {{at more than}} 550 different <b>anthocyanins.</b> The difference in chemical structure that occurs in response to changes in pH, {{is the reason why}} <b>anthocyanins</b> often are used as pH indicators, as they change from red in acids to blue in bases.|$|E
25|$|It {{was once}} thought that betalains {{were related to}} <b>anthocyanins,</b> the reddish {{pigments}} found in most plants. Both betalains and <b>anthocyanins</b> are water-soluble pigments found in the vacuoles of plant cells.

25|$|<b>Anthocyanins</b> {{are thought}} to be subject to physiochemical {{degradation}} in vivo and in vitro. Structure, pH, temperature, light, oxygen, metal ions, intramolecular association, and intermolecular association with other compounds (copigments, sugars, proteins, degradation products, etc.) generally are known to affect the color and stability of <b>anthocyanins.</b> B-ring hydroxylation status and pH have been shown to mediate the degradation of <b>anthocyanins</b> to their phenolic acid and aldehyde constituents. Indeed, significant portions of ingested <b>anthocyanins</b> are likely to degrade to phenolic acids and aldehyde in vivo, following consumption. This characteristic confounds scientific isolation of specific anthocyanin mechanisms in vivo.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Effects of drying {{treatments}} on <b>anthocyanin,</b> fumonisin B 1, aflatoxin B 1 {{content of}} <b>anthocyanin</b> extract from purple corn were evaluated {{based on the}} harvest of 2008 and 2009 in north China. The <b>anthocyanin</b> content of <b>anthocyanin</b> extract from husk was 62. 4 g/kg, being significant higher than that from cob and seed. The fumonisin B 1 and aflatoxin B 1 content of <b>anthocyanin</b> extract from the husk were 4. 25 and 5. 60 µg/kg, respectively, according with legislative limitation of USFDA. Moreover, the fumonisin B 1 and aflatoxin B 1 content of <b>anthocyanin</b> extract from the husk were lower than the maximum limitation of USFDA even after each drying treatments. Therefore, the husk of the purple corn in north China was feasible for <b>anthocyanin</b> production due to its high <b>anthocyanin</b> content and low fumonisin B 1 and aflatoxin B 1 content...|$|R
40|$|The <b>anthocyanin</b> {{content of}} spring and winter wheat cultivars and their hybrids with purple and blue {{coloured}} grains was evaluated under Hungarian growing conditions.

In the progenies of crosses between Hungarian hard red winter wheat cultivars and blue-grained varieties, the <b>anthocyanin</b> content of the grind was 21 – 157 mg/kg, while that of the flour was 5. 3 – 17. 4 mg/kg. Consequently, most of the <b>anthocyanin</b> content was in the bran.

25|$|With the {{exception}} of very few varieties, known as teinturiers, most wine grapes produce clear or colorless juice.

40|$|Hormones {{are likely}} to be {{important}} factors modulating the light-dependent <b>anthocyanin</b> accumulation.

25|$|Although <b>anthocyanins</b> {{have been}} shown to have {{antioxidant}} properties in vitro, there is no evidence for anthocyanin antioxidant effects in the body after the plant is consumed.

The increase in antioxidant capacity of blood seen after the consumption of anthocyanin-rich foods may not be caused directly by the <b>anthocyanins</b> in the food, but instead, may result from increased uric acid levels derived from the metabolism of the flavonoids in the food.

25|$|<b>Anthocyanins</b> are {{phenolic}} compounds {{found throughout the}} plant kingdom, being frequently responsible for the blue to red colors found in flowers, fruits and leaves. In wine grapes, they develop during the stage of veraison when the skin of red wine grapes changes color from green to red to black. As the sugars in the grape increase during ripening so does the concentration of <b>anthocyanins.</b> In most grapes <b>anthocyanins</b> are found only in the outer cell layers of the skin, leaving the grape juice inside virtually colorless. Therefore, to get color pigmentation in the wine, the fermenting must {{needs to be in}} contact with the grape skins in order for the <b>anthocyanins</b> to be extracted. Hence, white wine can be made from red wine grapes {{in the same way that}} many white sparkling wines are made from the red wine grapes of Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier.
