500|$|Following Die Another Day, Madonna {{collaborated with}} fashion {{photographer}} Steven Klein in 2003 for an exhibition installation named X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS. It included photography from {{a photo shoot}} in W magazine, and seven video segments. The installation ran from March to May in New York's Deitch Projects gallery. It traveled the world in an edited form. The same year, Madonna released her ninth studio album, American Life, {{which was based on}} her observations of American society; it received mixed reviews. She commented, [...] " [...] was like a trip down memory lane, looking back at everything I've accomplished <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I once valued <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that were important to me." [...] Larry Flick from The Advocate felt that [...] "American Life is an album that is among her most adventurous and lyrically intelligent" [...] while condemning it as [...] "a lazy, half-arsed effort to sound and take her seriously." [...] The title song peaked at number 37 on the Hot 100. Its original music video was canceled as Madonna thought that the video, featuring violence and war imagery, would be deemed unpatriotic since America was then at war with Iraq. With four million copies sold worldwide, American Life was the lowest-selling album of her career at that point.|$|E

500|$|... "The Gloaming (Softly Open our Mouths in the Cold)" [...] is an {{electronic}} song with [...] "mechanical rhythms" [...] that Jonny Greenwood built from tape loops.

[...] Yorke felt the song was [...] "the most explicit protest song on the record...

500|$|British {{television}} director David Yates {{was chosen}} to direct the film after Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire director Mike Newell, as well as Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Guillermo del Toro, Matthew Vaughn and Mira Nair, turned down offers. Yates believed he was approached because the studio saw him fit to handle an [...] "edgy and emotional" [...] film with a [...] "political backstory", which some of his previous television projects including State of Play, Sex Traffic and The Girl in the Café demonstrated. Producer David Heyman supported Yates' comments about the film's political theme, stating that [...] " [...] is a political film, not with a capital P, but it's about teen rebellion and the abuse of power. David has made films in the UK about politics without being heavy handed." [...] On the film's political and social aspects, Emma Watson stated that [...] "somehow it talks about life after 7 July, the way people behave when they’re scared, the way truth is often denied <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> our society has to face.

500|$|... "Lacrymosa" [...] {{incorporates}} the Lacrimosa sequence from Mozart's Requiem (1791). It additionally includes a 22-piece orchestra led by Dave Campbell and background vocals by The Millennium Choir. Inspired {{by the film}} Amadeus, the song contains electronic backing beats, symphonic string section, heavy guitar and a haunting choir. Its vocals make a contrasting representation of light and dark. Jim Farber of Daily News compared the song with the works of English progressive rock band Renaissance. [...] "Like You" [...] is written in memory of Lee's deceased sister, as was [...] "Hello" [...] on Fallen. Concerning this, the singer said, [...] "I can't help but be affected by that, and if it's my place to express myself <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that have been most deep and the most painful and have just touched me, I feel like it does honor her". One of the most personal songs on the album, [...] "Like You", contains lyrics which yearn for death so Lee can be with her sister. which are accompanied by heavy riffing guitars. Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield found similarities between the track and American rock band My Chemical Romance's song [...] "Helena" [...] (2005); other critics compared the song with Evanescence's earlier material on Fallen. [...] "Lose Control" [...] was inspired by Balsamo's loud guitar and contains influences from Portishead. The protagonist shows her anger through the lines, [...] "You don't remember my name, I don't really care". According to Lee, the song is about wanting to be less apprehensive and looser.|$|E
500|$|Deja Entendus first single, [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows", {{impacted}} radio airplay in July 2003, a {{month after}} the album's release. The song was said to be about regret, or, as Lacey stated, [...] "how there can be problems in a relationship and they get ignored. And how that often ends up as a broken home or some kind of bad situation down the road. It's kind of something that if it wasn't overlooked in the first place, you can kind of get through it." [...] The song's music video chronicles the moments after a severe car accident, where a mortally wounded Lacey cannot depart for the next world until he knows that his girlfriend, also injured in the crash, is safe in this one. He says it [...] "is about death or losing someone and it's those moments that you kind of look back on your life and realize all the regrets that you had, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> you wish you could change". They also made a music video for the second single, [...] "Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades," [...] where Lacey acts like a human voodoo doll; discovering that when he moves a particular body part, it is mimicked by the target of his action. [...] "Since the song is about taking advantage of someone else," [...] he said, [...] "there's a pretty strong correlation between the video and the song." [...] Both music videos gave the band exposure in the mainstream where Your Favorite Weapon went [...] "virtually unnoticed", with the videos finding [...] "constant" [...] airplay on MTV and the band making its live television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Furthermore, both singles entered the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows" [...] peaked at number 37 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.|$|E

500|$|Archie's {{murder was}} {{compared}} to that of Den Watts in EastEnders in 2005 by Polly Hudson of the Daily Mirror, while Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian called it a rip-off of Citizen Kane. Andrew Grimes from Manchester Evening News said the Christmas Day episode was [...] "in every sense compelling, and to my utter astonishment, a complete and utter joy", and John Gibson of Edinburgh Evening News gave the murder discovery episode on 26 December 2009 a negative review, saying [...] "Hard to tell what was most horrific... the murder, which was bloody, the acting, which was dire, or the script, which was torture." [...] Tim Teeman of The Times called the revelation of Stacey as Archie's killer a [...] "genuine surprise", while Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald felt that revealing Stacey as Archie's killer was [...] "a slight let-down" [...] and [...] "a little bit predictable". The storyline was nominated in the Killer Secret category at the 2010 All About Soap Bubble Awards. It also received a nomination in the Best Storyline category at the 2010 British Soap Awards and the Best Soap Storyline category at the 2010 TVChoice Awards. Real life police detectives criticised the portrayal of detectives in the show, saying that viewers who see them talking to residents about the case and accepting bribes may believe they operate that way in reality. The BBC insisted that a police consultant was used, adding that [...] "this is heightened fiction <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that we show might not always represent real life." [...] The storyline was referenced by Prime Minister Gordon Brown when referring to allegations of bullying, saying [...] "The only thing I haven't been accused of is murdering that guy Archie Mitchell in EastEnders." ...|$|E
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> you want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in the bowels of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|E

Its treatment of free will relies on Anselm's earlier works, but goes into greater detail as to the ways in which there is no actual incompatibility or paradox created by the divine attributes. In its 5th chapter, Anselm reprises his consideration of eternity from the Monologion. [...] "Although nothing is there except what is present, it is not the temporal present, like ours, but rather the eternal, within which all times altogether are contained. If in a certain way the present time contains every place <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that are in any place, likewise, every time is encompassed in the eternal present, and everything that is in any time."
