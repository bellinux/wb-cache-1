Unbeknownst to the Burmese command, the city had been {{reinforced}} by Siamese troops led {{by none other than}} Naresuan. The army was driven back.

The Siamese army now laid siege to Pegu.|$|R

In 1383, her 15-year-old half-brother Binnya Nwe raised a small rebellion out of Dagon {{with help from}} opposing factions of the court. Maru tried {{to put down the}} rebellion but was driven back in November 1383. After Binnya U's death on 2 January 1384, Maru tried to rally the court to back him.

50|$|But {{they did}} not get far and were arrested. On 5 January 1384, {{on the day of}} the coronation, the couple were tied to a pole at the royal {{elephant}} stables for all to see. The Razadarit Ayedawbon states that Maha Dewi collapsed when she saw Maru <b>and</b> <b>Thiri</b> tied to the pole. Nwe before starting the coronation ordered Maru executed. Thiri apparently escaped the execution. The chronicle does not say that the new king, about to take the title Razadarit, ordered the execution of his half-sister Thiri.|$|R

5000|$|Dinamalar review quoted {{that the}} concept of telepathy in [...] "Nunnunarvu" [...] movie is new to Tamil cinema and that the movie is {{different}} and fast-paced. Mathivanan Sakthivel has perfectly fit the character of Chandru in the film. The scenes where the Chandru and Charu characters connect for the first time through telepathy and scenes where both feel the feelings of each other are interesting scenes in the film. The editing by Suresh Urs is fault less and the cinematography is good. The villain characters played by Dinesh <b>and</b> <b>Thiri</b> <b>and</b> the character Anitha are good. The melody songs composed by Mayu Ganehsan are pleasing. The scenes where the Charu character is abducted doesn't look new and these type of scenes are common in Tamil cinema. In summary the film [...] "Nunnunarvu"is new concept to Tamil cinema.|$|R

2500|$|To {{defend the}} delta, they rushed four army and naval troops led by Smim Payu, Smim Bya Thamaik (later Minister-General Binnya Law), Smim Than-Kye, <b>and</b> <b>Thiri</b> Zeya Nawrahta. The four commanders were to defend four key delta towns (Myaungmya, Bassein, Khebaung, Dala). Smim Payu was the admiral of the {{southern}} Toungoo navy, which had the unenviable task of facing the highly experienced Arakanese navy. Nanda Yawda was appointed commander of the remaining Toungoo war boats at Prome. To meet the Arakanese army, Bayinnaung formed three armies, each consisted of 2000 troops, 800 horses, and 50 elephants. He personally commanded the center army while <b>Thiri</b> Zeya Kyawhtin <b>and</b> Nanda Thingyan led the armies to his left and right respectively. They quietly left their positions since {{they did not want}} the Prome command to know that only a skeleton crew {{was in charge of the}} [...] "siege".|$|R

25|$|By {{capturing}} Ratchaburi, the Burmese had now fought {{their way}} out of the narrow isthmus, and made it to the mainland Siam. It was late March 1760 (early Tagu 1121 ME). As the invasion army approached Ayutthaya, the Siamese forces, which already suffered heavy losses in men, guns and ammunition, made another stand at Suphanburi, immediately to west of the capital. The defenses consisted of over 33,000 men (including 3000 cavalry), and their mission was to stop the Burmese from crossing the river that separates Ayutthaya from Suphanburi. The Burmese launched a three pronged attack (led by Hsinbyushin in the center flanked by generals Minkhaung Nawrahta <b>and</b> Minhla <b>Thiri)</b> on heavily fortified Siamese positions. The Burmese took heavy losses but ultimately prevailed, taking five senior Siamese commanders and their war elephants.|$|R
