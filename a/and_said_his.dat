5|$|Despite taking {{victory in}} the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix, Alonso was facing {{pressure}} heading into {{the second half of}} the season; he was forty-seven points behind Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship after scoring four points in the last two races. Alonso had been largely affected by safety car periods in Valencia and Silverstone despite his team having narrowed the performance gap on their championship rivals. However, Alonso remained upbeat about his title chances <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>his</b> team had more motivation to succeed despite his recent results. Hamilton, the defending race winner at the Hockenheimring, felt the race would give an indication on form for {{the second half of the}} year and believed McLaren should have a successful balance of their car in order to be competitive at the track.|$|E

25|$|Opposition parties claim Berlusconi was {{not able}} to achieve the goals he promised in his Contratto con gli Italiani. Some of his {{partners}} in government, especially the National Alliance and the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, admitted the Government fell short of the promises made in the agreement, attributing the failure to an unforeseeable downturn in global economic conditions. Berlusconi himself consistently asserted that he achieved all the goals of the agreement, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>his</b> Government provided un miracolo continuo (a continuous miracle) that made all 'earlier governments pale' (by comparison). He attributed the widespread failure to recognise these achievements to a campaign of mystification and vilification in the print media, asserting that 85% of newspapers were opposed to him. Luca Ricolfi, an independent analyst, held that Berlusconi had managed to deliver only one promise out of five, the one concerning minimum pension rates. According to Ricolfi, the other four promises were not honoured, in particular the undertakings on tax simplification and crime reduction.|$|E

500|$|Shaw {{was born}} and brought up in Holt, Norfolk, and made his acting debut at age eight at a London theatre. He studied acting at Gresham's School and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Although he worked {{primarily}} on the London stage, he made his Broadway debut in 1929, when he played {{one of the two}} murderers in Rope's End. He appeared in his first film, Caste, in 1930 and quickly began to create a name for himself in films.

The team steadily improved until his fifth season, 1976, when they finished the regular season with an 11–0 record, their first perfect mark since Tatum's 1955 squad. Boomer Esiason later described Claiborne's coaching style as [...] "vanilla", <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>his</b> strategy was [...] "run right, run left, run up the middle, punt, and play good defense." [...] He went on to say, [...] "But, there's no question he made me a tougher player [...] [...] [...] We'd do drills where the quarterback had to take on a linebacker.

500|$|Elvis Is Back! {{represented}} a new sound for Presley; it moved him further toward pop music, a direction {{he continued to}} take {{over much of the}} decade.

The album includes a variety of material; Presley and the session musicians, known as [...] "The Nashville A-Team", had the benefit of recording equipment that was state-of-the-art for its time.
