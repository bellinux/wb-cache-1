I suppose, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have (and could not have) expressed myself in this way that I saw it as little more than a mathematical curiosity, fit more for amateurs than for the attention of the serious mathematician that I then hoped to become.

[...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{of their}} most notable episodes was [...] "Homer's Enemy", an episode {{designed}} to [...] "push the envelope conceptually." [...] The idea for [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] was first conceived by Oakley, who thought that Homer should have an enemy. This evolved into {{the concept of a}} [...] "real world" [...] co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the latter as they thought it would have funnier results. The result was the character of Frank Grimes, a man who has had to work hard all his life with nothing to show for it and is dismayed and embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance. [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; in some scenes, his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the close of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering [...] "real American hero," [...] is relegated to the role of antagonist; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious. Oakley says the episode was [...] "hyper-meta" [...] and focused on [...] "parodying to some degree the Homer we don't like. That's {{one of the things that}} episode is supposed to illustrate– 'Homer gone wrong'. <b>Although,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> argue that in 'Homer's Enemy' he's not even really even all that excessively stupid or immature, actually." [...] Weinstein said: [...] "We wanted to do an episode where the thinking was 'What if a real life, normal person had to enter Homer's universe and deal with him?' I know this episode is controversial and divisive, but I just love it. It really feels like what would happen if a real, somewhat humorless human had to deal with Homer. There was some talk [...] about the ending—we just did that because (a) it’s really funny and shocking, (2) we like the lesson of 'sometimes, you just can't win'—the whole Frank Grimes episode is a study in frustration and hence Homer has the last laugh and (3) we wanted to show that in real life, being Homer Simpson could be really dangerous and life threatening, as Frank Grimes sadly learned." [...] When the episode was first broadcast, many fans felt it was too dark, unfunny and that Homer was portrayed as overly bad-mannered. On the DVD commentary, Weinstein considers this episode one of the most controversial of the seasons he ran, as it involves sharp observational humor which many fans [...] "didn't get." [...] Weinstein talks about a [...] "generation gap"—the episode was originally panned by viewers, but has since become a favorite among fans who grew up with the show.|$|E
