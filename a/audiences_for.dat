5|$|After the ban was lifted, Clouzot {{reestablished}} {{his reputation}} and popularity in France {{during the late}} 1940s with successful films including Quai des Orfèvres. After the release of his comedy film Miquette et sa mère, Clouzot married Véra Gibson-Amado, who would star in his next three feature films. In the early and mid-1950s, Clouzot drew acclaim from international critics and <b>audiences</b> <b>for</b> The Wages of Fear and Les Diaboliques. Both films would serve as source material for remakes decades later. After the release of La Vérité, Clouzot's wife Véra {{died of a heart}} attack and Clouzot's career suffered due to depression, illness and new critical views of films from the French New Wave. Clouzot's career became less active in later years, limited to a few television documentaries and two feature films in the 1960s. Clouzot wrote several unused scripts in the 1970s and died in Paris in 1977.|$|E
5|$|After this {{bout with}} the censors, Takechi vowed {{to produce a}} true, {{hardcore}} film for Japanese audiences. The result was Sacred Koya (Koya Hijiri), based on a work by Kyōka Izumi. He refused to allow the film to be censored in any way, either through cutting or fogging. Refusing to release the film in Japan, he did not submit it for Eirin's approval. Instead, he released it in Guam, where it played primarily to Japanese tourist <b>audiences</b> <b>for</b> several years under the U.S.'s more liberal pornography laws. Takechi's last film was another remake of Daydream in 1987, again starring Kyōko Aizome. Though it was a low-budget, independent production which again underwent censorship in Japan, it became very popular in its uncensored form in France.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many feel}} the show's quality {{declined}} over the years, Last of the Summer Wine continued to receive large <b>audiences</b> <b>for</b> the BBC and was praised for its positive portrayal {{of older people}} and family-friendly humour. Many members of the Royal Family enjoyed the show. The programme was nominated for numerous awards and won the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Programme in 1999. There were twenty-one Christmas specials, three television films and a documentary film about the series. Last of the Summer Wine inspired other adaptations, including a television prequel, several novelisations, and stage adaptations.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the Hollywood {{characters}} Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto {{were popular}} in the Indies, as were imported detective films in general; however, no films in that genre had yet been produced domestically. This led Jo to make a detective film which he thought would be successful with ethnic Chinese <b>audiences.</b> <b>For</b> this, he approached L.V. Wijnhamer, Jr., an Indo man who was popular within the ethnic Chinese community for his social work; Wijnhamer, better known as Pah Wongso, helped educate abandoned children, ran an employment office, and raised funds for Red Cross aid in war-torn China. Wijnhamer accepted the role.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} months of 1894, Robey {{returned}} to London to honour {{a contract for}} Augustus Harris at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, the details of which are unknown. In September he starred {{in a series of}} stand-up comedy shows that he would perform every September between 1894 and 1899. These short performances, in English seaside resorts including Scarborough and Bournemouth, were designed chiefly to enhance his name among provincial <b>audiences.</b> <b>For</b> the 1895 and 1896 Christmas pantomimes, he appeared in Manchester and Birmingham, respectively, in the title role of Dick Whittington, for which he received favourable reviews and praise from audiences. Despite the show's success, Robey and his co-stars disliked the experience. The actress Ada Reeve felt that the production had a bad back-stage atmosphere and was thankful when the season ended, while the comedian Barry Lupino was dismayed at having his role, Muffins, considerably reduced.|$|E
5|$|In works where elves are {{the main}} characters, such as The Silmarillion or Wendy and Richard Pini’s comic book series Elfquest, elves exhibit a similar range of {{behaviour}} to a human cast, distinguished largely by their superhuman physical powers. However, where narratives are more human-centered, as in The Lord of the Rings, elves tend to sustain their role as powerful, sometimes threatening, outsiders. Despite the obvious fictionality of fantasy novels and games, scholars have found that elves in these works {{continue to have a}} subtle role in shaping the real-life identities of their <b>audiences.</b> <b>For</b> example, elves can function to encode real-world racial others in video games, or to influence gender-norms through literature.|$|E

5|$|Bon Jovi's third album, Slippery When Wet (1986), mixed {{hard rock}} with a pop {{sensitivity}} {{and spent a}} total of 8 weeks {{at the top of}} the Billboard 200 album chart, selling 12 million copies in the US while becoming the first hard rock album to spawn three top 10 singles — two of which reached number one. The album has been credited with widening the <b>audiences</b> <b>for</b> the genre, particularly by appealing to women as well as the traditional male dominated audience, and opening the door to MTV and commercial success for other bands at the end of the decade. The anthemic The Final Countdown (1986) by Swedish group Europe was an international hit, reaching number eight on the US charts while hitting the top 10 in nine other countries. This era also saw more glam-infused American hard rock bands come to the forefront, with both Poison and Cinderella releasing their multi-platinum début albums in 1986. Van Halen released 5150 (1986), their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals, which was number one in the US for three weeks and sold over 6 million copies. By the second half of the decade, hard rock had become the most reliable form of commercial popular music in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Television <b>audiences</b> <b>for</b> {{the final}} reached more than 10million in both Spain and the United Kingdom. 11.3million people watched the match on Spain's Antena 3 network – the largest viewing figures for that {{station in the}} past year – while another 600,000 watched on Canal+ Spain. In the United Kingdom, however, {{although}} the match received the highest ratings of any programme that evening, viewing figures were down by 1.5million on the previous year's final, with just 9.6million watching on ITV1, although an additional 1.79million watched on Sky Sports 1. Despite there being no Italian or French representative in the final, the figures were much the same in those two countries as they were in Spain and the United Kingdom, with Italy's Rai Uno garnering an average viewership of 9.63million and France's TF1 receiving 8.25million. Only 6.55million people watched the match on Germany's Sat.1 channel. According to a survey, global viewing figures for the match averaged 109million; this put the UEFA Champions League final above the Super Bowl (106million viewers in 2009) as the most-watched annual sporting event in the world. Total figures, which included viewers who watched only part of the match, put the Champions League final even further ahead of the Super Bowl, with 206million viewers compared to 162million.|$|E
5|$|The director's {{original}} cut of Sholay has {{a different}} ending in which Thakur kills Gabbar, along with some additional violent scenes. Gabbar's death scene, and the scene in which the imam's son is killed, were cut from the film by India's Censor Board, as was the scene in which Thakur's family is massacred. The Censor Board {{was concerned about the}} violence, and that viewers may be influenced to violate the law by punishing people severely. Although Sippy fought to keep the scenes, eventually he had to re-shoot the ending of the film, and as directed by the Censor Board, have the police arrive just before Thakur can kill Gabbar. The censored theatrical version was the only one seen by <b>audiences</b> <b>for</b> fifteen years. The original, unedited cut of the film finally came out in a British release on VHS in 1990. Since then, Eros International has released two versions on DVD. The director's cut of the film preserves the original full frame and is 204minutes in length; the censored widescreen version is 198minutes long.|$|E
