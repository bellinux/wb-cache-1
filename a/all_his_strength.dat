He wrote numerous pamphlets during the short-lived Second French Republic, attacked the Roman expedition with <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> and was from the first an uncompromising opponent of Prince Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (Napoleon III).|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the red light of the Advance came into sight, Captain Gallant was the only man left alive. The vessel came within {{quarter of a mile}} of him, and he made one more desperate effort to attract attention. In his own words he shouted and screeched without stopping, and within 20 minutes was picked up in an almost {{unconscious}} condition by the ship's boat. <b>All</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> had vanished and the boat containing him was hauled up on board the schooner, and he was lifted into the captain's cabin where spirits were administered and his limbs were rubbed to restore the circulation of the blood. Spirits in very small quantities were given to him and the terrible thirst from which he was suffering was gradually allayed. Captain Gallant subsequently managed to obtain a few hours sleep, and upon awakening, although extremely weak from exhaustion and exposure, was able to relate the privations through which he had passed.|$|E
2500|$|Neither man {{wanted the}} blame for causing the {{impending}} war. Cavour noted that Napoleon began by stating that {{he was determined to}} support [...] with <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> in a war against Austria, on the condition that the war was not in support of a revolutionary cause and could be justified in diplomatic terms and, more importantly, before public opinion in France and in Europe.|$|E

2500|$|Escrivá {{conceived}} the Mass as the [...] "Source and {{summit of the}} Christian's interior life," [...] a terminology which was later used by the Second Vatican Council. According to Giovanni Battista Re, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, [...] "St. Josemaría strove with <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> to make the Eucharist {{the center of his}} life... For him, Jesus was not an example to imitate from afar, an abstract moral ideal, but his Jesus, a person we should live alongside continuously." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sportacus (played by Magnús Scheving) is {{the local}} superhero. He resides in a blue airship above LazyTown and is alerted to {{impending}} people who needs help by a beeping an crystal who glows on the chest of his costume. Understanding, courageous, and helpful, he is devoted to exercise and has a rivalry with Robbie Rotten. Sportacus lives on a diet of fruit and vegetables, which {{he refers to as}} [...] "sports candy". Eating junk food makes him immediately lose <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> and abilities, which can only be restored by eating healthier options.|$|E
2500|$|His co-stars on {{the show}} would {{frequently}} mock him for being Canadian and for his receding hairline, though this did not come until later as very {{early on in the}} UK version, Mochrie still had a fairly full head of hair. Instead, the bald jokes were done {{at the expense of the}} UK host, Clive Anderson. In the American version, he would often perform the female role in certain frequently-performed skits, such as [...] "Whose Line" [...] and [...] "Two Line Vocabulary". [...] In the few times he played the man in the scene, the producers were making further fun of his baldness (e.g. Colin was Samson, and Ryan was his girlfriend, and Samson had lost <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> because Ryan had cut off his hair). While initially the co-anchor in the beginning, he would be cast as the anchor in the [...] "Weird Newscasters" [...] segment (the position had previously been played by Greg Proops and Brad Sherwood), wherein he would frequently begin by announcing himself with a fictitiously humorous name (e.g. Jose Canyousee) and continue with a fake news report that ended in an unexpected and pun-laden segue.|$|E
5000|$|David Jeffries of AllMusic gave Dame Fortune 4 stars out of 5, {{calling it}} [...] "a {{culmination}} album with an artist's evolution pushing things forward with <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strengths</b> in tow." [...] Meanwhile, Adam Kivel of Consequence of Sound gave the album a grade of C+, noting that [...] "the entirety of the record, in fact, feels like it's trailing {{a few years}} behind." ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Henry put out <b>all</b> <b>his</b> {{enormous}} <b>strength,</b> and Good and I did the same, {{with such}} power as nature had given us.|$|R
60|$|Putting forth <b>all</b> <b>his</b> {{remaining}} <b>strength,</b> the Parisian twisted {{from the}} Dowager's encircling grasp and hurled her from {{him with a}} violence he nowise intended.|$|R

60|$|Both crawled {{from the}} narrow opening, and Dan pulled upon the ring with <b>all</b> of <b>his</b> <b>strength.</b> Up came a trap-door {{about two feet}} square. Beneath this was a space of inky darkness.|$|R
5000|$|When Dixon {{began playing}} for Strothers in the 1920s, the outfield for the Giants {{was one of}} the best of all time; Dixon, Oscar Charleston, and Fats Jenkins. The lineup, in its entirety, scored runs at a higher pace than the 1927 New York Yankees. Dixon had many weapons; speed, hitting, and power were <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strengths</b> and he became known as a triple threat. In 1929, he batted [...]382 with seven home runs, and led the league with six triples.|$|R
60|$|It needed <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> {{and that}} of his companions to drag each of the bodies fifty yards away.|$|E

60|$|The man swung <b>his</b> ax with <b>all</b> <b>his</b> mighty <b>strength,</b> but the {{powerful}} brute seized it in those terrible hands, and tearing it from Clayton's grasp hurled it far to one side.|$|R
60|$|He waited awhile, {{letting the}} Portugee exhaust himself {{in efforts to}} hurl him to the ground. Then {{suddenly}} tightening his grip, Leonard put out <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength.</b> He could not hope to lift the man, that he knew, but he might throw him. With a sudden movement he hooked his right leg behind Xavier's left calf. Then he cast his weight forward and pushed with <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> upon the great man's breast.|$|E

50|$|Jean-Marie Hardouin (played by Louis Bouwmeester) {{is an old}} man {{who once}} was notorious because of the iron grip he exerted on his family but now he is lame.

Jean-Marie can't intervene and because he can't talk he can't warn his own family. Eventually he gathers <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strengths</b> and strangles her.|$|R
60|$|Another hour {{passed and}} his thirst {{seemed to grow}} upon him every minute. Then he grew desperate, and bracing himself, tried with <b>all</b> of <b>his</b> <b>strength</b> to burst the hollow tree asunder. But the effort availed nothing.|$|R
6000|$|The sophomore pulled {{and tugged}} with <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>strength,</b> yet {{he could not}} {{dislodge}} Ken. The freshmen howled gleefully for him to [...] "Hang! hang!" ...|$|E

60|$|The animal heaved {{in a final}} convulsion, and, {{despite the}} rope, kicked out with <b>all</b> <b>his</b> last <b>strength.</b> A tablespoonful of black clot came forth, the {{trickling}} of red blood having ceased for some seconds.|$|R
60|$|With <b>all</b> <b>his</b> {{remaining}} <b>strength</b> the ape-man {{drove home}} the blade--once, twice, thrice, {{and then all}} went black before him as he felt himself, still in the clutches of the Tor-o-don, topple from the recess.|$|R
