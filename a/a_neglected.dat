Each year between 50 and 528million people are {{infected}} and approximately 10,000 to 20,000 die. The earliest descriptions of an outbreak date from 1779. Its viral cause and spread were understood by the early 20th century. Apart from eliminating the mosquitoes, work is ongoing for medication targeted directly at the virus. It is classified as <b>a</b> <b>neglected</b> tropical disease.|$|E
5|$|Hayward assumed {{command of}} the Naval Ordnance Laboratory at White Oak, Maryland in June 1954. He was the first naval aviator to do so, all the {{previous}} commanders having been naval ordnance officers. Under his guidance, the Naval Ordnance Laboratory developed the Mark 52 naval mine, an air-delivered weapon with acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors. Hayward encountered some resistance with this project, as mine warfare was <b>a</b> <b>neglected</b> field in the Navy. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory also developed the Mark 90 nuclear bomb, a nuclear depth charge, which was tested during Operation Wigwam in May 1955.|$|E

Around €3.5 billion will be invested by the Serbian government and their Emirati partners. The project includes office and luxury apartment buildings, five-star hotels, a shopping mall and Belgrade Tower. The project is, however, considered by many as 'controversial', since {{there are a number}} of uncertainties regarding its funding, necessity, as well as chosen architectural solutions.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 6.6 million people, mostly in Mexico, Central America and South America, have Chagas disease as of 2015. In 2015, Chagas was estimated to result in 8,000 deaths.

Large-scale population movements have increased the areas where Chagas disease is found and these include many European countries and the United States. These areas have also seen {{an increase in the}} years up to 2014. The disease was first described in 1909 by the Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas, after whom it is named. Chagas disease is classified as <b>a</b> <b>neglected</b> tropical disease. It affects more than 150 other animals.|$|E

After fulfilling additional requirements, the piñata will become a resident, changing into a full-color version.|$|E
30|$|Finally, one cannot {{ignore that}} the drug quality problem is in part a {{consequence}} {{of political and economic}} abandonment. The structural neglect of the livestock sector and pastoralist communities is an enduring characteristic of Nigerian society. It is <b>a</b> <b>neglect</b> that has allowed the withering of crucial animal health services as well as painfully slow responses to readily apparent problems. It is also <b>a</b> <b>neglect</b> that allows unhelpful misconceptions about the practices of cattle owners to solidify - fallacies that must be actively challenged. With momentum apparently now building to tackle the issue of substandard veterinary drugs in Nigeria, careful planning and research will be required to carry out interventions that start to unwind rather than perpetuate this neglect.|$|R

5|$|Henry died in 1542 and his son, Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland, {{inherited}} the family estates. During the Rising of the North, in which Catholic magnates rebelled against ElizabethI, Henry remained {{loyal to the}} Tudor dynasty despite the Cliffords being a Catholic family. He dismantled Appleby Castle {{to prevent it from}} being used against royal forces, {{and at the same time}} put Brougham at the service of the Elizabethan government, although there was no fighting at the castle. Under the second and third earls, Henry and George, the castle was still used as a residence, with the third earl being born at Brougham Castle. However, it was under George that the building began to decay and by 1592 it was deserted. George Clifford spent much time either in southern England in his role as Queen's Champion or at Skipton. An inventory of the castle's contents in 1595 demonstrates that the structure was <b>a</b> <b>neglected,</b> meagrely furnished place, and what little furniture there was old and in disrepair.|$|E
5|$|Merrifield opens The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic by {{discussing}} how archaeologists have understood magic and ritual practices in past societies, opining {{that on the}} whole it had been <b>a</b> <b>neglected</b> area of study. Looking at the archaeological evidence for ritual activity in the pre-Roman Iron Age and the Roman Iron Age of Britain, he discusses animal and human sacrifice, {{as well as the}} offering of votive deposits in rivers and other bodies of water. He moves on to explore the rituals surrounding death and burial, suggesting areas where this ritual activity is visible in the burial record of multiple societies. Merrifield goes on to discuss the archaeological evidence for ritual practices in Christian Europe, highlighting areas of ritual continuance from earlier pagan periods, in particular the deposition of metal goods in water. Looking at the evidence for foundation deposits in European buildings that likely had magico-religious purposes, he then looks at several examples of written charms and spells which have survived in the archaeological record.|$|E

Archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases.

He had heard stories about the tomb of Archimedes, {{but none of the}} locals were able to give him the location. Eventually he found the tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in <b>a</b> <b>neglected</b> condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up, and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription. A tomb discovered in the courtyard of the Hotel Panorama in Syracuse in the early 1960s was claimed to be that of Archimedes, but there was no compelling evidence for this and the location of his tomb today is unknown.|$|E
