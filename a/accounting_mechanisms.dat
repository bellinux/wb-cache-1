40|$|Lately, {{the problem}} of {{designing}} multi-stage dynamic mechanisms {{has been shown to}} be both theoretically challenging and practically important. In this paper, we consider {{the problem of}} designing revenue optimal dynamic mechanism for a setting where an auctioneer sells a set of items to a buyer in multiple stages. At each stage, there could be multiple items for sale but each item can only appear in one stage. The type of the buyer at each stage is thus a multi-dimensional vector characterizing the buyer's valuations of the items at that stage and is assumed to be stage-wise independent. In particular, we propose a novel class of <b>mechanisms</b> called bank <b>account</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Roughly, a bank <b>account</b> <b>mechanism</b> is no different from any stage-wise individual mechanism except for an augmented structure called bank account, a real number for each node that summarizes the history so far. We first establish that the optimal revenue from any dynamic mechanism in this setting can be achieved by a bank <b>account</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and we provide a simple characterization of the set of incentive compatible and ex-post individually rational bank <b>account</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Based on these characterizations, we then investigate the problem of finding the (approximately) optimal bank <b>account</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> We prove that there exists a simple, randomized bank <b>account</b> <b>mechanism</b> that approximates optimal revenue up to a constant factor. Our result is general and can accommodate previous approximation results in single-shot multi-dimensional mechanism design. Based on the previous mechanism, we further show that there exists a deterministic bank <b>account</b> <b>mechanism</b> that achieves constant-factor approximation as well. Finally, we consider the problem of computing optimal mechanisms when the type space is discrete and provide an FPTAS via linear and dynamic programming...|$|R

40|$|For {{the design}} of {{distributed}} work systems like P 2 P filesharing networks {{it is essential to}} provide incentives for agents to work for each other rather than free ride. Several mechanisms have been proposed to achieve this goal, including currency systems, credit networks, and <b>accounting</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> It has proven particularly challenging to provide robustness to sybil attacks, i. e., attacks where an agent creates and controls multiple false identities. In this paper, we consider <b>accounting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for domains in which (1) transactions cannot be bound to reports, (2) transactions are bilateral and private, and (3) agents can only form trust links upon successful work interactions. Our results reveal the trade-off one must make in designing such mechanisms. We show that <b>accounting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> with a strong form of transitive trust cannot be robust against strongly beneficial sybil attacks. However, we also present a mechanism that strikes a balance, providing a weaker form of transitive trust while also being robust against the strongest form of sybil attacks. On the one hand, our results highlight the role of strong social ties in providing robustness against sybil attacks (such as those leveraged in credit networks using bilateral IOUs), {{and on the other hand}} our results show what kind of robustness properties are possible and impossible in domains where such pre-existing trust relations do not exist...|$|E

40|$|My diploma thesis {{focuses on}} the M&A {{transaction}} closing mechanisms. Their function is to reflect the value changes of the target company into the purchase price. Value change occurs during the time lag between {{the date of the}} financial statements and the date of the transaction closing. Throughout history, there have been two major approaches developed. The "Completion Accounts Mechanism" uses post-completion price adjustments to reflect the change of the net working capital and net debt during the interim period. The "Locked Box Mechanism", using fixed price, assures non-fluctuation of target value in the interim period by imposing strict restrictions on the seller's activities. In this research, I have analyzed 44 transactions closed in the Czech Republic. I have challenged the theoretical foundations and described the application of the mechanisms in practice. At the end, I have compared the Czech and European practices. Thesis findings: 1. All the theoretical features of the mechanisms were proven by an analyzed sample of closed transactions. The completion <b>accounts</b> <b>mechanism</b> is buyer-friendly, while the locked box is a seller-friendly mechanism. 2. The main driver in mechanism selection is bargaining power. Buyers were in a better negotiating position in 69 % of the completion account transactions. On the contrary, the sellers had bargaining power in 100 % of the locked box transactions. 3. The Czech Republic is an environment where buyers (big multinational companies) dominate. They have preferred the completion <b>account</b> <b>mechanism</b> that provides them with higher protection from value leakage or other risks associated with small CEE economies.

To reduce a network’s vulnerability, the effort should not be restricted to a firewall as a single point of network traffic control.

40|$|In recent years, multi-threaded {{processors}} {{have become}} more and more popular in industry in order to increase the system aggregated performance and per-application performance, overcoming the limitations imposed by the limited instruction-level parallelism, and by power and thermal constraints. Multi-threaded processors are widely used in servers, desktop computers, lap-tops, and mobile devices. However, multi-threaded processors introduce complexities when accounting CPU (computation) capacity (CPU accounting), since the CPU capacity accounted to an application not only depends upon the time that the application is scheduled onto a CPU, but also on the amount of hardware resources it receives during that period. And given that in a multi-threaded processor hardware resources are dynamically shared between applications, the CPU capacity accounted to an application in a multi-threaded processor depends upon the workload in which it executes. This is inconvenient because the CPU accounting of the same application with the same input data set may be accounted significantly different depending upon the workload in which it executes. Deploying systems with accurate CPU <b>accounting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is necessary to increase fairness among running applications. Moreover, it will allow users to be fairly charged on a shared data center, facilitating server consolidation in future systems. This Thesis analyses the concepts of CPU capacity and CPU accounting for multi-threaded processors.

40|$|Processor {{architectures}} combining several paradigms of Thread-Level Parallelism (TLP), such as CMP processors {{in which}} each core is SMT, {{are becoming more and}} more popular as a way to improve performance at a moderate cost. However, the complex interaction between running tasks in hardware shared resources in multi-TLP architectures introduces complexities when accounting CPU time (or CPU utilization) to tasks. The CPU utilization accounted to a task depends on both the time it runs in the processor and the amount of processor hardware resources it receives. Deploying systems with accurate CPU <b>accounting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is necessary to increase fairness. Moreover, it will allow users to be fairly charged on a shared data center, facilitating server consolidation in future systems. In this article we analyze the accuracy and hardware cost of previous CPU <b>accounting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for pure-CMP and pure-SMT processors and we show that they are not adequate for CMP+SMT processors. Consequently, we propose a new accounting mechanism for CMP+SMT processors which: (1) increases the accuracy of accounted CPU utilization; (2) provides much more stable results over a wide range of processor setups; and (3) does not require tracking all hardware shared resources, significantly reducing its implementation cost. In particular, previous proposals lead to inaccuracies between 21 % and 79 % when measuring CPU utilization in an 8 -core 2 -way SMT processor, while our proposal reduces this inaccuracy t...|$|E
