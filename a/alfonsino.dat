Many of the coins that reached the Philippines came {{because of the}} Manila Galleon which dominated trade for the next 250 years. These were brought across the Pacific Ocean in exchange for odd-shaped silver cobs, which are also known as macuquinas. Other coins that followed were the dos mundos or pillar dollars in silver, the counterstamped coins and the portrait series, also in silver.|$|E

The fish used in the traditional cuisine are divided in two categories, the [...] "poor" [...] fish (sardine, ray, mackerel, and others) and the [...] "wealthy" [...] fish (such as whiting, snook, and <b>alfonsino).</b> The most famous local dish is Pescada à Poveira (Poveira Whiting), whose main ingredients are, along with the fish that gives the name to the dish, potatoes, eggs and a boiled onion and tomato sauce. Other fishery dishes include the Arroz de Sardinha (sardine rice), Caldeirada de Peixe (fish stew), Lulas Recheadas à Poveiro (Poveiro stuffed squids), Arroz de Marisco (seafood rice) and Lagosta Suada (steamed spiny lobster). Shellfish and boiled iscas, pataniscas, and bolinhos de bacalhau are popular snacks. Other dishes include Feijoada Poveira, made with white beans and served with dry rice (arroz seco); and Francesinha Poveira made in long bread that first appeared in 1962 as fast food for holidaymakers.|$|E

25|$|Rodezno’s {{leadership}} {{was marked by}} rapprochement strategy towards the <b>Alfonsinos,</b> exercised by means of alliances within Acción Popular, Renovación Española and Bloque Nacional, but not within CEDA; its objective was sort of dynastical union on Traditionalist platform. Though always consulted with the claimant it was popular only among the party professional politicians; among the rank-and-file it first caused grumblings and then increasingly open protest against mixing with “debris of the fallen liberal monarchy”. When sitting in executive bodies of the organizations mentioned, Rodezno and Pradera were getting detached from the mainstream Carlist feeling.|$|R
25|$|Though Rodezno’s {{supporters}} {{complained about}} “fascistización” of the Communion {{under the new}} leadership of Fal, Carlism firmly changed course from political negotiations to organizational build-up.

Among these, the Carlists stood out, who politically dominated the province, and resented an increased string of rulings and laws passed by Madrid, as well as left leaning influences. Unlike Biscay or Gipuzkoa, Navarre did not develop manufacturing during this period, remaining a basically rural economy.|$|R

5000|$|Talks {{with the}} Alfonsists {{proved to be}} {{definitely}} more difficult. Though the deposed Alfonso XIII and Jaime III (represented not by Villores, but by José María Gomez de Pujadas) seemed to agree a vague dynastical compromise, its version edited by de Villores {{was rejected by the}} <b>Alfonsinos.</b> Another royal agreement, known as [...] "pacto de Territet", was greeted with ice-cold welcome among the Carlists. By that time de Villores, for months suffering from deteriorating health, was already unable {{to take part in the}} debate. His funeral in May 1932 proved to be another opportunity for public display of rapidly swelling Carlist zeal across a few cities in Spain.|$|R
50|$|The splendid <b>alfonsino</b> is the {{far more}} studied species of Beryx, but the alfonsino's biology {{is very similar to}} that of its congener. Alfonsinos are benthopelagic and {{aggregate}} over deep-ocean seamounts, typically near deep-sea corals. At night, they migrate vertically into shallower waters. Their primary food sources are crustaceans, cephalopods, and small fish, with the last being the most abundant prey in its diet. In this it is quite dissimilar from the splendid <b>alfonsino,</b> which appears to have a slower digestion and wider dietary breadth.|$|E
5000|$|There is “another explanation, less sensational {{but more}} plausible,” for the {{presence}} of this infant soul. Gesualdo’s second son, born on January 20, 1595, from his marriage to Eleonora d’Este, named <b>Alfonsino</b> in homage to the Duke of Ferrare, Alfonso d’Este, died on October 22, 1600, “dealing a fatal blow to the conjugal relations of the princely couple.” According to Glenn Watkins, “we see a child understandably identified by many as <b>Alfonsino,</b> … now somewhat unusually provided with wings and rising from the flames of purgatory.” ...|$|E

25|$|By many Carlists Bau {{was viewed}} with suspicion. This {{was due to}} his enthusiasm when {{engaging}} in alliance talks with the <b>Alfonsinos</b> and personal friendship with their leader, José Calvo Sotelo; though new Traditionalist jefe Manuel Fal approached Bloque Nacional as tactical option to be eventually abandoned, Bau was suspected of pushing for a dynastical compromise. In the spring of 1935 Don Alfonso Carlos and Fal considered Bau’s activity in the Bloque intolerable and semi-rebellious. Also present-day scholars name his position as “conspiration”, while others claim that he was loyal to Calvo rather than to Traditionalism. However, {{he was allowed to}} speak at massive Carlist meetings in Poblet and at Montserrat; he was also appointed to the Carlist Council of Economy.|$|R
25|$|During {{the early}} months of the Republic Comín emerged as engaged in a number of Jaimist {{initiatives}} going far beyond the regional realm and with major nationwide impact. In June 1931 he contributed to reformatting of Requeté from a self-defense militia to a paramilitary formation; more importantly, in the autumn of that year and with a group of senior Carlist leaders he took part in preliminary talks with the Alfonsist politicians, intended as preparations for a would-be dynastical agreement. Fully authorized by Don Jaime, they met with the <b>Alfonsinos</b> in San Sebastián, leading later to the so-called Pacto de Territet. Comín's stance on dynastical agreement is not clear; later that year he was noted as speaking against any common monarchist movement, including sort of a monarchist shirt organization.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s Don Javier firmly {{abandoned}} any thought of reconciliation with the <b>Alfonsinos</b> and instructed harsh measures versus those who approached them; however, he remained respectful towards Don Juan and avoided open challenge, still falling short of explicitly claiming the title. He supported Valiente – his position gradually reinforced formally {{up to new}} Jefe Delegado in 1958-1960 - in attempts to eradicate internal focos of rebellion against collaboration and to combat new openly secessionist anti-collaborative groups. Though 20 years earlier he expelled from the Comunión those who had accepted seats in the Francoist structures, {{at the turn of}} the decades Don Javier viewed the appointment of 5 Carlists to the Cortes as success of the collaborationist policy, especially that the regime permitted new Carlist legal outposts and the movement seemed visibly reinvigorated, now openly present in the public discourse.|$|R
5000|$|Always in ill health, {{he married}} his cousin Marfisa d'Este (illegitimate {{daughter}} of Francesco d'Este {{and five years}} Alfonsino's senior) on 5 May 1578 - her father had died in February that year and the will had stated <b>Alfonsino</b> would only come into his inheritance if he married {{a member of the}} Este family. Torquato Tasso wrote his [...] "Già il notturno sereno" [...] (poem, book II, from October 1565 to 11 March 1579). in honour of the wedding. <b>Alfonsino,</b> however, died just under four months after the wedding but Marfisa continued {{to take part in the}} court festivities despite also being in mourning. On 3 January 1580 she remarried to Alderano Cybo-Malaspina, hereditary prince of Massa and Carrara.|$|E
50|$|Chile is {{currently}} the world’s largest producer of farmed salmon and has a burgeoning mussel culture industry that is supplying a growing world market. Other fisheries of interest include <b>alfonsino,</b> anchovies, cod, cuttlefish, hake, mackerel, ray, sardines, sea bream, squid, and swordfish.|$|E
50|$|Alfonsinos are {{economically}} important fish, {{targeted by}} commercial fisheries, including seamount fisheries, that employ deep-water trawling and longline fishing methods to catch them. It is of import to fisheries in Spain and Mauritania {{in the eastern}} Atlantic, the southeastern United States in the western Atlantic, and Japan, La Reunion Island, and the Canary Islands in the Indo-Pacific. It is also captured as bycatch of fisheries targeting the splendid <b>alfonsino,</b> though capture data likely does not distinguish between the two. This has led to concerns that stocks may be more depleted than previously thought. Of all Beryx species, the splendid <b>alfonsino</b> is the most commonly caught, but B. decadactylus makes up 95% of all Beryx catches off the southeastern United States.|$|E
25|$|In 1943 Sivatte co-signed Reclamación de Poder, a {{document}} which demanded from Franco dismantling of national-sindicalist regime and introduction of Traditionalist monarchy. This {{was his last}} action within the party executive. Increasingly perplexed by contacts with the <b>Alfonsinos</b> and fearing some sort of dynastic compromise, as means of protest in 1944 Sivatte resigned from Junta Nacional Carlista, though he retained his post of the Catalan jefe. He was also concerned with what he perceived as Carlist lack of direction, political bewilderment and especially the inactive regency of Don Javier. In a late 1945 document he firmly denied dynastic rights to Don Juan and Don Carlos Pio and recommended that the regent assumes a bold and decisive stand; other documents soon followed. Executing his strategy, Sivatte co-engineered a grand Carlist demonstration in Pamplona in December 1945; the event ended in riots and detentions.|$|R
40|$|Important {{reproduction}} {{aspects of}} six demersal species from Azores were studied: red (blackspot) seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo), bluemouth (Helicolenus daclylopterus), two <b>alfonsinos</b> (Beryx splendens and Beryx decadac~lus), yellow-orange scorpionfish (Pontinus kuhlii) and silver scabbardfish (Lepidopus caudatus). Sex ratios were calculated and tested by chi-square analysis. In {{order to determine}} the size at first maturity, maturation ogives were estimated using Logistic or Gompertz models. The gonadosomatic index was determined for those species for which the reproductive period was not well known. The ratio of males to females was significantly different (p< 0. 05) from 1 :l for all species: P. bogaraveo (1 : 0. 20), H. dactylopterus (1 : 0. 86), B. splendens (1 : 1. 25), B. decadactylus (1 : 1. 38), P. kuhlii (l : 1. 75) and L. calrdatus (1 : 1. 74).

5000|$|Following {{unexpected}} {{death of}} Don Jaime Bilbao dashed any doubts {{he might have}} had and together with Pradera he led the Mellistas into the united Carlist organization, Comunión Tradicionalista, becoming head of its Biscay section and joining the national Junta Suprema. He forged close working relation with the new claimant, Don Alfonso Carlos, co-editing a number of his proclamations and documents, including those which seemed to confirm the late Don Jaime's policy of opening dynastical negotiations with the <b>Alfonsinos.</b> Himself he was also inclined towards a dynastical pact and is listed as one of the so-called [...] "transaccionistas". He engaged in the monarchist alliance and contributed to Acción Española. Some sources claim he joined the manifesto launching a new broad alliance, Bloque Nacional, while other authors maintain {{he was one of the}} few leaders who did not sign.|$|R
50|$|The <b>alfonsino</b> has large {{eyes and}} a deep, {{compressed}} body, 1.9-2.5 times its standard length at the greatest depth. It is a rose red color dorsally and orange ventrally. The rest of its body is silvery-pink, and the breast is yellow-white in color. Fins and {{the inside of the}} mouth are bright red. The anal fin is distinctly larger than in many fish species and its caudal fin is deeply forked. Its bright red color is a common adaptation to deepwater surroundings, where red is filtered out of the light spectrum. Although the most common size is 35.0 cm, it can reach lengths of up to 100.0 cm TL. The maximum published weight for an <b>alfonsino</b> is 2.5 kg. Juveniles have heavy head spines, while adults do not.|$|E

25|$|In April 1956 the Sivattistas {{met with}} Don Javier in Perpignan. The latter agreed {{to sign a}} {{document}} rejecting any dynastic compromise with the <b>Alfonsinos</b> and with Franco, {{though he did not}} agree to sign as a king and afterwards insisted on keeping the document private. Sivatte, fearing another reverse step, refused; moreover, he presented the declaration at Junta Suprema de las Regiones, a freshly formed and somewhat rebellious Carlist body bent on preventing a pro-Juanista and pro-Francoist turn. The intention was to keep Don Javier in a crystal box and to separate him from daily political business, but the new Carlist political leader José María Valiente mounted a counter-offensive and forced dissolution of the Junta. Sivatte responded by publishing the Perpignan paper as Manifesto a los españoles. At that point he was already convinced that loyalty to Don Javier reached a dead end and that a competitive solution is needed.|$|R
5000|$|As Don Javier soon backtracked on the {{so-called}} Acto de Barcelona and Franco's regime {{showed no signs of}} cracking, the non-collaborative policy of the Falcondistas was increasingly looking like a dead end street. The so-called [...] "duros" [...] advocated a decisive anti-Francoist course, {{the so-called}} [...] "unionistas" [...] opted for rapprochement towards the regime and possibly a dynastical accord with <b>Alfonsinos,</b> some in the party called for a [...] "tercera vía" [...] and many complained about Fal’s [...] "estilo autoritario". Fal himself has run out of steam; in his July 1955 letter to Franco he seemed settled for the perspective of mere survival of Carlism. Though he remained in perfect understanding with Don Javier and until that moment the terms [...] "Falcondistas" [...] and [...] "Javieristas" [...] were used interchangeably, also the Carlist king felt that Carlism needed a new leader. In August 1955 Fal resigned as Jefe Delegado.|$|R
25|$|As provincial {{deputy leader}} Sivatte focused on Requeté buildup and {{propaganda}} activities, occasionally replacing Alier during Carlist gatherings. On {{the national level}} he displayed his already trademark intransigence speaking against an alliance with the <b>Alfonsinos,</b> advocated {{by the likes of}} conde Rodezno and Pradera. Following the Popular Front triumph he represented Catalan Carlism during talks with local UME leaders, drafting first plans of anti-Republican insurgency. One of them was almost put into action in the spring of 1936; when recalled in the very last minute, Sivatte formed part of the Catalan Requeté command. According to one source, it was Sivatte who suggested that Alier, who resigned early that year, be replaced as regional jefe by Tomàs Caylà. The new leader entrusted Sivatte with the task of collecting funds for anticipated military action. He also went on negotiating with UME and was unhappy about their vision; the generals imagined the coup to topple the frentepopulista government, while Sivatte intended to topple the Republic.|$|R
