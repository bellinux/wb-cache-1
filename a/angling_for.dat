5|$|In November 1888, Karim {{was given}} four months' leave {{to return to}} India, during which time he visited his father. Karim wrote to Victoria that his father, who was due to retire, had hopes of a pension and that his former employer, John Tyler, was <b>angling</b> <b>for</b> promotion. As a result, {{throughout}} {{the first six months}} of 1889, Victoria wrote to the Viceroy of India, Lord Lansdowne, demanding action on Waziruddin's pension and Tyler's promotion. The Viceroy was reluctant to pursue the issues because Waziruddin had told the local governor, Sir Auckland Colvin, that he desired only gratitude and also because Tyler had a reputation for tactless behaviour and bad-tempered remarks.|$|E
5|$|Harrison had {{developed}} {{his foreign policy}} based largely on Blaine’s ideas, and {{at the start of}} his term, Harrison and Blaine had very similar views on the United States' place in the world. In spite of their shared worldview, however, the two men became personally unfriendly as the term went on. Harrison was conscious that his Secretary of State was more popular than he, and while he admired Blaine’s gift for diplomacy, he grew displeased with Blaine’s frequent absence from his post because of illness, and suspected that Blaine was <b>angling</b> <b>for</b> the presidential nomination in 1892. Harrison tried to limit how many “Blaine men” filled subordinate positions in the State Department and denied Blaine’s request that his son, Walker, be appointed First Assistant Secretary, instead naming him Solicitor of the Department of State. Despite the growing personal rancor, the two men continued, with one exception, to agree on the foreign policy questions of the day.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to propose a new {{computer}} based method <b>for</b> measuring acetabular <b>angles</b> on hip radiographs and to assess its practicality, sensitivity and reliability <b>for</b> acetabular <b>angle</b> measurement. Methods: A total of 314 acetabulum were assessed on 157 pelvic X-ray images. Acetabular angles were measured with both the conventional method (Method 1) and our proposed method (Method 2). All the Acetabular Index (AI) angle, Acetabular Angle (AA) and Acetabular Center (ACM) angle were measured with both methods. Results: The mean AI <b>angle</b> <b>for</b> Method 1 is 11. 02 ° ± 2. 7 ° and the mean AI <b>angle</b> <b>for</b> Method 2 is 10. 08 ° ±  1. 88 °, the mean AA <b>angle</b> <b>for</b> Method 1 is 39. 5 ° ± 5. 3 ° and the mean AA <b>angle</b> <b>for</b> Method 2 is 39. 36 ° ± 4. 68 °, the mean ACM <b>angle</b> <b>for</b> Method 1 is 50. 5 ° ± 6. 01 ° and the mean ACM <b>angle</b> <b>for</b> Method 2 is 55. 42 ° ± 12. 43 °.

25|$|Virgin {{had long}} been <b>angling</b> <b>for</b> a {{franchise}} extension in return for ordering extra carriages for the Class 390 Pendolinos. The Department for Transport rejected this and instead placed an order itself with Alstom for 106 carriages allowing for four complete eleven-carriage sets and 31 sets to be extended by two carriages. There was an option to extend the remaining 21 sets but this was allowed to lapse. The four new sets were delivered in 2010/12 while 31 sets are currently receiving extra carriages with all to be complete by December 2012. This has required a number of stations to have platforms lengthened.|$|E

25|$|It was rumoured that Robertson was <b>angling</b> <b>for</b> Haig’s job in July, {{although}} there is no clear evidence that this was so. This was the month with the highest British casualties of the entire war, {{at a time when the}} German Verdun Offensive was already being scaled back. Haig was reluctant to send Robertson full weekly reports and Robertson complained that Haig’s daily telegrams to him contained little more information than the daily press releases. “Not exactly the letter of a CIGS! … He ought to take responsibility also!” was Haig’s comment on one such letter (29 July). F.E. Smith (1 August) circulated a paper by his friend Winston Churchill (then out of office), criticising the high losses and negligible gains of the Somme. Churchill argued that this would leave Germany freer to win victories elsewhere. Robertson issued a strong rebuttal the same day, arguing that Britain’s losses were small compared to what France had suffered in previous years, that Germany had had to quadruple the number of her divisions on the Somme sector and that this had taken pressure off Verdun and contributed to the success of Russian and Italian offensives. After the Churchill memorandum, both Robertson and Esher wrote to Haig reminding him of how Robertson was covering Haig’s back in London, Robertson reminding Haig of the need to give him “the necessary data with which to reply to the swines” (7 and 8 August).|$|E
500|$|Cutthroat trout are prized as a gamefish, {{particularly}} by fly anglers. They are regulated as a gamefish {{in every state}} and province they occur in.

500|$|One {{evening in}} January 1842, Virginia showed {{the first signs}} of consumption, now known as tuberculosis, while singing and playing the piano. Poe {{described}} it as breaking a blood vessel in her throat. She only partially recovered. Poe began to drink more heavily under the stress of Virginia's illness. He left Graham's and attempted to find a new position, for a time <b>angling</b> <b>for</b> a government post. He returned to New York where he worked briefly at the Evening Mirror before becoming editor of the Broadway Journal and, later, sole owner. There he alienated himself from other writers by publicly accusing Henry Wadsworth Longfellow of plagiarism, though Longfellow never responded. On January 29, 1845, his poem [...] "The Raven" [...] appeared in the Evening Mirror and became a popular sensation. It made Poe a household name almost instantly, though he was paid only $9 for its publication. It was concurrently published in [...] under the pseudonym [...] "Quarles".|$|E
500|$|Beauregard {{traveled}} by steamship from New York to New Orleans and immediately began giving military {{advice to the}} local authorities, which included further strengthening Forts St. Philip and Jackson, which guarded the Mississippi approaches to New Orleans. He hoped to be named commander of the state army, but was disappointed that the state legislature appointed Braxton Bragg. Aware that Beauregard might resent him, Bragg offered him the rank of colonel. Instead Beauregard enrolled as a private in the [...] "Orleans Guards", a battalion of French Creole aristocrats. At the same time, he communicated with Slidell and the newly chosen President Davis, <b>angling</b> <b>for</b> a senior position in the new Confederate States Army. Rumors that Beauregard would be placed {{in charge of the}} entire Army infuriated Bragg. Concerned about the political situation regarding the Federal presence at Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, Davis selected Beauregard to take command of Charleston's defenses. Beauregard seemed the perfect combination of military engineer and charismatic Southern leader needed at that time and place.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Angling</b> <b>for</b> crappie {{is popular}} {{throughout}} much of North America. Methods vary, but {{among the most popular}} is called [...] "spider rigging", a method characterized by a fisherman in a boat with many long fishing rods pointing away from the angler at various angles like spokes from a wheel. Anglers who employ the spider rigging method may choose from among many popular baits. Some of the most popular are plastic jigs with lead jig heads, crankbaits or live minnows. Many anglers also chum or dump live bait into the water to attract the fish to bite their bait. Crappies are also regularly targeted and caught during the spawning period by fly fishermen, and can be taken from frozen ponds and lakes in winter by ice fishing.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{they have}} very sharp and {{numerous}} teeth, care is required in unhooking a pike. Barbless trebles are recommended when <b>angling</b> <b>for</b> this species, as they simplify unhooking. This is undertaken using long forceps, with 30-cm artery clamps the ideal tool. When holding the pike from below on the lower jaw, it will open its mouth. It should be {{kept out of the}} water for the minimum amount of time possible, and should be given extra time to recover if being weighed and photographed before release. If practicing live release, calling the fish [...] "caught" [...] when it is alongside a boat is recommended. Remove the hook by grabbing it with needle-nosed pliers while the fish is still submerged and giving it a flip in the direction that turns the hook out of the mouth. This avoids damage to the fish and the stress of being out of water.|$|E

The U.S. Army was <b>angling</b> <b>for</b> its own organic air power within its ranks, à la the U.S. Marines. When the U.S. Navy and Marines pointed out the utility of air strikes landing as close as artillery fire to protect friendly troops, the Air Force countered that the Marines had to use air strikes because they lacked artillery in amphibious assaults. The Air Force pledged trained fighter pilots as forward air controllers (FACs) to direct a joint CAS operation; the Army was tasked with supplying radio equipment, vehicles, and personnel for these Tactical Air Control Parties (TACP). This led to another point of disagreement. The Army claimed it should have input into the types of aircraft used in close air support strikes, and plumped for propeller-driven planes; the Air Force claimed the right to develop its weaponry unimpeded, and intended to develop jets into CAS aircraft.|$|E
