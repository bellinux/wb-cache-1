5|$|After {{the battle}} on the {{southern}} side of the Shangani was over, Forbes and his column conducted <b>a</b> <b>cursory</b> search for survivors from Wilson's party, but, unable to cross the river, could see nothing {{to tell them what}} had happened. Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress at every turn.|$|E
5|$|It {{is carried}} out in the manner of an {{informal}} enquiry, using a combination of open and closed questions, supplemented by structured tests to assess cognition. The MSE can also be considered part of the comprehensive physical examination performed by physicians and nurses although it may be performed in <b>a</b> <b>cursory</b> and abbreviated way in non-mental-health settings. Information is usually recorded as free-form text using the standard headings, but brief MSE checklists are available for use in emergency situations, for example by paramedics or emergency department staff.|$|E
5|$|Singapore's Foreign Ministry {{said that}} a team {{including}} Attorney-General Lucien Wong, and Chan Sek Keong, S. Jayakumar and Tommy Koh (who had represented Singapore at the original ICJ hearing), had been appointed to study {{and respond to the}} claim. On 5 February 2017, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam commented that on <b>a</b> <b>cursory</b> examination of the documents without detailed legal advice, he did not see how the documents would make any difference to the ICJ's judgment.|$|E

5|$|Spirits {{were high}} during the unit's brief {{training}} period {{as the men}} enjoyed playing sports, observing the country scenery and experiencing the night-life of the nearby capital. They were not adequately trained, receiving only a basic medical examination, a few days' fitness training and <b>a</b> <b>cursory</b> explanation of proper conduct in the bush. They expressed surprise when instructed to paint stripes of camouflage green on their weapons and combat boots in the Rhodesian fashion, having never before {{heard of such a}} practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} called a masterpiece depiction of a battle scene, and much more than a simple depiction of a bloody battle. It is a complex picture, requiring more than <b>a</b> <b>cursory</b> look; a French critic, viewing it in Paris in 1879, declared that it was a museum in its own right, requiring eight days of study before one could properly appreciate it. At the same time, critics have pointed to the unrealistic depiction of the battle, and some anachronistic accessories present in the painting. Others have criticized the painting for being too crowded and chaotic.|$|E
5|$|Conwell {{arrived in}} Philadelphia on December 2, 1820. The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy that preceded Conwell's arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, William Hogan, {{approached}} de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia. After only <b>a</b> <b>cursory</b> investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan {{was assigned to}} St. Mary's Church. Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy. Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already {{moved out of the}} priests' residence at Old St. Joseph's Church to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.|$|E

5|$|New Hampshire {{conducted}} training {{exercises in}} the Atlantic and Caribbean through late 1910. On 1 November that year, she steamed out of Hampton Roads with the Second Battleship Division for a visit to Europe. There, the ships stopped in Cherbourg, France and Weymouth, the United Kingdom. The Division departed Weymouth on 30 December {{and returned to the}} Caribbean for training, before proceeding to Norfolk on 10 March 1911. On 2122 March, New Hampshire conducted gunnery training with the target ship San Marcosthe old battleship in Tangier Sound in Chesapeake Bay. Over the course of the two days of firing, New Hampshire inflicted severe damage to the old ship, sinking her in shallow water. <b>A</b> <b>cursory</b> inspection of the wreck noted that the interior of the ship above the waterline was destroyed and that she had been holed multiple times below the waterline.|$|E
5|$|Singapore's Foreign Ministry {{said that}} a team {{including}} Attorney-General Lucien Wong, and Chan Sek Keong, S.

Shanmugam commented that on <b>a</b> <b>cursory</b> examination of the documents without detailed legal advice, he did not see how the documents would make any difference to the ICJ's judgment. On 2 March, Foreign Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said in Parliament that the Singapore legal team has studied Malaysia’s application carefully, including the three documents relied on by Malaysia to support its application, and strongly believes that the documents relied on by Malaysia do not satisfy the criteria under Article 61. Singapore has until 14 June to submit to the ICJ its comprehensive and compelling rebuttal to Malaysia’s application.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew was}} {{likewise}} {{unprepared for the}} emergency, as lifeboat training had been minimal. Only one lifeboat drill had been conducted while the ship was docked at Southampton. It was <b>a</b> <b>cursory</b> effort, consisting of two boats being lowered, each manned by one officer and four men who merely rowed around the dock {{for a few minutes}} before returning to the ship. The boats were supposed to be stocked with emergency supplies, but Titanics passengers later found that they had only been partially provisioned despite the efforts of the ship's chief baker, Charles Joughin, and his staff to do so. No lifeboat or fire drills had been conducted since Titanic left Southampton. A lifeboat drill had been scheduled for the Sunday morning before the ship sank, but was cancelled for unknown reasons by Captain Smith.|$|E
60|$|AS IN {{the last}} few chapters, several matters {{connected}} with the general condition of the natives have been incidentally touched upon, it may be well not to leave so important a subject in a state calculated to convey erroneous impressions. Let us bestow upon it, therefore, something more than <b>a</b> mere <b>cursory</b> glance.|$|R
60|$|To her mind, it was <b>a</b> very <b>cursory</b> {{examination}} that he made; and {{the upshot}} of his opinion, triumphantly accepted by Mrs. Merrifield, {{was that there was}} nothing seriously amiss with the child, that she only needed care, regularity and bracing, and that the stifling, gasping spasms were simply the effect of hysteria.|$|R
60|$|We know-and {{all people}} know-so many {{specimens}} of this class, that in selecting the few heads our limits {{enable us to}} take from a great number, we have been induced to give the very friendly young gentleman the preference over many others, to whose claims upon <b>a</b> more <b>cursory</b> view of the question we had felt disposed to assign the priority.|$|R
5|$|The {{matter is}} {{complicated}} by the difficulties Mulder and Scully have with dealing with the Native American population, stemming from the experience of the locals with the FBI at the Wounded Knee incident in 1973. Goodensnake's sister Gwen is also bitter that her neighbors are too frightened of native legends to confront his death. Despite these misgivings, the agents find a seeming ally in Sheriff Charles Tskany, who permits Scully to make <b>a</b> <b>cursory</b> examination of Goodensnake's body, but forbids a full autopsy. They discover that he had elongated canines, similar to those of an animal, and bears long-healed scars similar to those borne by Lyle. After parting ways with the Sheriff, Scully asks Mulder why it seems he is expecting every piece of evidence they have come across. Mulder informs Scully that forty years previously there was a similar incident in the area, which was investigated by J. Edgar Hoover and became the FBI's first X-File case.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>cursory</b> {{proposal}} for constitutional reform was {{presented by the}} NRP in 1999, but the issue was not prominent in the 2006 election campaign and it appears a detailed proposal {{has yet to be}} worked out and agreed upon within the party.|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> very <b>cursory</b> {{test program}} was {{performed}} to evaluate the feasibility of using a 100 W CO 2 laser to initiate resonant oscillations in a test combustor. GOX/RP- 1 were selected as propellants due to the absorption characteristics of RP- 1 and due to test facility capabilities. Very low amplitude oscillations were initiated during laser pulsing that correspond to the first longitudinal mode of the test engine...|$|R
5000|$|The {{title is}} derived from [...] "Cook's Tour", a British idiomatic phrase meaning <b>a</b> brief or <b>cursory</b> guide to <b>a</b> subject or place. Its origin is in the trips {{organized}} by Thomas Cook in the 19th century.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{political}} saliency of employment, the growing scholarly literature on financial centers contains only <b>a</b> few <b>cursory</b> estimates of employment in international banking. We use simple methods {{to calculate the}} total and marginal direct employment effects of Panama's International Banking Center. The results, which appear reasonable, suggest that international banking activities are not very labor intensive and provide even fewer jobs than many observers infer from the relatively impressive asset amounts involved...|$|R
25|$|Lamarck gave a {{detailed}} description of the species that he named Gastonia cutispongia. He named another species, but gave it only <b>a</b> <b>cursory</b> description. No one today is really sure of what the other species was. Some authors believe that it was not even a member of Araliaceae.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem is}} twofold. There have been short {{chapters}} on sports announcing included in most broadcasting textbooks.

60|$|There was {{a shrill}} squeal, a flutter of white, and a neat pair of button boots waving in the air.

He took the outraged damsel by the hand, and led her, howling lustily, in to the horrified Ann.|$|R

25|$|It {{was decided}} that Armenian revolutionaries carry out the verdict. Talaat was assassinated with a single bullet on 15 March 1921 as {{he came out of}} his house in Hardenbergstrasse, Charlottenburg. His assassin was an Armenian Revolutionary Federation member from Erzurum named Soghomon Tehlirian. Soghomon Tehlirian {{admitted}} committing the shooting, but after <b>a</b> <b>cursory</b> two-day trial, he was found innocent by a German court on grounds of temporary insanity because of the traumatic experience he had gone through during the genocide.|$|E
25|$|Two police {{officers}} {{responded to the}} 911 call and arrived at the Ramsey home within three minutes. They conducted <b>a</b> <b>cursory</b> search of the house but {{did not find any}} sign of a break-in or forced entry. John made arrangements to pay the ransom. A forensics team was dispatched to the house. Believing that the case was a kidnapping, only JonBenét's bedroom was cordoned off to prevent contamination of evidence. There was no process taken to prevent contamination of evidence {{in the rest of the}} house.|$|E
5000|$|The Inner Chapters {{have one}} {{complete}} translation by James R. Ware (1966), {{which also includes}} Ge Hong's autobiography from Outer Chapter 50 (1966:6-21). Several reviewers censured the quality of Ware's translation, for instance, Kroll (1982:139) called it [...] "at times misguided". Huard's and Wong's (1968) critical assessment of Ware was criticized in turn by Sivin (1969:388). [...] "Their review, nonetheless, {{can only be described}} as perfunctory. Only the forematter and endmatter of Ware's book are evaluated, and that in <b>a</b> curiously <b>cursory</b> fashion." ...|$|R
50|$|Of the Benedictine Abingdon Abbey {{there remains}} a {{beautiful}} Perpendicular gateway (common local knowledge, however, {{is that it was}} actually rebuilt out of the rubble of the original, and <b>a</b> little <b>cursory</b> examination of the patternation of the stonework will apparently divulge this) and ruins of buildings such as the mainly Early English prior's house, the guest house and other fragments. Other remains from the former abbey include the Unicorn Theatre and Long Gallery, which are still used for plays and functions including an annual craft fair.|$|R
5000|$|George Pacheco, in About.com, {{described}} Grim Scary Tales as [...] "more of {{a novelty}} than anything else, despite the band's crisp, thrash riffs and steamroller rhythms" [...] and suggested the album [...] "isn't really {{worth more than}} <b>a</b> few <b>cursory,</b> curious spins at best". [...] Allmusic's Phil Freeman was also ambivalent about the album, suggesting that [...] "longtime Macabre fans, who find depth in the band's lyrical fixations, will doubtless be thrilled at their heroes' return. Most metalheads, and everyone else, can safely skip this one, though".|$|R
