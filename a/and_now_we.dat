His poems have been parodied many times, including with the books When We Were Rather Older <b>and</b> <b>Now</b> <b>We</b> Are Sixty. The 1963 film The King's Breakfast was based on Milne's poem of the same name.|$|E
25|$|Rosenzweig's major work is The Star of Redemption (first {{published}} in 1921). It is {{a description of}} the relationships between God, humanity, and the world, as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption. If one makes a diagram with God at the top, and the World and the Self below, the inter-relationships generate a Star of David map. He is critical of any attempt to replace actual human existence with an ideal. In Rosenzweig's scheme, revelation arises not in metaphysics but in the here <b>and</b> <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> are called to love God, and to do so is to return to the world, and that is redemption.|$|E
25|$|Science is a {{magnificent}} force, {{but it is}} not a teacher of morals. It can perfect machinery, but it adds no moral restraints to protect society from the misuse of the machine. It can also build gigantic intellectual ships, but it constructs no moral rudders for the control of storm-tossed human vessel. It not only fails to supply the spiritual element needed but some of its unproven hypotheses rob the ship of its compass and thus endanger its cargo. In war, science has proven itself an evil genius; it has made war more terrible than it ever was before. Man used to be content to slaughter his fellowmen on a single plane, the earth's surface. Science has taught him to go down into the water and shoot up from below and to go up into the clouds and shoot down from above, thus making the battlefield three times as bloody as it was before; but science does not teach brotherly love. Science has made war so hellish that civilization was about to commit suicide; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> are told that newly discovered instruments of destruction will make the cruelties of the late war seem trivial in comparison with the cruelties of wars that may come in the future. If civilization is to be saved from the wreckage threatened by intelligence not consecrated by love, it must be saved by the moral code of the meek and lowly Nazarene. His teachings, and His teachings alone, can solve the problems that vex the heart and perplex the world.|$|E

500|$|Some {{scientists}} now {{consider that the}} effects of global dimming have masked the effect of global warming to some extent and that resolving global dimming may therefore lead to increases in predictions of future temperature rise. According to Beate Liepert, [...] "We lived in a global warming plus a global dimming world <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> are taking out global dimming. So we end up with the global warming world, which will be much worse than we thought it will be, much hotter." [...] The magnitude of this masking effect is one of the central problems in climate change with significant implications for future climate changes and policy responses to global warming.|$|E
500|$|On 1 November, Benfica hosted Celtic; {{they scored}} two {{goals in the}} first 25 minutes and a third through Andrei Karyaka in the 90th minute, winning by the same margin they had lost in Glasgow. Santos was happy with the win, saying, [...] "We knew he had three 'finals' <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> have two. We are better now, with four points and closing in on Celtic." [...] Four days later, Benfica hosted [...] Beira-Mar for a Primeira Liga match. Benfica did not score until the second half, when in the 51st minute, Katsouranis headed in the match's first goal. Three minutes later, Petit scored the second and an own-goal from Beira-Mar made the score 3–0.|$|E

[...] However, Becky Bain of Idolator thought the [...] "pulsating dance song" [...] was underwhelming. [...] "We have to admit, we’re not bowled over by this one, which pretty much follows a standard, predictable dance-pop formula from the double shout-out at the start to the 'woosh'ing fade-out finish". However Bain also pointed out that current trends on the US Billboard Hot 100 were unpredictable, [...] "then again, since when has the Hot 100 shyed away from generic pop tunes we’ve heard over and over again?

500|$|Although Bruce had {{the largest}} {{transfer}} budget in the division made available to him, Birmingham made a slow start to the 2006–07 season in the Championship and, after a 1–0 defeat at home to Norwich City, the team's fifth consecutive match without a win, there were calls from fans and local journalists for the manager to be sacked. Bruce publicly accepted responsibility for the team's poor run and admitted that he feared for his job, but the team responded with a 1–0 victory over Derby County, and then recorded a further five consecutive league victories to be joint leaders of the league table by late November. On 29 April 2007, Birmingham secured promotion to the Premier League, with one match to play, by virtue of Derby County's 2–0 defeat at Crystal Palace. Chairman David Gold told the press [...] "There have been some dark days but Steve has been outstanding. He was determined to bounce back. He has rebuilt the team <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> are all back {{where we want to}} be." ...|$|E
500|$|When Taylor {{said the}} moves detracted from Hương and Suu's powers, the {{officers}} disagreed {{and said they}} supported the pair in full and that Hương had approved of the HNC's dissolution. Taylor was unimpressed by the reassurances, concluding with [...] "I don't know whether {{we will continue to}} support you after this...You people have broken a lot of dishes <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> have to see how we can straighten out this mess." [...] Taylor's deputy, U. Alexis Johnson felt the discussion had become counterproductive and was increasing the problem. He suggested that should the generals feel unwilling to alter their position immediately, they should refrain from actions that would preclude a later change of heart. He proposed they merely announce the removal of certain members of the HNC rather than the dissolution of the entire body, hoping the HNC could be reconstituted with figures they deemed to be more satisfactory. The four officers did not give a clear answer to Johnson's idea, indicating they had not made a concrete decision by saying [...] "the door is not closed".|$|E

Danny replies, [...] "It's an honor to be nominated in the same category as Sir Dave Coulier", the latter is an American actor. Liz imitates singer-songwriter Christopher Cross while singing [...] "All my days I've been waiting, for you to come back home. Moonlight of New York City", after revealing that she hoped to end up with Floyd one day and Cross would sing a romantic song about them. This song would be extended on the 30 Rock Original Television Soundtrack by Cross himself. Liz makes reference to the fact that once, on television, one could not say the word [...] "crap", but [...] "then they let that slide <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> can say whatever we want."

500|$|The Saint John Mill Rats {{moved to}} the newly created National Basketball League of Canada (NBL) for the 2011–12 season. Anderson debuted in the league debut by {{recording}} 14 points, 5 assists, and 3 steals in a 96–112 loss to the Summerside Storm on November 4, 2011. In a rematch with the same team less than one week later, he posted 25 points, although his team was still defeated by one point. Anderson scored a season-high 35 points in a 106–90 win over the Storm on November 17, hitting three of four three-pointers. He recorded 20 {{points in the second}} half alone. After leading his team in points in three of four games, Anderson earned Player of the Week honors on November 20. The point guard posted his first double-double of the season with 10 points and 10 assist in a 5-point victory over the Halifax Rainmen on December 2, despite making no treys. He was effective again on December 29, scoring 31 points vs. the London Lightning and adding 11 assists. However, on January 3, 2012, Anderson injured his hand in a defeat to the Moncton Miracles and was expected to be sidelined for three to four weeks. General manager Ian McCarthy said, [...] "This really stung because we were unable to finish the game strong against Moncton with Anthony out, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> have a road game 48 hours later against a tough Quebec team." [...] The Mill Rats responded by signing two players, including Darren Duncan. Anderson returned to the court in a rematch with the Miracles on February 1, notching 15 points and 7 assists. In the remainder of the regular season, he recorded 2 double-doubles and had three games in which he scored 20 or more points. In Game 1 of the NBL Canada Playoffs vs the London Lightning, Anderson recorded 26 points and 12 assists, going 6-of-7 from beyond the arc and 4-of-4 on free throws. He put up another 19 points in the second game. However, Saint John was swept 0–2 in the best-of-3 series and London {{went on to win the}} 2012 NBL Canada Finals.|$|E
