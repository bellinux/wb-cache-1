The {{remaining}} population of agile frogs on Jersey is very small and is restricted to the south west of the island. The species is the subject of an ongoing programme to save it from extinction in Jersey via a collaboration between States of Jersey, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and Jersey Amphibian and Reptile Group (JARG), with support and sponsorship from several other organisations. The programme includes captive breeding and release, public awareness and habitat restoration activities.|$|E
25|$|Most {{amphibians}} of the Loire {{are found}} in the slow flow areas near the delta, especially in the floodplain, marshes and oxbows. They are dominated by the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), frogs and toads. The toads include Bufo bufo, Alytes obstetricans, Bombina variegata, Bufo calamita, Pelobates fuscus and Pelobates cultripes. The frogs are represented by the Parsley frog (Pelodites punctatus), European tree frog (Hyla arborea), Common Frog (Rana temporaria), <b>Agile</b> <b>Frog</b> (R. dalmatina), Edible Frog (R. esculenta), Perez's Frog (R. perezi), marsh frog (R. ridubunda) and Pool Frog (R. lessonae). Newts of the Loire include the Marbled Newt (Triturus marmoratus), Smooth Newt (T. vulgaris), Alpine Newt (T. alpestris) and Palmate Newt (T. helveticus).|$|E

40|$|In <b>agile</b> <b>frogs,</b> Rana dalmatina, an {{increase}} in male-biased operational sex ratio and in male abundance results {{in the emergence of}} alternative male mating behaviour in the form of searching. As a consequence, females are coerced into mating with multiple males, which in turn increases the level of conflict between the sexes. Selective predation on males by the European polecat, Mustela putorius, decreases the occurrence of polyandry. In ponds visited by polecats, the sex ratio is less male biased than in ponds where polecats are absent. As a result most males call to attract females and fewer males actively search for females. Females are able to choose between calling males and mate with a single male. Thus, predation by polecats is found to influence sex ratio, male abundance and sexual conflict in a frog mating system, restricting the opportunity for multiple matin...|$|R

There, {{in the midst of his}} family, my venerable host was already disporting himself, his long, silvery beard and hair floating like a foam on the waves of his own creating. And presently from other sleeping-rooms on a line with mine shot forth new bewitching forms, each sparsely clothed in a slender clinging garment, which concealed no beauteous curve beneath; and nimbly running and leaping down the slope, they quickly joined the masculine bathers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{mating season}} takes place between March and June {{right after the}} end of hibernation. Males form {{breeding}} choruses, and their songs sound {{similar to those of the}} <b>agile</b> <b>frog,</b> (Rana dalmatina). Their calls can [...] "sound like air escaping from a submerged empty bottle: 'waug...waug...waug'. Males can also develop bright-blue coloration for a few days during the season.|$|E
50|$|The <b>agile</b> <b>frog</b> prefers light {{deciduous}} mixed forests with plentiful water. The open {{land around}} a forest is often also populated, {{as long as}} it is connected to the forest by shrubs. In dry, warm forests, this species often also lives far away from the water. Of the three Middle European Rana species, this frog likes warmth and dryness the most.|$|E
50|$|The flanks, {{limbs and}} backs {{are covered with}} {{irregular}} dark blotches and they usually sport a chevron-shaped spot {{on the back of}} their neck and a dark spot behind the eye. Unlike other amphibians, common frogs generally lack a mid-dorsal band but, when they have one, it is comparatively faint. In many countries moor frogs have a light dorsal band which easily distinguishes them from common frogs.The underbelly is white or yellow (occasionally more orange in females) and can be speckled with brown or orange. The eyes are brown with transparent horizontal pupils, and they have transparent inner eyelids to protect the eyes while underwater, as well as a 'mask' which covers the eyes and eardrums. Although the common frog has long hind legs compared to the common toad, they are shorter than those of the <b>agile</b> <b>frog</b> with which it shares some of its range. The longer hind legs and fainter colouration of the <b>agile</b> <b>frog</b> are the main features that distinguish the two species.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{and other}} predators are varied and diverse; one can spot {{the black and}} |middle spotted woodpecker, long-eared owl and many other species, a {{pleasant}} area for both amateurs and ornithologists.Amphibians and insects also constitute a huge wealth, namely the golden endemic carabus auronitens (Chrysocarabus auronitens ssp cupreonitens) but also Alpine newt, palmate newt, <b>agile</b> <b>frog,</b> salamanders. There are also remarkable butterflies and reptiles like the adder and common lizard.|$|E
50|$|The spawn clumps {{consist of}} 450 to 1800 eggs, {{and are usually}} {{attached}} to tree branches, roots, or plant stems at depths of 5 - 40 cm. Therefore, they rarely sink to the bottom. Unlike the moor frog (Rana arvalis) and common frog (Rana temporaria), the <b>agile</b> <b>frog</b> does not lay its spawn all in the one clump. The diameter of a single egg, not counting the gelatinous shell, is 1.5 - 2.1 mm.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} thin and has long limbs and a pointy snout. Adult males are rarely larger than 6.5 cm, while females can {{grow up to}} 8 cm. Its ventral surface is light brown, reddish-brown, or light greyish-brown with very little contrast. Triangle-shaped spots reach from the temple to the eardrum, which are dark brown. The {{underside}} of the <b>agile</b> <b>frog</b> is white without any spots. During mating season, the males often become dark brown.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the area}} is covered with {{broadleaf}} forest, especially European hornbeam. The park also contains heaths, meadows and swamps. Because of the mild climate and varied habitats, many different animal and plant species can be encountered in the park. The park contains unusual Swedish wildlife such as the hazel dormouse, Eurasian golden oriole, European tree frog and <b>agile</b> <b>frog.</b> There are about 600 vascular plant species, including several types of orchids and the very rare barren strawberry.|$|E
50|$|Rhabdias bufonis {{is found}} in the parts of Europe and Asia in which its host frogs are found.

50|$|The park's climate, varied {{vegetation}} and isolation allow a rich wildlife based on various raptorial birds such as hawks, booted eagles, short toed snake eagles, Egyptian vultures {{and a few}} more. But the true ornithological treasure is the middle peak woodpecker that has its largest population of Spain in this park. There are also river mammals like the otter, the Pyrenean desman, the European mink and the more common forest mammals such as the fox, the wildcat and the beech marten. Among amphibians, the Spanish painted frog, the <b>agile</b> <b>frog</b> and the alpine newt inhabit the park.|$|E
50|$|The Iberian frog is {{endemic to}} Portugal and {{north-western}} and central Spain. It is a mountain species {{and has been}} recorded at altitudes up to 2425 m. It {{is present in the}} northern half of Portugal and in Spain it is found in the region of Galicia, in west Le√≥n and in north-west Zamora, with separate populations in mountainous regions in central Spain. It favours slow-moving streams and rivers with overhanging vegetation, ponds, and glacial lakes.

50|$|There are 11 reptile and 8 {{amphibian}} species. There are Central European species (fire salamander, yellow-bellied toad, smooth snake), Palearctic (common toad, European green toad, common frog), Euro-Siberian (European tree frog, common European viper, grass snake, viviparous lizard), Irano-Turanian (marsh frog), Southern European (<b>agile</b> <b>frog),</b> Euro-Mediterranean (European green lizard), Mediterranean (common wall lizard) and Balkan (Erhard's wall lizard). The ichthyofauna includes 6 fish species: common minnow, European eel (considered extinct), western vairone, brown trout, {{rainbow trout}} and brook trout. The {{limited number of}} species {{is determined by the}} high altitude of the park. The glacial lakes, streams and upper river courses are inhabited by few fish species. The western vairone is known only from the Kremenski lakes and might in fact represent a new undescribed species.|$|E
50|$|The Iberian frog is an <b>agile</b> <b>frog,</b> {{jumping into}} the water if {{disturbed}} and swimming away rapidly. It is active both by day and night, and feeds on beetles, flies, caddisflies, stoneflies, spiders, and harvestmen. In Galicia and lowland Portugal, breeding takes place from November to March, but in upland areas, it occurs from March to May. Amplexus, with the male clinging {{to the back of}} the female, takes place in the water. Small clumps of eggs with a gelatinous coat are laid and are stuck to water weeds or placed beneath underwater stones. When the tadpoles hatch, they feed on vegetable matter and take about three months before they undergo metamorphosis into juvenile frogs. These are about 1.3 cm long. Males become mature when they are about 3 cm in length and females when they are rather larger.|$|E

It is an important wetland area and lies within a Natura 2000 nature protection area of 188 ha at {{the western edge of}} the municipal unit of Thinali. The lake's Greek name translates into English as [...] "the enemy of youth". It was once a malarial swamp and home to the anopheles mosquito, resulting in the area being uninhabited for many centuries, and it is still comparatively undeveloped. The vegetation surrounding the lake includes thickets of reed and bamboo. Inland there are orchards, olive groves and farmland, while between the lake and the sea lie sand dunes. The lake is jointly owned by the twelve principal villages of north-eastern Corfu and leased for fish farming, producing flathead grey mullet, sea bass and eel. It is also used for duck hunting. The adjacent dunes are home to the sand lily (pancratium maritimum) and the <b>agile</b> <b>frog</b> (rana dalmatina). The lake as it was in the 1930s was described by the British naturalist Gerald Durrell in his childhood autobiography My Family and Other Animals, in which it was called the [...] "Lake of Lillies". Durrell wrote that: it was a mile long, an elongated sheet of shallow water surrounded by a thick mane of cane and reed, and separated from the sea at one end by a wide, gently curving dune of white sand‚Ä¶ It was the only place on the island where those sand lilies grew, strange misshapen bulbs buried in the sand, that once a year sent up thick green leaves and white flowers above the surface, so that the dune became a glacier of flowers.
