5|$|In 738, Quiriguá, a vassal of Copán, Tikal's key {{ally in the}} south, {{switched}} {{allegiance to}} Calakmul, defeated Copán and gained its own independence. It appears that this was <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> {{effort on the part}} of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Copán.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} argued {{variously}} that the Eskaya are a remnant of the original indigenous settlers on Bohol; that they migrated to Bohol from Sumatra {{in the seventh century}} A.D.; that they are descendants of the resistance groups that fought under Francisco Dagohoy; that they are a cult or secret society; or that they are <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> reconstruction of an imagined pre-colonial society.|$|E

Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society of the Al Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles to give them a strange and eccentric appearance.|$|E

He says that what he is creating is neither folk, nor traditional, and even the harp songs are not traditional works, though they are influenced by the traditional music of the United Kingdom and traditional Irish music.|$|E
5|$|Berger {{was acquitted}} under counts one, and two, and {{some parts of}} counts three, and five, and was also acquitted under count six.

He was also convicted under that part of count seven relating to the children and youth slave labour program, including the Heuaktion, and was also convicted under count eight. Judge Powers handed down a dissenting opinion, stating that he was of the view that Berger was not responsible for the murder of Mesny.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works.

Etty in this period was generally making <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and {{it is not clear whether}} he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E
40|$|Background: Through {{the use of}} assistive {{technologies}} {{persons in}} <b>a</b> minimally <b>conscious</b> state could gain an active engagement role. Objective of the Study: Create an overview of assistive technologies used for rehabilitation interventions, which foster self-determination in adults in <b>a</b> minimally <b>conscious</b> state. Methods: Through a literature search in the databases CINAHL, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, PsycINFO and Medline publications were selected according to the following criteria: (1) adult persons (18 +) with a diagnosis of minimally conscious state, (2) survey of assistive technologies. Findings: Persons in <b>a</b> minimally <b>conscious</b> state can use microswitches to activate an environmental stimulation or a voice output communication aid. Relevance to Clinical Practice: Interventions with assistive technologies are of crucial importance because no other intervention focuses on the acquisition of an active engagement role. Limitations and Recommendations for Further Research: Important results may be missed because publications, which involved beside persons in <b>a</b> minimally <b>conscious</b> state also persons with other disabilities, were excluded. Further research should assess {{the effects of the}} devices and investigate other related devices...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the clinical {{course of a}} 51 -year-old woman in a vegetative state and of a 63 -year-old woman in <b>a</b> minimally <b>conscious</b> state. The {{difference between these two}} states is an important one, as clinical course, prognosis and medical-ethical considerations of both are different. In practice it is difficult to distinguish between a vegetative state and <b>a</b> minimally <b>conscious</b> state, but the use of a Post-Acute Level of Consciousness scale helps to illustrate the differences. Expertise, research, and application of functional neuro-imaging techniques (PET, fMRI) might also be useful. The differences between these two states regarding rehabilitation, pain management and medical-ethical decisions are important. The effects of neuro-rehabilitation and the implications of <b>a</b> minimally <b>conscious</b> state for patients and their proxies need further investigation...|$|R

Khan revealed that he {{had always wanted to}} look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, but he said he gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if {{she would be able to}} do justice to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> effort to give her own look and style to the character.|$|E
5|$|Messiaen {{continually}} evolved new composition techniques, always integrating {{them into}} his existing musical style; his final works still retain the use of modes of limited transposition. For many commentators this continual development made every major work from the Quatuor onwards <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> summation of all that Messiaen had composed up to that time. However, very few of these major works lack new technical ideas—simple examples being the introduction of communicable language in Meditations, the invention of a new percussion instrument (the geophone) for Des canyons aux etoiles..., and the freedom from any synchronisation with the main pulse of individual parts in certain birdsong episodes of St. François d'Assise.|$|E
5|$|The 1832 {{exhibition}} of Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm, a painting containing apparently gratuitous nude figures, met a hostile reception from critics. From then on, while Etty continued to paint nude {{figures for the}} rest of his career, he made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> effort to try to illustrate moral lessons with his work. This effort was not wholly successful, and he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some throughout his career. He died in late 1849, and following his death nude paintings went rapidly out of fashion in Britain.|$|E
