40|$|Northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) {{have been}} declining {{throughout}} their range since the 1960 s. The {{decline in the}} Gulf Prairies and Marshes Ecoregion (GPM) has primarily {{been the result of}} habitat loss and fragmentation. With the population already reduced, additional causes of quail decline become important issues. In 1957, red imported fire ants (RIFA, Solenopsis invicta) began to invade the GPM. RIFA can potentially affect bobwhites by direct predation of pipping chicks, reduced survival of young chicks, and competition for food. Eastern cottontails are another important species that could be impacted by RIFA. Previous work has documented RIFA predation of altricial young born in pen-raised cottontail nests. The Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge in Colorado County, Texas received large-scale aerial treatment of RIFA with Extinguish Plus? insecticide as a management action for the endangered <b>Attwater?s</b> <b>prairie-chicken</b> (Tympanuchus cupido attwateri). This presented me with an opportunity to evaluate the effects of RIFA treatment on: (1) bobwhite nest success and brood survival, (2) bobwhite abundance and density, (3) bobwhite movements and ranges, and (4) cottontail numbers. An additional objective was to (5) contribute reference data for bobwhite in the GPM to address this region?s lack of data. To investigate these objectives bobwhites were radio-collared and tracked, RIFA were sampled, and cottontails were surveyed in both the treated and non-treated areas. Treatment with Extinguish Plus? successfully reduced the abundance of RIFA in iii the treated area from 2014 ? 2017. However, I found that flooding can negate the effectiveness of the treatment when the treated area is surrounded by adjacent non-treated areas. Bobwhite densities were 76. 6 % higher (P = 0. 042) in the treated area compared to the non-treated area. There was no difference between bobwhite consecutive movements (P = 0. 275) or seasonal ranges (P = 0. 783) in the treated and non-treated area. However, there was a difference (P = < 0. 001) by category. Nesting season females without a brood had larger movements (P = < 0. 001) than nesting season females with a brood and larger movements (P = 0. 002) than pre-nesting females. Cottontail numbers were higher (P = 0. 003) in the non-treated than the treated area...|$|E
40|$|The largest {{tropical}} lake in Mexico, Lake Chapala, {{is a major}} fishery and {{a recipient}} of many contaminants (industrial and agricultural) via the Lerma River. The objectives were to evaluate concentrations of mercury (Hg), aluminum (Al), barium (Ba), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), strontium (Sr), vanadium (V), and zinc (Zn) in fish and wildlife of Lake Chapala. I also used stable isotopes carbon (???C) and nitrogen (???N) to determine trophic differences between the 3 collected fish species. I collected water, sediment, fish, and feather samples and measured these samples for Hg and other metals. Mercury concentrations in water were higher compared to other lakes around the world, but {{not as high as}} those determined from the Jose Antonio Alzate reservoir in Mexico. Sediment Hg concentrations were similar to those reported by other studies from Lake Chapala. Also, the Hg concentrations measured in fish were similar to those from other studies. Feather samples collected had a wide range of ?D values; therefore using these values were not useful for predicting significant relationships between areas of feather growth and areas of Hg acquisition. Concentrations of other metals in water, sediments, and fish were also similar to those reported in previous studies. An <b>Attwater?s</b> <b>prairie-chicken</b> (APC) study was conducted to determine the diet of wild APC populations once released from captivity with the use of stable isotope analysis of ???C and ???N. I also compared historic and contemporary APC feather ???C and ???N values to one another. I collected vegetation, insect, fecal, and blood samples from APCs on the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge (APCNWR). The stable isotope analysis revealed the mixing model produces different results dependent on the number of diet sources used. When analyzing ???C and ???N from blood, the main diet source is C? vegetation (forbs) when 3, 4, and 5 diet sources are used. Historic feather?s ???C and ???N values showed that spiders (3 and 4 diet sources) and rice (5 diet sources) contributed the most to APC diet. Contemporary feather ???C and ???N values determined insects (3 sources), forbs (3 sources), and C? vegetation (grasses; 5 sources) contributed the most...|$|E

(Pasteurelia multocida) and Trichostrongylus tenuis, may be responsible for the continuing decline of the endangered <b>Attwater's</b> <b>prairie-chicken</b> (Tympanuchus cupido attwateri). Because geese are known to contract these and other diseases of concern, 10 Canada (Branta canadensis), 24 snow (Chen caerulescens), and 22 white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) were examined for endoparasites. Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) (n = 62), the closest relative of <b>Attwater's</b> <b>prairie-chickens</b> with sympatric range, were examined for ectoparasites, endoparasites, and hemoparasites and serologically tested for 8 infectious diseases. Autopsies of 4 <b>Attwater's</b> <b>prairie-chickens</b> were performed. Geese harbored 3 cestode, 7 nematode, and 3 trematode species. Gizzard worms (Amidostomum anseris, A. spatulatum, or Epomidiostomum crami) infected 53 of 54 examined gizzards. Trichostrongylus tenuis was found in 4 of 13 geese examined. Gizzard worms frequently caused obvious localized damage to the gizzard lining; other parasite species did not appear to cause pathology. Northern bobwhite harbored I cestode, 4 nematode, and numerous unidentified lice and mite species. Raillietina spp. was found in 27 of 62 northern bobwhite, Strongyloides avium in 20 of 62, and T. tenuis in 60 of 62. Parasites did not appear to cause pathology in northern bobwhite. There was no significant (P < 0. 05) correlation of parasite intensity and host weight for either geese or northern bobwhite. All hematologic tests and serologic tests were negative. Dispharynx nasuta was found in I of 3 and T. tenuis in all 3 <b>Attwater's</b> <b>prairie-chickens</b> examined for these parasites. Intensity of T. tenuis exceeded 1, 100 in 2 individuals. Numerous unidentified lice and mites were taken from I bird. Geese appeared to harbor less potentially harmful parasites for the <b>Attwater's</b> <b>prairie-chicken</b> than did northern bobwhite. It is recommended that further examination of <b>Attwater's</b> <b>prairie-chicken,</b> sympatric northern bobwhite, and wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) for disease agents be conducted. Research on pathology of disease agents is needed {{to determine the effects of}} these diseases on <b>Attwater's</b> <b>prairie-chicken...</b>|$|R
5000|$|San Bernard River {{flows from}} a spring near New Ulm, Texas to its mouth on the Gulf of Mexico, some 120 mi to the {{southeast}} of the source. [...] Its principal tributary is Caney Creek. It passes through portions of Austin, Brazoria, Colorado, Fort Bend, Matagorda and Wharton counties.

40|$|Conservation {{biologists}} {{are increasingly}} using phylogenetics {{as a tool}} to understand evolutionary relationships and taxonomic classification. The taxonomy of North American prairie grouse (sharp-tailed grouse, T. phasianellus; lesser prairie-chicken, T. pallidicinctus; greater prairie-chicken, T. cupido; including multiple subspecies) has been designated based on physical characteristics, geography, and behavior. However, previous studies have been inconclusive in determining the evolutionary history of prairie grouse based on genetic data. Therefore, additional research investigating the evolutionary history of prairie grouse is warranted. In this study, ten loci (including mitochondrial, autosomal, and Z-linked markers) were sequenced across multiple populations of prairie grouse, and both traditional and coalescent-based phylogenetic analyses were used to address the evolutionary history of this genus. Results from this study indicate that North American prairie grouse diverged in the last 200, 000 years, with species-level taxa forming well-supported monophyletic clades in species tree analyses. With these results, managers of the critically endangered <b>Attwater's</b> <b>prairie-chicken</b> (T. c. attwateri) can better evaluate whether outcrossing <b>Attwater's</b> with greater <b>prairie-chickens</b> would be a viable management tool for Attwater's conservation...|$|R
40|$|The {{goals of}} captive {{breeding}} programs for endangered species include preserving genetic diversity and avoiding inbreeding. Typically {{this is accomplished}} by minimizing population mean kinship; however, this approach becomes less effective when errors in the pedigree exist and may result in inbreeding depression, or reduced survival. Here, both pedigree- and DNA-based methods {{were used to assess}} inbreeding depression in the critically endangered <b>Attwater’s</b> <b>prairie-chicken</b> (Tympanuchus cupido attwateri). Less variation in the pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients and parental relatedness values were observed compared to DNA-based measures suggesting that errors exist in the pedigree. Further, chicks identified with high parental DNA-based relatedness exhibited decreased survival at both 14 - and 50 -days post-hatch. A similar pattern was observed in later life stages (> 50 days post-hatch) with birds released to the wild; however, the pattern varied depending on the time post-release. While DNA-based inbreeding coefficient was positively correlated with mortality to one month post-release, an opposite pattern was observed at nine months suggesting purging of deleterious alleles. I also investigated whether immunocompetence, or the ability to produce a normal immune response, was correlated with survival; however, no significant correlation was observed suggesting that inbreeding was a more important factor influencing survival. Pairing individuals for breeding by minimizing DNA-based parental relatedness values resulted in a significant increase in chick survival. This study highlights the importance of using DNA-based methods to avoid inbreeding depression when errors exist in the pedigree...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Attwater’s</b> <b>prairie-chicken</b> (Tympanuchus cupido attwateri; APC) is {{a species}} of grouse native to Texas coastal prairies {{and is on the}} {{critically}} endangered species list as a result of habitat destruction and overhunting. All of the current populations were captively bred and released into the wild. Survivorship for released APCs is very low, and individuals seldom survive to reproduce in the wild. One factor contributing to this may be an alteration in the gut microbiota as a result of captivity. Factors potentially influencing the gut microbial composition in captivity include antibiotic therapy, stress, and a predominantly commercially formulated diet. Recent studies have begun to shed light on the importance of the host microbial endosymbionts. Antibiotic administration, stress, diet, age, genotype and other factors have been shown to influence microbial populations in the gastrointestinal tracts of many different vertebrates. Sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene amplicons on the Ion Torrent™ platform was used in this study to identify groups of bacteria in the cloacas as a surrogate for the gut microbiota in the APC. Antibiotic-treated and untreated birds, wild-hatched and captive-bred birds, and individuals sampled before and after release to the wild were examined. Significant differences were found between wild-hatched and captive raised birds both pre- and post release. In addition, there was extensive variation among the populations at the lower taxonomic ranks between individuals for each group of APCs. Principal coordinate analysis based on the weighted UniFrac distance metric further exhibited some clustering of individuals by treatment. These data suggest that captive breeding may have long-term effects on the cloacal microbiota of APCs with unknown consequences to their long-term health and survivorship...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of pen-reared <b>Attwater's</b> <b>prairie-chickens</b> (APC, Tympanuchus cupido attwateri) {{into the wild}} to supplement existing populations has met with marginal success. Flight characteristics, predator avoidance behavior, and rearing methods are possible factors contributing to post-release mortality of pen-reared birds. To evaluate flight characteristics and predator avoidance behavior of pen-reared APC's released onto the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge, flight characteristics and predator avoidance behavior of pen-reared APC's was compared to wild greater prairie-chickens (GPC, T. c. pinnatus) in Minnesota and Kansas using a radar gun and a trained dog. There was no difference (P = 0. 134) in flight speed for pen-reared APC and wild GPC. However, wild GPC had greater (P < 0. 001) flight distances than did pen-reared APC. Wild GPC and pen-reared APC that had survived in the wild {{for at least a}} year flushed at a greater (P < 0. 001) distance from an approaching human than did pen-reared APC that had been released for less than 3 months. A trained dog was able to approach closer (P < 0. 001) to APC than GPC before birds flushed, and APC did not fly as far as GPC after being flushed by the dog. Pen-reared APC displayed flight endurance deficiencies and were more approachable by humans and a dog before they flushed when compared to wild GPC, which could explain their increased mortality when released into the wild. To determine if APC chicks could be reared without daily human contact, pelleted food, and water in founts, a greenhouse was used to rear chicks in a semi-natural environment. Planted vegetation and commercial insects provided hiding cover and a food source for the APC chicks. An underground heat source provided chick warmth, and water misters and a sprinkler system simulated dew (a water source for chicks) and rain. The greenhouse provided chicks protection from predators and adverse weather conditions (before they could thermo-regulate) while exposing chicks to natural sunlight, day length, and temperature fluctuations. This technique allowed chicks to be reared in a semi-natural environment which reinforced their natural foraging behavior for food and water, and reinforced their hiding and avoidance behaviors, creating a wilder pen-reared bird...|$|R
