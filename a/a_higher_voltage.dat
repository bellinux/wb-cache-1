5|$|Electrical {{power is}} usually {{generated}} by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or {{from other sources}} such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric {{power in the world}} using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention {{in the late nineteenth century}} of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.|$|E

25|$|Consequently, power {{transmitted}} at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> requires less loss-producing current {{than for the}} same power at a lower voltage. Power is often transmitted at hundreds of kilovolts, and transformed to 100V – 240V for domestic use.|$|E
25|$|<b>High</b> <b>voltage</b> switch for non-coherent keyed power-oscillators These {{modulators}} {{consist of}} <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> pulse generator formed from <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> supply, <b>a</b> pulse forming network, and <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> switch {{such as a}} thyratron. They generate short pulses of power to feed, e.g., the magnetron, a special type of vacuum tube that converts DC (usually pulsed) into microwaves. This technology is known as pulsed power. In this way, the transmitted pulse of RF radiation is kept to a defined and usually very short duration.|$|R

25|$|In 1832, Michael Faraday's {{experiments}} led him {{to state}} his two laws of electrochemistry. In 1836, John Daniell invented a primary cell which solved the problem of polarization by eliminating hydrogen gas generation at the positive electrode. Later results revealed that alloying the amalgamated zinc with mercury would produce <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E
25|$|The LM339 accomplishes {{this with}} an open {{collector}} output. When the inverting input is at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> than the non inverting input, {{the output of the}} comparator connects to the negative power supply. When the non inverting input is higher than the inverting input, the output is 'floating' (has a very high impedance to ground).|$|E
25|$|Standard {{electrolytic}} capacitors are polarized components {{due to their}} asymmetrical construction, and may only be operated with <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> (ie, more positive) on the anode than on the cathode at all times. Voltages with reverse polarity, or voltage or ripple current higher than specified (as little as 1 or 1.5 volts may suffice), can destroy the dielectric and thus the capacitor. The destruction of {{electrolytic capacitors}} can have catastrophic consequences (explosion, fire).|$|E

Production of the Fordson Model N was transferred from Cork to Dagenham in 1933. The Model N featured a 27 HP engine, standard rear fenders (mudguards), <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> ignition system, and optional pneumatic tires. In 1935 power take-off (PTO) was available as an option on the Model N.|$|E
25|$|The 3-carbon alcohol, {{propanol}} (C3H7OH), is {{not often}} used as a direct fuel source for petrol engines(unlike ethanol, methanol and butanol), with most being directed into use as a solvent. However, it {{is used as a}} source of hydrogen in some types of fuel cell; it can generate <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> than methanol, which is the fuel of choice for most alcohol-based fuel cells. However, since propanol is harder to produce than methanol (biologically OR from oil), methanol-utilising fuel cells are preferred over those that utilise propanol.|$|E
25|$|A common {{application}} of a torque motor would be the supply- and take-up reel motors in a tape drive. In this application, driven from a low voltage, the characteristics of these motors allow a relatively constant light tension {{to be applied to}} the tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads. Driven from <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>voltage,</b> (and so delivering a higher torque), the torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring any additional mechanics such as gears or clutches. In the computer gaming world, torque motors are used in force feedback steering wheels.|$|E

25|$|A dimmer is {{a device}} used to vary the average voltage applied to an instrument's lamp. The {{brightness}} of a lamp {{is proportional to}} its electric current, {{which in turn is}} proportional to the applied lamp voltage. When the applied voltage is decreased, a lamp's electric current will also decrease, thus reducing the light output from the lamp (dimming it). Conversely, <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> will cause higher lamp current and increased (brighter) light output. Dimmers are frequently found in large enclosures called racks or dimmer racks that draw significant three-phase power. They are often removable modules that range from 20-ampere, 2.4-kilowatt to 100-ampere units.|$|E
25|$|Henneman {{proposed}} that the mechanism underlying the Size Principle was that the smaller motor neurons had a smaller surface area and therefore a higher membrane resistance. He predicted that the current generated by an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSPs) would result in <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> change (depolarization) across the neuronal membrane of the smaller motor neurons and therefore larger EPSPs in smaller motoneurons. Burke later demonstrated {{that there was a}} graded decrease of both EPSP and inhibitory post synaptic potential (IPSP) amplitudes from small to large motoneurons. This seemed to confirm Henneman's idea, but Burke disagreed, pointing out that larger neurons with a larger surface area had space for more synapses. Burke eventually showed (in a very small sample of neurons) that smaller motoneurons have a greater number of synaptic inputs from a single input source. The topic is probably still regarded as controversial.|$|E
25|$|A {{photomultiplier}} is a phototube whose sensitivity {{is greatly}} increased {{through the use}} of electron multiplication. This works on the principle of secondary emission, whereby a single electron emitted by the photocathode strikes a special sort of anode known as a dynode causing more electrons to be released from that dynode. Those electrons are accelerated toward another dynode at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>voltage,</b> releasing more secondary electrons; as many as 15 such stages provide a huge amplification. Despite great advances in solid-state photodetectors, the single-photon detection capability of photomultiplier tubes makes this vacuum tube device excel in certain applications. Such a tube can also be used for detection of ionizing radiation {{as an alternative to the}} Geiger–Müller tube (itself not an actual vacuum tube). Historically, the image orthicon TV camera tube widely used in television studios prior to the development of modern CCD arrays also used multistage electron multiplication.|$|E

25|$|In 1887, Heinrich Hertz {{observed}} that when light with sufficient frequency hits a metallic surface, it emits electrons. In 1902, Philipp Lenard {{discovered that the}} maximum possible energy of an ejected electron {{is related to the}} frequency of the light, not to its intensity: if the frequency is too low, no electrons are ejected regardless of the intensity. Strong beams of light toward the red end of the spectrum might produce no electrical potential at all, while weak beams of light toward the violet end of the spectrum would produce higher and higher voltages. The lowest frequency of light that can cause electrons to be emitted, called the threshold frequency, is different for different metals. This observation is at odds with classical electromagnetism, which predicts that the electron's energy should be proportional to the intensity of the radiation. So when physicists first discovered devices exhibiting the photoelectric effect, they initially expected that a higher intensity of light would produce <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> from the photoelectric device.|$|E
2500|$|Electrical {{energy is}} {{distributed}} as alternating current because AC voltage {{may be increased}} or decreased with a transformer. This allows the power to be transmitted through power lines efficiently at high voltage, which reduces the energy lost as heat due to resistance of the wire, and transformed to a lower, safer, voltage for use. Use of <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> leads to significantly more efficient transmission of power. The power losses (...) in the wire are {{a product of the}} square of the current (I) and the resistance (R) of the wire, described by the formula ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{problem with}} solar cells {{is that the}} high energy photons that hit the surface are {{converted}} to heat. [...] This is a loss for the cell because the incoming photons are not converted into usable energy. [...] The idea behind the hot carrier cell is to utilize some of that incoming energy which is converted to heat. [...] If the electrons and holes can be collected while hot, <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> {{can be obtained from}} the cell. [...] The problem with doing this is that the contacts which collect the electrons and holes will cool the material. [...] Thus far, keeping the contacts from cooling the cell has been theoretical. [...] Another way of improving the efficiency of the solar cell using the heat generated is to have a cell which allows lower energy photons to excite electron and hole pairs. [...] This requires a small bandgap. [...] Using a selective contact, the lower energy electrons and holes can be collected while allowing the higher energy ones to continue moving through the cell. [...] The selective contacts are made using a double barrier resonant tunneling structure. [...] The carriers are cooled which they scatter with phonons. [...] If a material with a large bandgap of phonons then the carriers will carry more of the heat to the contact and it won't be lost in the lattice structure. [...] One material which has a large bandgap of phonons is indium nitride. [...] The hot carrier cells are in their infancy but are beginning to move toward the experimental stage.|$|E
