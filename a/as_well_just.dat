5|$|As the town, where Hamasaki {{is sitting}} on the bench, starts to rain, the {{atmosphere}} where Hamasaki is the doll starts to rain <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> <b>Just</b> after Hamasaki finishes singing the second chorus, an instrumental break happens and has Hamasaki looking at the now abandoned puppet show. A truck then drives past, which vibrates the puppet show's stage, causing the doll to fall on the ground and its strings become tangled. This happens to Hamasaki as the doll; she faints in the dark atmosphere land, with strings attached to her. Hamasaki, sitting on the bench, starts to cry and sings the remaining of the song. It ends with the taxi driver, who finishes day dreaming about the marionettes dolls, opening the door for Hamasaki to enter.|$|E
5|$|Bastei Verlag, enamoured by {{the success}} of Bessy, asked Vandersteen to provide a second weekly series. With the {{popularity}} of superheroes, especially Batman, in Belgium and Germpany in these years, Vandersteen proposed a spinoff series of Suske en Wiske, based on Jerom, the strongman of the series. Called Wastl in German, 173 stories were produced between 1968 and 1972, with a publication that reached 150,000 copies at its summit. The best of these stories were published in Dutch <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> <b>just</b> like it was done with the later Bessys, but the weakness of the stories ended the series after only four years.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{crossing}} into Lansingburgh, NY40 runs northeast {{through the}} eastern end of the cemetery, passing the nearby St. Peter's Cemetery <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> <b>Just</b> after crossing the northern limits of Oakwood Cemetery, the route crosses into the town of Brunswick, where it becomes maintained by Rensselaer County and gains the County Route145 (CR145) designation. Continuing north through Brunswick, NY40 continues through Lansingburgh, which is where the route meets a junction with NY142. NY40 and NY142 become concurrent for one block in front of the Lansingburgh Reservoir, before NY40 turns northward once again. Now on Leversee Road, the route remains a two-lane residential street, reaching a junction with the terminus of CR116 (Brickyard Road).|$|E
25|$|As the {{language}} of the ruling ethnicity, some type of Nubian dialect would have been the most important language. Just like in Makuria, this language was written in a variant of the Coptic alphabet. However, while this topic is still understudied it seems that there were differences between the Old Nubian and Alodian alphabet. Erman, who studied several Alodian inscriptions, suggested that the Alodian script had five unique letters, while Monneret states that it had six. The latter also assumes that those derived from Meroitic letters. The fact that Alodia used its own dialect for writing and even developed new letters for it differs it from Makuria, where the spoken language, Old Dongolawi, was never put into writing. Except of Nubian, Greek played an important role <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> <b>Just</b> as it was for Alodia's northern cousin, Greek was probably a very prestigious language, used predominantly for liturgy and other religious matters. Both is spectaculary proven by the tomb stone of king David, which was written in surprisingly accurate Greek. Due to the sparse sources it's not possible to say much definite about the niveau of the Greek language among the common people. Perhaps one can draw parallels to Makuria though: There the niveau decayed over the centuries, leading to a hybrid language with a mixture of Greek and Nubian words, structured into one sentence after Nubian grammar rules. Coptic, as a language of communication with Christian Egypt, was only of limited relevance due to geographic reasons, but nevertheless do sparse written remains exist.|$|E

2500|$|At {{approximately}} 8:45 pm, a small tornado {{touched down}} in Jackson, Missouri.

2500|$|Except of the {{planting}} of crops, animal husbandry must have {{played an important}} role in Alodian agriculture and diet <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> <b>just</b> as it already did in Meroitic times. Al-Aswani states that cattle meat was plenty, which he ascribed to the vast grazing plains. A good bunch of the animals would have been bred by pastoralists who inhabited those plains, like for example the habitants of Taflien, who, according to Ibn Hawqal, bred camels and cattle. Al Aswani mentions how the king of Alodia possessed [...] "tawny camels of Arabian pedrigee", but archaeology does not imply wide-ranged consumption, since at Soba the remains of only three individuals could be specified, of whom none bore butcher marks. Therefore, it seems that they were rather used for transportation (See 3.2.1) and perhaps warfare. [...] Aside of cattle, sheep and goats played a significant role in the Alodian diet as well. The proportion of sheep (87%) and goat (13%) remains from Soba suggest that sheep were bred mostly for their meat, while goats were bred for their milk. Pigs, which are attested in Makuria, are interestingly absent from the archaeological record.|$|E
