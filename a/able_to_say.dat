5|$|Ternent allowed Swan {{to play on}} a month-to-month {{contract}} for the 1999–2000 season. Swan rushed his nine-month recovery period down to seven months and was playing and living on painkillers. He secretly used suppositories to stop himself from passing blood after his stomach began rejecting the painkillers. Fighting a losing battle against injuries, in March 2000 Ternent allowed {{him to leave the}} club. Before he took the decision, Swan and Ronnie Jepson began to polish the boots of legendary new signing Ian Wright – just to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> they had done so. Five days after leaving Burnley he went to York City in the fourth tier. This reunited him with former manager Terry Dolan, who offered him a contract {{until the end of the}} season.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 2003, {{his friend}} Giorgio Gaber died {{after a long}} illness at his home near Camaiore. He went to the funeral, which was held two days later at Chiaravalle Abbey where Gaber had married Ombretta Colli, but was only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that he had lost}} a brother.|$|E
25|$|At {{around two}} months, the baby engages in cooing, which mostly {{consists}} of vowel sounds. At around four months, cooing turns into babbling, {{which is the}} repetitive consonant-vowel combinations. Babies understand more than they are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> In this 0–8 months range, the child is engaged in vocal play of vegetative sounds, laughing, and cooing.|$|E

25|$|In a 2005 Gallup Poll (U.S.), a {{national}} sample of adolescents {{between the ages}} of 13 and 17 were asked what they feared the most. The question was open-ended and participants were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whatever they wanted. The top ten fears were, in order: terrorist attacks, spiders, death, failure, war, criminal or gang violence, being alone, the future, and nuclear war.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no limit}} {{to the kind of}} {{criticism}} which can be made against the court, subject to the above three criteria being met. People who genuinely believe that the court is partial and corrupt and have a rational basis for this belief should be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so without fear of being held in contempt. There is a powerful public interest that has been applied time and again in Singapore of exposing and rooting out impropriety and corruption {{on the part of those}} who hold public office, wherever or whoever they may be.|$|E
25|$|Hemispheric {{asynchrony}} in {{ice sheet}} behavior {{has been observed}} by linking short-term spikes of methane in Greenland ice cores and Antarctic ice cores. During Dansgaard–Oeschger events, the northern hemisphere warmed considerably, dramatically increasing the release of methane from wetlands, that were otherwise tundra during glacial times. This methane quickly distributes evenly across the globe, becoming incorporated in Antarctic and Greenland ice. With this tie, paleoclimatologists have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the ice sheets on Greenland only began to warm after the Antarctic ice sheet had been warming for several thousand years. Why this pattern occurs is still open for debate.|$|E

25|$|In 1851, William {{returned}} to London {{with his wife}} and two children (Frederick and Louise), on the occasion of The Great Exhibition. For the first time, Victoria met her future husband and, despite the age difference (she was eleven years old and he was nineteen), they got along very well. To promote the contact between the two, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert asked their daughter to guide Frederick through the exhibition, and during the visit the princess was able to converse in perfect German, while the prince was only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a few words in English. The meeting was therefore a success, and, years later, Prince Frederick would recall the positive impression that Victoria made on him during this visit, with her mixture of innocence, intellectual curiosity and simplicity.|$|E

Ellen tells Susan that she was right and struggles to say the word. Finally, Ellen is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "I'm gay," [...] inadvertently broadcasting her announcement over the airport's public address system. Ellen assumes that Susan will be leaving with Richard but in fact Susan will be staying in town for several more days.|$|E

500|$|The {{holder of}} a mere power is {{therefore}} {{free to do}} what he wants with the property he holds; if he fails to consider his exercise of the power, the courts may force him to do so. The leading test for mere powers is the [...] "any given postulant" [...] test, laid down in Re Gulbenkian. This states that the trustees must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with certainty, when a potential beneficiary comes before them, that he either is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E
500|$|In March 1930, {{ill health}} {{prevented}} Ferens from attending the company’s Annual Meeting. It {{was the first}} he had missed in 50 years. He had not fulfilled any public engagements for some weeks; nevertheless, he wrote out his speech and it was presented by Sir Harold Reckitt. In the speech Ferens was again able to present the board with pleasing figures. The net profit was £1,277,683, an increase of £33,108 over 1928, which was itself a record year. It {{was a source of}} great gratification for him [...] "to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the most cordial relations exist between the workers, the management and the board".|$|E

Years from now, though, I'll be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I played with Rickey Henderson, and I imagine it will be like saying I played with Babe Ruth." [...] Padres general manager Kevin Towers said, [...] "I get e-mails daily from fans saying, 'Sign Rickey.' ...I get more calls and e-mails about him than anybody...

40|$|The {{greatest}} intellectual {{challenge to}} the field of behavior analysis may be understanding linguistic productivity (e. g., being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> correctly <b>say</b> and understand novel sentences). One of the main issues concerning linguistic productivity is whether behavioral productivity is, itself, a fundamental behavioral process, as claimed by the proponents of relational frame theory, or whether we can understand linguistic productivity in terms of more fundamental behavioral principles...|$|R
40|$|Most {{agree that}} believing a {{proposition}} normally or ideally results in believing that one believes it, {{at least if}} one considers {{the question of whether}} one believes it. I defend a much stronger thesis. It is impossible to believe without knowledge of one's belief. I argue, roughly, as follows. Believing that p entails that one is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> honestly assert that p. But anyone who is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> honestly assert that p is also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> just <b>say</b> – i. e., authoritatively, yet {{not on the basis of}} evidence – that she believes that p. And anyone who is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> just <b>say</b> that she believes that p is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> act in light of the fact that she holds that belief. This ability to act, in turn, constitutes knowledge of the psychological fact. However, without a broader theory of belief to help us make sense of this result, this conclusion will be hard to accept. Why should being in a particular mental state by itself necessitate an awareness of being in that state? I sketch a theory that helps to answer this question: believing is a matter of viewing a proposition as what one ought to believe. I show how this theory explains the thesis that to believe is to know that you believe...|$|R
5000|$|In Grant Morrison's [...] "Here Comes Tomorrow" [...] arc of New X-Men, {{a similar}} story was crafted with {{a young man named}} Tom Skylark, who owned a Sentinel named 'Rover' that fed him as a child and looked after him, despite being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> only <b>say</b> the word 'DESTROY!'. He and Rover join the {{remnants}} of the future X-Men in a last-ditch effort to fight against impending destruction.|$|R
500|$|There are {{permitted}} variations {{to the original}} Scout Promise to accommodate those whose faith or national allegiance are different. The association expects that the phrases [...] "...duty to God‟ and [...] "...to love God" [...] will be suitable for most faiths [...] "including Christians, Hindus, Jews, Muslims and Sikhs". Muslims who have difficulty with the phrase [...] "On my honour" [...] because of the Islamic proscription of swearing oaths, are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent the Most Merciful…" [...] instead if they prefer. Also, [...] "...duty to Allah and to the Queen" [...] may be used. Hindus and Buddhists may promise [...] "...duty to my Dharma".|$|E
500|$|According to Sestero and Greg Ellery, Wiseau {{came to the}} Birns and Sawyer film lot, {{rented a}} studio, and bought a [...] "complete Beginning Director package," [...] which {{included}} the purchase of two brand new film and HD cameras. Wiseau, confused {{about the differences between}} 35 mm film and high-definition video, decided to shoot the entire film in both formats simultaneously, using a custom-built apparatus that housed both cameras side-by-side and required two crews to operate. Commenting on his decision to shoot the film in this way, Wiseau said {{that he wanted to be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he was the first director to film an entire movie simultaneously in two formats, although ultimately only the 35mm footage was used in the final edit.|$|E
500|$|Music {{journalist}} Sarah Champion {{pointed out}} (prior to the million pound fire) that, [...] "Being 'in the money' doesn't mean they'll ever be rich. [...] always be , but their pranks {{will get more}} extravagant. If they earned £10 million, they'd blow it all by buying Jura or a fleet of K Foundation airships or a Van Gogh to be ceremonially burned." [...] "There are things we'd like to do which we haven't done.", Drummond told a journalist in 1991. [...] "Totally ludicrous things. We want to buy ships, have submarines. They really are stupid things I know, but I feel confident that {{in the event of}} us selling ten million albums we would definitely {{go out and buy a}} submarine....Just to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'Look we've got a submarine and 808 State haven't'." ...|$|E

60|$|But on {{the next}} morning they did come together. It was {{the day before the}} {{departure}} of the Bertrams, and whatever was to be said must be said then. Caroline watched her opportunity, and as soon as breakfast was over--they all breakfasted in the public salon--asked him to come into her aunt's sitting-room. She was quite collected, had fully made up her mind what <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and was <b>able</b> also <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it without hesitation, and with perfect self-possession. This was more than could be boasted of on the gentleman's behalf.|$|R

500|$|She visited troops, hospitals, factories, {{and parts}} of Britain that were {{targeted}} by the German Luftwaffe, in particular the East End, near London's docks. Her visits initially provoked hostility; rubbish was thrown at her and the crowds jeered, in part because she wore expensive clothes that served to alienate her from people suffering the deprivations of war. She explained that if the public came to see her they would wear their best clothes, so she should reciprocate in kind; Norman Hartnell dressed her in gentle colours and avoided black to represent [...] "the rainbow of hope". When Buckingham Palace itself took several hits {{during the height of}} the bombing, Elizabeth was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "I'm glad we've been bombed.

500|$|Aubrey {{received}} {{a salary of}} $4,000 a week, but had no contract.

[...] Like {{most of the big}} studios in the 1960s, MGM was struggling and Kerkorian said his new president would bring the company roaring back to its former glory. Instead, Aubrey largely liquidated the company as Kerkorian transformed it into a hospitality company with the MGM Grand Hotel he was building. [...] "We've been using old-fashioned methods here," [...] Aubrey said at the time. In 1986, he said the company was [...] "total disarray. Until you were in a position to lift up the rug, {{there was no way to}} know how much disarray. The crown jewel of studios had become a shambles." ...|$|E
500|$|Around 5:00 pm {{the wind}} began to shift, to British disadvantage. De Grasse gave signals for the van to move further ahead {{so that more}} of the French fleet might engage, but Bougainville, fully engaged with the British van at musket range, {{did not want to}} risk [...] "severe {{handling}} had the French presented the stern." [...] When he did finally begin pulling away, British leaders interpreted it as a retreat: [...] "the French van suffered most, because it was obliged to bear away." [...] Rather than follow, the British hung back, continuing to fire at long range; this prompted one French officer to write that the British [...] "only engaged from far off and simply in order to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that they had fought." [...] Sunset brought an end to the firefight, with both fleets continuing on a roughly southeast tack, away from the bay.|$|E
