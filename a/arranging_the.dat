5|$|Burke was the Band Director for the Packers, <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> pre-game and half-time shows, {{while also}} leading the {{official}} Green Bay Packers band.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} {{received}} puzzles in the game involves <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> pieces of a dialogue between the sculpted heads of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. The player listens to the randomly ordered statements made by each head, then decides how to chronologically arrange the statements to form a coherent conversation based on context.|$|E
5|$|During the 1768 Sejm, Repnin {{showed his}} {{disregard}} for local resistance by <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> abduction and imprisonment of Kajetan Sołtyk, Józef A. Załuski, Wacław Rzewuski and Seweryn Rzewuski, all vocal opponents of foreign domination and the recently proclaimed policies. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had legally and practically become a protectorate of the Russian Empire. Nonetheless, several minor beneficial reforms were adopted, political {{rights of the}} religious minorities were restored {{and the need for}} more reforms was becoming increasingly recognized.|$|E
50|$|Gerrard Williams <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> {{military}} band {{edition of}} the suite for Chappell's Army Journal. Paul V. Yoder also <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> march for Chappell & Co.|$|R
50|$|Miyaki {{had written}} and {{arranged}} various insert songs in Gekisou Sentai Carranger and also composed and <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> Hurricaneger and Gekiranger soundtracks; he <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> Gekiranger ending theme.|$|R
5000|$|Composer Robin Holloway <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> Brahms Piano Quintet {{for full}} {{orchestra}} in 2008. A live 2014 performance {{can be heard}} on the NPK Radio website. [...] Composer Nick Norton has also <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> piece for piano and orchestra.|$|R
5|$|Melvil Dewey (1851–1931) was an American {{librarian}} and self-declared reformer. He was {{a founding}} member of the American Library Association and can be credited with the promotion of card systems in libraries and business. He developed the ideas for his library classification system in 1873 while working at Amherst College library. He applied the classification to the books in that library, until in 1876 he had a first version of the classification. In 1876, he published the classification in pamphlet form with the title A Classification and Subject Index for Cataloguing and <b>Arranging</b> <b>the</b> Books and Pamphlets of a Library.|$|E
5|$|Mufarrij {{also tried}} to win support among the Christians, and {{possibly}} curry the favour of the Byzantine Empire as well, by sponsoring works to restore the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which had only recently been demolished on the orders of al-Hakim, and by <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> re-appointment of a Patriarch to the vacant see. In general, the Jarrahids {{seem to have had}} close relations with the Christians and maintained contact with Byzantium, a fact which would play a role in later events.|$|E
5|$|October 4 also {{provided}} another worrying incident to Egyptian commanders, who {{became aware that}} evening that EgyptAir, the country's national airline, had canceled all its flights and was <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> protection of its civil air fleet by dispersing its aircraft to refuges outside Egypt. The orders came from the Minister of Aviation, Ahmed Nuh. General Headquarters quickly intervened to reverse the dispersal orders, and by October 5 flights were back to their normal schedule. It was believed the incident was a breach of security and a leak on Egyptian plans for war. It was not clear to Egyptian commanders however, whether the Israelis {{were aware of the}} incident.|$|E
50|$|In 1869-70, Nadezhda Nikolayevna Purgold <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} version of Antar for piano four-hands. In 1875, {{four years after}} her marriage to Rimsky-Korsakov, she also <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> second version of Antar for piano four-hands. This arrangement was published by Bessel.|$|R
5000|$|... "But I am {{not afraid}} to {{consider}} the final question as to whether, ultimately - in the great future - we can <b>arrange</b> <b>the</b> atoms the way we want; the very atoms, all the way down! What would happen if we could <b>arrange</b> <b>the</b> atoms {{one by one the}} way we want them ...|$|R
50|$|The puzzle has 150 movable pieces: 60 corner pieces, 60 edge {{pieces that}} are {{adjacent}} to a pentagonal face (so-called pentagonal edges) and 30 edge pieces that are not (non-pentagonal edges). Only even permutations of all three types of pieces are possible (i.e. {{it is impossible to}} have only one pair of identical pieces swapped). Thus, there are 60!/2 possible ways to <b>arrange</b> <b>the</b> corner pieces, 60!/2 ways to <b>arrange</b> <b>the</b> pentagonal edges and 30!/2 ways to <b>arrange</b> <b>the</b> non-pentagonal edges.|$|R
5|$|Renaissance zoologists {{made use}} of Aristotle's zoology in two ways. Especially in Italy, {{scholars}} such as Pietro Pomponazzi and Agostino Nifo lectured and wrote commentaries on Aristotle. Elsewhere, authors used Aristotle {{as one of their}} sources, alongside their own and their colleagues' observations, to create new encyclopedias such as Konrad Gessner's 1551 Historia Animalium. The title and the philosophical approach were Aristotelian, but the work was largely new. Edward Wotton similarly helped to found modern zoology by <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> animals according to Aristotle's theories, separating out folklore from his 1552 De differentiis animalium.|$|E
5|$|Since I Left You is {{the debut}} studio album by the Avalanches. They started {{recording}} in 1999 and {{had used the}} working title of Pablo's Cruise. The duo primarily worked with a Yamaha Promix 01 and Akai S2000 samplers. The band's members, Darren Seltmann and Robbie Chater, spent hours sampling music from vinyl records to create the songs on the album: Chater estimates that there are over 3,500 samples. After sampling and <b>arranging,</b> <b>the</b> pair would swap their tapes, listen to each other's ideas and expand on whatever they had heard. Despite working separately, both Chater and Seltmann had nearly identical studio set-ups.|$|E
5|$|T'Pol, {{working out}} in the gym, also keeps urging Archer to {{apologize}} to the Kreetassans for Porthos' behavior, but Archer resists because he blames them for Porthos' illness. In the end, Porthos recovers following a pituitary transplant from an alien chameleon. Finally swallowing his pride, Archer then goes down to the Kreetassan capital and delivers an intricate ritual apology which involves slicing a tree trunk with a chainsaw, <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> pieces of wood in a complex pattern on the ground, and chanting phrases in the Kreetassan language. Having successfully apologised to the Kreetassans, the crew finally manage to procure three plasma injectors prior to their departure.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 he <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> {{score for}} the ballet film The Tales of Beatrix Potter. His sources were many and varied, {{including}} the operas of Michael William Balfe and Arthur Sullivan. He also <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> music and conducted the orchestra for Nijinsky in 1980.|$|R
50|$|Among {{his various}} backing musicians, Drake was {{accompanied}} by Richard Thompson from Fairport Convention and Danny Thompson of Pentangle. Robert Kirby, a friend of Drake's from his youth, <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> string instruments for several tracks while Harry Robinson <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> strings for River Man.|$|R
5000|$|Squire <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> {{music of}} other composers and popular {{songs of the}} day for the cello, for example Musette by Offenbach which he {{performed}} {{at one of the}} London Ballad Concerts in March 1915; [...] he also <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> music of Chopin, Bach and others.|$|R
5|$|The {{cinematography}} by William Lubtchansky furthers Rivette's {{interest in}} visual textures. The film's colour palette is largely natural, except for certain scenes—like the initial dream sequence—that are filmed in vivid colours. In {{the scene where}} Marie is <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> attic room, the light changes—from shadow to warm light—just as she places an oil lamp on a stool to indicate that she has placed it correctly; this introduces a supernatural element that contrasts with the realism {{of the rest of}} the film.|$|E
5|$|The party {{leadership}} meeting in Warsaw on 20 December recognized {{the danger that}} the working class revolt presented to their system, and, in consultations with the disturbed Soviet leaders, proceeded with <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> resignation of Gomułka, who was by then stressed out and ill. Several of his collaborators were also removed. Edward Gierek was drafted as the new first secretary. Mieczysław Moczar, another strong contender, was not trusted (or was even blamed for the current debacle) by the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|Arrangers called gamemasters (GMs) {{determine}} {{the rules and}} setting of a LARP, and may also influence an event and act as referees while it is taking place. The GMs may also do the logistical work, or {{there may be other}} arrangers who handle details such as advertising the event, booking a venue, and financial management. Unlike the GM in a tabletop role-playing game, a LARP GM seldom has an overview of everything that is happening during play because numerous participants may be interacting at once. For this reason, a LARP GM's role is often less concerned with tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining the players, and more with <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> structure of the LARP before play begins and facilitating the players and crew to maintain the fictional environment during play.|$|E
50|$|Brubeck {{subsequently}} <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> {{piece for}} orchestra.|$|R
50|$|Fried also <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> exotica album Orienta.|$|R
5000|$|In 1890, Alexander Siloti was {{approached}} to <b>arrange</b> <b>the</b> music for piano duet. He declined, but suggested his then 17-year-old cousin Sergei Rachmaninoff {{would be more}} than competent. This offer was accepted, although Siloti supervised the arrangement. [...] Rachmaninoff himself <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> entire score for piano solo.|$|R
5|$|Following her father's {{advice on}} the {{importance}} of getting an education or a trade, Bancroft completed high school in Tenterfield before moving to Canberra in 1976 with her husband-to-be Ned Manning, who had also been her teacher. There Bancroft completed a Diploma of Visual Communications through the Canberra School of Art, followed by a Master of Studio Practice and a Master of Visual Arts (Paintings) at the University of Sydney. She never returned to live in Tenterfield, although her three sisters were living there in 2004. Her father died around 1990. Bancroft has three children: Jack was born in 1985, Ella in 1988. She separated from Manning when they were very young; her third child Rubyrose was born in 1999. Jack was awarded NSW Young Australian of the Year in 2010 for his work <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> mentoring of Indigenous school students.|$|E
5|$|Much {{time was}} spent on getting guitars to sound as Simon preferred. A bit of {{experimentation}} among the additional session players occurred, from which Simon would edit himself, compiling them together or often deleting them altogether. Many songs were recorded with a hand-built cigar-box guitar, which Simon bought from Mississippi blues musician Super Chikan. Analogue effects were applied before recording digitally to keep mixes simple; this method also inspired Simon while <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> songs. Smith would burn Simon a compact disc each evening of the day’s session, and he would return {{the next day with}} notes on the recordings. This resulted in mixes being created as the album developed, rather than {{at the end of the}} process. Simon and Ramone often listened to their recordings while driving around, noting what would need changes.|$|E
5|$|On October 23, 1928, RCA {{announced}} it was merging Film Booking Offices and Keith-Albee-Orpheum to form the new motion picture business Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO), with Sarnoff as chairman. Kennedy, who retained Pathé, was paid $150,000 for <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> merger {{on top of the}} millions of dollars in profit he made from selling off his stock. Joseph I. Schnitzer, ranking FBO vice-president, was elevated to president of the new company's production arm, replacing Kennedy. William LeBaron, the last FBO production chief, retained his position after the merger, but the new studio, dedicated to full sound production, cut ties with most of FBO's roster of silent-screen performers. Movies that Film Booking Offices had either produced or arranged to distribute were released under the FBO banner through the end of 1929. The last official FBO production to reach American theaters was Pals of the Prairie, directed by Louis King and starring Buzz Barton and Frank Rice, released July 1, 1929.|$|E
50|$|A mass {{funeral was}} <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> next day.|$|R

5|$|Porter Alexander is {{best known}} as an artilleryman who played a {{prominent}} role in many of the important battles of the war. He served in different artillery capacities for Longstreet's First Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia, starting that role on November 7, 1862, after leaving Lee's staff to command the battalion that was the corps' artillery reserve. He was promoted to colonel on December 5. He was instrumental in <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> artillery in defense of Marye's Heights at the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, which proved to be the decisive factor in the Confederate victory. While the rest of Longstreet's corps was located around Suffolk, Virginia, Alexander accompanied Stonewall Jackson on his flanking march at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, and his artillery placements in Hazel Grove at Chancellorsville proved decisive.|$|E
5|$|Taxonomy in the Middle Ages {{was largely}} based on the Aristotelian system, with {{additions}} concerning the philosophical and existential order of creatures. This included concepts such as the Great chain {{of being in the}} Western scholastic tradition, again deriving ultimately from Aristotle. Aristotelian system did not classify plants or fungi, {{due to the lack of}} microscope at the time, as his ideas were based on <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> complete world in a single continuum, as per the scala naturae (the Natural Ladder). This, as well, was taken into consideration in the Great chain of being. Advances were made by scholars such as Procopius, Timotheos of Gaza, Demetrios Pepagomenos, and Thomas Aquinas. Medieval thinkers used abstract philosophical and logical categorizations more suited to abstract philosophy than to pragmatic taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|The {{benefice}} {{has expanded}} {{during the long}} history of its church. Cockthorpe and Little Langham parish was added in 1606, Glandford in 1743, Wiveton in 1922, and Cley in 1935. The parish is in the deanery of Holt, the Diocese of Norwich and the Province of Canterbury. The rector originally received tithes to support himself and the church, but this was later replaced by rent from the glebe (church lands). Rector Pointer, for example, received tithes and also had the income from the sales of his corn and saffron crops. The state had supported poorer clergy since the introduction of Queen Anne's Bounty in 1704, but since 1947 the Church Commissioners have been responsible for <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> stipends and pensions of Anglican priests.|$|E

50|$|Saito <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack for the anime Mizuiro Jidai (1996-1997), {{alongside}} Harukichi Yamamoto. He <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack for the Kyoko Fukada-starring drama Imagine in 2001, and in 2009 started {{producing the}} music for the children's music program Okaasan to Issho for the Monoran Monoran and Poco Potteito segments.|$|R
