40|$|This paper investigates an {{individual}} who has the rule-based and consequence-based moral tastes and has time-inconsistent intertemporal preferences caused by immediate gratification. The individual decides whether to undertake the activity that maximizes her own self-interest, but is uncertain whether it harms others. The individual at the earlier stage decides whether to <b>access</b> the <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> as the commitment devise for avoidance of preference reversals between the earlier-stage and later-stage selves, but is uncertain about whether this access is beneficial. The decision whether to <b>access</b> the <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> greatly influences the probability that social harm occurs. The relation between moral taste and pattern of information acquisition is clarified in the following way. The rule-based individual follows the morally bad pattern of information acquisition, while the consequence-based individual follows the morally good pattern. The individual with moral constraint follows the morally bad pattern if the moral constraint improves the earlier-stage self's morality, while she follows the morally good pattern if the moral constraint only serves to avoid preference reversals. It is shown {{that even if the}} access is beneficial, the individual is likely to misperceive it as being against her own interest and be averse to costless information. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the debate around why and how <b>access</b> to <b>information</b> {{can be used to}} prevent and control corruption. <b>Access</b> to <b>information</b> can not only bring corruption cases to light, it can also be a fundamental tool for its prevention and control, given that it encourages the creation of channels of participation and helps to identify vulnerabilities in both the public and the private sectors that might become windows of opportunity for corrupt practices. The paper`s conceptual framework explains how initiatives aimed at promoting <b>access</b> to <b>information</b> that are based on the concept of targeted transparency enable greater accountability in key areas of public management, by taking into consideration the effectiveness and quality of <b>access</b> to <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> or mechanisms, as well as the capacities and interests of the users to gain access to and use this information. ...|$|R

50|$|Aside from simply {{denying the}} vote by {{outright}} discrimination, or by curtailing {{the power of}} the democratically elected body, interest groups or governments seeking to usurp or hold onto power employed a variety of methods. An early case of electoral fraud was in an election to the county of Northamptonshire in England in 1768, when three earls spent more than Â£100,000 each to buy votes from voters to win their seats. Voter intimidation was widespread in the German federal election, March 1933, immediately before the Nazi party abolished Parliament's powers. Hitler had become Chancellor at the start of 1933 in a coalition agreement, and with control over the police, opposition party members and campaigners were beaten up and imprisoned throughout the voting process. As electoral systems became more mature, the focus of unfairness turned toward campaign finance and media bias. Almost every country in the developed world introduced limits on the amount that could be spent by any particular candidate in an election. The large exception was the United States, because a majority of judges on the US Supreme Court who were appointed by the Republican Party continued to strike down campaign finance limits as unconstitutional from 1976. A majority of countries also have some form of media regulation, so that news coverage has to be impartial and accurate in its treatment of political issues. Regulation may also extend to who owns news and television organisations, so that the power to grant <b>access</b> <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> is not unduly limited.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} inequalities of the {{accessibility}} and usage of spatial {{information in the}} age of information and communication technologies. On the one hand information accessibility are determined by several social, economic and infrastructural factors, which could be measured by com-plex indicators. On the other hand, due to infrastructure development, increasing number of people have become able to <b>access</b> the new <b>information</b> <b>channels,</b> resulting that accessibility could now be treated as a secondary problem. In contrast with accessibility differences, recently a new type of dispar-ity emerges: the differences between users in the quality of usage. Concerning spatial information the paper reflects on the uneven possibilities of getting in touch with geoinformation. Additionally, when looking on the maps of spatial information usage, a significant relationship can be observed between the accessibility and usage pattern...|$|R
40|$|In {{the era of}} {{information}} and communication technologies it is necessary to clarify what motives are in the background of disparities. The paper firstly,sets up a theoretical framework that depending on the phase of innovation adaptation, main features of inequalities have different basic characteristics. By the multivariable analysis {{of information}} accessibility differences in the Hungarian microregions, basically the physical infrastructural constraints of the information society and economy are determined. Secondly, since an increasing number of people have become able to <b>access</b> the new <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> by today, the factor of accessibility could now be treated as a secondary problem. In contrast with accessibility differences the inequalities of usage come into the forefront of the analyses. Finally, the last section reveals that instead of usage volume differences the inequalities in the quality of information usage should be taken into consideration, when dealing with the newest geographical inequalities of the information age...|$|R

U.

We investigate the current practices of media studies researchers and how these practices affect their research questions. Through the analysis of 27 interviews about the research practices of media studies researchers during a research project we developed a model of the activities in their research cycle. We find that information gathering and analysis activities are dominating the research cycle. These activities influence the research outcomes as they determine how research questions asked by media studies researchers evolve. Specifically, we show how research questions are related to the availability and accessibility of data as well as new information sources for contextualization of the research topic. Our contribution is a comprehensive account of the overall research cycle of media studies researchers as well as specific aspects of the research cycle, i. e., information sources, information seeking challenges, and the development of research questions.

30|$|Several {{potential}} caveats {{remain in}} the interpretation of the findings. As noted before, it is difficult to disentangle the information and aspiration effect of migration. The presented results are more likely to reflect a pure aspiration effect, i.e., that migration changes the goal setting of households having full information, than a simple change in information available to households for two reasons: First, 91.6 % of the households in the sample have a television, and about one-third of the households have a computer, i.e., people have the means to <b>access</b> <b>information.</b> Second, and more importantly, if migration were only an <b>information</b> <b>channel,</b> previous migration waves would have made pure information available before 2011.

40|$|This {{research}} focuses {{specifically on}} uncertainty and information seeking {{in a digital}} environment. In this research we argue that different types of uncertainty {{are associated with the}} information seeking process and that, with the proliferation of new and different search tools, sources and channels, uncertainty, positive/desirable or negative/undesirable, continues to be a significant factor in the search process. Users may feel uncertain at any stage of the information search and retrieval process and uncertainty may remain even after completion of the process resulting in what may be called persistent uncertainty. An online questionnaire was used to collect data from users in the higher education sector. There were three parts to the questionnaire focusing on: information seeking activities, information seeking problems, and <b>access</b> to specific <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> or sources. Quantitative analysis was carried out on the data collected through the online questionnaire. A total of 668 responses were returned from the chosen user categories of academic staff, research staff and research students. This research has shown that there are some information seeking activities and information seeking problems that are the most common causes of uncertainty among significant number of users from different disciplines, age, gender, ICT skills, etc. This is also the case with respect to access to and use of specific information sources/channels, although the degrees of uncertainty in relation are relatively small.

The Turkish Historical Society Library, The National Library of Turkey, The Ottoman Archives and The Republican Archives are the most heavily used information centers.

40|$|High school pupils {{operate in}} a macro (country-specific), meso (school-specific) and micro (personal) context and their {{information}} needs are always experienced in a context - sometimes as imposed school assignments or else self-generated, e. g. as everyday life information needs. Pupils source their information through various <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> and there is sometimes a perceived risk to acting on incorrect information. Compared to adults in information-intensive professions, {{researchers have found that}} pupils tend to be unconcerned about the credibility of information. Based on a literature survey, a trust model was compiled from a number of other models and adapted to serve as an <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility model portraying the pupil in context with his/her perception of <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility. The model was used as a framework for a study on high school pupilsâ perceptions of <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility and factors influencing their perceptions. The study was guided by the following research problem: How can school pupilsâ perceptions of <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility inform school-based interventions? In order to find answers, the following sub-questions were addressed: â¢	What has been reported on perceptions of information credibility and <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility, with specific reference to school pupils, students and adults, as well as professionals in information-intensive environments? â¢	How can trust models guide a study of pupilsâ perceptions of <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility? â¢	What factors influence school pupilsâ perceptions of <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility? â¢	What school-based interventions could be recommended to address the shortcomings in the perceptions of pupils that can prepare them to meet the information requirements of adulthood? A self-administered print questionnaire was used in May 2015 to survey the perceptions of 548 South African high school pupils from three different schools covering the range of the socio-economic spectrum from wealthy through to pupils from poor, unemployed home environments. The study was conducted with grade 8 and grade 12 pupils (entry and exit grades for South African high schools) from a city in the Mpumalanga province of South Africa. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the principals of the three schools. The results are reported as descriptive statistics supported with inferential statistics and qualitative analysis where relevant. The findings are that pupilsâ perceptions of <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility are affected by the perceived risk of acting on incorrect information, their previous experience and the context (i. e. type of information need, whether the need is imposed or self-generated and pupil demographics) in which the information need occurs. Pupils used a level of metacognition with regard to <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility. The model proved useful to guide data collection that can guide school-based interventions. It holds potential to be further adapted to actually reflect school-based interventions. School-based interventions are suggested to encourage responsible assessment of <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility, including the simulation of risk by means of mark allocation for metacognition about <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility, intentional exposure of pupils {{to a wide range of}} information needs and exposure to highly credible as well as less credible <b>information</b> <b>channels.</b> Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

40|$|One of {{the many}} {{legacies}} left to us through ancient Greek literature {{is the concept of}} mentoring (Nash & Treffinger, 1993; Noller & Frey, 1995). In fact, the term itself originated in Homerâs epic poem, The Odyssey, wherein Odysseus (Ulysses) â when he was setting off for the wars in Troy â asked his trusted friend Mentor to care for his son Telemachus. To further complicate matters, as Homer was wont to do, Mentor {{turned out to be the}} goddess Athena in disguise. In any case, picking up on mythology, Boston (1976) noted that the ideal mentoring relationship involves three key components: (1) continuing to carry out other duties while assuming the care-giving role (Mentor did not, in any sense, become merely a full-time babysitter); (2) serving as a conduit for the wisdom of others (Mentor, the classic âguide on the sideâ, <b>accessed</b> and <b>channeled</b> <b>information</b> from many sources to provide direction for Telemachus); and (3) developing a long-term connection (Mentor was a continuing influence and support as the boy grew to adulthood).
