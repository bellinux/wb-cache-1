Because of the remoteness of this region from continental areas, low part per trillion by volume (pptv) mixing ratios of <b>acidic</b> <b>gases</b> were anticipated to be pervasive over the South Pacific basin. However, at altitudes of 2 – 12 km over the South Pacific, air parcels were encountered frequently with significantly enhanced mixing ratios (up to 1200 pptv) of <b>acidic</b> <b>gases.</b> Most of these air parcels were centered in the 3 – 7 km altitude range and occurred within the 15 °− 65 °S latitudinal band. The <b>acidic</b> <b>gases</b> exhibited an overall general correlation with CH 3 Cl, PAN, and O 3, suggestive of photochemical and biomass burning sources. There was no correlation or trend of <b>acidic</b> <b>gases</b> with common industrial tracer compounds (e. g., C 2 Cl 4 or CH 3 CCl 3). The combustion emissions sampled over the South Pacific basin were relatively aged exhibiting C 2 H 2 /CO ratios {{in the range of}} 0. 2 – 2. 2 pptv/ppbv. The relationships between <b>acidic</b> <b>gases</b> and this ratio were similar to what was observed in aged air parcels (i. e., 3 ̆e 3 – 5 days since they were over a continental area) over the western North Pacific during the Pacific Exploratory Mission-West Phases A and B (PEM-West A and B). In the South Pacific marine boundary layer a median C 2 H 2 /CO ratio of 0. 6 suggested that this region was generally not influenced by direct inputs of biomass combustion emissions. Here we observed the lowest mixing ratios of <b>acidic</b> <b>gases,</b> with median values of 14 pptv for HNO 3, 19 pptv for HCOOH, and 18 pptv for CH 3 COOH.

40|$|The uptake of halogen and nitric acids into acidic {{sulphate}} particles {{has important}} implications for volcano monitoring and the environmental geochemistry of volcanic emissions. Using the Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model (E-AIM) for HCl, HBr and HNO 3, combined with a simple three-parameter model for HF and HI, we show that equilibrium partitioning of halogen and nitric acids into sulphate particles is maximised at high relative humidity (RH), low temperature, low plume dilution (i. e., near-source) and high SO 42 −/SO 2. The addition of metal chlorides (i. e., NaCl) enhances <b>acidic</b> <b>gas</b> partitioning at high RH, but diminishes <b>acidic</b> <b>gas</b> partitioning at low RH due to a decrease in the water content of particles and the formation of Na sulphate salts.
