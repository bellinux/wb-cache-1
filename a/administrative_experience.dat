5|$|His spirits buoyed, Nixon {{sought a}} second term, {{but some of}} Eisenhower's aides aimed to {{displace}} him. In a December 1955 meeting, Eisenhower proposed that Nixon not run for reelection {{in order to give}} him <b>administrative</b> <b>experience</b> before a 1960 presidential run and instead become a Cabinet officer in a second Eisenhower administration. Nixon believed such an action would destroy his political career. When Eisenhower announced his reelection bid in February 1956, he hedged on the choice of his running mate, stating that it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated. Although no Republican was opposing Eisenhower, Nixon received a substantial number of write-in votes against the President in the 1956 New Hampshire primary election. In late April, the President announced that Nixon would again be his running mate. Eisenhower and Nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the November 1956 election.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the extent superintendents in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming relied on (a) prior <b>administrative</b> <b>experiences,</b> (b) network of colleagues, (c) professional and governmental organizations, (d) academic preparation, and (e) research to effectively complete key job responsibilities. For this study, the key job responsibilities were the eight standards identified by the American Association of School Administrators Commission on Standards for the Superintendency, chaired by John Hoyle, completed in 1993. The eight standards identified were: leadership and district culture, policy and governance, communications and community relations, organizational management, curriculum planning and development, instructional management, human resources management, and values and ethics of leadership. A total of 207 superintendents with at least three but not more than five years of experience were included in the study. ^ The findings associated with the research questions revealed that superintendents relied on prior <b>administrative</b> <b>experiences</b> significantly more than any of the other four variables to complete each key job responsibility. When all eight key job responsibilities were considered as a whole, prior <b>administrative</b> <b>experiences</b> were relied on significantly more than any other variable. Network of colleagues were relied on significantly more than professional and governmental organizations, research, and academic preparation. Research and academic preparation were relied on equally, but less so than any of the other variables. ...|$|R

5|$|One of Groves' early {{problems}} {{was to find}} a director for Project Y, the group that would design and build the bomb. The obvious choice was one of the three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence, or Compton, but they could not be spared. Compton recommended Oppenheimer, who was already intimately familiar with the bomb design concepts. However, Oppenheimer had little <b>administrative</b> <b>experience,</b> and, unlike Urey, Lawrence, and Compton, had not won a Nobel Prize, which many scientists felt that the head of such an important laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's security status, as many of his associates were Communists, including his brother, Frank Oppenheimer; his wife, Kitty; and his girlfriend, Jean Tatlock. A long conversation on a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director. Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{met with}} some initial success {{in his new}} role, {{learning}} Samoan and implementing a number of reforms. He focussed on transforming the country's economy into one based upon agriculture with a long term view of Samoan self-governance, and also implemented welfare and educational programs. His results were such that his term of three years in Western Samoa was extended by a further two years. He was also knighted, being made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the June 1925 Birthday Honours. However, {{over the next two}} years he had to deal with the increasing influence of the Mau movement, a nationalist group agitating for independence via peaceful means. While his <b>administrative</b> <b>experience</b> was helpful for carrying the reforms he had initiated, he lacked the political and diplomatic skills to deal with the Mau. He took a heavy handed approach to asserting his authority and deported several leaders of the Mau. This did not have the desired effect and dissent amongst the general population towards the New Zealand administration only increased. Richardson was forced to call in marines from the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy to deal with the civil unrest. Shortly afterwards, on 31 March 1928, he retired. Later in the year he was the New Zealand representative to the League of Nations meeting which discussed the administration of Western Samoa.|$|E

For our purpose, sixteen SPARCstation 5 / 85 are currently employed, which were originally intended to be replaced. Each workstation has a SCSI hard disk, which is easily installable with a convenient attachment. Considering this mechanism results in a unique laboratory for teaching administrative aspects of computer networking.

40|$|Background. Katz (1954, 1972) advises all leaders perform tasks {{requiring}} human, {{technical and}} conceptual abilities. Many leadership training {{programs have been}} premised upon this belief. Training administrators in community education is a fairly recent occurrence. Most of this training is occurring {{in the field of}} educational administration. However, DeLargy (1975) suggests leaders in community education perform different duties than other educators. Literature implies community educators may perform duties similar to those required by human service administrators. Past research is not available to support nor reject this inference. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine if the perceived human, technical and conceptual skills of community education administrators were more similar to the group they are trained with or to a group that performs similar tasks. The variables: sex of administrator, academic training and past <b>administrative</b> <b>experiences</b> were considered in analyzing the data. ^ Sample. Administrators in nine Massachusetts cities with 50, 000 to 100, 000 inhabitants and one certified community school were identified.

This study explored {{the influences of}} Black Greek-lettered organizations (BGLOs) on the persistence of African Americans at predominantly White institutions (PWIs). To investigate the relationships, {{emphasis was placed on}} social capital that may be gained through BGLO involvement. Nan Lin's (1999) network theory of social capital was used as the theoretical framework for the study. The theory highlights the idea that social capital is embedded in resources gained though social networks. Grounded theory - a qualitative research approach - was used in the study. Focus groups were conducted with four BGLOs, and a series of twenty-four one-on-one interviews were conducted with eight interview participants at a PWI in the Northeast. The study revealed that (1) relationships/connections, (2) increased social lives, (3) gaining community and <b>administrative</b> <b>experiences,</b> (4) academic monitoring, and (5) leadership development, which were all framed as "returns," influenced persistence in different ways.
