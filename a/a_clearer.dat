These {{included a}} more realistic film with <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> image {{of the future and}} deletion of allusions to God and Christianity. Tarkovsky successfully resisted such major changes, and after a few minor edits Solaris was approved for release in March 1972.|$|E
5|$|No. 11 Group moved No. 32, 54, 56, and 501 Squadrons, totalling 11 Spitfires and 33 Hurricanes, to the Margate-Canterbury line {{to engage}} the enemy {{formations}} first.

5|$|In the High Middle Ages, {{new sources}} of {{education}} arose. Choir and grammar schools were designed to train priests, with an emphasis respectively on music and Latin grammar. The reorganisation of the church {{that began in the}} reign of David I (1124–53) gave the church <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> diocesan and parochial structure, meaning that the seats of sheriffdoms, such as Perth, received schools that were usually under monastic patrons. Early examples of grammar schools include the High School of Glasgow in 1124 and the High School of Dundee in 1239. These were usually attached to cathedrals or a collegiate church. The newly created diocesan chancellors may have had authority over cathedral schools and schoolmasters within their diocese.|$|E

5|$|Narayan uses a sarangi {{obtained}} from Uday Lal and built in Meerut in the 1920s or 1930s in his concerts and recordings. He plays on foreign harp strings to produce <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> tone. Narayan experimented with modifications to his instrument {{and added a}} fourth string, but removed it because it hindered playing. In the 1940s, he exchanged gut with steel for the first string and {{found it easier to}} play, but reverted to using only gut strings because the steel string altered the sound.|$|E
5|$|These {{include two}} images {{that show the}} subject standing. One captures a full length view, in which the subject is unclothed except {{for a pair of}} {{stockings}} and shoes. In the other, the subject's right leg is raised to provide <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> view of the genitalia. Another image presents the subject lying back with one arm covering the face while someone else's hand pulls on the penile tissue. A similar photograph shows the subject in an examination position, with a hand– visible in the uncut photographic plate as belonging to Maisonneuve– spreading the vaginal lips. The series also includes a close-up of the subject's genitalia, with the legs open.|$|E
5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and was tall and narrow, allowing <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E
5000|$|In Dianetics, {{to explain}} the {{abilities}} of <b>a</b> <b>Clear,</b> Hubbard makes use of tropes and special idioms and draws the attention away by pointing to old colloquialisms as the [...] "mind's eye." [...] Hubbard uses such terms as [...] "optimum recall," [...] "optimum individual," [...] "... What <b>a</b> <b>Clear</b> can do easily, {{quite a few people}} have, from time to time, been partially able to do in the past.," [...] "... <b>A</b> <b>clear</b> uses imagination in its entirety," [...] "... Rationality, as divorced from aberration, can be studied in <b>a</b> <b>Cleared</b> person only," [...] <b>a</b> <b>Clear's</b> intelligence is above normal, <b>a</b> <b>Clear</b> is free from all aberrations and the attributes of <b>a</b> <b>Clear</b> have never been previously included in a study of man and man's inherent abilities. After faithfully enumerating all kinds of goodies about Clear, Hubbard finally admits [...] "... Until we obtain Clears, it remains obscure why such differences should exist" [...] as if no Clear has ever been made or no Clear ever made it. L. Ron Hubbard was extremely apt and able in using these tropes to suit Dianetics presentation of a new reality.|$|R

5|$|Astronomers such as David Morrison {{argue that}} the galactic equator is an entirely {{arbitrary}} line and can never be precisely drawn, because {{it is impossible to}} determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above , an altitude that gives <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to. Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, a few on Capitol Hill were {{determined}} to overhaul United States Special Operations Forces. They included Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and William Cohen (R-ME), both members of the Armed Services Committee, and Representative Dan Daniel (D-VA), {{the chairman of the}} United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment was not interested in special operations, that the country's capability in this area was second rate, and that SOF operational command and control was an endemic problem. Senators Nunn and Cohen also felt strongly that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> organizational focus and chain of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., acting-out disorders) show <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> link to delayed gratification, {{since they}} more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents, as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification, and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E

5|$|On 26 May 2017, {{the album}} was reissued for the album's 50th anniversary in four {{different}} formats: a single CD, a double CD set, a double vinyl set and a six-disc super deluxe edition. The first CD contains a new stereo remix of the album produced by Giles Martin. Created using modern and vintage technology, the 2017 mix retains more of the idiosyncrasies that were unique to the original mono version of Sgt. Pepper's. Unlike the original album, first-generation tapes were used rather than their subsequent mixdowns, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> and more spacious sound. The other discs contain alternative mixes and previously unreleased session tapes. The six-disc box set includes four CDs {{as well as a}} documentary and 5.1 surround sound mixes of the album in both DVD and Blu-ray form.|$|E
5|$|Others like Stroud, Krause and Phillips opine {{that even}} Rommel's {{recklessness}} and disobedience during {{the invasion of}} France benefitted the German cause, while rescuing Hitler's mercurial objectives and inventing the actual application of blitzkrieg ("lightning war"), and it was Hitler who downgraded strategic victory to operational victory. According to Alan J. Levine, contrary to the allegation {{that he was only}} a genius tactician without a good grasp of logistics, Rommel was <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> thinker than most of his colleagues (shown by his judgements on developing situations), and although he was the most defeatist German general, there was a serious qualification to his pessimism and he was capable of displaying a surprising amount of energy in building the Normandy defense at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} men in {{leadership}} positions {{were likely to be}} wounded or killed, soldiers learned the jobs of those beside and above them. At the British First Army headquarters, a large-scale plasticine model of the Vimy sector was constructed and used to show commissioned and senior non-commissioned officers the topographical features of the battlefield and details of the German trench system. In addition, upwards of 40,000 topographical trench maps were printed and distributed to ensure that even platoon sergeants and section commanders possessed a wider awareness of the battlefield. These measures gave each platoon <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> picture of how it fitted into the greater battle plan and in so doing, reduced the command and control problems that plagued First World War combat.|$|E

50|$|The name of {{the village}} of Lickey {{is thought to have}} derived from 'leac' (<b>a</b> <b>clearing)</b> and 'hey' (<b>an</b> {{enclosed}} space), perhaps referring to <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> in the forest. The area forms part of the Lickey Hills Country Park.|$|R
5|$|Shakespeare {{also uses}} sub-plots to offer <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> {{view of the}} actions of the main characters. For example, when the play begins, Romeo is in love with Rosaline, who has refused all of his advances. Romeo's infatuation with her stands in obvious {{contrast}} to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet's love and marriage. Paris' love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet's feelings for him and her feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way she talks about him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the sub-plot of the Montague–Capulet feud overarches the whole play, providing an atmosphere of hate that is the main contributor to the play's tragic end.|$|E
5|$|While {{only a few}} {{artifacts}} were recovered, historians {{said the}} dig offered <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> view of early 19th-century life at Colross. Discoveries included an underground domed brick cistern {{that served as a}} water purification system and evidence that slaves lived in outbuildings on the Colross estate. Archaeologists also discovered the mansion's original basement floor, which was laid in a herringbone bond. Evidence of the estate's exterior walls, the foundations of the smokehouse, stables, and a burial vault were also unearthed. In the northwestern portion of the property, what is thought to have been the foundation of a rectangular burial vault was found. No burial remains were discovered. All interments were presumably removed in the early 20th century. Thomson Francis Mason was originally interred at the Colross graveyard in 1838, as were two of his daughters. Subsequent residents had their remains reinterred at Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery in Alexandria. According to the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership, the delay in construiction caused 79 condominium buyers to abandon their purchases.|$|E
5|$|An {{official}} {{video for}} the remix version produced by HarDrum was {{included on the}} CD format of the single; it included unreleased footage that did not appear on the original version, featuring different angle shots of the girls, expressions from the public's faces and the band performing erratically. It also included various scenes of people on-set helping with the music video's production, and one holding the wired fence. In July and September 2015, the group uploaded two teaser videos of a remix version produced by Fly Dream in order to commemorate the single's 15th anniversary on 19 December that same year; by then, it still remained unreleased. On 7 August 2016, one year since the two trailers, t.A.T.u. uploaded an HD version of the video with new unreleased scenes and extended footage. Lasting five minutes and 37 seconds, it showed an extended cut of the girls arguing next to the brick wall and walking {{around the corner to}} find the vast Khodynka Field with <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> cityscape in the distance by the fourth minute. The ending of the video portrays t.A.T.u. in the distance, similar to the original video.|$|E
