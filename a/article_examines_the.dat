The <b>article</b> <b>examines</b> <b>the</b> {{political}} dimension {{of how the}} Common Sense Revolution was promoted and enacted. Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} Mike Harris as the catalyst of the reforms and the positive and negative feedback that he and his party received as a result. The article focuses on in-depth analysis of Conservative propaganda commercials and provides insight into how certain wide-scale reforms that diverged from tradition were seemingly accepted by the Ontario population and why policies like Bill 103 were so stringently opposed. The article concludes by noting that Harris’ image may have been more damaging to the Revolution than his far-reaching changes to the Ontario policy tradition.|$|E
