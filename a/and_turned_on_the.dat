5|$|Lazarus Malkoth (voiced by Keith Szarabajka): A Roman {{who first}} founded the Darkwatch society in 66 AD {{in order to}} battle the dark forces {{responsible}} for {{the decline of the}} Roman Empire. He eventually got possessed by a demon and himself became a powerful vampire <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> organization he founded, raising an undead army to aid him in his task. The Darkwatch then pursued Lazarus across Europe and later America. During the game's development, the villain's name was Scourge.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers <b>and,</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Butterfield was {{inducted}} into the Blues Foundation's Blues Hall of Fame, which noted that [...] "the albums released by the Butterfield Blues Band brought Chicago Blues to a generation of Rock fans during the 1960s and paved the way for late 1960s electric groups like Cream". [...] The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted the Paul Butterfield Blues Band in 2015.

500|$|In July 2005, Chris Wilson, the Internet Explorer Platform Architect, {{stated that}} passing Acid2 {{was not a}} {{priority}} for Internet Explorer 7, describing the test as a [...] "wish list" [...] of features rather than a true test of standards compliance. In December 2007, Microsoft announced that all the changes required to pass Acid2 would be made available in Internet Explorer 8, but that the changes would not be turned on by default, meaning that IE8 would not actually pass the test. The concern was that switching to a new behavior would cause too many problems in web pages expecting Internet Explorer's old, non-compliant behavior. Then in March 2008 Microsoft released IE8 beta 1 <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> changes by default after all. James Pratt, product manager for IE8, explained that this decision was made so that [...] "developers can spend more time building features and cool stuff, and less time just trying to tweak their sites across different browsers." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1890, the Bridegrooms {{had moved}} to the National League. Burns, now 26, led the league in home runs (13) and RBI (128). He hit for the cycle on August 1, 1890—becoming the first Bridegroom to do so. The team won the National League pennant, and faced the Louisville Colonels in the 1890 World Series. The series ended in a 3–3–1 tie: bad weather led to the {{cancellation}} of more games. After the 1891 season, Burns's 1892 RBI total was third in the league, and his hits, doubles, triples, and batting average marks were the second highest on the Brooklyn team, now named the Grooms. In 1893, between games of a doubleheader, a teammate of Burns, Tom Daly, was sleeping in center field when Burns stabbed Daly with a penknife. Daly awoke <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> knife, leading to a severed tendon which kept Daly out for two weeks. Burns' 1894 batting average (.355) was the highest of his career; his hit and run totals were also the second highest in his career. Burns continued to play for the club until 1895, when he played for the New York Giants. In his final MLB year, Burns batted a combined [...]258 over 25 games.|$|E

2500|$|Bain {{testified that}} after his morning paper run {{he entered the}} house without turning on the lights, and went downstairs to the {{bathroom}} where he washed his hands which were covered with black newsprint and put some clothes in the washing machine.
