Several defects related to isolated cobalt have been detected by electron paramagnetic resonance and photoluminescence, but their structure is yet unknown.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{transitions}} <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> sharp (~10meV) and strong. Consequently, it {{is relatively}} easy to selectively excite nanotubes having certain (n,m) indices, as well as to detect optical signals from individual nanotubes.|$|E
5|$|Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin– A well-off {{lawyer who}} is engaged to Raskolnikov's sister Dunya in the {{beginning}} of the novel. His motives for the marriage <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> despicable, as he states more or less that he chose her since she will be completely beholden to him financially. Luzhin represents immorality throughout the book, in contrast to Svidrigaïlov's amorality, and Raskolnikov's misguided morality.|$|E

5|$|The {{white-eyes}} are a {{large family}} of mostly Old World passerine birds. They <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> diverse in size and colouration, but are characterised by soft fluffy plumage.

5|$|At ambient {{conditions}} bismuth shares the same layered structure as the metallic forms of arsenic and antimony, crystallizing in the rhombohedral lattice (Pearson symbol hR6, space group Rm No. 166), {{which is often}} classed into trigonal or hexagonal crystal systems. When compressed at room temperature, this Bi-I structure changes first to the monoclinic Bi-II at 2.55 GPa, then to the tetragonal Bi-III at 2.7 GPa, and finally to the body-centered cubic Bi-IV at 7.7 GPa. The corresponding transitions can be monitored via changes in electrical conductivity; they <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> reproducible and abrupt, and are therefore used for calibration of high-pressure equipment.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the second}} period 8 element, unbinilium is {{predicted}} to be an alkaline earth metal, below beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium. Each of these elements has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital (valence electron configuration ns2), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +2 oxidation state: thus the alkaline earth metals <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> reactive elements, {{with the exception of}} beryllium due to its small size. Unbinilium is predicted to continue the trend and have a valence electron configuration of 8s2. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkaline earth metals in some properties.|$|E

5|$|Grown on agar plates, the mycelia of A.serialiformis and A.serialis have {{identical}} chemical reactivity, and <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> {{similar in}} appearance, although the authors {{note that the}} former's was more cottony than the latter's. The authors mated several combinations of North American collections using vegetative compatibility tests, and confirmed the presence of different mating alleles—indicating {{that all of the}} North American collections represented a single species. Similar pairings performed between North American and European collections showed the species to be incompatible, and therefore distinct.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Daniel Koshland {{suggested}} a modification to {{the lock and}} key model: since enzymes <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> flexible structures, the active site is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme. As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site; the amino acid side-chains {{that make up the}} active site are molded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some cases, such as glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site. The active site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge distribution is determined.|$|E
5|$|In Italy, the {{disconnect}} with local production {{has had an}} adverse effect on quality; for example, in the 1990s, some of the dried porcino mushrooms exported to Italy from China contained species of genus Tylopilus, which <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> similar in appearance, and when dried, are difficult for both mushroom labourers and mycologists alike to distinguish from Boletus. Tylopilus species typically have a very bitter taste, a bitterness that is imparted to the flavour of the porcini {{with which they are}} mixed.|$|E

5|$|Most {{molluscs}} {{have only}} one pair of gills, or even only one gill. Generally, the gills <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> like feathers in shape, although some species have gills with filaments on only one side. They divide the mantle cavity so water enters near the bottom and exits near the top. Their filaments have three kinds of cilia, one of which drives the water current through the mantle cavity, while the other two help to keep the gills clean. If the osphradia detect noxious chemicals or possibly sediment entering the mantle cavity, the gills' cilia may stop beating until the unwelcome intrusions have ceased. Each gill has an incoming blood vessel connected to the hemocoel and an outgoing one to the heart.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{alignments}} are {{not guaranteed}} to be globally optimal. The primary problem is that when errors are made at any stage in growing the MSA, these errors are then propagated through to the final result. Performance is also particularly bad {{when all of the}} sequences in the set <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> distantly related. Most modern progressive methods modify their scoring function with a secondary weighting function that assigns scaling factors to individual members of the query set in a nonlinear fashion based on their phylogenetic distance from their nearest neighbors. This corrects for non-random selection of the sequences given to the alignment program.|$|E
5|$|The Borneo shark is slim-bodied, with a long, pointed snout and oblique, slit-like {{nostrils}} {{preceded by}} narrow, nipple-shaped flaps of skin. The eyes <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> large and circular, and equipped with nictitating membranes. The {{corners of the}} sizable mouth bear short, indistinct furrows, and immediately above {{are a series of}} enlarged pores that are unique within the genus. There are 25–26 upper and 23–25 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth have a single, narrow, oblique cusp with strongly serrated edges, and large cusplets on the trailing side. The lower teeth are similar, but tend to be more slender and finely serrated. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
