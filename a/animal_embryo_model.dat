40|$|With {{the growing}} concern that {{environmental}} chemicals might impair {{human and animal}} fertility, {{it is important to}} investigate the possible influence of these substances on sexual differentiation and genital development of mammals. Many of these substances are suspected to interfere with endocrine processes, and exposure during critical periods of prenatal development might affect reproductive performance over several generations. Alkylphenols and their metabolites are lipophilic substances exerting apparent estrogenic action in in vitro and in vivo testing systems. With the widespread industrial use of alkylphenols, these are disseminated in the environment with sewage sludge, and domestic animals and humans are likely to be exposed via the food chain. Using the pig as an in vivo model, we studied the effect of intrauterine exposure to tertiary octylphenol (OP) on essential reproductive parameters over 3 generations. Sows were treated daily from D 23 to 85 of pregnancy with either 0, 10 or 1000 μg OP/kg body weight. Treatment with OP extended pregnancy length and induced basal cell proliferation in the cervical epithelium of the parental generation. In F 1 offspring of sows treated with the low dosage of OP, onset of puberty was accelerated. Furthermore, when F 1 gilts and F 1 boars originating from sows treated with high dosages of OP were bred, the litter size was reduced. The {{results of the present study}} are compared with previous reports on estrogenicity of OP, and the usefulness of in vivo <b>animal</b> or <b>embryo</b> <b>models</b> for the evaluation of possible consequences of human exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds is discussed. Furthermore, possible consequences of exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds for the embryo transfer industry are addressed...|$|R

40|$|Causes of {{chromosomal}} differences such as mosaicism between embryos {{developed in}} vivo and in vitro may be resolved using <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> to compare <b>embryos</b> generated in vivo with those generated by different production systems. The aims {{of this study}} were: (1) to test a ZOO-FISH approach (using bovine painting probes) to detect abnormal chromosome make-up in the sheep <b>embryo</b> <b>model,</b> and (2) to examine the extent of chromosome deviation in sheep embryos derived in vivo and in vitro. Cytogenetic analysis was performed on day 6 in-vivo and in-vitro derived sheep embryos using commercially available bovine chromosome painting probes for sex chromosomes X–Y and autosomes 1 – 29. A total of 8631 interphase and metaphase nuclei were analyzed from 49 in-vitro-derived and 51 in-vivo-derived embryos. The extent of deviation from normal ovine chromosome make-up was higher (p < 0. 05) in in-vitro-produced embryos relative to in-vivo-derived embryos (65. 3 % vs. 19. 6 % respectively) mainly due to diploid–polyploid mosaicism. Polyploid cells ranged from 3 n to 8 n with tetraploids most predominant among non-diploid cells. The proportions of polyploid cells per mixoploid embryo in in-vitro-produced embryos ranged from 1. 4 % to 30. 3 %, in contrast to less than 10 % among the in-vivo-derived embryos. It was concluded that in-vitro-derived embryos are vulnerable to ploidy change compared to their in-vivo counterparts.

The model was somewhat effective in that we found a relative increase of 30 % for implantation in the model-selected group of embryos. There was, however, a concomitant large rejection of embryos from our test cohort, which actually resulted in pregnancy.
