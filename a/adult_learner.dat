40|$|The {{number of}} <b>adult</b> <b>learners</b> {{entering}} or returning to {{institutions of higher}} education is increasing in general and in relation to the traditional student population, and projections suggest that the trend will continue. As automation and technology impact the labor force, educational access is becoming a national concern and a necessity for more <b>adult</b> <b>learners.</b> Access to higher education impacts minority and economically depressed populations disproportionally and increases the personal and professional success of adult students and the long-term prosperity of their families. Although Composition Studies has a history of recognizing and facilitating student populations as they enter the Academy, <b>adult</b> <b>learners</b> have been overlooked and marginalized within Composition Studies. Through analysis of the foundational disciplinary literature, my research establishes that <b>adult</b> <b>learners</b> played a pivotal {{role in the development of}} Composition Studies and argues that Composition Studies can and should play a pivotal role in the success of <b>adult</b> <b>learners</b> in higher education. Locating <b>adult</b> <b>learners</b> in the disciplinary literature and demonstrating their impact on the theories and practices of Composition Studies creates a collective resource of research on which to ground current approaches and from which to launch future research; connecting this literature to the larger literature on <b>adult</b> <b>learners</b> allows Composition to contribute to and benefit from Academy-wide efforts. Stated simply, the goal of this dissertation is to recognize and support <b>adult</b> <b>learners</b> in Composition Studies. Such work is imperative because Composition Studies is continuing to construct <b>adult</b> <b>learners</b> through deficiency narratives and overlook <b>adult</b> <b>learners</b> in the current literature and classroom practices, as evidenced by the research on student-veterans. As a result, I suggest addressing the disciplinary responsibility to <b>adult</b> <b>learners</b> immediately through programmatic responses to the needs of adults in Composition Studies and by using the acknowledgment of their presence to call for institutional resources in support of all <b>adult</b> <b>learners...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{addition}} to the common learning traits found in all <b>learners,</b> <b>adults</b> are often likely to display characteristics quite {{different from those of}} chHdren (Knowles, 1973, 1984; Westmeyer, 1988).

As instructors, we must recognize these adult learning characteristics in order to bring about effective instruction and to help insure that learning takes place. Active-Jearner: <b>Adult</b> <b>learners</b> are usually willing to participate in the learning process.

Expert: <b>Adult</b> <b>learners</b> can be classified as experts in many fields. Real~life experiences have contributed to their wide areas of expertise. Independent: <b>Adult</b> <b>learners</b> are capable of being more self-reliant. <b>Adult</b> <b>learners</b> operating as independent individuals tend to want to accomplish things for themselves.
