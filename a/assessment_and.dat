40|$|AIMS: This aim of {{this study}} was to obtain a {{consensus}} from clinicians regarding occupational therapy for people with depression, for the <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> practices they use that are not currently supported by research evidence directly related to functional performance. The study also aimed to discover how many of these <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> practices were currently supported by research evidence. METHODS: Following a previously reported systematic review of <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> practices used in occupational therapy for people with depression, a modified nominal group technique was used to discover which <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> practices occupational therapists currently utilize. Three online surveys gathered initial data on therapeutic options (survey 1), which were then ranked (survey 2) and re-ranked (survey 3) to gain the final consensus. Twelve therapists completed the first survey, whilst 10 clinicians completed both the second and third surveys. MAJOR FINDINGS: Only 30 % of the <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> practices identified by the clinicians were supported by research evidence. A consensus was obtained on a total of 35 other <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> interventions. These included both occupational-therapy-specific <b>and</b> generic <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> interventions. Principle conclusion. Very few of the <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> interventions identified were supported by research evidence directly related to functional performance.
