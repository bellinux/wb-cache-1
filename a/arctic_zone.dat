The classic example of a cline is the circle of subspecies of the gull Larus round the <b>Arctic</b> <b>zone.</b> This cline {{is an example of a}} ring species.Some of Huxley's last contributions to the evolutionary synthesis were on the subject of ecological genetics. He noted how surprisingly widespread polymorphism is in nature, with visible morphism much more prevalent in some groups than others. The immense diversity of colour and pattern in small bivalve molluscs, brittlestars, sea-anemones, tubicular polychaetes and various grasshoppers is perhaps maintained by making recognition by predators more difficult.|$|E

60|$|It follows, therefore, that if {{periods of}} high excentricity, like that {{which appears to}} have been {{synchronous}} with our last glacial epoch and is generally admitted to have been one of its efficient causes, always produced glacial epochs (with or without alternating warm periods), then the whole of the Tertiary deposits in the north temperate and <b>Arctic</b> <b>zones</b> should exhibit frequent alternations of boulder and rock-bearing beds, or coarse rock-strewn gravels analogous to our existing glacial drift, and with some corresponding change of organic remains. Let us then see what evidence can be adduced of the existence of such deposits, and whether it is adequate to support the {67} theory of repeated glacial epochs during the Tertiary period.|$|R
60|$|Temperate Climates in the Arctic Regions.--As we {{have just}} seen, the {{geological}} evidence of the persistence of sub-tropical or warm climates in the north temperate zone during {{the greater part of}} the Tertiary period is almost irresistible, and we have now to consider the still more extraordinary series of observations which demonstrate that this amelioration of climate extended into the <b>Arctic</b> <b>zone,</b> and into countries now almost wholly buried in snow and ice. These warm Arctic climates have been explained by Dr. Croll as due to periods of high excentricity with winter in perihelion, a theory which implies alternating {71} epochs of glaciation far exceeding what now prevails; and it is therefore necessary to examine the evidence pretty closely in order to see if this view is more tenable {{in the case of the}} north polar regions than we have found it to be in that of the north temperate zone.|$|E
6000|$|Now it {{is quite}} {{impossible}} to ignore or evade the force of this testimony as to the continuous warm climates of the north temperate and polar zones throughout Tertiary times. The evidence extends over a vast area, both in space and time, it {{is derived from the}} work of the most competent living geologists, and it is absolutely consistent in its general tendency. We have in the Lower Cretaceous period an almost tropical climate in France and England, a somewhat lower temperature in the United States, and a mild insular climate in the Arctic regions. In each successive period the climate becomes somewhat less tropical; but down to the Upper Miocene it remains warm temperate in Central Europe, and cold temperate within the polar area, with not a trace of any intervening periods of Arctic cold. It then gradually cools down and merges through the Pliocene into the glacial epoch in Europe, while in the <b>Arctic</b> <b>zone</b> there is a break in the record between the Miocene and the recent glacial deposits.[20] ...|$|E

60|$|Overlapping areas {{among the}} species of a genus {{is a more}} common phenomenon, and is almost {{universal}} where these species are numerous in the same continent. It is, however, exceedingly irregular, so that we often find one {19} species extending over a considerable portion of the area occupied by the genus and including the entire areas {{of some of the}} other species. So little has been done to work out accurately the limits of species that {{it is very difficult to}} give examples. One of the best is to be found in the genus Dendroeca, a group of American wood-warblers. These little birds all migrate in the winter into the tropical regions, but in the summer they come north, each having its particular range. Thus, D. dominica comes as far as the middle Eastern States, D. coerulea keeps west of the Alleghanies, D. discolor comes to Michigan and New England; four other species go farther north in Canada, while several extend to the borders of the <b>Arctic</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
60|$|If, {{however, the}} greater continents {{have become more}} compact and massive from age to age, and have {{received}} their chief extensions northward at a comparatively recent period, while the Antarctic lands had a corresponding but somewhat earlier development, {{we have all the}} conditions requisite to explain the persistence, with slight fluctuations, of warm climates far into the north-polar area throughout PalÃ¦ozoic, Mesozoic, and Tertiary times. At length, during {{the latter part of the}} Tertiary epoch, a considerable elevation took place, closing up several of the water passages to the north, and raising up extensive areas in the Arctic regions to become the receptacle of snow and ice-fields. This elevation is indicated by the abundance of Miocene and the absence of Pliocene deposits in the <b>Arctic</b> <b>zone</b> and the considerable altitude of many Miocene rocks in Europe and North America; and the occurrence at this time of a long-continued period of high excentricity necessarily brought on the glacial epoch in the manner already described in our last chapter. A depression seems to have occurred during the glacial period itself in North America as in Britain, but this may have been due partly to the weight of the ice and partly to a rise of the ocean {96} level caused by the earth's centre of gravity being shifted towards the north.|$|E
60|$|We {{descended to}} Yeumtong {{in a cold}} drizzle, {{arriving}} by sunset; we remained through the following day, hoping to explore the lower glacier {{on the opposite side}} of the valley: which, however, the weather entirely prevented. I have before mentioned (chapter xxiii) that in descending in autumn from the drier and more sunny rearward Sikkim valleys, the vegetation is found to be most backward in the lowest and dampest regions. On this occasion, I found asters, grasses, polygonums, and other plants that were withered, brown, and seeding at Momay (14,000 to 15,000 feet), at Yeumtong (12,000 feet) green and unripe; and 2000 feet lower still, at Lachoong, the contrast was even more marked. Thus the short backward spring and summer of the <b>Arctic</b> <b>zone</b> is overtaken by an early and forward seed-time and winter: so far as regards the effects of mean temperature, the warmer station is in autumn more backward than the colder. This is everywhere obvious in the prevalent plants of each, and is especially recognisable in the rhododendrons; as the following table shows:-- 16,000 to 17,000 feet, R. nivale flowers in July; fruits in September=2 months. 13,000 to 14,000 feet, R. anthopogon flowers in June; fruits in Oct.=4 months. 11,000 to 12,000 feet, R. campanulatum flowers in May; fruits in Nov.=8 months. 8,000 to 9,000 feet, R. argenteum flowers in April; fruits in Dec.=8 months.|$|E
