40|$|The {{object of}} this {{bulletin}} {{is to bring}} to the attention of owners of <b>alkali</b> <b>land</b> the crop plants which are most likely to give satisfactory results. It can not be too emphatically stated that crop production on such soils is at best precarious. For this reason and because the alkali resistance of plants depends upon many varying conditions, it is impossible to offer more than suggestions as to what crops are best worth trying. " [...] p. 5 - 6. Topics discussed include the effects of alkali upon plant growth, plants well-adapted to alkaline soils, and alkali resistance in different types of plants...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{additional}} water {{required for}} the reclamation of agricultural lands might not be available in adequate quantities and at an appropriate time. Since the demand for the limited water in arid and semi-arid regions is increasing, it calls for in-situ conservation of rainwater. A rainwater conservation technology is proposed that form {{a part of the}} <b>alkali</b> <b>land</b> reclamation programs. This technology if adopted, could conserve more than 80 % of the rainwater in the area where it falls. On-farm development activities and leaching with saline water that occur naturally are proposed for in-situ conservation of rainfall to leach saline soils. The rainwater utilization for leaching in this manner could almost be doubled. Use of saline water for leaching is also highlighted. With this approach, a 15 %â€” 40 % saving in the fresh water requirement could be attained. A pitcher irrigation technique for irrigation with saline water is also described. It is shown that highly saline water even up to 15 dS/m EC could be used to grow salt sensitive vegetable crops. Some of these technologies could be extended to normal lands to augment the scarce natural resource, minimize drainage and avoid flooding at the tail ends...|$|E
50|$|The Iranian {{government}} has a project under development to put the water to agricultural use by altering the watercourse of the Talkheh-Roud away from the <b>alkali</b> <b>lands.</b> As part of this project, the Madani dam is being constructed on the Talkheh-Roud on the north-east side of Eynali mountain, which lies to the north-east of Tabriz.|$|R
50|$|One way of {{reducing}} sodium carbonate is to cultivate glasswort or saltwort or barilla plants. These plants sequester the sodium carbonate they absorb from alkali soil into their tissues. The ash {{of these plants}} contains good quantity of sodium carbonate which can be commercially extracted and used in place of sodium carbonate derived from common salt which is highly energy intensive process. Thus <b>alkali</b> <b>lands</b> deterioration can be checked by cultivating barilla plants which can serve as food source, biomass fuel and raw material for soda ash and potash, etc.|$|R
40|$|Limited {{work has}} been done in the country on the {{application}} of EM- 38 for survey and mapping of salt affected soils. Nonetheless during the last few years {{work has been}} reported at least from three places in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Delhi. The work is of similar nature but these studies have been covered as a part of this paper. It has been reported that with proper calibration and equation development, EM- 38 could be a useful tool for quick diagnostic surveys in the country. In our opinion, the application of EM- 38 has not picked up in India because {{of the cost of the}} instrument, its limited application in the mapping of <b>alkali</b> <b>lands</b> and general limitation of after sales service of the imported equipment. It seems that with emphasis on the mapping of salt affected soils of the country, its use should gain momentum. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study {{presented}} in this thesis was to find a salt and alkali tolerant crop and to evaluate some of those crop varieties now grown as to their ability to tolerate the salt and alkali conditions present in many Platte Valley soils. It is hoped that by the results obtained in this study better recommendations can be given to the agricultural producers who are faced with the problems of salty and <b>alkali</b> <b>lands.</b> From {{the results of this study}} it appears that for a plant to be economically stable in its production where alkali or saline conditions are prevalent, it must: (a) be able to tolerate the kinds and concentrations of salts present in the saline or alkali soil; (b) be able to germinate and emerge under the very critical conditions that often accompany saline or alkali conditions; (c) be able to withstand the physical stresses that often occur where saline or alkali conditions prevail; and (d) produce a final product that is of good quality and usable to the producer.

40|$|Now, {{slightly}} {{more than a hundred}} years since irrigation was first started in the West, many of the low-lying valley lands produce only poor quality pasture grasses because of waterlogging, salinity, and <b>alkali.</b> Other <b>lands</b> now produce only light crops of wild hay, and still other land areas are almost wholly non-productive because of the concentration of excessive quantities of harmful salts. This waterlogging is largely a result of irrigation on the higher lands, although rain and snow waters aggravate the situation. The water not used by the highland crops seeps into the lower areas, bringing harmful salts to the surface of the soil. This makes crop production difficult both because of lack of soil aeration and because of harmful salts...|$|R
