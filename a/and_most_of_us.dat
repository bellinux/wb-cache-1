Another split was located between Athens, Ohio and Ellenboro, West Virginia from the late 1920s to the mid-1930s, when US 50 went back to its original southern route; that U.S. Route 50N is now Ohio State Route 550 and part of West Virginia Route 16.|$|E

Kelli Kennedy writing for the Associated Press noted that Beyoncé [...] "slays at tour opening" [...] and further commented [...] "her commanding performance of [...] "Freedom" [...] served as reminder {{to the world that}} she 'breaks chains all by myself.

Becky Randel of Billboard felt that emotion guided the mood for the evening and stated that [...] "Bey was overcome when the audience knew all the lyrics to her new song, [...] "Hold Up" [...] and she often stopped to smile or nod at her exuberant BeyHive. Writing for Rolling Stone, Kat Bein said Beyoncé was [...] "a prime example of entertainment and a vision of an artist at her apex" [...] and later commented [...] "the show was a visual feast as well as an emotional tour de force, packed with fireworks, confetti, rearranging stage designs and aerial dancers".|$|E
500|$|When the U.S. Highways {{were first}} {{established}} in 1926, US 12 ended in Miles City, Montana, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>US</b> 12's current routing in Washington {{was followed by}} US 410. U.S. Route 12 was extended westward in stages; an extension to Lewiston, Idaho, was approved on June 19, 1962. [...] At various times in the early 1960s, the states of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon submitted plans for further westward extension to the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) to either Vancouver, Washington or Boardman, Oregon—or, a plan submitted in 1963 had the highway going {{only as far as}} Pasco—but all of these plans were rejected. Washington introduced a new system of sign route numbers in 1964. While US 410 was still signed as such, present US 12 became State Route 8 between US 410 at Elma and US 99/I-5 at Grand Mound and State Route 14 between US 99/I-5 at Chehalis and US 410 at Naches. The extension of US 12 to Aberdeen was finally approved on June 20, 1967, with US 12 taking over much of US 410's former routing. However, where US 410 had crossed the Cascades at Chinook Pass, US 12 used the all-weather White Pass, replacing SR 8 and SR 14. Signs were changed in late December 1967, and the bypassed segments of US 410 became a new SR 8 between Elma and Olympia, and SR 410 between Tacoma and Naches.|$|E

2500|$|By the 83rd Minnesota Legislative Session Lindner {{had already}} faced an ethics {{complaint}} before. This {{was a result}} of his reaction to the request of Rep. Paymar. His first complaint stemmed from a May 2000 incident after the Republican Party took control of the House and some members felt that the prayers opening the session were becoming too sectarian. [...] "For many, things went too far when House leaders recently brought in a choir to open the day's session with a musical rendition of the Apostles' Creed." [...] In light of this Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) who is Jewish said [...] "I would like {{to be part of that}} moment where a religious leader gets up before us and has a prayer. But I would like that to be non-denominational, and I would like it to be respectful of who I am." [...] In response to his and others' concerns a rule was passed [...] "requiring that in the future, prayer be non-denominational." [...] In responding to Paymar, Lindner said [...] "You know, we're told there's one God and one mediator between God and man. That man is Jesus Christ. <b>And</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> here are Christians. And we shouldn't be left not able to pray in the name of our God....And if you don't like it, you may have to like it-Or just don't come. I don't come sometimes for some prayers here....We have that privilege, and you need to exercise it. But don't impose your irreligious left views on me." [...] Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), called on Lindner [...] "to rethink his comments. When Lindner refused to reply, Entenza put forth a 'protest of dissent' petition asking the House Ethics Committee to reprimand Lindner. It was signed by 60 House members, including eight Republicans." [...] Later “The ethics panel found the comments ‘regrettable’, but took no disciplinary action.” ...|$|E
