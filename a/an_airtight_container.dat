5|$|After another full {{examination}} in 1911, with {{comparisons to}} the Ashmolean head, archaeologists dismissed the Ashmolean head as a fake. The absence of firm {{evidence of the}} whereabouts of Cromwell's head between 1684 and 1787 made them wary about declaring the head genuine. They concluded their study unable to verify or refute the head's identity. The uncertainty increased public demand for a full scientific examination, and Wilkinson reluctantly allowed the head to be taken for examination by the eugenicist Karl Pearson and the anthropologist Geoffrey Morant. Their 109-page report {{concluded that there was}} a “moral certainty” that the Wilkinson head was that of Oliver Cromwell. Horace Wilkinson died in 1957, bequeathing the head to his son, also called Horace. Horace Wilkinson wished to organise a proper burial for the head rather than a public display, so he contacted Sidney Sussex College, which welcomed the burial. There it was interred on 25 March 1960, in a secret location near the antechapel, preserved in the oak box in which the Wilkinson family had kept the head since 1815. The box was placed into <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> and buried with only a few witnesses, including family and representatives of the college. The secret burial was not announced until October 1962.|$|E
25|$|Leftover {{decorated}} pavlova can be refrigerated overnight, but {{the dessert}} will absorb moisture and lose its crispness. Undecorated pavlova {{can be left}} overnight in the oven, or for several days in <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container,</b> to be decorated when ready.|$|E
25|$|Coffee is best {{stored in}} <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> made of ceramic, glass, or {{non-reactive}} metal. Higher quality prepackaged coffee usually has a one-way valve which prevents air from entering while allowing the coffee to release gases. Coffee freshness and flavor is preserved {{when it is}} stored away from moisture, heat, and light. The ability of coffee to absorb strong smells from food means {{that it should be}} kept away from such smells. Storage of coffee in the refrigerator is not recommended due to the presence of moisture which can cause deterioration. Exterior walls of buildings which face the sun may heat the interior of a home, and this heat may damage coffee stored near such a wall. Heat from nearby ovens also harms stored coffee.|$|E

25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container.</b> Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E
25|$|Being a {{phosphate}} mineral, turquoise {{is inherently}} fragile and sensitive to solvents; perfume and other cosmetics will attack the finish and may alter the colour of turquoise gems, as will skin oils, as will most commercial jewellery cleaning fluids. Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight may also discolour or dehydrate turquoise. Care {{should therefore be}} taken when wearing such jewels: cosmetics, including sunscreen and hair spray, should be applied before putting on turquoise jewellery, and {{they should not be}} worn to a beach or other sun-bathed environment. After use, turquoise should be gently cleaned with a soft cloth to avoid a buildup of residue, and should be stored in its own container to avoid scratching by harder gems. Turquoise can also be adversely affected if stored in <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Infected human {{red blood}} cells are {{incubated}} in a culture dish or flask at 37°C together with a nutrient medium and plasma, serum or serum substitutes. A special feature of the incubation is the special gas mixture of mostly nitrogen (93% nitrogen, 4% carbondioxide, [...] 3% oxygen) allowing the parasites to grow at 37°C in a cell incubator. An alternative to gasing the cultures with the exact gas mixture, {{is the use of}} a candlejar. The candlejar is <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> in which the cultures and a lit candle are placed. The burning candle consumes some of the oxygen and produces carbon dioxide (...) , which acts as a fire extinguisher. Carbon dioxide content in fresh air varies between 0.036% and 0.039%, at an app. 5% [...] concentration the candle stops burning. The number of parasites increased by a factor 5 approximately every 48 hours (= one cycle). The parasitemia can be determined via blood film, to keep it within the wanted limits, the culture can be thinned out with healthy {{red blood cells}}.|$|E

50|$|The factory on Sturt Street, between Russell and Norman streets, was by 1875 {{turning out}} 30 tons of soap and 6 tons of candles per week. The process of boiling down fat and tallow {{produces}} some particularly foul odours, and Tidmarsh was diligent in reducing this nuisance {{to a minimum}} by ventilating the vats through charcoal or quicklime.

2500|$|UHT, {{also known}} as ultra-heat-treating, {{processing}} holds the milk at a temperature of 140°C (284°F) for four seconds. During UHT processing milk is sterilized and not pasteurized. This process lets consumers store milk or juice for several months without refrigeration. The process is achieved by spraying the milk or juice through a nozzle into a chamber filled with high-temperature steam under pressure. [...] After the temperature reaches 140°C the fluid is cooled instantly in a vacuum chamber, and packed in <b>a</b> pre-sterilized <b>airtight</b> <b>container.</b> Milk labeled [...] "ultra-pasteurized" [...] or simply [...] "UHT" [...] has been treated with the UHT method.|$|R
2500|$|Quality {{gasoline}} {{should be}} stable {{for six months}} if stored properly but gasoline will break down slowly over time due to {{the separation of the}} components. Gasoline stored for a year will most likely be able to be burned in an internal combustion engine without too much trouble but the effects of long term storage will become more noticeable with each passing month until a time comes when the gasoline should be diluted with ever-increasing amounts of freshly made fuel so that the older gasoline may be used up. If left undiluted, improper operation will occur and this may include engine damage from misfiring and/or the lack of proper action of the fuel within a fuel injection system and from an onboard computer attempting to compensate (if applicable to the vehicle). Storage should be in <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> (to prevent oxidation or water vapors mixing in with the gas) that can withstand the vapor pressure of the gasoline without venting (to prevent the loss of the more volatile fractions) at a stable cool temperature (to reduce the excess pressure from liquid expansion, and to reduce the rate of any decomposition reactions). When gasoline is not stored correctly, gums and solids may be created, which can corrode system components and accumulate on wetted surfaces, resulting in a condition called [...] "stale fuel". Gasoline containing ethanol is especially subject to absorbing atmospheric moisture, then forming gums, solids, or two phases (a hydrocarbon phase floating on top of a water-alcohol phase).|$|E

5000|$|Cannabis {{is fully}} dry for [...] "curing" [...] when the {{moisture}} level reaches 55%-62% RH. A {{simple way to}} check this is by closing the cannabis up in <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> glass <b>container</b> with <b>a</b> hygrometer. The container is stored for 12 hours at 22 °C (72 °F) and the hygrometer checked. 62% and above readings mean the jar needs to be opened {{for a few hours}} and then closed up, to allow more moisture to escape. The jar is again checked after 12 hours and the process repeated until a steady 55% is reached.|$|R
50|$|Once {{a coffee}} bean is roasted, {{it is either}} {{packaged}} immediately for sale, or ground and then packaged for sale. Packages used are typically either <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> plastic <b>container</b> or vacuum-sealed wrapping, or a folded-over bag with a pressure relief valve. Each type of package has its own advantages. The <b>airtight</b> <b>containers</b> allow maximum freshness of the bean and prolong its shelf life, whilst the valve allows excess carbon dioxide, and other gases to escape. The carbon dioxide, as much as 10 L/kg of coffee for dark-roasted coffee, is not released because it is harmful to the flavour—quite the contrary, it protects the beans against oxidation, but excess pressure could damage the container. Reported experience is that {{a few days of}} carbon dioxide release is needed between roasting and brewing for best results. There is also informed opinion that storage of freshly roasted beans in a can pressurized with nitrogen gas, with excess pressure buildup vented via a relief valve, provides optimal storage for extended periods, while promoting a beneficial aging effect related to distribution of natural oils by the pressure.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{variation}} is cold brew coffee, sometimes known as [...] "cold press." [...] Cold water is poured over coffee grounds {{and allowed to}} steep for eight to twenty-four hours. The coffee is then filtered, usually through a very thick filter, removing all particles. This process produces a very strong concentrate which {{can be stored in}} <b>a</b> refrigerated, <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> for up to eight weeks. The coffee can then be prepared for drinking by adding hot water to the concentrate at a water-to-concentrate ratio of approximately 3:1, but can be adjusted to the drinker's preference. The coffee prepared by this method is very low in acidity with a smooth taste, and is often preferred by those with sensitive stomachs. Others, however, feel this method strips coffee of its bold flavor and character. Thus, this method is not common, and there are few appliances designed for it.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} the technique {{and reliability of}} measuring digital blood pressure by means of <b>a</b> rigid, <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> (<b>a</b> bladder-free cuff) and a photocell placed on the digit. As cuff pressure increased, the position of digits in the cuff was maintained in the hand by fixing one or two fingers in-side the cuff and, in the foot, by using a supporting stick to keep {{the distance from the}} cuff to the bed constant. An airtight seal inside the cuff was achieved using a thin rubber sleeve and adhesive tape. Blood pressures letermined by the bladder-free cuff correlated well with those obtained by the conventional cuff with bladder. By using the bladder-free cuff, blood pressure could in all toes. BLOOD PRESSURE can be measured by direct and indirect methods. In the indirect technique, blood pressure is generally determined by placing a cuff around the part of the limb to be measured and a pulse sensor distal to the cuff. The indirect method has been widely used in measuring the segmental limb blood pressure by using various types of plethysmography o...|$|R
30|$|The sago hampas waste used in {{this study}} was {{obtained}} from a sago processing plant in Ukong, Tutong District, Brunei Darussalam. When used on a dry basis, sago hampas contains 58  % starch, 23  % cellulose, 9.2  % hemicellulose and 4  % lignin [28]. Sago hampas is the starchy lignocellulosic by-product from the pith of Metroxylon sagu (sago palm) following the starch extraction process [26]. Sago waste collected from the processing plant was washed repeatedly with distilled water to remove soluble impurities, such as excess starch, and solid wastes from the industrial process including adhering dirt and debris. The sago waste was then dried to drain excess water and then further dried in an 80  °C oven for 24  h prior to storage. The dried biomass was ground using a laboratory blender to a fine powder and screened with a standard sieve size to ensure that particle sizes were not greater than 350  µm. The powdered biomass was stored in <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> plastic <b>container</b> and used for batch adsorption tests and characterization.
