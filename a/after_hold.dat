2500|$|On 6 April 1917, the day Congress {{declared}} war on Germany, Itasca was in the harbor at San Juan, Puerto Rico and prevented the interned German ship KD-III from being scuttled by her crew. Heroic efforts by the engineer division of Itasca managed to block the sabotaged sea valves in the engine room of KD-III even though the valves were under several feet of seawater. With the flooding finally under control, there was [...] {{of water in the}} <b>after</b> <b>hold</b> and [...] in the forward hold. Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels commended the Itasca salvage team and gave the leader of the team, First Lieutenant (Eng.) Carl M. Green a special letter of commendation. With the declaration of war, Itasca was reassigned to the Fourth Naval District headquartered at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and refit for anti-submarine service with the addition of three-inch rapid fire guns and a Y-gun for launching depth charges. She was assigned patrol duties from the southern New Jersey coast to the entrance of Delaware Bay based out of Cold Spring, New Jersey. After the armistice, Itasca returned to the academy as a training vessel, but a shortage of personnel prevented her from being manned. Her last training cruise was completed during the summer of 1920 arriving in New London on 3 October. A replacement training vessel, the former barkentine-rigged gunboat [...] was acquired from the Navy on 1 July 1921 and renamed Alexander Hamilton on 18 August 1922. Itasca was decommissioned and sold in Baltimore, Maryland for $8250.00 on 11 May 1922 to Mr. Charles A. Jarding.|$|E

60|$|Reuben {{went back}} in the {{forecastle}} and got some tools, a piece of old sailcloth, and a large bundle of oakum; and then made his way with the two sailors down into the <b>after</b> <b>hold.</b> The {{way in which the}} upper tier of cargo lay heaped against the sides showed that it would, as the captain said, have been impossible to enter while the motion was at its worst. The rolling, however, had greatly diminished; the vessel rising and falling with a regular motion, as each wave passed under her.

60|$|This, indeed, {{proved to}} be the case, the garrisons of the castles dwindled away, and hold <b>after</b> <b>hold</b> fell without resistance.

These men were told that, after the troubles were over, they should again be taken into the service if they chose; but that, in the present state of things, one traitor might endanger the safety of the castle and town; and that, as {{it was impossible to tell}} who were true men and who had been corrupted by Glendower's agents, it was necessary that all should suffer, even if innocent.|$|E

After all, it's quite likely that one's dollars aren't worth what you lay out to get them, now and then, but that's {{certainly}} not the question. The boat's not making the water I expected, but we haven't found the gum, and engine room and <b>after</b> <b>hold</b> are still almost full. The boiler, as you know, has two or three tubes blowing, and {{we have nothing to}} stop them with. That means she's wasting half her steam, and as we have to keep a full head for the pump and winch, the coal's just melting. By the time we heave her off there will be very little left, and I've no fancy for going to sea short of fuel and being picked up as salvage. It's a point that has been worrying me lately." ...|$|E
60|$|He now pressed {{with his}} {{knuckles}} upon a certain spot of the carpet {{in one corner}} of the space just mentioned, letting me know that a portion of the flooring, about sixteen inches square, had been neatly cut out and again adjusted. As he pressed, this portion rose up at one end sufficiently to allow the passage of his finger beneath. In this manner he raised the mouth of the trap (to which the carpet was still fastened by tacks), and I found that it led into the <b>after</b> <b>hold.</b> He next lit a small taper by means of a phosphorous match, and, placing the light in a dark lantern, descended with it through the opening, bidding me follow. I did so, and he then pulled the cover upon the hole, by means of a nail driven into the under side--the carpet, of course, resuming its original position on the floor of the stateroom, and all traces of the aperture being concealed.|$|E
6000|$|... "And the Lord set a mark upon Cain." [...] What {{the opinion}} of others is about this mark, I know not; to me it seems like those in Timothy, who had [...] "their {{conscience}} seared with a hot iron" [...] (1 Tim 4:2). Which words are an allusion to {{the way of the}} magistrates in their dealing with rogues and felons; who that they may be known to all, are either in the hand, shoulder, or cheek branded with a hot iron. So Cain was marked of God for a reprobate, for one that had murdered a righteous man, even of envy to the goodness of his work: But the mark (as it was on those in Timothy) was not on any outward or visible part of his body, but (as there the apostle expresseth it) even upon his very conscience; his conscience then had received the fire-mark of the wrath and displeasure of God, which, as a burning iron doth to the flesh, had left such deep impression therein, that it abode as a scar or brand upon him, in token that good would for ever <b>after</b> <b>hold</b> him for a fugitive rogue or vagabond.|$|E

6000|$|... “Very well,” he said. “When Hank {{mentioned}} his discovery I thought I {{saw an opportunity}} of the kind I’d been waiting for; and I took some trouble {{to find out what}} I could about the vessel. She was an old wooden propeller that came round Cape Horn a good many years ago. When she couldn’t compete with modern steamboats, they strengthened her for a whaler, and she knocked about the Polar Sea; but she burned too much coal for that business, and wouldn’t work well under sail. It looked as if there wasn’t a trade in which she could make a living; but the Klondyke rush began, and somebody bought her cheap, and ran her up to Juneau, in Alaska, and afterward to Nome. There were better boats, but they were packed full, fore and aft, and the crowd going north was not fastidious: all it wanted was to get on the goldfields as soon as possible. Well, she made a number of trips all right, though I believe her owners had trouble when the pressure eased and the United States passenger-carrying regulations began to be properly applied. It was probably because no other boat was available that a small mining syndicate, which seems to have done pretty well, shipped a quantity of gold down from the north in her. Besides this, she brought out a number of miners, who had been more or less successful. Something went wrong with the engines when she had been a day or two at sea; but they got sail on her, and she drove south before a fresh gale until she struck the reef on a hazy night. It broke her back, and the <b>after</b> <b>hold</b> was flooded a few minutes after she struck. The strong-room was under water, {{there was no time to}} cut down to it; but they got the boats away, and after the crew and passengers were picked up, a San Francisco salvage company thought it worth while to attempt the recovery of the gold. It was late in the season when their tug reached the spot, and the ice drove her off the reef; the sea was generally heavy, and after a week or two they threw up the contract. The underwriters paid all losses, and that was the end of the matter. It is only the drifting of the stern half into shoal water that gives us our chance. Now I think you know as much as I do.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was never}} served so before without giving a hard blow for it," [...] muttered Stubb, as {{he found himself}} {{descending}} the cabin-scuttle. [...] "It's very queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don't well know whether {{to go back and}} strike him, or--what's that?-- down here on my knees and pray for him? Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but {{it would be the first}} time I ever did pray. It's queer; very queer; and he's queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, he's about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How he flashed at me!--his eyes like powder-pans! is he mad! Anyway there's something's on his mind, as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don't sleep then. Didn't that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man's hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it? A hot old man! I guess he's got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it's a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say-- worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I don't know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it. He's full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the <b>after</b> <b>hold</b> for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what's that for, I should like to know? Who's made appointments with him in the hold? Ain't that queer, now? But there's no telling, it's the old game-- Here goes for a snooze. Damn me, it's worth a fellow's while to be born into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think of it, that's about the first thing babies do, and that's a sort of queer, too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of 'em. But that's against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth--So here goes again. But how's that? didn't he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that! He might as well have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he did kick me, and I didn't observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil's the matter with me? I don't stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though--How? how? how?-- but the only way's to stash it; so here goes to hammock again; and in the morning, I'll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight." ...|$|E
