40|$|This study aims at apprehending the {{contribution}} of recreational activities {{in the treatment of}} hospitalized cancer patients and identifying the most stimulating resources for them. This is a qualitative research of phenomenological nature, it was approved by the Ethics in Research Committee, Protocol 139 / 2010. It was conducted with patients with cancer in a general hospital, located in Alfenas, in March and April, 2011. The research began from these guiding questions: What <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> the recreational team work and the activities they do? What do you suggest for this group to be developed? It was perceived that ludic activities help patients to face the disease, that they eased the interaction between the recreational group and the multiprofessional team, besides providing a happy and welcoming environment. The most well accepted activities were music and games the clowns provided. We suggest implementing the humanization by using ludic resources...|$|E
40|$|The {{daughter}} {{of one of}} my patients was describing hermother’s code status, “She is do-not-resuscitate anddo-not-incubate, but it’s ok to place central lines and ok to give pressors, but no femoral lines because we have had problems with those in the past — only the neck or under the collarbone. And she really doesn’t do well on dopamine, so can we avoid that? I think we should start with levo, then maybe phenylephrine. Are you writing this down? ” On my printed sign-out, I summarized, “DNR/DNI, lines OK, pressors OK, prefer Levofed. ” The rise of the à la carte code status alarms me. How had this daughter — like so many other spouses, children, siblings and powers of attorney I’d encountered — come to know her mother’s preferences regarding the intricacies of critical care medicine?

The methods in this component also included cab walkthroughs, driving observations, and unstructured interviews, and these were undertaken as previously described. However, this component also included a series of focus groups. These lasted 1.5 – 2  h, conducted with 4 – 6 tram drivers per group, and included a scenario simulation task [20]. This task required each of the participants to create challenging driving scenarios, as a means to overcome conversation-based limitation, but also stimulate situational insight. These methods has been previously applied in the heavy rail industry and have been very effective for identifying specific cognitive task demands, and illustrating how driver’s stabilise the task in the face of conflicting goals [20]. Example questions for the general focus group were “What <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> the [specific class] tram?” and “take me through a challenging part of a route that you drive over.” Example questions for the scenario simulation task were “create a really hard stretch of track” and “imagine you have to drive over your route. List the strategies that you would use to navigate it.” [...]...|$|E

[...] Martin replied [...] "Atlantic Nashville's protocol {{was to have a}} market research group listen to new recordings and give their opinions on whether it would be a success or not and, sadly, mine came back lukewarm. In order to determine whether to move ahead or heed the market research findings everyone at the label gathered around a conference table to discuss and deliberate. Rick Blackburn, the president, stood at a large tablet, pen in hand and said, [...] "Let's talk about the pros and cons". Starting with the cons the top two strikes against me were #1) I had had a pop hit and #2) I'm a woman... not kidding. The 2 pros were #1) In their opinion I had a good voice and #2) They thought I was nice. Unfortunately, {{the decision was made to}} not release my album, which was sad because I really liked it. After the traumatic end to my affiliation with Atlantic Nashville I desperately needed to stop. It was the first time I felt confused about what I was supposed to be doing.

More than anything else, we think the outpour of attention speaks to the dearth of opportunity to learn from practitioners who, applying the principles of disciplined inquiry, are solving one local problem at a time. Looking to the future, we hope soon to receive contributions from emerging practitioner scholars in Organizational Leadership, those in our program here at Gardner-Webb University and those in similar programs worldwide. Another goal is to issue a call for manuscripts on a theme of interest to organizational and educational leaders.

40|$|Aims/ Intent: Historical French Salons {{aimed to}} provide a venue for {{intellectual}} discourse. Transcending time, present day salons and Socratic Cafés provide a creative outlet for artists, scientists and philosophers to exchange ideas and advance thought and creativity. The salon venue provides a means to both embrace and distance from peer review; at times analytical distance is necessary for advancement of thought and idea (Sawhney, 2013). This forum will briefly discuss the history of salons, their use in present day society, and articulate the potential for advancing ideas in occupational science. The session will end with a brief, one hour salon to explore pre-identified and emerging ideas related to occupational science and potential future directions for the national and global research societies and {{for the advancement of}} the state of the science. Rationale: In an era that has seen a growth in OS research societies around the world, occupational science literature has also expanded to include text books, journals, blogs, and informal means of idea exchange. The salon forum is a unique means to provide reflection (Petty, 2010) and idea exchange beyond the traditional conference format. Outcomes: From this session participants will: 1 - Describe the history and format for salons and their potential to advance occupational science. 2 - Engage in a salon based discussion designed to advance ideas related to national and global efforts to grow and disseminate knowledge of occupational science. 3 - Acquire the skills to utilize a historical methodology with the values of collaboration and critical discourse designed to facilitate sharing and perspective taking to serve humanity. Discussion Questions (*Note, the salon is designed to generate the questions; these are guiding discussion suggestions) 1 - Discuss the state of occupational science and suggestions for future directions for the global societies, discourse, and research. 2 - What recommendations would you have for the future of educational efforts in occupational science? 3 - How do our students best come to know and understand occupational science? 4 - What <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> the state of occupational science and how it needs to be nurtured in its growth to meet the needs of society...|$|E
40|$|Statement of Purpose: Institutionalized {{adults with}} {{intellectual}} disabilities (ID), a disability community {{who has a}} long history of enduring grave injustices and whose voices have been absent in occupational science discourse, continue to face barriers to meaningful participation in occupation (Mahoney, Roberts, Bryze, 2 ̆ 6 Parker Kent, 2016). Additionally, adults with ID are impacted by policies designed with inconsistent and contradictory values influenced by the concurrent adoption of principles from various models of practice and constructions of disability (Channon, 2014); therefore, there is a need to better understand how opportunities for meaningful participation for adults with ID are situated within and influenced by these systems and ruling relations. This paper draws on data from an institutional ethnographic study aimed to make visible the inter-relational ways national, state, and local policies mediate the possibilities for meaningful participation in occupation for adults with ID. Methods: Institutional ethnography (Smith, 2005) was used as the social theory and methodology for this study. The aim of institutional ethnography is to make visible the systems and social relationships through which occupations emerge and are coordinated (Prodinger, Rudman, 2 ̆ 6 Shaw, 2015). Data were collected at a residential facility. Participants included seven adults diagnosed with profound ID and eight adult staff members. Participant observation, ethnographic interviews, and text work were the main sources of data. Narrative analysis was used to systematically relate meanings and interpretations of participants’ experiences to particular narratives on work in an institutional setting. Mapping, as a second analytic process, was used to analyze institutional practices and connect them back to the policies that coordinated work and other activities of the center (Campbell 2 ̆ 6 Gregor, 2004). Results: Analyses revealed the systems and structures through which staff work was coordinated created a systematic regulation of participation in meaningful occupation. More specifically, analyses demonstrated how institutional policies placed greater value on routinization and efficiency over self-determined participation. These findings not only highlight the lack of opportunities for residents and staff to incorporate occupations of their choosing, they call attention to the ways institutional routinization is a perpetuation of the historical notions of what adults with ID should do. Implications for Occupational Science: This study contributes enhanced knowledge about the lived experiences of institutionalized adults with ID and how opportunities to participate in occupations are supported or thwarted by textually-mediated social practices, and challenges the discipline’s theoretical assumptions on participation. Key words: participation, ruling relations, institutional ethnography Discussion Questions: 1. Smith (2005) asserts that social control is increasingly discursive and textual. How might occupational scientists use mapping as a tool to address critical issues of choice and participation? 2. How does Smith’s (2005) construct of “ruling relations” add to our conceptualization of participation? Have occupational scientists given adequate attention to how texts impact participation? 3. This year’s conference theme charges the discipline to navigate the seas of change. I would argue that one way to increase the diversity of occupation (and participation) is to expand the ways we capture experience.

40|$|The {{lifecycle}} {{of academic}} works from idea to investigation – followed by publication, discovery, access, and usage – {{is supported by}} extensive cross-sector collaboration throughout the scholarly communications ecosystem. However, transformational changes occurring worldwide within the knowledge creation and publication landscape have disturbed traditional divisions of labour and established codes of practice. These long-standing conventions and relationships among libraries, publishers, and their respective vendors are now being revisited and renegotiated. With the aim of furthering collaborative cross-sector conversations, SAGE commissioned a study among scholarly communications ‘value chain’ experts. Results were reported in January 2012 as a white paper titled Improving Discoverability of Scholarly Content in the Twentieth Century: Collaboration Opportunities for Librarians, Publishers, and Vendors. Since then, various commissioned studies, research reports, journal articles, international standards, conference papers, and white papers have advanced industry standards and demonstrated collaboration possibilities. Now advancements in ‘intelligent tools’ offer further promise for ‘pushing the boundaries’ of knowledge creation through synergistic relationships that enhance not only discoverability of the scholarly corpus, but also its creation, dissemination, navigation, visibility, and usage. pptx paper sound recording To carry on cross-sector discussions on discoverability, the authors <b>are</b> soliciting <b>your</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> key topics in the SAGE white paper: complete a short survey at HERE to join the conversation...|$|R
