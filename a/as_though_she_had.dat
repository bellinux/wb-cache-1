25|$|During February and March 2017, {{several new}} Passion Pit songs were {{uploaded}} on YouTube on the account The Wishart Group (from {{the name of}} a project started by Michael Angelakos and dedicated to supporting musicians by providing them with legal, educational and healthcare services, with a focus on mental health, a topic on which Angelakos has been especially forthcoming), foreshadowing a fourth album for 2017. Because all the videos for those new songs have the same background photo (a woman wearing a white dress, located {{in the middle of the}} sea, turning around <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> sensed she was being secretly observed from behind), it is suggested that said picture will be the front cover of the fourth album, tentatively titled Tremendous Sea of Love. The songs have since been taken down, but Angelakos announced that he will give a downloadable copy of the album for free to anyone who retweets neuroscientist Michael F. Wells' tweet on the importance of science and research. The profits from the album will be donated to a psychiatric research institution in Cambridge, Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|However, if the tsar’s {{policies}} were too extreme or too disliked, {{he was not}} considered the true tsar. In these cases, {{it was necessary to}} replace this “fake” tsar with the “true” tsar, whoever he may be. Because the serfs had no political power, they rioted to get their message across. But usually, if the serfs did not like the policies of the tsar, they saw the nobles as corrupt and evil, preventing the people of Russia from communicating with the well-intentioned tsar and misinterpreting his decrees. However, they were already suspicious of Catherine upon her accession, because she had annulled an act by Peter III that had essentially freed the serfs belonging to the Orthodox Church. Naturally, the serfs did not like it when Catherine tried to take away their right to petition her because they felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> severed their connection to the autocrat, and their power to appeal to her. Far away from the capital, they were also confused as to the circumstances of her accession to the throne.|$|E

In A narrative of the life of Mrs. Charlotte Charke, they talk to us about her child hood, Charlotte speaks about how she was born when her mother was forty five years of age, and not only was she late coming into the family, but she also felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been unwanted. She was the twelfth and last child born to actor/playwright poet laureate Colley Cibber and the musician/actress Katherine Shore. Most of her many siblings died before their first birthday. According to her autobiography, her brothers and sisters resented her arrival when she was young and many of them maintained their dislike throughout their lives.Charlotte was bold from a young age., family members and close friends of the family say that Charlotte began to show her “addiction” to manly activities at a young age. She was a great shot, she enjoyed, and was good at dressing horses, and at an early age preferred digging in the Gardens dirt. With the absence of her father due to business endeavours and the lack of a mother figure due to constant illnesses, Charlotte became as independent as a young child her age could be, only to put up with nagging maids that watched over her every once and while.|$|E

500|$|The {{apparent}} discrepancies {{contributed to}} {{the view of the}} Polícia Judiciária that there had been no abduction. Even Kate's shout of [...] "they've taken her" [...] was viewed with suspicion, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been paving the way for an abduction story. Particularly from August onwards, these suspicions developed into the theory that Madeleine had died in apartment 5A {{as a result of an}} accident—perhaps after being sedated to help her stay asleep—and that her parents had hidden her body for a month, before retrieving her and driving her to an unknown place in a car they had hired over three weeks after the disappearance. In 2010 Carlos Anjos, former head of the Police Detectives Union in Portugal, told BBC Panorama that most Portuguese investigators still believed Madeleine had died as a result of an accident in the apartment.|$|E

Rihanna [...] "struts her stuff" [...] as she insists that she is a [...] "big shit talker" [...] as she proclaims that [...] "I'll never play a victim/ I'd rather be a stalker". Sean Fennessey for Spin thought that when Rihanna sings the line [...] "Got my middle finger up, I don't give a fuck", it sounded <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never sworn before due to how she preciously mewls the word 'fuck'.|$|E

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 15 May, Galena led her {{squadron}} up to Drewry's Bluff, about [...] from Richmond, where the Confederates had blocked the river and placed a battery on the [...] bluff to cover the obstacles. Galena anchored some [...] from the bluff and opened fire at 07:45, while the wooden ships remained further downriver. Monitor attempted to fire on the battery as well, but her guns could not elevate enough to reach it. Galena engaged the Confederate position for over three hours, until her ammunition was nearly exhausted. Her fire was largely ineffective, although her shells did manage to kill seven and wound eight members of the battery. In return, the ship was hit an estimated 44 times on her port side, of which 13 hits penetrated her armor and she had three large holes punched through her spar deck. She suffered 13 crewmen killed and a further 11 wounded. In {{a letter to his}} wife, Rodgers said that [...] "her sides look <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> an attack of smallpox". Two sailors and one marine aboard Galena were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the battle: Fireman Charles Kenyon, Quartermaster Jeremiah Regan, and [...] Corporal John F. Mackie. Mackie was the first member of the U.S. Marine Corps to receive the medal.|$|E
500|$|Lost {{was planned}} to be a multi-cultural show with an {{international}} cast. The producers thought it was essential that an Australian was cast for the part of Claire, and the Oceanic 815 was leaving from Sydney. Emilie de Ravin was working in Edmonton, so was unable {{to go to the}} auditions, which were being held in Los Angeles. From a video she sent to the producers, they were able to tell that de Ravin had the youth and sweetness required for the role, but also looked <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> some life experience. Sayid was not in the original draft of the pilot episode, but executive consultant Jeff Pinkner had worked with Naveen Andrews on a short-lived ABC series called The Beast, and was keen to have him on Lost. The producers were surprised that Andrews was interested in the role. When they cast him, all Andrews was told was that Sayid was from Iraq and had been in the army. Yunjin Kim originally auditioned for Kate. At her audition she told the producers that she spoke fluent Korean, having been raised in South Korea, where she had starred in several films. The producers were impressed with Kim's performance and wrote her the character of Sun, who was {{planned to be}} someone who could not speak English, but after examining her relationship with her husband, the audience would learn that she does in fact speak it. Daniel Dae Kim was cast in the role of Jin, Sun's husband. Dae Kim described his audition as a [...] "really interesting experience". He found it especially hard as it was his first time acting in Korean, and he had not spoken in it regularly since being in high school, when he would talk to his parents.|$|E

Sir Rudolf Bing, who remembered Callas as being [...] "monstrously fat" [...] in 1951, stated that after the weight loss, Callas was an [...] "astonishing, svelte, striking woman" [...] who [...] "showed none of the signs one usually finds in a fat woman who has lost weight: she looked <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been born to that slender and graceful figure, and had always moved with that elegance." [...] Various rumors spread regarding her weight loss method; one had her swallowing a tapeworm, while Rome's Panatella Mills pasta company claimed she lost weight by eating their [...] "physiologic pasta", prompting Callas to file a lawsuit. Callas stated that she lost the weight by eating a sensible low-calorie diet of mainly salads and chicken.|$|E

2500|$|The she-wolf {{from the}} legend of Romulus and Remus was {{regarded}} as a symbol of Rome from ancient times. Several ancient sources refer to statues depicting the wolf suckling the twins. Livy reports in his Roman history that a statue was erected {{at the foot of the}} Palatine Hill in 295 B.C. [...] Pliny the Elder mentions the presence in the Roman Forum of a statue of a she-wolf that was [...] "a miracle proclaimed in bronze nearby, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> crossed the Comitium while Attus Navius was taking the omens". Cicero also mentions a statue of the she-wolf as one of a number of sacred objects on the Capitoline that had been inauspiciously struck by lightning in the year 65 BC: [...] "it was a gilt statue on the Capitol of a baby being given suck from the udders of a wolf." [...] Cicero also mentions the wolf in De Divinatione 1.20 and 2.47.|$|E
2500|$|Starting {{shortly after}} World War II, a {{controversy}} arose {{over whether the}} 1854 sloop was a new ship or a rebuilt version of the 1797 frigate. Naval architect Howard I. Chapelle {{was one of the}} first people to raise the issue. In his book The History of the American Sailing Navy, published in 1949, he pointed out the differences in the hull dimensions of the 1797 Constellation and the 1854 Constellation as evidence that they were two different ships. He also stated that, [...] "Unfortunately, some of the semi-official lists of American naval ships have listed [...] <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>had,</b> in fact, been preserved and altered. This has led to many believing the sloop-of-war, which is still in existence, to be the oldest ship in the Navy and to have had a continuous identity since 1797...the only reason her register was maintained, by means of an administrative fiction, was to enable the work to be done without the need of applying to Congress for authority and funds to build an entirely new ship." [...] Stephen Bockmiller and Lawrence Bopp agree with Chapelle, writing in USS Constellation: An Illustrated History, that [...] "working under the subterfuge of 'repairs,' the Navy actually began building a new ship about 900 yards from where the original Constellation was being dismantled. Thus, unwittingly, the Navy itself would originate the arguments about the authenticity of the Constellation. To further compound the argument, some salvageable timbers from the original ship, particularly the ship’s knees, were used in constructing the new vessel." ...|$|E
