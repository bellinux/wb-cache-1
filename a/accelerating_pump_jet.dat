40|$|Qualitative {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} use of the NACA injection impeller with the R- 3350 engine increases the inertia of the fuel-injection system and, when the standard fuel-metering system is used, this increase in inertia results in poor engine acceleration characteristics. This investigation was therefore undertaken to determine whether satisfactory acceleration characteristics of the engine equipped with the injection impeller could be obtained by simple modifications to the fuel-monitoring system. The engine was operated with two types of carburetor; namely, a hydraulic-metering carburetor incorporating a vacuum-operated <b>accelerating</b> <b>pump</b> and a direct-metering carburetor having a throttle-actuated <b>accelerating</b> <b>pump.</b> The vacuum-operated <b>accelerating</b> <b>pump</b> of the hydraulic-metering carburetor was modified to produce satisfactory accelerations by supplementing the standard air chamber with an additional 75 -cubic spring.

The results of this investigation indicated that both carburetors can be easily modified to produce satisfactory acceleration characteristics of the engine and no definite choice between the types of carburetor and <b>accelerating</b> <b>pump</b> can be made.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} how an artificial lift method {{in the oil industry}} works,and to compare its performance with other <b>pump</b> systems. <b>Jet</b> <b>pumps</b> are initially used in the oil industry for artificial lift and thus in order to do so one needs a good understanding of themechanics to predict the jet pumps’ performance. The project will begin with a review of how the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> operates, aiming to give the reader an insight and overview into the field of an artificial lift method. Primary literature was gathered by searching the SPE online library whereby the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> has received much attention in the literature. The project will first focus on the theoretical functioning of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> and show how an optimum design can be achieved by changing different parameters. The second section involves case studies where the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> has been used as an artificial lift method. First when it is used in an inaccessible location, offshore and finally lifting heavy oils. In the case studies the design of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> parameters were achieved by searching available literature and the use of in-house software. The use of in-house software and the lack of field data presented made it difficult to compare field results with theoretical performances. In all case studies the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> increased production. * The <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> proved to be very reliable * Low installation and operation costs and * Can be placed in highly deviated wells The above reasons can to some extent justify the low efficiency of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump.</b> The <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performed with efficiencies lower than expected at the different fields. If we assume that the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> design is optimal and the assumptions and theoretical formulas are valid the theoretical and experimental efficiencies should be the same.

Tank AZ- 102 contains 854, 000 gallons (3, 230 m{sup 3 }) of supernatant liquid and 95, 000 gallons (360 m{sup 3 }) of sludge made up of aging waste (or neutralized current acid waste).

40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} model is used to predict the oscillatory flow through tapered cylindrical tube sections (<b>jet</b> <b>pumps).</b> The asymmetric shape of <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> results in a time-averaged pressure drop {{that can be used}} to suppress Gedeon streaming in closed-loop thermoacoustic devices. However, previous work has shown that flow separation in the diverging flow direction counteracts the time-averaged pressure drop. In this work, the characteristics of flow separation in <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> are identified and coupled with the observed <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance. Furthermore, it is shown that the onset of flow separation can be shifted to larger displacement amplitudes by designs that have a smoother transition between the small opening and the tapered surface of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump.</b> These design alterations also reduce the duration of separated flow, resulting in more effective and robust <b>jet</b> <b>pumps.</b> To make the proposed <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> designs more compact without reducing their performance, the minimum big opening radius that can be implemented before the local minor losses have an influence on the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance is investigated.

Most experimental studies on water <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> mainly carried out to assess the maximum efficiency.

However, suction lift is inversely proportional to flow rate.

40|$|The {{oscillatory flow}} through tapered {{cylindrical}} tube sections (<b>jet</b> <b>pumps)</b> {{is characterized by}} a numerical parameter study. The shape of a <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> results in asymmetric hydrodynamic end effects which cause a time-averaged pressure drop to occur under oscillatory flow conditions. Hence, <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> are used as streaming suppressors in closed-loop thermoacoustic devices. A two-dimensional axisymmetric computational fluid dynamics model is used to calculate the performance {{of a large number of}} conical <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> geometries in terms of time-averaged pressure drop and acoustic power dissipation.

40|$|Bigger {{ships are}} {{replacing}} the small ships, {{also at the}} Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal. A direct consequence {{is the use of}} larger main propellers and increased installed engine power in order to realize acceptable ship speeds. To improve the maneuverability, the power of auxiliary bow and stern propulsion systems has increased as well. This results in higher flow velocities and thus more damage to bed protections at berthing places. Especially <b>pump</b> <b>jet</b> thrusters as a bow propulsion system may attack the bed protections more severely due to a vertical component of the flow field induced by the <b>pump</b> <b>jet</b> which is directed towards the bed. The aim of this research is, in cooperation with Rijkswaterstaat, to develop an analytical model for the flow field induced by the <b>pump</b> <b>jet</b> thruster. Subsequently, the required dimensions of a bed protection has been determined as well as an investigation on the possible scour effects in case of an unprotected bed of the Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal. In order to meet this goal, an inventory of the bow propulsion systems in inland vessels has been made by conducting an inquiry. Subsequently, the different propulsion systems have been compared qualitatively. Since existing formulas are based on the circular free jet, this system is also treated in the comparison. In addition, a water jet (hydro jets can be distinguished in low-powered and high-powered jets), often used as propulsion system by ferries, has been taken into account due to the strong analogy with the circular free jet. As a result, both the ratio of decrease of axial velocities and diffusion of the jets in radial direction of a circular free jet strongly correspond to a high-powered water jet. However, the free propeller and transverse tunnel thrusters are considered to have a faster decrease of axial velocities and a faster diffusion of the flow field. The applied power and the induced turbulence seem to be the main reasons for the flow field characteristics. An essential part of this research is the derivation of an analytical model for the <b>pump</b> <b>jet</b> thruster induced flow field. The principle is based on the free propeller theory. In the case of a <b>pump</b> <b>jet,</b> part of the contraction takes place inside the unit. Furthermore, the flow field has been subdivided in three parts: initial outflow velocity, axial flow velocity and the flow velocity distribution in the region of the established flow. The coefficients in the model have been empirically determined using a simulation with a CFD model. This model has been compared to flow fields induced by different other propulsion systems. It results in a similar axial flow velocity decrease as a low-powered water <b>jet.</b> However, the <b>pump</b> <b>jet</b> diverges faster and with a greater angle than any other jet. The derived model has been used to investigate the stone stability at the toe of a sheet pile wall. Firstly, the flow velocities at the bed have been evaluated by looking at berthed ships in different conditions (fully loaded, partly loaded and unloaded). Secondly, a stability analysis of the bed material has been executed by using a method presented by Deltares. However, {{in order to protect the}} bed against the high flow velocities, large stone diameters are required. An alternative is allowing scour holes to occur, but the length of the sheet piling should be extended in order to maintain stability of the entire quay wall. The predicted maximum scour depths caused by a <b>pump</b> <b>jet</b> are in the same range of measured scour depths at the Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal. This means that scour holes may cause instability problems of the existing sheet pile walls. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
