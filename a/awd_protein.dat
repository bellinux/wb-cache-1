Null mutations of theawdgene cause lethality after puparium formation. Larvae homozygous for such mutations have small imaginal discs, lymph glands, and brain lobes. Neither the imaginal discs nor the ovaries from such null mutant larvae are capable of further growth or normal differentiation when transplanted into suitable host larvae. This null mutant phenotype can be entirely rescued by one copy of a transgene that has 750 bp ofawdupstream regulatory DNA fused to a full-lengthawdcDNA. Tissue-specific expression of <b>AWD</b> <b>protein</b> from this rescue transgene is identical to tissue-specific expression of β-galactosidase from a reporter transgene that has the same regulatory region fused to the bacteriallac Zgene. However, this rescue transgene or reporter transgene expression pattern is only {{a subset of the}} endogenous pattern of expression detected by eitherin situhybridization or immunohistochemistry. This suggests thatawdis normally expressed in some tissues where it is not required. The null mutant phenotype cannot be rescued at all by a transgene that has 750 bp ofawdupstream regulatory DNA fused to a full-lengthawdcDNA with a mutation that eliminates NDP kinase activity by replacement of the active site histidine with alanine. This suggests that the enzymatic activity of the <b>AWD</b> <b>protein</b> is necessary for its biological function. The human genesnm 23 -H 1 andnm 23 -H 2 encode NDP kinase A and B subunits, respectively. The protein subunit encoded by either humannm 23 gene is 78 % identical to that encoded by theDrosophila awdgene. Transgenes that have the 750 -bpawdupstream regulatory DNA fused to humannm 23 -H 2 cDNA but not tonm 23 -H 1 cDNA can rescue the imaginal disc phenotype and the zygotic lethality caused by homozygosis for anawdnull mutation as efficiently as anawdtransgene. However, rescue of female sterility requires twice as muchnm 23 -H 2 expression asawdexpression. This implies that the enzymatic activity of the <b>AWD</b> <b>protein</b> is not sufficient for its biological function. The biological function may require nonconserved residues of the <b>AWD</b> <b>protein</b> that allow it to interact with other proteins...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} {{levels of}} the metastasis suppressor gene Nm 23 {{have been shown to}} correlate positively or inversely with prognosis in different cancer cohorts. This indicates that Nm 23 may be needed at different expression levels and may function differently in various tissues. Here we report a novel epithelial function of the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of human Nm 23, abnormal wing discs (awd). We show a dynamic expression pattern of the <b>Awd</b> <b>protein</b> during morphogenesis of the Drosophila follicle cells during oogenesis. Loss-of-function awd mutant cells result in the accumulation and spreading of adherens junction components, such as Drosophila E-cadherin, β-catenin/Armadillo, and α-spectrin, and the disruption of epithelial integrity, including breaking up of the epithelial sheet and piling up of follicle cells. In contrast, overexpression of awd diminishes adherens junction components and induces a mesenchymal-cell-like cell shape change. The gain-of-function phenotype is consistent with a potential oncogenic function of this metastasis suppressor gene. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the epithelial function of awd is mediated by Rab 5 and show that the Rab 5 expression level is downregulated in awd mutant cells. Therefore, awd modulates the level and localization of adherens junction components via endocytosis. This is the first demonstration of an in vivo function of Nm 23 family genes in regulating epithelial morphogenesis...|$|E
40|$|We have {{isolated}} a {{human and}} murine homologue of the Drosophila prune gene through dbEST searches. The gene is ubiquitously expressed in human adult tissues, while in mouse developing embryos {{a high level}} of expression is con®ned to the nervous system particularly in the dorsal root ganglia, cranial nerves, and neural retina. The gene is composed of eight exons and is located in the 1 q 21. 3 chromosomal region. A pseudogene has been sequenced and mapped to chromosomal region 13 q 12. PRUNE protein retains the four characteristic domains of DHH phosphoesterases. The synergism between prune and awd K-pn in Drosophila has led various authors to propose an interaction between these genes. However, such an interaction has never been supported by biochemical data. By using interaction-mating and in vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we show for the ®rst time the ability of human PRUNE to interact with the human homologue of <b>awd</b> <b>protein</b> (nm 23 -H 1). In contrast, PRUNE is impaired in its interaction with nm- 23 -H 1 -S 120 G mutant, a gain-of-function mutation associated with advanced neuroblastoma stages. Consistently, PRUNE and nm 23 -H 1 proteins partially colocalize in the cytoplasm. The data presented are consistent with the view that PRUNE acts as a negative regulator of the nm 23 -H 1 protein. We discuss how PRUNE regulates nm 23 -H 1 protein and postulate possible implications of PRUNE in neuroblastoma progression...|$|E
40|$|In eukaryotes, {{initiation}} of DNA replication requires {{the assembly of}} a multiprotein prereplicative complex (pre-RC) at the ori-gins. We recently reported that <b>aWD</b> repeat-containing <b>protein,</b> origin recognition complex (ORC) -associated (ORCA/LRWD 1), {{plays a crucial role}} in stabilizing ORC to chromatin. Here, we find that ORCA is required for the G 1 -to-S-phase transition in hu-man cells. In addition to binding to ORC, ORCA associates with Cdt 1 and its inhibitor, geminin. Single-molecule pulldown ex-periments demonstrate that each molecule of ORCA can bind to one molecule of ORC, one molecule of Cdt 1, and twomolecules of geminin. Further, ORCA directly interacts with the N terminus of Orc 2, and the stability of ORCA is dependent on its associa-tion with Orc 2. ORCA associates with Orc 2 throughout the cell cycle, with Cdt 1 during mitosis and G 1, and with geminin in post-G 1 cells. Overexpression of geminin results in the loss of interaction between ORCA and Cdt 1, suggesting that increased levels of geminin in post-G 1 cells titrate Cdt 1 away fromORCA. We propose that the dynamic association of ORCAwith pre-RC components modulates the assembly of its interacting partners on chromatin and facilitates DNA replication initiation. In eukaryotes, {{initiation of}} DNA replication requires the assem-bly of a prereplicative complex (pre-RC) in late mitosis and G 1, with the sequential loading of the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc 6, Cdt 1, and MCM 2 - 7 onto replication origins (6). The Cdt 1 -mediated recruitment of the helicase MCM 2 - 7 to chro-matin also requires MCM 9 (31). At the G 1 -S transition, pre-RC i...|$|R
