5|$|After Cimon's ostracism, Pericles {{continued}} {{to promote a}} populist social policy. He first proposed a decree that permitted the poor to watch theatrical plays without paying, with the state covering {{the cost of their}} admission. With other decrees he lowered the property requirement for the archonship in 458–457 BC and bestowed generous wages on all citizens who served as jurymen in the Heliaia (the supreme court of Athens) some time just after 454BC. His most controversial measure, however, was <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> 451 BC limiting Athenian citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. <b>A</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E

5|$|In some states, {{there are}} Son of Sam laws prohibiting convicted criminals from {{publishing}} memoirs for profit. These laws were {{a response to}} offers to David Berkowitz to write memoirs about the murders he committed. The Supreme Court struck down <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> this type in New York {{as a violation of}} the First Amendment in the case Simon & Schuster v. Crime Victims Board (1991). That statute did not prohibit publication of a memoir by a convicted criminal. Instead, it provided that all profits from the book were to be put in escrow for a time. The interest from the escrow account was used to fund the New York State Crime Victims Board – an organization that pays the medical and related bills of victims of crime. Similar laws in other states remain unchallenged.|$|E
5|$|Once a recruit was {{accepted}} he was 'marked' on the arm, presumably a tattoo or brand, to facilitate recognition if {{he attempted to}} desert. The recruit was then issued with an identification disk (which was worn around the neck) and a certificate of enlistment (probatoria). He was then assigned to a unit. <b>A</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> 375 required those with superior fitness to be assigned to the comitatenses. In the 4th century, the minimum length of service was 20 years (24 years in some limitanei units). This compares with 25 years in both legions and auxilia during the Principate.|$|E

5|$|The Committee {{hoped to}} avoid the Germans {{becoming}} involved in the day-to-day administration of the territory as they had during World War I, while also allowing Belgium to maintain a degree of national autonomy and independence.

5|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} the financial Panic of 1819 left many Kentuckians in debt and unable to meet their financial obligations. A debt relief movement began in the state, and pro-relief candidates won majorities in the General Assembly in 1820. The Assembly passed <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> replevin that was extremely favorable to debtors. Disgruntled creditors challenged {{the constitutionality of the}} law, appealing their case to the Court of Appeals. The court opined in favor of the creditors. Attempts to remove the anti-relief justices failed. The pro-relief legislature passed a measure abolishing the Court of Appeals and replacing it with a new court, to which pro-relief governor Joseph Desha appointed pro-relief justices who upheld the replevin law.|$|E
5|$|The most {{politically}} charged issue in Kentucky during Breckinridge's campaign, however, was the Old Court-New Court controversy. The Panic of 1819 had left many Kentuckians in dire financial straits. Legislators sought to relieve {{some of the}} financial burden by passing <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> replevin which favored debtors. The Kentucky Court of Appeals, (the highest court in the Commonwealth at the time,) declared the law unconstitutional. The next year, an incensed General Assembly passed legislation that dissolved the court {{and replaced it with}} a new court. Neither court acknowledged the other as valid, and a confused public lost respect for public authority in general. The issue was generally split along party lines, with Democrats generally favoring the New Court and Whigs favoring the Old Court.|$|E

5|$|While the {{government}} brought in foreign experts (yatoi) during {{the building of}} the country's modern infrastructure, the high seismicity in Japan proved to be an ideal laboratory setting during the establishment of the new science of seismology. In 1876, John Milne came from England to teach at the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo. Following the earthquake of February 22, 1880, Milne's attention turned to seismology as a primary area of study. That earthquake also triggered the formation of the Seismological Society of Japan, which was an organization to help foreign scientists stay coordinated in their efforts. Shortly thereafter, the Japanese had their own organization (the Japan Meteorological Agency) that had taken control of an earthquake reporting system that was initially created by Milne. Ultimately, the system and the 1891 earthquake provided data by which seismologist Fusakichi Omori developed <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> decay for aftershocks.|$|E
5|$|Early modern Scotland was a {{theoretically}} patriarchal society, {{in which}} men had total authority over women, but how this worked is practice is difficult to discern. Marriages, particularly higher in society, were often political in nature {{and the subject of}} complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating and finding marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s, or as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners. Before the Reformation, the extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient. At the beginning of the period, women had a very limited legal status. The criminal courts refused to recognise them as witnesses or independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. In the post-Reformation period there was a criminalisation of women, partly evident in witchcraft prosecutions from 1563. Through the 1640s, independent commissions were set up to try women for child murder, and after pressure from the kirk <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> 1690 placed the presumption of guilt on a woman if she concealed a pregnancy and birth, and her child later died.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> 9 June 1975 {{increased}} the number of eligible occupational diseases and extended the duration of benefits. <b>A</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> 3 June 1975 introduced various benefit improvements for pensioners. The multiplying coefficient was raised to 2% and applied to average earnings of the best 3 years in the last 10 years of work, and automatic annual adjustment of minimum pensions to increase of the minimum contractual wage in the industrial sector (with a smaller adjustment made for pensions higher than the minima). <b>A</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> 27 December 1975 introduced ad hoc upgrading of cash benefits for certain diseases and of all flat-rate allowances. <b>A</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> 14 July 1967 extended family allowances to self-employed farmers, sharecroppers, and tenant farmers.

25|$|A {{wide range}} of social reforms were carried out during Moro's periods as prime minister. The 1967 Ponte Law (Legge Ponte) {{introduced}} urgent housing provisions {{as part of an}} envisioned reform of the entire sector, such as the introduction of minimum standards for housing and environment. A law promulgated on 14 December 1963 introduced an annual allowance for university students with income below a given level. Another law, promulgated on 10 March 1968, introduced voluntary public pre-elementary education for children aged three to five years. A law promulgated on 21 July 1965 introduced new pension provisions under the general scheme. The legal minima was raised, all current pensions were revalued, seniority pensions (pensioni d’anzianità) were introduced (after 35 years of contributions workers could retire even before attaining pensionable age), and within the national social security institution (Istituto nazionale della previdenza sociale), a Social Fund (Fondo Sociale) was established, ensuring to all members pensioners a basic uniform pension largely financed by state, known as the social pension (not related to the later social pension introduced in 1968). <b>A</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> 22 July 1966 extended pension insurance to small traders. <b>A</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> 22 July 1966 extended health insurance to retired traders, and <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> 29 May 1967 extended compulsory health insurance to retired farmers, tenant farmers, and sharecroppers, and extended health insurance to the unemployed in receipt of unemployment benefits. <b>A</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> 18 March 1968 introduced the principle of earnings-related pensions within the general scheme, with the pension formula to equal 1.626% of average earnings in the last 3 years of work multiplied by the number of contribution years (maximum pension: 65% of previous earnings) up to 40. <b>A</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> 5 November 1968 extended family allowances to the unemployed in receipt of unemployment benefits.|$|E
