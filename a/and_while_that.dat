5|$|In {{identifying}} the remains {{as those of}} Palaeoscincus, Broom initially classified Paranthodon as an ankylosaurian, a statement backed {{by the research of}} Coombs in the 1970s. However, in 1929, Nopcsa identified the taxon as a stegosaurid, with which most modern studies agree. In 1981, the genus was reviewed with modern taxonomy, and found to be a valid genus of stegosaurid. However, a more recent 2008 review of Stegosauria could only identify one distinguishing feature, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>that</b> study still referred it to Stegosauridae based on similarity, no diagnostic features of the family could be identified in Paranthodon.|$|E

However, during this period gas executive J. Edward Addicks, a Philadelphia millionaire, established residence in Delaware, and began pouring money into the Republican Party, especially in Kent and Sussex County. He expected this investment to earn him a seat in the U.S. Senate, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>that</b> never happened, he did succeed in reigniting the Republican Party, which would soon become the dominant party in the state. Marvil's election was accompanied by the election of a Republican State House, and the convening of a state constitutional convention that would soon produce a new constitution.|$|E

500|$|James Schellenberg {{writing in}} Challenging Destiny, a Canadian science fiction and fantasy magazine, was {{impressed}} by Shikasta [...] "grand sense of perspective" [...] and the context of humanity set in a [...] "vaster scale of civilization and right-thinking". He liked the concept of SOWF as a [...] "metaphor of community connectedness", but felt it was an unusual way to build a utopia. The book's fractured storytelling leads to Lessing breaking the [...] "famous dictum of writing – show, don't tell", <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>that</b> may work in certain circumstances, Schellenberg felt that that approach does not work very well in Shikasta. The online magazine Journey to the Sea found Lessing's inclusion of stories from the Hebrew Bible [...] "entertaining and intriguing", and said she challenges the logical thinker's rejection of these sacred texts, suggesting that it is [...] "imaginatively possible" [...] {{that they could be}} true.|$|E
500|$|While reviewers were troubled with categorizing the band, {{much time}} was spent deliberating upon the album's sound when held in {{comparison}} with other Isis material. Robin Jahdi, writing for FACT Magazine, holds that the album presents a shift in dynamic. [...] "It {{takes a while to}} realise, but [...] is pretty different to what's come before from Aaron Turner and co. The last time this happened was 2002, when they transformed from brutal sludge metal to something altogether more delicate." [...] Here, he references the transition brokered when Isis released Oceanic, a critically acclaimed departure from the sound of 2000's Celestial. Other differences from some of Isis' previous material have been noted; on a broad scale, the album was deemed [...] "less punishing than Panopticon, from 2004, and less ponderous than In the Absence of Truth, from 2006", but closer examination also led Slants Matthew Cole to suggest differences. [...] "On past releases, Isis employed loud/soft dynamics to stunning effect, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>that</b> element remains central to their sound, the best parts of Wavering Radiant suggest a more sophisticated integration. Rather than playing on the line between pretty and heavy, tracks like 'Stone to Wake a Serpent' and '20 Minutes / 40 Years' dissolve it." [...] Not all reviews held the album to be such a departure – for instance, Andrew Hartwig feels that [...] "Wavering Radiant continues in the direction that Isis have been travelling since their inception, with an increasing prominence of melody and a greater focus on placid sections to balance out their signature crushing heaviness".|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Broward County {{contacted}} the United States Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs about their Innovative Readiness Training (IRT) program, which looks for civil-military projects that improve military readiness {{and address the}} needs of the American public. [...] CWO Donovan Motley said that the cleanup of Osborne Reef easily met those requirements: [...] "This project allows these military divers and Army LCU crew members' real-world training in 'wartime' salvage ops. [...] And perhaps, more importantly, it exercises interoperability with federal, state and county agencies and these skill sets could have the most significance {{in the aftermath of a}} Katrina-type natural disaster." [...] Beginning in June 2007, the United States military and Coast Guard began “DiveExEast 07" [...] to ascertain the best and most efficient processes for the cleanup effort. [...] Barring unforeseen operational commitments and engagements, military divers hope to use this project as a training platform for several years and [...] "recover the maximum number of tires possible from day one." [...] Coastal America, an office of the United States federal government was tasked with coordinating the cleanup of the reef; they were instrumental in finalizing the deal wherein the Florida government would allocate $2 million to cover transport and recycling of the tires. [...] Ken Banks with the Florida DEP estimated the project to take three to five years, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>that</b> timeline won't allow for the removal of all two million tires, it should mitigate the majority of the damage they're causing to the corals and coastline, though Banks predicted it could take decades for the reefs to rebuild.|$|E
500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>that</b> was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E

2500|$|The {{district}} court ruled in Schempp's favor, and {{struck down the}} Pennsylvania statute.

This change did not satisfy Schempp, however, and he continued his action against the school district, charging that the amendment of the law did not change its nature as an unconstitutional establishment of religion. Because {{of the change in}} the law, the Supreme Court had responded to the school district's appeal by vacating the first ruling and remanding the case to the {{district court}}. [...] The district court again found for Schempp. The school district appealed to the Supreme Court again, and, on appeal, the case was consolidated with a similar Maryland case launched by Madalyn Murray.|$|E
2500|$|When McKenzie {{arrived at}} Fisk in 1915, {{nearly half the}} student body was {{enrolled}} in pre-college courses, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>that</b> population decreased throughout his tenure, Fisk still taught high school classes well into the 1920s.

Blacks from racially progressive cities in the North lived with counterparts from staunchly racist communities in the South, where racial violence was a constant threat.

[...] Students arriving at Fisk were [...] "sifted" [...] based on their scholastic aptitude, and placed in classes commensurate with their ability. At the end of each quarter they were reclassified based on their performance. By minimizing the bi-modal distribution of academic ability within classes, course instructors could more effectively target the learning needs of students and help ensure that Fisk graduates could [...] "compete on an even basis in the most rigid colleges of the land." ...|$|E
