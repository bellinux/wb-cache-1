5|$|<b>Andrew</b> <b>was</b> made canon in the Chapter of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Warmia on 16 September 1581. The canons and {{the elderly}} bishop, Marcin Kromer, had been opposed to Andrew's appointment, but the new papal nuncio, Alberto Bolognetti, the {{chancellor}} of Poland, Jan Zamoyski, and Stephen Báthory persuaded one of the canons to abdicate in favor of Andrew. However, the canons, along with the Estates of Royal Prussia, prevented Andrew's promotion to coadjutor bishop {{saying that he was}} too young. At the nuncio's initiative, <b>Andrew</b> <b>was</b> elected provost of the Monastery of Miechów in spring 1583.|$|E
5|$|<b>Andrew</b> <b>was</b> {{the second}} son of King Béla III and Béla's first wife, Agnes of Antioch. The year of Andrew's birth is not known, but modern historians agree {{that he was}} born around 1177. <b>Andrew</b> <b>was</b> first {{mentioned}} in connection to his father's invasion of the Principality of Halych in 1188. That year, Béla III invaded Halych upon the request of its former prince, Vladimir II Yaroslavich, who had been expelled by his subjects. Béla forced the new prince, Roman Mstislavich, to flee. After conquering Halych, he granted it to Andrew. Béla also captured Vladimir Yaroslavich and imprisoned him in Hungary.|$|E

5|$|<b>Andrew</b> <b>was</b> the {{youngest}} of the four sons of András Báthory and Margit Majláth. His father was the marshal of the court of Isabella Jagiellon and her son, John Sigismund Zápolya. Isabella and John Sigismund ruled the eastern territories of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary as vassals of the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. The date of Andrew's birth is uncertain, because his actual age was kept secret in the early 1580s to promote his career in the Roman Catholic Church. He was most probably born in late 1562 or early 1563, according to historian Ildikó Horn. His father died around that time, implying that <b>Andrew</b> <b>was</b> a posthumous son.|$|E

5|$|Though <b>Andrew</b> <b>was</b> a small {{tropical}} cyclone {{for most of}} its lifespan, it caused extreme damage, especially in the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana. The vast majority of the damage was as a result of extremely high winds, although a few tornadoes spawned by Andrew caused considerable damage in Louisiana. Throughout the areas affected, almost 177,000people were left homeless. Outside of the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana, effects were widespread, although damage was minimal. Overall, $26.5billion in losses and 65fatalities were attributed to Andrew, with some estimates ranging as high as $34billion. <b>Andrew</b> <b>was</b> the costliest hurricane in U.S. history at the time, but is now fifth following hurricanes Katrina (2005), Sandy (2012), Harvey (2017), and Ike (2008).|$|E

5|$|Andrew {{returned}} to Hungary {{at the beginning}} of 1290.

Before <b>Andrew</b> <b>was</b> successful, Arnold Hahót, an enemy of the Kőszegis, invited him to the fort of Štrigova and captured him.

5|$|Before the First World War, most of Europe {{was ruled}} by monarchs related to George, but {{during and after}} the war, the monarchies of Austria, Germany, Greece, and Spain, like Russia, fell to {{revolution}} and war. In March 1919, Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Lisle Strutt was dispatched on the personal authority of the King to escort the former Emperor Charles I of Austria and his family to safety in Switzerland. In 1922, a Royal Navy ship was sent to Greece to rescue his cousins, Prince and Princess Andrew. Prince <b>Andrew</b> <b>was</b> a nephew of Queen Alexandra through her brother King George I of Greece, and Princess <b>Andrew</b> <b>was</b> a daughter of Prince Louis of Battenberg, one of the German princes granted a British peerage in 1917. Their children included Prince Philip, who would later marry George's granddaughter, Elizabeth II. The Greek monarchy was restored again shortly before George's death.|$|E
5|$|Following a coup by disgruntled {{military}} officers, Constantine I abdicated for {{a second}} time on 27 September 1922. With several other members of his family, including Queen Olga, he went into exile in Italy and his eldest son succeeded him for a few months on the throne as George II. Within months, Constantine died in Italy. One of Olga's sons, Prince <b>Andrew,</b> <b>was</b> among those arrested by the new regime. Many defendants in the treason trials that followed the coup were shot, including senior politicians and generals. Foreign diplomats assumed that <b>Andrew</b> <b>was</b> also in mortal danger, and George V of the United Kingdom, Alfonso XIII of Spain, the French president Raymond Poincaré and Pope Pius XI sent representatives to Athens to intercede on his behalf. Andrew, though spared, was banished for life and his family (including the infant Prince Philip, later Duke of Edinburgh and consort of Queen Elizabeth II) fled into exile in December 1922 aboard a British cruiser, HMS Calypso.|$|E

5|$|<b>Andrew</b> <b>was</b> the {{favorite}} nephew of Stephen Báthory who officially adopted him. Giovanni Andrea Caligari, the papal nuncio (or ambassador) in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, urged the king to persuade Andrew {{to start a}} church career. According to the Transylvanian historian, István Szamosközy, Andrew had already been fascinated by altars, churches and tombs as a child. However, his Protestant mother and relatives wanted to dissuade Andrew. After recovering from an almost lethal pneumonia in spring 1581, Andrew accepted their advice. He was especially worried about clerical celibacy, because it prevented him from fathering legitimate children. He also hoped that his uncle would promote his secular career. His Jesuit tutors finally persuaded him to accept his uncle's decision.|$|E
5|$|<b>Andrew</b> <b>was</b> {{the son of}} Stephen the Posthumous, the self-styled Duke of Slavonia, and {{his second}} wife, Tomasina Morosini.
