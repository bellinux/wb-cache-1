About 150,000 conscripted workers, serving in consecutive periods of thirty days each over {{a total of five}} years, worked on the massive defensive walls of Chang'an, which were completed in 190 BC. Conscript laborers were commissioned to build and maintain shrines dedicated to various deities and the spirits of the emperor's ancestors. Conscripts also maintained canal systems used for agricultural transport <b>and</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Some of the larger Han canal renovation projects included repairs to the Dujiangyan Irrigation System and Zhengguo Canal, built by the previous State of Qin and Qin dynasty (221â€“206 BC), respectively.|$|E
40|$|Koshihikari and Hinohikari sown {{at three}} {{different}} times were grown under running <b>and</b> stagnant <b>irrigation</b> <b>and</b> in two water depth systems. The {{number of days}} required for transplanting to heading (DTH) was shortened as the date of sowing was put back. Rises in water temperature during the daytime were strictly checked under running <b>irrigation</b> <b>and</b> at 22 cm depth, though the water temperature during nights was not different from surface to 22 cm depth. Running irrigation extends DTH, while stagnant irrigation remarkably reduced DTH under high temperatures. A high water temperature induced by stagnant <b>irrigation</b> <b>and</b> deep flood <b>irrigation</b> accelerated elongation growth, and low temperature due to running irrigation reduced the rate of leaf emergence and final leaf number on the main stem. The effects of running <b>and</b> stagnant <b>irrigation</b> on dry matter production depended on the temperature environment during growing period, <b>and</b> running <b>irrigation</b> under high temperature <b>and</b> stagnant <b>irrigation</b> under low temperature acted positively on dry matter production.

5|$|Irrigation systems: In {{the modern}} Sichuan region {{belonging}} to the State of Qin of ancient China, the Dujiangyan Irrigation System devised by the Qin Chinese hydrologist <b>and</b> <b>irrigation</b> engineer Li Bing was built in 256 BCE to irrigate a vast area of farmland that today still supplies water. By the 2nd century AD, during the Han Dynasty, the Chinese also used chain pumps that lifted water from a lower elevation to higher one. These were powered by manual foot pedal, hydraulic waterwheels, or rotating mechanical wheels pulled by oxen. The water was used for public works of providing water for urban residential quarters and palace gardens, but mostly for irrigation of farmland canals and channels in the fields.|$|E

5|$|Over half of {{all known}} flatworm species are parasitic, and some do {{enormous}} harm to humans and their livestock. Schistosomiasis, caused by one genus of trematodes, is the second-most devastating of all human diseases caused by parasites, surpassed only by malaria. Neurocysticercosis, which arises when larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium penetrate the central nervous system, is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. The threat of platyhelminth parasites to humans in developed countries is rising because of the popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods, and imports of food from high-risk areas. In less developed countries, people often cannot afford the fuel required to cook food thoroughly, and poorly designed water-supply <b>and</b> <b>irrigation</b> projects increase the dangers presented by poor sanitation and unhygienic farming.|$|E
5|$|Research {{indicates}} that the salinity of the Euphrates water in Iraq has increased considerably since the nearly simultaneous construction of the Keban Dam in Turkey and the Tabqa Dam in Syria. This increase can, among other things, {{be related to the}} lower discharge of the Euphrates {{as a result of the}} construction of the Keban Dam and the dams of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) in Turkey, and to a lesser degree of the Tabqa Dam in Syria. High-salinity water is less useful for domestic <b>and</b> <b>irrigation</b> purposes.|$|E

5|$|An {{independent}} study revealed {{the water to}} be radioactive and potentially dangerous to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy. Jordan's Ministry of Water <b>and</b> <b>Irrigation</b> has stated that the radioactivity {{is not a problem}} because the water is to be diluted with an equal amount of water from other sources, although it remains disputed if this would be enough to bring the water up to standards. The Ministry said the {{independent study}} was inaccurate, as it did not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project. The President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in the water in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when the water is exposed to air on the surface.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the force}} {{was called in}} to manage {{industrial}} disputes on a range of occasions between 1887 and 1906. In the mining town of Lethbridge, for example, the Alberta Railway and Coal Company locked out its workforce in 1894 during an attempt to cut staff and reduce wages; a team of ten police was deployed to maintain order, in particular any risks posed by eastern European immigrants, and to mediate in the dispute. Police deployed there again in 1906 for nine months during a dispute between the company, now called the Alberta Railway <b>and</b> <b>Irrigation</b> Company, and the workforce over union recognition, pay and working conditions. A team of 82 regular police were reinforced by 11 special constables recruited from within the company, with an undercover constable deployed to infiltrate the strike and send back intelligence. Efforts were made to collect information on the earnings of the union leaders, probably intended for use in discrediting them. The police maintained order and escorted non-striking workers past the picket lines.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{answer to}} these {{problems}} was to issue two decrees, one in 1977 and one in 1981, which called {{for an increase in}} the maximum size of privately owned plots within the Soviet Union to half a hectare. These measures removed important obstacles for the expansion of agricultural output, but did not solve the problem. Under Brezhnev, private plots yielded 30% of the national agricultural production when they only cultivated 4% of the land. This was seen by some as proof that de-collectivisation was necessary to prevent Soviet agriculture from collapsing, but leading Soviet politicians shrank from supporting such drastic measures due to ideological and political interests. The underlying problems were the growing shortage of skilled workers, a wrecked rural culture, the payment of workers in proportion to the quantity rather than the quality of their work, and too large farm machinery for the small collective farms and the roadless countryside. In the face of this, Brezhnev's only options were schemes such as large land reclamation <b>and</b> <b>irrigation</b> projects, or of course, radical reform.|$|E

He defeated 32 rulers in different parts of the country before he killed Elara, the South Indian ruler who was occupying Anuradhapura, and ascended to the throne. The chronicle Mahavamsa describes his reign with much praise, and devotes 11 chapters out of 37 for his reign. He is described as both a warrior king and a devout Buddhist. After unifying the country, he helped establish Buddhism on a firm and secure base, and built several monasteries and shrines including the Ruwanweli Seya and Lovamahapaya.|$|E

In 1987, the New Theater Building of the Portland Center for the Performing Arts was completed immediately next door to the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall.
