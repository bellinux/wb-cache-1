5|$|After {{recovering}} from his hip surgery, Costello returned to active competition at age 56. The {{fact that he}} was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recover</b> from such a major injury is credited to his almost-fanatical style of healthy living. As a devout vegan, Costello credited his meat-free diet with his recovery, as well as the remarkable shape he was in for a man of his age.|$|E

5|$|It {{was only}} after Svyatoslav's death in late 1076 that Izyaslav was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recover</b> the status of Grand Prince. Vsevolod, who had {{previously}} fought against him, was appointed Prince of Chernigov and thus heir to the Kievan throne, explaining perhaps Vsevolod's lack of opposition. The Poles were persuaded by the papacy to give Izyaslav assistance recovering his kingdom, and on July 15, 1077, Izyaslav re-entered Kiev.|$|E
5|$|Munro issued three edicts {{regarding}} Christian estates {{that had}} {{been taken over by}} non-Christians during the captivity. In determining ownership of land, he sent two Mangalorean Hindus, Muthsuddy Vencappah and Saly Purvoe Dur Shetty along with other Christians to investigate and report back to him about these estates. Through the assistance of the Church, and with the support of Munro, the Christians were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recover</b> their lands and estates.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines {{wasted no}} time {{exploiting}} the situation and signed a peace treaty with their Christian neighbours and with one of Bayezid's sons.

5|$|While one Persian force, under Shahrbaraz, {{was able}} to secure control of Amida, Domentziolus {{concentrated}} his efforts on a second one under Shahin Vahmanzadegan.

In 608, Shahrbaraz and Shahin continued their respective efforts to conquer Mesopotamia and Armenia.|$|E
5|$|A major {{complication}} in remastering {{the original}} work was having {{many of the}} critical game files go missing or on archaic formats. A large number of backup files were made on Digital Linear Tape (DLT) which Disney/LucasArts had been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recover</b> for Double Fine, but the company had no drives to read the tapes. Former LucasArts sound engineer Jory Prum had managed to save a DLT drive {{and was able to}} extract all of the game's audio development data from the tapes.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{have not}} been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recover</b> enough of Kronans sculptures for a {{detailed}} reconstruction of the ornamentation. The mascarons (architectural facemasks) and putti (images of children) that were salvaged as of 2007 show considerable artistic quality according to Soop. A large sculpture of a warrior figure was found in 1987 and {{is an example of}} high-quality workmanship, possibly even a symbolic portrait of King Charles. Since nothing is known of the surrounding ornamentation and sculptures, the conclusion remains speculative.|$|E

5|$|Bonaparte {{restored}} Lafayette's citizenship on 1 March 1800, {{and he was}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recover</b> some of his properties. The ruler {{offered to}} make Lafayette minister to the United States, but was met with a firm refusal, as Lafayette would {{not have anything to}} do with Napoleon's government. In 1802, Lafayette was part of the tiny minority that voted no in the referendum that made Bonaparte consul for life. Bonaparte offered to appoint Lafayette to the Senate and to bestow the Legion of Honor upon him, but Lafayette declined, though he stated he would gladly have taken the honors from a democratic government.|$|E
5|$|De Lacy {{witnessed}} charters of the Empress in 1141. During {{the later}} 1140s, de Lacy was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recover</b> {{many of his}} father's Welsh marcher lands, {{and one of his}} efforts at Ludlow was later embroidered in the medieval romance Fouke le Fitz Waryn. He and Miles of Gloucester were claimants to many of the same lands, and during Stephen's reign were generally {{on opposite sides of the}} succession dispute. In June 1153, de Lacy was in the company of Matilda's son, Henry fitzEmpress, who became King Henry II of England in 1154.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the damage done by}} the bullet, the autopsy also found that the President was suffering from cardiomyopathy (fatty degeneration of the heart muscle). This would have weakened his heart and made him less <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recover</b> from such an injury, and was thought to be related to his overweight frame and lack of exercise. Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic necrosis, a condition that is difficult to treat today and would have been completely impossible for the doctors of his time.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the defence}} of the Byzantine coasts and the {{approaches}} to Constantinople was {{borne by the}} great fleet of the Karabisianoi. Progressively however it was split up into several regional (thematic) fleets, while a central Imperial Fleet was maintained at Constantinople, guarding the city and forming the core of naval expeditions. By the late 8th century, the Byzantine navy, a well-organized and maintained force, was again the dominant maritime power in the Mediterranean. The antagonism with the Muslim navies continued with alternating success, but in the 10th century, the Byzantines were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recover</b> a position of supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine forces, under Licario's command, now (in 1272/1273) {{launched}} a campaign that took the fortresses of Larmena, La Cuppa, Clisura and Manducho. The Lombard triarchs then appealed to their liege-lord, Prince William II of Achaea, and to Dreux de Beaumont, marshal of the Angevin Kingdom of Sicily. William was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recover</b> La Cuppa, but de Beaumont was defeated in a pitched battle and was subsequently recalled by Charles of Anjou. Between then and 1275, according to the Venetian chronicler Marino Sanudo, Licario himself served in the Byzantine army in Asia Minor, where he scored a victory against the Turks.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the bay where the pirates were said to be, Alligator dispatched boats to engage the enemy vessels, as the water was too shallow for the warship to engage them directly. With Allen personally commanding one of the boats, the Americans assaulted the schooner Revenge. Although the Navy was able to force the pirates into abandoning Revenge, the buccaneers managed to fight {{their way out of}} the bay and inflict seven casualties. With their commander mortally wounded, the boats ceased pursuit of the pirates, but were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recover</b> the vessels that had been held in the bay.|$|E

5|$|Alexios was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recover</b> {{a number}} of {{important}} cities and islands, and in fact much of western Asia Minor. Nevertheless, the Catholic/Latin crusaders believed their oaths were invalidated when Alexios did not help them during the siege of Antioch (he had in fact set out on the road to Antioch but had been persuaded to turn back by Stephen of Blois, who assured him that all was lost and that the expedition had already failed). Bohemund, who had set himself up as Prince of Antioch, briefly went to war with the Byzantines, but he agreed to become Alexios' vassal under the Treaty of Devol in 1108, which marked the end of the Norman threat during Alexios' reign.|$|E

For his actions in volunteering to stay behind with the wounded, Herman G. Felhoelter was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the second highest decoration for valor awarded by the U.S. military. He was the first chaplain of the war to receive an award for valor. He received a brief obituary in Time Magazine in December 1952. Felhoelter was the first of twelve chaplains killed or missing at that point in the war, including Emil J. Kapaun, the second chaplain of the war to be awarded a Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 29, Michael Johnson {{was engaged}} to be married to a local woman, Mary Neild, but she {{cancelled}} the engagement. Twenty years later, in 1706, he married Sarah Ford. She came from a middle-class milling and farming family and was twelve years his junior, daughter of Cornelius Ford. Although both families had money, Samuel Johnson often claimed that he grew up in poverty. It is uncertain what happened between the marriage of his parents and Samuel's birth three years later to provoke a decline in the family's fortunes, but Michael Johnson quickly became overwhelmed with debt from which he was never <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recover.</b>|$|E
