5|$|The {{trials were}} fraught with irregularities. All three judges were pro-Goebel Democrats, {{and at one}} point the juror pool of 368 people was found to have only eight Republicans. Republican appeals courts {{overturned}} Powers' and Howard's convictions, though Powers was tried three more times, resulting in two convictions and <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> <b>jury</b> and Howard was tried and convicted twice more. Both men were pardoned in 1908 by Governor Augustus E. Willson.|$|E
5|$|Innes' {{case against}} Marshall ended in <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> <b>jury</b> in 1814. Rather than retry the case, Marshall and Innes signed an {{agreement}} to end the legal battle in 1815. The agreement stipulated that neither man would write or publish anything that was disrespectful of the other. Innes upheld {{his part of the}} agreement, but in 1824, eight years after Innes' death, Marshall published an updated two-volume version of his History of Kentucky that was even more critical of Innes and others he suspected of participating in the Spanish Conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|Between 1973 and 1977, in New York and New Jersey, Shakur {{was indicted}} ten times, {{resulting}} in seven different criminal trials. Shakur {{was charged with}} two bank robberies, the kidnapping of a Brooklyn heroin dealer, the attempted murder of two Queens police officers stemming from a January 23, 1973 failed ambush, and eight other felonies related to the Turnpike shootout. Of these trials, three resulted in acquittals, one in <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> <b>jury,</b> one in a change of venue, one in a mistrial due to pregnancy, and one in a conviction; three indictments were dismissed without trial.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, Nash {{was tried}} {{in state court}} for having planned the murders; the trial {{resulted}} in <b>an</b> 11-1 <b>hung</b> <b>jury.</b> Nash would later admit that he had bribed the lone holdout, a young woman, with $50,000. The retrial ended in an acquittal.|$|R
5000|$|Larry King, a 15-year-old student, {{was murdered}} by fellow 14-year-old classmate Brandon McInerney on February 12, 2008. The first trial ended in <b>a</b> mistrial (<b>hung</b> <b>jury)</b> after McInerney's defense lawyers claimed he had [...] "reached an {{emotional}} breaking point in response to King's advances" [...] and that he felt threatened by King, who had [...] "returned taunts from McInerney and other boys with sexual overtures and declarations of love." [...] In 2011, McInerney pleaded guilty to second degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, and use of a gun to avoid a second trial, {{and was sentenced to}} 21 years imprisonment.|$|R
5|$|Nixon {{had built}} {{part of his}} {{reputation}} in the House on {{his role in the}} Alger Hiss affair. Hiss's retrial for perjury after <b>a</b> July 1949 <b>hung</b> <b>jury</b> was <b>a</b> cloud over Nixon's campaign; if Hiss was acquitted, Nixon's candidacy would be in serious danger. On January 21, 1950, the jury found Hiss guilty, and Nixon received hundreds of congratulatory messages, including one from the only living former President, Herbert Hoover.|$|R
5|$|Kinne went {{to trial}} {{for the murder of}} Patricia Jones in June 1961 and was acquitted. A January 1962 trial on charges of murdering her husband ended in {{conviction}} and a sentence of life in prison, but the verdict was overturned because of procedural irregularities. The case went to a second trial, which ended within days in a mistrial. A third trial on the charge of murdering her husband ended in <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> <b>jury</b> in July 1964. Kinne was released on bond following the third trial and subsequently traveled to Mexico before a scheduled fourth trial could be held in October 1964.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{opened his}} {{practice}} in Lexington. He established his reputation {{in one of}} his first casesthe trial of William Moseby, a black man accused of murder. Moseby's first trial had ended in <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> <b>jury,</b> but because the evidence against him included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his second trial. Unable to find a defense lawyer for Moseby, the judge in the case turned to Morrow, who as a young lawyer was eager for work. Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he had been told that a lynch mob waited outside the jail for him, but no such mob had ever existed. Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client was false. Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks before}} Garza's death, {{a woman named}} Maria America Guerra had been sexually {{assaulted}} while kneeling at the communion rail at another Catholic church in the area. Rumor held that Father Feit was responsible, but local church leaders discouraged people from considering {{the possibility that a}} priest could have been involved in a violent crime. Feit admitted to visiting a priest at that church on the day of Guerra's attack, but he denied assaulting her. He was later charged with rape, and the trial ended in <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> <b>jury.</b> In 1962, rather than facing a second trial, Feit entered a plea of no contest to a misdemeanor charge of aggravated assault, and he paid a $500 fine. Years later, Feit said he did not understand that a no contest plea would result in his conviction.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first trial}} of Avila for {{interfering with the}} tracks {{was held at the}} then newly opened Orange County Superior Court under Edward Eugenes, a [...] "hot shot" [...] legal figure who was also in the state assembly. The first trial ended with <b>a</b> 6-6 <b>hung</b> <b>jury.</b> In the week leading up to the retrial, rumors spread that Avila was {{pregnant}} out of wedlock, an act considered to be gravely sinful at the time. Her lawyer, George Hayford [...] "inexperienced and probably crooked", was forced to confirm that she was pregnant and believed that the real decision to incarcerate her for three years in San Quentin State Prison was largely due to this, writing that [...] "her real crime is that she is a poor girl not having sense enough to have been married". Hayford appealed to the court on grounds that she had been [...] "convicted on her reputation, not her deed". He received a hearing at the Supreme Court, but lost the case on a technicality. Avila's case was perhaps also used as the [...] "vehicle for polishing Orange County’s law-and-order image", as she {{was the first person to}} be convicted of a felony in the county. Avila's boyfriend at the time was fired from his job for refusing to distance himself from her.|$|R

5|$|According to the prosecution's theory, {{the assassin}} shot Goebel from the {{secretary}} of state's office {{on the first floor}} of a building next to the state capitol. However, much of the testimony against the accused men was conflicting, and some of it was later proven to be perjured. Most of the state's judges were Democratic supporters of Goebel and juries were packed with partisan Democrats. The appellate courts, however, were largely Republican, and the convictions returned by the lower courts were often overturned, with the cases being remanded for new trials. Howard was tried and convicted in September 1900, January 1902, and April 1903; his final appeal failed, and he was sentenced to life in prison. Powers was also convicted three times—in July 1900, October 1901, and August 1903; a fourth trial in November 1907 ended in <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> <b>jury.</b> In 1908, Powers and Howard were pardoned by Republican governor Augustus E. Willson. Months later, Willson also issued pardons for former governor Taylor and several others still under indictment. Despite the pardon, Taylor seldom returned to Kentucky; he became an insurance executive in Indiana and died there in 1928. Youtsey, the only defendant not to appeal his sentence, was paroled in 1916 and pardoned in 1919 by Democratic governor James D. Black.|$|E

5000|$|From the beginning, Susan McDougal {{charged that}} Starr offered her [...] "global immunity" [...] from other charges {{if she would}} {{cooperate}} with the Whitewater investigation. McDougal told the jury that refusing {{to answer questions about}} the Clintons and Whitewater wasn't easy for her, or her family. [...] "It's been a long road, a very long road...and it was not an easy decision to make", McDougal told the court. McDougal refused to answer any questions while under oath, leading to her being imprisoned by the judge for civil contempt of court for the maximum 18 months, including eight months in isolation. Starr's subsequent indictment of McDougal for criminal contempt of court charges resulted in <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> <b>hung</b> 7-5, in favor of acquittal. President Clinton later pardoned her, shortly before leaving office (see list of people pardoned by Bill Clinton).|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> {{decision}} when <b>hung</b> <b>juries</b> and retrials are possible. When {{jurors in}} subsequent trials know that previous trials resulted in <b>hung</b> <b>juries,</b> informative voting cannot be an equilibrium regardless of voting rules unless {{the probability that}} each juror receives the correct signal when the defendant is guilty {{is identical to the}} one when he is innocent. Thus, while Coughlan (2000) claims that mistrials facilitate informative voting, our result shows that such an assertion holds only in limited circumstances. ...|$|R

40|$|This study tested {{three models}} of group {{interaction}} {{for their ability}} to discriminate between groups that reach consensus and those that do not. Fifteen mock <b>juries</b> (seven <b>hung</b> and eight conviction) constituted the sample. Model 1, a “functional action model, ” successfully discriminated between consensus and <b>hung</b> <b>juries</b> based on the relative number of simple disagreements. Model 2, an “interact pattern model, ” successfully discriminated between consensus and <b>hung</b> <b>juries</b> based on the sequential redundancy of interaction patterns that perpetuate or resolve ambiguity, that digress from the work at hand, and that clarify or resolve conflict. Model 3, Fisher’s four phases of development, failed to discriminate between consensus and <b>hung</b> <b>juries.</b> Researchers studying small group decision making have a clear mandate to investigate relationships between the structure of social interaction and group performance outcomes. A growing body of research evidence demonstrates that both the processual forms and the thematic content of group communication explain a significant proportion of variance in models linking individual and group-leve...|$|R
