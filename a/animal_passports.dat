It was followed by projects undertaken at the Wrsan wildlife sanctuary near Abu Dhabi {{at the request of}} Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates. Since then, she has been photographing Arabian falcons and falconers to examine [...] "the conceptual issues of the 'perceived exotic' of place and racial belonging", both as a Western stereotype and as a living practice. She has also been liaising with an assisting ornithologists in the region to develop <b>animal</b> <b>passports</b> to assist the regulation of the international rare species trade and the eradication of the illicit hunting-bird market.|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{transnational}} identification, {{tracking and}} surveillance of falcons {{is a matter}} of historic and contemporary concern in the Middle East and West Asia. Considerable research has been carried out to control the cross-border falcon trade and to conserve the sub-species of these animals. Conversely, the contemporary place of portraiture, and of reproductive technologies, in these predominately Islamic cultures offers a unique intersection of western technology with traditional Islamic culture. This research explores problems connected to photographic identification within the emerging field of <b>animal</b> <b>passports</b> and cross-border security via an investigation of the falcon in the Arabian Gulf, offering a unique approach to the visual representation of the non-human body. The Azure series consist of 27 large-scale mural metallic photographic images that investigate the aesthetic importance of animal portraiture and the scientific underpinnings and relevance of biometric facial recognition as applied to animals, specifically avian species. Through the application of innovative photographic and biometric imaging techniques the work offers first comprehensive study of the animal portrait as an agent of verifiable identity as applied to surveillance and authenticity. This project solves photographic identification problems associated with the emerging concept of <b>animal</b> <b>passports.</b> Using technical innovation in order to interrogate the shifting status of the animal body and associated codes of representation and conventions of photographic portraiture within Western and Oriental photography. The significance of the Azure series is demonstrated by their acquisition by the MCA, Sydney, display in solo shows at the United Arab Emirates Cultural Foundation, UAE and Sherman Galleries, Sydney and inclusion in the group exhibition The Artist Abroad at the ACP, Sydney...|$|E
40|$|Like us, {{some kinds}} of animals require {{passports}} to enable coming and going across national borders. Passports tell all kinds of multispecies stories, in which humans and nonhumans are entangled in myriad ways. But {{what is the meaning}} of passports — human or nonhuman? What kind of symbolic, legal, material, relational identity and not least control and disciplinary work do they “do”? One of the authors (LB) pondered these questions at Calais docks, in France, while regarding the six passports on the her lap — two for each species, human, dog, horse. To re-enter the U. K required scrutiny of these documents to ensure all were bona fide residents of that country. But while all three species had passports, defining some sort of identities and belonging, there are important differences. So, we might ask: what role do passports play, not only in producing identities, but also in relation to human-animal relationships across times, places and national borders? Whilst the stories told by human passports have been considered (e. g., Kumar; Lloyd), what stories do <b>animal</b> <b>passports</b> tell...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Beef {{traceability}} {{has become}} mandatory {{in many regions}} of the world and is typically achieved through the use of unique numerical codes on ear tags and <b>animal</b> <b>passports.</b> DNA-based traceability uses the animal's own DNA code to identify it and the products derived from it. Using SNaPshot, a primer-extension-based method, a multiplex of 25 SNPs in a single reaction has been practiced for reducing the expense of genotyping a panel of SNPs useful for identity control. Findings To further decrease SNaPshot 's cost, we introduced the Perl script SNPmplexViewer, which facilitates the analysis of trace files for reactions performed without the use of fluorescent size standards. SNPmplexViewer automatically aligns reference and target trace electropherograms, run with and without fluorescent size standards, respectively. SNPmplexViewer produces a modified target trace file containing a normalised trace in which the reference size standards are embedded. SNPmplexViewer also outputs aligned images of the two electropherograms together with a difference profile. Conclusions Modified trace files generated by SNPmplexViewer enable genotyping of SnaPshot reactions performed without fluorescent size standards, using common fragment-sizing software packages. SNPmplexViewer 's normalised output may also improve the genotyping software's performance. Thus, SNPmplexViewer is a general free tool enabling the reduction of SNaPshot 's cost as well as the fast viewing and comparing of trace electropherograms for fragment analysis.

5000|$|An ear tag usually {{carries an}} Animal Identification Number (AIN) or code for the animal, or for its herd or flock. Non {{electronic}} ear tags may be simply handwritten {{for the convenience}} of the farmer (these are known as [...] "management tags"). Alternatively this identification number (ID) may be assigned by an organisation, such as the Meat and Livestock Association (MLA), which is a not-for-profit organisation owned by cattle, sheep and goat producers; funded by a levy on livestock sales with Federal Government input. Electronic tags may also show other information about the animal, including other related identification numbers; such as the Property Identiﬁcation Code (PIC) for the properties the animals have been located. In the case of MLA's NLIS the movement of certain species of livestock (primarily cattle, goats and sheep) must be recorded in the online database within 24 hours of the movement; and include the PICs of the properties the animals are travelling between. The National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) of Australia regulations require that all cattle be fitted with a RFID device {{in the form of an}} ear tag or rumen bolus (a cylindrical object placed in the rumen) before movement from the property and that the movement be reported to the NLIS. However, if animals are tagged for internal purposes in a herd or farm, IDs need not be unique in larger scales. The NLIS now also requires sheep and goats to use an ear tag that has the Property Identiﬁcation Code inscribed on it. These ear tags and boluses are complemented by transport documents supplied by vendors that are used for identification and tracking. A similar system is used for cattle in the European Union (EU), each bovine <b>animal</b> having a <b>passport</b> document and tag in each ear carrying the same number (see British Cattle Movement Service). Sheep and goats in the EU have a tag in one or both ears carrying the official number of their flock and also for breeding stock an individual number for each animal; one of these tags (usually the left) must have a RFID chip (or the chip may instead be carried in a rumen bolus or on an anklet).|$|R
40|$|Firms {{within the}} food supply chain must decide what {{information}} to provide and how to provide it. This applies to collecting information from upstream suppliers {{as well as to}} supplying information to downstream customers. Components of this vertical information situation include farmer supplier identity preservation to capture value and the buyer information needs concerning geographic location of production or seller identity in order to manage risk. A policy question is raised as to how vertical information flow; in the form of segregation, traceability, or identity preservation, should be accomplished. This question has recently come to the policy forefront through European labeling/traceability issues, the Canadian BSE incident, Country of Origin Labeling legislation, and biosecurity concerns. The US food industry often contends that mandated macro government systems (e. g. full traceability systems, <b>animal</b> <b>passports,</b> ISO 9000) would be misplaced and ineffective. They point to the tremendous private quality control systems, already in place in the industry. Though the industry's quality systems may not be in the public domain as in Europe, they are nonetheless present. The argument continues that proprietary systems contribute to a firm's competitive advantage and mandating a system would distort investment and incentives. Within this classic debate about public policy versus private strategies is a fundamental question about the role of commodities in the economy. Are they an inferior form of market development whereby the natural and preferred tendency is for supply to differentiate? Put another way is the economy better off with differentiated or undifferentiated (commodity) basic inputs? This article contributes to the policy debate by discussing why and how commodities many times are preferred by end users and thereby a signal of a properly performing economy not a market "failure. " The discussion will also shed light on why farmer premiums remain low and how greater value can be created at the production stage. Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|E
40|$|Preface Whenever {{animals are}} used in research, {{minimizing}} pain and distress and promoting good welfare should be as important an objective as achieving the experimental results. This is important for humanitarian reasons, for good science, for economic reasons {{and in order to}} satisfy the broad legal principles in international legislation. It is possible to refine both husbandry and procedures to minimize suffering and improve welfare in a number of ways, and this can be greatly facilitated by ensuring that up-to-date information is readily available. The need to provide such information led the British Veterinary Association Animal Welfare Foundation (BVAAWF), the Fund for the Replacement of Animals in Medical Experiments (FRAME), the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) and the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare (UFAW) to establish a Joint Working Group on Refinement (JWGR) in the UK. The chair is Professor David Morton and the secretariat is provided by the RSPCA. This report is the ninth in the JWGR series. The RSPCA is opposed to the use of animals in experiments that cause pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm and together with FRAME has particular concerns about the continued use of non-human primates. The replacement of primate experiments is a primary goal for the RSPCA and FRAME. However, both organizations share with others in the Working Group, the common aim of replacing primate experiments wherever possible, reducing suffering and improving welfare while primate use continues. The reports of the refinement workshops are intended to help achieve these aims. This report produced by the British Veterinary Association Animal Welfare Foundation (BVAAWF) /Fund for the Replacement of Animals in Medical Experiments (FRAME) /Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) /Universities Federation for Animal Welfare (UFAW) Joint Working Group on Refinement (JWGR) sets out practical guidance on refining the husbandry and care of non-human primates (hereinafter primates) and on minimizing the adverse effects of some common procedures.
