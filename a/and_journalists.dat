5|$|After two years, {{the account}} went viral in 2011.

The effect was so dramatic that audiences <b>and</b> <b>journalists</b> speculated {{about how it was}} achieved. Theories included claims that Mansfield had an inflatable rubber prosthetic, that he applied chemicals, and that he had a mask hidden in a wig, which he pulled down to complete the change.|$|E
