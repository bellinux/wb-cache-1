5000|$|The Chrome Buster (Kuromu Basutā) {{is first}} used in Act:03. It is a {{concentrated}} energy beam fired from Big O's crown. The weapon is charged when Big O points its forearms upward and continues charging until Big O slams its fists together {{in front of}} it, at which point a beam fires continuously until the megadeus' hands separate. The beam can be sustained {{for a long time}} ("Day of The Advent") or fired in short continuous bursts ("Hydra"), though its output grows weaker the longer it is sustained. The material that makes up Big O's crown and cockpit canopy can deflect beams ("Beck Comes Back") but it can also crack under pressure ("Enemy is Another Big!") and even be destroyed ("The Show Must Go On").

5000|$|Big Fau's primary {{weapons were}} the {{turbines}} mounted just below its hands known as [...] "Saw Cuffs". When activated, they could grind through practically any material or even allow Big Fau to drill its fist straight through an opponent's body. The fists themselves could also spin, giving the megadeus' punches {{an incredible amount}} of destructive power. Additional weapons included two heavy beam cannons mounted in its shoulders, the standard <b>Arc</b> <b>Line</b> laser eyes which all Big type megadeuses have and laser projectors that extended on flexible periscope-like extensions from its back. Big Fau was also able to fire its arms at an opponent, the turbines drilling through any obstacle before detonating. Big Fau is equipped with some kind of energy shield which can repel Big O's fists and other matter-based attacks (missiles, bullets etc.). Judging by Big Fau's streamlined appearance, its turbine wrists, its ability to travel effortlessly through the water shown in the final episode, its conning tower shaped head as well as a conning tower on its back, and the flexible periscope-like laser cannons on its back, it is likely that Big Fau units were used primarily for naval combat, functioning as heavily armed amphibious craft, and providing ocean-based combat support for land- and air-based megadeuses.|$|E
50|$|It {{was found}} by the former {{reporter}} in an abandoned hangar in the desert {{to the south of}} Paradigm City, as revealed in a flashback in Act:17. When it first appears, the entire megadeus is wrapped in bandages, hiding its true nature until Schwarzwald reveals himself. Roger is able to defeat Big Duo by grounding it and crushing its head, taking out one of its arms in the process. However, Big Duo still moves without a head or a pilot, and as a final act it reaches towards Paradigm City's center before shutting down. It is possible that the semi-sentient megadeus reaches for Paradigm HQ with the intentions of trying to carry out the wishes of Schwarzwald regardless of its defeat and crippling damage. R. Dorothy later investigated the nearby area and found traces of Angel's presence. Big Duo is the only megadeus possessing the ability of flight, {{with the possible exception of}} Big Venus. Its propeller hands could also serve as a cutting weapon. Additional armaments included machine guns in its forearms, missile batteries in its chest, a pair of high ordnance missiles stored in its knees and the <b>Arc</b> <b>Line,</b> a beam weapon found in the eyes of all three Bigs. Big Duo was also capable of producing a smoke screen. Due to its great speed and heft, it was effective at using its entire body as a battering weapon.

5000|$|Alex Rosewater later salvages the {{wreckage}} of Big Duo, seen in Act:13. Using the salvaged remains of the Archetype, Rosewater is able to modify Big Duo into Big Duo Inferno (Biggu Dyuo Inferuno), now with a new head and arms with sharp red and white claws that enable it to drill, {{as well as a}} flame paint job on its arms. The repeating missile launchers in its chest were removed for reasons unknown (leaving clean holes straight through the chest), and its <b>Arc</b> <b>Line</b> was converted from the typical twin beams to a single emitter in its larger left eye. Rosewater gives the megadeus to cyborg Alan Gabriel as payment for his services, with the cyborg hard-wired directly to the controls. Alan uses the Big Duo Inferno on Roger, who realized the megadeus was the same Big Duo he previously fought, when commenting [...] "However, that isn't the megadeus's original form". After Roger uses the O Thunder attack to decapitate the megadeus, Alan manages to surprise and almost kill Roger. However, Big Duo Inferno suddenly attacks Alan with wires after displaying the message [...] "Ye Guilty", implying Alan was not worthy to pilot the megadeus. Big Duo Inferno then launches itself into the air, slowly rising higher {{over the course of the}} final three episodes. Alan is seemingly killed by Big Duo's wiring before being ejected out. Schwarzwald's image appeared and his thoughts were heard by Alan as Big Duo rejected the mummified cyborg. Big Duo Inferno finally explodes when it collides with what appears to be a gigantic stage light, miles above Paradigm City.|$|E

Finally, the tooth surface and the contact line are simulated with mathematical software. The results suggests that the contact line between two curvilinear-tooth cylindrical gears is an <b>arc</b> <b>line</b> in the surface of action; and this line, shaped as an <b>arc</b> <b>line</b> in the generating plane of the tooth surface, is longer than that of the spur or helical gear with the same face width...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} {{interaction between}} adherent cells and their substrate {{relies on the}} formation of adhesion sites and on the stabilization of contractile acto-myosin bundles, or stress fibers. The shape of the cell and the orientation of these fibers can be controlled by adhesive patterning. On nonadhesive gaps, fibroblasts develop thick peripheral stress fibers, with a concave curvature. The radius of curvature of these arcs results from {{the balance of the}} line tension in the arc and of the surface tension in the cell bulk. However, the nature of these forces, and in particular the contribution of myosin-dependent contractility, is not clear. To get insight into the force balance, we inhibit myosin activity and simultaneously monitor the dynamics of peripheral arc radii and traction forces. We use these measurements to estimate line and surface tension. We found that myosin inhibition led to a decrease in the traction forces and an increase in arc radius, indicating that both line tension and surface tension dropped, but the line tension decreased to a lesser extent than surface tension. These results suggest that myosin-independent force contributes to tension in the peripheral arcs. We propose a simple physical model in which the peripheral <b>arc</b> <b>line</b> tension is due to the combination of myosin II contractility and a passive elastic component, while surface tension is largely due to active contractility. Numerical solutions of this model reproduce well the experimental data and allow estimation of the contributions of elasticity and contractility to the <b>arc</b> <b>line</b> tension...|$|E

With the view of determining the ratio of the nuclear magnetic moments of the two isotopes, the hyperfiine structure, arising from the nuclear spin moments of (-',) (h/ 2) and (-',) (h/ 2) of the isotopes 191 and 193, respectively, has been investigated for a few more iridium lines using an aluminized Fabry-Perot etalon.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{load-carrying}} capacity latticed shells, an innovative optimum method {{based on the}} concept of compression line is proposed in this paper. The basic principle of this method is using the character without moment in compression line. The <b>arc</b> <b>line</b> which forms the contour line of sphere and latticed shell structures is substituted by compression line in this method. Then the latticed shell structures are in the state of compression, and the influence of bending stress reduces greatly. As a result, the load-carrying capacity of the latticed shell structure is increased. Through the geometrical nonlinear analysis of a sunflower-patterned single-layer latticed shell structure with a span of 48 m, it is found that the load-carrying capacity of the single-layer latticed shell structure can be improved by 5. 48 %. Furthermore, the results of 84 structural analyses of single-layer or double-layer sphere and cylinder latticed shell structures show that the optimum method is right and effective.

40|$|Line gear is a newly {{developed}} gear mechanism with point contact meshing according to space curve meshing theory. This paper proposes {{a new form}} of line gear with a couple of concave convex arc tooth profiles. It has four characteristics. First, contact curve of the driving line gear is a cylindrical spiral curve. Second, two axes of a pair of line gears are located in the same plane with an arbitrary angle. Third, at the mesh point, normal tooth profiles of a line gear pair are a couple of inscribed circles. Namely, they form a couple of concave convex tooth profiles. Fourth, the tooth profile of a driving line gear is a convex, that of a driven line gear is a concave, and they are interchangeable. If only consider that the arcs of teeth at meshing point are tangent, the actual tooth surfaces may interfere outside of the meshing point. In this paper, the geometric condition of the tooth surface for a concave convex <b>arc</b> <b>line</b> gear mechanism is derived, and the optimal formulae of the tooth profile parameters are derived on basis of interference proof conditions. Finally, the 3 -D modeling and kinematic simulation of line gear pairs show that the proposed line gear pairs can perform transmission normally.
