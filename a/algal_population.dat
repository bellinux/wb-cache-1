In the Republic of South Africa and in South West Africa sudden <b>algal</b> <b>population</b> declines have occurred at times in maturation ponds. These declines cause serious problems in the reclamation of purified sewage effluents for re-use. The possible causes of these declines are considered here from the physical, biological and chemical observations of an experimental maturation pond system. The algal populations of the system fluctuated from very high to very low cell concentrations. High algal cell concentrations were only maintained for short periods of time. Zooplankton grazing was responsible for removing algae from the system at times but this was not the primary cause of all the <b>algal</b> <b>population</b> declines. It is very likely that sudden increases in ammonia nitrogen concentration when the pH was high, caused the <b>algal</b> <b>population</b> declines. Carbon deficiencies could (““have occurred during peak algal cell concentrations which would have resulted in population declines.

Despite trichome lengths exceeding {{the diameter of the}} sort droplets, filamentous cyanobacteria were amenable to population-specific cell sorting. In concert with 13 C-CO 2 labeling, the combined use of flow cytometric cell sorting and Py-GC-IRMS enabled both the assessment of standing stocks and of population-specific growth rates of the predominant cyanobacterial and algal taxa in Lake Loosdrecht (The Netherlands). Filamentous prochlorophytes, formerly the dominant cyanobacterial taxon in the lake, appeared less abundant in recent years and exhibited growth rates 30 %- 40 % lower than the rates recorded for oscillatorioid populations.

40|$|Abstract This work aims to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of using image-based cytometry (IBC) {{in the analysis of}} algal cell quantification and viability, using Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata as a cell model. Cell concentration was deter-mined by IBC to be in a linear range between 1 × 105 and 8 × 106 cells mL− 1. Algal viability was defined on the basis that the intact membrane of viable cells excludes the SYTOX Green (SG) probe. The disruption of membrane integrity represents irreversible damage and consequently results in cell death. Using IBC, we were able to successfully discriminate between live (SG-negative cells) and dead algal cells (heat-treated at 65 °C for 60 min; SG-positive cells). The observed viability of <b>algal</b> <b>populations</b> containing different proportions of killed cells was well correlated (R 2 = 0. 994) with the theo-retical viability. The validation of the use of this technology was carried out by exposing algal cells of P. subcapitata to a copper stress test for 96 h. IBC allowed us to follow the evolution of cell concentration and the viability of copper-exposed <b>algal</b> <b>populations.</b> This technology overcomes sever-al main drawbacks usually associated with microscopy counting, such as labour-intensive experiments, tedious work and lack of the representativeness of the cell counting.
