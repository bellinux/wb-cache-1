40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{two different ways}} in which learners construct personal semantic maps, expressed by navigational behaviours. The first of them concerns the usage of hypermedia structures nonsequentially, i. e. without following a strict order within two nodes; the second one concerns the usage of glossaries and concepts maps. A data driven approach, described in the paper, is used. The dataset is made by 254 sessions realized by learners interacting with the WINDS <b>Advanced</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>Environment.</b> The results show that the differences in two behaviours are statistically significant;that the usage of maps and glossaries is less frequent than the usage of hypertextual structure; that the usage of maps and glossaries is clustered above all around a single course; that when different from zero, the two behaviours have statistically significant opposite trends. We can conclude that the presence of two different behaviours of non sequential navigation in Electronic Learning Environments is likely, and that the corresponding strategies are likely to be learned.

This technology-based methodology represents an update of traditional Instructional System Design methods that have been used for training analyses. The method divides the training of each task into four steps: Familiarization, Acquiring the skills, Practicing the skills, and Validating the skills. We use the acronym FAPV to refer to these four steps. We have implemented the FAPV analysis with a tool that starts with a database of tasks and training times. The tool allows dynamic tradeoffs across a variety of variables, including student loads, choice of training devices, available facilities, student/instructor ratios, and training device reliability.

In this paper we present an approach to ontology maintenance based on the use of collaborative tags contributed by learners while using <b>learning</b> <b>environments.</b> Our contribution is twofold: i) a visualization and user interaction interface supporting the tasks of enriching ontologies with selected collaborative tags; and ii) ontology-enhanced metrics that are used for measuring semantic relatedness between collaborative tags and ontology concepts and for recommending tags which are relevant to a given ontological concept. We developed a software architecture as a proof of concept and a tool for the evaluation of our proposal.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{argues that}} the notion of <b>learning</b> <b>environment</b> is not a {{theoretical}} concept that can serve as the centerpiece and unit of analysis in research on computer-supported collaborative learning, and that the preoccupation in this research domain with implementation of digital <b>learning</b> <b>environments</b> is a largely misguided consequence of the unquestioned expectation that technology will radically change learning. The pa-per suggests that these two pervasive weaknesses may be at least partially overcome by ex-amining activity systems as an alternative unit of analysis and by focusing on expansive learning instead of implementation as such.

These agents should exhibit three properties: timely domain coverage (they should clearly communicate fundamental concepts and relationships within the allotted time) � contextuality (they should provide explanations in appropriate problem-solving contexts) � and continuity (their activities and utterances should be pedagogically, visually, and aurally coherent). We have developed the coherence-structured behavior space approach to creating animated pedagogical agents. This is a two-step approach. First, we design a behavior space of animation and audio segments that are structured by prerequisite relationships and a continuity metric. Second, we navigate coherent paths through the space to dynamically sequence behaviors.
