His mobile guard moved quickly from one point to another, <b>always</b> <b>changing</b> the course of events wherever they appeared, and then just as quickly galloping away to change the course of events elsewhere on the field.|$|E
5|$|These {{ecological}} systems are <b>always</b> <b>changing</b> due to environmental factors. Geographic {{features such as}} the Western Flatwoods, Eastern Flatwoods, and the Atlantic Coastal Ridge affect drainage patterns. Geologic elements, climate, {{and the frequency of}} storms and fire are formative processes for the Everglades. They help to sustain and transform the ecosystems in the Shark River Valley, Big Cypress Swamp, coastal areas and mangrove forests. Ecosystems have been described as both fragile and resilient. Minor fluctuations in water levels have far-reaching consequences for many plant and animal species, and the system cycles and pulses with each change.|$|E
5|$|The {{scope of}} ecology {{contains}} {{a wide array}} of interacting levels of organization spanning micro-level (e.g., cells) to a planetary scale (e.g., biosphere) phenomena. Ecosystems, for example, contain abiotic resources and interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms that aggregate into populations which aggregate into distinct ecological communities). Ecosystems are dynamic, they do not always follow a linear successional path, but they are <b>always</b> <b>changing,</b> sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that it can take thousands of years for ecological processes to bring about certain successional stages of a forest. An ecosystem's area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem, but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it. Several generations of an aphid population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, support diverse bacterial communities. The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole. Some ecological principles, however, do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole, such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame.|$|E

25|$|Figure 1 {{illustrates}} {{velocity and}} acceleration vectors for uniform motion at four {{different points in}} the orbit. Because the velocity v is tangent to the circular path, no two velocities point in the same direction. Although the object has a constant speed, its direction is <b>always</b> <b>changing.</b> This change in velocity is caused by an acceleration a, whose magnitude is (like that of the velocity) held constant, but whose direction also is <b>always</b> <b>changing.</b> The acceleration points radially inwards (centripetally) and is perpendicular to the velocity. This acceleration is known as centripetal acceleration.|$|E

25|$|The work of Raymond Williams {{and other}} members of the Birmingham Center for British Cultural Studies would further extend the notion of {{mediation}} in cultural materialism.

25|$|Before Darwin, {{adaptation}} {{was seen}} as a fixed relationship between an organism and its habitat. It was not appreciated that as the climate changed, so did the habitat; and as the habitat changed, so did the biota. Also, habitats are subject to changes in their biota: for example, invasions of species from other areas. The relative numbers of species in a given habitat are <b>always</b> <b>changing.</b> Change is the rule, though much depends on the speed and degree of the change.|$|E
25|$|In other cases, {{opinions}} differ, {{no consensus}} is forthcoming, {{and all are}} free to choose. With agreement among the Fathers, though, the authority of interpretation grows, and full patristic consensus is very strong. With canon law (which tends to be highly rigorous and very strict, especially with clergy) an unalterable validity also does not apply, since canons deal with living on earth, where conditions are <b>always</b> <b>changing</b> and each case is subject to almost infinite variation from the next. Even when and where they were once used with full strictness, their application was not absolute, and was carried out for individuals under the pastoral care of their bishop, who {{had the authority to}} decide when individual discipline had been satisfied. This too {{is a part of the}} Holy Tradition.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of the New 52 Superman, Luthor decides to assume Superman's symbol in a new suit of battle-armour (apparently powered by a Mother Box) to protect Metropolis, but he is confronted by the pre-Flashpoint Superman, who refuses to believe that Luthor's {{intentions}} are as noble as he claims. This results in a brief conflict between the two, Luthor claiming that Superman's 'unprovoked' attack proves that he is an impostor while Superman counters that Luthor's brutal response proves him right, but the fight is cut short when Doomsday apparently emerges. Despite Superman's uncertainty about Luthor and Luthor's own beliefs about Superman, Superman convinces Luthor to help him by focusing on evacuating civilians while he deals with Doomsday due to his greater experience. After the crisis is over, Superman talks with Luthor and agrees to let him continue acting as a hero using his logo when Superman concedes that he has no clear evidence that this Luthor has any criminal activity. Luthor is later attacked by an alien warrior who attacks people who, according to visions of the future he receives, will go on to commit various acts of death and violence, but Superman appeals to them to let Luthor free by arguing that the future is <b>always</b> <b>changing</b> and he will do his best to ensure that the dark future they foresaw for Luthor will never come to pass.|$|E

500|$|Borders {{are another}} theme in Chatwin's work. According to Elizabeth Chatwin, he [...] "was {{interested}} in borders, where things were <b>always</b> <b>changing,</b> not {{one thing or}} another." [...] Patagonia, {{the subject of his}} first published book, is an area that is in both Argentina and Chile. The Viceroy of Ouidah is a Brazilian who trades slaves in Dahomey.

500|$|Although {{his views}} on {{politics}} were <b>always</b> <b>changing,</b> Balzac was primarily a legitimist who supported the House of Bourbon and believed that the July Revolution of 1830 had left France without strong leadership. In 1832 he declared his intent {{to run for the}} Chamber of Deputies in the French Parliament. A variety of problems prevented his actual candidacy, but he mounted a serious campaign which was met mostly with ridicule by the press. Referring to Balzac's breakthrough 1831 novel La Peau de chagrin ("The Wild Ass's Skin"), the newspaper Le Figaro mused: [...] "This is the first time anyone has been seen caressing the voters with an ass's skin." [...] Although he later showed renewed interest in public office, he mostly expressed his political views through writing.|$|E

500|$|Worsley captained {{for just}} two seasons. He {{struggled}} {{with the demands of}} fielding, while his batting was disappointing. However, he was widely respected by the team. He was slightly more effective in his second season as leader, after which he retired. The next skipper, Alan Barber, although regarded as successful, captained for just one season. He was a more accomplished batsman and a great disciplinarian. However, he chose a career in teaching, limiting his availability, and resigned. The captain after that, Frank Greenwood, also did not hold the post long, resigning due to business commitments. Lord Hawke, writing in 1932, noted there had been eight captains since he retired in 1910. While six of them won the County Championship in their first season in charge, he stated that [...] "it is not good for a side to be <b>always</b> <b>changing</b> its captain". Only when Brian Sellers was appointed in 1933 did Yorkshire gain the leader they wanted. After skippering most games in 1932 during Greenwood's frequent absences, he remained in the role until 1947 and was considered the best county captain of his time.|$|E
500|$|Others, like {{journalist}} Nick Gillespie, see The Great Gatsby {{as a story}} [...] "underlying {{permanence of}} class differences; {{even in the face}} of a modern economy's attempt to assert that the class structure is based; not on status and inherited position; but, upon the innovation and the ability of literally anyone, to succeed by meeting the ever-changing demands and tastes of consumers' needs." [...] This interpretation asserts that The Great Gatsby captures the American experience because it is a story about change and those who resist it; whether the change comes in the form of a new wave of immigrants (Southern Europeans in the early 20th century, Latin Americans today), the nouveau riche, or successful minorities, Americans from the 1920s to modern day have plenty of experience with changing economic and social circumstances. As Gillespie states, [...] "While the specific terms of the equation are <b>always</b> <b>changing,</b> it's easy to see echoes of Gatsbys basic conflict between established sources of economic and cultural power and upstarts in virtually all aspects of American society." [...] Because this concept is particularly American and can be seen throughout American history, readers are able to relate to The Great Gatsby (which has lent the novel an enduring popularity).|$|E

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{process of}} social-culture transformation emerges a complex problematic in the sector of law; especially it is related {{with the law}} certainty. The clash of values occurred intensively and extensively fixes a polemic whether the law must be stable or is <b>always</b> in <b>changing.</b> The law that is <b>always</b> in <b>changing</b> will leave a certainty as an essential character of law. On the contrary, the law that stable in its nature will turn up a problem, it will not accommodate the internal dynamic. The sect of Sociological Jurisprudence, in its effort tries to formulate a harmonious synthesis by positing the significant meaning of customary law and the written constitution {{as a tool of}} social live arrangement in order to manage it better. The certainty of law will be achieved throughout continuous dialog process between rationality and experience, between fact that happen in the social life and the ideal normative of juridical values those are formulated in constitution. The certainty of law can be approached properly if it is supported by professional lawyer apparatus that has high moral integrity. The task of judge is not only to be speaker of constitution but also to enforce the justice. Therefore, the law enforcer should has sensitive feeling in understanding the phenomena of social justice that is desired by society, formulating the social justice in the constitution, and implementing the constitution wisely...|$|R
