25|$|Huygens was {{designed}} to enter and brake in Titan's atmosphere and parachute a fully instrumented robotic laboratory to the surface. When the mission was planned, {{it was not yet}} certain whether the landing site would be a mountain range, a flat plain, an ocean, or something else, and it was hoped that analysis of data from Cassini would help to <b>answer</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stephen Hawking and {{co-author}} Leonard Mlodinow state in their book, The Grand Design, {{that it is}} reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God.

25|$|Stephen Hawking and {{co-author}} Leonard Mlodinow state {{in their book}} The Grand Design that {{it is reasonable to}} ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. Both authors claim {{that it is possible to}} <b>answer</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings. Christian mathematicians and scientists, most notably Leonhard Euler, Bernard d'Espagnat and John Lennox, disagree with that kind of skeptical argument.|$|E
25|$|During 36 days of {{official}} investigations (spread over two months), testimony was recorded from nearly 100 {{witnesses in the}} form of answers to set questions that the process was designed to <b>answer.</b> <b>These</b> <b>questions,</b> combined with sometimes extensive cross-examination, resulted in over 25,000 questions being recorded in the official court records. With a cost of nearly £20,000 (£ at today's prices), it was the longest and most detailed court of inquiry in British history up to that time. Those testifying included surviving passengers and crew members, as well as captains and crew members of other ships in the vicinity, expert witnesses, government officials, and White Star Line officials and ship designers.|$|E
25|$|What greatly {{facilitates}} statistical accuracy {{by reducing}} non-response bias is that answering questions is sometimes required by law. Some surveys must be answered. This requirement lessens agency expense, practically eliminates non-response bias (a perennial headache for most private market researchers), and improves accuracy. For example, for the General Social Survey, people are selected randomly for 10-minute phone interviews which sometimes ask personal {{questions such as}} wage and salary information. But people must <b>answer</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> and won't be paid for their time. It's required by the Statistics Act 1975. This policy is substantially different from countries such as the United States, where answering official surveys is rarely compulsory, including responding to its census which is done every ten years. Further, if a person doesn't get a census survey for any reason, {{he or she is}} still obligated to visit a local census bureau, get one, fill it out, and return it; the government can't be held accountable for mixing up an address. Questionnaires can be downloaded from the Internet via the Statistics New Zealand website.|$|E

25|$|For centuries hashish and {{marijuana}} from the Indian hemp Cannabis sativa L. {{have been used}} for medicinal and recreational purposes. In 1840, Schlesinger S. was apparently the first investigator to obtain an active extract from the leaves and flowers of hemp. A few years later, in 1848, Decourtive E. described the preparation of an ethanol extract that on evaporation of the solvent gave a dark resin, which he named “cannabin”. In 1964 the main active constituent of C. sativa L., Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), was isolated and synthesized by Mechoulam's laboratory. Two types of cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, responsible for the effects of THC were discovered and cloned in the early 1990s. Once cannabinoid receptors had been discovered, it became important to establish whether their agonists occur naturally in the body. This search led to the discovery of the first endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid), anandamide (arachidonoyl ethanolamide). Later on other endocannabinoids were found, for example 2-AG (2-arachidonoyl glycerol). These findings raised further questions about the pharmacological and physiological role of the cannabinoid system. This revived the research on cannabinoid receptor antagonists which were expected to help <b>answer</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions.</b> The use of the cannabinoid agonist, THC, in its many preparations to enhance appetite is a well known fact. This fact led to the logical extension that blocking of the cannabinoid receptors might be useful in decreasing appetite and food intake. It was then discovered that the blockage of the CB1 receptor represented a new pharmacological target. The first specific CB1 receptor antagonist / inverse agonist was rimonabant, discovered in 1994.|$|E

2500|$|In the 19th century {{archaeology}} {{was often}} a supplement to history, and the goal of archaeologists was to identify artifacts according to their typology and stratigraphy, thus marking their location in time and space. Franz Boas established that archaeology be one of American anthropology's four fields, and debates among archaeologists have often paralleled debates among cultural anthropologists. In the 1920s and 1930s, Australian-British archaeologist V. Gordon Childe and American archaeologist W. C. McKern independently began moving from asking about the date of an artifact, to asking {{about the people who}} produced it— when archaeologists work alongside historians, historical materials generally help <b>answer</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions,</b> but when historical materials are unavailable, archaeologists had to develop new methods.

2500|$|Since winning {{his first}} Tour de France title in 2013, doubts over Froome's {{performances}} {{were raised by}} various experts, including former Festina coach Antoine Vayer. These allegations were based mainly on his sudden transformation from a relatively unknown rider to a Grand Tour winner, following his breakthrough performance in the 2011 Vuelta. After his dominant showing in the first mountain stage of 2015 Tour, the suspicions increased even further. In an attempt to <b>answer</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions,</b> Froome promised to undergo independent physiological testing soon after finishing the Tour. The test, arranged by Froome himself, took place shortly {{before the start of}} the Vuelta, on 17 August 2015, in the GlaxoSmithKline Human Performance lab in London. Several tests were carried to determine his maximum sustainable power for 20–40 minutes (threshold power), level of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max) and his peak power. Froome's peak power was measured at 525 W; his peak 20–40 minute power, at 419 W, corresponds to 79.8 percent of the maximum. At his current weight of [...] (of which 9.8% was body fat) at the time of test, this corresponds to a figures of 7.51 and 5.98 W/kg respectively.
