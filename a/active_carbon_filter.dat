50|$|Highly {{processed}} {{foods such as}} granola bars come in individual packaging, demanding high energy inputs and resulting in packaging waste. These products contribute up {{to a third of}} total energy inputs for food consumption, as their ingredients are shipped from all over, processed, packaged, trucked to storage, then transported to retail outlets. Bottled water is another example of a highly packaged, wasteful food product. It is estimated that Americans throw away 40 million plastic water bottles every day, and bottled water is often shipped trans-continentally. Carbonated water must be chilled and kept under pressure during storage and transport so as to keep the carbon dioxide dissolved. This factor contributes greater energy usage for products shipped longer distances.

40|$|Particle Adsorption, {{particle}} absorption and break through curves {{are of interest}} in diverse applications like automotive air filters, water filters and subsurface transport settings. They are notoriously difficult to predict because they depend on many parameters such as the adsorption capability of the material and the pore geometry of the porous media. The aim of this work is to propose ways to predict these quantities based on direct numerical simulations with the software GeoDict. At first an accurate three-dimensional micro-structural representation of the geometry of a porous media is constructed. Examples are the CT image of a fracture in granite, and the computer model of an <b>active</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>filter</b> media based on a micro CT image. Based on the microstructure model the fluid flow through the pores of the media is computed. The flow field {{is the basis for}} the third step, the tracking of particles, considering their interaction with the material surfaces and modelling the time-dependent absorption or adsorption on these surfaces. For the CT image of granite the break through curves were modelled and measured for the same rock sample. On the one hand, tracer particles are monitored, and on the other hand, break through curve simulations were performed on the CT image of the same sample. The comparison shows a good agreement between simulation and measurement. For the model of the <b>active</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>filter</b> media an iterative filtration simulation, with additional modelling of deposition-dependant surface-adsorption, is performed. The sub-grain porosity of the media is modelled by the effective surface adsorption on the grain surfaces...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Purpose of the study: The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{effectiveness}} of several types of personal respiratory protection equipment at styrene exposed laminators under real work place conditions. Subjects and method: 99 male styrene exposed workers were examined. During their lamination activities the average styrene concentrations in air ranged between 30 to 60 ppm (maximum: 205 ppm). The laminators were followed during an usual workweek from Monday to Thursday. The external styrene exposure was measured by means of passive active carbon badges. The excretion of mandelic acid (MA) and phenyl glyoxylic acid (PGA) in endof-shift urine samples was used to quantify the internal styrene load. During the work shift some laminators did not use respiratory protection masks. The majority used either a half face mask with <b>active</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>filter</b> or an air purifying respirator. Results: The respiratory masks were worn during an average between 31 % and 72 % of the work time. The styrene concentrations of the ambient air were-depending on the activity- in the range of 30 to 60 ppm. The end-ofshift concentrations of MA and PGA in urine samples varied considerably, their means range from 153 to 606 mg/g creatinine.

40|$|A {{possible}} {{method of}} protection of waterworks Hrastje against pollution {{is presented in}} this diploma. First chapter includes a description of water resources management model for Ljubljana field that is made in software tool for groundwater modeling called MIKE-SHE. In the following chapter is an outline of waterworks Hrastje, its pumping capacity, importance of its location and impacts of surrounding activities and examination of quality of pumped water. Threat to pollution with existing protection zones is tested with module for particle tracking in software tool MIKE-SHE. As a suitable solution active protection is suggested. The method is based on artificial recharge of groundwater. The infiltration forms so called »water curtain«, which pushes away potentially polluted water bellow the city and so protects the pumped drinking water from pollution. With that we acquire the control over {{quantity and quality of}} water before its infiltration {{and at the same time}} we are able to increase the pumping capacity of waterworks and reduce the protection zones. The water must be suitably prepared before infiltration. Three ways of water capture are described in greater detail (raw water from river, riverbank filtrate with drainage and with wells) and in accordance with that captured water is suitably prepared (coagulation, flocculation, tube settler, rapid sand filter, <b>active</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>filter,</b> and aeration cascades). Calculations were made for all procedures. The locations of infiltration wells and the necessary amounts of water for recharge were determined by module for particle tracking. As evidence of efficiency of active protection, results of final solution are compared with existent state.

40|$|A patient {{simulator}} {{for testing}} anaesthesia machines {{has been developed}} at Maquet Critical Care AB, to reduce costly and time-consuming experiments on animals. The device simulates human lungs regarding lung dynamics and volume, uptake of anaesthetic agents {{and the production of}} carbon dioxide, heat and moisture. Further demands on the simulator are durability and size; the device shall be compact enough to be moveable. The resulting simulator fulfils the requirements and enables better repeatability and ability to test extreme cases than experiments on animals do. Uptake of the anaesthetic agent is achieved in a <b>active</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>filter</b> and controlled by regulating the flow. The flow is created by a regenerative blower and controlled using a proportional valve. The uptake can be set by the user or by a simple uptake model modified to recursively handle changes in the concentration of anaesthetic agent. Carbon dioxide is fed into the system from a tank by a mass flow regulator. The supply of carbon dioxide can be set according to a constant flow to simulate a certain production rate, or to achieve a desired concentration of carbon dioxide in the exhaled gas. Heat and moisture is added to the exhaled gas in a chamber partially filled with water. The chamber is heated by self-regulating heating elements and supervised by a combined temperature and humidity sensor. Control and monitoring of the system is implemented in LabView and includes data processing, user interface and communication with sensors, actuators and data acquisition devices. When verifying the functionality of the simulator, tests show the exhaled gas is saturated with moisture and has a temperature sufficiently close to normal body temperature. The deviation of the calculated uptake compared to the measured value is within the requirements for larger flows through the filter. When performing tests with extremely small flows, the performance deteriorates due to limited precision of the flow measurement. Thus, if better performance is desired when simulating small uptakes, improved flow sensing accuracy is recommended...|$|E

It is then easy to realize that, if the wave speed is much smaller than the advection velocity in the filter (as it happens in usual cases), then the travelling wave is an excellent approximation of the real profile of the pollutant concentration. The model is calibrated using laboratory experiments on a reduced scale. A linear stability analysis of the travelling waves is performed. Phenomena of diffusion–dispersion are neglected, however their effects are considered in the last sections, showing when they are really negligible and how they may influence the wave shape.

In-situ real-time measurements were taken using an optical particle counter. The filtration characteristics of filter media, including single-pass efficiency, volume and effectiveness, were evaluated and analyzed. The electret filter (EE) medium shows better initial removal efficiency than the high efficiency (HE) medium in the 0. 3 – 3. 5 μm particle size range, while under the same face velocity, the filtration resistance of the HE medium is several times higher than that of the EE medium. During service life testing, the efficiency of the EE medium decreased to 60 % with a total purifying air flow of 25 × 104 m 3 /m 2. The resistance curve rose slightly before the efficiency reached the bottom, and then increased almost exponentially. The single-pass efficiency of portable air cleaner (PAC) with the pre-filter (PR) or the <b>active</b> <b>carbon</b> granule <b>filter</b> (CF) was relatively poor. While PAC with the pre-filter and the high efficiency filter (PR&HE) showed maximum single-pass efficiency for PM 1. 0 (88. 6 %), PAC with the HE was the most effective at removing PM 1. 0. The enhancement of PR with HE and electret filters augmented the single-pass efficiency, but lessened the airflow rate and effectiveness. Combined with PR, the decay constant of large-sized particles could be greater than for PACs without PR. Without regard to the lifetime, the electret filters performed better with respect to resource saving and purification improvement.
