25|$|One {{question}} that remains unanswered {{is how the}} eventual running time of just over 17 seconds was arrived at. Per the curatorial reports, the 35-mm prints have a standard 16 frames per foot of film— plus 14 frames thus equals a total of 638 frames. Murch describes the film as having been shot at 40 frames per second (fps); Loughney describes it as 46 fps. At 40 fps, 638 frames would run 15.95 seconds, which should be the maximum length of the restored film if all other reports are correct; as Loughney notes, at 46 fps, the film would last 13.86 seconds. If the latter figure is correct, as many as 9 seconds of film are missing from both extant prints if the entire violin performance was filmed. On {{the basis of his}} own tests of eighteen Kinetoscope films, scholar Gordon Hendricks argued that no Kinetoscope films were shot at 46 fps, making the speed of 40 fps reported by Murch more likely. Yet there is still a difference of more than a second between the maximum potential running time at that speed and the <b>actual</b> <b>duration</b> of the film as digitized by Murch. That 17-second running time works out to an average camera speed of approximately 37.5 fps, a significant difference from Murch's report.|$|E

30|$|Phase I {{analysis}} aims at {{constructing the}} control limits {{used in the}} ex ante control chart. Hence, it is started with {{the selection of a}} logical endpoint for the project activities via the critical path method algorithm as a planned duration. Once the baseline schedule is created, we need to define the limits between which the fictitious <b>actual</b> <b>durations</b> should be generated. The idea behind these limits arises from the fact that activity durations are usually subject to some risks which should be identified and considered in advance. In addition, incomplete knowledge of the way the project is progressed may lead to some uncertainty in the activity durations which needs to be noticed before they occur. The fictitious <b>actual</b> <b>durations</b> in this phase are generated within limits specified by the phase I parameter δ_I = { 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 }. δ_I determines the distance between which a fictitious activity duration can be generated around its nominal duration. This allows us to consider different degrees of uncertainties for our experiments. For the sake of simplicity, in this paper we have opted to generate durations from the uniform distribution; however, in practice, any other distributions may be used. Monte Carlo simulations are now used to construct the control limits of the ex ante control chart from nrs simulation runs.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Resource {{planning}} {{is essential for}} successful transport of the mechanically ven-tilated patient. Mechanically ventilated patients require adequate oxygen supplies to ensure trans-port is completed without incident. The LTV- 1000 portable ventilator utilizes a program to calcu-late oxygen cylinder duration, based on cylinder size, fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO 2), and current minute ventilation. We evaluated {{the accuracy of the}} cylinder-duration algorithm in a laboratory setting. METHODS: The LTV- 1000 was attached to a test lung. Lung compliance was set at 0. 04 L/cm H 2 O, and airway resistance was 5. 0 cm H 2 O/L/s. We tested 7 different combinations of ventilator settings a minimum of 2 times each. With each setting, minute ventilation was kept at 10 L/min. Breath type, positive end-expiratory pressure, and FIO 2 were varied to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm across a range of clinical scenarios. The cylinder-duration calculation from the ventilator program and manual calculation was determined at each setting and compared to the <b>actual</b> cylinder <b>duration.</b> RESULTS: The ventilator algorithm and the manual calculation underestimated the <b>actual</b> cylinder <b>duration</b> by 12 3 % with each test. The range of differences between calculated and <b>actual</b> cylinder <b>duration</b> was 2 – 26 min across the 7 conditions. CONCLU-SION: <b>Actual</b> cylinder <b>duration</b> averaged 12 % longer than the cylinder duration estimated by the algorithm of the LTV- 1000. One explanation is that the E cylinders may contain more liters of oxygen than indicated by the sticker {{on the side of the}} tank. Additionally, the bias flow during expiration is affected by inspiratory-expiratory ratio and respiratory rate. Clinicians should be aware of these differences when planning for patient transport.

The adults of Ardea caerulea are blue, and the young white; and white, mottled, and mature blue birds may all be seen breeding together (vol. iv. p. 58): but Mr. Blyth informs me that certain herons apparently are dimorphic, for white and coloured individuals of the same age may be observed. The Harlequin duck (Anas histrionica, Linn.) takes three years to acquire its full plumage, though many birds breed in the second year (vol. iii. p. 614).

6000|$|We are to understand, however, (for {{sometimes}} so {{the author}} hints,) that something stable in the Constitution of Regicide {{was required for}} our amity with it; but the noble Remarker is no more solicitous about this point than he is for the permanence of the whole body of his October speculations. [...] "If," [...] says he, speaking of the Regicide, [...] "they can obtain a practicable constitution, even for a limited period of time, {{they will be in}} a condition to reestablish the accustomed relations of peace and amity." [...] Pray let us leave this bush-fighting. What is meant by a limited period of time? Does it mean the direct contrary to the terms, an unlimited period? If it is a limited period, what limitation does he fix as a ground for his opinion? Otherwise, his limitation is unlimited. If he only requires a constitution that will last while the treaty goes on, ten days' existence will satisfy his demands. He knows that France never did want a practicable constitution, nor a government, which endured for a limited period of time. Her constitutions were but too practicable; and short as was their duration, it was but too long. They endured time enough for treaties which benefited themselves and have done infinite mischief to our cause. But, granting him his strange thesis, that hitherto the mere form or the mere term of their constitutions, and not their indisposition, but their instability, has been the cause of their not preserving the relations of amity,--how could a constitution which might not last half an hour after the noble lord's signature of the treaty, in the company in which he must sign it, insure its observance? If you trouble yourself at all with their constitutions, you are certainly more concerned with them after the treaty than before it, as the observance of conventions is of infinitely more consequence than the making them. Can anything be more palpably absurd and senseless than to object to a treaty of peace for want of durability in constitutions which had an <b>actual</b> <b>duration,</b> and to trust a constitution {{that at the time of}} the writing had not so much as a practical existence? There is no way of accounting for such discourse in the mouths of men of sense, but by supposing that they secretly entertain a hope that the very act of having made a peace with the Regicides will give a stability to the Regicide system. This will not clear the discourse from the absurdity, but it will account for the conduct, which such reasoning so ill defends. What a roundabout way is this to peace,--to make war for the destruction of regicides, and then to give them peace in order to insure a stability that will enable them to observe it! I say nothing of the honor displayed in such a system. It is plain it militates with itself almost in all the parts of it. In one part, it supposes stability in their Constitution, as a ground of a stable peace; in another part, we are to hope for peace in a different way,--that is, by splitting this brilliant orb into little stars, and this would make the face of heaven so fine! No, there is no system upon which the peace which in humility we are to supplicate can possibly stand.|$|E

40|$|Construction {{time has}} been {{acknowledged}} by construction researchers and industry practitioners {{over the past three}} decades as one of the most important performance criteria of many successful projects. This raises an increasing global concern about benchmarking best practice measures of construction time performance (CTP) for use by clients, consultants and contractors in the construction industry. Previously derived statistical time models were first reviewed in this paper. A questionnaire survey was then undertaken to identify a set of critical factors influencing construction durations of high-rise public housing projects in Hong Kong. Data were gleaned from a representative sample of 56 standard 'Harmony'-type residential blocks via mailed standard questionnaires. Multiple regression exercises were performed to analyse the project data and establish a prediction model. The results suggested that the overall construction duration of such projects could be modelled on the basis of a set of scope factors, construction method and housing scheme chosen. Predicted durations calculated from the developed model were then compared and assessed against <b>actual</b> <b>durations</b> achieved on-site. The concept of CTP index, which represents the predicted durations of individual projects relative to their <b>actual</b> observed <b>durations,</b> was applied as a useful means for evaluating and benchmarking their CTP. Practical applications of the developed model were also explained. Another construction time prediction model is envisaged to be formulated for private sector housing blocks in Hong Kong for local and international comparisons.
