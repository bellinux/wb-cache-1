50|$|In jazz harmony, <b>a</b> {{secondary}} <b>dominant</b> is any dominant seventh chord (major-minor seventh chord) {{which occurs}} on a weak beat and resolves downward by a perfect fifth. Thus, a chord is <b>a</b> secondary <b>dominant</b> {{when it is}} functioning as the dominant of some harmonic element other than the key's tonic, and promptly resolves to that element. This is slightly different from the traditional use of the term, where <b>a</b> secondary <b>dominant</b> {{does not have to}} be a seventh chord, occur on a weak beat, or resolve downward. If <b>a</b> non-diatonic <b>dominant</b> chord is used on a strong beat, it is considered <b>an</b> extended <b>dominant.</b> If it doesn't resolve downward, it may be a borrowed chord.|$|R
