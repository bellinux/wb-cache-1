2500|$|Davis made five {{starts in}} 2002. He ran the #77 Docutech/Gestetner Ford {{in his first}} 2002 race at Richmond, and had the best weekend of his career at the time with a 29th place start and 26th-place finish. For {{the rest of the}} season, Davis only drove the #0 Chevrolet for his father's race team, Davis Motorsports. In four starts, his best finish was a 24th at Memphis Motorsports Park. Davis did not race at all in 2003, due to his USAR commitments, [...] but he played a large role as Davis Motorsports began to run {{full-time}} in the series. He worked in the shop <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> on the pit box, as the team made its first full season.|$|E

60|$|<b>And</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the car {{swung her}} against him. And {{they waited for}} the motion to bring them together. Yet they stared out of the windows, mute.|$|E
60|$|Harry {{proceeded}} to obey, Raeburn watching him, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> again his greed rekindled by some bright scintillation, abstracting another jewel from the secretary's share, and adding {{it to his}} own.|$|R
50|$|The monthly Low End Theory Podcast {{began in}} 2009 and {{features}} mixes from a resident DJ and one guest DJ. Since its inception, Low End Theory {{has expanded to}} Japan, San Francisco, New York City, and Europe, performing quarterly in Japan <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> again in the latter three.|$|R
60|$|Presently, {{after a long}} time, I {{perceived}} he was asleep. His breath {{came with}} peculiar wheezings, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> again he would cough. I was very stiff and tired myself, and perhaps I dozed. I don't remember. I remember only sitting, as it seemed, nigh interminably, beside him, too weary even to think in that sandy desolation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm not {{his only}} ideal," [...] March protested. [...] "He adores Kenby too, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> he {{brings me to}} book with a text from Kenby's gospel." ...|$|E
60|$|Old Sam put his 'ead {{under the}} bedclothes and laughed till the bed shook; <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> he'd put his 'ead {{out and look}} at Peter and Ginger and laugh agin till he choked.|$|E
6000|$|... "I dunno {{what to make}} of 'im. Looks to me for all {{the world}} like an 'alf-tame leopard." [...] <b>And</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> a Forsyte would come up, sidle round, and take a look at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{some species}} of savage {{religious}} ceremony, your Majesty. According to the admiral, the dunes by the seashore where he landed {{were covered with}} a multitude of men behaving just as this man is doing. They had sticks in their hands and they struck with these at small round objects. <b>And</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> again----" ...|$|R
60|$|I don't {{know who}} they meant, but they all laughed. <b>And</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> again I'd hear them praising the food, which I don't wonder at, for Jules had {{certainly}} done himself proud. All artistic temperament, these Frenchmen are. The moment I told him we had company, so to speak, he blossomed like a flower does {{when you put it}} in water.|$|R
6000|$|But the ape {{is still}} there, {{and always will}} be, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> again, when Constable Civilisation turns his back for a moment, as during [...] "Spanish Furies," [...] or [...] "September massacres," [...] or Western mob rule, it creeps out and bites and tears at quivering flesh, or plunges its hairy arms elbow deep in blood, or dances round a burning nigger.|$|R
60|$|It didn't sound a {{comfortable}} plan, Alice thought, {{and for a}} few minutes she walked on in silence, puzzling over the idea, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> stopping to help the poor Knight, who certainly was NOT a good rider.|$|E
60|$|Some one is with me, but I cannot see him, and we {{walk through}} the forest, pushing our way among the tangled vines that cling about our feet, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> between the giant tree-trunks, we catch glimpses of the noisy street.|$|E
6000|$|... "'As I was {{his best}} friend,' said the Miller, 'it is only fair that I should have the best place'; so he walked {{at the head of}} the {{procession}} in a long black cloak, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> he wiped his eyes with a big pocket-handkerchief.|$|E
5000|$|... "But I was by {{this time}} so weary that I could have slept twelve hours at a stretch; I had the taste of sleep in my throat; my joints slept even when my mind was waking; the hot smell of the heather, and the drone of the wild bees, were like possets to me; <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> again I would give a jump and find I had been dozing." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nod {{sat down}} again beside Thimble's litter and touched his hand. It was dry and burning hot. He heard him gabbling, gabbling on and on to himself, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> again he would start up and gaze fixedly into the night. [...] "No, Thimble, no," [...] Nod would say. [...] "Lie back, my brother.

50|$|Why {{do people}} from Gabrovo switch the lamp on <b>and</b> off <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then when they're reading a book? To save energy while turning pages.|$|R
60|$|Dunstable was a {{youth of}} ideas. He saw far more {{possibilities}} in {{the routine of}} life at Locksley than did {{the majority of his}} contemporaries, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> he made use of these possibilities in a way that caused a considerable sensation in the school.|$|E
60|$|The ladies {{were told}} all this again, to be sure, {{and they made}} {{themselves}} merry with it, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the young ladies, Mr. Mayor's daughters, would come and see me, and ask where the little gentlewoman was, which made me not a little proud of myself.|$|E
60|$|When day {{broke the}} Russians {{commenced}} firing, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> a shell would pass roaring over the men's heads. Sometimes one would drop in amongst them. When this happened the men fled right and left, or threw themselves flat {{on their faces}} until the shell had exploded.|$|E
60|$|And all {{the while}} Tom Chist sat <b>and</b> listened, <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then {{reaching}} out furtively and touching the heap of money still lying upon the coat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now," [...] thought I to myself, [...] "it {{is plain}} I must lie where I am and not disturb the balance; {{but it is}} plain also that I can put the paddle over the side {{and from time to}} time, in smooth places, give her a shove or two towards land." [...] No sooner thought upon than done. There I lay on my elbows in the most trying attitude, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> again gave a weak stroke or two to turn her head to shore.|$|R
50|$|The seungmu {{integrates}} {{the eight}} rhythmic cycles: yeombul, dodeuri, taryeong, jajin taryeong, gutgeori, dwit gutgeori, gujeong nori, <b>and</b> saesanjo. <b>Every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then, when one rhythm shifts to another, the dancer changes the mood by changing his steps.|$|R
6000|$|... "Principally at Paris, my dear aunt.

60|$|I don't {{think she}} was. I don't think she forgot anything, and she raked up things that I 'ad contradicted {{years ago and}} wot I thought was all forgot. <b>And</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> when she stopped for breath, she'd try and get round to {{the same side of}} the table I was.|$|E
60|$|The wind shifted another point; and {{now their}} lost shipmates were {{for a time}} {{forgotten}} in the anxieties of their own critical position, for their rocky ledge formed only a partial shelter, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the hut was shaken with a blast so terrible that it threatened to come down about their ears.|$|E
6000|$|Hanrahan {{had begun}} to climb the {{mountain}} then, and he gave over singing, for {{it was a long}} climb for him, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> again he had to sit down and to rest for a while. And one time he was resting he took notice of a wild briar bush, with blossoms on it, that was growing beside a rath, and it brought to mind the wild roses he used to bring to Mary Lavelle, and to no woman after her. And he tore off a little branch of the bush, that had buds on it and open blossoms, and he went on with his song: ...|$|R
25|$|Uptown Shah Alam {{is located}} in Section 24 near the LKSA highway. It is a very popular place for locals where {{it is more than}} just a flea market. There are food stalls and events such as concert <b>and</b> games <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then.|$|R
60|$|Blushing, smiling, bowing, {{constrained}} {{from the}} novelty of his situation, <b>and</b> yet <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then quite at ease when his ear recalled a familiar voice, dear Mr. Glastonbury was gratified and happy. The duke took him aside, and they were soon engaged in conversation.|$|R
60|$|Through {{the open}} window came the sound of wood {{knocking}} against wood, of exclamations of annoyance or triumph as the game proceeded, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> a ripple of prolonged laughter, girlish, fresh, pure as the fragrant air, clear as the last notes of the cuckoo before he speaks his final farewell to summer.|$|E
6000|$|General {{conversation}} followed, and {{the twins}} drifted about from group to group, talking easily and fluently and winning approval, compelling admiration and achieving favor from all. The widow followed their conquering march with a proud eye, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> Rowena said to herself with deep satisfaction, [...] "And to think they are ours--all ours!" ...|$|E
60|$|Ruth {{said nothing}} in reply; but, as Mrs Gamp, laying her chin {{against the cool}} iron of the rail, {{continued}} to look intently at the Antwerp boat, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{to give a little}} groan, she inquired whether any child of hers was going aboard that morning? Or perhaps her husband, she said kindly.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Parsons {{went up to}} her son, by whom sat the Colonel, {{looking at}} him wistfully. James lay on his back, {{breathing}} quickly, dull, listless, <b>and</b> apathetic. <b>Every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then his dark dry lips contracted as the unceasing pain of his head became suddenly almost insufferable.|$|R
60|$|I {{sat down}} beside her, and {{presently}} she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly, and peeped out by {{the corner of the}} blind. There was a full moonlight, and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled around, doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat, I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat watching her.|$|R
60|$|We {{were still}} in the mountains. The trail led down the river for a bit through the worst of canebrakes, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> again we stopped while Tom and Weldon scouted. Once the roan mare made a dash through the brake, and, though Polly Ann burst through one way to head her off and I another, we reached the bank of Richland Creek in time to see her nose and the top of her pack above the brown water. There was nothing for it but to swim after her, which I did, and caught her quietly feeding in the cane on the other side. By great good fortune the other horse bore the powder.|$|R
