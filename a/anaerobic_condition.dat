25|$|Energy {{needed to}} perform short lasting, high {{intensity}} bursts of activity {{is derived from}} anaerobic metabolism within the cytosol of muscle cells, as opposed to aerobic respiration which utilizes oxygen, is sustainable, and occurs in the mitochondria. The quick energy sources consist of the phosphocreatine (PCr) system, fast glycolysis, and adenylate kinase. All of these systems re-synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the universal energy source in all cells. The most rapid source, but the most readily depleted of the above sources is the PCr system which utilizes the enzyme creatine kinase. This enzyme catalyzes a reaction that combines phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into ATP and creatine. This resource is short lasting because oxygen {{is required for the}} resynthesis of phosphocreatine via mitochondrial creatine kinase. Therefore, under anaerobic conditions, this substrate is finite and only lasts between approximately 10 to 30 seconds of high intensity work. Fast glycolysis, however, can function for approximately 2 minutes prior to fatigue, and predominately uses intracellular glycogen as a substrate. Glycogen is broken down rapidly via glycogen phosphorylase into individual glucose units during intense exercise. Glucose is then oxidized to pyruvate and under <b>anaerobic</b> <b>condition</b> is reduced to lactic acid. This reaction oxidizes NADH to NAD, thereby releasing a hydrogen ion, promoting acidosis. For this reason, fast glycolysis can not be sustained for long periods of time. Lastly, adenylate kinase catalyzes a reaction by which 2 ADP are combined to form ATP and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). This reaction takes place during low energy situations such as extreme exercise or conditions of hypoxia, but is not a significant source of energy. The creation of AMP resulting from this reaction stimulates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP kinase) which is the energy sensor of the cell. After sensing low energy conditions, AMP kinase stimulates various other intracellular enzymes geared towards increasing energy supply and decreasing all anabolic, or energy requiring, cell functions.|$|E

Possible consequences are an increase in N2O emission, decreases in available nitrogen in soil and reduced efficiency of nitrogen usage by crops. This may cause in an increase of fertilizer use.|$|E

50|$|The rhodium-catalyzed hydroboration {{reaction}} {{is thought to}} be initiated with the dissociation of a triphenylphosphine from the Rh(I) centre. Oxidative addition of the B-H bond of the borane reagent to this 14 e− species is then followed by coordination of the alkene to the 16e− Rh(III) hydride complex. Subsequent migratory insertion of the alkene into the rhodium-hydride bond can give two regioisomeric alkyl rhodium(III) boride complexes. Reductive elimination of the boronate ester regenerates the catalyst. Catalyst prepared and handled under <b>anaerobic</b> <b>condition</b> reverses the selectivity to favor the secondary boronate ester. What has been debated is the coordination of the alkene. In the dissociative mechanism, proposed by Männig and Nöth, and supported by Evans and Fu the coordination is accompanied by the loss of one triphenylphosphine ligand.|$|E

50|$|This {{technology}} has been created in Japan. Dr. Tsushida and his collaborators at the former MAFF National Research Institute of Tea (currently the National Institute of Vegetables and Tea Science) began developing GABA-rich tea in 1984 and successfully produced a new type tea in which almost all glutamic acid has been converted to GABA without changing the content of catechin or caffeine. They discovered a new method of tea fermentation, and found that {{a large amount of}} GABA accumulated in green tea through six to ten hours in anaerobic (oxygen-free) condition of fermentation. Oxygen in the atmosphere fermentation chamber was replaced with nitrogen. They examined further the GABA content of green, oolong and black tea made under <b>anaerobic</b> <b>condition</b> and found that GABA accumulated in all teas. Japanese scientists have shown great interest and attention to this new technology and in the late 1980s in Japan, this GABA tea was actively distributed as a commercial product for people with hypertension. It was found that the chemically synthesized GABA reduces blood pressure in experimental animals and humans. Further research demonstrated that GABA tea was also able to reduce the blood pressure in experimental animals and humans.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} options to address {{biogenic}} sulfide corrosion problems: impairing H2S formation, venting out the H2S or using materials resistant to biogenic corrosion. For example, sewage flows more rapidly through steeper gradient sewers reducing time available for hydrogen sulfide generation. Likewise, removing sludge and sediments {{from the bottom}} of the pipes reduces the amount of anoxic areas responsible for sulfate reducing bacteria growth. Providing good ventilation of sewers can reduce atmospheric concentrations of hydrogen sulfide gas and may dry exposed sewer crowns, but this may create odor issues with neighbors around the venting shafts. Three other efficient methods can be used involving continuous operation of mechanical equipment: chemical reactant like calcium nitrate can be continuously added in the sewerage water to impair the H2S formation, an active ventilation through odor treatment units to remove H2S, or an injection of compressed air in pressurized mains to avoid the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>condition</b> to develop. In sewerage areas where biogenic sulfide corrosion is expected, acid resistant materials like calcium aluminate cements, PVC or vitrified clay pipe may be substituted to ordinary concrete or steel sewers. Existing structures that have extensive exposure to biogenic corrosion such as sewer manholes and pump station wet wells can be rehabilitated. Rehabilitation can be done with materials such as a structural epoxy coating, this epoxy is designed to be both acid resistant and strength the compromised concrete structure (See Raven Lining Systems).|$|E

In general, volatile production was suppressed under <b>anaerobic</b> <b>conditions</b> but resumed, to some extent, after fruits were returned to air. The effects of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>conditions</b> on individual compounds were separated into six groups based on their production trends relative to those of air conditions.

The effects of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>conditions</b> on banana flavor and off-flavor development were determined by a taste panel quality scaling method. In {{order to determine the}} difference between bananas subjected to both <b>conditions</b> (aerobic and <b>anaerobic),</b> the "difference from control" method was used in other experiments. Generally, the bananas subjected to <b>anaerobic</b> <b>conditions</b> had better physical appearance than bananas in the air control group but lacked fruit flavor and firmness.
