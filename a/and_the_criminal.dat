25|$|Although {{the coup}} failed, {{the death of}} the King and heir {{apparent}} was responsible for continuing instability which was ultimately a success for the republicans.

In fact, the acclamation policies was a rendition: many of the conspirators were liberated from prison, the assassins (who were killed in the square) were eulogized as martyrs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>criminal</b> investigation was rendered ineffective. These events only encouraged the republicans to attempt another coup d'état 33 months later, led by the same people, that would succeed in establishing the Portuguese First Republic. The events that gave rise to the attempted coup on January 28 were the last attempts to reform the constitutional monarchy.|$|E
