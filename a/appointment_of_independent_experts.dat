500|$|In 1949, that {{coalition}} {{scored a}} victory in the election for [...] "row offices" [...] (minor citywide offices including treasurer, coroner, and controller), and the reformers used their new platforms to expose corruption in city government. A bipartisan commission of reformers proposed a new city charter in 1950. The new scheme would shift power away from city council to a strong mayor, something they believed would produce a system that would be more efficient and less susceptible to corruption. It also included provisions for civil service reform, requiring that city jobs be filled by merit selection rather than patronage. The higher-ranking executive branch positions in city government would almost all be filled by the mayor directly without council approval, which was intended to encourage the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>independent</b> <b>experts</b> instead of distributing jobs as reward for political service. Voters approved the charter overwhelmingly in an April 1951 referendum, setting up a showdown in November for election to the revised city government.|$|E
40|$|The audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Australian Securities and Investments Commission’s administration of enforceable undertakings. Audit objective and criteria The objective of the audit was to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} Australian Securities and Investments Commission’s administration of enforceable undertakings. To form a conclusion against this objective, the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) adopted the following high level criteria: 	management arrangements are in place that support the effective, consistent and transparent administration of EUs; 	offers of an EU are administered consistently, transparently and in accordance with ASIC 2 ̆ 7 s policies and procedures; and 	EUs accepted by ASIC are monitored to ensure compliance with those undertakings, action is undertaken where non‑compliance is identified and the effectiveness of EUs as a regulatory tool is assessed. Overall conclusion As one of ASIC’s suite of regulatory responses, enforceable undertakings (EUs) have a valuable role in ASIC’s overall enforcement approach. EUs are particularly useful in addressing less serious misconduct where the promisor is co-operative. A potential benefit of EUs is in driving changes in a promisor’s compliance culture and systems, whereas an administrative penalty (or even a civil sanction) may not lead to behavioural change. Since their introduction in 1998, ASIC has accepted an average of 24 EUs per year, and from January 2012 to June 2014, 53 of ASIC’s 1711 enforcement actions (three per cent) were EUs. In general, ASIC has effectively administered the EUs it has negotiated and accepted. It has sound processes for each major step of the EU process: accepting EUs as the most appropriate regulatory tool; including terms in the undertaking that appropriately address the misconduct; and monitoring adherence to those terms and addressing any identified non‑compliance. However, there is considerable scope to improve the record keeping processes supporting EU decisions and compliance monitoring, as documentation was inconsistent, dispersed across multiple systems and not always readily available. In addition, ASIC does not measure or report on the effectiveness of EUs in achieving intended regulatory outcomes, including greater levels of voluntary compliance. Improved performance measurement and reporting would better inform key stakeholders, including Parliament, of the effectiveness of ASIC’s regulation. In relation to entering into EUs, ASIC has accepted offers of EUs consistently, transparently and in accordance with its policies and procedures. For most EUs reviewed by the ANAO (83  per cent), there was sufficient documentation to demonstrate that accepting an EU would provide an effective regulatory outcome and no instances were identified where promisors were treated differently based on the size of their business. ASIC also had a sound basis for including particular terms in each EU, with the terms generally aligning with the non‑compliance at which the EU was directed. However, ASIC could ensure that EUs are clearer about the misconduct that was the subject of ASIC’s concerns. ASIC could also strengthen its capacity to assess compliance with, and the effectiveness of, EUs by more consistently including in the terms of an EU the requirement that the promisor report back to ASIC demonstrating their compliance with EU obligations. This information will better inform ASIC’s monitoring of the promisor’s compliance with the EU and, where necessary, its response to non‑compliance. Where the EU required an independent expert to assess the promisor’s compliance with EU obligations, ASIC was generally involved with the review process, and the reports provided by the expert were satisfactory. However, there were inconsistencies in ASIC’s approach to approving the appointment of experts and their terms of reference. In February 2015, ASIC released new public guidance that is expected to help improve processes relating to the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>independent</b> <b>experts.</b> The ANAO has made two recommendations aimed at improving ASIC’s measurement and reporting of the effectiveness of EUs, and its documentation of key decisions relating to EUs...|$|E

40|$|A {{challenge}} is posed {{to the institution}} of international adjudication by international disputes concerning physical risks to human beings and the environment. These cases are requiring international tribunals to exercise their powers of adjudication in circumstances of scientific uncertainty. This thesis posits that, by dint of the development and clarification {{of the law and}} through the revisitation of rules about proof, international adjudication is developing the capacity to deal with such international disputes. A growing emphasis on the importance of international procedural obligations, the harmonisation of international law, and a broadening acceptance of precautionary doctrines in substantive law help shape the legal issues coming before tribunals in disputes involving scientific uncertainty into more manageable form. International courts and tribunals are meanwhile attending to the problems that may be posed by the concept of a burden of proof in disputes involving scientific uncertainty. A move towards a more inquisitorial style of adjudication, relying on tribunals’ <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>independent</b> <b>expert</b> advisors, provides relief from pressures associated with the application of traditional rules on proof in such cases. At the same time, tribunals’ adjudicatory competence in such disputes is gradually being defined, using criteria by which respondents’ activities may practically be assessed, such as rationality and reasonableness.

We focus on the factors that strengthen <b>independent</b> directors’ performance <b>of</b> fiduciary duties notably the presence <b>of</b> <b>independent</b> financial <b>expert,</b> senior <b>independent</b> director, independent board’s chairman, and absence of top management executives and presence of family members {{on the board of directors}}. We conduct our research using 221 samples of Malaysian listed companies. This study extends prior research by emphasizing the significance <b>of</b> regulating the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>independent</b> financial <b>expert</b> and the support <b>of</b> <b>independent</b> director with in depth corporate governance experience on the board. The results show that board oversight roles enhanced firm performance when a senior independent director and an independent board’s chairman were present on the board where CEO, CFO, COO or MD was not a board member. Furthermore, the negative relationship between the proportion of family member director on the board and firm performance supported the imperativeness <b>of</b> higher <b>independent</b> director presence on the board. These findings provide empirical evidence in support of the significance of board independence as an effective governing mechanism for monitoring family-member director influence on board decisions. On the other hand, the negative relationship between the presence of more than majority independent director on the board and firm performance signifies their productivity is valued more than numbers...|$|R
40|$|Water is the world's {{third largest}} {{industry}} after oil and energy power. Although clean {{drinking water and}} sanitation are necessary for the health and development of individuals and communities, even today, billions of people lack access to either. In response to these concerns, {{the international community has}} set a Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of providing, by 2015, clean water and improved sanitation to {{at least half of the}} people worldwide who now lack these services. Water is treated both as a public good and an economic good. In the last decade, we have witnessed the commoditisation through privatization and liberalisation of an essential good for each individual's life. Transnational corporations may encounter water issues in at least three different contexts: a) as enablers of access to water; b) as providers or distributors of water and c) as a user or consumer of water. Many initiatives have been developed within the United Nations such as the Global Compact and the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> both an <b>independent</b> <b>expert</b> on human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation and a Special Representative of the Secretary General on business and human rights. Both of them are mainstreaming human rights in the business sector reconciling different forms of regulations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to examine the}} impact of the {{adoption}} of the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance 2001 and Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (presently known as Malaysia Bourse) Listing Rulings 2001 by 221 listed Main and Second Board firms of the Bourse on their firm performance. To fulfil this objective, the study hypothesised the relationship between the firms' board of directors' and its sub-committees' (i. e. audit committee, nomination committee and remuneration committee) composition, structure and competency on firm performance. The study findings indicated that the presence <b>of</b> an <b>independent</b> director with corporate governance experience (i. e. a senior independent director) {{on the board of directors}} and its subcommittees had a positive impact on firm performance. Specifically, when domineering executive directors and family-member director(s) were present on the board and its subcommittees, the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> senior <b>independent</b> director safeguarded and strengthened the quality of independence, credibility, and influence <b>of</b> <b>independent</b> directors' views and decisions. Moreover, the board of directors that was led by an independent director, non-executive director or founder, and that had a separate chairman and CEO position established appropriate control and monitoring of authorization of power on the organisational process and board members conducts. Further, the presence of a high proportion <b>of</b> <b>independent</b> directors on the board and its sub committees was important to monitor family-member director and CEO, CFO and/or managing director influence on the board's and its sub-committees decisions. The study also found, the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> an <b>independent</b> financial <b>expert,</b> namely someone with practising accountant experience on the audit committee to be crucial given that some companies had the tendency to appoint the CEO, CFO, managing director and/or family-member director with a financial background to fulfil the position. In addition, directors with industry knowledge and experience were substantial in enhancing board entrepreneurship skills, strategic investment planning and improving the overall decision making process. The study further revealed that foreign directors and institutional investors that were active in monitoring of firm activities vital for shareholder value creation. The findings of the thesis make several important contributions to the corporate governance literature in identifying the impact of family-member directors' membership of audit, nomination and remuneration committees on such committees' effectiveness. Further, the empirical evidence gathered will assist the policy-makers in evaluating and improving current corporate governance ruling for better protection of investors' interests and greater commitment of corporations to practise responsible corporate governance conduct...|$|R

This recommendation was supported by four observations: the size and cumbersome nature of the CAP budget has made the development of other activities difficult, without reining in agricultural expenditures; the CAP is now more about distributing resources to a specific group rather than an allocative policy promoting efficiency and production; enlargement will make a single policy less and less appropriate; the current CAP is incompatible with the Lisbon goals of ensuring value for money, growth and convergence in EU economies.
