5|$|In {{embryonic}} development, {{the lungs}} {{begin to develop}} as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form {{the upper part of}} the digestive system. When the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-filled <b>amniotic</b> <b>sac</b> and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. At birth however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity {{is one of}} the dilemmas of sheep breeding. In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs. After the birth, ewes ideally break the <b>amniotic</b> <b>sac</b> (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth. In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.|$|E

STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-eight rabbits {{with a total}} of 313 <b>amniotic</b> <b>sacs</b> were used for this study. In each animal a 1 cm hysteroamniotomy was made in two <b>amniotic</b> <b>sacs</b> at 22 days' gestation (term = 32). For 12 <b>amniotic</b> <b>sacs</b> (group 1) only the myometrium was closed by microsurgical suturing. In group 2 (n = 12), sutures included myometrium and membranes. In group 3 (n = 8), a collagen plug was placed, and in group 4 (n = 12) fibrin glue was used. Twelve sacs were left unclosed (positive controls) and the unmanipulated 257 sacs were negative controls. Eight days later (gestational age 30 days) <b>amniotic</b> <b>sacs</b> were evaluated for the presence of amniotic fluid, membrane integrity, and fetal weight and survival. Statistics were done with two-tailed Fisher's exact test and one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: Membrane integrity (p = 0. 0036) and amniotic fluid (p = 0. 047) were best restored after myometrial closure. Fetal weight and survival rate were not affected by different closure techniques. CONCLUSION: In this model primary closure of the myometrium only yielded best results. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore a}} {{surgical}} plug formed from decellularized term human amnion membrane for fetoscopic closure of iatrogenic defects in fetal membranes in a rabbit model. METHODS: The study {{was performed in}} eight rabbit does. Punctures were created at midgestational day 23 by 14 -gauge needle fetoscopy on surgically exposed rabbit <b>amniotic</b> <b>sacs.</b> The entry sites were fetoscopically plugged either with decellularized term human amnion membrane (n= 10) or previously successful commercial collagen matrix foil (n= 10), followed by their primary fixation with fibrin glue and myometrial suturing. Seven punctured sacs without any plugging and 31 sacs without any manipulation served as two reference groups. Amniotic integrity and fetal parameters were assessed at gestational day 30. RESULTS: We established a facile method to prepare sheets of decellularized term human amnion membrane and verified its nontoxicity and cell compatibility in vitro. Decellularized term human amnion membrane sheets could be delivered precisely and controlled by fetoscopy as compact plugs into amniotic defects. The surgical handling characteristics of decellularized term human amnion membrane were better than the commercial collagen matrix foil. Treatment with human decellularized term human amnion membrane was comparable to treatment with the collagen matrix with regard to efficiency in restoring amniotic integrity. Seventy-five percent and 71. 4 % of <b>amniotic</b> <b>sacs</b> treated with decellularized term human amnion membrane or the commercial collagen matrix foil, respectively, showed amniotic integrity, compared with 25 % in the left-open study group.

25|$|Prenatal diagnosis: Used {{to detect}} {{changes in a}} fetus's genes or {{chromosomes}} before birth. This type of testing is offered to couples with {{an increased risk of}} having a baby with a genetic or chromosomal disorder. In some cases, prenatal testing can lessen a couple's uncertainty or help them decide whether to abort the pregnancy. It cannot identify all possible inherited disorders and birth defects, however. One method of performing a prenatal genetic test involves an amniocentesis, which removes a sample of fluid from the mother’s <b>amniotic</b> <b>sac</b> 15 to 20 or more weeks into pregnancy. The fluid is then tested for chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) and Trisomy 18, which can result in neonatal or fetal death. Test results can be retrieved within 7–14 days after the test is done. This method is 99.4% accurate at detecting and diagnosing fetal chromosome abnormalities. Although there is a risk of miscarriage associated with an amniocentesis, the miscarriage rate is only 1/400. Another method of prenatal testing is Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS). Chorionic villi are projections from the placenta that carry the same genetic makeup as the baby. During this method of prenatal testing, a sample of chorionic villi is removed from the placenta to be tested. This test is performed 10–13 weeks into pregnancy and results are ready 7–14 days after the test was done. Another test using blood taken from the fetal umbilical cord is percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling.|$|E
25|$|Most {{reptiles}} lay amniotic eggs {{covered with}} leathery or calcareous shells. An amnion, chorion, and allantois are present during embryonic life. The eggshell (1) protects the crocodile embryo (11) and keeps it from drying out, {{but it is}} flexible to allow gas exchange. The chorion (6) aids in gas exchange between the {{inside and outside of}} the egg. It allows carbon dioxide to exit the egg and oxygen gas to enter the egg. The albumin (9) further protects the embryo and serves as a reservoir for water and protein. The allantois (8) is a sac that collects the metabolic waste produced by the embryo. The <b>amniotic</b> <b>sac</b> (10) contains amniotic fluid (12) which protects and cushions the embryo. The amnion (5) aids in osmoregulation and serves as a saltwater reservoir. The yolk sac (2) surrounding the yolk (3) contains protein and fat rich nutrients that are absorbed by the embryo via vessels (4) that allow the embryo to grow and metabolize. The air space (7) provides the embryo with oxygen while it is hatching. This ensures that the embryo will not suffocate while it is hatching. There are no larval stages of development. Viviparity and ovoviviparity have evolved in many extinct clades of reptiles and in squamates. In the latter group, many species, including all boas and most vipers, utilize this mode of reproduction. The degree of viviparity varies; some species simply retain the eggs until just before hatching, others provide maternal nourishment to supplement the yolk, and yet others lack any yolk and provide all nutrients via a structure similar to the mammalian placenta. The earliest documented case of viviparity in reptiles is the Early Permian mesosaurs, although some individuals or taxa in that clade may also have been oviparous because a putative isolated egg has also been found. Several groups of Mesozoic marine reptiles also exhibited viviparity, such as mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, and Sauropterygia, a group that include pachypleurosaurs and Plesiosauria.|$|E
40|$|The Antenatal Genetic Testing Program at MCV {{began in}} 1973.

After referral, patients are given genetic counseling by me and members of the Department of Human Genetics; if antenatal genetic testing is deemed appropriate, we obtain informed consent and proceed with an ultrasound study.

40|$|The {{presence}} of polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios is pathognomonic for twin–twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). However, polyhydramnios of both twins can exist in TTTS {{in the setting}} of a septostomy of the dividing membrane. In prior reported cases of dual polyhydramnios TTTS, the septostomy was identified through either ultrasound or fetoscopy thus helping to establish the diagnosis of TTTS with an unusual presentation. The presented case is a set of monochorionic, diamniotic twins who presented initially with dual polyhydramnios. Subsequent ultrasound and clinical and pathologic findings were otherwise consistent with TTTS. Unlike prior reported cases, a septostomy of the dividing membrane was never identified with ultrasound or even on post delivery placental examination. However, microseptostomies were demonstrated due to the transfer of indigo carmine between the <b>amniotic</b> <b>sacs</b> at amniocentesis. Thus {{in the setting of}} TTTS concern, the diagnosis should be considered with dual polyhydramnios even if a septostomy cannot be identified...|$|R
40|$|Intraamniotic {{infection}} {{is associated with}} increased IL- 1 activity in amniotic fluid, increased incidence of preterm labor, and with decreased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in infants born prematurely. We hypothesized that an elevated IL- 1 in amniotic fluid promotes fetal lung maturation. On day 23 or 25 of gestation (term 31 d), either IL- 1 alpha (150 or 1, 500 ng per fetus) or its antagonist IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 ra, 20 microg) was injected to the <b>amniotic</b> fluid <b>sacs</b> in one uterine horn, whereas the contralateral <b>amniotic</b> <b>sacs</b> were injected with vehicle. Within 40 h, IL- 1 alpha caused a dose-dependent increase in surfactant protein-A (SP-A) and SP-B mRNAs (maximally, fivefold), without affecting lung growth or increasing inflammatory cells in the lung. Both genders, and upper and lower lung lobes were similarly affected. IL- 1 ra did not modify SP-A, -B, or -C mRNA. IL- 1 increased the intensity of staining of alveolar type II cells for SP-B, and the concentrations of SP-B, -A, and disaturated phosphatidylcholine in bronchoalveolar lavage. The dynamic lung compliance and the postventilatory expansion of lungs were increased two- to fourfold after IL- 1 alpha treatment. In fetal lung explants, IL- 1 alpha increased the expression of SP-A mRNA.

A 37 year-old woman who delivered a healthy singleton after IVF returned two years later for FET, and a single blastocyst was transferred.

In a cross-sectional clinical study, AF telomere fragment concentrations quantitated by a validated real-time PCR assay were higher in women in labor at term compared to those not in labor. In vitro treatment of primary human amnion epithelial cells with 40 μM T-oligos ([TTAGGG] 2) that mimic telomere frag-ments, activated p 38 MAPK, produced senescence-associated (SA) β-gal staining and increased interleukin (IL) - 6 and IL- 8 production compared to cells treated with complemen-tary DNA sequences (Cont-oligos, [AATCCC] 2).

2500|$|The {{failure of}} the metanephros to develop in cases of BRA and some cases {{involving}} unilateral renal agenesis (URA) is due primarily to the {{failure of the}} mesonephric duct to produce a ureteric bud capable of inducing the metanephric mesenchyme. The failed induction will thereby cause the subsequent degeneration of the metanephros by apoptosis and other mechanisms. The mesonephric duct(s) of the agenic kidney(s) will also degenerate and fail to connect with the bladder. Therefore, the means by which the fetus produces urine and transports it to the bladder for excretion into the <b>amniotic</b> <b>sac</b> has been severely compromised (in the cases of URA), or completely eliminated (in the cases of BRA). The decreased volume of amniotic fluid causes the growing fetus to become compressed by the mother's uterus.

Escherichia coli ETX or saline (SA) was injected into <b>amniotic</b> <b>sacs</b> in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats at 20 days of gestation. Pups were delivered 2 days later and raised in room air (RA) or moderate hyperoxia (O 2, 80 % O 2 at Denver's altitude, ∼ 65 % O 2 at sea level) from birth through 14 days of age. Heart and lung tissues were harvested for measurements. Intra-amniotic ETX caused right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and decreased lung vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor- 2 (VEGFR- 2) protein contents at birth. In ETX-exposed rats (ETX-RA), alveolarization and vessel density were decreased, pulmonary vascular wall thickness percentage was increased, and RVH was persistent throughout the study period compared with controls (SA-RA). After antenatal ETX, moderate hyperoxia increased lung VEGF and VEGFR- 2 protein contents in ETX-O 2 rats and improved their alveolar and vascular structure and RVH compared with ETX-RA rats. In contrast, severe hyperoxia (≥ 95 % O 2 at Denver's altitude) further reduced lung vessel density after intra-amniotic ETX exposure. We conclude that intra-amniotic ETX induces fetal pulmonary hypertension and causes persistent abnormalities of lung structure with sustained pulmonary hypertension in infant rats.
