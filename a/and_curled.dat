5|$|A {{strain of}} truly domesticated red foxes was {{introduced}} by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, <b>and</b> <b>curled</b> tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.|$|E
5|$|Celtic {{went into}} the first leg in Glasgow as massive underdogs, and the match {{seemed to be going}} as {{expected}} when 17 year old Michael Owen put the English side ahead on 6 minutes. Celtic continued to struggle during the opening 20 minutes, but began to find form as the first half progressed. The start of the second half saw Celtic pushing forward more and they equalised on 53 minutes. Jackie McNamara raced down the right wing, played a one-two with Craig Burley, then volleyed a powerful shot past David James. Simon Donnelly hit the post on 62 minutes, then a minute later the referee ignored {{what appeared to be a}} blatant foul on him in the penalty box. Celtic continued to press forward, and on 73 minutes were awarded a penalty when Larsson fell on being challenged by David James in the penalty box. Donnelly converted the resultant spot kick to put Celtic ahead. With full-time approaching, Steve McManaman picked the ball from inside his own half, dribbled 70 yards to the edge of the Celtic penalty box <b>and</b> <b>curled</b> a shot in to level the match at 22. The return match at Anfield produced fewer chances and no goals, seeing Liverpool knock out Celtic on away goals.|$|E

25|$|In endospermic seeds, {{there are}} two {{distinct}} regions inside the seed coat, an upper and larger endosperm and a lower smaller embryo. The embryo is the fertilised ovule, an immature plant from which a new plant will grow under proper conditions. The embryo has one cotyledon or seed leaf in monocotyledons, two cotyledons in almost all dicotyledons and two or more in gymnosperms. In the fruit of grains (caryopses) the single monocotyledon is shield shaped and hence called a scutellum. The scutellum is pressed closely against the endosperm from which it absorbs food, and passes it to the growing parts. Embryo descriptors include small, straight, bent, curved <b>and</b> <b>curled.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the month}} of April, D.C. United went undefeated in their five league matches, winning thrice and drawing twice. The month opened with a regular season match at home to the Seattle Sounders FC. The fixture against Seattle ended in a {{scoreless}} draw, the club's second of the season, with United's Maicon Santos and Dejan Jakovic picking up yellow cards during the match. On April 14, United traveled northbound to take on Eastern Conference rivals, the New England Revolution at Gillette Stadium. After New England's José Moreno Mora opened up the scoresheet in the sixth minute, United equalized from a goal from Santos in the 19th minute. With nine minutes remaining, United's Chris Pontius received a pass from Emiliano Dudar <b>and</b> <b>curled</b> a shot around New England's Matt Reis, giving United a 2–1 lead and subsequent victory. The win marked the club's first victory at New England since August 5, 2007; when United earned a 3–0 victory at New England.|$|E
25|$|On 13 March, {{the first}} leg at Aggborough ended 51 to Stevenage. Borough took the lead half way into the first half when David Bridges latched onto a Michael Bostwick cross. Kidderminster {{equalised}} shortly after through defender Gavin Caines who drove the ball home {{from the edge of}} the area. However, it was not level for long, Mitchell Cole beat his full-back for pace and squared the ball to Yemi Odubade, who bundled the ball home. It was three before the interval; Bridges scoring again, heading in a perfectly weighted Joel Byrom cross. Chris Beardsley scored a second half brace to ensure a four-goal cushion for the Hertfordshire side going into the second leg at Broadhall Way. His first came when he met an Andy Drury delivery; his initial effort cannoned off the crossbar, but he was on hand to head in the rebound. His second came when he dispossessed Martin Riley on the touchline, cut in <b>and</b> <b>curled</b> the ball into the corner of the net. The second leg took place a week later at Broadhall Way, which ended 00 - ultimately meaning Stevenage progressed to the final at Wembley Stadium after winning 51 on aggregate over the two legs.|$|E

500|$|September saw Arsenal win all {{of their}} league matches. At home to Aston Villa, Šuker scored his first goals for the club and earnt the praise of his manager Wenger: [...] "He is just obsessed by goals. You feel when he is inside the box he hits the target." [...] Away to Southampton, {{it was the other}} signing Henry who scored his first goal for Arsenal. The player, on as a substitute, {{received}} the ball from Tony Adams and with his back to goal [...] "some 20 yards out", turned <b>and</b> <b>curled</b> it past goalkeeper Paul Jones. Henry later admitted his failure to score for Arsenal before then was getting him down: [...] "My goal today was very important for me. I have missed at least 14 or 15 chances for Arsenal and my confidence was low." [...] Kanu scored the only goal of the match against Watford, which moved Arsenal in third position, two points behind leaders Manchester United.|$|E
500|$|United {{created the}} first {{significant}} opportunity of the game, around the midway point of the first half, when a header from Steve Bruce was inadvertently cleared by his own teammate McClair in the Arsenal goal. In the meantime, Arsenal manager George Graham spotted that the marking in midfield was poor and instructed Limpar and Rocastle to push forward, while striker Paul Merson was given a deeper role to follow Mike Phelan. Arsenal took the lead two minutes before half-time; Limpar made a run across United's penalty area to receive Paul Davis' corner from the right hand side. United [...] "clearly believed this was a dummy run", hence why Phelan {{made no attempt to}} challenge. Davis passed the ball short to Limpar, who turned <b>and</b> <b>curled</b> it goalwards into the penalty area with his left foot. Although goalkeeper Les Sealey [...] "did well {{to get down to the}} ball", he was unable to hold it; referee Keith Hackett deemed the ball to have crossed the goal line and gave the goal. Ferguson offered no complaints about Hackett's decision afterwards: [...] "The video showed quite clearly the referee was right and the ball crossed the line." ...|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{created their}} first chance inside 24 seconds, when Ljungberg put Henry clear down the {{right-hand}} side. The striker used his pace {{to get the}} better of Lundekvam, only to have his shot blocked by goalkeeper Antti Niemi. Bergkamp's goal effort in the eighth minute was cleared off the line by full back Chris Baird, after Niemi fumbled Henry's initial shot. Southampton fashioned their first opportunity in the 15th minute through a high cross; in spite of unsettling the Arsenal defence, the unmarked Svensson volleyed over the bar. Baird moments after won the ball in midfield <b>and</b> <b>curled</b> a shot that left Seaman [...] "scrambling across his goal to save". Seven minutes before the break, Arsenal went into the lead. Henry, receiving the ball from Parlour, slipped it into Bergkamp down the right. He in turn fed the ball to Ljungberg, whose shot was blocked. The ball rebounded in the direction of Pirès, who needed one touch to set himself and another to fire at the near post, despite Niemi getting a hand. Arsenal missed further chances to extend their lead when a cross from the right by Henry was shot over the bar by Pirès and from the same area, Bergkamp's [...] "cross-cum-shot" [...] was missed by Ljungberg.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool {{dominated}} the opening exchanges, but struggled to create clear-cut chances. They almost went a goal behind when Frank Stapleton's header forced goalkeeper Ray Clemence into action. Seven {{minutes before the}} interval, Terry McDermott scored for Liverpool. The midfielder collected a pass from Ray Kennedy who surged through the centre, turned left and from outside the penalty area struck the ball low into the bottom left-hand corner. Arsenal began the second half with more vigour, but struggled to suppress Liverpool's attacks. Alan Kennedy found space to shoot after a one-two with Ray, but his effort went over the post. Arsenal were forced to make a substitution around the hour mark after Sammy Nelson collided with McDermott and was concussed; Willie Young replaced him. Liverpool extended their lead minutes later. Alan Hansen intercepted an Arsenal attack, strode forward and passed the ball to Dalglish. The striker approached the penalty area, cut inside Steve Walford <b>and</b> <b>curled</b> {{the ball into the}} right-hand corner. John Hollins came on for David Price, at which point Liverpool scored their third. Dalglish dispossessed Liam Brady, but tripped himself in the process. Johnson collected the ball and played it back to Dalglish, who charged forward and sprayed a pass towards McDermott, the furthest forward player on the right. The midfielder's shot went under the legs of Pat Jennings and into the goal. Alan Sunderland scored a late goal for Arsenal having combined well with Stapleton. This did not dampen the spirits of the Liverpool spectators, who chanted, [...] "What's it like to be outclassed?" [...] and, [...] "Why are we so great?" [...] {{during the course of the}} 90 minutes.|$|E
500|$|In Polk County, {{the storm}} left light {{property}} damage in Lakeland, reaching under $5,000, {{which included the}} school building being deroofed.

This was considered the worst tropical cyclone in the area since 1897. Lake County experienced sustained winds of [...] and [...] of rain in some areas. Much of the impact was confined to large trees being uprooted and ornamental vines suffering damage. A number of trees fell on electrical wires, causing power outages and disruptions to telephone service. Additionally, {{it is possible that}} a tornado touched down, based on some pine trees being [...] "splintered from top to bottom <b>and</b> <b>curled</b> up like molasses candy." [...] Damage to citrus crops was light, with losses conservatively estimated at less than 5%. Strong winds in Orange County left the entire city of Orlando without electricity, disrupting commerce. Citrus crops suffered no more than 5% in losses in the county. In St. Augustine, wind downed wires, some of which caused small fires in the business district. A steamship capsized between Jacksonville and Miami and there were reports of damage to several other small boats offshore. Agricultural damage from the hurricane was high, reaching over $2million, with more than $1million incurred to crops and the remainder to fertilizer and other materials. Citrus crops were especially hard hit, with 800,000 to 1,000,000boxes of fruit lost. Salt water, caused by coastal flooding, prevented cultivation of soil in some areas, though rainfall eventually washed away the salt. In all, the hurricane left at least eight people dead and about $10million in damage.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to small <b>and</b> <b>curled</b> up extra dimensions, {{there may be}} extra dimensions that instead aren't apparent because the matter associated with our visible universe is localized on a [...] subspace. Thus the extra dimensions need not be small and compact but may be large extra dimensions. D-branes are dynamical extended objects of various dimensionalities predicted by string theory that could play this role. They have the property that open string excitations, which are associated with gauge interactions, are confined to the brane by their endpoints, whereas the closed strings that mediate the gravitational interaction are free to propagate into the whole spacetime, or [...] "the bulk".
