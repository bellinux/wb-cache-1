5|$|Mugabe saw {{his defeat}} as <b>an</b> <b>unacceptable</b> {{personal}} humiliation. He deemed it {{a victory for}} his Western, and in particular British, detractors, whom he believed were working with Tsvangirai to end his political career. ZANU-PF claimed that the MDC had rigged the election.|$|E
5|$|The {{model was}} {{originally}} developed for programming decompression computers for constant oxygen partial pressure closed circuit rebreathers. Initial experimental diving using an exponential-exponential algorithm resulted in <b>an</b> <b>unacceptable</b> incidence of DCS, so a change {{was made to}} a model using the linear release model, with a reduction in DCS incidence.|$|E

40|$|Herein, {{authors have}} {{evaluated}} {{the specificity of}} CT angiography (CTA) in comparison with conventional invasive angiography (CIA) in the diagnosis of coronary stenosis. For this purpose, 8 patients suspected to stenosis was used. They were undertaken CIA procedure after CTA using 16 -multidetector-row machine. Result reveals that for patient-base analysis, the specificity of CTA was 25. The values of specificity reveal <b>a</b> <b>unacceptable</b> performance of CTA. However, due to low number of patients, the obtained results cannot be used for final decision...|$|R
5|$|Thrombolysis, stenting {{and surgery}} {{are not used}} as widely as anticoagulation or {{antiplatelet}} drugs. These treatments are invasive or more risky, and are typically reserved for situations where symptoms worsen despite medical treatment, or where medical treatment may be unsafe (e.g. <b>an</b> <b>unacceptable</b> bleeding tendency).|$|E
5|$|Because he {{was unable}} to afford {{university}} tuition, Truman had thought of going to the costless United States Military Academy at West Point, but he was refused an appointment because of poor eyesight. He enlisted in the Missouri Army National Guard in 1905, serving until 1911 in a Kansas City-based artillery battery and attaining the rank of corporal. At his induction, his eyesight had been <b>an</b> <b>unacceptable</b> 20/50 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left (past the standard for legal blindness). The second time he took the test, he passed by secretly memorizing the eye chart.|$|E
5|$|Deck {{decompression}} chambers {{are used}} for surface decompression, described in a previous section. Most deck decompression chambers are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathing gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause <b>an</b> <b>unacceptable</b> fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} five years in the Netherlands only an average of 67, 000 houses a year have been built, {{representing}} only 1 % of the total building stock. In new housing modern standards of comfort and a limited energy consumption can be realized. The majority of the existing housing stock however consists of outdated dwellings with <b>a</b> <b>unacceptable</b> high energy consumption. In this research a renovation method is described enabling an improvement of comfort and a reduction of energy use for outdated housing, stretching the service life with an extra 30 years...|$|R

5|$|The curial {{cardinals}} {{entered the}} conclave seeking to elect Gregorio Barbarigo as pope. Leopold I, the Holy Roman Emperor, considered {{him to be}} <b>an</b> <b>unacceptable</b> choice {{because he was a}} Venetian. While Leopold did not formally exclude Barbarigo, he did not wish for him to be elected. In addition to Leopold, the Spanish ambassador in Rome worked against Barbarigo's election, and Louis XIV of France opposed it because of the wishes of his allies.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a {{grandson}} of the King of France, raised {{the prospect of}} the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, <b>an</b> <b>unacceptable</b> state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714.|$|E
5|$|Though the M32 {{has a small}} traffic flow, {{it is one of}} {{the most}} {{congested}} motorways in the region as it connects a number of key areas. As well as providing one of the few high-quality routes into the centre of Bristol, it is the only significant link from the M4 to the A4174 Bristol Ring Road. Parts of the M32 are reaching the end of their intended lifespan, leading to reduced speed limits and occasional closures for remedial work. Local residents have criticised the M32, complaining that it has severed communities and has <b>an</b> <b>unacceptable</b> noise level.|$|E
50|$|The rock {{paintings}} are stylized polychromatic paintings using white, {{red and black}} colors. The {{paintings are}} said to have been enhanced by Lucullus Virgil McWhorter using enamel paints, <b>a</b> technique <b>unacceptable</b> to today's preservation community.|$|R
50|$|A {{paradox is}} a {{statement}} that, despite apparently sound reasoning from true premises, leads to a self-contradictory or <b>a</b> logically <b>unacceptable</b> conclusion. <b>A</b> paradox involves contradictory yet interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time.|$|R

5|$|By the 1890s {{electrical}} resonance {{was much}} more widely understood and had become {{a normal part of}} the engineer's toolkit. In 1891 Hutin and Leblanc patented an FDM scheme for telephone circuits using resonant circuit filters. Rival patents were filed in 1892 by Michael Pupin and John Stone Stone with similar ideas, priority eventually being awarded to Pupin. However, no scheme using just simple resonant circuit filters can successfully multiplex (i.e. combine) the wider bandwidth of telephone channels (as opposed to telegraph) without either <b>an</b> <b>unacceptable</b> restriction of speech bandwidth or a channel spacing so wide as to make the benefits of multiplexing uneconomic.|$|E
5|$|In December 1595, Kepler was {{introduced}} to Barbara Müller, a 23-year-old widow (twice over) with a young daughter, Regina Lorenz, and he began courting her. Müller, heiress to the estates of her late husbands, was also {{the daughter of a}} successful mill owner. Her father Jobst initially opposed a marriage despite Kepler's nobility; though he had inherited his grandfather's nobility, Kepler's poverty made him <b>an</b> <b>unacceptable</b> match. Jobst relented after Kepler completed work on Mysterium, but the engagement nearly fell apart while Kepler was away tending to the details of publication. However, Protestant officials—who had helped set up the match—pressured the Müllers to honor their agreement. Barbara and Johannes were married on April 27, 1597.|$|E
5|$|A deck {{decompression}} chamber (DDC), or double-lock chamber is a two compartment {{pressure vessel}} for human occupation which has sufficient space in the main chamber for two or more occupants, and a forechamber which can allow a person to be pressurised or decompressed while the main chamber remains under constant pressure. This allows an attendant to be locked in or out during treatment of the occupant(s) of the main chamber. There is usually also a medical lock, which serves a similar function but is much smaller. This is used to transfer medical material, food and specimens {{into and out of}} the main chamber while it is under pressure. Most {{deck decompression chamber}}s are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathig gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause <b>an</b> <b>unacceptable</b> fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E

5|$|During this time, Stanton {{maintained}} a broad focus on women's rights in general rather than narrowing her focus only to female suffrage in particular. After {{passage of the}} Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 and its support by the Equal Rights Association and prominent suffragists such as Stone, Blackwell, and Howe, the gap between Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other leaders of the women's movement widened as Stanton took issue with the fundamental religious leanings of several movement leaders. Unlike many of her colleagues, Stanton believed organized Christianity relegated women to <b>an</b> <b>unacceptable</b> position in society. She explored this view in the 1890s in The Woman's Bible, which elucidated a feminist understanding of biblical scripture and sought to correct the fundamental sexism Stanton believed was inherent to organized Christianity. Likewise, Stanton supported divorce rights, employment rights, and property rights for women, issues in which the American Women's Suffrage Association (AWSA) preferred not to become involved.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, 1948, the Soviet Union blocked {{access to}} the three Western-held sectors of Berlin. The Allies had not {{negotiated}} a deal to guarantee supply of the sectors deep within the Soviet-occupied zone. The commander of the American occupation zone in Germany, General Lucius D. Clay, proposed sending a large armored column across the Soviet zone to West Berlin with instructions to defend itself if it were stopped or attacked. Truman believed this would entail <b>an</b> <b>unacceptable</b> risk of war. He approved Ernest Bevin's plan to supply the blockaded city by air. On June 25, the Allies initiated the Berlin Airlift, a campaign to deliver food, coal and other supplies using military aircraft on a massive scale. Nothing like it had ever been attempted before, and no single nation had the capability, either logistically or materially, to accomplish it. The airlift worked; ground access was again granted on May 11, 1949. Nevertheless, the airlift continued for several months after that. The Berlin Airlift was one of Truman's great foreign policy successes; it significantly aided his election campaign in 1948.|$|E

50|$|Signature image {{processing}} (SIP) is a technology for analyzing electrical {{data collected from}} welding processes.
