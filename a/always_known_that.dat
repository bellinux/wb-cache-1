2500|$|Haneef's family {{celebrated his}} release. [...] "We've <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> he was {{innocent}} and now everyone else knows it too," [...] Haneef's sister, Sumayya said. [...] "It's been a year since we've last seen him and this last month has been so traumatic for us. We're all waiting to finally meet him. My brother has suffered so much this past month." ...|$|E
2500|$|While the {{trombone}} {{was featured}} prominently in dixieland and swing music, it {{fell out of}} favor among bebop musicians, largely because instruments with valves and keys (trumpet, saxophone) {{were believed to be}} more suited to bebop's often rapid tempos and demand for technical mastery. In 1946, bebop co-inventor Dizzy Gillespie encouraged the young trombonist's development with the comment, [...] "I've <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the trombone could be played different, that somebody'd catch on one of these days. Man, you're elected." ...|$|E
2500|$|French met Lenny Henry on the {{alternative}} comedy circuit. The couple married on 20 October 1984 in Covent Garden, London. They adopted a daughter, Billie. French {{has stated that}} Billie has <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> she was adopted, but once took out an injunction when a biographer came close to revealing the identity of Billie's biological mother. When faced with a question about how she and Henry would feel if Billie {{wanted to find out}} about her birth mother, French commented, [...] "Whatever she wants to do when she's 18, we'll support her. What I do worry about is anyone else making the decision for her." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1853, Wyld {{arranged}} with the prospector John Calvert to exhibit {{a collection of}} gold nuggets and precious stones discovered in Australia. The [...] "gold" [...] was later discovered to be gilded lead casts. Wyld started a court case against Calvert claiming {{that he had been}} deceived, but Calvert told the jury that Wyld had <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the genuine nuggets would not be displayed, had overseen the preparation of the casts and had even planned to drum up ticket sales with an elaborate publicity campaign based around a faked robbery, a charge that Wyld vehemently denied, stating that [...] "no one but one who had been the associate of convicts for fifteen years would have ventured to suggest such a question" [...] (a none-too-subtle reference to Calvert's time spent in Australia). The jury in the case was unable to reach a verdict, and while opinions differed on whether Wyld had been duped, it was clear that with topical exhibitions he had found a way to reinvigorate the attraction.|$|E
2500|$|Peter David {{returned}} to the character in another limited series, Aquaman: Time and Tide, a 1993–1994 four-issue series which further explained Aquaman's origins, as he finally learns all {{about the history of}} his people through the Atlantis Chronicles, which are presented as historical texts passed down and updated through the centuries. Aquaman learns that his birth name was Orin and that he and his enemy Ocean Master share the same father, [...] "an ancient Atlantean wizard" [...] named Atlan. This revelation sends Orin into a bout of rage and depression, setting the stage for later confrontations between the two, as it is said in the Chronicles that [...] "two brothers will also battle for control of Atlantis". This is in contrast to the Silver Age Aquaman, who had <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the Ocean Master was his half-brother Orm, although Orm's amnesia prevented him from remembering that fact for some time. This series is credited by Kevin Melrose of Comic Book Resources with helping the character reach the height of his modern-era popularity.|$|E
2500|$|Arriving at the cave, Cornelius is {{intercepted by}} Dr. Zaius and his soldiers. Taylor holds them off, {{threatening}} to shoot them {{if he has}} to. Zaius agrees to enter the cave to disprove their theories and to avoid physical harm to Cornelius and Zira. Inside, Cornelius displays {{the remnants of a}} technologically advanced human society pre-dating simian history. Taylor identifies artifacts such as dentures, eyeglasses, a heart valve and, to the apes' astonishment, a talking children's doll. More soldiers appear and Lucius is overpowered, but Taylor again fends them off. [...] Dr. Zaius is held hostage so Taylor can escape, but he admits to Taylor that he has <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> a human civilization existed long before apes ruled the planet and that [...] "the Forbidden Zone was once a paradise, your breed made a desert of it… ages ago!" [...] Taylor nonetheless thinks it best to search for answers, but Dr. Zaius warns him that he may not like what he finds. Once Taylor and Nova have ridden off, Dr. Zaius has the gorillas lay explosives to seal off the cave and destroy the remaining evidence of the human society. He then has Zira, Cornelius and Lucius charged with heresy.|$|E
5000|$|Pizzey said in 2009 {{that she}} has [...] "never been a feminist, because, having {{experienced}} my mother's violence, I <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> women can be as vicious and irresponsible as men".|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>know!</b> I <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> I would <b>know,</b> if I {{only thought}} hard enough. It is a club for {{fighting}} with. When {{the white men}} go to war they always use these things." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hama continued, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> a plot I {{sent him}} would be drawn with a keen {{attention}} to detail, aspects of the story would be improved upon, and my mistakes would be corrected." ...|$|R
60|$|JOHN. Yes. But {{at least}} she has <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> I never loved her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course he's an empty-headed idiot. Everybody has <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that.</b> And he's put {{above his}} place in the House. But it wouldn't do to quarrel with him now." ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, I had <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> {{this was}} the one flaw in my dedication, but how could I have {{expected}} her to have the wit to see it? I was very depressed.|$|E
2500|$|His {{daughter}} Elizabeth declared: [...] "In true editorial fashion, he {{was honest}} {{about the quality}} of his own writing. He felt it was fair to middling at best. He <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> his great talent was as an editor." ...|$|R
5000|$|Loret said he <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{his father}} had been a German soldier, but he had no idea of his identity. He claimed that his mother told him in 1948, shortly before her death, that the soldier was Adolf Hitler.|$|R
6000|$|Jane was {{overcome}} by this revelation. After a long pause, she said with deep conviction, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> I didn't. Oh, the way you kept it up! I solemnly declare that from this time forth I will believe nobody." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tito has <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> my life {{is bound}} up with my father's," [...] said Romola; [...] "and he is better to my father than I am: he delights in making him happy." ...|$|E
60|$|Jerry Nichols {{looked at}} him in honest consternation. He had <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> old Bill was a dear old ass, but he had never dreamed that he was such an infernal old ass as this.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{how does}} it feel to be sent for by the great sultan?" [...] she asked, as I stood before her fire. [...] "Of course, I have <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> {{ultimately}} he couldn't get along without you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, father," [...] she sighed, [...] "you {{know how}} far I go--how far I COULD go. But I only wish that if you ever SHOULD like anybody, you may never doubt of my feeling how I've brought you to it. You'll <b>always</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it's my fault." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{there is}} only one thing that it can be, Ailie, and you need not fear to tell me <b>that.</b> I <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> if he lived I must be {{prepared}} for it, and you would not have hesitated to tell me of his death." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{established}} endowed {{chairs in}} endocrinology, macular degeneration and skin cancer {{research at the}} University of Colorado School of Medicine and created endowments at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical College for research and for clinical scholars.

6000|$|... "I couldn't {{expect her}} to love me as I loved her. I'm a buffoon. I'm {{not the sort of}} man that women love. I've <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that.</b> I can't blame her if she's fallen in love with Strickland." ...|$|E
60|$|As for Marlin, I have <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> I {{could take}} some of these roundbill {{swordfish}} on light tackle. But likewise {{there have been some}} that could not have been taken so, and these are the swordfish I have fished for.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know," [...] {{the young}} fellow said. [...] "I have <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> you cared for Jack a {{thousand}} times more than for me, and it's quite natural, for he is worth a thousand of me; but then, then--" [...] and he hesitated.|$|E
6000|$|That {{blind man}} there {{said he would}} kill you. He came from Aoife's [...] country to kill you. That blind man said they had taught him every [...] kind of weapon that he might do it. But I <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> you would [...] kill him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well done!" [...] he exclaimed; [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{she was a}} plucky girl, and {{it needed}} courage, I can tell you, to burn herself as she has done, {{to say nothing of}} risking spoiling her beauty for life. No slight {{sacrifice}} for a woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Julian's gift {{of speech}} must have {{surprised}} even himself," [...] the Bishop remarked. [...] "Of course, we <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> 'Paul Fiske', {{when he was}} found, must be a brilliant person, but I don't think that even Julian himself had any suspicion of his oratorical powers." ...|$|R
60|$|Jerry Mitchell, {{after an}} instant of stunned bewilderment, {{was looking at}} her with worshipping admiration. He had <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> Miss Ann possessed a mind of no common order, but this, he felt, was genius. For a moment the magnificence of the idea took his breath away.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall mind horribly," [...] {{continued}} Molly, after a pause, [...] "but, of course, I have <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> {{something of}} the sort would have to happen one of these days. When a man goes into politics he can't call his soul his own, and I suppose his heart becomes an impersonal possession in the same way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't be," [...] said Rob grimly. [...] "After all, I'd rather {{love you}} than not, hurt as it will. I {{never had much}} hope of getting {{you to listen to}} me, so there's no great {{disappointment}} there. You're too good for me--I've <b>always</b> <b>known</b> <b>that.</b> A girl that is fit to mate with the Camerons is far above Rob Fletcher, fisherman." ...|$|E
6000|$|He <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{the lost}} {{manuscript}} was his great work. [...] "My seventh wave," [...] he called it; [...] "and though all the conditions were favourable," [...] he said, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I could run to {{nothing more than}} little waves at present. As for rewriting that book, I can't; I have tried." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "After the war I <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> nothing, nothing, {{could ever}} be as bad ..... but nothing could frighten me any more, I mean, no man could frighten me any more, no Director ..... nothing could {{be as bad as}} the war, or the things I saw in the war." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{girl had}} {{the making of}} a fine woman in her, and this proves it.
