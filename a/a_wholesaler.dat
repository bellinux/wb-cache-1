5|$|In 1938, Otto Frank {{started a}} second company, Pectacon, which was <b>a</b> <b>wholesaler</b> of herbs, {{pickling}} salts, and mixed spices, {{used in the}} production of sausages. Hermann van Pels was employed by Pectacon as an advisor about spices. A Jewish butcher, he had fled Osnabrück with his family. In 1939, Edith Frank's mother came to live with the Franks, and remained with them until her death in January 1942.|$|E
5|$|As of 1994, {{the line}} was intact and {{operational}} from Ganddal to Foss-Eigeland and the cement factory there. Here, an internal crane track has been welded across the line. From Foss-Eigeland to Figgjo, the track is intact. At Figgjo, a bridge has been demolished, {{and it is not}} possible to traverse that section. Except for a number of level crossings where the tracks have been asphalted over, the line remains intact to Ålgård. At Ålgård Station the tracks have been removed, but the station building and depot remains. The station at Foss-Eigeland has been converted to a church, while the station at Figgjo had been taken over by <b>a</b> <b>wholesaler.</b> The line has officially been closed, but has not been abandoned. The Norwegian National Rail Administration retains ownership and can in the future renovate the line for operation.|$|E
5|$|Wiesenthal {{was born}} at 11:30 pm on 31 December 1908, in Buczacz (Buchach), Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (then part of Austria-Hungary, now Ternopil Oblast, in Ukraine). His father, Asher Wiesenthal, was <b>a</b> <b>wholesaler</b> who had emigrated from the Russian Empire in 1905 to escape the {{frequent}} pogroms against Jews. A reservist in the Austro-Hungarian Army, Asher was called to active duty in 1914 {{at the start of}} World War I. He died in combat on the Eastern Front in 1915. The remainder of the family—Simon, his younger brother Hillel, and his mother Rosa—fled to Vienna as the Russian army took control of Galicia. The two boys attended a German-language Jewish school. The family returned to Buczacz in 1917 after the Russians retreated. The area changed hands several more times before the war ended in November 1918.|$|E

25|$|The {{customer}} can {{shop and}} order {{through the internet}} and the merchandise is dropped at the customer's doorstep or an e-tailer. In some cases, e-retailers use drop shipping technique.

25|$|The outlay {{of money}} on {{equipment}} varies greatly. Some items commonly found on Christmas tree farms are insecticide sprayers, tractors, and shaper sheers. Mechanized planters, {{at a cost of}} about US$4,000, are not essential but a work-saving luxury for farmers. Farmers can purchase seedlings, the lifeblood of a Christmas tree farm, from nurseries. One farmer in Oregon purchased seedlings for between US$200–300 per 1,000plants. The farmer, <b>a</b> <b>wholesaler,</b> sold his final products for about $20each; after the cost of the trees and other expenses, a profit of $2–3per tree.|$|E

25|$|As {{the founder}} of Texas Distributors, Inc., Lowe served as the {{technical}} father, but he carried that title to a personal level too. Texas Distributors was not only <b>a</b> <b>wholesaler</b> and an air conditioning contractor that provided a service to its customers and, hopefully, made a profit—it provided a steady employment and financial security for those who chose to work there. The profit-sharing plans were designed to limit cash outflow, and that helped employees by helping the company, but they also offered employees the opportunity to establish financial resources beyond their biweekly paychecks.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} Mecca was dry, but {{the climate of}} Medina was damp and this {{adversely}} affected {{the health of the}} immigrants, so that on arrival most of them fell sick. Abu Bakr also suffered from fever for several days and during this time he was attended to by Khaarijah and his family. At Mecca, Abu Bakr was a trader in cloth and he started the same business in Medina. He was <b>a</b> <b>wholesaler,</b> and had his store at Sunh, and from there cloth was supplied to the market at Medina. Soon his business flourished at Medina. Early in 623, Abu Bakr's daughter Aisha, who was already engaged to Muhammad, was handed over to Muhammad in a simple marriage ceremony, and this further strengthened the relation between Abu Bakr and Muhammad.|$|E
25|$|The {{forerunner of}} A {{was founded in}} the 1850s as Gilman & Company by George Gilman (1826–1901) to {{continue}} his father's leather tanning business; in 1858 the firm's address was 98 Gold Street in Manhattan. Gilman's father died in 1859, leaving the son wealthy. That year, Gilman & Company entered the tea and coffee business from that storefront. One source speculates that Gilman decided to enter a more respectable business {{in light of his}} wealth. In May 1861, Gilman turned over the tanning business to his brother Winthrop; George moved his tea business to 129 Front Street. Initially, Gilman & Company was <b>a</b> <b>wholesaler.</b> In early 1863 the firm became a retailer, Great American Tea Company. Quickly, it opened five stores, moving its office and warehouse to 51 Vesey Street.|$|E

25|$|Latex, rubber {{suspended}} in water, {{was invented in}} 1920. Youngs Rubber Company {{was the first to}} manufacture a latex condom, an improved version of their Trojan brand. Latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement-dipped rubber condoms, which had to be smoothed by rubbing and trimming. Because it used water to suspend the rubber instead of gasoline and benzene, it eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories. Latex condoms also performed better for the consumer: they were stronger and thinner than rubber condoms, and had a shelf life of five years (compared to three months for rubber). Europe's first latex condom was an export from Youngs Rubber Company in 1929. In 1932 the London Rubber Company, which had previously served as <b>a</b> <b>wholesaler</b> for German-manufactured condoms, became Europe's first manufacturer of latex condoms, the Durex.|$|E

He studied Jolin's numerous works and, as at this time the artists sold very few paintings, it came as a surprise to him when Gotthardt bought 16 canvases.

In February 1996, while the final components of the package were working their way through City Hall, Burke toured Cotter's [...] headquarters, {{at the end of}} which he handed out his business card from his private law practice and asked for the company's property tax appeals business. Cotter decided to hire Burke in March 1996 and finalized the arrangement in June 1996. An unprecedented $2.8 million cash grant from the City to Cotter, never publicized by the Daley administration, was included in a $20 million bond issue approved by the Finance Committee and the City Council by July 31, 1996.|$|E

2500|$|The {{government}} appealed, {{and by a}} 2–1 margin the jury's {{verdict was}} restored. Robert Arthur Sprecher, following United States v. Shryock, an earlier case from the Fifth Circuit where the defendant had been {{the head of the}} leasing department at a new-car dealership, held that the ongoing nature of the scheme distinguished the case and supported the jury verdict. But concurring Judge Richard Dickson Cudahy, calling the statute [...] "judicially [...] " [...] warned that [...] "the present case takes us to what (for now) may be the outer limits". Luther Merritt Swygert dissented. [...] "The mailings did not conceal the fraud, produce profit for Galloway or contribute to the consumer's harm," [...] he wrote. [...] "The mailings resulted from a transaction to which Galloway was not a party and they were routine business mailings the purposes of which were immaterial to Galloway." [...] He distinguished that case from Shryock by noting that Shryock had been a retail dealer, selling directly to consumers, instead of <b>a</b> <b>wholesaler.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Today {{there are}} a number of others {{involved}} in the craft. Aguilino Garcia sells fairly expensive skunks, crocodiles, armadillos, and palm trees. He has a reputation for working slowing but makes pieces that were selling for between 100 and 400 pesos in 1998. Better known is the husband and wife team of Reynaldo Santiago and Elodia Reyes, who have been carving since their marriage in the mid-1970s. Reynaldo is a nephew of Martin Santiago. [...] Like in many other carving families, he carves while she paints. Their children are not involved in their business. While the couple make some large and medium-sized pieces, they specialize in miniatures (around seven cm), such as dogs, cats, giraffes, rabbits and goats which will for around 30 pesos each. Because La Union gets few tourists, the couple is mostly reliant on the store owners and wholesalers who buy from them. Today their major buyers are <b>a</b> <b>wholesaler</b> in California and a store owner in Texas.|$|E

Paul had gone into his father's business, after graduation; he was now <b>a</b> <b>wholesaler</b> and small manufacturer of prepared-paper roofing.
