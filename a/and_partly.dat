5|$|A {{relatively}} {{small proportion of}} total membership comes from Canada. A growing portion of the Canadian demographic {{is made up of}} immigrant members of the church. This is partly the result of Canadian demographics as a whole, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> due to decreased interest amongst late generation Canadians. The largest concentration of active congregations in Canada are in Southern Ontario, with notable congregations gathering in Beamsville, Bramalea, Niagara Falls, Vineland, Toronto (several), and Waterloo. Although many congregations of various sizes (typically under 300 members) meet all across Canada.|$|E
5|$|A severe {{regression}} {{would have}} greatly reduced the continental shelf area, {{which is the}} most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E

5|$|After graduating, Synge {{decided that}} he wanted to be a {{professional}} musician and went to Germany to study music. He stayed in Coblenz during 1893 and moved to Würzburg in January 1894. Partly because he was shy about performing in public, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> because of doubt about his ability, he decided to abandon music and pursue his literary interests. He returned to Ireland in June 1894, and moved to Paris in January 1895 to study literature and languages at the Sorbonne.|$|E
5|$|Although {{earmarked}} for operations against the Soviet Union, Luftflotte 2 {{remained in the}} west until May 1941. This was partly as a deception measure, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> because new airbases in Poland could not be completed by 1 June 1941 target date, although they were made ready {{in time for the}} actual commencement of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941. Kesselring established his new headquarters at Bielany, a suburb of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{development}} of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> because {{of the impact of the}} sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.|$|E

5|$|Even so, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> {{because of}} Sickles's {{unexpected}} location, Longstreet's assault did not proceed according to Lee's plan. Instead of wheeling left {{to join a}} simultaneous two-division push {{on either side of}} the Emmitsburg Road, Hood's division attacked in a more easterly direction than intended, and McLaws's and Anderson's divisions deployed brigade by brigade, in an en echelon style of attack, also heading more to the east than the intended northeast.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{biology is}} partly based on paleontology, which uses {{the fossil record}} to answer {{questions}} about the mode and tempo of evolution, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> on the developments in areas such as population genetics. In the 1980s, developmental biology re-entered evolutionary biology after its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary developmental biology. Phylogenetics, systematics, and taxonomy are related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology.|$|E

5|$|French Sudan {{originally}} {{formed as}} a set of military outposts {{as an extension of the}} French colony in Senegal. Though the area offered France little economic or strategic gain, the military effectively advocated greater conquest in the region. This was partly due to a fascination with the great empires, such as the Mali Empire and the Songhay Empire that rose to prominence in the area, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> due to the promotional opportunities that military conquest offered for French military personnel.|$|E
5|$|From his Oxford years onward, Auden's friends uniformly {{described}} him as funny, extravagant, sympathetic, generous, <b>and,</b> <b>partly</b> by his own choice, lonely. In groups he was often dogmatic and overbearing in a comic way; in more private settings he was diffident and shy except when certain of his welcome. He was punctual in his habits, and obsessive about meeting deadlines, while choosing to live amidst physical disorder.|$|E
5|$|Horses have a {{great sense}} of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> to highly {{developed}} proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times. A horse's sense of touch is well developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.|$|E

5|$|In 1892 Holst {{wrote the}} music for an {{operetta}} {{in the style of}} Gilbert and Sullivan, Lansdown Castle, or The Sorcerer of Tewkesbury. The piece was performed at Cheltenham Corn Exchange in February 1893; it was well received and its success encouraged him to persevere with composing. He applied for a scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London, but the composition scholarship for that year was won by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. Holst was accepted as a non-scholarship student, and Adolph borrowed £100 to cover the first year's expenses. Holst left Cheltenham for London in May 1893. Money was tight, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> from frugality <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> from his own inclination he became a vegetarian and a teetotaller. Two years later he was finally granted a scholarship, which slightly eased his financial difficulties, but he retained his austere personal regime.|$|E
5|$|In Justinian's reign, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> {{under his}} patronage, Byzantine culture {{produced}} noteworthy historians, including Procopius and Agathias, and poets such as Paul the Silentiary and Romanus the Melodist flourished. On the other hand, centres of learning as the Platonic Academy in Athens {{and the famous}} Law School of Beirut lost their importance during his reign. Despite Justinian's passion for the glorious Roman past, the practice of choosing Roman consul was allowed to lapse after 541.|$|E

In Britain, thickwalled <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> underground World War II pillboxes have been converted to make roosts for bats, and purpose-built bat houses are occasionally built to mitigate damage to habitat from road or other developments.|$|E
5|$|Much of Wodehouse's use of slang terms {{reflects}} {{the influence of}} his time at school in Dulwich, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> reflects Edwardian slang. As a young man he enjoyed the literary works of Arthur Conan Doyle and Jerome K. Jerome, and the operatic works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Wodehouse quotes from and alludes to numerous poets throughout his work. The scholar Clarke Olney lists those quoted, including Milton, Byron, Longfellow, Coleridge, Swinburne, Tennyson, Wordsworth and Shakespeare.|$|E
