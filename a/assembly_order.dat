40|$|The {{effects of}} a number of {{essentially}} different work order release and flow time allowance policies on the <b>assembly</b> <b>order</b> flow times and <b>assembly</b> <b>order</b> due date performance are investigated. Work orders within an <b>assembly</b> <b>order</b> have different routing length. The <b>assembly</b> <b>order</b> flow time is the time that elapses between the release of the first work order and the completion of the last work order of the <b>assembly</b> <b>order.</b> The timing of the release of work orders, and the distribution of the flow time allowance over the work orders in an <b>assembly</b> <b>order</b> were varied, and used systematic computer simulation to investigate the effects on performance. The results show that the best performance is obtained with simultaneous work order release, an average operation flow time allowance equal to the average operation waiting time and equalized flow time allowances per work order in an <b>assembly</b> <b>order...</b>|$|E

40|$|Both {{the order}} in which species arrive in a community, and {{environmental}} conditions, such as temperature, are known to affect community structure. Little is known, however, about the potential for, and occurrence of, interactions between assembly history and the environment. Of particular, interest may be the interaction between temperature and community assembly dynamics, especially in the light of predicted global climatic change and the fundamental processes that are governed, through metabolic rate, by an individual's environmental temperature. We present, to our knowledge, the first experimental exploration of how the influence of assembly history, temperature, and the interaction between the two alters the structure of communities of competitors, using small-scale protist microcosm communities where temperature and <b>assembly</b> <b>order</b> were manipulated factorially. In our experiment, the most important driver of long-term abundance was temperature but long-lasting <b>assembly</b> <b>order</b> effects influenced the relationship between temperature and abundance. Any advantage of early colonization proved to be short-lived, and there was rarely any long-term advantage to colonizing a habitat before other species. The results presented here suggest that environmental conditions shape community composition, but that occasionally temperature could interact with the stochastic nature of community assembly to significantly alter future community composition, especially where temperature change has been large. This could have important implications for the dynamics of both rare and invasive species...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{a formal}} {{high-level}} language {{is used to}} generate simulations where a manikin assembles flexible cables. The language generates assembly instructions for the manikin, which automatically performs the corresponding assembly motion with as good ergonomic as possible. Due to weight, stiffness and narrow regions, {{it may be difficult}} to perform an assembly of the cable. Our approach allows us to verify that it may be performed in an ergonomically sound way. The generated instructions are formally verified to ensure that <b>assembly</b> <b>order</b> is held and to prevent erroneous assembly states. The simulations have been made on industrial test cases...|$|E

40|$|Tris-chelated metal {{complexes}} with octahedral geometry {{are sometimes}} used as {{building blocks for}} "self assembly" and "crystal engineering". These versatile building blocks easily form honey-comb type 2 D nets. However, in this Perspective we discuss {{the different types of}} 3 D nets that can be formed with these starting materials using Wells classification, and concentrate on the (10, 3) nets. We show that several of these, and not only the (10, 3) -a net, are possible by analysing the geometrical requirements of each net. We note that each possible net implies a specific <b>assembly</b> <b>order</b> of Delta or Lambda chirality of the building blocks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{instruct}} on-site workers {{to accomplish the}} assembly job fast and exactly, improve the assembly quality and efficiency, we proposed a management method for assembly technical annotation in 3 D assembly instruction. This method maps 3 D technical annotations to assembly operation and assembly time based on time sequence granularity, achieves the goal of showing assembly technical annotations based on assembly process. We demonstrated {{the effectiveness of this}} method with a satellite antenna feed component’s assembly process instance. The instance shows that this method can mark assembly technical annotations based on assembly process, and show the annotations in time sequence but not in assembly space. This will help on-site assembly workers to understand the <b>assembly</b> <b>order</b> fast and unambiguously, finish the assembly operations correctly...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} design {{methodology}} for a nanoscale selfassembling fabrication process {{that uses the}} specificity of DNA hybridization to guide the formation of electrical circuitry. Custom design software allows us to specify the function of a structure in a way {{similar to that used}} by VLSI circuit designers. In an analogous manner to generating masks for a photolithographic process, our software generates an assembly procedure including DNA sequence allocation. We have found that the number of unique DNA sequences needed to assemble a structure scales with its surface area. Using a simple face-serial <b>assembly</b> <b>order</b> we can specify an unambiguous assembly sequence for a structure of any size with only 15 unique DNA sequences.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the design of}} passive robotically-reconfigurable truss structures and progress towards a robot capable of manipulating such structures. The elements {{are designed to be}} inserted and removed singly in “random access, ” thus eliminating some <b>assembly</b> <b>order</b> constraints and enabling a physical realization of the construction process. The proposed robot is a “hinge ” robot that can demonstrate manipulating said elements. The robot is also designed to be able to traverse arbitrary scale truss structures. With the addition of reconfiguration algorithms discussed by Lobo in [1], we suggest that such reconfigurable structures and robots could open the door to a machine metabolic process where structures are decomposed and recomposed autonomously to meet varying needs to a variety of applications from infrastructure recovery to space exploration.

Results of these experiments show that different grazer species have a different effect on eelgrass, that presence of the native isopod Idotea reduces herbivory by A. valida, that A. valida recruits to one donor source in greater abundance than another, that A. valida preferentially feeds on eelgrass from one donor source over others and {{that the role of}} phenolic concentrations in these interactions is unclear...|$|E

40|$|Southern {{shipbuilding}} in 1861 was {{comparable to}} construction throughout the United States. Confederate ships {{early in the}} war show continuity of these traditions, but beginning in 1862, wartime stimuli created a distinct Confederate shipbuilding style. This thesis examines changes in the Confederacy's conceptual approach to construction by tracing pre-war shipbuilding traditions and popular trends in naval architecture.   As a consequence of shipbuilders' conservative nature, ships' structural systems and <b>assembly</b> <b>order</b> change gradually, allowing traditions to be traced. A decentralized shipbuilding program led {{to high levels of}} variability between Confederate ships, even among vessels of the same class. Local shipbuilders used vernacular methods to expedite construction. Historical and archaeological examination of the CSS Neuse and Jackson, two diamond hull ironclads today housed in museums, identified the progression of Confederate shipbuilding and the non-traditional features in their construction.   M.

40|$|Is {{the order}} in which {{proteins}} assemble into complexes important for biological function? Here, we seek to address this by searching for evidence of evolutionary selection for ordered protein complex assembly. First, we experimentally characterize the assembly pathways of several heteromeric complexes and show that they can be simply predicted from their three-dimensional structures. Then, by mapping gene fusion events identified from fully sequenced genomes onto protein complex assembly pathways, we demonstrate evolutionary selection for conservation of <b>assembly</b> <b>order.</b> Furthermore, using structural and high-throughput interaction data, we show that fusion tends to optimize assembly by simplifying protein complex topologies. Finally, we observe protein structural constraints on the gene order of fusion that impact the potential for fusion to affect assembly. Together, these results reveal the intimate relationships among protein assembly, quaternary structure, and evolution and demonstrate on a genome-wide scale the biological importance of ordered assembly pathways...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the authors is to deliver specifications and underlying concepts for future computer-aided tools for the design and the control of flexible manufacturing systems for mechanical and electro-mechanical assemblies. This book presents an integrated computer-aided method which supports a concurrent engineering approach for assembled products. This integrated method is divided in several modules which analyse the ease of assembly of a design, the <b>assembly</b> <b>order,</b> the design of an assembly workshop, and the simulation of the workshop taking into account scheduling and flow control. Automatic, semi-automatic and manual utilisations are presented for each module. Communication between design and manufacturing has been emphasised. The environment in this book is a real concurrent engineering one {{and for the first}} time the concurrent engineering steps are integrated in a CAD system.
