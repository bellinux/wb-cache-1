40|$|ABSTRACTSThe {{treatment}} of chondral knee injuries remains {{a challenge for}} the orthopedic surgeon, mainly owing to {{the characteristics of the}} cartilage tissue, which promote low potential for regeneration. Chondral lesions can be caused by metabolic stimulation, or by genetic, vascular and traumatic events, and are classified according to the size and thickness of the affected cartilage. Clinical diagnosis can be difficult, especially due to insidious symptoms. Additional tests, as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), may be needed. The {{treatment of}} these lesions usually starts with non-operative management. Surgery should be reserved for patients with detached chondral fragments, blocked range of motion, or the failure of non-operative treatment. The surgical techniques used for the treatment of partial thickness defects are Debridement and Ablation. These techniques aim to improve symptoms, since they do not restore normal structure and function of the cartilage. For full-thickness defects (osteochondral lesion), available treatments are <b>Abrasion,</b> <b>Drilling,</b> Microfracture, Osteochondral Autologous and Allogeneic Transplantation, and biological techniques {{such as the use of}} Autologous Chondrocyte Transplantation, Minced Cartilage and stem cells...|$|R
40|$|A b s t r a c t Full-thickness {{cartilage}} defects {{are common}} and serious problems in today knee surgery. The limited {{ability of the}} cartilage to repair the injured surface is generally known. Clinical symptoms in cases with full thickness defects are severe and lead to premature development of osteoarthritis. Numerous techniques to treat chondral defects (<b>abrasion,</b> <b>drilling,</b> autografts, allografts and cell transplantation) have been developed. One of the new cartilage repair techniques is the autologous chondrocyte transplantation combined with tissue glue Tissucol (Baxter, Austria). This technique was developed in Traumatological Hospital Brno. The first patient was operated in 1998 and 25 patients underwent such procedure until December 2002. Group of 14 patients was prospectively evaluated after 1 year of follow-up. This technique provides stable short-term outcomes with high percentage of good to excellent results – 71 % of patients (according to the Lysholm knee score). Average Lysholm score in the studied group was 76. 5 points 5 months after transplantation and 81. 0 points 12 months after transplantation. Second-look arthroscopy in 4 patients certified good healing of defects. Cartilage surface was evaluated according to ICRS cartilage score with average value 8. 0 points. Control biopsy documented formation of reparative tissue with hyaline-like cartilage and presence of typical chondrocytes and collagenous filaments.

40|$|Osteochondral lesions (OCL) of the talar dome have {{received}} {{a great deal of}} attention as disorders that cause ankle pain. Clinicians normally first attempt nonoperative treatment of these lesions, but if such treatment fails, surgical treat-ments including debridement, 32 <b>abrasion,</b> <b>drilling,</b> curet-tage, 4, 6, 16, 20, 22, 26, 27, 31 internal fixation of the fragment, 14 autologous osteochondral graft, 2, 10, 23, 24 or autologous chon-drocyte transplantation are attempted. Of these surgeries, arthroscopic drilling is an effective technique that can improve symptoms with less morbidity 13, 16, 27 and is one of the most frequently used methods. However, the disadvan-tages of transmalleolar drilling (TMD), the traditional mode of arthroscopic drilling, are that the undetached talar carti-lage can be damaged when the Kirschner wire is inserted into the lesion, and the intact tibial cartilage can also be injured when the wire is inserted. 27 The advantage of retrograde drilling (RD), reported in 1999 by Taranow et al, 30 is that it is possible to avoid injuring the articular cartilage because RD is not a transarticular procedure. However, there have been few reports on the clinical results of RD. We hypothe-sized that RD would be more effective than TMD for lesions without cartilage detachment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of RD for OCL of the talar dome by comparing the results of patients who underwent TMD with those of patients who underwent RD...|$|R

Although the causes of osteochondral lesions of the talus are not completely understood, idiopathic avascular necrosis and trauma are often cited. 8, 10, 15, 24, 61 It is well understood that injured cartilage lacks an intrinsic ability to heal completely secondary to the avas-cular environment, the immobility of chondrocytes, and the limited ability of mature chondrocytes to proliferate. 44, 60 Thus, {{it is not uncommon}} that osteochondral lesions of the talus require surgical management.

30|$|Articular {{cartilage}} {{over the}} surface of epiphysis of bone is a highly specialized connective tissue formed by chondrocytes, enabling almost smooth, frictionless movement between the articulating surfaces of diarthrodial joints. Due to its intrinsic limited potential for self-healing, damaged articular cartilage is not capable of restoring its original structure and functions and often degenerates towards osteoarthritis. Currently available therapeutic options in the clinics have increasingly focused on cell-based approaches including bone marrow stimulation techniques (microfracture, pridie <b>drilling,</b> <b>abrasion)</b> that promote the penetration of chondroregenerative cells from the subchondral bone marrow in sites of cartilage lesions (Madry et al. 2010). Yet, such procedures do not allow to reproduce the original cartilage, allowing only for the production of a fibrocartilaginous repair tissue made of type-I collagen and of poor mechanical quality, but not of the native, highly organized hyaline cartilage (proteoglycans, type-II collagen) capable of supporting joint loading and motion (Breinan et al. 2000; Frisbie et al. 2003; Madry et al. 2010; Orth et al. 2014).|$|R

40|$|Drill holes made by predators in prey shells {{are widely}} {{considered}} to be the most unambiguous bodies of evidence of predator-prey interactions in the fossil record. However, recognition of traces of predatory origin from those formed by abiotic factors still waits for a rigorous evaluation as a prerequisite to ascertain predation intensity through geologic time and to test macroevolutionary patterns. New experimental data from tumbling various extant shells demonstrate that abrasion may leave holes strongly resembling the traces produced by drilling predators. They typically represent singular, circular to oval penetrations perpendicular to the shell surface. These data provide an alternative explanation to the drilling predation hypothesis for the origin of holes recorded in fossil shells. Although various non-morphological criteria (evaluation of holes for non-random distribution) and morphometric studies (quantification of the drill hole shape) have been employed to separate biological from abiotic traces, these are probably insufficient to exclude abrasion artifacts, consequently leading to overestimate predation intensity. As a result, from now on, we must adopt more rigorous criteria to appropriately distinguish <b>abrasion</b> artifacts from <b>drill</b> holes, such as microstructural identification of micro-rasping traces...|$|R
40|$|Osteochondral {{defects in}} the knee can be {{disabling}} causing persistent pain, giving way, locking, catching and swelling {{and a reduction in}} activities including sport. Traditionally symptomatic defects were treated with marrow stimulation techniques such as <b>drilling,</b> <b>abrasion</b> and microfracture of the subchondral bone which have had limited success with usually the production of a fibrocartilage repair. This repair tissue tends to be soft and. degenerates over a period of time. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACt) has produced hyatine or hyaline-like repair tissue in experimental models and in the clinical setting in early studies, with the potential for permanent regeneration of articutar cartitage, thus preventing early onset osteoarthritis. This study reviews the clinical results of 3 techniques of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACt) : the more traditional periosteum covered ACt (AGI-P) implant, the collagen-covered ACI (ACI-C) and the matrix carried autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI). Single cohort studies of ACt-P and ACI-C over a 4 year period were made together with the provisional results of the MACI procedure at 1 year. Then 2 prospectively randomized studies were performed to compare ACI-C with ACt-P and MACI with ACt-C. Finally a small series of patients were reviewed who had a chondrocyte transplantation combined with other surgical techniques such as an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction or tibial osteotomy. A review of these patients revealed a significant improvement in their clinical scores over 4 years for the ACI-C and ACI-P technique in keeping with previously published data and also for the MACi technique at 1 year. Interestingly, a large number of the ACI-P patients developed graft hypertrophy which required arthroscopic debridement since patients complained of pain and catching.

40|$|Predicting {{the wear}} of drill bits is {{essential}} for all oil companies to maximise drilling efficiency and reduce loss in money and time. Typically, this problem has been dealt with by evaluating the specific energy of the drill bits at drilling formation intervals. Although this technique sometimes provides a good indication of the bit tooth wear, a number of phenomena such as bit balling and high vibration of the drill bit might give misleading results that affect the reliability of these techniques. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} develop an effective predictive tool for the bit tooth wear rate by both experimental and theoretical approaches. A case study is presented for the evaluation of the specific energy combined with dimensionless drilling parameters method as indicating tools for monitoring the wear of the roller-cone bits. The results were compared with the qualitative tooth wear index of the bits and an agreement was found for limited cases. The case study did not include the mechanical properties of the materials that form the bit, therefore a wear model was needed to combine the drilling parameters with the mechanical properties of the materials forming the bit under the phenomena of three body <b>abrasion</b> where the <b>drill</b> bits are in reality facing this effect. The new formula for quantifying the bit tooth wear is presented and compared with the qualitative bit tooth wear index, where close matching was obtained. Experimental studies were carried out on polycrystalline diamond compact cutters from two manufacturers. The mechanical properties were determined by micro-indentation as well as nano-indentation testing on the diamond and the substrate layers of the cutters. Microstructural properties of the materials forming the PDC cutters found to be effective on the mechanical properties and consequently on the amount of wear. The volume of wear for the PDC cutters was determined experimentally using micro and nano-scratch tests of PDC cutters. The experimental wear was compared with the predicted wear based on current approaches in the literature. The results show that the wear of both layers of PDC cutters in this work can be predicted by the material mechanical properties and the applied load on the indenter. The analytical study based on various scanning electron microscopy techniques revealed that the main dominant wear mechanism for the substrate and the diamond layers is abrasive wear in the format of ploughing and cutting. ...|$|R
