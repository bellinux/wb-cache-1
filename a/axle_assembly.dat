The boom pivot is mounted on the front <b>axle</b> <b>assembly</b> and a small winch is mounted on an extension to the smokebox {{in front of the}} chimney, the cable passing over a sheave {{at the top of the}} boom arm. The winch is powered by bevel gears on a shaft driven directly from the engine, with some form of clutch providing raise/lower control. These road locomotives can be used to load a trailer as well as to haul it to a new location. They are often referred to as 'crane engines'.|$|E
25|$|The Shelby GT-H was a fleet {{vehicle for}} Hertz car rental outlets and traced its roots to the 1966 Shelby GT350H. The GT-H was {{available}} only in Hertz's corporate colors: black exterior and twin gold racing stripes. It included a billet aluminum grille, a Shelby hood with functional hood pins, as well as front and rear fascias that were later used on Shelby GT and GT/CS models. The GT-H came with the Power Pack that included a cold air intake, revised exhaust system and custom performance calibration, boosting power to 319hp (238kW) and torque to 330lb·ft (447N·m). The GT-H also includes the handling package with lowering springs, improved dampers, sway bars, a strut tower brace and a 3.55:1 ratio rear <b>axle</b> <b>assembly.</b> A total of 500 units were ordered by Hertz for the 2006 model year, and 500 convertible models were announced for 2008.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{changes were}} {{in store for}} the Plymouth Duster. Simpler single-piston slider-type disc brake {{calipers}} were introduced for 1973 (standard on 318-powered cars and with power-assist on 340 models), replacing the Kelsey Hayes four-piston calipers. Disc brake-equipped Dusters now had the more-common 5-lugs on 4.5" [...] wheel bolt pattern. All 340 and some 318 engine-equipped cars received the simplified 8.25" [...] rear <b>axle</b> <b>assembly</b> (with wheel bearings riding directly on the axle shaft and endplay being taken by C-clips); these axles also featured the 5-on-4.5" [...] wheel bolt pattern. (This <b>axle</b> <b>assembly</b> replaced the 8.75" [...] "drop-out" [...] arrangement seen on some 1966-1972 A-bodies). The 225-powered cars retained the 5-lugs on 4" [...] pattern on vehicles with the standard drum brakes. A three speed Torque Flight automatic along with a manual transmission was offered with the 225 slant six. All models received larger front wheel bearings and increased spindle diameter. Electronic ignition became standard across the board.|$|E
50|$|In May 2014, two {{trainsets}} (one on the Brown Line {{and one on}} the Orange Line) were retrofitted with LED destination signs {{similar to}} those on the 5000-series cars as a project for a mid-life overhaul for the cars. The overhaul plans were approved on August 14, 2014. In addition to new LED destination signs, new air conditioning systems are being installed, and the propulsion systems, passenger door motors, and wheel and <b>axle</b> <b>assemblies</b> are being rebuilt.

40|$|Abstract: Automotive chassis is a {{skeletal}} {{frame on}} which various mechanical parts like engine, tires, <b>axle</b> <b>assemblies,</b> brakes, steering etc. are bolted. It {{is the most}} crucial element that gives strength and stability to the vehicle under different conditions. Automobile frames provide strength and flexibility to the automobile. The backbone of any automobile, it is the supporting frame to which the body of an engine, <b>axle</b> <b>assemblies</b> are affixed. Role of the chassis {{is to provide a}} structural platform that can connect the front and rear suspension without excessive deflection Moreover; it should be rigid enough to withstand the shock, twist, vibration and other stresses. So, strength and stiffness are two main criteria for the design of the chassis. The present study has analyzed the various literatures. After a careful analysis of various research studies conducted so for it has been found that sufficient studies have not been conducted on variable section chassis concept. This Paper describes Structural analysis & optimization of vehicle chassis with constraints of maximum shear stress and deflection of chassis under maximum load. The dimensions of an existing vehicle chassis of a TATA 912 Diesel bus is taken for analysis with materials namely Steel alloy (Austenitic) subjected to the same load. The three different vehicle chassis have been modeled by considering three different cross-sections. Namely C, I, and Rectangular Box (Hollow) type cross sections.

40|$|Significant {{improvements}} in load handling {{can be made}} to light trucks with the application of a tandem rear suspension. Most current concepts involve two complete <b>axle</b> <b>assemblies</b> with all the associated drive components. This concept is good, but an alternative method of transferring power to the rear most axle that is discussed in this paper provides additional benefits. This research effort resulted in a preliminary design for a drive box that will allow the driver to disengage the rear most axle when extra traction is not required. By disengaging part of the drive-line, there is an increase in system efficiency versus the current methods. The resulting design is mechanically sound, but as will be discussed, may not be an economically and weight feasible idea...|$|R
