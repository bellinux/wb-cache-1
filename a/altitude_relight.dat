40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study was}} conducted to evaluate the effect of variations in fuel properties on the design of an external fuel vaporizaton system. The fuel properties that were considered included thermal stability, critical temperature, enthalpy a critical conditions, volatility, and viscosity. The design parameters that were evaluated included vaporizer weight and the impact on engine requirement such as maintenance, transient response, performance, and <b>altitude</b> <b>relight.</b> The baseline fuel properties were those of Jet A. The variation in thermal stability was taken as the thermal stability variation for Experimental Referee Broad Specification (ERBS) fuel. The results of the analysis indicate that a change in thermal stability equivalent to that of ERBS would increase the vaporization system weight by 20 percent, decrease oprating time between cleaning by 40 percent and make <b>altitude</b> <b>relight</b> more difficult. An increase in fuel critical temperature of 39 K would require a 40 percent increase in vaporization system weight. The assumed increase in enthalpy and volatility would also increase vaporizer weight by 40 percent and make <b>altitude</b> <b>relight</b> extremely difficult.

40|$|The major {{objective}} of this experimental program {{was to investigate the}} effects of fuel property variation on <b>altitude</b> <b>relight</b> characteristics. Four fuels with widely varying volatility properties (JP- 4, Jet A, a blend of Jet A and 2040 Solvent, and Diesel 2) were tested in a five-swirl-cup-sector combustor at inlet temperatures and flows representative of windmilling conditions of turbofan engines. The effects of fuel physical properties on atomization were eliminated by using four sets of pressure-atomizing nozzles designed to give the same spray Sauter mean diameter (50 + or - 10 micron) for each fuel at the same design fuel flow. A second series of tests was run with a set of air-blast nozzles. With comparable atomization levels, fuel volatility assumes only a secondary role for first-swirl-cup lightoff and complete blowout. Full propagation first-cup blowout were independent of fuel volatility and depended only on the combustor operating conditions...|$|E

The combustor design features scoops on the outer liner for controlling the primary- and secondary-zone airflow distribution. Combustor inlet total pressures were limited to 62 N/sq cm (90 psia) with inlet-air temperatures from 590 K (600 F) to 890 K (1150 F). At a diffuser inlet Mach number of 0. 25, the exit temperature pattern factor was 0. 44 with an average exit temperature of 1436 K (2124 F) and a total pressure loss of 4. 3 percent.

By utilizing quench devices with different sizes of holes under the same blockage ratio in mainstream position, this paper describes the characteristics of flow structures of quench zone in a RQL/TVC. The results show that, through the quench devices, the mainstream flow quickly mixes with the flow from the cavity zone under variable mixing levels which are related to the changing of different sizes of holes.

Configurations were tested that met the emission goals at idle operating conditions for carbon monoxide and for unburned hydrocarbons (emission index values of 20 and 4, respectively). Configurations were also tested that met a smoke number goal of 15 at sea-level take-off conditions. None of the configurations met {{the goal for}} oxides of nitrogen emissions at sea-level take-off conditions. The best configurations demonstrated oxide of nitrogen emission levels that were approximately 61 percent lower than those produced by the JT 9 D- 7 engine, but these levels were still approximately 24 percent above the goal of an emission index level of 10. Additional combustor performance characteristics, including lean blowout, exit temperature pattern factor and radial profile, pressure loss, altitude stability, and <b>altitude</b> <b>relight</b> characteristics were documented.

40|$|Pollutant {{emissions}} from {{aircraft in the}} vicinity of airports and at altitude are of great public concern due to their impact on environment and human health. The legislations aimed at limiting aircraft emissions have become more stringent over the past few decades. This has resulted in an urgent need to develop low emissions combustors in order to meet legislative requirements and reduce the impact of civil aviation on the environment. This article provides a comprehensive review of low emissions combustion technologies for modern aero gas turbines. The review considers current high Technologies Readiness Level (TRL) technologies including Rich-Burn Quick-quench Lean-burn (RQL), Double Annular Combustor (DAC), Twin Annular Premixing Swirler combustors (TAPS), Lean Direct Injection (LDI). It further reviews some of the advanced technologies at lower TRL.

40|$|AbstractA {{trapped vortex}} {{combustor}} (TVC) {{has been a}} very promising novel concept for it offers improvements in lean blow out, <b>altitude</b> <b>relight,</b> operating range, as well as a potential to decrease NOx emissions compared to conventional combustors. The present paper discusses the improved designs of the new combustor over the prior ones of our research group, including that: a) the overall dimensions, both axial and radial, are reduced to those of an actual aero-engine combustor; b) the air flow distribution is optimized, and especially 15 (of the air is fed into the liner as cooling air; c) a straight-wall diffuser with divergence angle 9 °is added. A series of experiments (cavity-fueled only, under atmospheric pressure) has been conducted to investigate the performance of the improved TVC. Experimental results show that at the inlet temperature of 523 K, the inlet pressure of 0. 1 MPa, stable operation of the TVC test rig is observed for the Mach number 0. 15 – 0. 34, indicating good flame stability; the combustion efficiency obtained in this paper falls into the range of 60 %− 96 % as the total excess air ratio increases, the combustion efficiency decreases, while the increase of the inlet temperature is beneficial to high combustion efficiency; besides, the optimal Mach numbers for high combustion efficiency under different inlet conditions are confirmed. The outlet temperature profiles feature a bottom in the mid-height of the exit.

40|$|Engine {{performance}} modelling is a {{major part}} of the engine design process, in which specialist solvers are employed to predict, understand and analyse the engine’s behaviour at various operating conditions. Sub-idle whole engine performance synthesis solvers are not as reliable and accurate as design point solvers. Lack of knowledge and data result in component characteristics being reverse-engineered or extrapolated from above-idle data. More stringent requirements on groundstart and relight capabilities, has prompted the need to advance the knowledge on low-speed engine performance, thereby requiring more robust sub-idle performance synthesis solvers. The objective of this study, was to improve the accuracy and reliability of a current aero gas turbine sub-idle performance solver by studying each component in isolation through numerical simulations. Areas researched were: low-speed and locked-rotor com- pressor characteristics, low-power combustion efficiency, air blast atomizer and combustor performance at sub-idle, torque-based whole engine sub-idle performance synthesis, and mixer performance at far oﬀ-design conditions. The observations and results from the numerical simulations form the contribution to knowledge of this research. Numerical simulations of compressor blades under highly negative incidence angles show the complex nature of the flow, with the results used to determine a suitable flow deviation model, a method to extract blade aerodynamic char- acteristics in highly separated flows, and measure the blockage caused by highly separated flow with operating condition and blade geometry. The study also concluded that the use of Blade Element Theory is not accurate enough to be used at such far oﬀ-design con- ditions. The linearised parameter-based whole engine performance solver was converted to used torque-based parameters, which validated against engine test data, shows that it is suitable for low-power simulations with the advantage of having the potential to start engine simulations from static conditions. A study of air-blast atomization at windmilling relight conditions has shown that current established correlations used to predict spray characteristics are not suitable for <b>altitude</b> <b>relight</b> studies, tending to overestimate the atomization quality. Also discovered is the highly influential interaction of compressor wakes with the combustor and atomizer under <b>altitude</b> <b>relight</b> conditions, resulting in more favourable lighting conditions than previous assumptions and models have shown. This is a completely new discovery which will result in a change in the way combustors are designed and sized for relight conditions, and the way combustion rig tests are conducted. The study also has valuable industrial contributions. The locked-rotor numerical data was used within a stage-stacking compressible flow code to estimate the compressor sub- idle map, of which results were used within a whole engine performance solver and results validated against actual engine test data. The atomization studies at relight were used to factor in the insensitivity of current spray correlations, which together with a newly de- veloped sub-idle combustion efficiency sub-routine, are used to determine the combustion efficiency at low-power settings. The interaction of compressor wakes with the atomizer showed that atomizer performance at relight is underestimated, resulting in oversized combustors. By using the knowledge gained within this research, combustor size can be reduced, resulting in lower NOx at take-oﬀ and a smaller and lighter core, with a com- bustor requiring less cooling air. The component research has advanced the knowledge and modelling capability of sub-idle performance solvers, increasing their reliability and encouraging their use for future aero gas turbine engines...|$|E
40|$|The Fuels Properties Task Group {{was charged}} with {{assessing}} the feasibility of using jet fuel with a higher flash point in the civil transport airplane fleet than required by current Jet A/Jet A- 1 Specification, {{as a means of}} reducing the exposure of the fleet to flammable/explosive tank vapors. This report describes the efforts performed by Task Group 6 / 7 for the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) Fuel Tank Harmonization Working Group. Raising the minimum flash point of jet fuel will result in a combination of changes to other fuel properties, such as viscosity. The magnitude of change is dependent on the severity of flash point increase. The engine and APU manufacturers have no experience base for such modified fuels, and are concerned about the risk of adverse impact on <b>altitude</b> <b>relight</b> and low temperature operations (especially Extended Twin Operations, ETOPS). Mitigating actions, including hardware modifications, fuel specification revisions, use of additives and revised operational limits, have also been reviewed. Dependent on magnitude of change, laboratory, rig and/or full-scale engine testing on reference fuels may be required to quantify the impacts. Raising the minimum flash point could also significantly raise the manufacturing cost and decrease the availability of the modified jet fuel. The predicted impact on jet fuel price could be significant. Again, the higher the flash point, the more severe the affect. The fuel impacts are most severe outside of the U. S. because of the differences in overseas refinery configurations and product demand. Some countries indicated that changes in flash point are not viable options to which they would subscribe (Canada...|$|E
