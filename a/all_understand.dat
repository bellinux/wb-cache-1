25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} the scrolls were the product of Jews living in Jerusalem, who hid the scrolls in the caves near Qumran while fleeing from the Romans during the destruction of Jerusalem in 70CE. Karl Heinrich Rengstorf first proposed that the Dead Sea Scrolls originated at the library of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. Later, Norman Golb suggested that the scrolls were the product of multiple libraries in Jerusalem, and not necessarily the Jerusalem Temple library. Proponents of the Jerusalem Origin theory point to the diversity of thought and handwriting among the scrolls as evidence against a Qumran origin of the scrolls. Several archaeologists have also accepted an origin of the scrolls other than Qumran, including Yizhar Hirschfeld and most recently Yizhak Magen and Yuval Peleg, who <b>all</b> <b>understand</b> the remains of Qumran to be those of a Hasmonean fort that was reused during later periods.|$|E
2500|$|The {{death of}} Adrian Gallagher, {{along with the}} {{experiences}} of his father Michael {{and those of other}} families in the Omagh Support and Self Help Group formed the story of the television film Omagh, a Channel 4-RTÃ‰ co-production. Film-maker Paul Greengrass stated [...] "the families of the Omagh Support and Self Help Group have been in the public eye throughout the last five years, pursuing a legal campaign, shortly to come before the courts, with far reaching implications for all of us and it feels the right moment for them to be heard, to bring their story to a wider audience so we can <b>all</b> <b>understand</b> the journey they have made." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kellor, {{speaking}} for the NAC in 1916, proposed to combine efficiency and patriotism in her Americanization programs. It would be more efficient, she argued, once the factory workers could <b>all</b> <b>understand</b> English and therefore better understand orders and avoid accidents. Once Americanized, they would grasp American industrial ideals and be open to American influences and not subject only to strike agitators or foreign propagandists. The result, she argued would transform indifferent and ignorant residents into understanding voters, to make their homes into American homes, and to establish American standards of living throughout the ethnic communities. Ultimately, she argued it would [...] "unite foreign-born and native alike in enthusiastic loyalty to our national ideals of liberty and justice.|$|E

2500|$|The Latin gentile {{adjectives}} {{that belong}} to Hispania are Hispanus, Hispanicus, and Hispanienses. A Hispanus is {{someone who is a}} native of Hispania with no foreign parents, while children born in Hispania of (Latin) Roman parents were Hispaniensis. Hispaniensis means 'connected in some way to Hispania', as in [...] "Exercitus Hispaniensis" [...] ('the Spanish army') or [...] "mercatores Hispanienses" [...] ('Spanish merchants'). Hispanicus implies 'of' or 'belonging to' Hispania or the Hispanus or of their fashion as in [...] "glaudius Hispanicus". The gentile adjectives were not ethnolinguistic but derived primarily on a geographic basis, from the toponym Hispania as the people of Hispania spoke different languages, although Livy said they could <b>all</b> <b>understand</b> each other, not making clear if they spoke dialects of the same language or were polyglots.|$|E
2500|$|Upon his death, Jim Wolpert, {{the head}} of the {{department}} of viticulture and enology at University of California Davis said [...] "The debt of gratitude that we in the research community owe to him is immeasurable. He will be missed in ways that I don't think we <b>all</b> <b>understand</b> yet. There was no question about his reputation. His approach was always a no-nonsense, no-politics approach. He never let the main issues get sidetracked." [...] John De Luca, President of the Wine Institute said [...] "I'm not sure people truly perceive his extraordinary impact on the wine industry. He is one of the defining figures, one of the great figures in wine of our time." [...] Patrick Gleeson, executive director of the American Vineyard Foundation, who Meyer had mentored as a young lad said [...] "His vision and love for wine has undoubtedly made him a living legacy amongst friends, peers and those in the industry. Justin's passing will not diminish the influence he has had on the wine industry and hopefully it will inspire others to follow in his footsteps." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 2008 Democratic Party Platform {{acknowledges}} a [...] "special {{relationship with}} Israel, grounded in shared interests and shared values, and a clear, strong, fundamental {{commitment to the}} security of Israel, our strongest ally in the region and its only established democracy." [...] It also included: It is {{in the best interests of}} all parties, including the United States, that we take an active role to help secure a lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with a democratic, viable Palestinian state dedicated to living in peace and security side by side with the Jewish State of Israel. To do so, we must help Israel identify and strengthen those partners who are truly committed to peace, while isolating those who seek conflict and instability, and stand with Israel against those who seek its destruction. The United States and its Quartet partners should continue to isolate Hamas until it renounces terrorism, recognizes Israel's right to exist, and abides by past agreements. Sustained American leadership for peace and security will require patient efforts and the personal commitment of the President of the United States. The creation of a Palestinian state through final status negotiations, together with an international compensation mechanism, should resolve the issue of Palestinian refugees by allowing them to settle there, rather than in Israel. <b>All</b> <b>understand</b> that it is unrealistic to expect the outcome of final status negotiations to be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949. Jerusalem is and will remain the capital of Israel. The parties have agreed that Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations. It should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths.|$|E
