40|$|Known {{especially}} for his fairy tales, Charles Perrault {{is also the}} author of the Fables de Faërne (1699). In this French translation of the Neo-Latin volume Fabulae Centum (1564), written by the Italian humanist Gabriel Faerno, Perrault had to position himself against his renowned predecessor Jean de La Fontaine, who had been dominating fable literature for decades. Perrault could either imitate his famous example, or evade it, due to anxiety of influence. To illustrate this inner struggle, we systematically compare both authors’ fables, concentrating our <b>analysis</b> on versification (<b>metre</b> and rhyme), vocabulary and apostrophe. In our comparison, we constantly verify whether any of the resemblances could be attributable to other French, versified fable books read by both Perrault and La Fontaine.

40|$|French drains or infiltrating filter drains are {{commonly}} fitted with slotted plastic pipe {{to act as}} an overflow mechanism when rainfall is too great to allow complete infiltration. The release of the effluent from such pipes is commonly to surface water courses. Whilst there is expected to be some slight degree of protection against hydrocarbon release because of interaction with the drain’s stone infill material this will be severely limited. This paper reports an experiment in which model filter drains with or without geotextile sleeves around the slotted drain are challenged with lubricating oil. The textile was a surface-treated non-woven geotextile manufactured from polyester. The models were challenged with very high loadings of oil, as would be anticipated in a motor vehicle collision occurring close to the drain. A series of simulated 10 - 20 mm rain events over 1 hour were applied and two sample types were collected which either included or excluded any free product. Additional aliquots of oil were added at each rain event. The un-sleeved models were found to release visible free product with the addition of as little as 100 ml of oil per linear meter of drain. For the models with geotextile sleeves there was no such release with as much as 2000 ml per linear <b>metre.</b> <b>Analysis</b> showed that under these conditions the geotextile sleeved pipes continued to produce effluent with hydrocarbon concentrations well below the 5000 g/l limit usually accepted in the UK...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, several monographs and {{important}} articles have been devoted to the study of the metre of the R̥gveda (R̥V), but until now little attention has been paid to the metre of the two Atharvaveda Saṃhitās, the Śaunakīyasaṃhitā (ŚS) and the Paippalādasaṃhitā (PS). This dissertation contains a preliminary study of the metre of the Paippalādasaṃhitā (PS) of the Atharvaveda. My research takes as a model the only recent publication on Atharvavedic metre, Kubisch’s study on the metrical and prosodic structures of kāṇḍas 1 - 7 of the Śaunakīyasaṃhitā of the Atharvaveda (Kubisch 2007). This is the first work that provides an analytic study founded on precise statistics of stanzas and verses types. In the Introduction, I sketch the history of the studies in the field of Vedic metre and present the aim and method of my work, which intends to be the “Paippalāda counterpart” of the research made by Kubisch on ŚS 1 - 7. I justify the choice to analyze the eight kāṇḍas of the PS that are already published in critical editions provided with a translation and a commentary; then I explain the method used for my research. At {{the end of the}} Introduction I describe and discuss the verse types that are found in the portions of the PS treated in my dissertation – namely pentad verses, dimeter verses and trimeter verses. An overview of the symbols closes the Introduction. The first chapter of the dissertation presents the metrical restored text of kāṇḍas 2, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 20. 1 - 30 (1940 stanzas and 6244 pādas in total). I prepare a metrical analysis of all the material, describing the prosodic structure, i. e. the sequence of syllables, of each pāda by means of metrical symbols. I assigne to each pāda a designation that contains symbolically encoded information about the number of syllables, the prosodic structure of the text and phenomena such as restoration or omission of syllables. The second chapter deals with the analysis of pāda and mantra types. I elaborate several sets of statistics and discuss the data obtained for each pāda and stanza types, comparing them with the results of Kubisch’s analysis. Two Appendices follow the second chapter. In the first Appendix, I present some issues concerning the internal metrical structure of the PS poetic material. First, I discuss the problem of interpolations in the text of the PS, trying to categorize the different kinds of secondary insertions, then I consider two problems regarding the prosody of the text: traces of laryngeals in the metre of the PS and the distribution of the word pāvaká- in the PS. In the second Appendix, I discuss some other methodological problems, i. e. the legitimacy of applying Van Nooten and Holland’s system to the <b>analysis</b> of Atharvavedic <b>metre,</b> and Knobl’s hypothesis that many alleged irregularities of Vedic metre could be indeed interpreted as a reflection of the poet’s artistic intentions...|$|R
40|$|Wetlands {{have been}} {{severely}} degraded throughout history, particularly by agricultural activities. In addition, legislation {{has played a}} role in the sustainability of this resource. The purpose of this study was to determine the status of wetlands within the Manawatu, requiring an assessment of the physical attributes of the wetland, as well as reviewing the legislation, policies and plans governing how these areas arc managed. The objectives were to determine whether wetlands should be protected, and if so are they adequately preserved within a sample group. The sample group was determined by a number of factors including site access, landowner permission, and time restrictions If it is shown that these wetlands are not in acceptable environmental condition, then details of what should be done to improve their status are included. To achieve these objectives a wetland field assessment sheet that could be used by someone not familiar with the various plant and animal species found around wetlands, was designed. This field assessment sheet assessed the surrounding land use, threats, functions (of the wetland), and assessment of other attributes such as bank stability, water quality, and the effects of humans in the area. This field assessment sheet was necessary in order to determine whether the wetlands in the selected group were adequately preserved. Relevant wetland legislation and planning documents were also assessed. These were used to determine whether wetlands are given adequate protection under current laws such as the Resource Management Act (1991). Aerial photographs at a scale of 1 : 27 500 were used to identify the changes in numbers of wetlands between the 1940 s and 1990 s, and to measure the change in size of the sampled wetlands between the same time period. A main result showed that wetlands are generally increasing in number within four random aerial photo transects. The wetlands that were selected for field assessment proved to be in reasonable environmental condition. Zones within the wetlands that need improvement lie within the amount and composition of bank vegetation surrounding the wetland. In almost all cases, the average width of the surrounding riparian margin was less than five <b>metres.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the legislation and planning documents showed that great emphasis is placed on those wetlands that are identified as being of national or regional significance. Those wetlands that are not classified as such are left to the maintenance of the landowner. Ultimately the status of these wetlands, not identified as being of regional or national significance, lies in the good will of the landowners. In most case studies, landowners were aware and mindful of the wetlands on their property. It is this attitude that must not change if the desired outcome is a continuation of wetlands throughout the region. It is concluded that a regional wetland plan or strategy should be designed in order to give greater importance to those wetlands not identified in the Regional Policy Statement (1998), so their status is more likely to be preserved. This plan should contain encouragement for landowners to provide a more suitable buffer zone around their wetlands - not only for the provision of suitable habitat for wildlife, but also to act as a filter for nutrients entering the wetland system...|$|R
40|$|Teos käsittelee 1800 -luvun suomalaista musiikinhistoriaa kansanmusiikintutkijan näkökulmasta. Kuvauksen päähenkilöinä ovat Kreeta Haapasalo (1813 - 1893) ja Elias Lönnrot (1802 - 1884). Kummankin elämästä, muusikkoudesta ja merkityksestä esitetään perustelliseen tutkimukseen perustuva uusi tulkinta. Haapasalo oli määrätietoinen talonpoikaistaiteilija, laulaja ja kanteleensoittaja, joka kiersi neljäkymmentä vuotta ympäri maata esiintyen aluksi herrasväen hoveissa, sittemmin markkinoilla ja lopuksi uutta aikakautta edustavilla laulujuhlilla. Lönnrot osoittautuu intohimoiseksi muusikoksi, jolla oli monia suurisuuntaisia musiikillisia hankkeita. Molempien vaiheet ja elämäntyö nähdään murroksen ennakointina, ennen kaikkea sääty-yhteiskunnan murenemisen ennusteena. Kumpikin liikkui herrasväen ja rahvaan välissä. Suomenkielistä kansakuntaa ja kulttuuria synnytettiin. Kanteleella oli keskeinen asema kummankin elämässä. Haapasalon ja Lönnrotin ansiosta kantele sopeutui uuteen aikaan: soitin suureni ja kielimäärä lisääntyi. Haapasalo rakennutti esiintymismatkojaan varten yhä suurempia talonpoikaiskanteleita. Hänen aikanaan valmistuivat kanteleen {{historian}} suurimmat soittimet. Lönnrot teki viisikielisestä kanteleesta kansallissoittimen. Hänen merkillisin musiikillinen hankkeensa oli kuitenkin kromaattisen suurkanteleen kehittäminen. Lönnrot suunnitteli monia kantelemalleja ja suositteli kanteletta koulusoittimeksi. Kantelehankkeissaan Lönnrot oli todella edellä aikaansa. Teoksen keskeinen tutkimuskohde on myös metriikka, laulun runomitta. Ensimmäistä kertaa on analysoitu uudemman kansanlaulun säkeistörakenteita. Aineistona on yli viisituhatta hengellisen ja maallisen kansanlaulun arkistomuistiinpanoa. Satojen säkeistörakenteiden joukosta kohoaa parikymmentä säkeistötyyppiä muita selvästi yleisemmiksi. Esille nousee muistinvaraisuuden vaikutus laulun rakenteisiin. Tätä kautta rekilaulusta syntyy uudenlainen näkemys. Rekimitta osoittautuu luultua monipuolisemmaksi ja dynaamisemmaksi laulunteon välineeksi. Ilmaisullisesti se on kalevalamitan veroinen. Yhdessä kalevalamitta ja rekimitta muodostavat muistinvaraisen suomenkielisen laulun suuren linjan. Koska lähdeaineisto on hyvin puutteellista eikä vastaa nykyajan kysymyksiin, nousee tärkeäksi tutkimusmenetelmäksi tutkijan musisoiminen. Historiallisen kansanmusiikin rakenteita ja estetiikkaa on paljon helpompi tutkia ja ymmärtää, kun itse soittaa ja laulaa. Päämääränä on "kulttuurin moniäänisyyden, monimerkityksisyyden ja moniselitteisyyden säilyttämisen tavoittelu". Journeys {{into music}} in 19 th century Finland My dissertation comprises five articles, all discussing {{the history of}} 19 th century Finnish music. I approach this history {{from the point of}} view of a folk music researcher. The cultural and social transition which began in the early 19 th century also brought about the most radical change in the history of Finnish folk music. The era of historical folk music, as well as its aesthetics, drew to a close. In the new society, folk music acquired new forms and meanings. In my articles I concentrate on the time before the transition. The main characters in my description are Kreeta Haapasalo (1813 - 1893) and Elias Lönnrot (1802 - 1884). Haapasalo was a well-known vernacular artist, singer and kantele player, touring the country for four decades, performing first to an exclusive upper-class audience, and later to wider audiences. Haapasalo sang newer folk songs, which had verses. Lönnrot collected older rune songs and compiled them into the Finnish national epic Kalevala (1835, second extended edition 1849) and Kanteletar (1840). Both Haapasalo and Lönnrot experienced a transition and its consequences towards the end of their lives. Both became celebrated heroes. Haapasalo represented folk culture to the folk themselves, while Lönnrot was seen as the father of Finnish-language culture. Their lives and work can be seen as laying the foundations for the upcoming transition, especially the crumbling of the old class society. Both Haapasalo and Lönnrot moved in between the upper class and the common people. It was the time of building a Finnish culture and nation. The article "Torpparinvaimo Greeta Haapasalon matkat" ['The travels of Greeta Haapasalo, crofter's wife'] tells the life story of Kreeta Haapasalo. She was born in Kaustinen, central Ostrobothnia. In January 1853, she performed in Helsinki, the capital of Finland for the first time. The central biographical source materials were the newspapers of the time, as they showed keen interest in Haapasalo's performances and tours. Lönnrot's Kalevala and Kanteletar made the kantele the national instrument of Finland. The old kantele had, however, only 5 [...] 10 strings, and was, therefore, unsuitable for playing music of the new era. The kantele, however, survived through the 19 th century musical transition: it grew bigger and the number of strings increased to over thirty. Thanks to this development, the kantele has a firm foothold in the contemporary Finnish culture. Haapasalo was one of the leading reformers of the kantele. For her performances, she had ever bigger kanteles made by rural instrument builders. The article "Elias Lönnrot ja musiikki" [Elias Lönnrot and music] introduces a forgotten part of the national epic writer's work. Lönnrot was also a singer, flautist, and kantele player. He transcribed and published folk songs, and was also a music theorist. Lönnrot also contributed to the development of the kantele: his greatest invention in the field of music is the chromatic kantele. Lönnrot developed several kantele models and proposed that it be adopted as a school instrument. In his kantele projects, Lönnrot was far ahead of his time. The article "Jo lähti pois pakenemaan" [So it fled away] describes the 19 th century dispute over poetic metres and Lönnrot's role in it. The unusual trochaic metre of Kalevala became especially important to Lönnrot. He demanded this metre be used in all Finnish poetry. Lönnrot served as an example, he translated and wrote countless hymns over a period of thirty years to be proposed for the new edition of the hymn book. Despite his tireless fight, Lönnrot lost this campaign. The article "Runo, mitta, musiikki" [Poem, metre, music] is an <b>analysis</b> of the <b>metres</b> of 19 th century folk songs. The shift from rune singing to folk songs with verses was the most significant change in the history of Finnish-language song tradition. How should the verse structures be analysed? After a number of experiments, I settled for analysis based on sung songs. Previously, folk song metres have mainly been studied as recited poems. I analyse the metre by dividing a verse into lines, taking into account three parameters: the length of the line, its beginning and end. Through these three factors I describe the verse structures identified in the analysis. The material consists of more than five thousand archive records of folk songs. Included are both religious and secular songs. Amongst hundreds of verse structures, some twenty salient types of verses emerge as the most common. "Oma perinne vieraana kulttuurina" [One's own tradition is a foreign culture] discusses studying 19 th century historical folk music through the existing source material, focusing on the theory on the autonomous aesthetics of peasant music. The theory emphasises the class society's division into two separate cultures. The two cultures existed side by side, not in historical succession, neither were they subordinate to each other, and they remained independent. They did, however, constantly influence each other. Good examples of this influence on a practical level are Kreeta Haapasalo and Elias Lönnrot. As the source material is insufficient and fails to answer some of the questions raised in our time, more focus must be placed on the researcher's music making as research method. Studying and understanding the structures and aesthetics of historical folk music is much easier for those who can play and sing the music...|$|R
