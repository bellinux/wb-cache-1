40|$|The authors {{emphasize}} the versatility of the pectoralis major myo-cutaneous flap in {{head and neck}} reconstruction. They describe the vascular anatomy of the flap after dissection and catheterization of the deep pectoral branch of the <b>acromio-thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> in twenty cadavers. They {{emphasize the}} consistency {{and the size of}} this artery and describe a rich and regular network of perforating myo-cutaneous arteries. These allow a high versatility {{in the size of the}} cutaneous area. The use of this flap to cover carcinologic or post-radiotherapic defect is indicated because it brings a richly vascularized muscular tissue. The arc rotation of the flap is very large and permits reconstructions in axillary, thoracic and facial area. A "S" superior incision save the possibility of using a homolateral delto-pectoralis cutaneous flap. The authors present five typical clinical applications of this flap...|$|E
