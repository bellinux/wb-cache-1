30|$|What is the {{contribution}} of this paper, relative to the existing literature? To {{the best of our}} knowledge, we are the first who analyze this relationship for the recent economic crisis with a direct measure for the magnitude of automatic stabilizers and up-to-date data on fiscal stimulus packages. The (IMF 2009), using the average ratio of revenue to GDP as an indirect measure for <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilization,</b> finds a negative relationship between government size {{and the size of the}} discretionary fiscal impulse 2. Moreover, as their work was done at an early stage in the recession, they rely on projections for discretionary measures (see IMF (2009)). However, in (Dolls et al. 2012), we show that simple macro measures such as the tax revenue to GDP ratio only partially predict the amount of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilization.</b> In a similar vein, the (OECD 2009) finds an inverse relationship between the size of fiscal packages and automatic stabilizers, but also uses projections for fiscal stimulus and a measure for <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilization</b> which is conceptually not comparable to ours as it is based on the cyclical sensitivity of the budget to the economic cycle (see Girouard and André 2005).|$|R

Our results go sharply contrary to this view. We engage in an empirical analysis of 21 OECD countries from 1982 to 2003 and find that age- and health-related social expenditure as well as incapacity and sick benefits all react to the cycle in a stabilizing manner. While possibly new in the macro literature, this conforms to many results in studies in labour economics.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to test the {{mechanism}} of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilization</b> between the dynamics of real GDP-growth and budget deficit by using structural VAR methodology with quarterly macroeconomic data of Moroccan economy. The SVAR model allows us to test and evaluate the extent of those mechanisms. It exhibits also the conjunctural and structural components of budget deficit. From a methodological point of view, we avoid to impose long run constraints to adopt simple and efficient approach linking the short-term parameters. The empirical results show that the mechanisms of automatic stabilizing are checked in our sample. The historical decomposition permits us to determine the orientation of budget policy. This decomposition shows that since the finance crisis in 1983 the government respects in tendency a budgetary rule in the sense that the observed balance reflects <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilization</b> measures both of transitory and permanent nature. ...|$|R

30|$|A further {{concern in}} the policy debate put forward by {{supporters}} of large and coordinated discretionary measures was that countries could limit {{the size of their}} programs at the expense of countries with more generous fiscal policy responses. The central factor behind this hypothesis is the degree of openness of an economy. The more open an economy is, i.e. the stronger the economic ties with other countries are, {{the more likely it is}} that a country gains from other countries’ fiscal stimulus packages or, conversely, the more likely it is that own fiscal stimulus measures spill over to other countries. Hence, the idea behind this argument is that some countries might show a free-rider behavior and profit from spill-over effects of discretionary measures 15. We find only weak evidence for this hypothesis. While the correlation between discretionary measures passed in 2008 - 2009 and trade openness is negative which is confirmed when we estimate a univariate regression between these two 16, the coefficient on openness becomes insignificant once our measure for <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilization</b> is included as can be seen in column (6) of Table 1. This is due to the fact that the correlation between openness and <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilization</b> is positive. All in all, our results suggest that policymakers did take into account the forces of automatic stabilizers when designing active fiscal policy measures to tackle the recent economic crisis.|$|R
