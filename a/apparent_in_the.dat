5|$|Although {{freshwater}} invertebrates inhabiting and comprising {{algae and}} periphyton make {{the foundation of}} food webs {{in the middle and}} lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding {{on the bottom of the}} river and ocean floors. The abundance and importance of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) is <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> many middens left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high. Oysters and other mollusks serve as the primary food source of shorebirds. The large trees that line the river from its source to south of Jacksonville begin to transition into salt marshes east of the city. Mayport is home to approximately 20 shrimping vessels that use the mouth of the St. Johns to access the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Features of the He 111 were <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Heinkel He 70.

In the normal four-passenger version its speed reached 380km/h (230mph) when powered by a 447kW (600hp) BMW VI engine. The He 70 was designed with an elliptical wing, which the Günther brothers had already incorporated into the Bäumer Sausewind before they joined Heinkel. This wing design became a feature in this and many subsequent designs they developed. The He 70 drew {{the interest of the}} Luftwaffe, which was looking for an aircraft with both bomber and transport capabilities.|$|E

5|$|Henry was {{allegedly}} buried in Nousiainen, from where his bones—or at least {{something that was}} thought to be his bones—were transported to Turku in 1300. In addition to traditions, the only source connecting Nousiainen to early bishops is a letter signed by Bishop Thomas in Nousiainen in 1234. Archaeological excavations of pre-Catholic cemeteries in Nousiainen and surrounding parishes show a clear discontinuation of traditions in the early 13th century, but no abrupt changes are <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> religious environment among the 12th century finds.|$|E
5|$|Settlement on the Mendip Hills {{appears to}} fall into two types. The first, <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain periods, and {{repeated}} {{on a small scale}} in the Middle Ages and post-medieval era, comprised occupation by self-sufficient groups in small communities or isolated farms. The second was represented in the Iron Age Britain and Roman periods by large sites with specialist functions, existing by virtue of their ability to exert power over lowland producers. From the Iron Age onward the ownership of land took on increasing importance, with large landholdings based on the mines or on stock grazing, denying settlers access to the plateau or forcing them off the hills.|$|E
5|$|The land walls {{run through}} the heart of modern Istanbul, with a belt of parkland {{flanking}} their course. They are pierced at intervals by modern roads leading westwards out of the city. Many sections were restored during the 1980s, with financial support from UNESCO, but the restoration program has been criticized for destroying historical evidence, focusing on superficial restoration, the use of inappropriate materials and poor quality of work. This became <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1999 earthquakes, when the restored sections collapsed while the original structure underneath remained intact. The threat posed by urban pollution, and the lack of a comprehensive restoration effort, prompted the World Monuments Fund to include them on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world.|$|E

The stylistic stone door of Lou Rui's tomb of 570 closely resembles that of Tang stone doors, such as the one in Li Xian's tomb.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} von Stroheim used {{grotesque}} imagery and characters. This is most <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wedding-banquet scene, {{which includes a}} midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on crutches. The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal like animals. This scene was unlike any other in films of that period, which treated meals with dignity {{and a sense of}} communion. Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and a garbage truck driving by as they kiss.|$|E
5|$|Between the Acts of Union in the mid-16th {{century and}} the English Civil War in the mid-17th century, a period of great {{rebuilding}} {{took place in the}} Kingdom of England, of which Wales was now annexed, and this is reflected in the structures that were built within the Rhondda Valley. The fluctuating economic state of the late Tudor period resulted in farmers taking in more land, creating higher levels of surplus goods and therefore producing higher profits. This profit was reflected in the new farm houses built in the Rhondda {{and for the first time}} an emphasis on domestic comfort became <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> design of the dwellings. Many of the new farm buildings were simple structures consisting of two or three small rooms, though of a much sturdier and permanent quality than the Medieval platform houses. A popular style of building was the long-house, a building which combined the house and cowshed into a single building. By 1840, at least 160 farms existed in the Rhondda, but most were destroyed with the growth of the mining industry. Of the few surviving buildings, those of note include Tynewydd ('New House') in Blaenrhondda, a 17th-century house thought to have given its name to the neighbouring village of Tynewydd and Tyntyle in Ystrad dated around 1600.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E
5|$|The large {{diversity}} of the flora around Adams is even more <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> herbage and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is {{more than any other}} mountain in the Pacific Northwest. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by William Suksdorf and Thomas Howell and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts. This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed. Adams is home to many rare plants including tall bugbane, Suksdorf’s monkeyflower, northern microseris (Microceris borealis), Brewer’s potentilla (Potentilla breweri), and mountain blue-eyed grass. The plant diversity is most evident in the many meadows and wetlands on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, magenta paintbrush, arrowleaf ragwort, penstemons, lupines, monkeyflowers, mountain heathers, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find bog blueberry, highbush cranberry, sundew, purple cinquefoil, and flatleaf bladderwort, in addition to many sedges and rushes. Subalpine and alpine meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a beautiful display as well with partrigefoot, Cascade rockcress, subalpine buttercup, Sitka valerian, alpine false candytuft, elegant Jacob’s ladder, and various buckwheats as prominent players.|$|E
5|$|The prose play Edwards Dream (Eduards Traum) was {{released}} in 1891, composed of several small grouped episodes, rather than one linear storyline. The work received mixed reception. Joseph Kraus felt it was the peak of Busch's life's work, his nephews called it a masterwork of world literature, and the publisher of a critical collective edition spoke of a narrative style that is not found in contemporary literature. Eva Weissweiler saw in the play Busch's attempt to prove himself in the novella genre, believing that everything that angered or insulted him, and his accompanying emotional depths, are <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> story. The 1895 story The Butterfly (Der Schmetterling) parodies themes and motifs and ridicules the religious optimism of a German romanticism which contradicted Busch's realistic anthropology influenced by Schopenhauer and Charles Darwin. Its prose is more stringent in narrative style compared to Edwards Dream. Both were not popular amongst readers, because of their unfamiliar style.|$|E

5|$|This {{change is}} <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{writings}} of the Hoysala court poets, some of who are noted for pioneering works in native metres. The Veerashiava poet Harihara, {{one of the most}} prominent poets of the medieval era, established the ragale tradition with his biography of Basavanna (Basavaraja Devara ragale, 1160), the earliest available biography of the social reformer and of the Kannada language as well. His nephew Raghavanka established the shatpadi metre in his unique and original narration of the story of King Harishchandra called Harishchandra Kavya (1200). Sisumayana is credited with introducing a new composition called sangatya (1232) in his allegorical poems Tripuradahana ("Burning of the triple fortress") and Anjanacharita. Some Jain authors continued the champu tradition, such as Janna, immortalised by his writing Yashodhara Charite (1207), a unique set of stories in 310 verses dealing with sadomasochism and transmigration of the soul. The earliest well-known Brahmin writers also emerged during the late 12th century and wrote on themes ranging from Vaishnava faith (Rudrabhatta's Jagannatha Vijaya, 1185) to secular treatises on poetics (Kavi Kama's Sringara Ratnakara, on poetic sentiment and flavor).|$|E
