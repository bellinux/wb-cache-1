40|$|This paper aims {{to discuss}} the {{description}} of <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> within ethnomathematics from a contemporaneous point of view, without separating describer from <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> described. For that, instead of looking for mathematics in <b>a</b> <b>practice,</b> we defend the idea of describing <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> mathematically. Besides that, we point out {{what would be the}} ethnomathematics reasercher role within this vision, and a methodological path based on Alangui’s Mutual Interrogation methodology...|$|R
40|$|The author {{investigates the}} role of {{constitutive}} rules {{in the construction of}} social reality. He denies that constitutive rules are a sufficient condition of <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> such as <b>a</b> chess game. To create <b>a</b> new <b>practice</b> with rules, it is necessary that there already be the grammar of this practice, that is, the sense of this practice (for example, the sense of game). It is the grammar of <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> and not its constitutive rules that determines the nature of <b>a</b> <b>practice.</b> The sense of <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> cannot be created by constitutive rules...|$|R
30|$|All five {{primary care}} {{practice}} factors (total number of GPs, number of male GPs, {{number of female}} GPs, practice list size and number of patients referred from <b>a</b> <b>practice)</b> are correlated with each other (0.202 – 0.832, P ≤  0.01). The number of GPs within <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> is correlated weakly with the WIMD overall (0.120, P ≤  0.01) and WIMD health (0.112, P ≤  0.01). This shows that as levels of deprivation decrease, the number of GPs in <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> increase. The number of patients referred from <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> is correlated with the WIMD overall (0.169, P ≤  0.01), such that as deprivation decreases, so {{the number of patients}} referred from <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> increases.|$|R

40|$|This article {{opens up}} space to {{challenge}} state-centrism {{about human rights}} practice. To do so, it presents and critically assesses four methods {{that can be used}} to determine who and/or what counts as a part of any international practice: the agreement method, which locates <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> by referring to speech acts that define it; the contextual method, which locates <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> by referring to the actions, meanings, and intentions of practitioners; the value method, which locates <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> by identifying <b>a</b> value or principle that the practice reflects or instantiates; and the purpose method, which locates <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> by constructing <b>an</b> account of the sociopolitical reason(s) for <b>a</b> <b>practice’s</b> existence. The purpose method, based on an interpretation of Rawls’ constructivism, is developed, in a way that focuses on practitioners’ judgement-based reasons to assign responsibility for human rights to any state or non-state actor...|$|R

5000|$|Best <b>practice</b> is <b>a</b> form {{of program}} {{evaluation}} in public policy. It {{is the process}} of reviewing policy alternatives that have been effective in addressing similar issues in the past and could be applied to a current problem. Determining best <b>practices</b> to address <b>a</b> particular policy problem is a commonly used but little understood tool of analysis because the concept is vague and should therefore be examined with caution. Vagueness stems from the term [...] "best" [...] which is subjective. While some research and evidence must go into determining <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> the [...] "best" [...] it is more helpful to simply determine if <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> has worked exceptionally well and why. Instead of it being [...] "the best", <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> might simply be <b>a</b> smart <b>practice,</b> <b>a</b> good <b>practice,</b> or <b>a</b> promising <b>practice.</b> This allows for a mix and match approach for making recommendations that might encompass pieces of many good practices.|$|R

5|$|According to {{at least}} one account, Bogdan-Pitești was educated in Geneva, at a local Catholic institution. Raised in the Romanian Orthodox faith, he {{converted}} to Catholicism in his twenties, but was no longer <b>a</b> <b>practicing</b> Catholic by the time of his death. He supposedly attended medical school at the University of Montpellier, without ever graduating, and afterwards left to join the bohemian milieu of Paris. He may have enrolled at the University of Paris, studying Law and Letters, but probably withdrew after a short while. Art historian Sanda Miller recounts that Bogdan-Pitești attended the École des Beaux-Arts in the French capital, but that he was ultimately expelled. Other sources express doubt that the Romanian aristocrat was ever affiliated with any university or college, in either France or Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Duke, Nixon {{initially}} hoped {{to join the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation. He received no response to his letter of application and learned years later {{that he had been}} hired, but his appointment had been canceled at the last minute due to budget cuts. Instead, he returned to California and was admitted to the bar in 1937. He began practicing with the law firm Wingert and Bewley in Whittier, working on commercial litigation for local petroleum companies and other corporate matters, as well as on wills. In later years, Nixon proudly stated that he was the only modern president to have previously worked as <b>a</b> <b>practicing</b> attorney. Nixon was reluctant to work on divorce cases, disliking frank sexual talk from women. In 1938, he opened up his own branch of Wingert and Bewley in La Habra, California, and became a full partner in the firm the following year.|$|E

40|$|Senior seminar (D. V. M.) [...] Cornell University, 2001. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 10). When senior veterinary {{students say}} {{that they want to}} own <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> one day, do they really know what they are talking about? Most students have no idea what owning <b>a</b> veterinary <b>practice</b> is like. Two credits of <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> management class do not quite make these students MBA material. Are these budding entrepreneurs truly prepared to operate a small business? The decision to buy <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> should not be taken lightly. Owning <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> is <b>a</b> life-changing commitment [...] not something to "try out" for a couple of years. Often ignored are the downsides of practice ownership, including: increased responsibility, increased stress, interrupted vacations, and time taken away from a veterinarian's true specialty [...] medicine. It should be obvious that ownership is not for everybody. Some veterinarians will simply be much happier as associates. Yet, the pot of gold {{at the end of the}} rainbow is sometimes difficult to resist. Future and recent grads who are set on owning <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> need to evaluate themselves and their lives in order to determine when and if practice ownership is right for them. Can you buy <b>a</b> <b>practice?</b> Should you buy <b>a</b> <b>practice?</b> These are two very different questions, and they both deserve careful thought. What this self-evaluation amounts to is a seemingly endless series of questions. There are no right or wrong answers, per se, just answers that may suggest one career option over another. Do you have what it takes? Ask yourself the following questions, and judge your responses. It should be obvious how responses differ between entrepreneurs and couch potatoes...|$|R

Garfield detailed that the preparation with Martin included extensive research and immersion in the Jesuit lifestyle and frame of mind which was felt to be essential to the accuracy of the film by the producers. Garfield, who is of slight to medium frame, reported losing 40 pounds to play the role following the rules of abstention which were outlined to him by Martin.|$|E
5|$|Brodie died {{nine months}} before {{publication}} of the book. As death neared, the cancer spread to her brain and bones, and Brodie experienced intense pain. During this period, she was visited in the hospital by her brother Thomas, who had remained <b>a</b> <b>practicing</b> Latter-day Saint. Brodie asked him to “give me a blessing,” although she had long been estranged from both her brother and the LDS Church. A few days later, Brodie released a note saying that her request for a priesthood blessing should not be misinterpreted as a request {{to return to the}} Church. It was Brodie’s last signed statement. In accordance with her wishes, friends spread her ashes over the Santa Monica Mountains, which she loved and had successfully helped to protect from real estate development.|$|E
5|$|Charles' {{choices were}} appropriate. Philip was {{culturally}} Spanish: {{he was born}} in Valladolid and raised in the Spanish court, his native tongue was Spanish, and he preferred to live in Spain. Ferdinand was familiar with, and to, the other princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Although he too had been born in Spain, he had administered his brother's affairs in the Empire since 1531. Some historians maintain Ferdinand had also been touched by the reformed philosophies, and was probably the closest the Holy Roman Empire ever came to a Protestant emperor; he remained at least nominally a Catholic throughout his life, although reportedly he refused last rites on his deathbed. Other historians maintain that while Ferdinand was <b>a</b> <b>practicing</b> Catholic, unlike his brother he considered religion to be outside the political sphere.|$|E

5|$|Cisneros {{grew up in}} a well-off {{ranching}} {{family from}} Los Indios, Texas, and was married to David Cisneros, a surgeon from Brownsville. They had five children. She was a well-respected volunteer in the local medical community, and was president of the southern chapter of the Cameron-Willacy Counties Medical Society. The association where she volunteered helped raise funds for medical scholarships. In addition, people close to Cisneros said she was <b>a</b> <b>practicing</b> Catholic and that she cared a lot for her family. She volunteered at St. Joe, and was well-liked in the social group she was part of. Since Los Indios was mostly a ranching community close to the U.S.-Mexico border, Cisneros's religiosity was heavily influenced by curanderismo, a practice of religious and folk medicine healing rooted in ancient Mexican culture.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, Cleburne and Hindman {{were both}} wounded by gunshots during a street fight in Helena {{with members of}} the Know-Nothing Party {{following}} a debate. Cleburne was shot in the back, turned around and shot one of his attackers, killing him. The attackers hid until Cleburne collapsed on the street and then left. After the two recovered, they appeared before a grand jury to respond to all charges brought against them. They were exonerated and, afterward, went to Hindman's parents' house in Mississippi. By 1860, he was a naturalized citizen, <b>a</b> <b>practicing</b> lawyer, and very popular with the local residents.|$|E

To support herself and her surviving son, Ellen opened a boarding house for seamen. Then she sent her son away for further schooling at a Moravian academy in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. Although he was {{for all of his}} life <b>a</b> <b>practicing</b> Catholic, he had only praise for the education he received at the academy. After about three years, his mother could no longer afford to pay his tuition, so in 1829 his schooling ended and he returned home.|$|E
