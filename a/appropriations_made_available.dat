Since {{the implementation of the}} BEA, emergency supplemental appropriations have been granted in a variety of situations, from droughts to wars and earthquakes to riots. Most recently, <b>appropriations</b> were <b>made</b> <b>available</b> in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States.

Once the <b>appropriations</b> have been <b>made</b> <b>available,</b> the Commission concludes {{an agreement with the}} beneficiary State and makes a grant.

2500|$|The Foundation {{said that}} the government's call for a {{distinction}} to [...] "be recognized between appropriations for 'Congressional programs' and 'general budget appropriations' made to fund executive operations", was not recognized conceptually or legally. They said the government had cited [...] "no decision that recognizes such a distinction between Congressional appropriation bills, nor is the distinction between Congressional appropriation bills, nor is the distinction provided with any conceptual plausibility." [...] They said [...] "The Constitution does not distinguish between Congressional <b>appropriations</b> <b>made</b> to administrative 'spending programs' and Congressional budget <b>appropriations</b> <b>made</b> to the executive branch. All appropriations require Congressional legislative action. The Congressional 'power of the purse' refers to this exclusive power of Congress to appropriate funds, which power derives from specific provisions of the Constitution, including Article I, § 8, which empowers Congress to 'pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of the United States.' The Appropriations Clause, Article I, § 9, Cl. 7, further provides that 'no Money shall {{be drawn from the}} Treasury, but in Consequence of <b>Appropriations</b> <b>made</b> by Law.'" ...|$|R

[...] They said the government was trying to [...] "distinguish between general budget <b>appropriations</b> <b>made</b> by Congress and tax <b>appropriations</b> <b>made</b> to specific 'spending programs.'" [...] They said such a claim of distinction [...] "is not based upon any principle of differential responsibility or culpability by Congress in making appropriations that are allegedly misused." [...] They held {{that the government was}} urging the Court to accept the idea of distinction because of [...] "a belief that the executive branch should be able to use Congressional tax appropriations without accountability under the Establishment Clause." ...|$|R
