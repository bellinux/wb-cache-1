The results showed that the degree of intensity and the sowing area of the land use in China during 1980 - 2000 had a total trend to increase, but there were three times to decline. And when the degree of intensity declined obviously during the period of 1984 - 1986, 1992 - 1993 and 1997 - 1999, the sowing area of the crop shrank evidently and the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> began to increase notably almost in the same time.

40|$|The {{decline of}} agriculture, {{observable}} mainly in industrialized countries, shows itself {{not only in}} a gradual decrease in the economic weight of the primary sector, {{but also in the}} abandonment of land devoted to agricultural and livestock activities. The phenomenon of agricultural land abandonment is complex and, in order to explain the causes, it is necessary to consider not only the physical and productive features of the land but also the social and economic characteristics of the area. It also appears to be conditioned by production specialization, since traditional livestock-raising areas show a higher risk of abandonment. The process, which is gradual, starts with a reduction in production intensity followed by increasing marginalization and, finally, the total <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>use.</b> Focusing on a representative area on the Cantabrian Coast of northern Spain, this study tests the hypothesis that a large portion of agricultural land in livestock-oriented regions is underused.

40|$|Intensification or <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> {{agricultural}} <b>land</b> <b>use</b> {{has led to}} {{a severe}} decline of semi-natural habitats across Europe. This can cause immediate loss of species but also time-delayed extinctions, known as the extinction debt. In a pan-European study of 147 fragmented grassland remnants, we found differences in the extinction debt of species from different trophic levels. Present-day species richness of long-lived vascular plant specialists was better explained by past than current landscape patterns, indicating an extinction debt. In contrast, short-lived butterfly specialists showed no evidence for an extinction debt at a time scale of c. 40 years. Our results indicate that management strategies maintaining the status quo of fragmented habitats are insufficient, as time-delayed extinctions and associated co-extinctions will lead to further biodiversity loss in the future...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was to}} compile the current characteristics of the vegetation in intermittently wet Molinia meadows and to identify changes that occurred within 25 years. The analysed meadow stands comprised 129 species of vascular plants. The relevés showed the presence of 17 - 50 species (on average 36). The characteristic species exhibited high abundance and high degrees of constancy. In total, 16 characteristic species of the alliance Molinion were recorded. Molinia caerulea, Galium boreale, and Sanguisorba officinalis were the dominant species in a majority of the analysed stands. The average number of species occurring in the purple moor-grass meadows in Kostrze is currently higher than 25 years ago (an increase from 28 to 36). The list of characteristic species has not changed substantially (three new species were noted: Betonica officinalis, Carex tomentosa, and Ophioglossum vulgatum), and the differences in the floristic composition are mainly related to sporadic species. <b>Abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> triggered succession and a decline in the surface area of the analysed meadows.

40|$|Cultural landscapes are {{appreciated}} for {{the plethora}} of ecosystem services that they provide to society. They are, however, subject to rapid and fundamental transformations across Europe, mainly as a result <b>of</b> intensification or <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses.</b> Our objective is to assess the possible future drivers of cultural landscape changes and their likely impacts on ecosystem services provision as perceived by local actors. We present stakeholder-based scenarios for the Swabian Alb, a biosphere reserve in southern Germany, projected to the yr 2040. On their basis, we explore the possibilities and limitations of local civil engagement for landscape conservation and development {{in the face of}} increasing global influences. The steps of the process are (a) identifying the key driving forces of landscape change, (b) developing contrasting narratives about alternative landscape futures, (c) refining the narratives, (d) discussing scenario impacts, and (e) exploring local management strategies. Four contrasting scenarios created by the stakeholders are presented. Global-level drivers are state support/regulations vs. free-market economy, and energy-intensive lifestyles vs. low-energy economy. Local-level forces are high vs. low consumer demand for localized food, and high vs. low appreciation of local cultural landscapes. Outcomes show that cultural landscape development may come to a crossroads over the next 30 yrs, with either combined land abandonment and landscape industrialization scenarios or multifunctional, locally distinct landscape futures being possible. The scenario narratives envision that the most powerful way to develop and protect distinct landscapes is to foster local people&# 039;s links to cultural landscapes, to build social capital around them, and to direct consumption patterns toward localized food production. We find that participatory scenario processes have strengths in terms of the credibility, transferability, and confirmability of the insights gained, but are often weak in ensuring dependability...|$|R

The test site is a French Alpine protected area, which like many other mountain areas is characterised by a general increase of forest and woody vegetation due to the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>land</b> <b>use</b> practices. Two Landsat images of the years 1984 and 2000 were used and a classification scheme nomenclature based on four vegetation change classes, implying a gradual modification <b>of</b> <b>land</b> cover, was adopted. The accuracy of the change map was assessed both during two visits {{on the field and}} using a bi-temporal aerial photographic coverage. A sampling scheme specifically conceived for change detection products was adopted. Error matrices and accuracy indices to assess commission and omission errors of the change maps were generated. The proposed change detection methodology circumvents limitations which are intrinsic to traditional classification procedures based only on spectral information. On the basis of the accuracy assessment, overall accuracy was 90. 1 % and the increase of woody vegetation {{turned out to be the}} vegetation change class better estimated, with user and producer accuracies of, respectively, 62. 3 % and 70 %. However, confusion between the no change and the other vegetation change classes was noticed, due to standard problems encountered in change studies.

40|$|International audienceIn Europe, the Quaternary is {{characterized}} by climatic fluctuations known to have led to many cycles of contraction and expansion of species geographical ranges. In addition, during the Holocene, historical changes in human occupation such as colonization or <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> can also affect habitats. These climatically or anthropically induced geographic range changes are expected to produce considerable effective population size change, measurable in terms of genetic diversity and organization. The rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) is a small-bodied grouse occurring throughout Northern hemispheric arctic and alpine tundra. This species is not considered threatened at a continental scale, but the populations in the Pyrenees are of concern because of their small population size, geographical isolation and low genetic diversity. Here, we used 11 microsatellites to investigate genetic variations and differentiations and infer the overall demographic history of Pyrenean rock ptarmigan populations. The low genetic variability found in these populations has been previously {{thought to be the}} result of a bottleneck that occurred following the last glacial maximum (i. e., 10 [*] 000 years ago) or more recently (i. e., during the last 200 years). Our results clearly indicate a major bottleneck affecting the populations in the last tenth of the Holocene. We discuss how this decline can be explained by a combination of unfavorable and successive events that increased the degree of habitat fragmentation.

40|$|<b>Abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> areas {{established}} in cleared old growth forests can generate secondary forest succession resulting in secondary growth forests. Because of its importance in providing ecological benefits, such as biomass accumulation and reducing landscape fragmentation, specially when long-term growth is allowed, mapping stages of secondary growth became {{key in the}} Amazon region to better understanding land use and land cover change processes. Landsat imagery is the most largely used imagery for that purpose due to its adequate spatial resolution, spectral response and historic availability. However, {{a few studies have}} assessed the spectral characteristics of secondary growth using a long chronosequence (i. e., > 25 years) combined with forest transects and rigorous statistical analysis. The objectives of this study are: i) evaluate whether secondary growth age classes can be discriminated in Landsat images and ii) define the best set of spectral features that allow the discrimination of secondary growth. To do that, we used statistical tests to compare reflectance images and the vegetation index NDVI. The statistical analysis showed that it was possible distinguish primary forest from most age classes of secondary growth using one or a combination of spectral features evaluated in this study. These results hold promises to use Landsat imagery spectral features to characterize biophysical properties of secondary growth, and to map age classes. More advanced techniques such as spectral mixture models may also improve the spectral separability of second growth age classes and are being investigated by our research group.

This paper provides detailed information {{on the number of}} exclusive, rare, or threatened vascular plants living on these islands and islets. Focusing on the 18 most-investigated islets, we evaluate the extent to which species richness, rate of endemism, number of alien plants, and number of terrestrial habitats have been influenced by 1) geographical setting, 2) geological history, 3) geo-pedological variability, 4) bioclimate, 5) number and patchiness of local plant communities, and 6) natural and human disturbance history and regime. Special attention is directed to the rarefaction and extinction of many interesting species that live or have lived only on these islands. Rarefaction and extinction are mostly linked to the increase in anthropogenic disturbance, which have caused the destruction, degradation, and/or fragmentation of many plant communities and especially those associated with rocky or sandy shores and temporary ponds. Interestingly, in some cases extinction has resulted from a reduction in certain human activities. For example, many noteworthy species are disappearing with the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> that created low-impact agro-ecosystems, new microhabitats (e. g., stone walls), and open semi-natural habitats (including vineyards, cereal crops, olive groves, and fallows subject to extensive grazing).

40|$|Soil {{erosion and}} {{sediment}} yield are strongly affected by land use/land cover (LULC). Spatially distributed erosion models are {{of great interest}} to assess the expected effect of LULC changes on soil erosion and sediment yield. However, they can only be applied if spatially distributed data is available for their calibration. In this study the soil erosion and sediment delivery model WATEM/SEDEM was applied to a small (2. 84 km 2 ) experimental catchment in the Central Spanish Pyrenees. Model calibration was performed based on a dataset of soil redistribution rates derived from point 137 Cs inventories, allowing capture differences per <b>land</b> <b>use</b> in the main model parameters. Model calibration showed a good convergence to a global optimum in the parameter space, which was not possible to attain if only external (not spatially distributed) sediment yield data were available.

Two LULC scenarios were then modeled to reproduce <b>land</b> <b>use</b> {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century and a hypothetic future scenario, and to compare the simulation results to the current LULC situation.

In this study a spatially explicit approach, combining aerial photographs, geographical information systems and land cover metrics, was used to assess long-term landscape dynamics over a 50 -year period.

40|$|Resilience against fire {{disturbance}} of Mediterranean vegetation has been frequently described. However, due to climatic change and <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> local <b>land</b> <b>use</b> practices, the fire regime is changing, probably leading to higher intensities and frequencies of disturbance events. The forthcoming scenario {{calls for a}} full understanding of post-disturbance tree recruitment processes, structural resilience and possible consequences on the overall forest biodiversity. In particular, knowledge on severe crown fires’ effects on forest stand structural attributes needs to be further explored. In this work, we describe and quantify fire impact and short-term response of a Mediterranean forest affected by high severity crown fires, focusing on the compositional and structural diversity of living and dead trees, spatial pattern of fire-induced mortality, recovery dynamics of tree species. The analysis, based on a synchronic approach, was carried out within four burned and two not burned fully stem-mapped research plots located in NW Italy, belonging to two forest categories differing for their main tree restoration strategies. Distance-dependent and distance-independent indices were applied to assess structural diversity dynamics over time since fire occurrence. Within the analyzed forests fire was found to affect mostly forest structure rather than its composition. Number of snags largely increases immediately after the fire, but it levels off due to their fall dynamics. Regeneration strategies and fire severity influenced species abundance and consequently diversity patterns. Stem diameter and height diversity were modified as well, with a strong increase in the first post-fire year and a sharp reduction six years after the disturbance. Fire determined also a higher heterogeneity in crown cover and vertical structure. Spatial patterns of surviving trees and snags were greatly affected by fire, producing an increase in aggregation and segregation mechanisms. Autosuccessional processes are supposed to preserve current forest structure and composition, but the ecosystem self-restoring capability should be analyzed {{in the light of the}} possible changes in fire regime...|$|R

These changes were often attended by the process <b>of</b> agricultural <b>abandonment.</b> This paper presents an approach to the evaluation <b>of</b> agricultural <b>abandonment</b> by analysis <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> change in chosen terrain attributes (slope levels and altitude levels) context.

40|$|Dynamic {{processes}} can {{be classified}} {{in terms of their}} time scale, their spatial scale, the elements observed, and the degree of human impact. Using these categories the regeneration of the tree layer, the regeneration of the herb layer as well as successional changes of supraregional importance (immissions, global change) are discussed. A virgin (mixed) European beech forest consists of a mosaic of sub-stands that can be typified by their structure and developmental stage (phase) of the tree layer; in some phases the tree individuals of each sub-stand are rather even-aged. Natural cyclic regeneration of virgin (mixed) European beech forests mainly includes the tree species of the terminal phases, expecially the beech itself. Changes of tree species composition within the cycle are the exception; in European beech forests light-demanding pioneers seem to be restricted to rather small patches under natural conditions. In contrast, the sequence (1) felled-area flora, (2) pioneer shrub/pioneer forest and (3) terminal forest is a characteristic feature of managed deciduous forests as a consequence of soil disturbances. During the cyclic regeneration of the tree layer of European beech forests the floristic content of the ground layer vegetation does not change fundamentally. Regeneration of many of the ground layer species of beech forests via generative diaspores is more or less restricted to micro-disturbances. In contrast disturbance of the topsoil and creation of open habitats for the establishment of saplings in the absence of competition is taking place all over a clear-cutting area. European beech forests are subject to changes of floristic structure caused by immissions. Especially nitrogen, emitted over decades in large quantities, causes a successive change in floristics: species requiring high amounts of nitrogen are increasing in beech forests all over Europe. Most of them are rapidly and tall growing species, outcompeting the slower and smaller growing acid-indicators. Soil acidification, although taking place, is therefore often not reflected in changes in the vegetation cover. Up to now, syntaxonomic changes are usually restricted to the levels below the association. Additionally some proportion of (beech) forest stands are presently changing since the regeneration following the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> degrading <b>land</b> <b>use</b> practices has not yet been completed. As a consequence of changing climatic conditions (CO 2 -content, air temperature, precipitation, storms) it is expected that European beech forests will change in the future. However, details of the floristic structure of future beech forest communities can not be predicted. Nevertheless, according to present knowledge, beech forests will remain the most important natural forests in Europe during the next century...|$|R

40|$|Salinity is {{a problem}} of {{irrigation}} agriculture and is recognized as a serious threat to crop production in the Western States. All water used for irrigation, whether diverted from surface stream or pumped from wells, contains dissolved salts in amounts varying from a few hundred pounds to several tons per acre-foot (8, 23). Salts accumulating in the root zone of the soil, as water is removed by crop and by surface evaporation eventually, may restrict crop yields. Extensive areas <b>of</b> <b>land</b> in the Western States, which were at one time productive under irrigation, have been abandoned because of the development of saline or alkali conditions (15, 23). This outright <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>lands</b> not only materially reduce total crop production but increases the burden on lands that are productive, by way of increased taxes, and per-acre cost of reclamation and construction. Depreciated land values and unfavorable social and economic changes often result. In addition to losses from <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>lands</b> resulting from intense saline or alkali conditions, there are losses from reduced crop yields caused by lesser degrees of salinity. The latter go unrecognized and unheeded over large areas <b>of</b> irrigated <b>land.</b> It has been estimated that such losses may amount to as much as 10 to 25 percent (13) ...|$|R

40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important threats to biodiversity. Plant populations are confined to very small habitat fragments in a hostile landscape matrix resulting in small population sizes. Orchids are very environmentally demanding, making them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in <b>land</b> <b>use</b> and the consequences of habitat fragmentation. Orchid species often depend on a specific pollinating genus for pollination, which makes them extremely vulnerable to disruptions of plant-pollinator interactions by habitat fragmentation. Also, many orchid species attract pollinators by deceit, and dont provide a floral reward. This can be expected to influence mating patterns and gene flow. Our general objective was to determine the viability of fragmented orchid populations, both of a rewarding (Gymnadenia conopsea) as well as a rewardless orchid species (Orchis mascula). The study area is the valley of the river Viroin, 75 km to the south of Brussels. Since the second half of the 19 th century, <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> the traditional <b>land</b> <b>use</b> has resulted in the loss of large areas of calcareous grassland. Moreover, the remaining grasslands are often small and spatially isolated. In a subset of populations we studied the relationship between the fitness of the populations and fragmentation characteristics for both species. We also measured microvariation in the surrounding environment, to test whether the viability of orchid populations is influenced by environmental characteristics. For G. conopsea, the effects of habitat fragmentation where quantified throughout a six year period. Next, we also calculated population genetic variables based on AFLP markers for a subset of populations of O. mascula and we quantified between and within population gene flow in this subset of populations through performing a full parentage analysis. We also evaluated three common techniques to assess reproductive success in orchids (embryo counting, tetrazolium test, in vitro germination). Finally, an extensive account on the ecology of the rewarding species G. conopsea was provided. Reproductive success of G. conopsea and O. mascula was not significantly influenced by environmental characteristics. Percentage fruit set was positively related to population size in G. conopsea, but no such effect was observed in O. mascula. On the other hand, seed viability in G. conopsea remained low, irrespective of population size, while a large population size positively influenced seed viability in O. mascula. Our results also suggest that in large populations where pollinators are expected to be more abundant, percentage fruit set increases in the rewarding G. conopsea, but at the same time, geitonogamous pollination reduces seed viability in these populations. Seed viability of the rewardless O. mascula seems to benefit from increased pollinator availability in larger populations, whereas the low percentages of fruit set in O. mascula in large populations may be explained by the relatively low attractiveness of rewardless orchid species for pollinators. Connectivity did not influence reproductive success of O. mascula. For G. conopsea, on the contrary, the isolation-effect varied among years, most likely due to the influence of varying weather conditions on the behaviour of its pollinators. Fragmented populations of O. mascula were not strongly genetically differentiated from each other and the exchange of alleles between populations occurs mostly through pollen flow, whereas seed dispersal was limited to the first few meters from the mother plant. The results of the three most often applied methods to measure reproductive success in orchids (embryo counting, tetrazolium test and in vitro germination) were not correlated to each other. The counting is the easiest procedure, although it overestimates the seed viability in comparison with the tetrazolium test and germination experiments. The results from the tetrazolium test overestimated viability as compared to the germination experiment. Based on the results in this PhD work, we can conclude that both rewarding G. conopsea and rewardless O. mascula suffer from the detrimental consequences of habitat fragmentation, each in their specific manner. As far as conservation management is concerned, each species requires a different approach. Increasing connectivity will sustain benefits for the rewarding species, and increasing population size will be particularly beneficial for the rewardless species. nrpages: 201 status: publishe...|$|R

We present an overview <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>abandonment,</b> its driving forces and its consequences for landscape, biodiversity and humans. A descriptive meta-analysis of independently published studies highlighted {{the fact that the}} <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> agri-cultural <b>land</b> is a phenomenon mostly driven by socio-economic factors such as immigration into areas where new economic opportunities are offered to rural people. Ecological drivers such as elevation and land mismanagement leading to soil erosion are of secondary importance.

In order of decreasing importance, they were biodiversity loss, increase of fire frequency and intensity, soil erosion and desertification, loss of cultural and/or aesthetic values, reduction of landscape diversity and reduction of water provision. The impacts of these problems were not equally relevant in all regions of the world. The <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>land</b> may also benefit humans.
