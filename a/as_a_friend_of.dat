5|$|Although {{the case}} was filed in the Western District of Wisconsin, the judge there recused himself <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> the magazine. The case was {{therefore}} brought before Judge Robert W. Warren, a judge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Because of the sensitive nature of information {{at stake in the}} trial, two separate hearings were conducted, one in public, and the other in camera. The defendants, Morland and the editors of The Progressive, would not accept security clearances, which would put restraints on their free speech, and so were not present at the in camera hearings. Their lawyers did obtain clearances so that they could participate, but were forbidden from conveying anything they heard there to their clients.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the few}} {{surviving}} sources contemporary {{with the}} rule of Tiberius comes from Velleius Paterculus, who served under Tiberius for eight years (from AD4) in Germany and Pannonia as praefect of cavalry and legatus. Paterculus' Compendium of Roman History spans a period from the fall of Troy {{to the death of}} Livia in AD29. His text on Tiberius lavishes praise on both the emperor and Sejanus. How much of this is due to genuine admiration or prudence remains an open question, but it has been conjectured that he was put to death in AD31 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|Phaedrus was {{suspected}} of having alluded to Sejanus in his Fables and received some unknown punishment short of death (Cf. Fables I.1, I.2.24, and I.17). Velleius Paterculus was a historian and contemporary of Sejanus, whose two-volume The Roman History details a history of Rome from the fall of Troy until the death of Livia Augusta in AD 29. In his work he praised Tiberius and Sejanus, even defending the latter's high position in the government, despite not ranking higher than equestrian. How much of Paterculus' writing is due to genuine admiration, prudence or fear remains an open question, {{but it has been}} conjectured that he was put to death <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|After {{depositing}} {{his family}} in a London hotel, the Claimant called at Lady Tichborne's address and was told she was in Paris.

On 29 December the Claimant visited Alresford and stayed at the Swan Hotel, where the landlord detected a resemblance to the Tichbornes.

5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{attempts}} to make everyone's Christmas wishes come true.

An emotionally confused Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) tries {{to be nice to}} Jessica, but ends up drinking too much at the party.

Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) does her part <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> Erin's by being mean to Jessica. Andy becomes concerned about Erin's behavior, not least because Robert California (James Spader) has revealed that his marriage is ending, spends {{a good deal of the}} party hanging out with Erin and pressures her into drinking shots. When Andy has to drive a drunken Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) home, he sees Erin getting into Robert's car and he follows them with a look of panic on his face.

5|$|Both the Puranas and the Ramayana {{feature the}} half-blood {{siblings}} of Kubera. Vishrava, Kubera's father, also married the Rakshasa (demon) princess Kaikesi, who mothered four Rakshasa children: Ravana, the chief antagonist of the Ramayana, Kumbhakarna, Vibhishana and Soorpanaka. The Mahabharata regards Vishrava as {{the brother of}} Kubera, so Kubera is described as the uncle of Ravana and his siblings. It records that when Kubera approached Brahma for the favour of superseding his father Pulastya, Pulastya created Vishrava. To seek the favour of Vishrava, Kubera sent three women to him, by whom Vishrava begot his demon children. Ravana, after acquiring a boon of Brahma, drove Kubera away from Lanka and seized his Pushpaka Vimana, which was returned to Kubera after Ravana's death. Kubera then settled on Gandhamandana mountain, near Mount Kailash — the cosmological abode of the god Shiva—in the Himalayas. Sometimes, Kailash itself is called Kubera's residence. His city is usually called Alaka or Alaka-puri ("curl-city"), but also Prabha ("splendour"), Vasudhara ("bejeweled") and Vasu-sthali ("abode of treasures"). There, Kubera had a grove called Caitraratha, where the leaves were jewels and the fruits were girls of heaven. There is also a charming lake called Nalini in the grove. Kubera is often described <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> Shiva in the epics. The Padma Purana says that Kubera prayed to Shiva for many years, and Shiva granted him the kingship of Yakshas.|$|E
