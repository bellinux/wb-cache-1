5|$|The {{long-term}} use of supplemental vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D or vitamin E does not {{reduce the risk}} of lung cancer. Some studies suggest that people who eat diets with a higher proportion of vegetables and fruit tend to have a lower risk, but {{this may be due to}} confoundingâ€”with the lower risk actually due to the association of a high fruit/vegetables diet with less smoking. Several rigorous studies have not demonstrated a clear association between diet and lung cancer risk, although meta-analysis that accounts for smoking status may show benefit from <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>diet.</b>|$|E

Close follow-up is often necessary. Antibiotics are prescribed for infections, and various medications can help with itching. Laxatives, such as lactulose, decrease the risk of constipation; their role in preventing encephalopathy is limited.|$|E

25|$|The Alliance for Natural Health (ANH) is an {{advocacy}} group founded in 2002 by Robert Verkerk and based in the United Kingdom. The ANH was initially founded to raise funds to finance a legal challenge of the EU Food Supplement Directive. The ANH lobbies against regulation of dietary supplements and in favor of alternative medical approaches such as homeopathy, and also advocates <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>diet,</b> exercise, and other lifestyle approaches to health. Verkerk rejects scientific research showing that megadoses of vitamins lack any health benefit.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>diet.</b> Cognitive behavioral therapy {{may also be}} helpful. The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While fibromyalgia can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage.|$|E

Because some {{of the causes of}} memory loss include medications, stress, depression, heart disease, alcohol abuse, thyroid problems, vitamin B12 deficiency, not drinking enough water, and not eating nutritiously, fixing those problems could be a simple, effective way to slow down dementia.

25|$|The {{disease is}} {{diagnosed}} by biopsy done by an endoscope (a fiberoptic camera). Prevention includes stopping smoking and eating <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>diet.</b> Treatment {{is based on}} the cancer's stage and location, together with the person's general condition and individual preferences. Small localized squamous-cell cancers may be treated with surgery alone with the hope of a cure. In most other cases, chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy is used along with surgery. Larger tumors may have their growth slowed with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In the presence of extensive disease or if the affected person is not fit enough to undergo surgery, palliative care is often recommended.|$|E
25|$|While <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>diet</b> is beneficial, {{the effect}} of {{antioxidant}} supplementation (vitamin E, vitamin C, etc.) or vitamins has not been shown to protect against cardiovascular disease {{and in some cases}} may possibly result in harm. Mineral supplements have also not been found to be useful. Niacin, a type of vitamin B3, may be an exception with a modest decrease in the risk of cardiovascular events in those at high risk. Magnesium supplementation lowers high blood pressure in a dose dependent manner. Magnesium therapy is recommended for people with ventricular arrhythmia associated with torsades de pointes who present with long QT syndrome {{as well as for the}} treatment of people with digoxin intoxication-induced arrhythmias. There is no evidence to support omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.|$|E
