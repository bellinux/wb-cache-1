5|$|The UN {{units were}} able to defeat and repel the North Koreans repeatedly, {{including}} through a coordinated offensive <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> perimeter.

5|$|The new {{government}} sought {{to appease the}} protesters by reopening the border with Czechoslovakia. This, however, merely resulted in the resumption of the mass exodus through Hungary via Czechoslovakia. On 8November 1989, with huge demonstrations continuing <b>across</b> <b>the</b> country, <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Politbüro resigned and a new, more moderate Politbüro was appointed under Krenz's continued leadership.|$|R

50|$|Unlike SMPS-type devices, {{multiple}} charging is {{an inherent}} issue <b>across</b> almost <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> size range of EAS-type devices. Accurate {{characterization of the}} electrical charging of the aerosol is therefore {{an essential component of}} device design.|$|R
5|$|The {{order was}} given {{and the group}} formed up <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> street, from curb to curb. They fixed bayonets and advanced. Shots were fired at the troops, but they {{successfully}} moved {{through the crowd and}} into the station.|$|E
5|$|As the 108th Infantry Regiment was {{responsible}} for the right sector of the divisional defence, this meant that the 42nd Infantry Regiment, which was originally responsible only for the left sector, had to extend <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> divisional frontage. During the night, the commander of the divisional cavalry battalion sent patrols towards the German bridgehead, but local Ustaše sympathisers misled them into believing the Germans were already across the Drava at Barcs in strength. The Germans were subsequently able to consolidate their bridgehead at Barcs overnight.|$|E
5|$|By 1956, Sanders had six {{or eight}} franchisees, {{including}} Dave Thomas, who eventually founded the Wendy's restaurant chain. Thomas developed the rotating red bucket sign, was an early advocate of the take-out concept that Harman had pioneered, and introduced a bookkeeping form that Sanders rolled out <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> KFC chain. Thomas sold his shares in 1968 for US$1 million (around US$7 million in 2013), and became regional manager for all KFC restaurants east of the Mississippi before founding Wendy's in 1969.|$|E

5|$|By January 1943, the {{situation}} looked {{very good for}} the Soviet side. The German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad had weakened the German front. The Soviet forces were planning or conducting offensive operations <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> front, especially in southwestern Russia. Amidst these conditions, Operation Iskra was {{to become the first}} of several offensive operations aimed at inflicting a decisive defeat on the German Army Group North.|$|E
5|$|During the {{streaming}} of the series, Silverman {{criticized the}} animation {{because of the}} low lighting levels that might {{make it hard to}} understand. Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator noted the series' high budget and praised the animation style and the focus on details and technology. She was attracted by its premise and expected the quality to remain consistent <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> series. Similarly, Jacob Hope Chapman from ANN praised the animation for its high quality. Episode 18, which is known for its flawed animation, was improved for the home media release of the series.|$|E
5|$|In {{the table}} above, genitive pronouns all end with -gin, which is {{separated}} orthographically by a hyphen that normally divides morphemes. The -gin form {{here is not}} a separate morpheme and cannot be lexically segmented; {{there is no such}} word as nganing that would be formed by removing -gin from nganing-gin 'my/mine'. The fact that the genitive forms have regular endings <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> pronoun paradigm may have been a historical accident.|$|E
50|$|Research led by David Walsh of the Glasgow Centre for Population Health in 2010 {{concluded}} that the deprivation profiles of Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester are almost identical, but premature deaths in Glasgow are over 30 percent higher, and all deaths around 15 percent higher, <b>across</b> almost <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> population.|$|R
50|$|The {{throughput}} is kept high {{by using}} high quantum efficiency CCDs. There is also only one grating, a high transmission volume phase holographic grating.

5|$|Massey and Brown {{introduced}} standardization to the fragmented company. After visiting Pete Harman's {{operations in}} Utah, {{they began to}} implement the stand-alone take-out model <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> chain. Franchisees were ordered to delist their own menu items {{so that they could}} concentrate on KFC products. The restaurants were re-branded with a distinctive red-and-white striped color pattern and mansard roofs with cupolas. The roll-out of freestanding stores accelerated the company's growth as outlets exclusively selling fried chicken proved to be more appealing to potential franchisees.|$|E

5|$|Northern England has a cool, wet {{oceanic climate}} with small areas of subpolar oceanic climate in the uplands. Averaged <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> region, Northern England is cooler, wetter and cloudier than England as a whole, and {{contains}} both England's coldest point (Cross Fell) and its rainiest point (Seathwaite Fell). Its temperature range and sunshine duration {{is similar to}} the UK average and it sees substantially less rain than Scotland or Wales. These averages disguise considerable variation across the region, due chiefly to the upland regions and adjacent seas.|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} {{intensive}} {{changes in the}} landscape over the last 250 years. The landscape has changed continuously from a natural landscape, determined only by the physical-geographical conditions of the area, to an agricultural landscape.

5|$|Overall wages rose {{much more}} slowly {{throughout}} the period than planned: wages <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> state (not only industrial wages) rose by 22.9 percent between 1959 and 1965, against a plan for growth of 26 percent. Wage rises during the reform were made up for by increases in industrial productivity.

5|$|Radio {{broadcasts}} {{remain the}} principal {{means by which}} the Malagasy population access international, national and local news.

Hundreds of public and private stations with local or regional range provide alternatives to state broadcasting. In addition to the state television channel, a variety of privately owned television stations broadcast local and international programming throughout Madagascar. Several media outlets are owned by political partisans or politicians themselves, including the media groups MBS (owned by Ravalomanana) and Viva (owned by Rajoelina), contributing to political polarization in reporting.|$|E
5|$|The {{gear and}} dial {{in the bottom}} left of the game screen {{is related to the}} Kotarou's Rewrite ability. The dial moves forward {{whenever}} this ability is used, and the outcome of certain scenes is determined by how much the dial has moved. Throughout most of the game, the text is presented in a dialog box on the lower portion of the game screen, but this is changed for the Terra scenario, where the text is overlaid <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> screen.|$|E
50|$|QuarkCopyDesk offers three viewing modes: Story, Galley and WYSIWYG. The Story mode {{displays}} <b>the</b> story text <b>across</b> <b>the</b> screen's <b>entire</b> width without formatting.
