40|$|Sodium <b>azumolene</b> {{is a drug}} {{designed}} to fight Malignant Hyperthermia (MH), which is characterized by genetic predisposition and triggered {{by the use of}} inhalational anesthetics. This drug is shown as a water-soluble analogue of dantrolene sodium, 30 -folds more water soluble, which gives advantages for its emergency use. To our knowledge there is no analytical method for sodium zaumolene raw material or dosage form published so far. The objective of the present investigation was to develop and validate analytical methods to achieve sodium <b>azumolene</b> chemical identification and quantification. The sodium <b>azumolene</b> was characterized regarding its thermal behavior, by differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis; Visible, UV and infrared absorption. To accurately assess the sodium <b>Azumolene</b> content three different analytical methods (visible and UV spectrophotometry and high performance liquid chromatography) were developed and validated. All methods showed to be linear, accurate, precise and reliable. <b>Azumolene</b> has shown to be equipotent to dantrolene in the treatment and prevention of an MH crisis and the great advantage compared to dantrolene is better water solubility. This study has characterized the sodium <b>azumolene</b> and presents new analytical methods which have not been reported so far...|$|E
40|$|The flux {{of calcium}} forms an {{important}} intracellular messenger system. The bcl- 2 oncoprotein {{is thought to}} make cells resistant {{to a variety of}} insults, including cytotoxic drugs, by the suppression of apoptosis, which appears to involve the repartitioning of intracellular calcium. Three drugs that affect calcium pathways and may influence this repartitioning, i. e. dantrolene, <b>azumolene</b> (a water-soluble dantrolene analogue) and nimodipine, were studied in cell culture, using both a transformed follicle centre lymphoma cell line and primary culture of lymphoma cells in vitro in a manner that resulted in a growth pattern closely resembling that of the malignancy in vivo. Dantrolene and <b>azumolene</b> were potent inducers of cell death in both systems reducing the viable cell count by 70 - 90 % in comparison with normal controls. Nimodipine, in comparison, appeared to have no significant effect. These results obtained in an in vitro setting suggest that further evaluation of dantrolene and <b>azumolene</b> for the treatment of low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is warranted...|$|E
40|$|Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) {{channels}} play {{an important}} role in Ca(2 +) signaling. Recently, excessive SOCE was proposed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of malignant hyperthermia (MH), a pharmacogenic disorder of skeletal muscle. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing SOCE current (ISkCRAC) magnitude, voltage dependence, and rate of activation in myotubes derived from two mouse models of anesthetic- and heat-induced sudden death: 1) type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR 1) knock-in mice (Y 524 S/+) and 2) calsequestrin 1 and 2 double knock-out (dCasq-null) mice. ISkCRAC voltage dependence and magnitude at - 80 mV were not significantly different in myotubes derived from wild type (WT), Y 524 S/+ and dCasq-null mice. However, the rate of ISkCRAC activation upon repetitive depolarization was significantly faster at room temperature in myotubes from Y 524 S/+ and dCasq-null mice. In addition, the maximum rate of ISkCRAC activation in dCasq-null myotubes was also faster than WT at more physiological temperatures (35 - 37 °C). <b>Azumolene</b> (50 µM), a more water-soluble analog of dantrolene that is used to reverse MH crises, failed to alter ISkCRAC density or rate of activation. Together, these results indicate that while an increased rate of ISkCRAC activation is a common characteristic of myotubes derived from Y 524 S/+ and dCasq-null mice and that the protective effects of <b>azumolene</b> are not due to a direct inhibition of SOCE channels...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStore-operated Ca 2 + entry (SOCE) {{contributes}} to Ca 2 + handling in normal skeletal muscle function, {{as well as}} the progression of muscular dystrophy and sarcopenia, yet the mechanisms underlying the change in SOCE in these states remain unclear. Previously we showed that calsequestrin- 1 (CSQ 1) participated in retrograde regulation of SOCE in cultured skeletal myotubes. In this study, we used small-hairpin RNA to determine whether knockdown of CSQ 1 in adult mouse skeletal muscle can influence SOCE activity and muscle function. Small-hairpin RNA against CSQ 1 was introduced into flexor digitorum brevis muscles using electroporation. Transfected fibers were isolated for SOCE measurements using the Mn 2 + fluorescence-quenching method. At room temperature, the SOCE induced by submaximal depletion of the SR Ca 2 + store was significantly enhanced in CSQ 1 -knockdown muscle fibers. When temperature of the bathing solution was increased to 39 °C, CSQ 1 -knockdown muscle fibers displayed a significant increase in Ca 2 + permeability across the surface membrane likely via the SOCE pathway, and a corresponding elevation in cytosolic Ca 2 + as compared to control fibers. Preincubation with <b>azumolene,</b> an analog of dantrolene used for the treatment of malignant hyperthermia (MH), suppressed the elevated SOCE in CSQ 1 -knockdown fibers. Because the CSQ 1 -knockout mice develop similar MH phenotypes, this inhibitory effect of <b>azumolene</b> on SOCE suggests that elevated extracellular Ca 2 + entry in skeletal muscle may be a key factor for the pathophysiological changes in intracellular Ca 2 + signaling in MH...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} (MV) is a life-saving {{intervention for}} patients in respiratory failure. However, prolonged MV causes the rapid development of diaphragm muscle atrophy, and diaphragmatic weakness {{may contribute to}} difficult weaning from MV. Therefore, developing a therapeutic countermeasure to protect against MV-induced diaphragmatic atrophy is important. MV-induced diaphragm atrophy is due, at least in part, to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from diaphragm mitochondria and the activation of key muscle proteases (i. e., calpain and caspase- 3). In this regard, leakage of calcium through the ryanodine receptor (RyR 1) in diaphragm muscle fibers during MV could result in increased mitochondrial ROS emission, protease activation, and diaphragm atrophy. Therefore, these experiments tested the hypothesis that a pharmacological blockade of the RyR 1 in diaphragm fibers with <b>azumolene</b> (AZ) would prevent MV-induced increases in mitochondrial ROS production, protease activation, and diaphragmatic atrophy. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 12 hours of full-support MV while receiving either AZ or vehicle. At {{the end of the}} experiment, mitochondrial ROS emission, protease activation, and fiber cross-sectional area were determined in diaphragm muscle fibers. Decreases in muscle force production following MV indicate that the diaphragm took up a sufficient quantity of AZ to block calcium release through the RyR 1. However, our findings reveal that AZ treatment did not prevent the MV-induced increase in mitochondrial ROS emission or protease activation in the diaphragm. Importantly, AZ treatment did not prevent MV-induced diaphragm fiber atrophy. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of the RyR 1 in diaphragm muscle fibers is not sufficient to prevent MV-induced diaphragm atrophy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mutations in the ryanodine type 1 {{receptor}} (RyR 1) are causative for malignant hyperthermia. Studies {{in human}} B lymphocytes {{have shown that}} measurement of RyR 1 -mediated intracellular Ca 2 + (Ca 2 +i) release can differentiate between normal and malignant hyperthermia-susceptible individuals. The authors have further developed the B-cell assay by pharmacologically characterizing RyR 1 -mediated Ca 2 + release in two normal human B-cell lines and demonstrating increased sensitivity of lymphocytes to the RyR 1 agonist 4 -chloro-m-cresol (4 -CmC) in the porcine model of MH. Methods: Ca 2 +i was measured fluorometrically using fura- 2 in populations of cells in suspension or with fluo- 4 in single cells using confocal microscopy. The Dakiki and PP normal human B cell lines were used, as well as lymphocytes obtained from normal and malignant hyperthermia-susceptible pigs. 4 -CmC was used to elicit RyR 1 -mediated Ca 2 + release; all experiments were performed {{in the absence of}} external Ca 2 +. Results: EC 50 values for 4 -CmC were 0. 98 and 1. 04 mm for Dakiki and PP cells, respectively, demonstrating reproducibility. The 4 -CmC-induced increase in Ca 2 +i was eliminated by thapsigargin and was unaffected by xestospongin C. The Ca 2 +i increase was separable from mitochondrial stores and was inhibited by <b>azumolene.</b> Caffeine did not induce Ca 2 + i release, but ryanodine depleted intracellular stores by 50 %. Lymphocytes from pigs carrying the Arg 614 Cys mutation in RyR 1 showed increased sensitivity to 4 -CmC (EC 50 = 3 D 0. 47 vs. 0. 81 mm for cells derived from normal animals). Conclusions: RyR 1 -mediated Ca 2 + signals can be pharmacologically distinguished from other intracellular sources in human B cells, and alterations of RyR 1 function can be successfully detected using Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores as an end point...|$|E
40|$|Dantrolene {{inhibits}} and ryanodine stimulates calcium {{release from}} skeletal-muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), the former {{by an unknown}} mechanism, and the latter by activating the ryanodine receptor (RyR), the primary Ca 2 +-release channel of SR. Dantrolene is used to treat malignant hyperthermia (MH), a genetic predisposition to excessive intracellular Ca 2 + release upon exposure to volatile anaesthetics. Porcine MH results from a point mutation in the SR RyR that alters the open probability of the channel, and is reflected in altered [3 H]ryanodine binding parameters. Specific binding sites for [3 H]dantrolene and [3 H]ryanodine co-distribute on SR that has been isolated by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation. If the two drug-binding sites are functionally linked, [3 H]dantrolene binding might be affected both by pharmacological and by genetic modulators of the functional state of the RyR. Accordingly, we compared the characteristics of [3 H]dantrolene binding to porcine malignant-hyperthermia-susceptible and normal-skeletal-muscle SR, and {{examined the effects of}} RyR modulators on [3 H]dantrolene binding to these membranes. Additionally, the feasibility of separating the SR binding sites for [3 H]dantrolene and [3 H]ryanodine was investigated. No significant differences in [3 H]dantrolene binding characteristics to SR membranes from the two muscle types were detected, and the Bmax ratio for [3 H]dantrolene/[3 H]ryanodine was 1. 4 (+/- 0. 1) : 1 in both muscle types. [3 H]Dantrolene binding is unaffected by the RyR modulators caffeine, ryanodine, Ruthenium Red and calmodulin, and neither dantrolene nor <b>azumolene</b> have any effect on [3 H]ryanodine binding. Additionally, distinct peaks of [3 H]dantrolene and [3 H]ryanodine binding are detected in SR membranes fractionated by linear sucrose centrifugation, although no differences in protein patterns are detected by SDS/PAGE or Western-blot analysis. We suggest that the binding sites for these two drugs are pharmacologically distinct, and may exist on separate molecules...|$|E
