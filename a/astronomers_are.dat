5|$|The precise {{origins of}} the Kuiper belt and its complex {{structure}} are still unclear, and <b>astronomers</b> <b>are</b> awaiting the completion of several wide-field survey telescopes such as Pan-STARRS and the future LSST, which should reveal many currently unknown KBOs.

5|$|Matter falling onto {{a compact}} object {{is one of}} the most {{efficient}} mechanisms for releasing energy in the form of radiation, and matter falling onto black holes is thought to be responsible for some of the brightest astronomical phenomena imaginable. Notable examples of great interest to <b>astronomers</b> <b>are</b> quasars and other types of active galactic nuclei. Under the right conditions, falling matter accumulating around a black hole can lead to the formation of jets, in which focused beams of matter are flung away into space at speeds near that of light.|$|E

5|$|One {{definition}} of a sub-brown dwarf is a planet-mass object that formed through cloud collapse rather than accretion. This formation distinction between a sub-brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon; <b>astronomers</b> <b>are</b> divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet {{as part of its}} division in classification. One reason for the dissent is that often it may not be possible to determine the formation process. For example, a planet formed by accretion around a star may get ejected from the system to become free-floating, and likewise a sub-brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star.|$|E

25|$|The planet Uranus has {{a system}} of rings {{intermediate}} in complexity between the more extensive set around Saturn and the simpler systems around Jupiter and Neptune. The rings of Uranus were discovered on March 10, 1977, by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Douglas J. Mink. More than 200 years ago, William Herschel also reported observing rings, but modern <b>astronomers</b> <b>are</b> skeptical that he could actually have noticed them, as they are very dark and faint.|$|E
25|$|M94, also {{classified}} as NGC 4736, is a face-on spiral galaxy 15 million light-years from Earth. It has very tight spiral arms {{and a bright}} core. The outskirts of the galaxy are incredibly luminous in the ultraviolet because of a ring of new stars surrounding the core, 7,000 light-years in diameter. Though <b>astronomers</b> <b>are</b> not sure what has caused this ring of new stars, some hypothesize that it is from shock waves caused by a bar that is thus far invisible.|$|E
25|$|Breakthroughs in telescope, {{detector}} {{and computer}} technology now allow astronomical surveys to produce {{large numbers of}} images, spectra and catalogues. These data sets cover the sky at all wavelengths, from gamma- and X-rays through optical, infrared and radio waves. <b>Astronomers</b> <b>are</b> developing {{ways to make the}} large amount of data easily accessible. These techniques use the grid paradigm of distributed computing with seamless, transparent access to data through virtual observatories (VOs). As a physical observatory has telescopes with unique astronomical instruments, a VO consists of data centres with unique collections of astronomical data, software systems and processing capabilities. This global, community-based initiative is being developed under the International Virtual Observatory Alliance and in Europe as part of the EURO-VO project.|$|E

500|$|The {{rings of}} Uranus are {{a system of}} rings around the planet Uranus, {{intermediate}} in complexity between the more extensive set around Saturn and the simpler systems around Jupiter and Neptune. The rings of Uranus were discovered on March 10, 1977, by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Jessica Mink.

500|$|On 12 February 1991, at a {{distance}} of [...] from the Sun, Halley displayed an outburst that lasted for several months, releasing a cloud of dust 300,000km across. The outburst likely started in December 1990, and then the comet brightened from magnitude 24.3 to magnitude 18.9. Halley was most recently observed in 2003 by three of the Very Large Telescopes at Paranal, Chile, when Halley's magnitude was 28.2. The telescopes observed Halley, at the faintest and farthest any comet has ever been imaged, in order to verify a method for finding very faint trans-Neptunian objects. <b>Astronomers</b> <b>are</b> now able to observe the comet at any point in its orbit.|$|E
500|$|The {{distinction}} between the two sub-groups is thought to imply that they result from two separate parent comets, which themselves were once part of a 'grandparent' comet which fragmented several orbits previously. [...] One possible candidate for the grandparent is a comet observed by Aristotle and Ephorus in 371 BC. [...] Ephorus claimed to have seen this comet break into two. However modern <b>astronomers</b> <b>are</b> skeptical of the claims of Ephorus, because they were not confirmed by other sources. Instead comets that arrived between 3rd and 5th centuries AD (comets of 214, 426 and 467) are considered as possible progenitors of the Kreutz family. The original comet must certainly have been very large indeed, perhaps as large as 100km across (for comparison, the nucleus of Comet Hale–Bopp was about 40km across).|$|E

2500|$|In {{describing}} this motion astronomers {{generally have}} shortened the term to simply [...] "precession". In describing {{the cause of}} the motion physicists have also used the term [...] "precession", which has led to some confusion between the observable phenomenon and its cause, which matters because in astronomy, some precessions are real and others are apparent.
