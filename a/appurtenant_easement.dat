50|$|An {{easement}} or {{license to}} drill for oil, gas, or minerals generally runs with the land, {{and thus is}} an <b>appurtenant</b> <b>easement.</b> However, a utility easement generally runs with {{the owner of the}} easement, rather than running with the land, and as such, is an example of an easement in gross.|$|E
50|$|A {{dominant}} estate is the parcel of real property {{that has an}} easement over another piece of property (the servient estate). The type of easement involved is almost always an <b>appurtenant</b> <b>easement.</b> Likewise, it is almost always an affirmative easement, that is, one that permits a person to do something. Estate is a common law concept.|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} {{analysis}} in the text are the issues concerned with the transmission easement and the adverse possession thereof {{on the grounds of}} the Polish law. The text features: (1) a historical outline of the solutions concerned with easements in the Polish law following 1945, (2) the institution of transmission easement introduced in 2008 and the solutions concerned with the claims for the establishment thereof at court, (3) the institution of adverse possession of transmission easement pursuant to civil law regulations, judicature and the legal doctrine. On account of the need to elaborate the wide-ranging legal issues concerned with the transmission easement in this text, the analysis embraces two research questions giving rise to the following conclusions: (1) What function is performed by the institution of transmission easement in the system of civil-law relations in the Polish law? The legislator in the articles introducing a transmission easement ossified the solutions functioning in the judicature of the Polish courts before 2008. The legal interpretation took a turn for clarification, that is for the establishment of a norm in the situation where its comprehension was dubious. It is noteworthy that in the period prior to 2008, the law provided for <b>easement</b> <b>appurtenant,</b> and on account of the usual course of judicial decisions also for <b>easement</b> <b>appurtenant</b> with the content corresponding to transmission easement. In 2008 these two “legal existences” were supplemented with a transmission easement, which nevertheless failed to resolve all the legal problems; nay, this gave rise to even more problems, e. g. the one of non-establishment of interpolar norms which would address the issues arising in connection with the use of various easement institutions in legal transactions. While amending the civil law, the legislator aimed to bring order to legal transactions by streamlining the unregulated actual state of easement in relation to transmission infrastructure, but also in relation to the situations where an easement was yet to be established and a facility yet to be constructed. Thus, such action is intended to regulate the disorderly legislation in force as well as to safeguard investment processes. This is of particular significance, for example, for energy companies which are burdened with statutory public-law obligations as regards securing energy supplies and providing for the development of energy infrastructure. Hence, the de facto introduced civil-law solutions indirectly served to realise the principles of the doctrine of easement in the public interest. (2) What legal problems in the civil-law relations does the application of the institution of transmission easement by adverse possession entail? On account of the functioning of various institutions of easement, that is (1) an <b>easement</b> <b>appurtenant,</b> (2) an <b>easement</b> <b>appurtenant</b> with the content corresponding to a transmission easement, and as of 2008 (3) a transmission easement, a problem arose as to which of the given easements companies exercised in particular periods, all the more so because before 1989 the State Treasury owned them and many of the transmission facilities were put in place by virtue of administrative decisions. The commonly held belief is that in the period of “society-oriented economy” as well as up to 2008 infrastructure companies could exercise an <b>easement</b> <b>appurtenant</b> which corresponded to the content of a transmission easement. Therefore, in such a case the running of the prescriptive period should allow for the general rules laid down for an <b>easement</b> <b>appurtenant.</b> Apart from the problem of the relation of a capacity to exercise a right to property and the free development of civil-law relations before 1989, the recognition of the running of prescriptive periods – given the functioning of the three various easements as legal institutions – became a significant legal problem. By way of illustration, the recognition – against the period of exercising transmission easement – of the period required for the acquisition thereof by adverse possession, whereby before 3 August 2008 the real estate featured the legal state corresponding to the content of this right, is debatable. One cannot recognise that within that period a transmission easement was exercised, because such a right was not in existence as yet. Therefore, the institution that might be employed is the running of the period as regards the adverse possession in relation to an <b>easement</b> <b>appurtenant</b> with the content of a transmission easement. Still, the problem remains as to whether the period of the exercise of the <b>easement</b> <b>appurtenant</b> with the content corresponding to a transmission easement can be recognised against the period of possession required for the adverse possession of a transmission easement pursuant to the regulations introduced in 2008. One might incline to the position whereby in such a case it would be right to fully recognise – against the period of exercising a transmission easement – the period of exercising an <b>easement</b> <b>appurtenant</b> corresponding thereto in respect of its content. That being so, the adverse possession of a transmission easement might ensue in such a situation on 3 August 2008 at the earliest, that is the moment the regulations governing this right come into effect. Conversely, if the prescriptive period expires before that date, the entrepreneur would acquire an <b>easement</b> <b>appurtenant</b> with the content corresponding to the transmission easement. Such an interpretation is aligned with the purpose intended by the legislator, which is to bring order to the actual state of the broadest scope with the aid of a new legal instrument. The text, while analysing the issue of a transmission easement and an adverse possession thereof as a institution of the civil law, presents only some selected problems. Hence, the analysis does not include, for example, the issues concerned with claims for remuneration (for usufruct without contractual basis or usufruct fees), or claims for compensation (redress or amends). Furthermore, the text does not conduct a more profound analysis of the relation between the provisions regulating public-law relations (e. g. acts of law introducing the institution of dispossession) and the provisions regulating civil-law relations (the easements in question). The object of {{analysis in the}} text are the issues concerned with the transmission easement and the adverse possession thereof {{on the grounds of the}} Polish civil law. The main sections of this thesis address the following issues; (1) a historical outline of the solutions concerned with easements in the Polish law following 1945, (2) the institution of transmission easement introduced in 2008 and the solutions concerned with the claims for the establishment thereof at court, (3) the institution of adverse possession of transmission easement pursuant to civil law regulations, judicature and the legal doctrine. With a view to elaborating the research issues, the thesis addresses the following research questions: (1) What function is performed by the institution of transmission easement in the system of civil-law relations in the Polish law?, (2) What legal problems in the civil-law relations does the application of the institution of transmission easement by adverse possession entail...|$|R
50|$|An earlier {{church was}} built on a hill in the hundred Haldherred {{probably}} in the 12th century, and is known from the 13th century as Essenbæk (Eskingbec) - a name which perhaps refers to the present Volkmølle Creek (Volkmølle Bæk). The first particle esking supposedly means an inhabitant of Assentoft, but the creek seems later to have been named after a fulling mill (valkemølle), which in time, however, was used as gristmill.The church was first built in Romanesque style as a nave and probably a chancel - internally consisting of granite boulders built around raw fieldstone, and externally of granite ashlars. On {{the northern and southern}} side of the church were a simple rectangular entrance, and the ceiling of the church was flat and plastery. Later the chancel was torn down, after which the eastern end of the nave, demarcated by an ogival chancel arch, was used as such, and the northern entrance was walled up. Probably also later a small round arched window was established on the northern side, and a steeple resting on five pillars built into the nave and with pyramid roof of lead was added above the southwestern corner of the church. A church porch at the southern entrance and a groin vault seem added in the 15th century. Then the church was internally 31¾ alen (19.93 meters) long og 12¼ alen (7.69 meters) wide. The church stood in the northwestern corner of a ca. 65 meters long og 65 meters wide churchyard fenced in by a 1.5 meter high boulder dike, southwesterly in which was a driving gate and a walking gate in a whitewashed portal in late Medieval style of large medieval brick. Already September 4, 1424 the church was called Old Essenbæk (Gamel Essenbæk; Gammel Essenbæk), and was then owned by Essenbæk Abbey, which together with its estate was confiscated by the king in 1540. When the abbey was later torn down, its bell was taken to the church.Christen Skel Jørgensen bought September 7, 1678 ”the church’s share of the tithe of the mentioned parishes, the <b>appurtenant</b> <b>easement</b> over the parsonages and the smallholdings of the parish clerks and all of the churches’ adjoining land estate and other <b>appurtenant</b> <b>easement</b> and the right of presentation” (Kirkens Andel af Tienden af de nævnte Sogne, Herligheden over Præstegaardene og Degnebolene og alt Kirkernes tilliggende Jordegods og anden Herlighed samt Kaldsretten) including e.g. Essenbæk Parish. With this so-called right of patronage he was in reality the owner of the church, though with the responsibility for its condition.|$|E
50|$|Brachtenbach, {{while sitting}} as a Washington State Supreme Court Justice, wrote the opinion for Brown v. Voss, 105 Wash.2d 366, 715 P.2d 514 (1986). The issue in Voss was: {{to what extent}} can the owner of a private road {{easement}} traverse the servient estate to not only reach the dominant estate, but a parcel (subsequently acquired by the dominant estate owner) adjacent to the dominant estate when such usage does not increase the burden on the servient estate? While Brachtenbach stated the general rule that an <b>easement</b> <b>appurtenant</b> to one parcel of land may not be extended by the owner of the dominant estate to an additional non-dominant parcel owned by the owner of the dominant estate regardless of whether the additional parcel is adjacent to the dominant estate, and further declared that if an <b>easement</b> <b>appurtenant</b> serves a particular parcel of land, any extension of the easement is a misuse of the easement—Brachtenbach still ultimately allowed the owner of the dominant estate to continue using the easement to access the additional, non-dominant estate because a grant of injunctive relief would be inappropriate in light of the circumstances. In short, Brachtenbach essentially found in favor of the Plaintiff by not granting the defendant injunctive relief (i.e. preventing the owner of the dominant estate to continue to use the easement to access the adjacent non-dominant estate) although the plaintiff unlawfully extended the easement. Brachtenbach rationalized that a grant of injunctive relief under the circumstances would be inappropriate and against the principles of equity because (while no additional harm to the servient estate resulted from the extension of the easement) if injunctive relief was in fact given to the defendant, it would only serve to harm the plaintiff while not providing any benefit or protection to the defendant.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} an {{interest}} 2 ̆ 2 running 2 ̆ 2 with particular realty is employed in connection with assignments of easements and profits to develop rules which are reasonably clear and free from dispute in most situations. The burden, on the servient land passes with such land to all takers thereof. In theory {{this end of the}} easement or profit runs with the servient tenement itself, rather than merely with an estate therein, and hence is binding upon even adverse possessors of the freehold. The benefit of an <b>easement</b> <b>appurtenant</b> to some dominant tenement passes freely therewith even without separate mention. The benefit of a profit appurtenant passes in similar fashion. The only limitation is that the servient land must not be 2 ̆ 2 surcharged, 2 ̆ 2 or unduly burdened, by certain transfers as described below. s The benefit of a profit in gross is freely assignable from one person to another, subject only to the rule that where assigned to more than one the new takers must 2 ̆ 2 work together with one stock 2 ̆ 2 that is, in common as one person. But when we come to easements in gross, a serious difference of opinion exists on the question {{whether or not they are}} transferable. A large portion of this essay will be devoted to a consideration of this particular problem...|$|R
40|$|In {{the case}} of Lever v. Grant, 1 the supreme court passed {{incidentally}} upon {{the effect of a}} tax deed on an <b>easement</b> <b>appurtenant</b> to the estate on which the delinquent taxes had been levied. From the facts in that case it appears that in 1884 the owner of a parcel of land in the city of Detroit, bounded on the west by Woodward avenue, platted the same. The plat shows a street on the north side extending from Woodward avenue east thirty feet wide, one-half the width of an ordinary street. This street was named Custer Avenue. The next year, 1885, other owners platted a parcel of land adjoining Custer avenue on the north. Upon this plat appears a strip of land the same width as Custer avenue and bordering it on the north marked 2 ̆ 2 Private way. 2 ̆ 2 In the dedication of this plat, the owners, after dedicating to the public the streets and alleys appearing thereon, add: 2 ̆ 2 excepting the north 30 feet of Custer avenue, which we reserve as a private right of way. 2 ̆ 2 North of Custer avenue and parallel therewith is Bethune avenue. The land between the 2 ̆ 2 private way 2 ̆ 2 and Bethune avenue was divided into lots, three of which front Woodward avenue and extend east and west and the others extend north and south from the 2 ̆ 2 private way 2 ̆ 2 to Bethune avenue. Grant, the defendant, purchased the lot fronting Woodward avenue and adjoining the 2 ̆ 2 private way. 2 ̆ 2 In 1890, this private way was assessed for city taxes, and Grant upon the sale therefor, obtained a lease from the city of Detroit for 99 years. In 1894 the defendant obtained from the owners, the proprietors of the plat, the fee of so much of the private way as extended along the side of his lot, and he enclosed the same...|$|R
