40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the source of}} this overestimation bias. It is shown that this bias does not arise due to sentence-bound syntactic constraints, but that it is a direct consequence of topic cohesion in discourse. The nonrandom, clustered appearance of lexically specialized words, often the key words of the text, explains the main trends in the overestimation bias both quantitatively and qualitatively. The effects of nonrandomness are so strong that they introduce an overestimation bias in distributions of units derived from words, such as syllables and digrams. Nonrandom word usage also affects the accuracy of the Good-Turingfrequency estimates which,for the lowest frequencies, reveal a strong underestimation bias. A heuristic <b>adjusted</b> <b>frequency</b> estimate is proposed that, at least for novel-sized texts, is considerably more accurat...|$|E

However, as has been pointed out correctly and repeatedly, frequencies of (co-) occurrence in isolation may sometimes be severely misleading given that they alone to not take into consideration the degree of dispersion of the relevant linguistic variable in question. In order to handle such problems, several scholars suggested a variety of dispersion measures and <b>adjusted</b> <b>frequency</b> measures. Unfortunately, however, few scholars appear to be aware of this issue and measures of dispersion are apparently not widely know and even less widely used. Another unfortunate aspect of such measures is that many of them also come with a variety of problems. I pursue three objectives with this article. First, in order to raise awareness of this thematic complex and make the available measures more widely known, I present an overview {{of a large number of}} dispersion measures and <b>adjusted</b> <b>frequency</b> measures – including some more recent measures that have not found their way into research articles and textbooks yet – and summarily discuss some of their advantages and disadvantages. Second, I propose for discussion a conceptually very simple alternative measure, DP, explain and exemplify its properties, and compare it to the more or less established measures on the basis of fictitious distributions from the literature, word frequencies from the BNC Sampler, and co-occurrence data from the ICE-GB. I will conclude that DP is at least as discriminatory as most if not all other existing measures but conceptually simpler and even better in some respects.

I then exemplified this measure on the basis of word frequency data on co-occurrence data of words and construction/patterns. However, in spite of the advantages of DP and in spite of its relevance for virtually all corpus-linguistic work, dispersion is still a very much under-researched topic: to the best of my knowledge, there is not a single study investigating how different measures compare to each other when applied to large datasets. The present article therefore is largely programmatic and exploratory: it sketches out a research program for the investigation of measures of dispersion and <b>adjusted</b> <b>frequencies</b> and takes some initial steps itself. More specifically, this paper addresses the issues of the integration of frequencies and dispersion measures and the quantitative comparison of dispersion measures and <b>adjusted</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Finally, the paper makes available a few online resources that will hopefully stimulate more research in this central area of corpus-linguistic methodology and help other researchers go beyond the first programmatic steps taken here.

40|$|International audienceThe {{issue of}} {{adjusting}} vibro-acoustical computational cost {{is especially important}} when enhancing the sound quality of a mechanical structure using simulation. Simulation parameters must be specified so as to: i) reduce computational cost, and ii) satisfy perceptual constraints. For a simple plate-cavity system, the adjustment of computational cost is investigated {{in the framework of}} evaluating the influence of variable structural parameters (cavity absorption, thickness and tightening conditions of the plate) on the auditory perception of sounds radiated inside the cavity. By concentrating on such a simple system, we eventually aim at achieving some recommendations adaptable to different vibrating structures of our environment - in the areas of transport and building made up of plane elements coupled with enclosures. Considering stationary sounds, this study deals with the adjustment of a major frequency computation parameter, i. e. frequency resolution. The specification of the frequency resolution for vibro-acoustical simulations has a great influence on the spectral envelope of the sounds synthesized afterwards. Here, we modify the spectral envelope of real sounds in order to reproduce the envelope of spectra of synthesized sounds that would be computed in a simulation using a given frequency resolution. The adjustment process pursues the following objective: determining a frequency resolution for which certain perceptual outcomes relative to modified real sounds remain similar to those concerning the original real sounds. These perceptual constraints are pertinent regarding the issue of adjusting vibro-acoustical computational cost. These constraints notably concern the merits of the stimuli and are translated into two adjustment criteria. The results of a first experiment, an auditory evaluation of partial corpora of modified stimuli, highlight that, for the plate-cavity system under consideration, 4 Hz may be an <b>adjusted</b> <b>frequency</b> resolution. The consequences of using this frequency resolution are then further assessed through a second experiment, an auditory evaluation of the complete corpus of modified stimuli. A wider range of perceptual results (perceptual spaces, preference spaces and merits) obtained for the modified sounds and the original sounds are compared. It is shown that both adjustment criteria are fulfilled for the <b>adjusted</b> <b>frequency</b> resolution equal to 4 Hz...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper makes {{preliminary}} {{steps at}} exploring a novel application of cognitive radios (CRs) for reliable satellite communications. We propose {{the use of}} dynamically <b>adjusted</b> <b>frequency</b> hopping (FH) sequences for satellite transmissions. Such sequences are more robust against smart eavesdropping and targeted interference than fixed FH sequences. In our approach, FH sequence is adjusted according to the outcome of out-of-band sensing, carried out by a CR module that resides in the satellite itself or at the receiving ground station. Our protocol, called OSDFH, relies on exploiting the spectrum sensing capabilities of CRs for proactive detection of channel quality. We analyze {{the characteristics of the}} proposed OSDFH using a finite state Markov chain (FSMC) framework. Level crossing rate (LCR) analysis is used to determine the transition probabilities of the Markov chain. These probabilities are then used to measure the “channel stability, ” a metric that reflects the freshness of sensed channel interference. We use simulations to study the effects of different system parameters on the performance of our proposed protocol.

A generalpurpose, reusable base vocabulary should therefore be based on a corpus with multiple genres and domains, such as a balanced corpus. To make the base vocabulary reusable for several applications, we propose a base vocabulary pool, i. e. a ranked and annotated base vocabulary where the ranking is stable across genres and domains, and from which various subsets could be extracted for various application needs. In the paper, we describe the derivation of a Swedish base lemma vocabulary pool from the 1 -million word balanced corpora Stockholm-Umeå Corpus (SUC).

Using an array-based detection method, we determined the cross-sectional frequency of human herpesviruses in semen from 198 Danish sperm donors. Fifty-five of the donors {{had at least}} one ejaculate that was positive for one or more human herpesvirus. Of these 27. 3 % (n = 15) had a double herpesvirus infection. If corrected for the presence of multiple ejaculates from some donors, the <b>adjusted</b> <b>frequency</b> of herpesviruses in semen was 27. 2 % with HSV- 1 in 0. 4 %; HSV- 2 in 0. 1 %; EBV in 6. 3 %; HCMV in 2. 7 %; HHV- 6 A/B in 13. 5 %; HHV- 7 in 4. 2 %, whereas none of the samples had detectable VZV or HHV- 8. Subsequently, we examined longitudinally data on ejaculates from 11 herpesvirus-positive donors. Serial analyses revealed that a donor who tested positive for herpesvirus at one time point did not necessarily remain positive over time. For the most frequently found herpesvirus, HHV- 6 A/B, we examined its association with sperm. For HHV- 6 A/B PCR-positive semen samples, HHV- 6 A/B could be detected on the sperm by flow cytometry. Conversely, PCR-negative semen samples were negative by flow cytometry. HHV- 6 B was shown to associate with sperm within minutes in a concentration dependent manner. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that HHV- 6 B associated with the sperm head, but only to sperm with an intact acrosome.

40|$|Abstract Background With {{the advance}} of {{large-scale}} omics technologies, it is now feasible to reversely engineer the underlying genetic networks that describe the complex interplays of molecular elements that lead to complex diseases. Current networking approaches are mainly focusing on building genetic networks at large without probing the interaction mechanisms specific to a physiological or disease condition. The {{aim of this study}} was thus to develop such a novel networking approach based on the relevance concept, which is ideal to reveal integrative effects of multiple genes in the underlying genetic circuit for complex diseases. Results The approach started with identification of multiple disease pathways, called a gene forest, in which the genes extracted from the decision forest constructed by supervised learning of the genome-wide transcriptional profiles for patients and normal samples. Based on the newly identified disease mechanisms, a novel pair-wise relevance metric, <b>adjusted</b> <b>frequency</b> value, was used to define the degree of genetic relationship between two molecular determinants. We applied the proposed method to analyze a publicly available microarray dataset for colon cancer. The results demonstrated that the colon cancer-specific gene network captured the most important genetic interactions in several cellular processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, mitogenesis and immunity, which are known to be pivotal for tumourigenesis. Further analysis of the topological architecture of the network identified three known hub cancer genes [interleukin 8 (IL 8) (p ≈ 0), desmin (DES) (p = 2. 71 × 10 - 6) and enolase 1 (ENO 1) (p = 4. 19 × 10 - 5) ], while two novel hub genes [RNA binding motif protein 9 (RBM 9) (p = 1. 50 × 10 - 4) and ribosomal protein L 30 (RPL 30) (p = 1. 50 × 10 - 4) ] may define new central elements in the gene network specific to colon cancer. Gene Ontology (GO) based analysis of the colon cancer-specific gene network and the sub-network that consisted of three-way gene interactions suggested that tumourigenesis in colon cancer resulted from dysfunction in protein biosynthesis and categories associated with ribonucleoprotein complex which are well supported by multiple lines of experimental evidence. Conclusion This study demonstrated that IL 8, DES and ENO 1 act as the central elements in colon cancer susceptibility, and protein biosynthesis and the ribosome-associated function categories largely account for the colon cancer tumuorigenesis. Thus, the newly developed relevancy-based networking approach offers a powerful means to reverse-engineer the disease-specific network, a promising tool for systematic dissection of complex diseases. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to answer the}} following two main research questions: 1) In what order should learners of Japanese as a second language learn words and characters {{in order to be able}} to read Japanese? 2) How will the order vary according to the purpose of learning? To answer these questions, a Vocabulary Database for Reading Japanese (VDRJ) and a Character Database of Japanese (CDJ) were first developed from the Balanced Contemporary Corpus of Written Japanese (BCCWJ) 2009 monitor version (NINJAL, 2009) which contains book texts and internet-forum site texts with 33 million running words in total. Word and character rankings for international students, non-academic learners and general written Japanese were included in these databases. These rankings were proven to be valid for their respective purposes as they provided higher text coverage for the target texts than other texts. After analysing the use of vocabulary and characters in Japanese, three groups of domain-specific words, namely common academic words, limited-academic-domain words and literary words were extracted. In order to test the expected efficiency for learning these groups of words, an index entitled Text Covering Efficiency (TCE) in different types of texts was proposed. The TCE represents the expected return per unit of text length from learning a group of words. As such, the TCE score in the target text domain should determine the order in which words in this domain are most efficiently learned. Indeed, the extracted common academic words and limited-academic-domain words showed significantly higher text coverage and TCE scores in academic texts than in other texts. Literary words also provided high text coverage and high TCE scores in literary texts, despite a lower efficiency level than that of academic vocabulary in academic texts. Learning domain-specific words is expected to be much more efficient than learning other words at the intermediate level. At the advanced level or above, learning domain-specific words will be further more efficient in some domains such as the natural sciences. In sum, the TCE has been shown to provide useful information for deciding on the learning order of various groups of words. Other findings based on the analyses using the databases and word lists include the features of some indices for dispersion and <b>adjusted</b> <b>frequency,</b> lexical features of different media and genres, indexicality of the distributions of word origins and parts of speech, and the discrepancy between learning orders of words and Kanji. A Lexical Learning Possibility Index for a Reading Text (LEPIX) was also proposed for the simplification of a text as a vocabulary learning resource...|$|E
