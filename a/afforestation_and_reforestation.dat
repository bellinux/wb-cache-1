40|$|The {{relationship}} between the natural and anthropic components of territorial systems or complexes of coupled socio-economic and natural systems is changing in time under the effect of socio- economic and political drivers. One {{way of looking at}} it is through the changes of land cover and use, which are connected also to the dynamics of the eco-energies during the anthropization process. The aim of this paper is to perform an analysis of long-term land cover and use changes of the Romanian territory, hypothesizing that the transition period, with its more or less benefic economic periods, was characterized by an uncontrolled development resulting in important environmental impacts. The results confirm the hypothesisand underline several phenomena; some of them are antagonistic (decline and development of agriculture, deforestation <b>and</b> <b>afforestation</b> or <b>reforestation),</b> <b>and</b> others, such as urbanization, seem to occur mainly in one direction. The most affected areas are the limit of North-East and Center regions (due to deforestations) and the area around Bucharest and the shoreline (due to urbanization) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} change of forestland in the Central Russian Upland within the {{deciduous}} forest, forest-steppe, and steppe zones using old maps (XVIII-XX cc.) and current satellite images. The forest distribution within the Central Russian Upland has been relatively stable during the last 220 years. On average, the decrease in the forested area was small. However, we identified significant changes in certain regions. In {{the southern part of}} CRU, the significant increase of the forested land is caused by the forest protection of abatis woodland <b>and</b> <b>afforestation.</b> During the last 100 years, reforestation took place mainly in the Oka basin due to both <b>afforestation</b> <b>and</b> natural <b>reforestation.</b> New forests appeared generally in ravines within all zones.

50|$|The Forestry Commission was {{established}} {{as part of}} the Forestry Act 1919.

During the Great Depression the Forestry Commission's estate continued to grow so that it was just over 360,000 hectares of land by 1934.
