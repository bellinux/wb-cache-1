5|$|After {{defeat in}} World War I, Germany was plunged into bankruptcy, social injustice, poverty, crime and mass unemployment. During these {{depressing}} years, Germany saw {{the creation of}} a number of extremist political and paramilitary associations, representing both the far-left and the far-right. Amidst this crisis, Schaub decided to join the National Socialist German Workers Party, later commonly known as the Nazi Party; he became member #81. The political program of the party was essentially <b>a</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terms of the Treaty of Versailles, antisemitism, and anti-Bolshevism, driven by Adolf Hitler and his world view.|$|E
5|$|Although not an isolationist, Coolidge was {{reluctant}} to enter into foreign alliances. He considered the 1920 Republican victory as <b>a</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wilsonian position that the United States should join the League of Nations. While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, {{and he did not}} advocate membership. He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions. In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own. The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.|$|E

5|$|At a Missouri state {{constitutional}} convention in 1875, delegates {{from the region}} agreed on a separation plan. A Board of Freeholders from St. Louis county and city reorganized boundaries and proposed a final plan of separation in mid-1876. The new city charter also tripled {{the size of the}} city to include the new rural parks (such as Forest Park) and the useful riverfront from the MissouriMississippi confluence to the mouth of the River Des Peres. After a fraudulent election initially showed <b>a</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plan, a recount in December 1876 showed voters had approved the separation.|$|E
5|$|Not every {{question}} or every criminal case was {{eligible for a}} certificate of division. In United States v. Daniel (1821), the Court held that a motion for a new trialas authorized by the § 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789could not {{be the subject of}} a certificate of division; rather, the division would operate <b>a</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motion. Similarly, in United States v. Bailey (1835), the Court held that {{the question of whether the}} evidence was legally sufficient to support the offense charged could not be certified. In United States v. Briggs (Briggs I) (1847), the Court further limited its jurisdiction to hear criminal certificates of division by holding that the question of whether a demurrer to an indictment should be sustained was to general to be certified.|$|E
5|$|Vietnamese and French {{historians have}} {{fiercely}} debated Định's choice {{to disregard the}} treaty. The effectiveness of Định's insurgency led French officials to claim that Tự Đức was secretly assisting him, thereby violating the treaty, a pretext the French used to seize three more provinces in 1867. Vietnamese records dispute this, contending that Tự Đức attempted to ensure Định's compliance with the treaty. Định's defiance of the emperor has led historians to debate whether his actions were motivated by <b>a</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monarch's authority or whether he disobeyed {{in an attempt to}} help Tự Đức. Định remains widely respected among Vietnamese of all political persuasions. During the Vietnam War, communist historians sought to portray the Việt Cộng as Định's modern successor.|$|E

5|$|From the mid-sixteenth {{century the}} Reformation revolutionised church {{architecture}} in Scotland. It resulted in <b>a</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elaborate ornamentation of existing churches. New churches were produced {{in a plain}} style, often with a T-plan that emphasised the pulpit and preaching. This style was adopted by both Presbyterian and Episcopalian wings of the Scottish Kirk, {{but there were some}} attempts to introduce Baroque elements into church building after the Restoration. In the eighteenth century the influence of James Gibbs led to churches that employed classical elements, with a pedimented rectangular plan and often with a steeple. This classicism continued into the early nineteenth century, but became increasingly controversial and began to be rejected for a version of the Gothic revival, which flourished into the early twentieth century. Between the world wars, a form of neo-Romanesque became the norm for new churches. In {{the second half of the}} twentieth century new churches were highly influenced by modernism, resulting in rectangular and irregularly shaped buildings, built in new materials, although many of these were later demolished. As the level of new building reduced from the 1970s there was a move to functional and unambitious new churches, but in the 1980s there was a move back to more striking and original designs.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than <b>a</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theoretical system.|$|E
5|$|On 27 June, Maisky {{agreed to}} the sending of two {{commissions}} to Spain, to enumerate foreign volunteer forces, and to bring about their withdraw. It was estimated to cost £1,750,000 to £2,250,000, borne by member countries of the Committee. The Nationalists wished to prevent {{the fall of the}} favourable Chamberlain government in the United Kingdom, and so were seen to accept the plan. With much bemoaning, the Republicans also accepted the plan. The Nationalists demanded belligerent rights first, then withdrawals of 10,000 from each side after, which amounted to <b>a</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plan. Following the Munich Agreement – judged by Chamberlain to have been a success – Britain would host similar mediation in Spain. Negrín would propose the removal of the International Brigades, a majority of whom were now Spaniards, at the last meeting of the League of Nations, thereby showing his contempt for the Non-Intervention Committee. Similarly, Italians would leave Spain under the Anglo-Italian agreement, not through the Committee.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Appeal {{also held}} that legal {{precedents}} from other Commonwealth jurisdictions supported <b>a</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subjective test {{in favour of}} the objective test. The subjective test was applied in Liversidge v. Anderson (1941) and subsequently affirmed in Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1941). However, these decisions had been departed from in subsequent decisions by the Privy Council and House of Lords. These courts had rejected the subjective test applied by the majority in Liversidge, preferring the objective test applied by Lord Atkin in his dissenting judgment. In the light of these developments, the Malaysian case of Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister for Home Affairs), Malaysia (1969), which had applied the test in Liversidge and which the respondents' counsel had relied on {{in support of the}} subjective test, could no longer be considered good law. Additionally, Teh Cheng Poh v. Public Prosecutor (1978) decided by the Privy Council on appeal from Malaysia, was referred to by the Court in support of the objective test. The case concerned the exercise of discretionary power under the Malaysian Internal Security Act, which the ISA of Singapore is derived from.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{played a}} role in the {{evacuation}} of federal troops from Texas at the onset of the American Civil War. As Texas considered whether to secede from the United States, General David E. Twiggs, commander of federal troops in Texas negotiated with state leaders concerning the transfer of federal property. After learning of such negotiations, the United States military moved to decommission Twiggs, and replace him with Colonel Carlos Waite. Texas viewed this move as <b>a</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negotiations and proceeded to forcefully claim the federal property. Twiggs, while awaiting relief from Waite, surrendered the property on the condition that federal troops could peacefully evacuate. They were allowed to depart, but only from the Texas coast. Waite arrived and relocated troops near Green Lake, where they could await coastal departure near an adequate source of freshwater. During the stay, Fort Sumter fell under siege, and Texas grew concerned about the concentration of armed federal troops in the area. With their respective nations now at war, Texas considered the deal with Twiggs void, and began to capture federal troops to force them to either join the Confederacy or be Prisoners of War. Some of the remaining uncaptured companies elsewhere in the state attempted to flee to Green Lake. Several regiments camped by the lake later in the war, and complained about mosquitos.|$|E
5|$|The {{themes of}} Reflections {{are similar to}} those of The Eolian Harp. They are set in the same location, and both {{describe}} Coleridge's relationship with his wife and sexual desire. The reflection on his life within the poem represent an unwillingness to accept his current idyllic life and <b>a</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conclusion drawn in The Eolian Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God in Coleridge's view, he reflects on how one cannot simply exist in such an area but must actively seek out truth in order to fulfill God's will. The poem details how men feel a need to seek truth like a philosopher while also desiring to simply live in an idyllic natural state. The poem reconciles these desires by claiming that the pursuer of truth can still reflect back on his time when he was simply enjoying nature and God's presence.|$|E
