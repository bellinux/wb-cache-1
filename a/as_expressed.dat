5|$|A {{revival of}} {{interest}} in Hazlitt, as a thinker, began in the mid-20th century.

5|$|Eliminativism about a {{class of}} {{entities}} is the view that that class of entities does not exist. For example, materialism tends to be eliminativist about the soul; modern chemists are eliminativist about phlogiston; and modern physicists are eliminativist {{about the existence of}} luminiferous aether. Eliminative materialism is the relatively new (1960s–1970s) idea that certain classes of mental entities that common sense takes for granted, such as beliefs, desires, and the subjective sensation of pain, do not exist. The most common versions are eliminativism about propositional attitudes, <b>as</b> <b>expressed</b> by Paul and Patricia Churchland,and eliminativism about qualia (subjective interpretations about particular instances of subjective experience), <b>as</b> <b>expressed</b> by Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey. These philosophers often appeal to an introspection illusion.|$|E
5|$|Germany is a federal, parliamentary, {{representative}} democratic republic.

5|$|The Assemblies of God holds to a conservative, evangelical and Arminian {{theology}} <b>as</b> <b>expressed</b> in the Statement of Fundamental Truths {{and position}} papers, which emphasize such core Pentecostal doctrines as the baptism in the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongues, divine healing and the Second Coming of Christ.

Divisions between traditionalist and pro-European factions at the queen's court created opportunities that European intermediaries exploited {{in an attempt}} to hasten the succession of Ranavalona's son, Radama II. The young prince disagreed with many of his mother's policies and was amenable to French proposals for the exploitation of the island's resources, <b>as</b> <b>expressed</b> in the Lambert Charter he concluded with a French representative in 1855. These plans were never successful, however, and Radama II was not to take the throne until 1861, when Ranavalona died aged 83.|$|E
5|$|An {{in-house}} {{waste water}} treatment and reuse facility, organic waste treatment facilities, and solar powered energy were among the environmentally friendly practices adopted by the Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games Organising Committee Headquarters (OC CWG Delhi 2010). At the same time, most of the transport fleet provided for the Games ran on green fuels such as battery electric vehicles and compressed natural gas. Residents and guests could also offset travel-accumulated carbon emissions by computing their footprint and then procuring carbon credits at the specifically created Green Games Carbon Neutrality Kiosk. The World Anti-Doping Agency set up an anti-doping education hub {{in collaboration with the}} organisers. Construction of the Games Village as a whole however was marred by delays and organisational inefficiencies, leading to concerns <b>as</b> <b>expressed</b> by athletes and the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) (see below).|$|E
5|$|As it is {{constructed}} using tensors, general relativity exhibits general covariance: its laws—and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework—take {{on the same}} form in all coordinate systems. Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e. it is background independent. It thus satisfies a more stringent general principle of relativity, namely that {{the laws of physics}} are the same for all observers. Locally, <b>as</b> <b>expressed</b> in the equivalence principle, spacetime is Minkowskian, and the laws of physics exhibit local Lorentz invariance.|$|E

5|$|During that period, the Batavia Society of Arts and Sciences, {{whose main}} {{interests}} were in archaeological research and conservation, {{became interested in}} the newly invented albumen print medium. The society felt that the world should know more about Javanese culture <b>as</b> <b>expressed</b> in the old inscriptions, statues, customs and temples. The Society arranged an archaeological tour around Java, headed by J.F.G. Brumund, a priest of the Batavian Evangelic Community and a specialist in Javanese. The Society also commissioned van Kinsbergen to accompany Brumund during his tour in order to illustrate Brumund's publication of Javanese culture and antiquities. The government granted permission for this tour, with the restriction that all wet-prints (cliches) would be government property and that extra printing would only be allowed with permission from the government.|$|E
5|$|Eric Foner (2010) {{contrasts}} the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, {{with the}} conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government <b>as</b> <b>expressed</b> in the Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, George Strait, and Willie Nelson are Black's biggest musical influences. His {{style is}} {{traditional}} country. His voice {{is described as}} a smooth baritone and was initially compared to Merle Haggard. Black was self-taught on harmonica, guitar and bass at an early age. On his studio albums he plays acoustic and electric guitars as well as harmonica. In concert he plays primarily guitar, but does play drums and harmonica. Today, Clint Black is still an inspiration to new, up and coming country artists, <b>as</b> <b>expressed</b> by performers such as Jon Pardi and Aaron Watson.|$|E

Eccles, Masao Ito, and János Szentágothai. Although a full understanding of cerebellar function has remained elusive, at least four principles have been identified as important: (1) feedforward processing, (2) divergence and convergence, (3) modularity, and (4) plasticity.|$|E
5|$|The {{equivalence}} between {{mass and}} energy, <b>as</b> <b>expressed</b> by the formula E=mc, {{is the most}} famous consequence of special relativity. In relativity, mass and energy are two different ways of describing one physical quantity. If a physical system has energy, {{it also has the}} corresponding mass, and vice versa. In particular, all properties of a body that are associated with energy, such as its temperature or the binding energy of systems such as nuclei or molecules, contribute to that body's mass, and hence act as sources of gravity.|$|E

The only western province where the Justinianic code was introduced was Italy (after the conquest by the so-called Pragmatic Sanction of 554), from where it was to pass to Western Europe in the 12th century and become the basis of much European law code. It eventually passed to Eastern Europe where it appeared in Slavic editions, and it also passed on to Russia. It remains influential to this day.|$|E
