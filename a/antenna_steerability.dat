30|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{orthogonal}} {{condition of the}} Bragg condition, {{it is important to}} investigate the propagation characteristics of the sound waves. Then, the antenna beam of WPR should be steered into the appropriate directions that intersect the sound wavefront perpendicularly. The MU radar and EAR have an advantage in the capability to point the antenna beam into any direction by employing the active phased array. Masuda (1988) developed a two-dimensional ray-tracing algorithm for RASS experiments with the MU radar, leading to the expansion of the RASS height coverage. The method was improved to treat a three-dimensional (3 -D) case for RASS with Gadanki MST radar (Sarma et al. 2008). However, for the Gadanki MST radar, the antenna beam was steered into only two orthogonal azimuth directions, aligned in the north–south and east–west directions. In this study, we developed a 3 -D ray-tracing method, aiming its application of RASS to EAR, having full <b>antenna</b> <b>steerability.</b>|$|E

Mechanical 144 GHz beam steering with all-metallic epsilon-near-zero lens antenna. Applied Physics Letters, 105 (24), doi: 10. 1063 / 1. 4903865, {{and may be}} found at [URL] all-metallic steerable beam antenna composed of an ε-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterial lens is experimentally demonstrated at 144 GHz (λ 0 = 2. 083 mm). The ENZ lens is realized by an array of narrow hollow rectangular waveguides working just near and above the cut-off of the TE 10 mode. The lens focal arc on the xz-plane is initially estimated analytically as well as numerically and compared with experimental results demonstrating good agreement. Next, an open-ended waveguide is placed along the lens focal arc to evaluate the ENZ-lens <b>antenna</b> <b>steerability.</b> A gain scan loss below 3 dB is achieved for angles up to plus/minus 15 º.
