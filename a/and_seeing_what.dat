In an interview promoting the service, Reznor mentioned he has started [...] "messing around with some things" [...] {{in regards to}} a new Nine Inch Nails album, stating [...] "It's not a record I'm trying to finish in a month.

Mike Schiller, writing for webzine PopMatters, was positive in his review but stated that the mix sounded like [...] "an artist throwing ideas at a wall <b>and</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>what</b> sticks". In consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave Vicki Leekx a B+ rating, indicating [...] "remarkable one way or another, yet also flirts with the humdrum or the half-assed".|$|E

It seems Archbishop Lefebvre did not see things in quite the same way even if he did respond to Padre Pio with: [...] "I will remember that, Father."

500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{announced}} by Fox in July 2013 to premiere {{in the fall}} of 2014. In May 2014, the network presented two clips from the episode at their annual upfront presentation. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly about the episode, MacFarlane stated that the key to a good crossover episode is [...] "really about the character interaction. People want to see Peter interact with Homer. They want to see Bart interact with Stewie. In a way, the story in a crossover episode, while it has to be there, is never quite as important as how the characters interact with each other." [...] The Simpsons creator Groening added, [...] "In this case, it's two really vivid shows <b>and</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>what</b> they can do together. You want to see them having a good time and you want to see Peter and Homer duke it out".|$|E
500|$|Eight years {{previous}} to the Once Upon a Time pilot (the two {{had just}} completed their work on Felicity, in 2002), Kitsis and Horowitz became inspired to write fairytales out of a love of [...] "mystery and excitement of exploring lots of different worlds." [...] They presented the premise to networks, but were refused because of its fantastical nature. The two learned from their time on Lost {{to look at the}} story in a different way, that [...] "character has to trump mythology"; they expanded, [...] "as people, you've got to see what the void in their heart or in their lives is to care about them... For us, this was as much about the character journeys <b>and</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>what</b> was ripped from them in coming to Storybrooke– going at it that way as opposed to making it the 'break-the-curse show.'" [...] Despite the comparisons and similarities to Lost, the writers intend them to be very different shows. To them, Lost concerned itself with redemption, while Once Upon a Time is about [...] "hope". Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof aided {{in the development of the}} series as a consultant, but had no official credit for the pilot.|$|E
500|$|The Ice Warriors were a {{well-known}} villain {{of the original}} Doctor Who series. They appeared alongside the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) in The Ice Warriors (1967) and The Seeds of Death (1969) and returned in the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) stories The Curse of Peladon (1972) and The Monster of Peladon (1974). Showrunner Steven Moffat had originally been hesitant {{to bring back the}} Ice Warriors, worrying that they were seen as [...] "the default condition for what people thought of as rubbish Doctor Who monsters— things that moved very, very slowly and spoke in a way that meant you couldn't hear a word they said." [...] Writer Mark Gatiss, however, was a fan of the Ice Warriors' stories and had been campaigning to bring them back. In a phone conversation with Moffat that was originally supposed to be about their show Sherlock, Gatiss pitched new and [...] "very clever ideas" [...] {{of what to do with}} the Ice Warriors, and Moffat agreed. What sold Moffat were the submarine setting <b>and</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>what</b> the Ice Warriors looked like underneath their suits. Gatiss felt that the Ice Warriors had a lot of gaps in their timeline and had not been featured in a while, which allowed a lot of room to explore them.|$|E

500|$|McFeely {{said the}} writing process began {{in the middle of}} 2011, around the release of The First Avenger, with him and Markus [...] "noodling on in hopes {{that there would be a}} second one and we did a lot of just {{throwing}} stuff at the wall <b>and</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>what</b> stuck". The first few months of writing were a back and forth process with Marvel, but after an outline was finished, the story did not change much. They opted to set the story in the present day, and, after [...] "experimenting with flashback elements for more period World War II stuff", decided to abandon the flashbacks as [...] "it became unwieldy." [...] The film would be [...] "Cap versus the world we all live in today", while averting excessive comedy regarding the hero's time displacement, as Markus considered the Captain [...] "the most adaptive man on the planet." [...] The tone would be more grounded in reality despite the advanced technology to contrast the fantasy elements from both the first Captain America and The Avengers. Despite that, the comic book origins guaranteed that the film would not have verisimilitude. This still proved a challenge in the reveal of Arnim Zola, that had to be extensively rewritten to convey how [...] "this grounded espionage paranoid thriller suddenly screeches to a halt and you switch gears really quickly with this ghost in the machine" [...] that introduces more science fiction elements.|$|E
2500|$|On October 14, 2012, Miller {{announced}} that his second album, Watching Movies with the Sound Off, {{would be released}} in early 2013.

Rousing himself each night toward dawn and climbing the mountain called Pangaion, he would await the sun's rising, so that he might see it first. Therefore, Dionysus, being angry with him, sent the Bassarides, as Aeschylus the tragedian says; they tore him apart and scattered the limbs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later {{critics of}} the century, such as T. S.

Eliot famously called Hamlet [...] "an artistic failure", and criticized the play as analogous to the Mona Lisa, in that both were overly enigmatic. Eliot targeted Hamlet's disgust with his mother as lacking an [...] "objective correlative"; viz., his feelings were excessive {{in the context of}} the play.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Palmer {{publicly}} criticised EastEnders, branding the storylines {{ridiculous and}} unbelievable and stating that she [...] "wouldn't {{go back to}} EastEnders". However, in October 2007 the BBC announced that Palmer would be returning to the soap as a full-time character; she made her comeback on-screen in April 2008. Palmer has commented [...] "I can't wait to explore what Bianca has been doing with her life <b>and</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>what</b> {{she is going to}} get up to next" [...] and executive producer of EastEnders, Diederick Santer, added, [...] "I'm delighted to welcome Patsy Palmer home to EastEnders.

2500|$|The [...] "random cutups" [...] {{from the}} Adler story {{that are part}} of the album's lyrics and liner notes were written by Bowie, who typed them into his Mac {{computer}} and then ran a custom program called the Verbasizer. The Verbasizer was a program written by Gracenote co-founder Ty Roberts, the program would cut up and reassemble Bowie's words electronically, much like he had done with paper, scissors and glue back in the 1970s. He would then look at the lyrics while the band played a song and decide [...] "whether I was going to sing, do a dialogue, or become a character. I would improvise with the band, really fast on my feet, getting from one line to another <b>and</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>what</b> worked."
