500|$|Following the character's {{diagnosis}} with bipolar disorder, her switching Summer's {{paternity test}} was heavily criticized by critics, {{who felt that}} the character still had not been repaired. About.com listed the paternity twist {{as one of the}} worst storylines of 2013 on the soap opera. Mental health advocate Arthur Gallant of The Huffington Post commended the show's initial portrayal of Sharon's bipolar disorder, writing: [...] "I praise the writers for their diligence in how mental illness has been depicted and feel the show has done their part in helping to eliminate mental health stigma." [...] Sara Bibel of Xfinity slammed Josh Griffith's writing, stating that he [...] "undid all his great work rehabilitating the character of Sharon" [...] in a [...] "character-destroying" [...] storyline. Garrett (writing for Highlight Hollywood this time) was livid with then-executive producer Jill Farren Phelps, who he labeled as a female misogynist, and strongly opposed to Sharon being turned into a villain [...] "with no good reason". Soap Opera Digest named the character of Sharon as the [...] "Most Ruined" [...] soap opera character in both 2012 and 2013, while in turn praising the performance of Case. In December 2014, Daytime Confidential described Sharon {{as one of the most}} [...] "drastically damaged" [...] characters in the history of the soap opera genre, and wrote, [...] "You name it, one head writer or another has had her do it. Kleptomania. Three baby daddies. Bipolar disorder. It was almost like a reward was passed out in the Y writing room anytime anyone came up with something more <b>awful</b> <b>to</b> have Sharon do." [...] Giddens criticized Charles Pratt Jr. in 2015 for enjoying writing Sharon as [...] "crazy", [...] "despite legions of fans demanding the bipolar character be given back her dignity". Writing for TV Insider, Michael Logan said in 2016 that fans of the character were tired of seeing her written as [...] "the liar, the villain, the nutcase, the doormat".|$|E
