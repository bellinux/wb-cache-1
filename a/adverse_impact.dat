5|$|Although {{women in}} industrialised {{countries}} have narrowed {{the gender gap}} in life expectancy and now live longer than men, {{in many areas of}} health they experience earlier and more severe disease with poorer outcomes. Gender remains an important social determinant of health, since women's health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty, employment, and family responsibilities. Women have long been disadvantaged in many respects such as social and economic power which restricts their access to the necessities of life including health care, and the greater the level of disadvantage, such as in developing countries, the greater <b>adverse</b> <b>impact</b> on health.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the California {{sea lion}} is {{protected}} {{on the federal}} Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), passed in 1972, which outlaws hunting, killing, capture, and harassment of the animal.

5|$|On {{the other}} side, the cement {{industry}} in Iran {{is one of}} the economic sectors that will be hit the hardest in Iran following of the subsidy reform plan, because many Iranian cement factories are energy inefficient (Notwithstanding possible adjustment and/or liberalization of commodities prices by the government during implementation).

30|$|As hypothesized, {{the binary}} logit {{regression}} model revealed that history of settlement, {{the difference in}} crop and forage production near Eucalyptus woodlot, and {{the distance between the}} houses of the respondents and the nearby access road positively affected local people’s knowledge on the <b>adverse</b> <b>impacts</b> of Eucalyptus woodlot (Table  5). The possible reason for the positive correlation of the history of settlement with local people’s knowledge on the <b>adverse</b> <b>impacts</b> of Eucalyptus woodlot might be attributed to people with long history in the area, who are worried about their environment. In addition, when the local people know much about the difference in crop and forage production near Eucalyptus woodlot, their knowledge to notice the <b>adverse</b> <b>impacts</b> of Eucalyptus woodlot would likely increase (Hailu 2002; Negasa et al. 2016; Negasa et al. 2017 b). As a result, they may likely develop good insights about the <b>adverse</b> <b>impacts</b> of Eucalyptus in the study site. Thus, history of settlement may {{have a positive effect on}} the <b>adverse</b> <b>impacts</b> of Eucalyptus in Gudo Beret Kebele. When the distance between the houses of the respondents and the nearby access road increases, people might not easily transport the wood products (e.g., poles, construction materials, and fuelwood) of Eucalyptus so that they will be worried about the <b>adverse</b> <b>impacts</b> of Eucalyptus woodlot on their environment.|$|R

5|$|For many net oil {{importing}} {{countries the}} 2000s energy crisis brought back concerns first raised during the 1973 oil crisis. For the United States, the other developed countries and emerging countries {{their dependence on}} foreign oil has revived concerns about their vulnerability to price shocks and supply disruption. Also, there have been concerns about the uncertainty surrounding peak oil production and the higher cost of extracting unconventional oil. A third issue that has been raised is the threat to national security because most proven oil reserves are concentrated in relatively few geographic locations, including some countries with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests. In addition, for many developing countries, and particularly for the poorest African countries, high oil prices have an <b>adverse</b> <b>impact</b> on the government budget and deteriorate their terms of trade thus jeopardizing their balance of payments, all leading to lower economic growth.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{their native}} habitat, elk and other deer species, {{especially}} white tails, {{were introduced in}} areas that previously had few if any large native ungulates. Brought to these countries for hunting and ranching for meat, hides and antler velvet, they have proven highly adaptable and have often had an <b>adverse</b> <b>impact</b> on local ecosystems. Elk and red deer were introduced to Argentina in the early 20th century. There they are now considered an invasive species, encroaching on Argentinian ecosystems where they compete for food with the indigenous Chilean huemul and other herbivores. This negative impact on native animal species has led the IUCN to identify the elk {{as one of the}} world's 100 worst invaders.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of deer to New Zealand {{began in the}} middle of the 19th century, and current populations are primarily European red deer, with only 15 percent being elk. There is significant hybridization of elk with the more numerous red deer to the extent that pure elk may no longer exist in the wild in New Zealand. These deer have had an <b>adverse</b> <b>impact</b> on forest regeneration of some plant species, as they consume more palatable species which are replaced with those that are less favored by the elk. The long-term impact will be an alteration of the types of plants and trees found, and in other animal and plant species dependent upon them. As in Chile and Argentina, the IUCN has declared that red deer and elk populations in New Zealand are an invasive species.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{construction}} projects have <b>adverse</b> <b>impacts</b> on the residents who live at {{a neighborhood of}} a construction project. In the literature, these <b>adverse</b> <b>impacts</b> are identified and the social cost of these <b>adverse</b> <b>impacts</b> are formalized. However, in all these studies, all <b>adverse</b> <b>impacts</b> are assumed to create nuisance at the same level, whereas the residents are more sensitive {{to some of these}} nuisances, on the other hand some of the nuisances which are considered in the social cost studies can be overlooked by the residents, and therefore this can cause misleading calculations of social cost. In order to overcome shortcoming of social cost studies, a study, which aims to identify the level of effects of each nuisance on the residents, is conducted by performing a questionnaire survey. 266 respondents are obtained {{at the end of the}} study, and the data obtained by questionnaire survey is analyzed by using descriptive analysis. According to this analysis, loss of peace and quietude of the neighborhood, cleanliness of the house, and degradation of ambient conditions are identified as the most disturbing nuisances. In addition, the country conditions and culture of the region is considered as important factors that play an important role in the intensity of <b>adverse</b> <b>impacts...</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2001, twenty-one {{northwest}} Washington tribes, {{joined by}} the United States filed a Request for Determination in U.S. District Court, asking the court {{to find that the}} State of Washington has a treaty-based duty to preserve fish runs and habitat sufficiently for the tribes to earn a “moderate living,” and sought to compel the state to repair or replace culverts that impede salmon migration. On August 22, 2007, the district court issued a summary judgment order, holding that while culverts impeding andromadous fish migration are not the only factor diminishing their upstream habitat, in building and maintaining culverts that impede salmon migration, Washington State had diminished the size of salmon runs within the case area and thereby violated its obligation under the Stevens Treaties. On March 29, 2013, the court issued an injunction ordering the state to significantly increase the effort for removing state-owned culverts that block habitat for salmon and steelhead, and to replace the state-owned culverts that have the greatest <b>adverse</b> <b>impact</b> on the habitat of andromadous fish by 2030.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{does not}} meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high {{concentration}} of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Considering the <b>adverse</b> <b>impact</b> on the lake water quality due to Eutrophication, anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism, a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months. The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations. The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater pollution load) and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run-off). During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent remedial actions to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation.|$|E

30|$|However, {{the binary}} logit {{regression}} model revealed {{that level of}} education and place of Eucalyptus plantation negatively correlated with local people’s knowledge on the <b>adverse</b> <b>impacts</b> of Eucalyptus woodlot in Gudo Beret Kebele (Table  5). The possible reason could be when the level of education increases, local people might be well conscious of how to manage and control the <b>adverse</b> <b>impacts</b> of Eucalyptus woodlot. Therefore, as compared to less educated people, more educated people would likely minimize the potential negative impacts of Eucalyptus woodlot on their environment. When {{the knowledge of the}} local people about the place of Eucalyptus plantation increases, it is clear {{that they will be able}} to control and manage the <b>adverse</b> <b>impacts</b> of Eucalyptus woodlot. Previous studies noted that knowledge on forest plantation plays a key and central role in Eucalyptus plantation management and development (e.g., Hailu et al. 2003; Bernard and Jurgen 2005; Ayele 2008; Tesfaye et al. 2012; Bekele 2015; Negasa et al. 2016). Generally, the present study had generated a lot of relevant knowledge on the <b>adverse</b> <b>impacts</b> of Eucalyptus woodlot on the environment. For example, the respondents argued that the <b>adverse</b> <b>impacts</b> of Eucalyptus woodlot can be managed or controlled if appropriate silvicultural activities, such as species selection, planting space, planting site selection, pruning, thinning, and harvesting operations are put in place. Previous studies also noted that the <b>adverse</b> <b>impacts</b> of Eucalyptus can be controlled if silvicultural and plantation management techniques are properly planned and implemented (e.g., Hailu 2002; Hailu et al. 2003; Bernard and Jurgen 2005; Bekele 2015).|$|R
