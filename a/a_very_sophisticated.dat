ARABSAT 2 B is a commercial geostationary telecommunications satellite {{owned and operated}} by the ARABSAT organization based in Riyadh Saudi Arabia. The satellite was built by Thales Alenia Space (Cannes, France) and launched in November 1996. It employs a standard bi-propellant chemical propulsion system. ARABSAT 2 B completed its design life of 12 years in 2008 with full functionality and is currently still in operation. The life limiting factor for this satellite is available propellant, hence the importance of a gauging method that determines propellant. It is shown that the TGM provides more accurate estimation of propellant remaining now than methods such as bookkeeping and PVT (Pressure-Volume-Temperature). The TGM (as other thermal methods) is based on a concept of measuring the thermal capacitance of a tank containing liquid fuel and pressurant gas by measuring the thermal response of the propellant tank to heating and comparing the observed temperature rise to simulation results.

It is not obvious what {{the exact nature of}} the conflict is supposed to be, because it is not obvious what the two doctrines amount to. But that there is some kind of conflict between moral realism and moral relativism is evidenced by the fact that some take moral relativism to be the straightforward denial of moral realism. David Brink, for example, baldly states that ‘Moral relativism is usually understood as a denial of realism or objectivity about ethics’ (Brink 1989, 43). This definitional thesis is wrong. Even so, in the case of morality at least the tension between the two seems clear enough. Why? The moral realist holds inter alia that there are objective truths in the moral domain, and further that these objective truths are not mere human artefacts, but are backed up by special kinds of facts. The moral relativist, on the other hand, claims that judgements of right and wrong, permissibility and obligation, and so on, are in an important sense socially constructed; that they are human artefacts, perhaps of <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sophisticate...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Roman Lincoln had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sophisticated</b> water supply. It was {{fed by the}} ‘‘Roaring Meg’’ {{spring to}} the North East {{of the city and}} then ran {{parallel}} with the Nettleham Road towards the N.E corner of the Upper Colonia. The ceramic pipes were encased in concrete that provided a waterproof seal and allowed the water to pass through the pipes under pressure. The course of the aqueduct had been well known {{from the start of the}} 18th century. William Stukeley had shown the line of the aqueduct on his plan of Lincoln in 1722. The Lincoln antiquary Thomas Sympson had written in the mid 18th century [...] "There must have been some contrivance for raising the water a good deal above its natural level before it would run to Lindum; the spring being evidently lower than the Town: and indeed there are some traces of a Tower, or some such building at the end of the Aquaeduct by the Spring, which one may suppose would have had a reservoir on its Top." [...] In 1782 the artist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm drew sections of the sheathed pipe and also where it emerged from the ground at the spring. Over the years further lengths of the aqueduct have been uncovered and the base for a watertank fed by the aqueduct discovered just inside the Roman Wall to the east of the Newport Arch. This is just to the north of Cottesford Place, where excavations in the 1960s revealed a probable Roma Bathhouse, which could have been supplied with water from this source. [...] Another pipeline, encased in concrete was found in 1857 by the Greestone Stairs, to the east of the wall, and this pipeline had presumably branched off from the aqueduct and supplied water to the Lower Colonia. Thompson calculated that it would be necessary to raise the water about 70 feet at the source at the ‘‘Roaring Meg’’ for there to be sufficient pressure for the water to reach the tank at the East Bight by the Newport Arch. This may imply that there was some form of water tower and the Romans may either have used some form of pump to raise the water, or a revolving bucket and chain system.|$|E
2500|$|After {{several years}} of {{retirement}} from the fashion industry, French designer Thierry Mugler served as the main costume designer for the tour.

She met with Mugler in Paris in September and started exchanging ideas with him, further designing costumes which were inspired by her love of music and life. She hired him as the designer for the tour costumes in November, 2008. Speaking about her collaboration, Knowles said, [...] "The best part about this tour is I'm working with Thierry Mugler, who is an icon and a legend, and I've been a fan." [...] Mugler wanted to capture the duality between being a woman and a warrior and understand these two sides with [...] own perception of both aspects while creating the costumes for Knowles and using the words [...] "Feminine. Free. Warrior. Fierce" [...] as inspiration. He felt, [...] "Sasha Fierce is another aspect of Beyoncé's personality, she is Fierce on stage and Beyoncé in real life... Beyoncé is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sophisticated</b> 'stage animal', which means that she is truly instinctive. Beyoncé expresses herself through the two aspects of her personality. On stage, there is Sasha Fierce and there is Beyoncé in her truest self." [...] He described the costumes as [...] "very elaborate" [...] and rooted in the songs' meanings. He conducted a 71-piece wardrobe for Knowles, her dancers and the band for the tour. For the shows, Knowles had ten different looks which were noted to be [...] "fierce" [...] as her onstage alter ego. She wore [...] "ferocious power-glam superheroine outfits for a one-two punch of femininity and fierceness". American fashion designer Chris March also collaborated with Knowles during the tour helping Mugler in the process of creating the costumes and making them usable for stage purposes as his expertise was execution of outfits. On July 23, 2009, March filled a lawsuit against Mugler for allegedly not paying him for the work he did on the wardrobe. Knowles' look captured a duality of soft and hard, combining bows with metal and incorporating fishnets, mismatched gloves and power shoulders into costumes that mirror Knowles' lyrics about [...] "all the single women" [...] femme fatales and power brokers in a [...] "high-tech Blade Runner world" [...] as stated by Michael Quintanilla of San Antonio Express-News. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone magazine noted that the wardrobe designs consisted of a variety of gold sparkly leotards, all form-fitting, light-reflecting and leg-baring.
