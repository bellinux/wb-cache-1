50|$|<b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus) is a {{saltwater}} fish {{that live in}} the North Pacific Ocean. <b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice</b> are right-eye flounders which live on the sandy bottoms of the continental shelf, up to 600 metres deep. Their geographic range is from the Gulf of Alaska in the east, to the Chukchi Sea in the north, to the Sea of Japan in the west. <b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice</b> feed mostly on polychaetes, but also eat amphipods and echiurans.|$|E
50|$|Most {{commercial}} fisheries do not target <b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice,</b> {{but many are}} caught as bycatch by commercial trawlers trying to catch other bottom fish. Thus, many <b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice</b> get caught anyway - so much so that, for example, the 2005 total allowable catch in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) was reached {{before the end of}} May of that year.|$|E
50|$|Most {{commercial}} fisheries do not target <b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice,</b> and bycatch by commercial trawlers targeting other groundfish {{is the sole}} source of significant harvest of this species. Large schools of <b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice</b> are commonly associated with schools of Yellowfin sole, and bycatch rates can reach relatively high levels. The 2005 total allowable catch in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) was reached {{before the end of}} May of that year.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Prior to 2001, the "other flatfish" species complex {{included}} <b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus). Flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) {{were part}} of the other flatfish complex until they were removed in 1995, and in recent years <b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice</b> was the dominant species of the complex and comprised 87 % of both the 2000 catch and the estimated 2001 trawl survey biomass. Because more biological information exists for <b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice</b> than for the remaining species of other flatfish, an age-structured population model was used to assess this stock. In contrast, survey biomass estimates are the principal data source used to assess the remaining other flatfish. In 2002, <b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice</b> were and removed from the other species complex and managed separately. Given the differences in biological information, assessment techniques, and management, it is appropriate to separate the assessment of <b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice</b> from the remaining other flatfish. This chapter considers the ass...|$|E
40|$|The stage-specific {{distribution}} of <b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice</b> (Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus) {{eggs in the}} southeastern Bering Sea was examined with collections made in mid-May in 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2006. Eggs {{in the early stages}} of development were found primarily offshore of the 40 -m isobath. Eggs in the middle and late stages of development were found inshore and offshore of the 40 -m isobath. There was some evidence that early-stage eggs occur deeper in the water column than late-stage eggs, although year-to-year variability in that trend was observed. Most eggs were in the later stages of development; therefore the majority of spawning is estimated to have occurred a few weeks before collection—probably April—and may be highly synchronized among local spawning areas. Results indicate that sampling with continuous underway fish egg collectors(CUFES) should be supplemented with sampling of the entire water column to ensure adequate samples of all egg stages of <b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice.</b> Data presented offer new information on the stage-dependent horizontal and vertical {{distribution of}} <b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice</b> eggs in the Bering Sea and provide further evidence that the early life history stages of this species are vulnerable to near-surface variations in hydrographical conditions and climate forcing...|$|E
40|$|<b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice,</b> Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus, {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{flatfishes}} in the eastern Bering Sea ecosystem and is most highly concentrated in the shallow continental shelf of the eastern Bering Sea. Annual commercial catches have ranged from less than 1, 000 metric tons (t) in 1963 to 62, 000 t in 1988. <b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice</b> is a relatively large flatfish averaging about 32 cm in length and 390 g in weight in commercial catches. They are distributed from nearshore waters to a depth of about 100 m in the eastern Bering Sea during summer, but move to deeper continental shelf waters in winter to escape sea ice and cold water temperatures. Being a long-lived species (> 30 years), they have a relatively low natural mortality rate estimated at 0. 20. Maturing at about age 7, <b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice</b> spawn from April through June on hard sandy substrates of the shelf region, primarily around the 100 m isobath. Prey items primarily include polychaetes and other marine worms. In comparison with other flatfish, <b>Alaska</b> <b>plaice</b> and rock sole, Pleuronectes bilineatus, have similar diets but different habitat preferences with separate areas of peak population density which may minimize interspecific competition. Yellowfin sole, Pleuronectes asper, while sharing similar habitat, differs from these two species because of the variety of prey items in its diet. Competition for food resources among the three species appears to be low. The resource has experienced light exploitation since 1963 and is currently in good condition. Based on the results of demersal trawl surveys and age-structured analyses, the exploitable biomass increased from 1971 through the mid- 1980 ’s before decreasing to the 1997 level of 500, 000 t. The recommended 1998 harvest level, Allowable Biological Catch, was calculated from the Baranov catch equation based on the FMSY harvest level and the projected 1997 biomass, resulting in a commercial harvest of 69, 000 t, or about 16...|$|E
