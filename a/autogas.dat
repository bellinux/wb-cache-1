5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG <b>Autogas</b> system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E
25|$|Propane is {{a cleaner}} burning, high {{performance}} fuel derived from multiple sources. It is known by many names including propane, LPG (liquified propane gas), LPA (liquid propane <b>autogas),</b> <b>Autogas</b> and others. Propane is a hydrocarbon fuel {{and is a}} member of the natural gas family.|$|E
25|$|Propane <b>autogas</b> is a {{domestically}} produced {{alternative fuel}} which {{costs less than}} conventional fuels. Over the past 30 years, propane <b>autogas</b> has cost, on average, 30 percent less than gasoline and 40 percent less than diesel. More than 90 percent is produced in the U.S. (and an additional 7 percent from Canada), which lessens American dependency on foreign oil. The fuel burns substantially cleaner than gasoline or diesel.|$|E
25|$|ROUSH CleanTech {{developed}} the industry's first propane <b>autogas</b> engine with {{nitrogen oxide emissions}} of 0.05 grams per brake horsepower-hour—below the current U.S. EPA limit of 0.2 g/bhp-hr.|$|E
25|$|Vehicles {{that use}} {{alternative}} fuels used in standard or modified internal combustion engines such as natural gas vehicles, neat ethanol vehicles, flexible-fuel vehicles, biodiesel-powered vehicles, propane <b>autogas,</b> and hydrogen vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Propane <b>autogas</b> is {{generated}} at the well alongside other {{natural gas and}} oil products. It is also a by-product of the refining processes which further increase the supply of Propane to the market.|$|E
25|$|By 2008, Roush had {{expanded}} into offering propane-autogas-fueled vehicles designed for fleet usage. The company product offerings include propane <b>autogas</b> fuel system technology for medium-duty Ford commercial vehicles, and Type A and Type C Blue Bird Corporation school buses. Most vehicle kits offer multiple tank configurations.|$|E
25|$|In {{a vehicle}} format, propane <b>autogas</b> can be {{retrofitted}} {{to almost any}} engine and provide fuel cost savings and lowered emissions while being more efficient as an overall system due to the large, pre-existing propane fueling infrastructure that does not require compressors and the resultant waste of other alternative fuels in well to wheel lifecycles.|$|E
25|$|Across the nation, {{companies}} such as Bimbo Bakeries, DISH, SuperShuttle and ThyssenKrupp Elevator; hundreds of school districts, including Broward County and Los Angeles Unified School District; and transit agencies such as SMART in Michigan, West Palm Beach Transit and Flint Mass Transit, have experienced reduced fuel and operating costs while lowering their carbon footprint with propane <b>autogas</b> vehicles.|$|E
25|$|As of 2017, ROUSH CleanTech has {{deployed}} almost 15,000 Ford {{trucks and}} vans and Blue Bird school buses fueled by propane <b>autogas</b> to fleets throughout the United States. More than 90 {{percent of all}} propane school buses currently operating in the U.S. are equipped with a ROUSH CleanTech fuel system. School districts choose propane over diesel to accommodate tighter budgets and help improve air quality.|$|E
25|$|The GLi was {{the most}} basic model Falcon, selling well with fleets. Its {{features}} list was identical {{to that of the}} previous model, which included Ford's straight-six engine, with an option of upgrading to the Windsor V8. The slightly more equipped Futura features ABS brakes, front power windows, cruise control and a number of luxury features, like back seat headrests and an enhanced sound system. To distinguish it from the GLi, body-coloured components replaced the black plastic type. Regardless of the model chosen, an optional dual fuel tank could be fitted to run on both <b>autogas</b> and petrol, with the transmission limited to the four-speed automatic.|$|E
25|$|Most cars {{in use in}} the 2010s are {{propelled}} by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the deflagration (rather than detonation) combustion of hydrocarbon fossil fuels, mostly gasoline (petrol) and diesel, {{as well as some}} <b>Autogas</b> and CNG. Hydrocarbon fuels cause air pollution and contribute to climate change and global warming. Rapidly increasing oil prices, concerns about oil dependence, tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for cars. Efforts to improve or replace existing technologies include the development of hybrid vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles. Vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries. Cars for racing or speed records have sometimes employed jet or rocket engines, but these are impractical for common use.|$|E
500|$|Bi-fuel {{vehicles}}. The term flexible-fuel vehicles {{is sometimes}} used to include other alternative fuel vehicles that can run with {{compressed natural gas}} (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG; also known as <b>autogas),</b> or hydrogen. However, all these vehicles actually are bi-fuel and not flexible-fuel vehicles, because they have engines that store the other fuel in a separate tank, and the engine runs on one fuel at a time. Bi-fuel vehicles {{have the capability to}} switch back and forth from gasoline to the other fuel, manually or automatically. The most common available fuel in the market for bi-fuel cars is natural gas (CNG), and by 2008 there were 9,6 million natural gas vehicles, led by Pakistan (2.0 million), Argentina (1.7 million), and Brazil (1.6 million). [...] Natural gas vehicles are a popular choice as taxicabs in the main cities of Argentina and Brazil. Normally, standard gasoline vehicles are retrofitted in specialized shops, which involve installing the gas cylinder in the trunk and the CNG injection system and electronics.|$|E
2500|$|Roush Enterprises is {{the parent}} company for Roush Racing as well as Roush Industries, a {{freelance}} engineering firm; Roush Performance, an automotive aftermarket development company; and ROUSH CleanTech, a manufacturer of propane <b>autogas</b> fuel systems, all headquartered in Livonia, Michigan. [...] His companies employ more than 2,000 people throughout North America and Europe.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, ROUSH CleanTech began {{production}} on propane autogas-fueled vehicles for Frito-Lay. In 2012, the company started to manufacture propane fuel systems for Blue Bird Type C and Micro Bird Type A school buses. In 2017, ROUSH CleanTech developed the first propane <b>autogas</b> engine available in class 4 – 7 vehicles certified to the California Air Resources Board’s optional low nitrogen oxide level of [...]05 g/bhp-hr.|$|E
2500|$|Propane {{delivers}} an {{octane rating}} between 104 and 112 {{depending on the}} composition of the butane/propane ratios of the mixture. Propane <b>autogas</b> in a liquid injection format captures the phase change from liquid to gas state within the cylinder of the combustion engine producing an [...] "intercooler" [...] effect, reducing the cylinder temperature and increasing air density. The resultant effect allows more advance on the ignition cycle and a more efficient engine combustion.|$|E
2500|$|One popular [...] "upgrade" [...] {{to older}} (and even new) Yugos is <b>autogas</b> (LPG) {{conversion}} which has gained widespread popularity in Serbia. Because most Yugos do not feature fuel injection, converting them to LPG is cheap and easy, and is paid off very quickly. One drawback of such conversions {{is that an}} already small trunk becomes almost useless, since an LPG tank takes up space. Such converted cars achieve better reliability since use of an unreliable gasoline pump is avoided. However, some cars have starting problems in very cold weather, because of improper LPG installation.|$|E
2500|$|Most minibuses are Toyota Coasters, {{but a new}} and {{environmentally}} friendly Iveco Daily Green minibus has also been introduced as {{part of one of}} the many recent schemes in Hong Kong to increase the quality of the buses. Most of the buses run on <b>Autogas</b> (liquefied petroleum gas or LPG). This type of fuel is not only cheaper, but also reduces emissions. [...] The transport commission is making further efforts to reduce emissions by providing incentives for bus drivers to make the switch to even more efficient electric vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|Vehicles {{running on}} <b>autogas</b> or {{compressed}} natural gas must have a metal diamond with a white lettering LPG on a retro-reflective red background or metal disc with white lettering CNG on red background. The tag must be mechanically fixed (and is usually riveted) onto both of the registration plates. If multiple gas tanks are fitted to vehicle, multiple tags are required – one tag for each tank installed. Subsequently, vehicle manufacturers who manufacture cars with LPG as standard fitting, provide LPG stickers already stuck to the vehicle's registration plate areas, and some state and territory registration authorities also are producing plastic [...] "flat" [...] printed registration plates, and therefore need to provide LPG stickers to avoid damage to the plates if drilled for pop rivets.|$|E

50|$|Turkey has {{the highest}} {{percentage}} of <b>autogas</b> vehicles in the world. Some 37% of passenger cars run on <b>autogas,</b> and <b>autogas</b> consumption now exceeds petrol consumption. The Turkish government regulated the <b>autogas</b> price to provide consumers with a net economic advantage of 20-35%. As of the end of 2010, there are 8,500 <b>autogas</b> fueling stations around the country and market growth has been supported by a network of 1,000 licensed conversion shops.|$|E
50|$|<b>Autogas</b> (called GLP in Spain) was {{restricted}} {{by law to}} taxis and public transport buses for many decades. In recent years the market has been liberalised and <b>autogas</b> has been made available {{to all kinds of}} vehicles. The Spanish government subsidises the installations of <b>autogas</b> in cars and the purchase of brand-new factory-installed <b>autogas</b> cars. There are many factory-installed <b>autogas</b> brand-new cars available for purchase. While the number of autogas-powered cars is increasing every year, it is still low. The main barrier for a major expansion of the number of autogas-powered cars is that the number of refuelling stations for <b>autogas</b> is also still low, but it is increasing quickly too. By the end of 2015 there were 342 stations selling <b>autogas</b> in Spain. Spain is currently the only country using the new EU-wide common standard connector for <b>autogas,</b> the Euroconnector or Euronozzle adapter.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Autogas</b> is on {{the rise}} in the United States. As of February 2012, the United States has more than 147,000 <b>autogas</b> {{vehicles}} on the road, accounting for just 2% of the world’s total and as of June 2013, the United States has 2,843 <b>autogas</b> fueling stations, making it easier for drivers to refuel across the country. The U.S. Department of Energy has a website that <b>autogas</b> drivers can easily locate <b>autogas</b> fueling stations near them as well as other alternative fuels. The cost of converting a car to use petrol or <b>autogas</b> at a turn of a knob starts from [...] <b>Autogas</b> use by car drivers can help the United States to reduce dependence on foreign oil as 90% of all U.S. <b>Autogas</b> is produced in the U.S.In 2005, a provision was enacted that placed a 50 cent per gallon tax credit on propane <b>autogas</b> as part of H.R. 4853, making it $1 per gallon cheaper than petrol on average. The alternative fuel credit was extended in 2010 and remained in effect until the end of 2011.|$|E
50|$|Poland {{has one of}} {{the oldest}} and most {{successful}} <b>autogas</b> markets in Europe. It is the country with the highest rate of LPG use per capita, higher even than Italy. In 2011, there were 6050 <b>autogas</b> refuelling stations and 2,500,000 <b>autogas</b> vehicles on the road. The number of <b>autogas</b> vehicles in Poland increased by 8% in 2011, however <b>autogas</b> sales decreased by 3.7%. This is mostly due to older vehicles being replaced with newer, more fuel efficient ones. Almost half of Poland's LPG comes from Russia.As of 2011, the number of <b>autogas</b> vehicles exceeded 2,500,000. Most of the Polish distributors offer brand-new factory installed LPG cars of mostly all brands.|$|E
50|$|This big {{conversion}} is {{the success}} of Turkish <b>autogas</b> kits and <b>autogas</b> tanks manufacturers starting from 1995, even though <b>autogas</b> use became legal in 2000. At the same time, Italian companies also supplied systems through several companies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Autogas</b> is {{very popular}} in Italy. With over 1,000,000 <b>autogas</b> {{vehicles}} on the road, {{it is the second}} largest <b>autogas</b> market in the European Union, after Poland. Italy {{was one of the first}} countries in the world to introduce <b>autogas,</b> which happened in the 1950s. In the first half of 2010 alone, more than 170,000 new <b>autogas</b> cars were registered. General Motors has been especially successful in Italy, with two-thirds of the vehicles sold in 2008 being autogas-capable.Self fill is not permitted in Italy.|$|E

50|$|<b>Autogas</b> {{consumption}} in China has grown rapidly since the 1990s, has slowed {{down in the}} early 2000s, but has started to grow again in recent years. In 2009, <b>autogas</b> refuelling stations have spread to 25 cities {{and has become a}} major alternative fuel in China. Motorcycles account for {{a large portion of the}} <b>autogas,</b> with over 260,000 <b>autogas</b> motorcycles in Shanghai alone. In Shenyang, the local government is encouraging public transport to convert to <b>autogas,</b> and as of 2009 over 160,000 taxicabs run on the fuel as well as over 2,500 buses. The city of Guangzhou accounted for 46.56% of national <b>autogas</b> {{consumption in}} 2009. Only 24% of China's Liquefied Petroleum Gas is produced domestically.|$|E
50|$|As of 2013, Japan {{has about}} 280,000 <b>autogas</b> {{vehicles}} on the road, which is less than in recent years. However, the number of <b>autogas</b> vehicles on Japan's roads has been very unstable. The first <b>autogas</b> taxicabs were introduced in Japan in the 1960s and 1970s. With {{a sharp decline in}} the 1990s, the number started to rise again in 2003. Between 2004 and 2010, the number dropped. The vast majority of <b>autogas</b> vehicles on Japanese roads are taxicabs or commercial vehicles. This is why, in 2010, the Japan LP Gas Association started an initiative to encourage corporations and motorists alike to switch to <b>autogas</b> vehicles. The initiative involves 27,000 Japanese retailers to introduce an <b>autogas</b> vehicle into their fleet every three years. Many of these corporations already have <b>autogas</b> vehicles, but Makoto Arahata from the Japanese LP Gas Association says that there is still much room for improvement.|$|E
50|$|<b>Autogas</b> {{was very}} popular in Ireland during the early 1980s, and the country had a large and {{extensive}} network of refueling points. It proved popular at the time particularly as Ireland was in a deep recession {{for much of the}} 1980s. However <b>autogas</b> fell out of favor in the late 1990s and 2000s due to unreliable early <b>autogas</b> systems and as the country experienced massive economic growth and unprecedented wealth demand for conversions and <b>autogas</b> subsequently dwindled.|$|E
50|$|The {{road tax}} on <b>autogas</b> {{vehicles}} can {{be up to}} 2 times that of petrol powered vehicles. On the modern third generation (G3) <b>autogas</b> systems, the difference on tax is zero for cars up to 850 kg, but increases for heavier cars. Compare the diesel tax, which is twice the petrol tax. Because the price of <b>autogas</b> {{is less than half}} that of petrol, fitting a car with an <b>autogas</b> system is economically viable after around 10,000 km/year.|$|E
50|$|It was {{estimated}} that France would have over 62,500 <b>autogas</b> {{vehicles on the}} road {{by the end of}} 2010. By the end of 2003, there were an estimated 190,000 <b>autogas</b> vehicles in use with almost 1,900 refuelling stations.

50|$|In Germany, {{the fuel}} is called <b>Autogas</b> as well (CNG {{is known as}} Erdgas). There were 6,700 fuel {{stations}} selling <b>autogas</b> in 2014, supplying about 500,000 registered gas-fueled cars (1.1 percent of all cars in Germany). mylpg.eu lists 7.240 stations in 2016. In addition to filling stations, numerous suppliers of industrial gas run dedicated <b>autogas</b> stations on their premises. Most filling pumps use the ACME adapter but DISH can also be found. Special fuel tax rates make <b>autogas</b> rather cheap in Germany (about 0,52 € per litre while 95-octane unleaded is 1,40 € per litre).|$|E
