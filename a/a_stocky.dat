5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} (Sitta carolinensis) {{is a small}} songbird of the nuthatch family which breeds in old-growth woodland {{across much}} of temperate North America. It is <b>a</b> <b>stocky</b> bird, with a large head, short tail, powerful bill, and strong feet. The upperparts are pale blue-gray, and the face and underparts are white. It has a black cap and a chestnut lower belly. The nine subspecies differ mainly in {{the color of the}} body plumage.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} or brown owl (Strix aluco) is <b>a</b> <b>stocky,</b> {{medium-sized}} owl {{commonly found in}} woodlands across much of Eurasia. Its underparts are pale with dark streaks, and the upperparts are either brown or grey. Several of the eleven recognised subspecies have both variants. The nest is typically in a tree hole where it can protect its eggs and young against potential predators. This owl is non-migratory and highly territorial. Many young birds starve if they cannot find a vacant territory once parental care ceases.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird is {{unlikely}} to be mistaken for any other mimid species, there are several other black birds — including the melodious blackbird, the bronzed cowbird and the giant cowbird — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion. All are birds of more open habitats. The melodious blackbird is larger and longer tailed; it has dark eyes and <b>a</b> <b>stocky</b> bill with an evenly curved culmen. The bronzed cowbird is thicker necked than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish gloss to its plumage; its eye is bright red rather than dark red. The giant cowbird is considerably larger, and is relatively longer tailed and thicker necked than is the catbird.|$|E

50|$|During his youth, he had {{a weight}} problem. It wasn't until just prior to The Kids in the Hall in the late 1980s that he went from {{overweight}} to rather skinny. Several sketches and monologues allude to the issue, and <b>a</b> <b>stockier</b> McDonald {{can be seen in}} archival footage on The Kids in the Hall on DVD box sets.|$|R

5|$|The Australian swellshark has <b>a</b> <b>stocky,</b> rounded {{body that}} tapers {{significantly}} to the short caudal peduncle. The head comprises {{no more than a}} fifth of the total length and is broad and moderately flattened, with a very short, thick, blunt snout. The nostrils are divided into small incurrent and excurrent openings by short, triangular flaps of skin that do not reach the mouth. The mouth is extremely large, without furrows at the corners. The teeth are numerous and small with multiple cusps; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. The large, oval eyes are placed somewhat on the upper surface of the head, and have rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and ridges underneath.|$|E
5|$|With <b>a</b> <b>stocky,</b> {{powerful}} build, the Exmoor pony {{is strong}} for its height, and {{noted for its}} hardiness and endurance. The chest is deep and the back broad, the croup level. The legs are short, with good bone and hard hooves. Although many sources state that the Exmoor has a distinctly different jaw structure from other horse breeds, which includes the beginnings of development of a seventh molar, this is a misunderstanding based on an incorrect translation of a German study. The study, when properly translated, refers to a feature, found in multiple horse breeds and perhaps all animals with sizable lower jaws, {{that appears to be}} an extra branch of blood supply in the area. While an extra tooth may have eventually developed from this extra blood supply, its frequency among the general horse population makes its appearance in the Exmoor pony unremarkable.|$|E
25|$|The common clownfish is a {{small fish}} which grows up to 11cm (4.3 inches). Its body has <b>a</b> <b>stocky</b> {{appearance}} and oval shape. It is compressed laterally, with a round profile.|$|E
50|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the largest}} and most {{powerful}} predators in vertebrate history, C. megalodon probably had a profound impact on the structure of marine communities. Fossil remains suggest that this giant shark reached a length of 18 m, and also indicate that it had a cosmopolitan distribution. Scientists suggest that C. megalodon looked like <b>a</b> <b>stockier</b> version of the great white shark, Carcharodon carcharias.|$|R

50|$|The aquatic nymph (larva) has <b>a</b> <b>stockier,</b> shorter, body {{than the}} adult. It lacks wings, {{the eyes are}} smaller, the {{antennae}} longer, and the head is less mobile than in the adult. The mouthparts are modified, with the labium being adapted into a unique prehensile organ for grasping prey. Damselfly nymphs breathe through external gills on the abdomen, while dragonfly nymphs respire through an organ in their rectum.|$|R

5000|$|Schefflera arboricola: The Hawaiian {{umbrella}} tree is a popular, hardy houseplant that {{is ideal for}} irregular, banyan or roots-on-rock forms. Since it can sprout on old wood, an old specimen can be pruned back to <b>a</b> <b>stockier</b> shape with thick trunk and roots. It tolerates root exposure very well, is drought-resistant and requires a moderate amount of light. Under high humidity conditions, it produces aerial roots and can therefore be shaped as a banyan tree.|$|R

50|$|In Daria's first {{incarnation}} as {{a recurring}} character on Beavis and Butt-Head, she formed an intelligent female foil {{to the two}} main characters. She went through three different outfits, had <b>a</b> <b>stockier</b> figure, and initially was a more expressive character; her iconic monotone voice would only develop over time. She would become more sardonic over time, but showed early on that she could hold her own against the two and could react fast to their antics.|$|R
5000|$|Crassula ovata: The jade {{plant is}} a very robust and drought-resistant house plant. The {{miniature}} cultivars like the baby jade plant (C. ovata arborescens) is considered the best plant for a first bonsai. This plant will sprout on old wood. Thus, an old specimen can be pruned back to <b>a</b> <b>stockier</b> shape with thick trunk. It is kept dry in winter, placed outdoors in summer for full growth. Its roots are thin and cannot be exposed.|$|R
25|$|Anatomically, the {{wolverine}} is <b>a</b> <b>stocky</b> {{and muscular}} animal. With short legs, broad and rounded head, small eyes and short rounded ears, it more closely resembles a bear {{than it does}} other mustelids. Though its legs are short, its large, five-toed paws with crampon-like claws and plantigrade posture enable them to climb up and over steep cliffs, trees and snow-covered peaks with relative ease.|$|E
25|$|Ponies {{are often}} {{distinguished}} by their phenotype, <b>a</b> <b>stocky</b> body, dense bone, round shape and well-sprung ribs. They {{have a short}} head, large eyes and small ears.

They have strong hooves and grow a heavier hair coat, seen in a thicker mane and tail {{as well as a}} particularly heavy winter coat.|$|E
25|$|All puffin {{species have}} {{predominantly}} black or {{black and white}} plumage, <b>a</b> <b>stocky</b> build, and large beaks. They shed the colourful outer parts of their bills after the breeding season, leaving a smaller and duller beak. Their short wings are adapted for swimming with a flying technique under water. In the air, they beat their wings rapidly (up to 400 times per minute) in swift flight, often flying low over the ocean's surface.|$|E

25|$|Almost all vipers have keeled scales, <b>a</b> <b>stocky</b> build {{with a short}} tail, and due to the {{location}} of the venom glands, a triangle-shaped head distinct from the neck. The great majority have vertically elliptical, or slit-shaped, pupils that can open wide to cover most of the eye or close almost completely, which helps them to see {{in a wide range of}} light levels. Typically, vipers are nocturnal and ambush their prey.|$|E
25|$|According to Hindu legend, Dakṣa (Sanskrit: दक्ष, lit. able, dexterous, or honest one {{is one of}} {{the sons}} of Lord Brahma, who, after {{creating}} the ten Manas Putras, created Daksha, Dharma, Kamadeva and Agni from his right thumb, chest, heart and eyebrows respectively.
