5000|$|Bellcore (subsequently Telcordia Technologies) {{developed}} the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Network</b> (AIN) as the variant of Intelligent Network for North America, and performed the standardization of the AIN {{on behalf of}} the major US operators. The original goal of AIN was AIN 1.0, which was specified in the early 1990s (AIN Release 1, Bellcore SR-NWT-002247, 1993). AIN 1.0 proved technically infeasible to implement, which led to the definition of simplified AIN 0.1 and AIN 0.2 specifications. In North America, Telcordia SR-3511 (originally known as TA-1129+) and GR-1129-CORE protocols serve to link switches with the IN systems such as Service Control Points (SCPs) or Service Nodes. SR-3511 details a TCP/IP-based protocol which directly connects the SCP and Service Node.

5000|$|When {{telephone}} exchanges were mechanical, a tap {{had to be}} installed by technicians, linking circuits together to route the audio signal from the call. Now that many exchanges have been converted to digital technology, tapping is far simpler and can be ordered remotely by computer. This central office switch wiretapping technology using the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Network</b> (AIN) was invented by Wayne Howe and Dale Malik at BellSouth's Advanced Technology R&D group in 1995 and was issued as US Patent #5,590,171. [...] Telephone services provided by cable TV companies also use digital switching technology. If the tap is implemented at a digital switch, the switching computer simply copies the digitized bits that represent the phone conversation to a second line and {{it is impossible to}} tell whether a line is being tapped. A well-designed tap installed on a phone wire can be difficult to detect. In some instances some law enforcement may be able to even access a mobile phone's internal microphone even while it isn't actively being used on a phone call (unless the battery is removed or drained).

40|$|Local Number Portability (LNP) {{remains one}} of the {{challenging}} technical hurdles toward true competition in the local exchange. While short term solutions, such as NPA overlays and remote call forwarding exist, longer term solutions are still in the developmental and early implementation stages.

The novelty of our approach consists of introducing a declarative specification layer, which is used for the construction of the desired services according to global constraints guaranteeing executability and other consistency conditions. These constraints are the basis for an on-line verification via model checking during the interactive service design process. Important for the success of the method is the high performance and the availability of diagnostic information in the case of failure: Several hundred constraints must be checked in real-time, and the diagnostic information must reflect the responsible constraint violation as concisely as possible, while preserving as much of the structure of the developed service as possible.

40|$|New network architectures, {{such as the}} Intelligent Network (IN), {{have evolved}} in {{response}} to the changing needs and demands for advanced and sophisticated telecommunications services. However, as more services are introduced into the network, a new problem of interactions between various services/features, becomes more prominent. This problem arises when multiple services or features interfere with each other and produce unexpected results, which disturb the users. This thesis presents my work in modeling features and detecting feature interactions using Message Sequence Charts (MSCs). The modeling technique is based on the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Network</b> (AIN) architecture and call models. To effectively detect feature interactions, we propose an MSC feature specification style which embodies several important aspects of features directly related to feature interactions. Based on the modeling of features using the specification style, we propose a new approach for detecting feature interactions. This approach includes definitions, classification of feature interactions, and specific detection algorithms for various types of interactions. We developed a prototyped feature interaction detection tool to implement our approach. With this tool, we are able to detect many interactions described in the Bellcore feature interaction benchmark. Our detection technique has maintained its consistency and accuracy in detecting these interactions. However, some limitations of our approach prevent us from detecting certain types of interactions. Combining our feature specification style, detection approach and tool, we propose a general framework for feature specification and interaction detection for IN services...|$|E
