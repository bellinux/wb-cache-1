5|$|Silicon is {{a common}} {{impurity}} in diamond films grown by chemical vapor deposition and it originates either from silicon substrate or from silica windows or walls of the CVD reactor. It was also observed in natural diamonds in dispersed form. Isolated silicon defects have been detected in diamond lattice through the sharp optical <b>absorption</b> <b>peak</b> at 738nm and electron paramagnetic resonance. Similar to other large impurities, the major form of silicon in diamond has been identified with a Si-vacancy complex (semi-divacancy site). This center is a deep donor having an ionization energy of 2 eV, and thus again is unsuitable for electronic applications.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{sorts of}} light receptors in a bird’s eye, rods and cones. Rods, which contain the visual pigment {{rhodopsin}} are better for night vision {{because they are}} sensitive to small quantities of light. Cones detect specific colours (or wavelengths) of light, so they are more important to colour-orientated animals such as birds. Most birds are tetrachromatic, possessing four types of cone cells each with a distinctive maximal <b>absorption</b> <b>peak.</b> In some birds, the maximal <b>absorption</b> <b>peak</b> of the cone cell responsible for the shortest wavelength extends to the ultraviolet (UV) range, making them UV-sensitive. In addition to that, the cones at bird's retina are arranged in a characteristic form of spatial distribution, known as hyperuniform distribution, which maximizes its light and color absorption. This form of spatial distributions are only observed {{as a result of}} some optimization process, which in this case can be described in terms of bird's evolutionary history.|$|E
25|$|By far {{the most}} {{abundant}} cone pigment in every bird species examined is the long-wavelength form of iodopsin, which absorbs at wavelengths near 570nm. This is roughly the spectral region occupied by the red- and green-sensitive pigments in the primate retina, and this visual pigment dominates the colour sensitivity of birds. In penguins, this pigment appears to have shifted its <b>absorption</b> <b>peak</b> to 543nm, presumably an adaptation to a blue aquatic environment.|$|E

These <b>absorption</b> <b>peaks</b> were attributed to F color centers and O- hole centers, respectively. Owing to more oxygen vacancies and color centers in H- 2 -annealed Y 2 SiO 5 crystal than that in as-grown Y 2 SiO 5 crystal after gamma-irradiation, the additional <b>absorption</b> <b>peaks</b> were more intense in the former than that in the latter.

In addition, the results reflect an important characteristic of the degradation of the silicone rubber insulation bushing: <b>absorption</b> <b>peaks</b> of Si–C bond decline much faster than <b>absorption</b> <b>peaks</b> of Si–O bond, which demonstrates that the fracture on the side-chain groups (mainly Si–(CH 3) 2) are much more than the backbone of the silicone rubber (Chen et al. 2015).|$|R

25|$|Low-{{frequency}} {{radio waves}} travel easily through brick and stone and VLF even penetrates sea-water. As the frequency rises, absorption effects become more important. At microwave or higher frequencies, absorption by molecular resonances {{in the atmosphere}} (mostly from water, H2O and oxygen, O2) {{is a major factor}} in radio propagation. For example, in the 58–60GHz band, there is a major <b>absorption</b> <b>peak</b> which makes this band useless for long-distance use. This phenomenon was first discovered during radar research in World War II. Above about 400GHz, the Earth's atmosphere blocks most of the spectrum while still passing some - up to UV light, which is blocked by ozone - but visible light and some of the near-infrared is transmitted.|$|E
25|$|Each cone {{of a bird}} or reptile {{contains}} a coloured oil droplet; these no longer exist in mammals. The droplets, which contain high concentrations of carotenoids, are placed so that light passes through them before reaching the visual pigment. They act as ﬁlters, removing some wavelengths and narrowing the absorption spectra of the pigments. This reduces the response overlap between pigments and increases the number of colours that a bird can discern. Six types of cone oil droplets have been identified; five of these have carotenoid mixtures that absorb at different wavelengths and intensities, and the sixth type has no pigments. The cone pigments with the lowest maximal <b>absorption</b> <b>peak,</b> including those that are UV-sensitive, possess the 'clear' or 'transparent' type of oil droplets with little spectral tuning effect.|$|E

40|$|The low-frequency {{magneto-optical}} {{properties of}} bilayer Bernal graphene are studied by the tight-binding model with four most important interlayer interactions taken into account. Since {{the main features}} of the wave functions are well depicted, the Landau levels {{can be divided into}} two groups based on the characteristics of the wave functions. These Landau levels lead to four categories of <b>absorption</b> <b>peaks</b> in the optical absorption spectra. Such <b>absorption</b> <b>peaks</b> own complex optical selection rules and these rules can be reasonably explained by the characteristics of the wave functions. In addition, twin-peak structures, regular frequency-dependent absorption rates and complex field-dependent frequencies are also obtained in this work.

25|$|Baltic amber {{yields on}} dry {{distillation}} succinic acid, the proportion varying from about 3% to 8%, and being greatest {{in the pale}} opaque or bony varieties. The aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid. Baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid, hence the name succinite. Succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3, which is rather {{greater than that of}} many other fossil resins. Its specific gravity varies from 1.05 to 1.10. It can be distinguished from other ambers via IR spectroscopy due to a specific carbonyl <b>absorption</b> <b>peak.</b> IR spectroscopy can detect the relative age of an amber sample. Succinic acid may not be an original component of amber, but rather a degradation product of abietic acid.|$|E
25|$|These photosystems are light-driven redox centers, each {{consisting}} of an antenna complex that uses chlorophylls and accessory photosynthetic pigments such as carotenoids and phycobiliproteins to harvest light {{at a variety}} of wavelengths. Each antenna complex has between 250 and 400 pigment molecules and the energy they absorb is shuttled by resonance energy transfer to a specialized chlorophyll a at the reaction center of each photosystem. When either of the two chlorophyll a molecules at the reaction center absorbs energy, an electron is excited and transferred to an electron-acceptor molecule. Photosystem I contains a pair of chlorophyll a molecules, designated P700, at its reaction center that maximally absorbs 700nm light. Photosystem II contains P680 chlorophyll that absorbs 680nm light best (note that these wavelengths correspond to deep red – see the visible spectrum). The P is short for pigment and the number is the specific <b>absorption</b> <b>peak</b> in nanometers for the chlorophyll molecules in each reaction center.|$|E
2500|$|This {{technique}} complements X-ray crystallography {{in that it}} {{is frequently}} applicable to molecules in a liquid or liquid crystal phase, whereas crystallography, as the name implies, is performed on molecules in a solid phase. Though nuclear magnetic resonance is used to study solids, extensive atomic-level molecular structural detail is especially challenging to obtain in the solid state. There is little signal averaging by thermal motion in the solid state, where most molecules can only undergo restricted vibrations and rotations at room temperature, each in a slightly different electronic environment, therefore exhibiting a different NMR <b>absorption</b> <b>peak.</b> Such a variation in the electronic environment of the resonating nuclei results in a blurring of the observed spectra—which is often only a broad Gaussian band for non-quadrupolar spins in a solid- thus making the interpretation of such [...] "dipolar" [...] and [...] "chemical shift anisotropy" [...] (CSA) broadened spectra either very difficult or impossible.|$|E

40|$|We {{show how}} {{coupling}} to an Einstein phonon ω_E affects the <b>absorption</b> <b>peaks</b> {{seen in the}} optical conductivity of graphene under a magnetic field B. The energies and widths of the various lines are shifted, and additional peaks arise in the spectrum. Some of these peaks are Holstein sidebands, resulting from the transfer of spectral weight in each Landau level (LL) into phonon-assisted peaks in the spectral function. Other additional <b>absorption</b> <b>peaks</b> result from transitions involving split LLs, which occur when a LL falls sufficiently close to a peak in the self-energy. We establish the selection rules for the additional transitions and characterize the additional <b>absorption</b> <b>peaks.</b> For finite chemical potential, spectral weight is asymmetrically distributed about the Dirac point; we discuss how this causes an asymmetry in the transitions due to left- and right-handed circularly polarized light and therefore oscillatory behavior in the imaginary part of the off-diagonal Hall conductivity. We also find that the semiclassical cyclotron resonance region is renormalized by an effective-mass factor but is not directly affected by the additional transitions. Last, we discuss how the additional transitions can manifest in broadened, rather than split, <b>absorption</b> <b>peaks</b> due to large scattering rates seen in experiment.
