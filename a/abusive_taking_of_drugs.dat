500|$|Commentator and Simpson's {{close friend}} David Saunders stated in his 1971 book, Cycling in the Sixties, that {{although}} he did not condone Simpson's use <b>of</b> <b>drugs,</b> he thought it was not the reason for his death. He said: [...] "I am quite convinced that Simpson killed himself because he just did not know when to stop. All his racing life he had punished his frail body, pushing it to the limits of endurance with his tremendous will-power and single-mindedness and, on Mont Ventoux, he pushed it too far, perhaps the drug easing the pain of it all." [...] Saunders {{went on to say that}} Simpson was not alone in the <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> in professional cycling and that the authorities ignored their use. His opinion was that Simpson did not take drugs to gain an unfair advantage, but because [...] "he was not going to be beaten by a pill".|$|R

40|$|The causes {{leading to}} faulty <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> {{prescribed}} <b>drugs</b> by elderly patients are identified and reviewed with suggestions concerning future improvements. There is considerable {{interest in the}} problems <b>of</b> the elderly <b>taking</b> <b>drugs</b> correctly and appropriately. A recent survey (Parkin et al. 1976) showed that these problems that have long been known in geriatric practice have now been noted by general physicians. This review was undertaken when an occupational therapist in a geriatric unit team noted that, although patients and their relatives were taught methods of dressing, toileting, shaving, bathing, eating, walking, transferring to a chair, wheelchair mobility and communication by the occupational therapist, physiotherapist and speech therapist, no advice or teaching was given concerning the accurate <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>drugs</b> prescribed. The results of a detailed investigation are reported elsewhere (Atkinson, Gibson & Andrews 1978).

40|$|Background: Hypothyroidism is a {{clinical}} condition associated with {{low levels of}} thyroid hormones with raised TSH.

Objectives: The present study was done to evaluate the clinical and electro-physiological findings in hypothyroid patients in order to evaluate the neuromuscular dysfunction as well as motor neuropathy. Method: In this study, 70 subjects with the age range from 20 to 50 years of both sexes were included of whom 40 hypothyroids were taken in study group (B) with the duration of 6 months to 5 years and 30 healthy euthyroid subjects were taken as control (Group A).

50|$|Although {{there are}} various methods <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>drugs,</b> {{injection}} is favoured by some users as the full effects <b>of</b> the <b>drug</b> are experienced very quickly, typically in five to ten seconds. It also bypasses first-pass metabolism in the liver, resulting in higher bioavailability and efficiency for many drugs (such as morphine or diacetylmorphine/heroin; roughly two-thirds of which is destroyed in the liver when consumed orally) than oral ingestion would, meaning users get a stronger (yet shorter-acting) effect from the same amount <b>of</b> the <b>drug.</b> This shorter, more intense high {{can lead to a}} dependency—both physical and psychological—developing more quickly than with other methods <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> <b>drugs.,</b> there were 13.2 million people worldwide who used injection <b>drugs,</b> <b>of</b> which 22% are from developed countries.|$|R

40|$|Psychostimulant {{exposure}} {{has been}} shown to cause molecular and cellular changes in prefrontal cortex. It has been hypothesized that these drug-induced changes might affect the operation of prefrontal-limbic circuits, disrupting their normal role in controlling behavior and thereby leading to compulsive drug-seeking. To test this hypothesis, we tested cocaine-treated rats in a fear conditioning, inflation, and extinction task, known to depend on medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Cocaine-treated rats conditioned and inflated similar to saline controls but displayed slower extinction learning. These results support the hypothesis that control processes in the medial prefrontal cortex are impaired by cocaine exposure. Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive behavior, exem-plified by excessive seeking and <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> {{even in the face of}} adverse consequences. Such behavior has been hypothesized to result from drug-induced neuroadaptations in prefrontal-limbic circuits that normally control behavior (Robinson and Kolb 1999; Vanderschuren and Kalivas 2000; Everitt et al. 2001; Robinson et al. 2001).
