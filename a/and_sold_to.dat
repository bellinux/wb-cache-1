The surplus power produced by domestic microgenerators can, in some jurisdictions, be {{fed into the}} network <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> the utility company, producing a retail credit for the microgenerators' owners to offset their energy costs.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the Swiss Air Force {{acquired}} 20 British Aerospace Hawk Mk.66s {{to provide}} an interim solution to its jet training requirements, but these were retired in 2003 <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> Finland.

5|$|Wettin was {{subsequently}} {{used as a}} training ship for naval cadets; she also acted as a depot ship. The ship was stricken from the naval register on 11 March 1920 <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> ship breakers on 21 November 1921. Wettin was broken up for scrap the following year in Rönnebeck, a part of Bremen. Her bell is {{on display at the}} Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr in Dresden.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Marceau was converted into a floating workshop to support torpedo boats and submarines. She was initially based in Malta, but was later moved to Corfu and then to Bizerte in 1918. She was stricken from the naval register on 1 October 1920, <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> a shipbreaking firm based in Toulon in 1921. While she was being towed to Toulon, a storm caused her to run aground off Bizerte. She remained visible there until the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Another bust of {{particular}} value is the marble portrait of Armand Gaston, sculpted in 1730–1731 in Rome by Edmé Bouchardon. It is also {{displayed in the}} library. The floor of the chapel is partly covered with a 1745 imitation of a Turkish carpet, woven in the Aubusson manufactory and bearing in its centre the coat of arms of Armand Gaston deRohan. The carpet covering the large table {{in the middle of}} the library was woven in Portuguese India around 1730. It was given to the Cathedral chapter after 1806 <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> the Musée de Cluny in 1865 but was returned to the city of Strasbourg on permanent loan in 1939.|$|E
50|$|Details {{about these}} systems are highly classified. Thus, many export {{aircraft}} have downgraded avionics, and buyers often {{replace them with}} domestically developed avionics, sometimes considered superior to the original. Examples are the Sukhoi Su-30MKI <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> India, the F-15I <b>and</b> F-16I <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> Israel, <b>and</b> the F-15K <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> South Korea.|$|R

5|$|As the new battleships were {{intended}} for offensive operations, the Odin class was still retained for coast defense duties. The ships served in this capacity through {{the start of}} World War I, until they were withdrawn from active service in 1915, along with their half-sisters of the Siegfried class. After she was pulled from combat duties, Odin served as a tender in Wilhelmshaven. She was struck from the naval register on 6 December 1919 <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> A. Bernstein Co., a shipping company based in Hamburg. By 1922, the ship had been rebuilt as a freighter, and she served in this capacity until she was scrapped in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Authentic bird's nest soup is {{made from}} the nests of the edible-nest swiftlet (or white-nest swiftlet), Aerodramus fuciphagus, and the black-nest swiftlet, Aerodramus maximus. Instead of {{incorporating}} twigs, feathers and straw like others in the genus, these two swiftlets make their nest only from strands of their gummy saliva, which harden when exposed to air. Once the nests are harvested, they are cleaned <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> restaurants. Over the past twenty years, the high demand for the nests of these Aerodramus species has had an adverse effect on their populations. The Niah caves population of black-nest swiftlets plunged from around 1.5 million pairs in 1959 to 150,000–298,000 pairs in the early 1990s through over-harvesting.|$|E
5|$|Bhagyalakshmi, a young woman, has a car {{accident}} while returning from a party and is hospitalised with severe head injuries. When she recovers, she is diagnosed with retrograde amnesia and she fails to recognise her own parents. She mentally regresses {{to the state of}} a child. While she is undergoing treatment, she is kidnapped <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> the madam of a brothel. Srinivas, also known as Cheenu, comes to Chennai to meet his old friend. Together, they visit the brothel to relax. The madam sends Bhagyalakshmi, renamed Vijaya, to his room. Cheenu realises that she is mentally still a child and pities her. He learns that she is from a cultured family, and that she was kidnapped and forced into prostitution.|$|E

5|$|Buildings {{lost during}} the 20th century include schools and several chapels serving various Christian denominations. The former St John the Evangelist's Anglican church was {{declared}} redundant <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> Brighton's Greek Orthodox community; meanwhile, a distinctive Modernist church {{was built in}} the 1960s for Spiritualists. A cluster of historic early 19th-century houses and other structures survived the redevelopment, and several were awarded listed status by English Heritage. These buildings and their surroundings were afforded further protection in 2008 when the city council designated the Carlton Hill conservation area.|$|E
5|$|Commercial 'dolphin encounter' {{enterprises}} and tours operate in many countries. The documentary film The Cove documents how dolphins are captured <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> {{some of these}} enterprises (particularly in Asia) while the remaining pod is slaughtered. In addition to such endeavors, the individuals swim with and surface near surfers at the beach. Bottlenose dolphins perform in many aquaria, generating controversy. Animal welfare activists and certain scientists have claimed that the dolphins do not have adequate space or receive adequate care or stimulation. However, others, notably SeaWorld (backed by different scientists), counter that the dolphins are properly cared for, have lots of environmental stimulation and enjoy interacting with humans.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{approved}} {{legislation for}} the coin on March 31, 1936, authorizing 15,000 pieces {{to be struck}} at the three mints then in operation. Melish had hired sculptor Constance Ortmayer to design the coin, but the Commission of Fine Arts refused to recommend the designs. Members objected to the depiction of Stephen Foster on the obverse, finding no connection between Foster, who died in 1864, and the supposed anniversary. Nevertheless, the designs were approved by the Bureau of the Mint, and 5,000 sets from the three mints were issued <b>and</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> Melish's group, the only authorized purchaser.|$|E
