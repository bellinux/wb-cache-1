2500|$|Increasing {{the water}} {{permeability}} of distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct {{cells in the}} kidney, thus allowing water reabsorption and excretion of more concentrated urine, i.e., <b>antidiuresis.</b> This occurs through increased transcription and insertion of water channels (Aquaporin-2) into the apical membrane of distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct epithelial cells. Aquaporins allow water to move down their osmotic gradient {{and out of the}} nephron, increasing the amount of water re-absorbed from the filtrate (forming urine) back into the bloodstream. This effect is mediated by V2 receptors. Vasopressin also increases the concentration of calcium in the collecting duct cells, by episodic release from intracellular stores. [...] Vasopressin, acting through cAMP, also increases transcription of the aquaporin-2 gene, thus increasing the total number of aquaporin-2 molecules in collecting duct cells.|$|E
50|$|This newly {{synthesized}} urea distributes throughout {{total body}} water. Some {{of it is}} recycled through the enterohepatic circulation. Usually, a small amount (less than 0.5 g/day) is lost through the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and skin; during exercise, a substantial fraction may be excreted in sweat. The bulk of the urea, about 10 g each day, is excreted by the kidney {{in a process that}} begins with glomerular filtration. At high urine flow rates (greater than 2 ml/min), 40% of the filtered load is reabsorbed, and at flow rates lower than 2 ml/min, reabsorption may increase to 60%. Low flow, as in urinary tract obstruction, allows more time for reabsorption and is often associated with increases in antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which increases the permeability of the terminal collecting tubule to urea. During ADH-induced <b>antidiuresis,</b> urea secretion contributes to the intratubular concentration of urea. The subsequent buildup of urea in the inner medulla is critical to the process of urinary concentration. Reabsorption is also increased by volume contraction, reduced renal plasma flow as in congestive heart failure, and decreased glomerular filtration.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{syndrome}} {{of inappropriate}} <b>antidiuresis</b> {{is the most}} common cause of euvolemic hypo-osmolality. This syndrome is associated with a wide variety of diseases. However, its most frequent causes are related to malignancies, especially lung cancer. In this case report, we describe an unknown association of the syndrome of inappropriate <b>antidiuresis</b> with papillary thyroid cancer. Case presentation We present the case of a 71 -year-old Caucasian, German woman with marked hyponatremia and neurological symptoms. After a detailed clinical investigation, the common causes of syndrome of inappropriate <b>antidiuresis</b> and other malignancies were ruled out. A thyroid nodule was detected by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Although fine needle aspiration cytology showed negative results, our patient underwent surgery. Papillary thyroid cancer was later diagnosed. After total thyroidectomy, a complete remission of the clinical symptoms occurred and our patient subsequently had iodine- 131 radioactive therapy. Hyponatremia was no longer observed during the follow-up investigations. Conclusion This is the first reported case of paraneoplastic syndrome of inappropriate <b>antidiuresis</b> caused by papillary thyroid carcinoma. Since its symptoms occurred before the development of local symptoms, total thyroidectomy may provide a timely and efficient treatment for the underlying malignancy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Increased urinary {{excretion}} of PGE 2 during inappropriate antidiureses {{induced by}} DDAVP. Increased urinary prostaglandin E excretion (UPGE 2 V) and renal production of PGE 2 have {{been implicated in}} the mediation of escape from inappropriate <b>antidiuresis</b> induced by vasopressin (AVP). AVP-induced increases in PGE 2 {{have been linked to}} its pressor activity. We examined the effects of the non-pressor AVP analogue, 1,desamino- 8 -D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP), on UPGE 2 V in a rat model of inappropriate <b>antidiuresis</b> in which the escape response is not apparent. A dose of DDAVP known to cause <b>antidiuresis</b> (10 ng/hr), was given by osmotic minipump to rats during a water diuresis established by ad libitum ingestion of 5 % dextrose in water (D/W). This dose of DDAVP reduced plasma sodium (P[Na+]) to 127 ± 2 mEq/liter within 24 hr. P[Na+] in controls given 5 % D/W alone was 151 ± 2. In the first eight hr after DDAVP, UPGE 2 V was fivefold higher than in control animals, an increase which was sustained for 48 hrs. Plasma renin (PRA) was threefold higher in control rats compared to rats that had received DDAVP, consistent with volume expansion in the latter. Despite declines in P[Na+] and PRA and increased UPGE 2 V in DDAVP treated rats, evidence of escape from inappropriate <b>antidiuresis</b> (secondary decline in Uosm or rise in urine volume (V) or P[Na+]) was lacking. Moreover, DDAVP induced similar fivefold increases in UPGE 2 V when given to fluid deprived rats, demonstrating that increases of UPGE 2 V during inappropriate <b>antidiuresis</b> were not mediated by volume expansion. Administration of indomethacin to volume repleted DDAVP treated rats did not significantly increase Uosmol or decrease V compared to values observed in rats receiving DDAVP alone. The results indicate that an increase in UPGE 2 V per se is not sufficient to trigger escape from inappropriate <b>antidiuresis.</b> They also suggest that increased UPGE 2 V can be mediated directly through the antidiuretic as well as the pressor activity of AVP...|$|E

In contrast, there was a nearly 50 % reduction of non-specific phosphomonoesterase activity, using p-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate and membrane subfractions prepared from the <b>antidiuresis</b> animals.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect of selective muscarinic antagonists on natriuresis, kaliuresis and <b>antidiuresis</b> induced by intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) injection of carbachol in the rat. The muscarinic antagonists were given by i. c. v. injection 1 min before carbachol (1 microgram/rat). 4 -Diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine methiodide (4 -DAMP), a rather selective M 1 and M 3 receptor antagonist, was the most potent inhibitor of carbachol-induced natriuresis, kaliuresis and <b>antidiuresis,</b> its ID 50 being respectively 0. 12, 0. 04 and 0. 56 nmol/rat. Pirenzepine, a selective M 1 antagonist, potently inhibited the above mentioned carbachol effects, its ID 50 being 1. 85, 3. 25 and 1. 49 nmol/rat, respectively. On the other hand, the M 2 -selective antagonist methoctramine and the M 3 -selective antagonist p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol were very weak inhibitors. Methoctramine at doses up to 60 nmol/rat produced non statistically significant inhibition of carbachol-induced natriuresis, kaliuresis and <b>antidiuresis.</b> Para-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-diphenidol showed an ID 50 of 64. 4 nmol/rat on carbachol-induced natriuresis, while at the maximum dose employed, 100 nmol/rat, the inhibition of carbachol-induced kaliuresis and <b>antidiuresis</b> was lower than 50 %. The rank order of potency of the antagonists tested proved {{to be related to}} their pA 2 values for muscarinic M 1 receptors, suggesting that this receptor subtype mediates the central effects of cholinergic mechanisms on water and electrolyte excretion...|$|E
40|$|The rate of {{cutaneous}} {{water uptake}} after dehydration was significantly depressed in functionally neurohypophysectomized toads (Bufo marinas), which consequently regained weight {{much more slowly}} than intact toads when returned to water. Toads bearing hypothalamic lesions were able to develop an <b>antidiuresis</b> when removed from water to a saturated atmosphere, but the <b>antidiuresis</b> was solely glomerular in origin and was established more slowly than in intact animals. The fractional reabsorption of filtrate increased significantly and the relative free water clearance decreased significantly in intact toads after removal from water. These changes in tubular function, which were not seen in lesioned toads, {{were responsible for the}} development of a more rapid and effective <b>antidiuresis</b> in intact animals. Injections of iso-osmotic saline, oxytocin (250 mu. / 100 g) and vasopressin (50 mu. / 100 g) had no significant effect on rates of cutaneous water uptake in both intact and lesioned toads. Injections of hyperosmotic saline, however, significantly increased rates of water uptake in both groups of toads, but to a much greater extent in the intact animals. Fluid retention arising from a marked <b>antidiuresis</b> occurred after the injection of vasopressin and hyperosmo-tic saline, and there was some evidence of an antidiuretic effect of oxytocin with the doses used here. These results and their bearing on the question of the functional significance of the neurohypophysis in anuran amphibians are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Normal {{subjects}} and patients with antidiuretic hormone (ADH) deficiency were studied {{to determine the}} mechanism of the antidiuretic action of clofibrate. Before clofibrate treatment, the patients' ability to concentrate urine with a standardized dehydration procedure correlated {{with the amount of}} ADH which was excreted. During clofibrate administration all six patients with ADH deficiency developed an <b>antidiuresis</b> which was like that of ADH, since there was no change in sodium, potassium, total solute, or creatinine excretion. There was a correlation between the patients' ability to concentrate urine during dehydration and the subsequent response to clofibrate, and the excretion of ADH during dehydration correlated with the excretion of ADH on clofibrate therapy. Clofibrate-induced <b>antidiuresis</b> in these patients was partially overcome by ethanol and by water loading. Clofibrate interfered with the ability of patients and subjects to excrete a water load and prevented the water load from inhibiting ADH excretion in the normal subjects. These studies suggested that clofibrate was acting through endogenous ADH and this thesis was supported by the failure of clofibrate to produce an <b>antidiuresis</b> when injected into rats with total ADH deficiency (Brattleboro strain) although an <b>antidiuresis</b> was produced in water-loaded normal rats. When the drug was injected into Brattleboro rats with exogenous ADH, clofibrate either did not alter or it inhibited the action of the ADH. The data demonstrate that clofibrate has a significant ADH-like action. This action appears to be mediated through the release of endogenous ADH...|$|E
40|$|To reduce lithium-induced nephrogenic {{diabetes}} insipidus (lithium-NDI), patients with bipolar disorder {{are treated with}} thiazide and amiloride, which are thought to induce <b>antidiuresis</b> by a compensatory increase in prourine uptake in proximal tubules. However, thiazides induced <b>antidiuresis</b> and alkalinized the urine in lithium-NDI mice lacking the sodium-chloride cotransporter, suggesting that inhibition of carbonic anhydrases (CAs) confers the beneficial thiazide effect. Therefore, we tested {{the effect of the}} CA-specific blocker acetazolamide in lithium-NDI. In collecting duct (mpkCCD) cells, acetazolamide reduced the cellular lithium content and attenuated lithium-induced downregulation of aquaporin- 2 through a mechanism different from that of amiloride. Treatment of lithium-NDI mice with acetazolamide or thiazide/amiloride induced similar <b>antidiuresis</b> and increased urine osmolality and aquaporin- 2 abundance. Thiazide/amiloride-treated mice showed hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, metabolic acidosis, and increased serum lithium concentrations, adverse effects previously observed in patients but not in acetazolamide-treated mice in this study. Furthermore, acetazolamide treatment reduced inulin clearance and cortical expression of sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 and attenuated the increased expression of urinary PGE 2 observed in lithium-NDI mice. These results show that the <b>antidiuresis</b> with acetazolamide was partially caused by a tubular-glomerular feedback response and reduced GFR. The tubular-glomerular feedback response and/or direct effect on collecting duct principal or intercalated cells may underlie the reduced urinary PGE 2 levels with acetazolamide, thereby contributing to the attenuation of lithium-NDI. In conclusion, CA activity contributes to lithium-NDI development, and acetazolamide attenuates lithium-NDI development in mice similar to thiazide/amiloride but with fewer adverse effects...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{lowering}} {{the pressure of}} oxygen from 80 to 34 mm Hg was examined in anesthetized dogs that were undergoing a water diuresis. This degree of hypoxia was associated with an <b>antidiuresis</b> as urine osmolality (Uosm) increased from 107 to 316 mosmol/kg H 2 O (P < 0. 001) and plasma arginine vasopressin increased from 0. 06 to 7. 5 μU/ml, (P < 0. 05). However, hypoxia {{was not associated with}} significant changes in cardiac output (CO, from 4. 2 to 4. 7 liters/ min), mean arterial pressure (MAP, from 143 to 149 mm Hg), glomerular filtration rate (GFR, from 46 to 42 ml/min), solute excretion rate (SV, from 302 to 297 mosmol/min), or filtration fraction (from 0. 26 to 0. 27, NS). Hypoxia was associated with an increase in renal vascular resistance (from 0. 49 to 0. 58 mm Hg/ml per min, P < 0. 01). The magnitude of hypoxia-induced <b>antidiuresis</b> was the same in innervated kidneys and denervated kidneys. To further examine the role of vasopressin in this <b>antidiuresis,</b> hypoxia was induced in hypophysectomized animals. The effect of hypoxia on CO, MAP, GFR, SV, and renal blood flow in hypophysectomized animals was the same as in intact animals. In contrast to intact animals, however, hypoxia did not induce a significant <b>antidiuresis</b> in hypophysectomized animals (Uosm from 72 to 82 mosmol/kg H 2 O). To delineate the afferent pathway for hypoxia-stimulated vasopressin release, hypoxia was induced in dogs with either chemo- or baroreceptor denervation. The effect of hypoxia on CO, MAP, GFR, SV, and renal blood flow in the denervated animals was the same as in nondenervated animals. Hypoxia resulted in an <b>antidiuresis</b> in chemoreceptor (Uosm from 113 to 357 mosmol/kg H 2 O, P < 0. 001) but not in baroreceptor (Uosm from 116 to 138 mosmol/kg H 2 O, NS) denervated animals. To determine if hypoxia alters renal response to vasopressin, exogenous vasopressin was administered to normoxic and hypoxic groups of dogs. The antidiuretic effect of vasopressin was no different in these two groups. These results demonstrate that hypoxia induces an <b>antidiuresis</b> which is independent of alterations in CO, MAP, SV, filtration fraction, renal nerves, or renal response to vasopressin and occurs through baroreceptor-mediated vasopressin release.

40|$|The {{syndrome}} {{of inappropriate}} antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), {{also referred to}} as syndrome of inappropriate <b>antidiuresis</b> (SIAD), is {{the most common cause of}} hyponatremia characterized by extracellular hypotonicity and impaired urine dilution in the absence of any recognizable nonosmotic stimuli for the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). Hyponatremia in SIADH is primarily the result of excessive water retention caused by a combination of inappropriate <b>antidiuresis</b> and persistent fluid intake in the presence of impaired osmoregulated inhibition of thirst. It is sometimes aggravated by a sodium deficiency caused by a decreased intake or a secondary natriuresis in response to elevated extracellular volume. Inappropriate <b>antidiuresis</b> usually results from endogenous production of AVP that can be either ectopic (from a malignancy) or eutopic (from the hypothalamus/neurohypophysis). Regardless of its origin, different types of osmotic dysregulation of AVP have been reported with possibly fundamental deviations in treatment need and efficacy. A recent quantitative analysis of 50 patients with SIADH, which underwent serial measurements of copeptin during hypertonic saline infusion, revealed five distinct types of osmoregulatory defect ("type A to E") without affiliation to specific underlying diseases. In addition to apparently impaired osmoregulated inhibition of AVP release in the majority of patients, 12 % of patients showed an AVP-independent mechanism of inappropriate <b>antidiuresis,</b> whilst 20 % of them presented a reverse relation between hormone release and serum osmolality, presumably related to interrupted nonosmotic inhibitory pathways.

40|$|Vasopressin-related {{alterations}} {{of sodium}} reabsorption by the loop of Henle. Recollection micropuncture experiments were performed in dogs to determine distal tubular fluid sodium concentration, osmolality and water reabsorption during three states of hydration: 1) spontaneous <b>antidiuresis,</b> 2) water diuresis and ECF volume expansion, and 3) vasopressin-induced <b>antidiuresis</b> during sustained ECF volume expansion. Distal TF/PNa and TF/POsm ratios decreased in parallel during water diuresis. During vasopressin infusion and an established hypertonic urine, TF/PNa and TF/POsm returned to values observed during spontaneous <b>antidiuresis.</b> These parallel and reversible changes in distal sodium concentration were {{not associated with}} appropriate changes in water reabsorption, {{as indicated by the}} constancy of recollection TF/P inulin ratios, by either the proximal nephron alone or by the entire nephron to the distal site of collection. The results suggest that the water diuresis-associated reduction in distal sodium concentration is due to increased net sodium reabsorption in the loop of Henle; vasopressin abolishes this increase in sodium reabsorption in both normovolemic and expanded dogs. Alterations in medullary blood flow, induced directly or indirectly by vasopressin, may explain the observed changes in distal tubule sodium concentration...|$|E

Here, we describe a 3 -month-old hyponatremic infant {{found to have a}} phenylalanine 229 to valine (F 229 V) substitution in V 2 R. Characterization of this substitution in vitro revealed that it leads to high constitutive activity of the receptor, compatible with spontaneous <b>antidiuresis.</b> In contrast to R 137 C/L mutant receptors, F 229 V receptors do not undergo spontaneous desensitization, which results in sustained, high basal activity. Notably, the V 2 R-selective inverse agonists tolvaptan and satavaptan completely silenced the constitutive signaling activity of the F 229 V mutant receptor, indicating that this substitution does not lock the receptor in an irreversible active state. Thus, inverse agonists might prove to be effective therapies for treating patients with this or other spontaneously activating mutations that do not lock the V 2 R in its active state.

The tip of the left renal papilla was exposed and fluid was obtained by micropuncture from loops of Henle and from collecting ducts at the papillary tip, and {{at an average of}} 1 mm proximal to the tip. In water diuresis the ratio of tubule fluid to plasma (TF/P) osmolality (osm) of loop fluid was 1. 73 ± 0. 058 (SE); of fluid from the proximal collecting duct, 0. 63 ± 0. 027; and from the tip, 0. 55 ± 0. 024; indicating a substantial osmotic pressure difference across the collecting duct epithelium. The fraction of filtered water reabsorbed (× 100) by the terminal collecting duct was 1. 58 % ± 0. 32. In <b>antidiuresis</b> the TF/P osm of loop fluid was 2. 65 ± 0. 109; of fluid from the proximal collecting duct, 2. 20 ± 0. 093; and from the tip, 2. 71 ± 0. 111; indicating a marked decrease in the driving force for water reabsorption.

These include: (a) stimulation of renin synthesis in the cortex: (b) <b>antidiuresis</b> by beta adrenergic agents; and (c) diuresis by alpha adrenergic stimulation. The role of cyclic 3 ′, 5 ′-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in the renal actions of catecholamines was evaluated by measuring the effects of several adrenergic agents on cyclic AMP concentration in the dog kidney...|$|E
40|$|AIM: During <b>antidiuresis,</b> {{vasopressin}} release {{causes the}} translocation {{of the water}} channel aquaporin 2 (AQP 2) from cytoplasmic storage vesicles to the apical plasma membrane of the collecting duct principal cells, leading to urine concentration. In the inheritable disorder nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), patients are unable to concentrate their urine in response to vasopressin. Mutations of the vasopressin receptor II (V 2 R) gene have shown to be causative for 90...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the <b>antidiuresis</b> associated with intravenous (i. v.) infusion of the beta adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (ISO), is mediated by release of endogenous vasopressin. To examine whether beta-adrenergic stimulation causes vasopressin release by a direct cerebral action, ISO was infused into the carotid artery in a dose estimated to equal the amount of catecholamine reaching the cerebral circulation in the i. v. studies. This intracarotid infusion did not alter renal or systemic hemodynamics, urinary osmolality (Uosm) or free-water clearance (CH 2 O). Although renal perfusion pressure was maintained constant in all experiments i. v. ISO was consistently associated with a decrease in total peripheral resistance and systemic arterial pressure as cardiac output increased. To investigate whether the decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure with i. v. ISO might be responsible for vasopressin release, the carotid arteries were bilaterally constricted both above and below the carotid sinus to lower carotid perfusion pressure by a mean of 25 mmHg, a decrement comparable to that observed during i. v. ISO. Constriction of the carotid arteries above the carotid sinus did not affect Uosm or CH 2 O, while constriction below the sinus was associated with an <b>antidiuresis</b> as Uosm increased from 155 ± 25 to 385 ± 58 mosmol/kg (P < 0. 001) and CH 2 O decreased from 1. 20 to − 0. 44 ml/min (P < 0. 001). This <b>antidiuresis</b> was not significantly different from that observed during i. v. ISO. Since these results suggested that changes in autonomic neural tone from arterial baroreceptors are responsible for vasopressin release with i. v. ISO, studies were performed in animals with denervated baroreceptors. While sham-operated animals and animals with bilateral cervical vagotomy showed a reversible <b>antidiuresis</b> with i. v. ISO infusion, dogs with complete denervation of arterial baroreceptors did not show a significant alteration in renal water excretion (Uosm, 187 to 182 mosmol/kg and CH 2 O, 0. 59 to 0. 74 ml/min). The results therefore indicate that ISO stimulates vasopressin release by altering baroreceptor tone rather than by a direct central or depressor effect of the catecholamine. These same baroreceptor pathways have been recently shown {{to be involved in the}} suppression of vasopressin release with norepinephrine and may well be the common pathway whereby nonosmotic stimuli control vasopressin release...|$|E

Although asymptomatic, the biochemical abnormality improved after discontinuation of carbamazepine. Hyponatraemia developed after rechallenge with controlled release carbamazepine.

40|$|Analysis of {{nocturia}} questionnaires {{mailed to}} all persons aged 65 {{years or more}} in Tierp, a Swedish rural community, showed {{that the number of}} nocturnal voids was highly correlated with urge and incontinence. No correlation between nocturia and a known and treated hypertension, angina, congestive heart failure or diabetes mellitus was detected. Frequency-volume charts from elderly subjects with two or more voids per night (nocturics) were compared with those reporting < 1 void/night (non-nocturics). Nocturics had a higher nocturnal urine production and lower volume per void than non-nocturics. The differences between nocturics and non-nocturics in urine production and largest voided volume did not follow the same pattern in men and women. Considerable overlap was found in all studied voiding parameters and nocturia was mainly due to a mismatch between nocturnal urine volume and largest voided volume rather than abnormal values in either. The results also indicated that, from a community-perspective, nocturnal polyuria was the dominant pathogenic factor. Elderly patients with nocturia were treated with 0. 2 mg peroral desmopressin for three consecutive nights. The short-term treatment was well tolerated and the absolute majority of patients did not experience any serum sodium value below the normal range. Logistic regression searching for risk factors for hyponatraemia showed increased risk with increasing age, concomitant cardiac disease and increasing 24 -hour urine output. A database study including over 600 patients exposed to desmopressin verified that increasing age and 24 -hour urine output increase the risk of hyponatraemia. Desmopressin-induced hyponatraemia follows the model of SIADH. Re-challenge of 5 women who developed hyponatraemia showed recurrence of hyponatraemia on the same dose regimen. Hyponatraemia was due to failure to decrease fluid intake in proportion to the reduction in diuresis and <b>antidiuresis</b> lasting 24 -hours or more. The findings suggest that the prolonged <b>antidiuresis</b> was secondary to slow elimination of desmopressin rather than to an endogenous source of <b>antidiuresis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Recent {{results from}} our {{laboratories}} indicate that renal escape from vasopressin (AVP) -induced <b>antidiuresis</b> {{is accompanied by}} marked down-regulation of kidney aquaporin- 2 (AQP 2) and AVP V 2 receptors. The present studies evaluated the effect of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins (PG) synthesis blockade on escape from <b>antidiuresis.</b> DDAVP-infused rats were water loaded (WL) for 5 days. L-NAME, an NO synthesis inhibitor, or diclofenac, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, was infused subcutaneously beginning one day before WL. As early as 2 days after WL, urine volume increased and urine osmolality decreased, indicating the onset of escape. Endogenous NO synthesis, measured as urinary NO 2 + NO 3 excretion, was significantly increased in the WL group compared to the non-WL controls during all 5 days of WL. L-NAME (20 mg/kg/day) markedly decreased urine volume on days 4 and 5 of WL, indicating inhibition of the escape phenomenon. Kidney AQP 2 protein was significantly increased by this dose of L-NAME as well. A lower dose of L-NAME (10 mg/kg/day) or diclofenac (2. 5 mg/kg/day) did not significantly affect the escape phenomenon by themselves, but the combination o...|$|E
