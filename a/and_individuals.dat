40|$|Group {{psychotherapy}} in Germany is {{well established}} {{as part of an}} integrative treatment plan in inpatient treatment. Outpatient group psychotherapy, however, is conceptualized as a separate treatment option in competition with individual therapy. German guidelines for outpatient psychotherapy exclude concurrant group <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> therapy. Research favors studies on treatments in pure form. So publications on concurrant group <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> psychotherapy are mainly descriptive and published in english. This paper describes models of simultaneous group <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> psychotherapy with special reference to inpatient treatment and to the psychoanalytic-interactional group psychotherapy (a treatment modality within the Goettingen modell of group psychotherapy). Outpatient treatment with concurrant group <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> therapy at the Goettingen University Student Counselling Center is described. Discussion covers pre-treatment preparation of patients, different group settings, therapists' difficulties with concurrant treatment and indications for combinations of group <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> therapy. Evidence reported suggests for outpatient treatment the use of group psychotherapy not only as an alternative to individual therapy but also as concurrant therapy with groups <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> sessions as parts of an integrative treatment plan. Concurrant group <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> therapy offers some advantages of inpatient treatment in an outpatient setting...|$|R
