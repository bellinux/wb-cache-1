5|$|Through the Middle Ages Etymologiae was the {{textbook}} most in use, regarded so highly as <b>a</b> <b>repository</b> <b>of</b> classical learning that, {{in a great}} measure, it superseded {{the use of the}} individual works of the classics themselves, full texts of which were no longer copied and thus were lost. It {{was one of the most}} popular compendia in medieval libraries.|$|E

In addition to the official components of the OS included in the ISOs, Bell Labs also hosts <b>a</b> <b>repository</b> <b>of</b> externally developed applications and tools.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> {{knowledge}} <b>repository</b> {{can take}} many forms to [...] "contain" [...] the knowledge it holds. A customer database is <b>a</b> knowledge <b>repository</b> <b>of</b> customer information and insights - or electronic explicit knowledge. A Library is <b>a</b> knowledge <b>repository</b> <b>of</b> books - physical explicit knowledge. A community of experts is <b>a</b> knowledge <b>repository</b> <b>of</b> tacit knowledge or experience. The nature <b>of</b> the <b>repository</b> only changes to contain/manage the type of knowledge it holds. <b>A</b> <b>repository</b> (as opposed to an archive) is designed to get knowledge out. It should therefore have some rules of structure, classification, taxonomy, record management, etc., to facilitate user engagement.|$|R

5|$|The Canberra Museum and Gallery in {{the city}} is <b>a</b> <b>repository</b> <b>of</b> local history and art, housing a {{permanent}} collection and visiting exhibitions. Several historic homes {{are open to the}} public: Lanyon and Tuggeranong Homesteads in the Tuggeranong Valley, Mugga-Mugga in Symonston, and Blundells' Cottage in Parkes all display the lifestyle of the early European settlers. Calthorpes' House in Red Hill is a well-preserved example of a 1920s house from Canberra's very early days.|$|E
5|$|In 287 BC, the plebeians again seceded. To end the secession, the lex Hortensia was passed, which {{required}} that plebiscites, laws {{passed by the}} Plebeian Council, be binding on the whole Roman people. The Hortensian law resolved the last great political question of the earlier era; the electoral and legislative sovereignty of the assemblies was confirmed and would remain part of the constitution until {{the demise of the}} Republic. As a whole, the outcome of the political struggles of the early republic was to eliminate the privileged status of patricians in the constitution and grant the plebs recognition of their own officers. The institution of the Senate was also now arguably stronger, as it became <b>a</b> <b>repository</b> <b>of</b> former magistrates rather than a body of hereditary nobles.|$|E

5|$|The {{sculpture}} department comprises work created before 1850 {{that does}} not belong in the Etruscan, Greek, and Roman department. The Louvre has been <b>a</b> <b>repository</b> <b>of</b> sculpted material since its time as a palace; however, only ancient architecture was displayed until 1824, except for Michelangelo's Dying Slave and Rebellious Slave. Initially the collection included only 100pieces, {{the rest of the}} royal sculpture collection being at Versailles. It remained small until 1847, when Léon Laborde was given control of the department. Laborde developed the medieval section and purchased the first such statues and sculptures in the collection, King Childebert and stanga door, respectively. The collection was part of the Department of Antiquities but was given autonomy in 1871 under Louis Courajod, a director who organized a wider representation of French works. In 1986, all post-1850 works were relocated to the new Musée d'Orsay. The Grand Louvre project separated the department into two exhibition spaces; the French collection is displayed in the Richelieu wing, and foreign works in the Denon wing.|$|E

25|$|In {{attempting}} to construct such an umbrella theory, Rivers accepted that the unconscious exists {{and that the}} contents of the unconscious are entirely inaccessible to a person except through the processes of hypnosis, dreaming, or psychoanalysis.
