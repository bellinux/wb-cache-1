25|$|Whatever is good, bad or {{indifferent}} about Streets of Fire, {{it had a}} {{huge impact}} on other filmmakers. The two movies that came out in the years after that are completely saturated in the iconography of Streets of Fire are RoboCop and Se7en. Se7en’s taking place in another world. It’s not New York. It’s not Chicago. A world where it’s raining all the time. Always dark. Always night, just about. Those are two very successful movies that figured out how to do the stylization with the appropriate amount of gore that they hooked the audience. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we’d done more gore, our chances of hooking the audience would be greater.|$|E

"Marriage {{should be}} {{a man and a}} woman...I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the {{domestic}} partnership legislation in NY has worked very, very well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> a good way to deal with it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would be a good model for other states to have.

"Come, Brother," [...] {{said the}} Prince, [...] "this lady is weary of us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{she were a}} true woman she would answer our {{questions}} more readily.

"With submission, sir," [...] said he, [...] "yesterday I was {{thinking}} about Bartleby here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he would but prefer to take a quart of good ale every day, it would do much towards mending him, and enabling him to assist in examining his papers." ...|$|E

5000|$|Farrell, {{who is a}} Christian, {{believes}} that marriage is {{between a man and}} a woman but has said [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have the right or anybody has a right to tell somebody who they can or can't love. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this is a civil rights issue. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the right thing to do is let the voters decide." ...|$|R
2500|$|Being {{a period}} of that era of the 1950's <b>I</b> <b>think</b> being gay must have been pretty harsh for Graham. I can imagine...everybody knew, nobody cared, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it was such a}} time when you didn't talk about issues <b>that</b> were personal, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> made him much more secretive <b>and</b> reclusive, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was {{probably}} quite a tough thing for him... — Susan Gaye Anderson ...|$|R

[...] "I am not {{speaking}} of the rich alone, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you knew Boston you would not say that the conservative class there is wholly composed of wealthy people. Many of may father's friends {{were by no means}} wealthy. And I know that if he had been poor he would have held the same views." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To-morrow or next day," [...] {{her father}} said. [...] "Mynheer Van Voorden says, 'I {{am about to}} start,' which may mean three days or six. It will need a whole day for your mother and the maids to see to Albert's clothes, and that all is decent and in order. To-day is Monday, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we say that Albert will arrive there on Thursday by noon it will do very well. Will you be ready by that time, Edgar?" ...|$|E

But I did write as I say, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> she had got my letter before she had written herself, she would perhaps have stayed.

6000|$|Notwithstanding that I {{was amused}} at his mistake, the label he had {{supplied}} me with {{was something to}} be grateful for, and I am now finding a use for it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he, my labeller, should see this sketch by chance and recognise himself in it, he will say with his pleasant smile and wave of the hand, [...] "Oh, that's his line! Yes, yes, I described him rightly enough, thinking it haberdashery or floral texts for cottage bedrooms, or something of that kind; I didn't imagine he was a traveller in anything quite so small as this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have at {{all events}} taken your share in using good {{practical}} precautions for the town, {{and that is}} the best mode of asking for protection," [...] said Lydgate, with a strong distaste for the broken metaphor and bad logic of the banker's religion, somewhat increased by the apparent deafness of his sympathy. But his mind had taken up its long-prepared movement towards getting help, and was not yet arrested. He added, [...] "The town has done well in the way of cleansing, and finding appliances; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the cholera should come, even our enemies will admit that the arrangements in the Hospital are a public good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{could do}} nothing but go home; the whole county {{seemed to be in}} a ferment. At Loughrea we went away in our own directions, and poor Tom with Barney Smith rode home to Ahaseragh. But not a word did he speak to anyone, even to Barney; nor did Barney dare to speak a word to him. He trotted all the way to Ahaseragh in moody silence, {{thinking}} of the terrible ill that had been done him. I have known Tom for twenty years, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he loves any man he loves me. But he parted from me that day without a word." ...|$|E

Self-made persons are usually precise in their language; they rarely violate the written laws of society. Besides, his pronunciation of some words is so distinct that an idea crossed me once that he might be an actor. But then it is not uniformly distinct. I am sure that he has some object or occupation in life: he has not the air of an idler. Yet I have thought of all the ordinary professions, and he does not fit one of them. This is perhaps what makes him interesting. He is unaccountable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} {{as likely to}} be the other way," [...] Captain Davenant said. [...] "Walter is a good lad, and a brave one, but, with all Claire's pretty winning ways, I {{question}} if the young lady has not more will of her own, and more mind, than Walter has. I hope they may agree each to go their own way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> they continue to live in this country, they will probably do so, for here, unhappily, political differences build up a wall between the two branches of Christianity. But, if it should come that they should some day leave this unhappy country, and settle in England, where the same ill feeling does not exist, there is no saying what may happen." ...|$|E
60|$|Really, {{the drama}} had grown very impressive; {{it was a}} mystery, to say the least; and so it must remain forever, for when Frank, {{infected}} at last by Mrs. Sallie's faith in tragedy, {{opened the door and}} offered his tardy services, the wagon was driven rapidly away without reply. They never learned what it had all been; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> one actually honors mysteries, it is best not to look into them. How much finer, after all, if you have such a thing as this happen before your door at midnight, not to throw any light upon it! Then your probable tipsy man cannot be proved other than a tragical presence, which you can match with any inscrutable creation of fiction; and if you should ever come to write a romance, as one is very liable to do in this age, there is your unknown, a figure of strange and fearful interest, made to your hand, and capable of being used, in or out of the body, with a very gloomy effect.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was a very}} trying {{moment for}} us all, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we had, any of us, had our choice, we should have {{preferred}} {{to be in her}} place rather than our own. We miserably did what we could to comfort her, and we at last silenced her with I do not know what pretences. The affair was quite too much for me, and I made a feint of having heard the children calling me, and I went out into the hall. I felt that there was a sort of indecency in my witnessing that poor young thing's emotion; women might see it, but a man ought not. Perhaps old Hasketh felt the same; he followed me out, and when we were beyond hearing, even if he had spoken aloud, he dropped his voice to a thick murmur and said, [...] "This has all been a mistake. We have {{had to get out of}} it with the girl the best we could; and we don't dare to let her know that Tedham isn't coming back any more. You noticed from what she said that my wife tried to make believe it might be well if he didn't; but she had to drop that; it set the girl wild. She hasn't got anything but the one idea: that she and her father belong to each other, and that they must be together for the rest of their lives. A curious thing about it is," [...] and Hasketh sank his voice still lower to say this, [...] "that she thinks that if he's taken the punishment that was put upon him he has atoned for what he did; and if any one tries to make him suffer more he does worse than Tedham did, and he's flying in the face of Providence. Perhaps it's so. I'm afraid," [...] Hasketh continued, with the satisfaction men take in blaming their wives under the cover of sympathy, [...] "that Mrs. Hasketh is going to feel it more and more, as time goes on, unless Tedham turns up. I was never in favor of trying to have the child forget him, or be separated from him in any way. That kind of thing can't be made to work, and I don't suppose, when you come to boil it down, that it's essentially right. This universe, I take it, isn't an accident in any particular, and if she's his daughter it's because she was meant to be, and to bear and share with him. You see it was a great mistake not to prepare the child for it sooner, and tell her just when Tedham would be out, so that if she wanted to see him she could. She thinks she ought to have been there at the prison waiting to speak to him the first one. I thought it was a mistake to have her away, and I guess that's the way Mrs. Hasketh looks at it herself, now." ...|$|E

5000|$|I'm writing but I'm {{writing at}} a much slower pace than {{previously}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I {{come up with something}} really, really good, I would be perfectly willing to publish it because that still feels like the final act of the creative process, publishing it so people can read it and you can get feedback and people can talk about it {{with each other and with}} you, the writer, but the force of my invention has slowed down a lot over the years and that's as it should be.|$|E
