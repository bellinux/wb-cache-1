Particular {{attention was paid to}} the relation- ship between the crystallographic orientation of individual grains and grain patches that exhibit slip band formation, fatigue crack initiation and growth. Therefore, electrolytically polished bulk specimens have been fatigued under fully reversed loading in an ultrasonic fatigue testing machine while the surface has been observed in-situ by an optical microscope. The specimens were carefully analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in combination with automated electron back-scatter dif- fraction (EBSD). In case of the <b>austenitic-ferritic</b> duplex steel under VHCF loading conditions, slip band formation is limited to the softer austenite grains. Once being formed, the bands generate high stress concentrations where they impinge the austenite- ferrite (γ−α) phase boundaries, eventually, leading to the crack initiation. In case of the tempering steel crack initiation is caused by slip band formation within the martensitic laths structure.
