5|$|The temple is a {{powerful}} symbol of Cambodia, and is <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> national pride that has factored into Cambodia's diplomatic relations with France, the United States and its neighbour Thailand. A depiction of Angkor Wat {{has been a part}} of Cambodian national flags since the introduction of the first version circa 1863. From a larger historical and even transcultural perspective, however, the temple of Angkor Wat did not become a symbol of national pride sui generis but had been inscribed into a larger politico-cultural process of French-colonial heritage production in which the original temple site was presented in French colonial and universal exhibitions in Paris and Marseille between 1889 and 1937. Angkor Wat's aesthetics were also on display in the plaster cast museum of Louis Delaporte called musée Indo-chinois which existed in the Parisian Trocadero Palace from c.1880 to the mid-1920s.|$|E

2500|$|Ransom or sale of {{captured}} prisoners (and {{auction of}} cargo) {{was the main}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> private wealth in Algiers. Payment for captives was financed and negotiated by religious societies. The conditions of the captivity varied, most being worked as slave labor. Yet often the Muslim masters granted these Christians some religious privileges. During the early 17th century in Algiers more than 20,000 Christian prisoners were being held, coming {{from more than a}} dozen countries.

However, for some educated Hmong, Pahawh is considered an embarrassing remnant of a superstitious past (Smalley et al. 1990:165).|$|E
25|$|Factional {{hostilities}} {{emerged as}} soon as American settlers began arriving in southern Arizona in large numbers in the 1860s and 1870s. The Gadsden Purchase of 1853 had opened the territory to Americans, and the sudden growth of settlement and investment proved <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> enmity between local Apaches and the American newcomers. Pima County and later Cochise County were the primary battleground {{for most of the}} resulting quarter-century of warfare, which was almost constant in the region until the late 1880s.|$|E

His death was <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> sorrow for King Leopold, who lost his only heir. The marriage had become unhappy, and the couple separated completely after a last attempt to have another son, a union which resulted in the birth of their last daughter Clementine.

5000|$|In the {{manufacturing}} industry, {{it is commonly}} stated that [...] "Quality drives productivity." [...] Improved productivity is <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>greater</b> revenues, employment opportunities and technological advances. However, {{this has not been}} the case historically, and in the early 19th century it was recognized that some markets, such as those in Asia, preferred cheaper products to those of quality.Most discussions of quality refer to a finished part, wherever it is in the process. Inspection, which is what quality insurance usually means, is historical, since the work is done. The best way to think about quality is in process control. If the process is under control, inspection is not necessary.|$|R

Yet it was <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>greater</b> freedom to her that Will was there; his young equality was agreeable, and also perhaps his openness to conviction. She felt an immense need of some one to speak to, and she had never before seen any one who seemed so quick and pliable, so likely to understand everything.|$|R
25|$|These {{political}} and religious issues were constantly intertwined, and interacted in various ways. Christianity in Britain and Ireland largely progressed through royal patronage, while kings increasingly used the Church to stabilise and to confer legitimacy on their fragile states. A strongly local church with distinctive practices could be <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> support to a fledgling state, allowing the weaving together of {{political and}} religious elites. Conversely, the Roman connection introduced foreign influence {{beyond the control of}} local rulers, but also allowed rulers to display themselves on a wider, European stage, and to seek out more powerful sources of legitimacy.|$|E

The combination of his family's radical heritage, the exciting news from Russia, and the enthusiasm of his radical peers caused Morris Childs to become politically engaged, and he took the step of joining the United Communist Party of America in 1921.|$|E

25|$|Most liberal Muslims {{believe that}} Islam {{promotes}} {{the notion of}} absolute equality of all humanity, {{and that it is}} one of its central concepts. Therefore, a breach of human rights has become <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> concern to most liberal Muslims. Liberal Muslims differ with their culturally conservative counterparts in that they believe that all humanity is represented under the umbrella of human rights. Many Muslim majority countries have signed international human rights treaties, but the impact of these largely remains to be seen in local legal systems – a point highlighted by the fact that most countries which impose conservative interpretations of Shariah law are amongst the most repressive countries in the world, while secular states are often the most open and tolerant.|$|E

Somehow, Scourge was able to temporarily absorb the Matrix's energies, his body mutating into a monstrous, deformed state in the process, and he used his enhanced powers to depose Galvatron as Decepticon commander and lead an attack on Earth, where he was defeated by Hot Rod, who reclaimed the Matrix. Scourge's power play was not without repercussions for him, but after a beating from Galvatron in traditional Decepticon style, he was allowed to remain in their ranks unlike Blitzwing and Octane who were both exiled from the Decepticons.|$|R

25|$|In 1885 a {{programme}} {{of annual}} naval manoeuvres had begun, where the British navy would divide into opposing fleets and conduct war exercises {{as near as}} possible to real conditions which might be experienced. By 1888 this had become <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> interest {{to the public and}} the navy alike. The navy encouraged attention, allowing reporters on board during manoeuvres, believing that the publicity furthered their campaigns for greater funding. That year, the intention was to test the practicality of blockading an enemy fleet in its home ports when the ships concerned were modern iron and steam vessels rather than traditional sailing ships. The idea was that a superior fleet, taking the role of the British, would surprise an inferior enemy force before it could sail from two home ports.|$|E
25|$|During {{its time}} of {{existence}} the legal settlement that gives the rabbinical courts the monopoly on conducting the marriages and divorces of the entire Israeli Jewish population has been <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> criticism from the secular public in Israel, {{but also to the}} ardent support from the religious public. The main argument of the supporters of the law is that its cancellation will divide the Jewish people in Israel between the Jews who would marry and divorce each other within the Jewish religious authorities and the Jews who would marry and divorce each other within the civil marriages—which would not be registered or inspected by the religious authorities, and thus their children would be considered illegitimate to marry the children of the couples married within the religious court, from fear of them being considered Mamzer. Opponents of the law see it as a severe offense to the human civil rights made by the state of Israel.|$|E

40|$|Forward {{integration}} {{has been}} explained {{both as a}} method of achieving monopoly power and as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>greater</b> efficiency [6, 16]. An efficiency perspective underpins the work of Chandler and Williamson who regard vertical integration, particularly into distribution, as a crucial step in the creation and success of large firms. While their views have moved closer, Chandler and Williamson emphasize different motives for forward integration [4, 13]. Technology provides the fundamental dynamic in Chandler's account while Williamson concentrates on responses to the uncertainties of contracts. Four propositions are advanced about motives for integrating manufacturing and distribution. First, Chandler identifies a phase in which new capital-intensive technology and mass production promote large firms in certain industries. Thus, " [...] . the initial step {{in the creation of the}} modern industrial enterprise was the investment in production facilities large enough to achieve the cost advantages of scale and scope " [13, pp. 489 - 90]. The result is a technical imperative to maintain volume in manufacturing by integratin...|$|R

500|$|The exact {{location}} of the Hutchinson house has been <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> interest for several centuries. [...] LaPlante hints in her biography of Hutchinson that the homestead was near the Indian Trail that went through modern-day Pelham Bay Park, {{on the east side}} of the Hutchinson River. Lockwood Barr offers another hypothesis, citing the extensive land title research of Otto Hufeland published by the Westchester Historical Society in 1929. He concluded that the site of the homestead was on the west side of the Hutchinson River in Eastchester. A map in Barr's book that appeared in the 1929 work shows the property bordering the river in an area that is now called Baychester, between two creeks called Rattlesnake Brook and Black Dog Brook. [...] This area of the Bronx is now highly developed; Rattlesnake Brook is extant, mostly in underground culverts, but Black Dog Brook is defunct.|$|E

The duel was the last trial by combat ever permitted by the Parlement de Paris or the French Kings and the guilt or innocence of its participants has been <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> debate among historians and jurists. The contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart harbours no question over the guilt of Le Gris, whom he considers a villain. Later writers take a different view, including the Grandes Chroniques de France and the works of Jehan de Waurin, who repeat with varying details the tale of another culprit admitting his guilt on his deathbed. [...] Other famous writers who studied the case include Diderot in his Encyclopédie and Voltaire in his Histoire du Parlement de Paris.

40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) with indirect UV detection is {{an interesting}} analytical method {{for the analysis of}} drugs and pharmaceuticals. Good and reproducible capillary quality is needed to develop robust methods and to facilitate method transfer in CE. It is widely accepted that preconditioning procedures are indispensable in capillary electrophoresis in order to achieve reproducibility of migration times and peak areas. In order to explore different aspects of this technique, a set of experiments were performed using vigabatrin as a model drug. The effects of capillary rinsing between each run was investigated using basic (NaOH 0. 1 M) and acidic (phosphoric acid 0. 1 M) -wash cycles. The results of 10 consecutive injection of the model drug after each of the two wash cycles, reveal that more reproducible results obtained when acid-wash cycle was performed as a capillary conditioning protocol. The higher pH changes during basic-wash cycle and its effects on the characteristics of the capillary inner surface were suggested as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>greater</b> variation between consecutive runs...|$|R
