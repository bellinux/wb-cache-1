Actor Noah Emmerich made a guest appearance on the show, portraying the character of Edwin Jenner, {{one of the few}} remaining medical personnel dedicated to eradicating the virus. Emmerich's appearance was formally announced in November 2010. Darabont foreshadowed the development of the episode the same month, alongside predecessors [...] "Vatos" [...] and [...] "Wildfire". [...] "Before it's <b>all</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> done, the opinions and actions of the group are divided." [...] Producer Gale Anne Hurd added, [...] "Stakes are higher, dissension develops, rivalries intensify." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Project 86 {{teamed with}} Slayer {{producer}} Matt Hyde {{to record their}} next album. The record was envisioned as a critique of post-9/11 America and the music industry. Formatted as a concept album, it {{told the story of}} a character attempting to find fulfillment in modern culture. [...] "Songs were written and assembled with a certain ebb and flow in mind," [...] said Schwab, [...] "I approached the album like writing chapters in a book." [...] The group spent over 14 months recording demos for Atlantic, which invested nearly $1,000,000 in the project when it was <b>all</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> done. [...] Because of the pressure to produce radio singles, the sound of the album was quite different from its previous releases, as was Schwab's cryptic lyrics, which represented the frustrations of being stifled creatively and feeling powerless in the process.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by noted horror author Stephen King. King {{initially}} approached series co-star David Duchovny and {{informed him that}} he loved the show and desired to write an episode. Eventually, he called series creator Chris Carter and expressed his desire to write an episode of Millennium instead. Carter agreed, but once more, King {{changed his mind and}} it was decided that he would write an episode of The X-Files. King sent various drafts to Carter from his home in Maine; the two individuals never actually met one another. King's original story had some issues that Carter rewrote. Carter explained, [...] "Stephen wasn't used to writing for Mulder and Scully [...] the Mulder-and-Scully story in his original draft didn't quite work". Carter separated Mulder and Scully in the finalized draft and helped to finalize the script, hence their dual writing credit on the episode. Kim Manners, the director for the episode, later said, [...] "I was very excited to be able to direct a Stephen King piece, and when it was <b>all</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> done, there was very little Stephen King left in it. The nuts and bolts were his, but that was really one of Chris' scripts." [...] Unbeknownst to either Carter or King, the word [...] "Chinga" [...] can be considered a vulgar Spanish colloquialism.|$|E
500|$|H. J. R. Murray {{wrote that}} Staunton's {{response}} to Morphy's initial challenge and his {{article about the}} same in The Illustrated London News should have been interpreted as a courteous refusal of the offer, but that Morphy interpreted them differently, {{and one of the}} main reasons for his visit to Europe in 1858 was the hope of playing a match with Staunton. Murray also commented on the whole affair, [...] "In all this there is but little in which we can reproach Staunton, beyond the fact that he kept open the possibility of a match for so long, and even here there is a good deal that could be urged in justification of the course followed by Staunton" [...] but also noted that both sides were playing tactical games with each other in front of the public, and that comments made by both players or their respective supporters were acrimonious. In response to Morphy's complaints Lord Lyttelton, then president of the British Chess Association, said that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match, but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America, but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match. von der Lasa later wrote, although not specifically about this affair, that he thought there was no chance of Staunton's health being good enough for a serious contest from 1853 onwards. William Norwood Potter wrote in his obituary of Staunton in the City of London Chess Magazine, [...] "...nor were his innuendoes concerning Morphy otherwise than an utterly unworthy means of getting out of an engagement, which he could have either declined with a good grace at first, or afterwards have honourably asked to be released from. Nevertheless, <b>all</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> done, Staunton was, as we have often heard a distinguished enemy of his say, emphatically a MAN. There was nothing weak about him, and he had a backbone that never curved with fear of any one." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 27, {{the first}} day of the Cleveland Browns' {{training}} camp, free-agent center LeCharles Bentley suffered a season-ending knee injury during the first contact play of camp. Bentley was quoted as saying, [...] "No one touched me. It was a freak thing. I took two steps, felt the injury and that was it. It felt like someone had kicked me." [...] Bentley also said that he's [...] " [...] never been a patient person", and that [...] " [...] earning to adjust my body and my limitations is going to be a difficult challenge. When it's <b>all</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> done, it's going to make me better." [...] Bentley was expected to help protect second-year quarterback Charlie Frye.|$|E

Marek bravely stands up to medieval warlords and Archpriests.

When Professor Johnston, Kate, and Chris return to their own world, they find Marek’s grave and discover that he lived a long, happy life in that alternate universe.|$|E
2500|$|Belloc called Sussex [...] "the {{resistant}} county". [...] Writing in 1929, Belloc {{stated that}} [...] "One may {{talk a little}} fantastically but without too much exaggeration of [...] "the Kingdom of Sussex". [...] Writing in 1960s, Ian Nairn stated that despite its relative proximity to London to its north, Sussex looks south - {{the south of the}} county to the sea and the north to the line of the Downs which indicates the sea lying beyond. [...] As the 20th century progressed, the character of Sussex and its dialect and customs eroded, but its people enjoyed a wealthier standard of living. [...] Poverty and isolation had been key to the strength of a distinct Sussex identity; once they were removed, that identity weakened. [...] Sussex's reputation for distinctiveness is repeated in literature. [...] In Stella Gibbons's novel Cold Comfort Farm, Flora Poste, the central character muses that [...] "Sussex, when <b>all</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> done, is not quite like other counties".|$|E
