Cleale left that show {{to be an}} {{understudy}} for Sondheim on Sondheim. Cleale credits Sondheim as {{being one of the}} reasons he went into acting: [...] It's Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine, and I moved to New York to work with them. I was a business major in Miami when I took an acting class, and my teacher said 'I don't think you should be a lawyer. I think you should do this act with your life.' He gave me the cast album of Into the Woods, and I became obsessed with it. I remember going to my final exam in the spring of '89. It was seven in the morning, and I had a tape deck in my car, and I had this tape playing. It was Robert Westenberg singing, and I got fixated on the lyrics. I'm supposed to be thinking about statistics, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> was lyrics. So it was, in fact, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine.|$|E

Pironi survived, but multiple fractures to both of his legs meant he never raced again in Formula 1. In {{the immediate aftermath of the}} accident, he said he felt no pain. [...] "It was just like my accidents before, when I had no injuries. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> was the car, that the spare one didn't work as well as this one, and that I would have to use it (the spare) for the race. Then I saw my legs and I thought maybe I wouldn't be doing this race, after all. In the helicopter, they began to hurt very seriously. But if I was to have this accident, it was lucky for me that it was in Germany and not in a more primitive place." [...] The extent of Pironi's leg fractures was severe; however, contrary to Pironi's account of the accident, medics under the guidance of Professor Sid Watkins did not consider amputation in order to extricate him from the car.|$|E

On 25 January 1977, the Clash signed to CBS Records for £100,000, a remarkable amount for a band that had played a total of about thirty gigs and almost none as a headliner. As Clash historian Marcus Gray describes, the [...] "band members found themselves having to justify deal to both the music press and to fans who picked up on the critics' muttered asides about the Clash having 'sold out' to the establishment." [...] Mark Perry, founder of the leading London punk periodical, Sniffin' Glue, let loose with what he would later call his [...] "big quote": [...] "Punk died the day the Clash signed to CBS." [...] As one band associate described it, the deal [...] "was later used as a classic example of the kind of contract that no group should ever sign—the group had to pay for their own tours, recordings, remixes, artwork, expenses ..." ...|$|E

40|$|To Denise and the kidsAcknowledgements Walking {{across the}} campus of Brigham Young University, I spotted a moth on the {{sidewalk}} near the main library. As I got closer, I saw that the moth was really a Blackchinned Hummingbird injured in a collision with a large plate glass windows. The bird was still breathing, though it barely stirred as I picked it up from the ground. I cupped it {{in my hands and}} walked over to sit down {{in the shade of a}} large tree. I was struck by the senselessness of a tiny bird falling victim to our built environment. After a few minutes, the bird opened its eyes. Ten minutes later it was able to perch on my index finger. After half an hour it was actively looking around. It gave me a final look, then zoomed up to perch in the top of the tree. The bird was gone, but it seemed to have left me with a message, and perhaps a calling. At once fragile and resilient, this little being had stirred within me a desire to help birds thrive in a world increasingly dominated by buildings, pavement, billboards, and the material trappings of our everyday life. Driving around Provo for the next few days, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> was how the city must look to birds. While some bird...|$|E
40|$|As a new {{hurricane}} season opened in June of 2006, it emerged {{that a number}} of online gaming sites were offering bettors the opportunity to wager on whether New Orleans might suffer another Katrina calamity. Commentators condemned the announced practice with howls of disgust, labeling it both tasteless and heartless. Perhaps they were right. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> as one who grew up in New Orleans, however, was how risk pools might hereby be broadened to include all the world’s bettors. We shouldn’t condemn these people; we should use them—while requiring that they maintain margin accounts at their betting sites. For to bet on an event’s happening is a way to insure against it, and there are currently more things we’re able to bet on than to purchase ordinary insurance policies against. This essay elaborates and draws consequences from that observation. In a manner I hope is more concretely appreciable and intuitively graspable than in more technical work I did some years back, I work to show that we have it within our power to spread risks both more justly and more efficiently than we do now—in effect by designing new hedging instruments suitable for “ordinary Janes and Joes. ” In this sense the essay amounts to a contribution to the project of “democratizing” finance. Working along such lines now seems particularly worthwhile, as more and more people below the tops of our income and wealth distributions face more and more uninsurable risks—both to labor incomes and to that one form of wealth which they hold when they hold anything more than mere “human capital”—their homes...|$|E

Rob McElhenney adapted the idea {{after watching the}} Philadelphia Eagles defeat the Dallas Cowboys at Lincoln Financial Field.
