40|$|A T-handle {{has been}} {{designed}} to be used for minimally invasive implantation of a dynamic hip screw to repair fractures of the proximal femur. It is capable of being used in two actions: (i) push and hold (while using an <b>angle</b> <b>guide)</b> and (ii) application of torque when using the insertion wrench and lag screw tap. The T-handle can be held in a power or precision grip. It is suitable for either single (sterilised by γ-irradiation) or multiple (sterilised by autoclaving) use. The principles developed here are applicable to handles {{for a wide range of}} surgical instruments...|$|E
30|$|The module {{was placed}} on a large flat 6.35 -mm-thick steel plate, which was firmly mounted on the base holder of an Instron Ceast- 9350 drop tower. A 12.7 -mm-thick 101.6 -mm-diameter {{circular}} hardened-steel impact head was launched onto the <b>angle</b> <b>guide,</b> with the impact velocity of v = 7.7  m/s. The total drop mass was m = 3.65  kg. The deceleration was measured by an accelerometer embedded in the impact head; the drop-mass displacement was simultaneously recorded by a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). Altogether four sets of modules were tested. Their behaviors were quite similar.|$|E
30|$|The initial {{configuration}} of the battery module is fully folded. Upon the dynamic compressive loading from the drop mass, the tapered cell edge and the impact guide trigger a smooth self-unfolding, aided by the angle support from the bottom. The cells are freely jointed by the hinges, and the motion is quite resistance free and robust. Even when the <b>angle</b> <b>guide</b> and support are damaged, once the self-unfolding begins it would continue until the cell assembly is flattened. During the deformation process, the cells {{are designed to be}} “loading-free”, as long as the frictions are small. As shown in Fig.  2 b, during impact, the stress level in the cells is quite low; stress concentration occurs around the hinges and the top of upper cells. Most of the loadings are carried by the EAE. Therefore, the cell assembly can reach a high deformability, while the cell damage is trivial. According to necessity, additional protection components may be included in the bottom section of the module; hence, when the module self-unfolding completes, direct impact on cell surfaces is minimized.|$|E

40|$|Minimally {{invasive}} surgery (MIS) {{is fast becoming}} a preferred choice for patients and surgeons, due to its biological, aesthetic and commercial benefits. The dynamic hip screw (DHS) is the standard implant {{for the treatment of}} fractures of the proximal femur, which is considered to be the most frequent injury in the elderly. The aim of this research was to develop MIS for the treatment of these fractures utilising the principle and surgical technique of the DHS implant. During the research, a thorough medical device design process was conducted to develop three new medical devices 13 a new <b>angle</b> <b>guide,</b> a new ergonomic T-handle and a new implant. The design process for each of the new medical devices conformed to requirements of the relevant standards. The designs of the new medical devices were verified using methods such as risk analysis, finite element analysis and mechanical testing of manufactured prototype. Finally, an operative technique applying a minimally invasive approach with the new medical devices was developed to treat the fractures of the proximal femur.

40|$|Development of any {{internal}} combustion engine is driven primarily by fuel efficiency and emission requirements. This requires refinement of the in-cylinder flow, mixture formation and combustion processes. Design optimization of the intake/exhaust port, valves and piston bowl is essential to realize the above mentioned requirements. The use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) along with optimization tools can help shorten the design optimization cycle time. Traditional approach of experiments using flow bench testing is very costly as well as time consuming. Moreover CFD allows insight into the minute flow details which otherwise are not capture using flow bench tests. The present study demonstrates the use of optimization technology in improving the intake port design. Design exploration from ANSYS Workbench {{is used in the}} study. The objective {{of the study was to}} maximize the effective flow area in order to optimize the Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (bsfc).

40|$|The flow in a {{horizontal}} shaft bulb turbine is calculated as a two-phase flow with a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD-) -code including cavitation model. The results are compared with experimental results achieved at a closed loop test rig for model turbines. On the model test rig, {{for a certain}} operating point (i. e. volume flow, net head, blade <b>angle,</b> <b>guide</b> vane opening) the pressure behind the turbine is lowered (i. e. the Thomacoefficient s is lowered) and {{the efficiency of the}} turbine is recorded. The measured values can be depicted in a so-called s?break curve or h-s?diagram. Usually, the efficiency is independent of the Thoma-coefficient up to a certain value. When lowering the Thoma-coefficient below this value the efficiency will drop rapidly. Visual observations of the different cavitation conditions complete the experiment. In analogy, several calculations are done for different Thoma-coefficients s and the corresponding hydraulic losses of the runner are evaluated quantitatively. Besides, the fraction of water vapour as an indication {{of the size of the}} cavitation cavity is analyzed qualitatively. The experimentally and the numerically obtained results are compared and show a good agreement. Especially the drop in efficiency can be calculated with satisfying accuracy. This drop in efficiency is of high practical importance since it is one criterion to determine the admissible cavitation in a bulbturbine. The visual impression of the cavitation in the CFDanalysis is well in accordance with the observed cavitation bubbles recorded on sketches and/or photographs...|$|E

The three-dimensional time-averaged incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are adopted to numerically simulate the internal flow field of a tubular pump with fixed and adjustable guide vanes, respectively. Computed results indicate that with the design of adjustable guide vanes and at off-design flow rates the flow conditions inside the diffuser of tubular pump can be improved effectively, and its hydraulic losses can be reduced. When the impeller blade angles are fixed the best efficiency points are within 0. 51 % while adjusting setting <b>angles</b> of <b>guide</b> vanes within a certain range. Under off-design conditions the hydraulic efficiency of tubular pump with adjustable guide vanes can be obviously improved by 1. 70 % at 0. 75 Q 0 and 2. 19 % at 1. 20 Q 0, when the blade angle is 0 degrees and the <b>angle</b> of <b>guide</b> vanes is adjusted to be 2 degrees smaller and larger, respectively...|$|R
