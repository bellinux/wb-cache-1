Each of the city's four-quarters had a sanctuary for a deity considered ancestral to the resident tribe; Malakbel and Aglibol's sanctuary was in the Komare quarter. The Baalshamin sanctuary was in the Ma'zin quarter, the Arsu sanctuary in the Mattabol quarter, and the Atargatis sanctuary in the fourth tribe's quarter.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Roman recruits, {{the vast majority}} of barbarian recruits were probably volunteers, drawn by conditions of service and career prospects that to them probably appeared desirable, in {{contrast to}} their living conditions at home.

Barbarians could be recruited directly, <b>as</b> <b>individuals</b> enrolled into regular regiments, or indirectly, as members of irregular foederati units transformed into regular regiments.|$|E

5|$|Pursuit of {{specific}} and narrow {{areas of interest}} {{is one of the}} most striking possible features of <b>AS.</b> <b>Individuals</b> with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names, without necessarily having a genuine understanding of the broader topic. For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography. This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6. Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused, and often dominate social interaction so much that the entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.|$|E
