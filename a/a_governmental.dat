[...] In addition, if the governing body members of <b>a</b> regional <b>governmental</b> agency are not directly elected, the recall power is also not available to remove those members from the regional governing body. [...] In the foregoing situation, if any expenditure problems were to occur after approval of <b>a</b> regional <b>governmental</b> levy, voters {{will not be able to}} vote any problem governing body members out of office as a political accountability mechanism.

5|$|A British Wind Energy Association report {{gives an}} average {{generation}} cost of onshore wind power of around 3.2 pence (between US 5 and 6 cents) per kW·h (2005).

Similar comparative results with natural gas were obtained in <b>a</b> <b>governmental</b> study in the UK in 2011.
