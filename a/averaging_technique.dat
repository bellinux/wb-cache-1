40|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} fracture in composite structures, {{one of the}} most promising approaches is to model the behaviour of the material at the scale of the ma-terial heterogeneities, which is usually called micro or meso-modelling. In a second step, these fine-scale features can be transferred to the scale of the struc-ture by <b>averaging</b> <b>techniques</b> (on representative vol-ume element or unit cells) or homogenisation. How-ever, in the case of fracture, these upscaling methods cannot be used in the vicinity of cracks, as the sepa-ration of scales necessary for their application is lost.

50|$|The split-ring {{resonator}} (SRR) is {{a common}} metamaterial in use {{for a variety of}} experiments. Magnetic responses (permeability) at terahertz frequencies can be achieved with a structure composed of non-magnetic elements, such as copper-wire SRR, which demonstrate different responses centered around a resonant frequency. Split ring resonators show a capability for tuning across the terahertz regime. Furthermore, the repeating structure made up the constituent materials follows the same strategy of averaging the electromagnetic field as it manipulates and transmits the terahertz radiation This <b>averaging</b> <b>technique</b> is called an effective medium response.|$|E
5000|$|In {{conventional}} DLTS {{the capacitance}} transients are investigated {{by using a}} lock-in amplifier [...] or double box-car <b>averaging</b> <b>technique</b> when the sample temperature is slowly varied (usually in a range from liquid nitrogen temperature to room temperature 300 K or above). The equipment reference frequency is the voltage pulse repetition rate. In the conventional DLTS method this frequency multiplied by some constant (depending on the hardware used) is called the [...] "rate window". During the temperature scan, peaks appear when the emission rate of carriers from some defect equals the rate window. By setting up different rate windows in subsequent DLTS spectra measurements one obtains different temperatures at which some particular peak appears. Having a set of the emission rate and corresponding temperature pairs one can make an Arrhenius plot, which allows for the deduction of defect activation energy for the thermal emission process. Usually this energy (sometimes called the defect energy level) together with the plot intercept value are defect parameters used for its identification or analysis.On samples with low free carrier density conductance transients have also been used for a DLTS analysis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} the {{convergence}} analysis of the cell <b>average</b> <b>technique</b> given by J. Kumar et al.

First, we observed that the cell <b>average</b> <b>technique</b> is second order convergent on a uniform, locally uniform and non-uniform smooth meshes. Secondly, the scheme is examined closely on an oscillatory and non-uniform random meshes. It is found that the scheme is only first accurate there. In spite of this, the cell <b>average</b> <b>technique</b> gives one order higher accuracy than the fixed pivot technique for locally uniform, oscillatory and random meshes. Several numerical simulations verify the mathematical results of the convergence analysis. Finally the numerical results obtained are also compared with those for {{the case of the}} fixed pivot technique...|$|R

40|$|In {{precision}} assemblies, exact constraint {{techniques have}} been used to align removable components in automobile engines, robotics, and many measurement devices. Exact constraint typically requires controlled precision machining to allow an interface to be repeatable and interchangeable. Elastic <b>averaging</b> <b>techniques</b> can be used instead of exact constraint to create slightly less repeatable interfaces with more generous machining requirements. <b>Averaging</b> <b>techniques</b> work by <b>averaging</b> out errors through controlled compliance between precision surfaces. The key to elastic averaging is to control a large number of features spread over a broad region that elastically deform when separate parts are forced into geometric compliance with each other.
