30|$|An {{exemplification}} of foundationalism {{could be}} a consideration of person x towards her sister x*. Person x* is the twin sister of x and so x believes, since she is a normal human being with fears, hopes <b>and</b> <b>wishes,</b> that her sister for her part has fears, hopes <b>and</b> <b>wishes,</b> too. According to that, person x could be pretty sure {{about the fact that}} person x* will have fears, hopes <b>and</b> <b>wishes</b> for the future, which is a properly justified belief about the future. On that foundation, person x could act to improve her sister’s wellbeing in the future, e.g., train her in playing hockey. The important thing is that because she has a basic belief about her sister having fears, hopes <b>and</b> <b>wishes,</b> she could form a non-basic but justified belief about the future.|$|R
