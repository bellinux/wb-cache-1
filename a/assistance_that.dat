In the same news conference Horta said that East Timor, Fretlin Government {{would not accept}} any UN <b>assistance</b> <b>that</b> included Australia.|$|E
5|$|During the {{southern}} party's absence the relief ship Morning arrived, bringing fresh supplies. The expedition's organisers {{had assumed that}} the Discovery would be free from the ice in early 1903, enabling Scott to carry out further seaborne exploration and survey work before winter set in. It was intended that Discovery would return to New Zealand in March or April, then home to England via the Pacific, continuing its magnetic survey en route. Morning would provide any <b>assistance</b> <b>that</b> Scott might require during this period.|$|E
5|$|Earmarking is a {{requirement}} that specifies a limit amount or percentage of the program’s <b>assistance</b> <b>that</b> must (minimum) or may (maximum) be used for specified activities. Examples of this include limits imposed {{on the federal government}} on the amount of federal funds to cover administrative expenses, or a percentage requirement for total program funds provided to subrecipients. Earmarking may also be specified in relation to the types of participants covered (e.g. a limit on how many participants a recipient can provide assistance to).|$|E

5|$|His selflessness and {{strength}} were exemplified {{during this period}} by the <b>assistance</b> <b>that</b> he gave to a fellow worker who had become ill. Johnson would carry two sacks of corn on each journey between the wharf and the grain warehouse, rather than the usual single sack, up an incline so steep that it was known as Labour-in-vain-hill. He gave the extra money he earned {{to the family of}} the sick man until he was able to return work.|$|E
5|$|Pipeline {{construction}} {{ended in}} 1977, beginning a gradual decline in Fairbanks' economy. The loss of construction spending was mostly offset by state spending. Taxes on oil {{flowing through the}} pipeline were spent on low-interest loans, grants, and business <b>assistance</b> <b>that</b> poured money into the city. To entice businesses to return to downtown Fairbanks, the city demolished many of the bars favored by pipeline workers and attempted to attract a hotel or major business to the location. This effort was unsuccessful, and the land remained vacant until the late 1990s. Redevelopment of the Fairbanks airport was more successful. A new terminal built in 1984 functioned until 2009.|$|E
5|$|This {{compliance}} requirement establishes {{that any}} non-federal recipient of federal <b>assistance</b> <b>that</b> passes that assistance, whether in part or in total, to another recipient (known as pass-through entities and subrecipients, respectively) {{is responsible to}} monitor the federal assistance activities of that subrecipient, as well as assure that they are both complying with laws and regulations. This requirement {{is based on the}} fact that they are both equally responsible for federal funds received. Subrecipient monitoring may consist of site visits, regular contact, interviews, meetings and examinations of the subrecipient, as well as requiring that the subrecipient be subject to an annual single audit.|$|E

5|$|A {{joint line}} through the Denburn Valley to link the Great North to the south had been planned, and the Great North had {{approached}} the railways using the Guild Street station in 1853 and 1857 but were unhappy with the <b>assistance</b> <b>that</b> had been offered. Permission was granted in 1861 to the Inverness & Perth Junction Railway to build a line from , on the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway, direct to Perth. The Great North protested, and won the right for a booking office in Inverness. The line opened in 1863 and in 1865 the Inverness & Perth Junction and Inverness & Aberdeen Junction merged to become the Highland Railway. The Aberdeen Railway, which had now been absorbed by the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER), approached the Great North, concerned that the new line had bypassed Aberdeen, but no agreement was reached.|$|E
5|$|In January 2000, Baird {{unveiled}} {{a series of}} initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system. This was highlighted by {{the establishment of a}} welfare fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later, in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social <b>assistance</b> <b>that</b> people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs. In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.|$|E

25|$|Obstruction of {{humanitarian}} aid during 1990s famine: During the worst period of mass starvation, the State impeded {{the delivery of}} food aid by imposing conditions that were not based on humanitarian considerations.

25|$|In a {{study of}} federal {{investment}} in the fishery sector, most aspects of United States tax, fisheries, and societal policies were examined {{to see whether they}} created subsidies for the fishing industry and whether these subsidies had impacts. The gross value of direct U.S. subsidies was about 0.5% of the gross ex-vessel value of commercial landings. There are no major ship construction subsidies, market development or other forms of <b>assistance</b> <b>that</b> often exist in developed and developing fishing industries around the world.|$|E
25|$|Billy Murdoch won the toss for Australia {{and chose}} to bat first. The {{decision}} proved a poor one though, as Australia were easily skittled {{out for a}} meagre 63 in 80 overs, taking just over 2 hours. The captain himself tried to offer resistance with a slow defensive 13, and experienced wicket-keeper/batsman Jack Blackham top-scored with 17, but the only other batsman to reach double-figures was Tom Garrett with 10. Inspired bowling from opening bowler Ted Peate who took 4 for 31, and Dick Barlow who produced a devastating 5 for 19, ripped the Australian batting order apart on a greenish wicket that gave more <b>assistance</b> <b>that</b> it first seemed.|$|E
25|$|In Leopold's years Italy was {{engulfed in}} popular rebellion, {{culminating}} in the Revolutions of 1848. The said revolution toppled the throne of France, and caused disarray across Europe. In Tuscany, Leopold II sanctioned a liberal constitution; and instituted a liberal ministry. Despite his attempts at acquiescence, street fighting {{in opposition to the}} regime sprang up in August, in Livorno. Leopold II lent his support to the Kingdom of Sardinia in the Austro-Sardinian War. In February 1849, Leopold II had to abandon Tuscany to Republicans and sought refuge in the Neapolitan city of Gaeta. A provisional republic was established in his stead. It was only with Austrian <b>assistance</b> <b>that</b> Leopold could return to Florence. The constitution was revoked in 1852. The Austrian garrison was withdrawn in 1855.|$|E

Hence, IOSR assisted operation tasks only ask users for SRSubjects entry and require no further user interventions.|$|R
