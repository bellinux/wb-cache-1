30|$|Add new CRDL files In {{the middle}} size {{scenario}} {{run on the}} laptop computer the fulfilment of an <b>add</b> <b>request</b> on server side took 262 milliseconds in average with the four slowest responses between 6 and 11 seconds. 88 percent of the requests were answered in less than 0.3 seconds and 99.8 percent took less than 2 seconds.

40|$|We {{describe}} a rearrangement {{of the standard}} expansion of the symmetry breaking part of the QCD effective Lagrangian that includes into each order additional terms which in the standard chiral perturbation theory (χPT) are relegated to higher orders. The new expansion represents a systematic and unambiguous generalization of the standard χPT, and {{is more likely to}} converge rapidly. It provides a consistent framework for a measurement of the importance of additional "higher order" terms whose smallness is usually assumed but has never been checked. A method of measuring, among other quantities, the QCD parameters m̂〈q̅q〉 and the quark mass ratio m_s/m̂ is elaborated in detail. The method is illustrated using various sets of available data. Both of these parameters might be considerably smaller than their respective leading order standard χPT values. The importance of new, more accurate, experimental information on low-energy π-π scattering is stressed.
