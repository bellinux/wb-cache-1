5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style of the windows are all asymmetrical in nature, {{a hallmark of the}} Arts and Crafts style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movement.</b> This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E

5|$|William Morris (24 March 1834 – 3 October 1896) was an English textile designer, poet, novelist, translator, {{and socialist}} activist. Associated with the British <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>Movement,</b> {{he was a}} major {{contributor}} to the revival of traditional British textile arts and methods of production. His literary contributions helped to establish the modern fantasy genre, while he {{played a significant role in}} propagating the early socialist movement in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Architectural designs {{resembling}} plants {{appear in}} the capitals of Ancient Egyptian columns, which were carved to resemble either the Egyptian white lotus or the papyrus. Ancient Greek columns of the Corinthian order are decorated with acanthus leaves. Islamic art, too, makes frequent use of plant motifs and patterns, including on column capitals. These designs became increasingly elaborate and stylised, appearing as complex arabesque and geometric motifs in objects such as the Ardabil Carpet and ten-pointed Persian ceramic star tiles, influencing the decorative arts in the Western world in such forms as the Rococo and later the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Crane {{illustrated}} and Evans printed, The Baby's Bouquet: a Fresh Bunch of Old Rhymes and Tunes, {{which went}} on to sell {{hundreds of thousands of}} copies. The book shows influences ranging from the Pre-Raphaelites, Japanese art to the incipient <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>crafts</b> <b>movement.</b> In 1889, Flora's Feast: A Masque of Flowers was published, featuring flowers represented as human figures, for which Evans used as many as eight colour blocks. Their later collaborations includes an edition of Alice in Wonderland with coloured versions of John Tenniel's 1890 illustrations, and the 1899 A Floral Fantasy in an Old English Garden.|$|E

5|$|The {{library is}} {{designed}} {{with an eye}} toward late 19th century and early 20th century movements in architecture. While it contains many elements common to Classical Revival architecture the building's asymmetry and playfully creative style are distinctly characteristic of the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>Movement.</b> The building was designed by the Chicago architectural firm of Pond and Pond and is constructed of buff colored brick. Red brick belt coursing and accents contrast the buff colored brick on the majority of the facade. The two-story Oregon Public Library has a full brick basement and approximately 5,500 foot² (511 m²) of floor space.|$|E
5|$|After {{working and}} {{training}} in Bolton and Manchester, Holden moved to London. His early buildings were influenced by the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>Movement,</b> {{but for most of}} his career he championed an unadorned style based on simplified forms and massing that was free of what he considered to be unnecessary decorative detailing. Holden believed strongly that architectural designs should be dictated by buildings' intended functions. After the First World War he increasingly simplified his style and his designs became pared-down and modernist, influenced by European architecture. He {{was a member of the}} Design and Industries Association and the Art Workers' Guild. He produced complete designs for his buildings including the interior design and architectural fittings.|$|E
5|$|As the Biddulphs were {{interested}} in the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movement,</b> using the manor house to give classes for villagers in crafts such as woodwork and embroidery. There were also plays and musical events for the villagers, including puppet shows for the children. Construction was paused during World War I and Barnsley died in 1926. The final part of the build was completed between 1926 and 1929 under the supervision of his brother, Sidney and his son-in-law, Norman Jewson. The built took a total of 23 years, largely due to the traditional methods being used, but also as no contractor was hired to manage the build.|$|E
50|$|Sophia St John Whitty (4 November 1877 - 26 February 1924) was an Irish woodcarver, teacher, and cooperativist. Whitty {{was part}} of the Irish Celtic {{cultural}} revival <b>and</b> the Irish <b>Art</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|R

50|$|As {{part of the}} <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movement's</b> {{efforts to}} make <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>crafts</b> more {{accessible}} to a wider audience, in 1880 the school published the Handbook of Embroidery. Over a century later, in 2011, the school reprinted the work with a preface essay by Lynn Hulse.|$|R
5|$|Decorative tiles {{designed}} by Henry Chapman Mercer—one {{of the leading}} figures of the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>Movement</b> in the U.S.—are placed throughout the building. These tiles (known as Moravian tiles after Mercer's Moravian Pottery and Tile Works) feature deep colors and a handmade appearance that complement the simple brick buildings. The tiles on the fireplaces and entry floors boast patterns in literary and educational themes, such as The Canterbury Tales in the old library. A large, tripartite tile mural on the north wall of the courtyard, also by Mercer, depicts the eastern and western hemispheres united by a ship on an allegorical journey of education.|$|E
5|$|Though Arts and Crafts is {{specifically}} {{regarded as a}} movement within architecture, {{as opposed to a}} full-blown style, there are elements that are considered typical to buildings designed in the style. Examples include, dark, heavy woodwork and very simple ornamentation. The Oregon Public Library contains functional elements associated with that movement. Dark woodwork is found throughout the building, first in the stairwell to the gallery and its balusters and newel posts and then in the four-panel wooden interior door. The ceilings are coffered and have exposed wooden beams. Also located in the interior is a large 1909 wooden floor clock, a built-in storage cabinet, and two wooden fuse boxes that all evoke the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century it was rented by a farmer for storage. Because of its poor {{condition}} it was recommended for demolition in both 1896 and 1901. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings organised a public appeal {{to raise money}} for repairs to which Jane Morris, Thomas Hardy and George Bernard Shaw contributed. As the funding for the restoration was no longer an issue the building was acquired, in 1911, by the National Trust who employed Ernest Barnsley of the Barnsley brothers, the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movement</b> master builders, to design and the work. It was carried out by Norman Jewson and William Weir. The work left in place and strengthened earlier structures where possible but added new aspects including a stone buttress and a kitchen range.|$|E
50|$|When founded, {{the school}} {{promoted}} the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movement's</b> philosophy <b>and</b> its collection includes metalwork, jewellery, wallpapers, a tapestry made by Morris & Co. designed by Edward Burne-Jones, Whitefriars glass by James Powell and Sons and George Henry Walton, silverware by Charles Robert Ashbee and ceramics from Pilkington's Art Pottery.|$|R

50|$|The Studio: An Illustrated Magazine of Fine <b>and</b> Applied <b>Art</b> was an {{illustrated}} fine <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> decorative <b>arts</b> magazine published in London from 1893 until 1964. The founder and first editor was Charles Holme. The magazine exerted {{a major influence}} {{on the development of the}} <b>Art</b> Nouveau <b>and</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movements.</b> It was absorbed into Studio International magazine in 1964.|$|R
5|$|The Oregon Library was {{designed}} by Chicago architects Pond and Pond. The Ponds {{were members of the}} Eagle's Nest Art Colony, founded by Lorado Taft, and their association with Taft and the colony led them to design the library. Their design was influenced by the colony, and a combination of two architectural styles, Classical Revival and the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movement.</b> The completed library included a second floor art gallery to which members of Eagle's Nest donated works for a permanent collection. The gallery's collection includes 64 paintings and sculptures as well as a Currier and Ives lithograph collection appraised at US$700,000. The Oregon Public Library was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2003, three years later it was included as a contributing property in a historic district that received the National Register designation.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginnings}} of the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movement</b> in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by James Ballantine (1808–77). His major works included the great west window of Dunfermline Abbey and the scheme for St. Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by Daniel Cottier (1838–91), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by William Morris, Ford Madox Brown and John Ruskin. His key works included the Baptism of Christ in Paisley Abbey (c. 1880). His followers included Stephen Adam and his son of the same name. The Glasgow-born designer and theorist Christopher Dresser (1834–1904) {{was one of the}} first, and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the Aesthetic Movement and a major contributor to the allied Anglo-Japanese movement.|$|E
5|$|Hollamby {{was born}} in his parental home of 6 Wellesley Avenue in Hammersmith, West London. He was the oldest of two sons born to Ethel May Hollamby, née Kingdom (1899/1900–1966), and Edward Thomas Hollamby (1893–1978), a police constable. His primary {{education}} took place at St. Peter's Church School, before he won a scholarship to study at a junior technical school. From there, he gained a higher education by training in architecture at the nearby Hammersmith School of Arts and Crafts during the 1930s. At the college, he {{was inspired by the}} Arts and Crafts aesthetic propounded by one of his lecturers, Alwyn Waters, and through him came to take an interest in William Morris, who had been a pioneer of the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movement</b> {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century. At the same time, Hollamby was influenced by the modernist movement in architecture to which two of his favourite lecturers, Arthur Ling and Alex Lowe, belonged, and joined the Modern Architectural Research Group (MARS).|$|E
50|$|The <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>craft</b> <b>movement</b> {{which started}} in the United Kingdom {{in the middle of}} the 19th century spurred a market for {{traditional}} cabinet making, <b>and</b> other <b>craft</b> goods. It rapidly spread to the United States and to all the countries in the British Empire. This movement exemplified the reaction to the eclectic historicism of the Victorian era and to the 'soulless' machine-made production which was starting to become widespread.|$|R
50|$|Thomson's art bears some stylistic {{resemblance}} {{to the work of}} European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cézanne, whose work he may have known from books or visits to art galleries. Other key influences were the <b>Art</b> Nouveau <b>and</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movements</b> of {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries, styles with which he would have been familiar from his work in the graphic arts.|$|R
50|$|The RBSA was {{to become}} a highly {{influential}} body in the later Victorian period, particularly within the Pre-Raphaelite <b>and</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movements.</b> Its members included some of the most significant figures in English <b>art,</b> <b>and</b> presidents during the period included artists of the stature of Edward Burne-Jones, William Morris, John Everett Millais and Lord Leighton. Members of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists are entitled to use the post-nominal letters RBSA.|$|R
5|$|Nineteenth and {{twentieth century}} avant-garde artistic {{movements}} {{took an interest}} in the typographical arts, greatly enriching book design and illustration. In the late nineteenth century, William Morris founded the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movement,</b> which emphasized the value of traditional craft skills that seemed to be disappearing in the mass industrial age. His designs, like the work of the Pre-Raphaelite painters with whom he was associated, referred frequently to medieval motifs. In 1891 he founded the Kelmscott Press, which by the time it closed in 1898 had produced over fifty works using traditional printing methods, a hand-driven press and hand-made paper. They included his masterpiece, an edition of the Works of Geoffrey Chaucer with illustrations by Edward Burne-Jones. Morris also invented three distinctive typefaces - Golden, Troy, and Chaucer, with the text being framed with intricate floral borders similar to illuminated medieval manuscripts. His work inspired many small private presses in the following century.|$|E
5|$|The Indianapolis Museum of Art {{was founded}} as the Art Association of Indianapolis, an open-membership {{group led by}} the suffragist May Wright Sewall. Formed in 1883, the {{organization}} aimed {{to inform the public}} about visual art and provide art education. The Art Association's first exhibition, which opened November 7, 1883, contained 453 artworks from 137 artists. The death of wealthy Indianapolis resident John Herron in 1895 left a substantial bequest with the stipulation that the money be used for a gallery and a school with his name. The John Herron Art Institute opened in 1902 at the corner of 16th and Pennsylvania street. Emphasis on the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movement</b> grew throughout {{the early years of the}} school, with a focus on applied art. William Henry Fox was hired in 1905 as the Art Institute's first director. From 1905 to 1910, Fox managed both the museum and the school while constructing two new buildings on the 16th street site.|$|E
5|$|The {{gardens are}} Grade II* {{listed on the}} Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The gardens of the house were also created {{in line with the}} <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movement,</b> {{providing}} food for the house. Influenced strongly by Margaret Bidulph, who had studied at Studley Horticultural College, where she had met her future head gardener William Scrubey. Scrubey and Margaret Biddulph would go on to plant the gardens together. The terrace and gardens south to the south of the house include yew hedges to create specific spaces, mixed with Portuguese laurels and roses, giving the impression of exterior rooms next to the house. Nearby is an area of topiary, clipped in domes and tiers. At {{the far end of the}} south terrace is a ha-ha, leading to a cherry orchard and tennis courts, although only one tennis court remains, the others have been converted in a croquet lawn and a swimming pool.|$|E
50|$|Calligraphic writing {{continued}} {{to play a role}} long after the introduction of the printing press in the West, official documents being drawn up in engrossed or handwritten form well into the 18th century. A revival of calligraphy in the later 19th century was associated with the <b>Art</b> Nouveau <b>and</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movements,</b> <b>and</b> it continues to be practiced, typically commissioned for private purposes such as wedding invitations, logo design, memorial documents, etc.|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} used {{a greater}} variety of styles when working on country houses, including Elizabethan and Jacobean elements as well as Gothic. Other features were incorporated {{towards the end of the}} 19th century similar to those in works produced by the Aesthetic <b>and</b> the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>Movements.</b> Not all the firm's work was on a large scale; as the major architectural practice in North West England they also undertook work on schools, vicarages, hospitals, factories, hotels, shops, railway stations, and war memorials.|$|R
50|$|In 1909 Chapman-Taylor {{travelled}} to England {{to study}} and meet first hand the works of C.F.A. Voysey, Baille Scott, and Parker and Unwin whose names were famous {{in the field of}} domestic architecture. Upon his return to New Zealand Chapman-Taylor was determined to follow the basic principles on which good domestic architecture had been developed - designing and building houses with skill and sensitivity. He was influenced by the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> <b>movement's</b> interpretation of rural English cottage construction and style and returned to New Zealand to integrate this into New Zealand materials and settings.|$|R
