5|$|Servicing of No. 32 Squadron {{passed from}} the RAF to the private company Fields Aviation Services in April 1985, then to Lovaux <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Servicing</b> in 1990. In 1991, the Station Flight was established, taking {{delivery}} of two Britten-Norman Islanders in December which entered service in January 1992. No. 32 Squadron celebrated its Diamond Jubilee in 1991, {{at a time when}} personnel became involved in operations during the Gulf War. No. 38 Group RAF assumed control of RAF Northolt on 2 November 1992 following a wider restructuring of the RAF. On 16 December 1994, the new southside Operations Building opened, replacing the old Northolt Airport Terminal building. With the reorganisation of RAF Strike Command on 1 April 2000, No. 38 Group was disbanded and Northolt came under the control of No. 2 Group RAF.|$|E
5|$|As {{test flights}} {{conducted}} by No. 617 Squadron proved {{that it was}} not possible to make a return trip to Kaafjord from Scotland, and an evaluation of the main airstrip in the Shetlands determined that it was unsuitable for Lancasters, No. 5 Group's staff officers judged that it would be necessary for the aircraft to refuel in the Soviet Union. Detailed investigation of the airstrips near Murmansk found that they were at best marginal for heavy bombers and had almost no accommodation or <b>aircraft</b> <b>servicing</b> facilities. Moreover, the airstrips were vulnerable to attack from fighters operating from nearby German bases. Instead, it was decided that the attack force should fly over northern Sweden and Finland after raiding Kaafjord and refuel at Yagodnik airstrip, which was located on an island near Arkhangelsk. This plan was accepted by the Air Ministry on 6 September. Soviet Naval Aviation offered to attack German fighter bases at the same time as the British bombers arrived over the target area, but No. 5 Group rejected this proposal and requested that Soviet aircraft not fly near Kaafjord, to avoid alerting the Germans.|$|E
25|$|Externally, Concourse C and Concourse B {{before their}} {{reconstruction}} were radically {{different than the}} terminal structure, consisting of straight radial spokes clad with white panels. Concourse C included a circular end which invokes {{the appearance of the}} terminal, whereas Concourse B terminated at a flat wall. The concourse walls had relatively few windows, typically at waiting and dining areas. The presence of multiple shops, restrooms and service areas reduced the need for windows in the concourses. Jetways were used {{for the majority of the}} gates and aircraft, though Delta Connection and United Express used stairs leading to the tarmac to board flights on regional jets (currently all flights at the new concourses use jetways). Passenger gates and services are located on the second floor with airside baggage handling and <b>aircraft</b> <b>servicing</b> on the ground level.|$|E
