30|$|In summary, the {{addition}} of particulate fillers may be of interest towards improving bond performance and saving adhesive. Therefore, the present study focuses on expanding the available portfolio of potential particulate fillers <b>for</b> wood <b>adhesives.</b> Ideally, particulate filler should show good surface-chemical compatibility with UF, and a high specific surface area. These prerequisites are fulfilled by UF-microspheres [21], which are chemically identical with an UF wood adhesive and comprise of a high specific surface area. In the present study, UF-microspheres are synthesised and their suitability as an <b>additive</b> <b>for</b> improving UF <b>adhesive</b> bonds is elucidated.|$|R
40|$|If {{monocotyledons}} {{are to be}} used in particleboards, their {{external surfaces}} should be modified to increase their wettability by conventional adhesives such as melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF). The modification should affect the wax layer of the external surface of monocotyledons. According to the literature, modification by enzymes leads to increased wettability by water-based adhesives. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the integration of surface treatment by enzymes into particleboard production in a way that leads to a value added output. During the pre-treatment process, it can be expected that residues such as fines and organic acids will accumulate. These residues can be used for methane production, and this should increase the efficiency of the process. Once established, the methane production can be extended to include other residues from the wood process, leading to an increased energy production. A residue of this methane process is lignin which is nowadays generally used as a fertilizer and energy source, but research is also focusing on the use of lignin as an adhesive or additive. A SWOT analysis of the literature shows the advantages and disadvantages of integrating a pre-treatment of monocotyledons into the particleboard production process. In addition to a mixture of light-weight raw material for particleboard production, energy and maybe <b>additives</b> <b>for</b> <b>adhesives,</b> this concept also supports the production of panels with a greater range of densities by using different proportions of the different raw materialsGodkänd; 2014; 20140728 (dicsan...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{this paper}} is the {{generalization}} of parallelism and concurrency results <b>for</b> <b>adhesive</b> High-Level Replacement (HLR) systems to adhesive HLR systems with negative application conditions. These conditions restrict the application of a rule by expressing that a specific structure should not be present before or after applying the rule to a certain context. Such a condition influences thus each rule application or transformation and therefore changes significantly the properties of the replacement system. The effect of negative application conditions on parallelism and concurrency in the replacement system is described in the generalization of the following results, formulated already <b>for</b> <b>adhesive</b> HLR systems without negative application conditions: Local Church-Rosser Theorem, Parallelism Theorem and Concurrency Theorem. These important generalized results will support the development of formal analysis techniques <b>for</b> <b>adhesive</b> HLR systems with negative application conditions...|$|R
