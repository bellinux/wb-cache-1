5|$|Facing {{creative}} stagnation and {{a backlash}} following their documentary/double album, Rattle and Hum (1988), U2 reinvented {{themselves in the}} 1990s through a new musical direction and public image. Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album, Achtung Baby (1991), and the multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour, the band integrated influences from alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music into their sound, and embraced a more ironic, flippant image. This experimentation continued through their ninth album, Pop (1997), and the PopMart Tour, which were mixed successes. U2 regained critical and commercial favour with the records <b>All</b> <b>That</b> <b>You</b> Can't Leave Behind (2000) and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), which established a more conventional, mainstream sound for the group. Their U2 360° Tour of 2009–2011 is the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour in history. The group's thirteenth album, Songs of Innocence (2014), was released at no cost through the iTunes Store, but received criticism for its automatic placement in users' music libraries.|$|E

25|$|A {{few years}} after Miró’s 1918 Barcelona solo exhibition, he settled in Paris where he {{finished}} a number of paintings that he had begun on his parents’ summer home and farm in Mont-roig del Camp. One such painting, The Farm, showed a transition to a more individual style of painting and certain nationalistic qualities. Ernest Hemingway, who later purchased the piece, compared the artistic accomplishment to James Joyce’s Ulysses and described it by saying, “It has in it <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> feel about Spain when you are there and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> feel when you are away and cannot go there. No one else {{has been able to}} paint these two very opposing things.” Miró annually returned to Mont-roig and developed a symbolism and nationalism that would stick with him throughout his career. Two of Miró’s first works classified as Surrealist, Catalan Landscape (The Hunter) and The Tilled Field, employ the symbolic language that was to dominate the art of the next decade.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the {{recording}} sessions for the band's 1984 album The Unforgettable Fire, U2 {{wanted to work}} with Brian Eno on the album. However, Eno assumed that they were an [...] "uninteresting rock band" [...] and he was not interested in working with them. He changed his mind after listening to the Red Rocks concert and produced The Unforgettable Fire and several other U2 recordsincluding The Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby, and <b>All</b> <b>That</b> <b>You</b> Can't Leave Behind, which are among the band's most successfulalongside his sound engineer Daniel Lanois.|$|E
500|$|The song is a midtempo R and hip hop ballad that [...] "mixes a soft {{beat with}} piano accompaniment." [...] Its lyrics convey {{a message of}} self-worth and perseverance, with Carey urging {{listeners}} to [...] "Reach for the stars/ Be <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are." [...] The song made little impact commercially; many felt the singer was overshadowed by the hip-hop duo, and should have had more presence on her comeback single. Two accompanying versions were released alongside the original, titled the [...] "Pulse Club" [...] and [...] "Vintage Throwback" [...] remixes. Like the reception, commercial impact has been generally low. Most critics attribute this to the song's low appeal to Top 40 formats and mainstream channels.|$|E
500|$|His corps {{suffered}} through a severe winter in Eastern Tennessee with inadequate shelter and provisions. Writing to Georgia's Quartermaster General, Ira Roe Foster on January 24, 1864, Longstreet noted: [...] "There are five Georgia Brigades in this Army [...] Wofford's, G.T. Anderson's, Bryan's, Benning's, and Crews' cavalry brigade. They are all alike in excessive need of shoes, clothing of all kinds, and blankets. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can send will be thankfully received." [...] Meanwhile, Longstreet again developed strategic plans. He {{called for an}} offensive through Tennessee into Kentucky in which his command would be bolstered by P. G. T. Beauregard and 20,000 men. Although he had the concurrence of Gen. Lee, Longstreet was unable to convince President Davis or his newly appointed military advisor, Braxton Bragg.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the mixed}} {{success of their}} musical pursuits in the 1990s, U2 sought to simplify their sound; the Edge said that with Pop, the group had [...] "taken the deconstruction of the rock 'n' roll band format to its {{absolute}} 'nth degree". For their tenth album, <b>All</b> <b>That</b> <b>You</b> Can't Leave Behind, the group wanted {{to return to their}} old recording ethos of [...] "the band in a room playing together". Reuniting with Eno and Lanois, U2 began working on the album in late 1998. After their experiences with being pressured to complete Pop, the band were content to work without deadlines. With Bono's schedule limited by his commitments to debt relief for Jubilee 2000 and the other band members spending time with their families, the recording sessions stretched through August 2000.|$|E
500|$|Looking for a harder-hitting rock sound {{than that}} of <b>All</b> <b>That</b> <b>You</b> Can't Leave Behind, U2 began {{recording}} their eleventh studio album, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, in February 2003 with producer Chris Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, {{but they were not}} satisfied with the results; Mullen said that the songs [...] "had no magic". The group subsequently enlisted Steve Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Jacknife Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Lanois, Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record's [...] "sonic cohesion".|$|E
500|$|Sales of {{the album}} stalled midway through 2009. By October, just over onemillion copies had been sold in the US, the group's lowest {{in more than a}} decade. Through March 2014, the album's {{lifetime}} sales in the country totaled 1.1 million copies. In the UK, the record sold {{less than a third of}} How to Dismantle an Atomic Bombs figures, and a quarter of <b>All</b> <b>That</b> <b>You</b> Can't Leave Behinds. Global sales of No Line on the Horizon remained at fivemillion copies through September 2010. The album did not generate a hit single; ABC noted that sales of How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb had been propelled by the track [...] "Vertigo" [...] which, although not a chart success, had become well-known to the public from its use in iPod commercials.|$|E

500|$|U2 {{developed}} [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] from a {{song called}} [...] "Scott Walker," [...] an outtake from the band's 1997 album Pop. This incarnation, written as an homage to the singer of the same name, was only an outline when the recording sessions for Pop concluded. The group reworked it in preparation for their 2000 album <b>All</b> <b>That</b> <b>You</b> Can't Leave Behind, but the song was still unfinished when that album was released. They rewrote the song for their 2004 album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "There was a melody and a groove that ultimately didn't go anywhere and we kind of threw out everything, found chords that worked with that melody and built it back up, new drum parts, new bass parts, new guitars." ...|$|E
500|$|On 3 February 2002, U2 {{performed}} {{during the}} halftime show of Super Bowl XXXVI.

SI.com, Rolling Stone, and USA Today ranked the band's performance as the best halftime show in Super Bowl history. Later that month, U2 received four additional Grammy Awards; <b>All</b> <b>That</b> <b>You</b> Can't Leave Behind won Best Rock Album, while [...] "Walk On" [...] was named Record of the Year, marking the first time an artist had won the latter award in consecutive years for songs from the same album.

500|$|Robert Vagacs, {{author of}} the book Religious Nuts, Political Fanatics: U2 in the Theological Perspective, {{describes}} the song as the antimatter of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name", in both musical and thematic aspects. Vagacs discusses the concept of Zooropa in detail throughout the book, and refers to Zooropa as a [...] "wasteland" [...] and a [...] "dystopia", due to its lack of fulfilment and certainty. [...] He also states how the Babylonian-like location uses its demigods to control its people through scientism, technicism, and economism. [...] The final track from Achtung Baby, [...] "Love Is Blindness", is described as [...] "an interpretive bridge into the land of Zooropa", which Vagacs explains is the setting for the album, as well as the setting for songs on U2's following album, Pop. [...] "Beautiful Day", the opening song from U2's 2000 album, <b>All</b> <b>That</b> <b>You</b> Can't Leave Behind, describes [...] "a fresh start in Zooropa".|$|E

The song begins with an introductory verse from Mill, followed by Ross on the second verse. Though [...] "cooing" [...] throughout the chorus, Carey's begins singing during the song's bridge and final crescendo, where she displays her whistle register. The track opens with Mill, whose verse quickly sums up {{the theme of the}} track: [...] "The only way {{to make it to the}} top is if you go and get it from the bottom ... I remember they said that it ain't my turn/ Just look at me now/ Try to hold me down, but I ain't gonna stop/ 'Cause I'm gonna climb to the mountaintop." [...] During the song's chorus, Carey sings of not being able to be torn down by others and [...] "staying triumphant", before continuing: [...] "Don't let 'em ever count you out/ Realize all things are possible/ In your heart who's the greatest/ Reach for the stars/ Be <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are." ...|$|E
500|$|At Trenton, Washington faced a dilemma. All but {{a handful}} of his men's enlistments were expiring on December 31, and he knew that the army would {{collapse}} unless he convinced them to stay. So, on the 30th, Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars. He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks, but not a man turned out. Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops, saying [...] "My brave fellows, you have done all I asked you to do, and more than could be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, but we know not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay only one month longer, you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably never can do under any other circumstances."
