5|$|Garran {{joked that}} the long work of the {{drafting}} committee breached the Factory Acts, the group (primarily Barton, Richard O'Connor, John Downer and Garran) often working {{late into the night}} preparing drafts for the convention to consider and debate the next morning. On the evening before the convention's last day, Barton had gone to bed exhausted in the small hours, Garran and Charles Gavan Duffy finishing the final schedule of amendments <b>at</b> <b>breakfast</b> time. The convention concluded successfully, approving a final draft which would ultimately, aside from a small amendment arranged at the last minute in London, become the Constitution of Australia.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1946 Geoffrey de Havilland Jr {{was killed}} test-flying the DH.108 Swallow over the Thames estuary.

Cunningham knew the family well and contacted his father, whose other son John had been killed in a collision while flying a Mosquito in 1943. With the agreement of de Havilland senior, Cunningham took the dead pilot's post which earned him £2,000 per year.|$|E
5|$|Global {{announced}} on 12 August 2013 that Real and Smooth would relocate their London and West Midlands offices to Global premises. Smooth Radio's output was relocated to Global's Leicester Square headquarters from 1 October, {{a move that}} coincided with a major overhaul of its schedule, and the closure of Smooth 70s after 21 months on air. On 4 February 2014, the Radio Today website reported that Ofcom had given Global Radio permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform, and {{to replace it with}} a service playing music from the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Under this agreement, Smooth would continue to broadcast on its regional frequencies, but would be required to provide seven hours of local output per day. On 6 February, Global confirmed the sale of eight of its regional stationsincluding those with the Smooth Radio brand in the North West, North East and East Midlandsto the Irish media holdings company Communicorp. Under a franchising agreement between the two firms, these stations would retain the Smooth Radio name, but relaunch airing a mixture of both regional content and networked programming from London. Smooth would also take over Gold's medium wave frequencies, except in London, Manchester and the East Midlands. Global announced later that month that Smooth would be relaunched from 3 March, and subsequently confirmed the Gold changes would take effect from 24 March, when the stations would begin simulcasting with Smooth Radio London. This also coincided with the return of local programming <b>at</b> <b>breakfast</b> and drivetime.|$|E

25|$|Hankey {{tried to}} {{institute}} weekly breakfasts between Lloyd George and Robertson, but these had failed as Lloyd George liked to sit talking {{for a long}} time after breakfast. Although he cultivated a myth that he never read, Lloyd George was in fact a very early riser, who would have already have completed much of the day's paperwork before breakfast, and therefore preferred to do business <b>at</b> <b>breakfast</b> meetings rather than in the evening. Austen Chamberlain found the practice equally irritating.|$|E
25|$|In some areas, {{where more}} land is available, sewage is treated in large round or oval ditches {{with one or}} more {{horizontal}} aerators typically called brush or disc aerators which drive the mixed liquor around the ditch and provide aeration.

They have the advantage that they are relatively easy to maintain and are resilient to shock loads that often occur in smaller communities (i.e. <b>at</b> <b>breakfast</b> time and in the evening).|$|E
