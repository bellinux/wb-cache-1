5|$|Alpine areas, such {{as those}} of Kosciuszko National Park, are <b>at</b> <b>particular</b> risk; low-growing alpine flora is highly {{vulnerable}} to trampling, and the short summers mean little time for plants to grow and recover from damage. The biodiversity there is high, with 853 species of plant, 21 of which are found nowhere else. Erosion in the limestone karst areas leads to runoff and silting. Sphagnum moss is an important component of highland bogs, and is trampled by horses seeking water.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>particular</b> {{issue was}} {{the ability of}} sensors to {{differentiate}} an underground test from an earthquake. There were four techniques examined: measurement of acoustic waves, seismic signals, and radio waves, and inspection of radioactive debris. The Soviet delegation expressed confidence in each method, while Western experts argued that a more comprehensive compliance system would be necessary.|$|E

5|$|Games in {{the series}} have been praised as being among the best modern {{role-playing}} games. Reviewers mostly aimed their praise <b>at</b> <b>particular</b> elements of the games: visual design, and its resemblance to Studio Ghibli's previous work; characters and story, for their believability and complexity; the soundtrack, and Hisaishi's ability to {{capture the essence of}} the game world; and the unique gameplay, particularly for its ability to blend formulas from other role-playing game franchises. The games also won awards from several gaming publications. In March 2014, Bandai Namco reported that the series had sold more than 1.7 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 {{more of the}} {{south-west}} corner {{collapsed and}} the castle's owner, Lord Hothfield, gave the property to the Office of Works. Work to stabilise the ruins was carried out and the castle, as a listed building and ancient monument, eventually passed into the control of English Heritage as a tourist attraction. There were initial archaeological excavations on the site in 1925, and then further work in 1970-71, 1993, 2007 and 2009. Erosion {{continues to be a}} threat to the castle's masonry, and as of 2010 English Heritage considered the castle's condition to be declining, with some parts <b>at</b> <b>particular</b> risk.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 and 1976, several {{stockholder}} lawsuits {{were filed}} against American Financial, and Keating was {{under fire for}} aspects involving unsecured loans, stock warrants, and {{the sale of the}} Enquirer. The Securities and Exchange Commission launched a major investigation of the company and charged Lindner, Keating and others with having defrauded investors and filing false SEC reports. <b>At</b> <b>particular</b> issue was a $14 million loan that the SEC said was made on preferential terms. Keating resigned from American Financial in August 1976, with conflicting stories {{as to whether or not}} Keating and Lindner had remained close or whether they had fallen out.|$|E

5|$|Adams still {{uses the}} same 26-inch-wide bass drum he began with in 1973. He has stated that he bought {{it as part of}} a set for $25 at a garage sale. It has the same head {{on the side of the}} drum that Adams does not beat, but Adams has stated that he replaces the other side about twice a year and also goes through about three sets of mallets each year. During games, Adams tends to drum <b>at</b> <b>particular</b> moments: when the Indians take the field at the {{beginning}} of the game, if the Indians have runners in scoring position, if the Indians are tied or trailing near the end of the game, or if they are winning at the top of the ninth inning. Because of his drumming, Adams became a celebrity and his drum was soon nicknamed Big Chief Boom-Boom, by Indians radio announcer Herb Score. It has also helped him meet politicians, including U.S. senators and a Pakistani government official.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{returning}} {{north in}} spring across the central Mediterranean appear {{to follow a}} well-defined route. Large concentrations of ruffs form every year <b>at</b> <b>particular</b> stopover sites to feed, and individuals marked with rings or dye reappear in subsequent years. The refuelling sites are closer together than the theoretical maximum travel distance calculated from the mean body mass, and provide evidence of a migration strategy using favoured intermediate sites. The ruff stores fat as a fuel, but unlike mammals, uses lipids as {{the main energy source}} for exercise (including migration) and, when necessary, keeps warm by shivering; however, little research has been conducted on the mechanisms by which they oxidise lipids.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{can occur}} by {{contaminated}} air, water, dust, food, or consumer products. Children are {{at greater risk}} as {{they are more likely to}} put objects in their mouth such as those that contain lead paint and absorb a greater proportion of the lead that they eat. Exposure at work is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations <b>at</b> <b>particular</b> risk. Diagnosis is typically by measurement of the blood lead level. The Centers for Disease Control (US) has set the upper limit for blood lead for adults at 10µg/dl (10µg/100 g) and for children at 5µg/dl. Elevated lead may also be detected by changes in red blood cells or dense lines in the bones of children as seen on X-ray.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the center of}} mass height is behind or below the line, such as on most tandem {{bicycles}} or long-wheel-base recumbent bicycles, as well as cars, it is less likely that the front wheel can generate enough braking force to flip the bike. This means they can decelerate up to nearly the limit of adhesion of the tires to the road, which could reach 0.8 g if the coefficient of friction is 0.8, which is 40% more than an upright bicycle under even the best conditions. Bicycling Science author David Gordon Wilson points out that this puts upright bicyclists <b>at</b> <b>particular</b> risk of causing a rear-end collision if they tailgate cars.|$|E
5|$|Progression through Paper Mario {{depends upon}} {{interaction}} with the game's non-player characters (NPCs), who will often offer clues or detail the next event in the storyline. As in other RPGs, the player can find or purchase items from NPCs to help in and outside of combat. Badges can also be obtained that yield bonuses ranging from added moves to gradual health restoration during combat; each consumes a set number of Badge Points (BP), meaning Mario can only equip {{a limited number of}} badges at a time. Princess Peach is playable <b>at</b> <b>particular</b> points in the game as a recurring sidequest. The objectives and actions of each transition to Peach vary, although most are stealth-based.|$|E
