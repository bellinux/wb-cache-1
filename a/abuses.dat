40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were to {{estimate}} the lifetime prevalence of physical, sexual, and psychological <b>abuse</b> in a random population-based sample of women aged 18 - 60 years; to estimate current suffering thereof; and to investigate associations between <b>abuse</b> and health problems, more specifically to study <b>abuse</b> related variables associated with somatization and PTSD, respectively. The studies had a cross-sectional design. Studies I and II comprised 4150 women 18 - 60 years. Study III included 547 women, and study IV consisted of 213 women, randomly selected from the population-based sample {{of the first two}} studies. The first study found lifetime prevalence rates of 19. 4 % for physical <b>abuse,</b> 9. 2 % for sexual <b>abuse,</b> and 18. 2 % for psychological <b>abuse.</b> <b>Abused</b> women reported more ill-health and a less advantageous social situation than non-abused women. There was an association between magnitude of <b>abuse</b> and health problems. Even a low magnitude of <b>abuse</b> was substantially associated with ill-health. In the second study we found that of the 27. 5 % of women who had reported any kind of <b>abuse</b> in the first study, 69. 5 % reported current suffering thereof. <b>Abused</b> suffering women reported more health problems than <b>abused</b> non-suffering women and non-abused women, and <b>abused</b> non-suffering women reported more health problems than non-abused women. In study three, psychological <b>abuse</b> and sexual <b>abuse</b> without penetration were found to be associated with somatization. Physical <b>abuse</b> and sexual <b>abuse</b> with penetration were not associated with somatization, when adjustments for other kinds of <b>abuse</b> were made. In study four, PTSD and somatization were found to be separately reported phenomena in <b>abused</b> women, although PTSD was positively associated with having somatic symptoms. Women with PTSD reported higher total magnitude of <b>abuse</b> and a higher number of perpetrators than women with somatization. Sexually <b>abused</b> women with PTSD more often described their experience as an act of <b>abuse</b> compared with sexually <b>abused</b> women with somatization. The present thesis demonstrates that even a low magnitude of <b>abuse</b> is associated with health problems. It also shows {{that a majority of the}} <b>abused</b> women, when investigating lifetime history of <b>abuse,</b> reported current suffering thereof, which warrants considering <b>abuse</b> an important societal problem. The relationship between somatization and posttraumatic stress in <b>abused</b> women is discussed in relation to <b>abuse</b> variables. Other factors than severity of <b>abuse,</b> such as whether the <b>abused</b> woman herself perceives her experience as <b>abuse,</b> seem to be more decisive for development of somatization in <b>abused</b> women. The findings suggest that PTSD is not a necessary mediator between <b>abuse</b> and somatization...|$|R

5|$|<b>Abuses</b> {{of power}} over the villagers by Abir had been {{reported}} by missionaries almost since they began operations in the Congo but the first real public disclosure came in 1901 {{with the publication of}} a report, written by an ex-agent, in several Belgian newspapers. The Free State began an investigation into Abir's <b>abuses</b> during which an inquiry established at Bongandanga heard evidence from missionaries in the concession. As a result, Abir took action against the missionaries, stopping the carriage of their mail on company steamers, stopping the missionaries' boats and confiscating any mail that they carried. Abir also forbid missionaries from buying food from villagers, forcing them to buy from Abir's own stores. In 1904 Roger Casement issued the Casement Report which condemned the Abir system; this resulted in the Free State launching another investigation later that year. Although evidence of unlawful killings made by Abir was uncovered the investigation had no powers of arrest and could only submit a report to the Free State authorities. This lack of action resulted in deteriorating relations between Abir and the missionaries and there was at least one attempted shooting of a missionary. Evidence for Abir's <b>abuses</b> also came from the governor of the French Congo, to the north-west, who claimed that prior to 1903 30,000 people had been driven from the Free State to the French Congo by Abir's actions.|$|E

Dan Healey shares his opinion that the <b>abuses</b> of Soviet psychiatry under Stalin and, even more dramatically, in the 1960s to 1980s remain under-researched: {{the contents of the}} main archives are still classified and inaccessible. Hundreds of files on people who underwent forensic psychiatric examinations at the Serbsky Institute during Stalin's time are on the shelves of the highly classified archive in its basement where Gluzman saw them in 1989.

40|$|Background <b>Abuse</b> {{of women}} occurs in every {{society of the}} world. Increased {{information}} about the prevalence in industrialized countries, like Norway, is required to make strategies to prevent <b>abuse.</b> Our aim {{was to investigate the}} prevalence of self-reported sexual, physical and emotional <b>abuse</b> in a large obstetric population in Norway, and the associations between exposure to adult <b>abuse,</b> socio-demographics and other characteristics. Methods Our study is based on the Norwegian Mother and Child (MoBa) Cohort study, conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. The current study included 65, 393 women who responded to two extensive postal questionnaires during pregnancy. Any adult <b>abuse</b> is defined as being exposed to one or more types of adult <b>abuse,</b> any child <b>abuse</b> is defined as being exposed to one or more types of child <b>abuse,</b> and any lifetime <b>abuse</b> is defined as being exposed to <b>abuse</b> either as a child and/or as an adult. Perpetrators were categorized as known or stranger. Results Overall, 32 % of the women reported any lifetime <b>abuse,</b> 20 % reported any adult <b>abuse,</b> 19 % reported any child <b>abuse</b> and 6 % reported <b>abuse</b> both as adults and as children. Emotional <b>abuse</b> was the most frequently reported type of <b>abuse</b> both as adults (16 %) and children (14 %). Adult sexual <b>abuse</b> was reported by 5 % and child sexual <b>abuse</b> by 7 %. Physical <b>abuse</b> was reported by 6 % as adults and by 6 % as children. Approximately 30 % of those reporting adult or child <b>abuse</b> reported exposure to two or three types of <b>abuse.</b> Five percent of the women reported exposure to any <b>abuse</b> during the last 12 [*]months. For all types of <b>abuse,</b> a known perpetrator was more commonly reported. Logistic regression showed that being exposed to child <b>abuse,</b> smoking and drinking alcohol in the first trimester of pregnancy, living alone, and belonging to the eldest age group were significantly associated with being exposed to any adult <b>abuse.</b> Conclusion The reported prevalence of any lifetime <b>abuse</b> was substantial in our low-risk pregnant population.

This study examines self-reported experiences of childhood traumatization in Hungarian inpatients with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and reveal which etiological factors are most strongly associated with the development of BPD. Methods: Traumatic childhood experiences of 80 borderline inpatients, 73 depressed inpatients and 51 healthy controls were assessed with the Traumatic Antecedents Questionnaire and the Sexual <b>Abuse</b> Scale of Early Trauma Inventory. Results: Adverse childhood experiences (neglect, emotional <b>abuse,</b> physical <b>abuse,</b> sexual <b>abuse,</b> witnessing trauma) were more prevalent among borderline patients than among depressed and healthy controls. Borderline patients reported severe sexual <b>abuse,</b> characterized by incest, penetration and repetitive <b>abuse.</b> Sexually <b>abused</b> borderline patients experienced more physical and emotional <b>abuse</b> than borderlines who were not sexually <b>abused.</b> The strongest predictors of borderline diagnosis were sexual <b>abuse,</b> intrafamilial physical <b>abuse</b> and neglect by the caretakers.
