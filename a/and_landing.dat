5|$|In development, {{significant}} {{attention was}} given to the Tornado's short-field take-off <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> (STOL) performance. Germany, in particular, encouraged this design aspect. For shorter take-off <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> distances, the Tornado can sweep its wings forwards to the 25-degree position, and deploy its full-span flaps and leading edge slats to allow the aircraft to fly at slower speeds. These features, in combination with the thrust reverser-equipped engines, give the Tornado excellent low-speed handling <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Korean War, {{a number}} of {{aircraft}} companies in both Europe and America separately decided to investigate the prospective of vertical take-off <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> (VTOL) aircraft, which would eliminate the requirement for vulnerable runways by taking off <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> vertically as opposed to the conventional horizontal approach. In addition to military applications, the prospect of applying such technology to commercial airliners was also viewed with considerable interest by the mid 1950s, thus the value of developing viable vertical take-off systems was judged to be substantial. However, even during this era, few companies had envisioned that a VTOL aircraft would also be realistically compatible with the characteristics of high performance military aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The Osprey is the world's first {{production}} tiltrotor aircraft, {{with one}} three-bladed proprotor, turboprop engine, and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip. It {{is classified as}} a powered lift aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration. For takeoff <b>and</b> <b>landing,</b> it typically operates as a helicopter with the nacelles vertical and rotors horizontal. Once airborne, the nacelles rotate forward 90° {{in as little as}} 12 seconds for horizontal flight, converting the V-22 to a more fuel-efficient, higher speed turboprop aircraft. STOL rolling-takeoff <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> capability is achieved by having the nacelles tilted forward up to 45°. Other orientations are possible. It has a ferry range of over 2,100 nmi. Its operational range is 1,100 nmi.|$|E

40|$|Hydrological <b>and</b> <b>land</b> use {{changes can}} affect species in human altered landscapes. Typically {{the impacts of}} {{hydrological}} <b>and</b> <b>land</b> use changes are examined separately, with hydrological determinants used to explain the distribution of species in water dependent and aquatic habitats <b>and</b> <b>land</b> use factors used to examine terrestrial species. However, given the connectedness of aquatic and terrestrial habitats, stressors originating in one domain may be important in the other. To explore the importance of integrating both hydrological <b>and</b> <b>land</b> use factors, we tested the relative contribution of hydrological factors <b>and</b> <b>land</b> use context as determinants of the dominant riparian tree species, Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehn. throughout wetlands of the Condamine catchment, southern Queensland, Australia. The occurrence of E. camaldulensis was modelled against hydrological <b>and</b> <b>land</b> use factors using generalized linear models (GLMs) and validated using internal bootstrapping procedures. Validated models which included both hydrological (distance from weir, wetland–river connectivity and groundwater depth) <b>and</b> <b>land</b> use factors (agricultural <b>land</b> cover <b>and</b> grazing intensity) performed better than those developed using only hydrological factors. The study results highlight the importance of an integrated perspective which considers both hydrological <b>and</b> <b>land</b> use factors {{in order to understand}} occurrence patterns of riparian and floodplain tree species in a range of settings. This approach could be especially important when assessing changes to hydrology <b>and</b> <b>land</b> use which may be triggered by climatic changes. ...|$|R
