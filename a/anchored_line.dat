Rotate the rod steadily into an upstream position, keeping your rod tip horizontal & low to the river surface and your right arm extended.3. The line, leader and fly will come upstream towards you, and the fly and leader should end up about a rod length away from your position, downstream {{and out into the}} river some. The tip of the rod is upstream of your position. 4. The rod tip is then swung out and around horizontally and quickly downstream, resulting in the line upstream of your position being gradually lifted or ripped from the water downstream, but not moving the 'anchored' position of the fly and leader; as you move the rod out and around downstream, the line follows the rod tip, and you will continue this rotation of the rod and lift the rod tip gradually as the rod tip passes your right shoulder, and the line will then follow to create the D loop downstream and behind your position; 5. Just as the creation of the D loop behind and downstream of your position is about the lift the <b>anchored</b> <b>line</b> tip, leader & fly, begin the forward casting stroke to launch the line, leader & fly in the direction opposite (180 degrees around) the D loop, and in the direction of your target across the river.|$|E
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the technological feasibility of seaweed cultivation in the North Sea {{in combination with}} offshore wind parks and harvesting and conversion of seaweed biomass to renewable energy carriers and chemicals. The study also identifies stakeholders and participants for technology development and the ecological and societal conditions to fit in large-scale seaweed cultivation in the marine environment, existing marine infrastructure and functions, and (inter) national regulations and policies for the North Sea. Three seaweed species that are native in the North Sea have been selected for potential cultivation: Ulva sp. (belonging to the green macroalgae), Laminaria sp. (a brown macroalga) and Palmaria sp. (a red macroalga). Current commercial seaweed cultivation systems usually consist of (partly) <b>anchored</b> <b>line</b> structures to which the seaweeds are attached and are generally located on coastal locations. International research shows that cultivation systems in the open sea may become easily damaged by wind and wave action. An experimental ring shaped system has thus far shown the best stability for the conditions in the North Sea. However the production costs are high. Considerable system development is therefore required to enable large-scale, economically attractive cultivation of seaweeds combined with offshore wind parks. The optimal system design is unknown. This study proposes a layered system for seaweed cultivation employing the typical light absorption characteristics of green, brown and red macroalgae respectively, to enable optimal use of the available sunlight and enhance areal productivity. Without addition of nutrients the productivity in the North Sea is estimated at approx. 20 tons dry matter/ha. year. Through layered cultivation and/or addition of nutrients this can potentially be increased to ca. 50 tons dry weight /ha. year. Development of precision nutrient dosage technology is required to prevent eutrophication. Potential negative environmental impacts include: sedimentation of seaweed fragments and other organics with {{a negative effect on}} the oxygen budget in the water column, and possible negative impacts on migration of sea mammals including dolphins, porpoises and whales. Seaweed cultivation can also have positive impacts including the uptake of nutrients by the macroalgae (reducing eutrophication) and an enhancement of marine biodiversity, because the seaweeds and the cultivation systems offer substrate for attachment, shelter and feed for molluscs and fish. Indeed, the system could be managed as a nursery for young fish in order to restore fish populations in the North Sea. Integration of seaweed cultivation with other types of aquaculture e. g. cultivation of mussels or fish is a realistic option. The Dutch government target for offshore wind in 2020 is 6. 000 MW installed turbine capacity. This will involve a surface area of approx. 1000 km 2. The support constructions for the wind turbines can serve as a structural basis for seaweed cultivation systems. Designs must take into account the additional load on the turbine supports due to currents, wind and wave action, and accessibility of the turbines for maintenance vessels. Potential synergistic effects of the combination of offshore wind and seaweed cultivation supporting the profitability of both activities include joint management and maintenance, alternative employment opportunities for fisheries and ecological benefit...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Potato {{varieties}} {{characterized by}} non-conventional skin and flesh colors (purple, red, yellow) {{have the potential}} to revitalize consumer demand for fresh market potatoes because of their unique appearance and health benefits. Red and purple potatoes contain anthocyanins, which are flavonoids responsible for red, blue, and purple pigments in plants. Yellow potatoes contain carotenoids, which are xanthophylls responsible for orange and yellow pigments in plants. Both anthocyanins and carotenoids are antioxidants that benefit human health. The objective of this thesis research was to investigate consumer acceptance of colorful fresh market potato varieties and to understand the effect of health information on purchase intent. This thesis research was divided into three studies, preceded by a literature review. The literature review summarized research linking raw tuber characteristics to the culinary quality of fresh market potatoes. Specific compounds, genes, and processes affecting potato appearance, flavor, and texture were reviewed. In the first study, consumer attitudes and opinions about colorful fresh market potatoes were investigated using four focus group sessions with a total of 37 participants. Five colorful potato varieties were shown to participants. Purchase intent for each variety was marked on an <b>anchored</b> <b>line</b> scale after: 1) seeing and handling the raw uncut potato, 2) seeing a photo of the raw potato cut in half, 3) seeing a photo of the potato cooked (boiled) and cut in half, and 4) after receiving health information describing antioxidant benefits. Reactions to colorful potato varieties were mixed. Health information had a greater impact on purchase intent than the photos of the raw and cooked potatoes. Purchase intent was also influenced by positive and negative associations with appearance, concerns about genetic engineering, tampering, and chemicals, preparation and presentation considerations, point of sale, family acceptance, and anticipated flavor. In the second study, a consumer acceptance test with 222 participants evaluated six colorful fresh market potato varieties alongside a commonly available variety, the Yukon Gold. Participants rated liking of overall appearance, color, size, and shape for raw uncut potatoes on a 9 -point category scale. Participants tasted the potatoes boiled and rated liking of cooked appearance, flavor, and texture on a 9 -point category scale. Participant comments describing what they liked and/or disliked about each raw and cooked potato were also captured. For color, yellow and red varieties were accepted over purple varieties. For shape and size, large and round varieties were accepted over small, elongated varieties. Bimodal hedonic score distributions were observed for purple color, small size, and elongated shape. Consumer comments revealed that a uniform raw and cooked appearance, a distinct flavor with no undesirable aftertaste, and a smooth, firm, and consistent texture were all desirable characteristics. In the third study, the effect of health information on purchase intent for colorful fresh market potatoes was investigated. Participants either received no information, a simple statement, or a detailed statement about antioxidants in colorful potatoes. After reading the information, participants rated purchase intent on a 5 -point category scale at a low, medium, and high price. The effect of antioxidant information on the probability of purchase for red and purple potatoes was compared to yellow potatoes. The impact of hedonic rating, price, gender, age, education, income, usage frequency, health interest, food interest, and antioxidant knowledge were also investigated. High hedonic ratings and interest in food had a positive effect on purchase intent for all potatoes. High price had a negative effect on purchase intent for all potatoes. Antioxidant information and interest in health had a positive effect on purchase intent for red and purple potatoes. Age had a negative effect on purchase intent for red and purple potatoes. An advanced degree of education had a negative effect on purchase intent for yellow potatoes...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{conventional}} knowledge {{for as long}} as ships have existed that the catenary effect of an <b>anchor</b> <b>line</b> augments the efficiency of an anchoring system. This is achieved by making the <b>anchor</b> <b>line</b> as heavy as possible thus lowering the effective angle of pull on the anchor. This notion has, however, come under criticism in recent times. Many small boat owners have shifted to lighter tauter <b>lines</b> for <b>anchoring.</b> The argument in favor of this new method is the cost savings associated with lighter anchoring and the tension relief that comes with using lighter and more elastic <b>anchor</b> <b>lines.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to therefore compare the performance of long slack lines that form catenary shapes with that of shorter taut lines. An analysis is presented that describes the surge motion of a small anchored boat exposed to an input forcing function and various retarding forces and effects. The anchoring system used in the analytical model results in a non-linear but symmetrical restoring force, which resists the force-induced motion of the boat. Two main types of <b>anchor</b> <b>lines</b> are considered: uniform-material and two-material <b>anchor</b> <b>lines.</b> Each <b>anchor</b> <b>line</b> is evaluated both in catenary configuration and taut configuration in terms of its ability to minimize the motions of the boat and tension force in the <b>anchor</b> <b>line</b> due to wind disturbances. by Jessy Mbagara Mwarage.
