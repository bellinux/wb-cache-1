5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{the company had}} sold all its hotel operations. The merged company {{retained}} the obligation to operate dining services on the trains, which throughout the 1980s necessitated considerable subsidies from NSB. In 1988, NSB decided to organize {{the operation of the}} dining services through tendered contracts; the first contract (from 1990 through 1995) was won by TogService, a Narvesen subsidiary. The owners had an agreement that neither could sell without the approval of the other. In 1995 NSB sold its shares with Fritt Ord's <b>approval,</b> <b>and</b> the company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.|$|E
5|$|COMIGAL {{dispatched}} inspection teams throughout South Vietnam {{to identify}} {{areas that were}} suitable for accommodating the new arrivals according to their professional skills. This required a search for arable land for farmers, favourable coastal areas for fishing and areas near large population centres for industrially oriented arrivals. Having identified the relevant areas, COMIGAL would set up plans for settlement subprojects, sending proposals to the USOM or the French Technical and Economic Cooperation Bureau to gain <b>approval</b> <b>and</b> funding. The bureaucracy was relatively low, with most applications taking less than a fortnight for finalising paperwork and receiving approval. Each subproject was given a nine-month deadline for completion.|$|E

5|$|Even so, churches {{within the}} Assemblies of God have {{experienced}} revivals {{in the last}} two decades which featured worship and practices reminiscent of early Pentecostalism. The most prominent of these was the Brownsville Revival, which occurred at the Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Florida, from 1995 into the early 2000s. These revivals often faced criticism from within and without the Assemblies of God for their unpredictability and the dramatic religious experiences of participants. In the case of the Brownsville Revival, the AG's national leadership gave it cautious <b>approval</b> <b>and</b> support.|$|E
5|$|For Kant a {{good will}} is a broader {{conception}} than a will which acts from duty. A will which acts from duty is distinguishable as a will which overcomes hindrances {{in order to}} keep the moral law. A dutiful will is thus a special case of a good will which becomes visible in adverse conditions. Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth. This is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve <b>approval</b> <b>and</b> encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.|$|E
5|$|In a 2005 Canadian dispute, Rogers Media and Newcap Broadcasting {{maintained}} a joint sales agreement pertaining to CHNO-FM in Sudbury, Ontario, but community {{interests and the}} lobby group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting presented substantial evidence to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission that in practice, the agreement was a de facto LMA, going significantly beyond advertising sales into program production and news-gathering. LMAs in Canada cannot be implemented without the CRTC's <b>approval,</b> <b>and</b> in early 2005, the CRTC ordered the agreement to cease.|$|E

Despite Rice's own overwhelming <b>approval</b> <b>and</b> praise, the show received disappointing attendance and largely negative reviews from critics. Lestat closed a month later on May 28, 2006, after just 33 previews and 39 regular performances. The release of the cast recording {{of the show is}} reportedly on hold indefinitely.|$|E

In the early 1870s, he decided to build a light railway to transport freight from his estates in Buckinghamshire to the A's line at Quainton Road. As the proposed line was to run on land owned by the Duke and by the Winwood Charity Trust, who consented to its construction, the line did not need Parliamentary <b>approval</b> <b>and</b> construction could begin immediately.|$|E

The colony tried to contribute to area culture by requiring its members to hold art shows, lectures, and other exhibitions throughout the early 20th century.
