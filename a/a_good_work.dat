5|$|Milne was {{naturally}} right-footed, though trained {{hard with}} his left foot as a boy to become equally skilled with both feet. Former Dundee United teammate Paul Hegarty stated that Milne possessed great pace, as well as bravery, <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>work</b> ethic, {{and an ability to}} score important goals. Another former Dundee United teammate, Davie Dodds, said that Milne was as good a finisher as any player in Scottish football during the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Barton {{has been}} {{described}} as having <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>work</b> ethic and the ability to carry the ball and retain possession for the team. He has been praised for having a good passing range. This aspect of his game has shown improvement since the 2005–06 season, when he began to favour simpler passes over more ambitious ones, and his relatively high pass completion rate can be attributed to this change. Barton's passes have often proved to be crucial; in the past he has led the way in his team's assists.|$|E
5|$|The {{title was}} won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona. However, three {{goals in the}} last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003. The first goal came from José Antonio Reyes, who scored after <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>work</b> from Gonzalo Higuaín. An own goal {{followed}} by another goal from Reyes allowed Real to begin celebrating the title. Thousands of Real Madrid fans began going to Plaza de Cibeles to celebrate the title.|$|E

[...] Common working roles for Labradors include: hunting, tracking and detection (they {{have a great}} sense of smell which helps when working in these areas), disabled-assistance, carting, and therapy work. Approximately 60–70% of all guide dogs in Canada are Labradors; other common breeds are Golden Retrievers and German Shepherds.|$|E
500|$|In his [...] "Essay on the Poor Law," [...] Locke {{turns to}} the {{education}} of the poor; he laments that [...] "the children of labouring people are an ordinary burden to the parish, and are usually maintained in idleness, so that their labour also is generally lost to the public till they are 12 or 14 years old." [...] He suggests, therefore, that [...] "working schools" [...] be set up in each parish in England for poor children so that they will be [...] "from infancy [...] inured to work." [...] He goes on to outline the economics of these schools, arguing not only that they will be profitable for the parish, but also that they will instill <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>work</b> ethic in the children.|$|E
2500|$|The {{evaluation}} {{concludes with}} the auditor determining, {{based on the}} evaluation, whether the recipient is a high-risk auditee or a low-risk auditee. A high-risk auditee is a recipient which has {{a high risk of}} not complying with federal laws and regulations, while a low-risk auditee is the exact opposite. For example, an auditor may judge a recipient to be a high-risk auditee because the audit reports {{of the past few years}} have numerous audit findings (e.g. specific situations of non-compliance with laws and regulations, serious deficiencies in internal controls and/or acts of fraud), or because the auditor receives news from various sources that the recipient is engaged in illegal activities, such as money laundering. On the other hand, the auditor may determine that a recipient is low-risk because its management personnel have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>work</b> ethic, the auditor has received good references from external sources, or because the recipient has never received any audit findings. However, the OMB Circular A-133 has set certain requirements a recipient must meet to be considered a low-risk recipient. This includes the following: ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{the album}} was finished, its final {{production}} cost had reached around £25,000. Wakeman described working on it as [...] "difficult and cumbersome", but said the project was eventually a rewarding one. He was excited {{when it came to}} presenting the album to A management at their London office, which included a lawyer who represented the label's US division. After {{the album was}} played in the office, Wakeman [...] "sensed that something was not right in the room. There was pretty much silence as it finished". The lawyer thought it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>work</b> in progress and looked forward to hearing vocals added to the music, yet Wakeman explained that he wished to produce an instrumental keyboard album. To make matters worse, Wakeman recalled the head of the label's UK division felt the album would be too difficult to sell, and another attendee estimated that around 50,000 copies had to be sold to become profitable. With little faith in the album, A pressed an initial 12,500 copies in hope of earning back their money. Wakeman summarised: [...] "I was absolutely deflated". The album's cover photograph was taken at the Madame Tussauds wax museum in London, where a figure of Richard Nixon {{can be seen in the}} background as the curtain was not fully closed.|$|E
2500|$|An {{examination}} of John's Gospel makes {{it almost impossible}} to deny the identity of Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalen. From John we learn the name of the [...] "woman" [...] who anointed Christ's feet previous to the last supper. We may remark here that it seems unnecessary to hold that because Matthew and Mark say [...] "two days before the Passover", while John says [...] "six days" [...] there were, therefore, two distinct anointings following one another. John {{does not necessarily mean that}} the supper and the anointing took place six days before, but only that Christ came to Bethany six days before the Passover. At that supper, then, Mary received the glorious encomium, [...] "she hath wrought <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>work</b> upon Me...in pouring this ointment upon My body she hath done it for My burial...wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached...that also which she hath done shall be told for a memory of her." [...] Is it credible, in view of all this, that this Mary should have no place at the foot of the cross, nor at the tomb of Christ? Yet it is Mary Magdalen who, according to all the Evangelists, stood at the foot of the cross and assisted at the entombment and was the first recorded witness of the Resurrection. And while John calls her [...] "Mary Magdalen" [...] in 19:25, 20:1, and 20:18, he calls her simply [...] "Mary" [...] in 20:11 and 20:16.|$|E
2500|$|Purification, which grounds Christian {{spirituality in}} general, is {{primarily}} focused on efforts to, {{in the words}} of St. Paul, [...] "put to death the deeds of the flesh by the Holy Spirit" [...] (Romans 8:13). This is considered a result of the Spirit working in the person and is not a result of personal deeds. Also {{in the words of}} St. Paul, [...] "...he who began <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>work</b> in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus." [...] (Epistle to the Philippians 1:6). The [...] "deeds of the flesh" [...] here include not only external behavior, but also those habits, attitudes, compulsions, addictions, etc. (sometimes called egoic passions) which oppose themselves to true being and living as a Christian not only exteriorly, but interiorly as well. Evelyn Underhill describes purification as an awareness of one's own imperfections and finiteness, followed by [...] self-discipline and mortification. Because of its physical, disciplinary aspect, this phase, as well as the entire Christian spiritual path, {{is often referred to as}} [...] "ascetic," [...] a term which is derived from a Greek word which connotes athletic training. Because of this, in ancient Christian literature, prominent mystics are often called [...] "spiritual athletes," [...] an image which is also used several times in the New Testament to describe the Christian life. [...] What is sought here is salvation in the original sense of the word, referring not only to one's eternal fate, but also to healing in all areas of life, including the restoration of spiritual, psychological, and physical health.|$|E
