40|$|The River Protection Project-Waste Treatment Plant (RPP-WTP) {{requested}} Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{to conduct}} small-scale foaming and <b>antifoam</b> testing using a Hanford waste simulant subjected to air sparging during oxidative leaching. The foaminess of Hanford tank waste solutions was previously demonstrated by SRNL during WTP evaporator foaming studies and in small scale air sparger studies. The commercial <b>antifoam,</b> Dow Corning Q 2 - 3183 A was recommended {{to mitigate the}} foam in the evaporators and in vessel equipped with pulse jet mixers and air spargers. Currently, WTP is planning to use air spargers in the HLW Lag Storage Vessels (HLP-VSL- 00027 A/B), the Ultrafiltration Vessels (UFP-VSL- 00002 A&B), and the HLW Feed Blend Vessel (HLPVSL- 00028) to assist {{the performance of the}} Pulse Jet Mixers (PJM).

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) at the Savannah River Site is {{responsible}} for immobilizing high level radioactive waste (HLW) as glass-filled steel canisters for permanent storage. In the DWPF facility, the HLW sludge undergoes chemical treatment to prepare it for vitrification in a melter. The generation of stable foams is possible during treatment. The current DWPF <b>antifoam</b> is ineffective in preventing and minimizing the formation of foam. The adverse consequences of excess foam can be severe enough to cause foam to exit the evaporator and collect in the condensate. A foamover will contaminate the relatively clean condensate with HLW solids. It can also potentially lead {{to the production of}} an unsuitable melter feed that would not make quality glass. Both of these consequences are costly and time consuming to correct. A new <b>antifoam</b> agent was developed by the Illinois Institute of Technology, IIT, for DWPF in an attempt to minimize or eliminate the frequency of these foamovers. This <b>antifoam</b> agent was demonstrated to be superior to the existing DWPF <b>antifoam</b> agent in laboratory scale experiments. However, the DWPF evaporation heat flux was not achievable in the laboratory scale equipment. A 1 / 240 th-scale pilot facility was built to achieve this heat flux and determine whether the existing or new <b>antifoam</b> agent was superior. The pilot facility was built out of glass to allow observation of the foam formation during processing. The experiments used a non-radioactive simulant slurry similar to HLW. The IIT <b>antifoam</b> agent was found to be much more effective than the DWPF <b>antifoam</b> at the current conditions of maximum foam formation. The IIT <b>antifoam</b> agent was comparable or superior to the present DWPF <b>antifoam</b> under all conditions tested.

40|$|The <b>antifoam</b> agent DOW Corning Q 2 - 3183 A will {{be added}} to waste streams in the Hanford River Protection Program-Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (RPP-WTP) to prevent foaming. It {{consists}} mostly of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polypropylene glycol (PPG). These and other minor constituents of the <b>antifoam</b> have organic constituents that may participate in radiolytic and chemical reactions that produce hydrogen in Hanford waste. It has been recommended by The WTP R&T Department recommended personnel to treat the organic compounds of the <b>antifoam</b> like the in a similar manner as other organic compounds that are native to the Hanford waste with respect to hydrogen production. This testing has investigated the radiolytic and thermal production of hydrogen from <b>antifoam</b> added to simulant waste solutions to determine if the organic components of the <b>antifoam</b> produce hydrogen {{in the same manner as}} the native organic species in Hanford waste. <b>Antifoam</b> additions for this testing were in the range of 4 to 10 wt% to ensure adequate hydrogen detection. Test conditions were selected to bound exposures to the <b>antifoam</b> agent in the WTP. These levels are higher than previously recommended values of 350 mg/L for actual applications in WTP tanks containing air spargers and pulse jet mixers. Limited degradation analyses for the organic components of the <b>antifoam</b> were investigated in this study. A more detailed study involving analyses of <b>antifoam</b> degradation and product formation is in progress at SRNL and results from that study will be reported at a later time. The total organic carbon (TOC) content of the Q 2 - 3183 A <b>antifoam</b> was measured to be 39. 7 {+-} 4. 9 wt% TOC. This measurement was performed in triplicate with on three different dilutions of the pure <b>antifoam</b> liquid using a TOC combustion analyzer instrument with catalytic oxidation, followed by CO{sub 2 } quantification using an infrared detector. Test results from this study indicate that the WTP HGR correlation conservatively bounds hydrogen generation rates (HGRs) from antifoam-containing simulants if the <b>antifoam</b> organic components are treated the same as other native organics. Tests that used the combination of radiolysis and thermolysis conducted on simulants containing <b>antifoam</b> produced measured hydrogen that was bounded by the WTP correlation. These tests used the bounding WTP temperature of 90 C and a dose rate of 1. 8 x 10 {sup 5 } rad/hr. This dose rate is about ten times higher than the dose rate equivalent calculated for a bounding Hanford sludge slurry composition of 10 Ci/L, or 2 x 10 {sup 4 } rad/hr. Hydrogen was measured using a quadrupole mass spectroscopy instrument. Based on the analyses from the 4 wt% and 10 wt% <b>antifoam</b> samples, it is expected that the HGR results are directly proportional to the <b>antifoam</b> concentration added. A native organic-containing simulant that did not contain any added <b>antifoam</b> also produced a measurable radiolytic/thermal hydrogen rates that was in bounded by the WTP correlation. A base simulant with no added organic produced a measurable radiolytic/thermal HGR that was {approx} 2 X higher than the predicted HGR. Analysis of antifoam-containing simulants after prolonged irradiation of 52 Mrad and heating (23 days at 90 C) indicates that essentially all of the PDMS and greater than 60 % of the PPG components are degraded, likely to lower molecular weight species. The <b>antifoam</b> components were analyzed by extraction from the salt simulants, followed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) by personnel at Dow Corning. A more detailed study of the <b>antifoam</b> degradation and product formation from radiolysis and thermolysis is currently in progress at SRNL. That study uses a dose rate of about 2 x 10 {sup 4 } rad/hr and bounding temperatures of 90 C. Results from that study will be reported in a future report...|$|R

The <b>antifoam</b> was further tested using simulated Hanford tank waste spiked with <b>antifoam</b> that was heated and irradiated (2. 1 x 10 {sup 4 } rad/h) at conditions (90 C, 3 M NaOH, 8 h) expected in the processing of radioactive waste through the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) at Hanford. After irradiation, the concentration of the major polymer components polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polypropylene glycol (PPG) in the <b>antifoam</b> was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). No loss of the major polymer components was observed after 24 h and only 15 wt% loss of PDMS was reported after 48 h. The presence of degradation products were not observed by gas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) or high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS).

These properties were deduced from the acoustic sound measurement. The study revealed that the addition of <b>antifoam</b> chemicals reduces the overall gas holdup and increases the average bubble diameter.

40|$|<b>Antifoams</b> {{are widely}} used {{for control of the}} foam {{stability}} in various products (detergents, paints, pharmaceuticals, and many others). A significant progress in the understanding of the foam destruction mechanisms by oil-containing <b>antifoams</b> has been achieved recently. Experiments with <b>antifoams</b> comprising silicone oil and hydrophobic silica showed that the <b>antifoam</b> entities (emulsified globules or lenses floating on the solution surface) easily form unstable oil bridges between the two surfaces of the foam film. These bridges rapidly stretch in radial direction, due to uncompensated capillary pressures at the oil-water and oil-air interfaces, and eventually rupture the foam films. As a result, the foam is destroyed within several seconds by the mixed solid-liquid <b>antifoams.</b> In contrast, drops of silicone oil deprived of silica are unable to enter the foam film surface due to significant entry barriers. In these systems, the oil drops are expelled into the neighbouring Plateau borders (PBs), and the foam collapse is observed at a much later stage of the foam evolution, when the drops are compressed by the walls of the narrowing PBs (defoaming time on the order of minutes and hours). The magnitude of the entry barriers can be quantified by the so called Film Trappin...|$|R
