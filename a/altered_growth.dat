50|$|The {{spilling}} {{of petroleum}} into our natural waterways {{is a major}} issue, and petroleum causes both acute and long term issues. Oil is harvested and processed in so many ways, {{there is a lot}} of room for error. These spills can be caused by tankers, refineries, drilling operations, or even storage facilities. Regardless of how petroleum is released into nature, spills account for high percentages of marine death and complicate vegetative life. When oil leaks into an ecosystem, it alters the balance of both the habitat and the organisms that live there. These organisms experience <b>altered</b> <b>growth</b> and reproduction patterns, anatomical complications, and increased susceptibility to hypothermia. The water resistant properties of birds and mammals are compromised due to matting of fur and exposed skin.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, {{there was}} a study that U.S Navy has found {{elevated}} levels of toxic chemicals in the carcasses and food of endangered birds at the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge. The elevated levels of cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel and zinc, all poisonous heavy metals, were found in dead California least terns and light-footed clapper rails. However, these potentially toxic substances were not only found in the birds, but also found in smaller animals normally eaten by them. They also found small amounts of PCBs and DDT, a dangerous pesticide that was banned by the Endangered Species Act in 1973. To find the cause, the Navy assessed the impacts of ponds on the refuge on the birds. They found that {{there was a}} construction of the pond by the Port of Long Beach that has raised the volume and velocity of the bay water flowing into the refuge. The toxic materials affect the birds with <b>altered</b> <b>growth</b> patterns, reduced survival, loss of appetite, lethargy, difficulty in reproducing, and even killing the birds.|$|E
50|$|Oil {{pollution}} toxicity to marine fish {{has been}} observed from oil spills such as the Exxon Valdez disaster, and from nonpoint sources, such as surface runoff, {{which is the largest}} source of oil pollution in marine waters. Crude oil entering waterways from spills or runoff contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most toxic components of oil. The route of PAH uptake into fish depends on many environmental factors and the properties of the PAH. The common routes are ingestion, ventilation of the gills, and dermal uptake. Fish exposed to these PAHs exhibit an array of toxic effects including genetic damage, morphological deformities, <b>altered</b> <b>growth</b> and development, decreased body size, inhibited swimming abilities and mortality. The morphological deformities of PAH exposure, such as fin and jaw malformations, result in significantly reduced survival in fish due to the reduction of swimming and feeding abilities. While the exact mechanism of PAH toxicity is unknown, there are four proposed mechanisms. The difficulty in finding a specific toxic mechanism is largely due to the wide variety of PAH compounds with differing properties.|$|E

Although pruning infected stems from the tree may lower the initial inoculum, it provided little benefit to lesioned branches as they often die. The best time to prune is during the late dormant seasons like winter when insects and infections are less likely. For infections during warmer weathered seasons, apply If left untouched, branches with galls will eventually become necrotic. Infected tissue {{that has not been}} removed will continue to sporulate until the host tissue has dried out. There is also some evidence that rodents strip the wood from galls, but it is uncommon to see this result in further spread of the disease or death of the gall. Insects frequently associate with the gall rust as well. Some feed on the aeciospores and can negatively impact the fungus’ survival while other insects, like the red turpentine beetle, can carry spores to other trees. Large populations of the beneficial insects in the environment could potentially aid in suppressing a large outbreak of pine-pine gall rust.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is {{produced}} in high amounts by normal and malignant prostate cancer cells. PSA is a serine protease with substrates that include semenogelin I and II, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, fibronectin, and laminin. PSA, via its enzymatic activity, {{may play a role}} in growth, invasion, and metastasis of prostate cancer cells. Recent data also suggest that the PSA protein itself, independent of enzymatic activity, may also function as an endothelial cell-specific inhibitor of angiogenesis. METHODS: Human (PC 3, DU 145) and rat (AT 2, AT 6) prostate cancer cell lines were transfected with the full PSA gene encoding preproPSA protein. PSA-producing clones of each cell line were selected and the amount of enzymatically active PSA produced by each cell line determined using a PSA-specific fluorescent peptide substrate. In vitro and in vivo growth characteristics of PSA-producing transfectants were compared to neomycin controls and wild type cells. RESULTS: All selected clones produced and secreted PSA (5 - 120 ng/ml/ 10 (5) cells). None of the PSA-transfected cell lines produced detectable amounts of enzymatically active PSA. Production of enzymatically inactive PSA by prostate cancer cell lines did not <b>alter</b> <b>growth</b> kinetics in vitro. PSA-producing xenograft doubling times in vivo were similar to neomycin controls and wild type. CONCLUSION: Although recent reports suggest the PSA protein itself may be antiangiogenic, our results demonstrate that production of PSA protein by prostate cancer cells does not significantly <b>alter</b> <b>growth</b> in vitro or in vivo...|$|R

40|$|We {{found that}} {{mitochondrial}} alternative oxidase (AOX) protein {{and the capacity}} for CN-resistant respiration are dramatically increased in wild-type tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) suspension-cultured cells in response to growth under P limitation, and antisense (AS 8) tobacco cells unable to induce AOX under these conditions have <b>altered</b> <b>growth</b> and metabolism. Specifically, {{we found that the}} respiration of AS 8 cells was restricted during P-limited growth, when the potential for severe adenylate control of respiration (at the level of C supply to the mitochondrion and/or at the level of oxidative phosphorylation) is high due to the low cellular levels of ADP and/or inorganic P. As a result of this respiratory restriction, AS 8 cells had <b>altered</b> <b>growth,</b> morphology, cellular composition, and patterns of respiratory C flow to amino acid synthesis compared with wild-type cells with abundant AOX protein. Also, AS 8 cells under P limitation displayed high in vivo rates of generation of active oxygen species compared with wild-type cells. This difference could be abolished by an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Our results suggest that induction of non-phosphorylating AOX respiration (like induction of adenylate and inorganic P-independent pathways in glycolysis) is an important plant metabolic adaptation to P limitation. By preventing severe respiratory restriction, AOX acts to prevent both redirections in C metabolism and the excessive generation of harmful active oxygen species in the mitochondrion...|$|E
