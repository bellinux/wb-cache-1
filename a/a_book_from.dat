5|$|Misaki is Asuma's {{assistant}} {{and is the}} first person that Hibiki meets from Kamisaid Magic Academy. When Hibiki makes a mistake, Misaki lectures her and informs her how {{a member of the}} faculty should act, even when it may not entirely be her fault. Due to Hibiki's low magical experience, Misaki worries about Hibiki succeeding {{as a member of the}} staff. Like Hibiki, Misaki cannot perform magic, though she still has a vast knowledge of magic at her disposal. She had been adopted by a man that constantly abused her and the only thing that could cheer her up was <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>from</b> a magic user. She had been saved by Asuma and hopes to be of use to him.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{schoolchildren}} tell Bellman {{jokes about}} a person named Bellman, an antihero or modern-day trickster {{with little or no}} connection to the poet. The first known Bellman joke is in <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>from</b> 1835, which quoted a letter written in 1808 by a contemporary of Bellman. 19th century Bellman jokes were told by adults and focused on Bellman's life at court; they often related to sex. In the 20th century, the 'Bellman' character became generic, the jokes were told by schoolchildren, and often related to bodily functions. The jokes have been studied by anthropologists and psychologists since the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|Exactly how, when, or why Harry Nyquist had {{his name}} {{attached}} to the sampling theorem remains obscure. The term Nyquist Sampling Theorem (capitalized thus) appeared as early as 1959 in <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>from</b> his former employer, Bell Labs, and appeared again in 1963, and not capitalized in 1965. It had been called the Shannon Sampling Theorem as early as 1954, but also just the sampling theorem by several other books in the early 1950s.|$|E

25|$|His renown as an {{architect}} even reached the court of the Archduke Albert and Infanta Isabella, governors of the Southern Netherlands. In 1601 {{he was invited to}} Brussels to present himself at the court, arriving in September of that year. When his in-laws died in 1603, he had to return to Rome to settle family matters. On his return in 1604, he brought along <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>from</b> Cardinal Baronius for the printshop of Christoffel Plantijn. He settled in Antwerp where he was admitted as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke. In 1605 he was admitted in the Guild of Romanists.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, a janitor, who {{was also}} a student, {{borrowed}} <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>from</b> the library, to read during breaks. The book was Notre Dame vs the Klan, a historical account of how the then-despised Catholic minority in 1924, confronted the then-powerful Ku Klux Klan. The book jacket portrayed the hooded Klansmen. A co-worker complained after seeing the cover, as did his union supervisor. Eventually the school's Affirmative Action Officer issued a formal rebuke to the janitor. After much discussion and criticism she backed away from that rebuke and subsequently retired. After more criticism and a passage of several months, the university chancellor apologized and issued letters of disapproval to the original complainant.|$|E

His diaries, which he began in 1971, were published posthumously by his close friend Lady Henrietta Rous in 1998 as The Ossie Clark Diaries.

25|$|Over {{the next}} decade or so, he {{published}} regularly in the University Review (later known as the Irish University Review), a relationship that culminated in the 1975 special issue. This featured an introduction by Dr. J. C. C. Mays, a selection of translations from the French, the satire Leo and Advent, a meditation on death inspired {{by the death of}} the poet's son in a motorcycle accident. The poem is in seven sections, based, according to Coffey in an interview with Parkman Howe, on the canonical hours of the Catholic Church. Another key work of this period was Death of Hektor, which uses the myth of Troy as a framework for a meditation on war and its victims. The trade editions of Advent and Death of Hektor were both published by the Menard Press. He also edited Devlin's Collected Poems, first for a University Review Devlin special issue and later as <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>from</b> Dolmen Press.|$|E
25|$|Bookbinding is {{the process}} of {{physically}} assembling <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>from</b> an ordered stack of paper sheets that are folded together into sections or sometimes left as a stack of individual sheets. The stack is then bound together along one edge by either sewing with thread through the folds or by a layer of flexible adhesive. Alternative methods to binding a stack together that are cheaper but less permanent include loose-leaf rings, individual screw posts or binding posts, twin loop spine coils, plastic spiral coils, and plastic spine combs. For protection, the bound stack is either wrapped in a flexible cover or attached to stiff boards. Finally, an attractive cover is adhered to the boards and a label with identifying information is attached to the covers along with additional decoration. Book artists or specialists in book decoration can greatly expand the previous explanation to include book like objects of visual art with high value and artistic merit of exceptional quality in addition to the book's content of text and illustrations.|$|E

500|$|The flag {{should never}} be depicted, {{displayed}} or flown upside down. Tradition also states that when draped vertically, the flag should not merely be rotated 90degrees, but also reversed.

500|$|There are 66 {{letters to}} the lawyer Daines Barrington [...] (1727–1800), occupying half the book. Letter 1, on summer birds of passage, is dated 30 June 1769; Letter 66, on thunderstorms, is dated 25 June 1787. The Barrington letters {{therefore}} largely overlap the time frame of those to Pennant, but began and ended somewhat later. It was Barrington who suggested to White that he should write <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>from</b> his observations; although Pennant had been corresponding with White for a while, he was relying on White for natural history information for his own books, and, suggests White's biographer Richard Mabey, must have wanted White as a continuing source of information, not as a rival author. Barrington, on the other hand, liked to theorize about the natural world, but {{had little interest in}} making observations himself, and tended to accept claimed facts uncritically.|$|E
500|$|Many {{successful}} Chinese students after Liu {{have tried}} {{to distance themselves from}} the so-called [...] "Harvard Girl Phenomenon;" [...] Harvard students Yin Zhongrui and Tang Meijie have both stated {{they do not want to}} be compared to [...] "Harvard Girl."

Nevertheless, many of China's top students are still compared to [...] "Harvard Girl," [...] and admissions to top overseas universities often make big news in mainland China; for example, Cheng Wanxin (程琬芯) attracted media attention in Sichuan province when she was accepted to Harvard in April 2009.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{its release}} Ecstasy {{received}} moderate critical acclaim.

In Loveless, <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>from</b> the 33⅓series about the My Bloody Valentine album of the same name, Mike McGonial referred to Ecstasy as a [...] "rarified, effete and poppy approach to Byrdsian rock" [...] and AllMusic rated the album two and a half out of five stars. In a separate review of Ecstasy and Wine, AllMusic writer Bradley Torreano described Ecstasy as the point where the band [...] "started moving toward Cocteau Twins territory, using guitarist Bilinda Butcher's airy voice to define their image" [...] and when [...] "Shields and Butcher [...] exploring the guitar landscapes that would later become their trademark".|$|E
