5|$|In {{writing the}} script, Thomas drew {{inspiration}} from {{the story of the}} Virgin Mary, her research on fundamentalist Mormon communities, and her own upbringing. She originally intended to produce the film on a $25,000-budget and hire her family <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>to</b> work on the cast and crew, but when the budget was raised to $1million she was able to hire professional actors. Filming took place over 25 days in Utah and Nevada in late 2011.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{there was}} {{considerable}} confusion among families with members serving in the army. It took several months for relations <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>to</b> discover the fate of their relatives and name of casualties. Initially, only very few prisoners, usually those working in important civilian industries, were sent back to France.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, at 19, {{she married}} Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, who was privately {{believed}} by family <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>to</b> be homosexual. Their marriage of 15 years remained unconsummated, and Peter at first refused Olga's {{request for a}} divorce. The couple led separate lives and their marriage was eventually annulled by the Emperor in October 1916. The following month Olga married cavalry officer Nikolai Kulikovsky, {{with whom she had}} fallen in love several years before. During the First World War, the Grand Duchess served as an army nurse at the front and was awarded a medal for personal gallantry. At the downfall of the Romanovs in the Russian Revolution of 1917, she fled to the Crimea with her husband and children, where they lived under the threat of assassination. Her brother and his family were shot by revolutionaries.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the nuclear reactor, Szilard submitted patent applications for a linear accelerator in 1928, and a cyclotron in 1929. He also conceived {{the idea of an}} electron microscope. Between 1926 and 1930, he worked with Einstein {{on the development of the}} Einstein refrigerator. After Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany in 1933, Szilard urged his family <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>to</b> flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, where he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs. While in England he discovered a means of isotope separation known as the Szilard–Chalmers effect.|$|E
5|$|Szilard {{received}} German {{citizenship in}} 1930, but was already {{uneasy about the}} political situation in Europe. When Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933, Szilard urged his family <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>to</b> flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, and transferred his savings of £1,595 (£ today) from his bank in Zurich to one in London. He lived in hotels where lodging and meals cost about £5/5 a week. For those less fortunate, he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs, and persuaded the Royal Society to provide accommodation for it at Burlington House. He {{enlisted the help of}} academics such as Harald Bohr, G. H. Hardy, Archibald Hill and Frederick G. Donnan. By the outbreak of World War II in 1939, it had helped to find places for over 2,500 refugee scholars.|$|E
5|$|Kyle, Cartman and Kenny {{surprise}} Stan {{by creating}} a Facebook account for him. Stan protests, but is quickly pressured by family <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>to</b> add them as friends. To his annoyance and frustration, Stan finds people such as Randy, his grandmother and even Wendy confronting him over his supposed disregard for them and judging his real-world friendship solely by his Facebook configuration. Meanwhile, Kyle adds shy nerdy student Kip Drordy (anagram: Dorky Drip) to his thriving friends list out of pity. Kyle's number of Facebook friends rapidly declines when he does this, {{in part due to}} a Mad Friends podcast he finds Cartman has set up in which he berates Kyle for choosing a loser as a friend and asserts nobody will want to hang out with Kyle. Kyle understands this, but, on principle and out of pity, cannot bring himself to delete Kip to please others. Desperate to stem the loss of friends, he asks Cartman for advice. Cartman introduces Kyle to Chatroulette as a way to make new friends, which fails as most {{of the people on the}} site are either jacking off or showing their genitals, until Cartman finally finds another Jewish kid named Isiah, who agrees to be Kyle's friend, much to Kyle's delight.|$|E

5|$|On the moon, {{the party}} meets the sage Fusoya, who {{explains}} that Cecil's {{father was a}} Lunarian. Fusoya also explains that a Lunarian named Zemus plans to destroy life on the Blue Planet so that the Lunarians can take over, using Golbez to summon the Giant of Babil, a colossal robot. The party returns to Earth and {{the forces of the}} two worlds attack the Giant, including Palom and Porom, who have been revived. After the party breaks the robot, Golbez and Kain confront them, only to have Fusoya break Zemus' control over Golbez, in turn releasing Kain. Cecil learns that Golbez is his older brother. Golbez and Fusoya head to the core of the moon to defeat Zemus, and Cecil's party follows. In the moon's core, the party witnesses Golbez and Fusoya kill Zemus, but then quickly fall to his resurrected form, the spirit Zeromus, the embodiment of all of Zemus' hatred and rage. Back on Earth, the Elder of Mysidia commands all of Cecil's allies <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>to</b> pray for the party, which gives Cecil and his allies the strength to fight and slay Zeromus. Following the battle, Fusoya and Golbez opt to leave Earth with the moon. Cecil, at last accepting the truth, acknowledges Golbez as his brother, and bids him farewell.|$|E
25|$|Thorn and Dillingham {{used their}} {{extensive}} networks among families <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>to</b> raise funds and receive donations of all kinds.

Thorn's nephew, Sidney Dickinson, spent time with his parents during his youth assisting at the school.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1910, Crnčić married the painter Una Virant. Their son Menci Clement was born in 1911, followed in 1915 by their daughter Branka.

25|$|In 1975, Shindo made , a {{documentary}} about his mentor {{who had died in}} 1956. The film uses film clips, footage of the hospital where the director spent his last days and interviews with actors, technicians <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>to</b> paint a portrait of the director. Shindo also wrote a book on Mizoguchi, published in 1976.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, Mackey and Renee Lawson {{borrowed}} $45,000 {{from family}} <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>to</b> open a small vegetarian natural foods store called SaferWay in Austin, (the name being a spoof of Safeway). When {{the two were}} evicted from their apartment for storing food products in it, they decided to live at the store. Because it was zoned for commercial use, there was no shower stall, so they bathed using a water hose attached to their dishwasher.|$|E
25|$|Each {{year since}} 1987 Lynott's friend Smiley Bolger hosts a festival {{for him on}} the anniversary of his death called the Vibe for Philo. A number of musicians perform at the festival {{annually}} including Thin Lizzy tribute bands and, occasionally, former Thin Lizzy members. On 4 January 1994, a trust in Lynott's name was formed by his family <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>to</b> provide scholarships for new musicians, and to make donations to charities and organisations in his memory.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of joining together with family <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>to</b> share ownership of vacation property {{has been around}} for many years. But the fractional property industry started in the U.S. in the Rocky Mountains ski resorts in the early 1990s. These first fractional developments recognized that people did not want to buy whole homes, which they would use only for a few weeks a year in the mountains. According to research firm Ragatz Associates there were over 250 fractional developments in North America in 2006 and fractional properties can now be found throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{increased}} the city's special assistants payroll from US$15.6 to US$45.6million between 1995 and 2001. Between April 29, 2001 and May 3, 2001, San Francisco Chronicle reporters Lance Williams and Chuck Finnie released a five-part story concerning Brown and {{his relations with}} city contractors, lobbyists, and city appointments and hires he had made during his tenure as Mayor. The report {{concluded that there was}} an appearance of favoritism and conflicts of interest in the awarding of city contracts and development deals, a perception that large contracts had an undue influence on city hall, and patronage with the hiring of campaign workers, contributors, legislative colleagues, <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>to</b> government positions.|$|E
25|$|The {{two films}} {{established}} Farley {{as a relatively}} bankable star and {{he was given the}} title role of Beverly Hills Ninja, which finished in first place at the box office on its opening weekend. Drug and alcohol abuse related problems interfered with Farley's film work at this time. Production of his final film, Almost Heroes, was held up several times so Farley could enter rehab. He was known among comedic contemporaries <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>to</b> be sensitive about how his comedy was perceived ("fatty falls down, everybody goes home happy"), and was particularly hurt by harsh critical reactions to Tommy Boy, a film he enjoyed making.|$|E

25|$|The Guardian {{reported}} on 4 July 2011 that Scotland Yard had discovered Dowler's voicemail had been accessed by journalists {{working for the}} News of the World and the newspaper's private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. The Guardian also reported that, during the police investigation into that newspaper's phone hacking activities, detectives discovered that journalists had deleted some messages—potential evidence—in Dowler's voicemail box because it was full, in order to free up space for new messages, to which they could listen. The deletions after Dowler was missing led family <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>to</b> {{think that she was}} still alive. It was later reported that Dowler's phone automatically deleted messages 72 hours after they were listened to.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 {{the studio}} {{had to be}} vacated when the {{building}} was demolished {{to make way for}} the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria (RACV). The Queen Street classes had attracted many students and the studio had become an important hub of intellectual and bohemian life in conservative Melbourne. Jörgensen had continued to accept architectural work and in 1934 while working on the design and construction of a studio in Eltham for the painter and cartoonist Percy Leason, he decided that it was here he wanted to live, and so the Montsalvat dream began. Jörgensen invited his students <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>to</b> join him in Eltham where he harnessed their collective enthusiasm in the building of Montsalvat.|$|E
25|$|Many {{collectors}} {{ask their}} family <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>to</b> save stamps for {{them from their}} mail. Although the stamps received by major businesses and those kept by elderly relatives may be of international and historical interest, the stamps received from family members are often of the definitive sort. Definitives seem mundane but, considering their variety of colours, watermarks, paper differences, perforations and printing errors, they can fill many pages in a collection. Introducing either variety or specific focus to a collection can require the purchasing of stamps, either from a dealer or online. Large numbers of relatively recent stamps, often still attached to fragments or envelopes, may be obtained cheaply and easily. Rare and old stamps can also be obtained, but these can be very expensive.|$|E
