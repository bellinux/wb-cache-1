5|$|During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 Océan was <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the Northern Squadron that {{attempted}} to blockade Prussian ports on the Baltic until recalled on 16 September 1870 {{and ordered to}} return to Cherbourg. Afterward she was <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the Evolutionary Squadron until 1875 when she was placed in reserve. Océan was recommissioned in 1879 for service with the Mediterranean Squadron. She had a lengthy refit in 1884–85 and was <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the Northern Squadron after it was completed. Around 1888 the ship was transferred back to the Mediterranean Squadron until she was reduced to reserve around 1891. Océan was <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the Gunnery School that same year and later became a training ship for naval apprentices before being condemned in 1894.|$|E

At the same time, Hannibal, Mars, Magnificent, and Victorious were <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the 9th Battle Squadron and stationed in the Humber to protect the British coast. Illustrious was instead used as a guard ship for the Grand Fleet, and was initially based at Loch Ewe.|$|E

5|$|One {{source of}} skilled {{personnel}} was the Army itself, particularly the Army Specialized Training Program.

Another source was the Women's Army Corps (WAC). Initially intended for clerical tasks handling classified material, the WACs were soon tapped for technical and scientific tasks as well. On 1 February 1945, all military personnel <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the MED, including all SED detachments, were <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the 9812th Technical Service Unit, except at Los Alamos, where military personnel other than SED, including the WACs and Military Police, were <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the 4817th Service Command Unit.|$|E

The trials were done among {{children and young people}} for whom drugs failed to control their seizures, and only one of the trials compared a group <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> ketogenic diet with a group not <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable. Nearly 40% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years. Adverse effects such as hunger and loss of energy in that trial were common, with about 30% experiencing constipation.|$|E
