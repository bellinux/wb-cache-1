Live in Chicago premiered on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) {{and drew}} in over 8.87 million viewers, {{therefore}} becoming the second-most-viewed concert film on television, behind Celine Dion's A New Day... Live in Las Vegas (2003). Following its success on television, NBC was interested again in collaborating with Twain {{for a second}} prime time special. Twain accepted the offer, but desired to deviate from high-elaboration, and perform a show much more stripped and intimate than the one filmed for Up! Live in Chicago or those included in her Up! Tour (2003–04). She explained, [...] "I {{wanted to go back}} to something stripped-down and rootsy.

[...] Elsewhere, he nevertheless remarked that he felt his career had [...] "transcended the gay movement. I mean, my sexuality has nothing to do with my music. When I'm fucking I'm not thinking about singing and vice versa." [...] He was openly critical of what he perceived as divisive tendencies within the gay community itself, noting that [...] "I get this conformist shit from queens all the time. They always want to read me. They always want me to do it their way. I am not going to conform to the gay lifestyle as they see it and that's for sure".

He literally stood on top of the mixing board—we were worried he was going to hit his head on the ceiling, but he didn't. He ended up being very excited about that track, and then he added his spin to it, musically, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>it.</b> To me, he elevated the lyrics with the music. It's like a siren, alerting people." [...] In December 2014, thirteen demos of tracks for the album, including [...] "Illuminati", were leaked to the Internet. To avoid further leaks, Madonna released six completed tracks, including the final version of [...] "Illuminati" [...] with the addition of West's writing and production, with the pre-order for the album on the iTunes Store on December 20, 2014, as an [...] "early Christmas gift".|$|E

Then, through the long winter, when the snow lies firm and white, and the wheat crop has been hauled in, you can hear the jingling sleigh teams flit across the prairie from homestead to homestead under the cloudless blue.

I know every yard of land we own, and I know what it will produce. It interests me to try experiments--new crops, a new distribution of crops, new machinery sometimes, new methods of fertilizing.

I think he did; and now it seems so like a friend to me, I love it better every day. I watch the sun climb up along the roofs in the morning, creeping higher and higher till it shines upon the cross and turns it into gold.

Youth is sweet, with its fiery enterprise, and I suppose mature manhood will be just as much so, though in a calmer way, and age, quieter still, will have its own merits,--the thing is only to do with life what we ought, and what is suited to each of its stages; do all, enjoy all,--and I suppose these two rules amount to the same thing. Only catch real earnest hold of life, not play with it, and not defer one part of it for the sake of another, then each part of life will do for us what was intended. People talk of the hardships of {{military}} service, of the miseries that we undergo fighting for our country. I have undergone my share, I believe,--hard toil in the wilderness, hunger, extreme weariness, pinching cold, the torture of a wound, peril of death; and really I have been as happy through it as ever I was at my mother's cosey fireside of a winter's evening. If I had died, I doubt not my last moments would have been happy. There is no use of life, but just to find out what is fit for us to do; and, doing it, it seems to be little matter whether we live or die in it.
