5|$|Although <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> {{the poems}} {{attributed}} to Narihira in imperial anthologies are dubious, {{there is a}} large enough body of his work contained in the relatively reliable Kokinshū for scholars to discuss Narihira's poetic style.

5|$|Recent {{scientific}} investigations support Waitt’s proposed {{separation of}} layers into records of sequential flood events.

5|$|Since <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Tyrannosauruss {{potential}} prey {{could move}} quickly, {{evidence that it}} walked instead of ran could indicate {{that it was a}} scavenger. On the other hand, recent analyses suggest that Tyrannosaurus, while slower than large modern terrestrial predators, may well have been fast enough to prey on large hadrosaurs and ceratopsians.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{legend of}} the jackalope, upon which the Wyoming taxidermists were building, {{may be related to}} similar stories in other cultures and other historical times. Researchers suggest that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the tales of horned hares were inspired by sightings of rabbits infected with the Shope papilloma virus. It causes horn- and antler-like tumors to grow in various places on a rabbit's head and body.|$|E
5|$|These {{extension}} {{plans were}} {{rejected by the}} government in 2004, due to escalating costs.

5|$|After closure, {{the line}} was largely forgotten. Because it had been built on private land without an Act of Parliament, few records of it prior to the Oxford {{extension}} schemes exist in official archives. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the rails remained in place in 1940, as records exist of their removal during the building of RAF Westcott. Other than the station buildings at Westcott and Quainton Road almost nothing survives of the tramway, {{although much of the}} route can still be traced by a double line of hedges. The former trackbed between Quainton Road and Waddesdon Road is now a public footpath known as the Tramway Walk.|$|E
5|$|Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) call Angela's husband Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) {{to inform}} {{him that the}} {{documentary}} will probably out him and reveal that Angela slept with Dwight. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) becomes obsessed with online comments regarding his brief appearance in the promo, posting lengthy replies and even uploading his own video in response to negative reactions.

5|$|Arthur Blake Heinemann {{created the}} first breed {{standard}} and, in 1894, he founded the Devon and Somerset Badger Club, the aims of which were to promote badger digging rather than fox hunting, and the breeding of terriers suitable for this purpose. Terriers were acquired from Nicholas Snow of Oare, and they were likely descended from Russell's original dogs, as Russell would probably have hunted at some point with Snow's hunting club {{and is likely to}} have provided <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> their original terriers. By the turn of the 20th century, Russell's name had become associated with this breed of dog.|$|E

5|$|As a {{young man}} he married Rampanambonitany. Oral history {{provides}} two conflicting accounts of their marriage. According to one version, the couple had no children of their own, leading the king to adopt the eight daughters and five sons of his sister Rangorinimerina. In another version, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the five sons and eight daughters issued from the king's marriage, and his son Rakotomavo was adopted from a woman called Rangorimanana. The remaining four sons were named Andriantoarana, Andriamohara, Ratsimanjaka and Andriampalimana. The names of only three of his eight daughters are preserved in the oral histories: Randriamizaza, Rahisatra and Rahira.|$|E
5|$|At {{around this}} time Etty began to receive many {{unsolicited}} letters from wealthy Old Etonian lawyer Thomas Myers. Myers was a huge admirer of Etty, and his letters mainly suggest literary topics he felt Etty ought to be painting so as {{to appeal to the}} nobility; he wrote regularly between July 1832 and May 1844. Although eccentric and largely incoherent (one of his suggestions was for Etty to raise his profile by painting nude portraits of the wives of the aristocracy), Etty appears to have taken <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Myers's suggestions seriously.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, it {{was also}} {{recorded}} from the cave of Ankilitelo in southwestern Madagascar. Remains of a large Macrotarsomys had previously been reported from other southern Madagascar sites, and <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these may be M.petteri. A karstic deposit near Lake Tsimanampetsotsa (dated to the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene on unclear grounds) contained three species of Macrotarsomys, including a very large one {{that may well be}} M.petteri. Remains identified as greater big-footed mouse have been reported from a cave at Ankazoabo in southern Madagascar; these may also be Petter's big-footed mouse.|$|E

5|$|In Yellowstone's hot waters, {{bacteria}} form mats {{of bizarre}} shapes consisting of trillions of individuals. These bacteria {{are some of}} the most primitive life forms on earth. Flies and other arthropods live on the mats, even in the middle of the bitterly cold winters. Initially, scientists thought that microbes there gained sustenance only from sulfur. In 2005 researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder discovered that the sustenance for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the diverse hyperthermophilic species is molecular hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{at what point}} among the extant fragments the division between books 1 and 2 fell, but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the Aeolid families were covered in the second book. The families of Perieres, Deion and Sisyphus (in that order) were most likely found in the 2nd book because there {{does not appear to}} be enough room left in book 1 to accommodate them as a group after the children of Neleus and Pelias. It was once thought that the Ehoie of Atalanta opened the book, but recently published evidence casts doubt upon this view (see Book 3, below).|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{was driving}} from Leeds to Southampton Docks {{when he picked}} up Figard on 19 December 1995.

He was arrested in February 1996 after another lorry driver recognised him from a photofit. Morgan initially denied meeting her, but after he was picked out at an identity parade, he claimed he and Figard had met and engaged in consensual sex.|$|E
