Like when he died, it was just weird to think about doing shows or recording without him around, {{even if he was}} no longer in the band. He was a good person and definitely deserves to be remembered.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} outside of Japan by Sega, who packaged the heroine as a rugged gladiator {{instead of the}} dainty-looking sorceress she originally was. Due {{to the lack of}} publicity for the game internationally, Alisia Dragoon did not make <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> on the video game market, despite the critical acclaim it received.|$|E
5|$|Fisheries {{also have}} {{negative}} effects on seabirds, and these effects, particularly on the long-lived and slow-breeding albatrosses, {{are a source of}} increasing concern to conservationists. The bycatch of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has had <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Overall, many hundreds of thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year, a source of concern for some of the rarest species (for example, only about 2,000 short-tailed albatrosses are known to still exist). Seabirds are also thought to suffer when overfishing occurs.|$|E

5|$|With the {{exception}} of Tesla Motors, almost all new cars in the United States are sold through dealerships, so they {{play a crucial role}} in the sales of electric vehicles, and negative attitudes can hinder early adoption of plug-in electric vehicles. Dealers decide which cars they want to stock, and a salesperson can have <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> on how someone feels about a prospective purchase. Sales people have ample knowledge of internal combustion cars while they do not have time to learn about a technology that represents a fraction of overall sales. As with any new technology, and in the particular case of advanced technology vehicles, retailers are central to ensuring that buyers, especially those switching to a new technology, have the information and support they need to gain the full benefits of adopting this new technology.|$|E
5|$|Born in Chatham, Kent, Boyd {{started his}} career as a part of Charlton Athletic's youth system at the age of 15. A year later he was {{released}} by Charlton, and opted to join Conference National side Stevenage Borough in 2001. Boyd made his Stevenage debut at just 17 years of age during the 2002–03 season, featuring in a 3–1 defeat against Margate at Broadhall Way, although he was substituted at half–time. Despite appearing on the bench frequently, Boyd did not play again in the first-team the same season. The following season, Boyd played eleven times {{during the second half of}} the season under new manager Graham Westley, after impressing him during Boyd's involvement in the FA Youth Cup. Boyd made <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> despite appearing as a substitute in the majority of the matches, assisting all three of Stevenage's goals in a 3–1 victory over Tamworth, and scoring his first Stevenage goal in a 2–1 win against Northwich Victoria in April 2004.|$|E
5|$|Sir Alex Ferguson {{guaranteed}} {{a place in}} the starting line-up for Paul Scholes, after the midfielder had missed the 1999 final through suspension. Ferguson made one change from the team that had beaten Wigan Athletic to secure the league title 10 days earlier, with Owen Hargreaves starting {{on the right side of}} midfield in a 4–4–2 formation in place of Park Ji-sung, who did not even make the substitutes bench despite starting both legs of the semi-final. Cristiano Ronaldo started on the left wing, where he was pitted against makeshift Chelsea right-back Michael Essien. This went against the prediction of The Guardians David Pleat, who thought a duel between Ronaldo and Ashley Cole would be key to the final. Ferguson hoped his substitutes might have <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> on the match, just as Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær did in 1999, when the pair came off the bench to help Manchester United come from behind and beat Bayern Munich. A week before the game, Ryan Giggs was philosophical about his chances of being included in the starting line-up; he was eventually named as one of seven allowed substitutes.|$|E

25|$|Excavations {{were also}} {{carried out in}} the ancient towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, both of which had been covered by ash during the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. These {{excavations}} began in 1748 in Pompeii, while in Herculaneum they began in 1738. The discovery of entire towns, complete with utensils and even human shapes, as well the unearthing of ancient frescos, had <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> throughout Europe.|$|E
25|$|Stone {{attended}} Trinity School in New York City {{before his}} parents sent him away to The Hill School, a college-preparatory school in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. His parents were divorced abruptly {{while he was}} away at school (1962) and this, because he was an only child, marked him deeply. Stone's mother was often absent and his father made <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> on his life; father-son relationships were to feature heavily in Stone's films perhaps because of this.|$|E
25|$|Salt marshes are {{sometimes}} included in lagoons, {{and the difference}} is not very marked; the Venetian Lagoon in Italy, for example, {{is made up of}} these sorts of animals and or living organisms belonging to this ecosystem. They have <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> on the biodiversity of the area. Salt marsh ecology involves complex food webs which include primary producers (vascular plants, macroalgae, diatoms, epiphytes, and phytoplankton), primary consumers (zooplankton, macrozoa, molluscs, insects), and secondary consumers.|$|E

Following his work at Essex with world expert bowling coach Ian Pont Steyn returned to domestic cricket in South Africa, where he bowled excellently for the Titans through the 2005/2006 season which earned him a recall to the Test squad to face New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Many {{well-known}} architects {{come from}} Birmingham. From the Victorian era, Yeoville Thomason, J. A. Chatwin and Martin & Chamberlain made <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> on the city. In the early 20th century, Harry Weedon designed over 300 Odeon cinemas across the country. Hurley Robinson also designed numerous cinemas around the United Kingdom. William Alexander Harvey {{played a key}} part {{in the design and}} construction of Bournville. In the postwar period, John Madin became a prolific architect and more recently, Glenn Howells and Ken Shuttleworth have made their mark on the international stage.|$|E
30|$|Lack of {{security}} education – {{people continue to}} be a weak point in information security [53].

25|$|Early {{electrification}} was too {{limited to}} have <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> {{on the late}} 19th century economy. Electricity was also very expensive because of the low conversion efficiency of fuel to power, the small scale of power plants {{and the fact that}} most utilities offered only nighttime service. Daytime service became common during the early 20th century after the introduction of the AC motor, which tended to be used more during the day, balancing the load. Until that time a large share of power was self-generated by the user, such as a factory, hotel or electric street railway (tram or streetcar).|$|E
25|$|Gleizes was {{in nearly}} every sense a {{maverick}} Cubist, perhaps the most unyielding of them all; both in his paintings and writings (which had <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>impact</b> on the image of Cubism in Europe and the United States). He developed a single-minded, thoroughly uncompromising Cubism without the diversion of a classical alternative. During the 1920s Gleizes worked on a highly abstract brand of Cubism. In addition to his shows at Léonce Rosenberg's L'Effort Moderne, the dealer-publisher Povolozky printed his writings. His art was indeed backed by a prodigious theoretical effluence, most notably in La Peinture et ses lois (first published in La Vie des Lettres, October 1922). Gleizes fused aesthetic, metaphysical, moral and social priorities to describe the status and function of art.|$|E
25|$|Montana {{subsequently}} led the 49ers 83 {{yards to}} the Dallas 6-yard line. Elliott rushed four times for 30 yards on the drive, while Solomon also made <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>impact,</b> catching two passes for 18 yards and rushing for 15 on a wide receiver reverse. Facing third down and 3 on the Cowboys 6 with 58 seconds left, Montana threw a high pass that Clark just managed to break ahead of Walls and reach {{in the air for}} the game-winning touchdown reception. Other contributors on the final 89-yard drive that led to the play now referred to as “The Catch” included Freddie Solomon (WR), Lenvil Elliott (RB), Earl Cooper (FB), Mike Wilson, Charle Young (TE), Dan Audick (LT), John Ayers (LG), Fred Quillan (C), Randy Cross (RG), and Keith Fahnhorst (RT).|$|E
