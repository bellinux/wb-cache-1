40|$|Highly {{homogeneous}} transparent titania gels {{have been}} successfully prepared from titanium alkoxide by a sol–gel method utilizing chelating agent, ethyl <b>acetylacetate</b> (EtAcAc), {{in the presence of}} strong acid anions. Only catalytic amount of a strong acid anion suppress the rapid hydrolysis of titanium alkoxide by blocking the nucleophilic attack of HO − and H 2 O, and the resultant moderate sol–gel reactions thus afford homogeneous gelation, leading to transparent monolithic titania gels. Gelation time can be widely controlled by changing amounts of water, chelating agent and salt. The ability of salts to suppress the too abrupt sol–gel reactions is strongly dependent on the electronegativity of anions and valence of cations. With employing NH 4 NO 3 as a suppressing electrolyte, the obtained titania gels can be converted to pure TiO 2 by simple washing and heat-treatment, and transformations to anatase and rutile structures were found to start at 400 and 600 °C, respectively. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Gallium- 67 (67 Ga) {{has been}} used as a {{radionuclide}} for imaging a variety of solid tumors since 1969. Since then use of various gallium-based radiotracers has been reported. Recently, 67 Ga-labeled <b>acetylacetate</b> bis(thiosemicarbazones) (67 Ga-AATS) complex with significant tumor accumulation and fast blood clearance has been employed. Materials and Methods In this study, the absorbed dose of 67 Ga-AATS in each human organ was evaluated and compared with 67 Ga-citrate as the most commonly used form of 67 Ga in nuclear medicine. 67 Ga was produced via 68 Zn(p, 2 n) 67 Ga reaction at 30 MeV cyclotron. Moreover, 67 Ga-AATS was produced by adding 50 µl of AATS to absolute ethanol (1 mg/ml) in a gallium-containing vial at 80 - 90 °C. The absorbed dose of each human organ was calculated, using RADAR method, based on biodistribution data in Wistar rats. Results According to the results, 67 Ga-AATS was produced with radionuclidic and radiochemical purity higher than 99 % and 93 %, respectively. The highest absorbed dose was reported in the bone surface (0. 401 mGy/MBq), whereas the whole-body absorbed dose was 0. 092 mGy/MBq. Conclusion The absorbed dose of each human organ was comparable with the absorbed dose received by each organ after 67 Ga-citrate injection.

Gold palladium catalysts supported on various oxides were prepared and screened with titania supported catalysts proving {{to be the most}} active. Different preparation methodologies were used to prepare titania supported bi-metallic catalysts, co-deposition precipitation methodology was found to give the most active and stable catalyst. Further gold, palladium and gold palladium catalysts were prepared supported on ceria that had been obtained from the calcination of cerium <b>acetylacetate</b> that had been precipitated into a supercritical carbon dioxide antisolvent. These catalysts proved to be significantly more active than those supported on the ceria form the simple calcination of the precursor. Reuse experiments showed that the supercritically prepared ceria precursor catalyst increased in activity with use, despite significant leaching of the metals, an effect not observed for the non-supercritically prepared ceria precursor catalyst. The ceria catalysts prepared by the supercritical antisolvent method displayed very high turn over frequencies for the oxidation of l-octen- 3 -ol, 2 -octen-l-ol and cinnamyl alcohol. Gold and gold palladium catalysts supported on titania and graphite were used for the oxidation of 2, 5 -dimethyl furan to form hex- 3 -ene- 2, 5 -dione.

40|$|Teplyakov, Andrew V. Metal oxide {{materials}} {{have been widely}} used in the fields of catalysis and gas sensing fields. Due to its unique physical and chemical properties, zinc oxide (ZnO) has attracted considerable attention. It is not only used as a catalyst for various surface reactions but also as a catalytic support. Cu/ZnO is a commonly used industrial catalyst for methanol synthesis. In chapter 3, to understand the surface chemistry between Cucontaining species and ZnO substrate, we utilized the vacuum-based techniques to produce a Cu/ZnO catalyst with molecular-level control, using a common chemical vapor deposition precursor, copper hexafluoroacetylacetonate vinyl trimethyl silane, Cu(hfac) (VTMS), to grow copper nanoparticles on commercial ZnO powder. This deposition process is investigated by high-vacuum Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The growth is found to be promoted by exposing ZnO powder to the gas-phase water, and the intensity of the hydroxyl groups stretching signatures in infrared decrease after the powder is exposed to the copper deposition precursor. Vibrational spectroscopy results support the reaction on both polar and (101 0) surfaces of the powder, and XPS confirms that the copper deposition takes place and identifies Cu+ species as the main copper species on the surface of ZnO powder. The mechanism of the reaction includes the elimination of the hfac ligand that reacts with surface hydrogen present in hydroxyl groups, and this surface-limited process stops when the surface runs out of available hydrogen. SEM is used to visualize the formation of copper-containing nanoparticles on ZnO(101 0) and ZnO(0001) surfaces and defects. The mechanism for the initial stages of the deposition is proposed based on the computational investigation consistent with the experimental results. With successful growth of copper on the ZnO surface, the next issue to be addressed is how to remove the surface contamination, which originates mainly from surface-bound hfac ligands. Therefore two independent studies for the chemical and thermal stability of hfac ligands on ZnO surface have been undertaken in order to understand how to remove surface hfac ligands. In chapter 4, a number of surface-bound species including ethoxy, acetoxy, <b>acetylacetate,</b> or 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5 -hexafluoroacetylacetate (hfac) are generated on ZnO powder and their displacement behavior was investigated. The displacement of the surface species formed by these compounds on ZnO powder surfaces by a gas-phase reagent is described by a model predicted by density functional theory and the strength of binding of the second layer on top of the first is provided by the H of sublimation. This simple model is tested by infrared spectroscopy following the adsorption of one compound and its displacement by the other. A correlation between the enthalpic driving force and the percentage of the displaced species observed experimentally is found. Based on these results, it appears that the adsorbed hfac ligand is very tightly bound and is not susceptible to displacement by other common organic compounds that can also serve as surface–bound ligands. Thus, finding an appropriate displacement agent for hfac removal from ZnO requires further research. In chapter 5, the mechanisms of decomposition during thermal transformation of three -diketones, acetylacetone (acacH), 1, 1, 1 -trifluoroacetylacetone (tfacH), and 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5 -hexafluoroacetylacetone (hfacH), are analyzed on ZnO powder surface using FT-IR, XPS, and density functional theory (DFT) computational investigation. The initial O-H dissociation leads to the formation of corresponding -diketonates in all the cases investigated. These diketonates are important surface intermediates that can be generated in a controlled manner in these experiments. The presence on the C-CF 3 entity determines the preferred thermal decomposition pathways, as the C-C bond in this group starts to react with a surface of ZnO around 400 K, followed by immediate decomposition of the resulting CF 3 group. Above 600 K, the presence of the CF 3 - substituent leads to the formation of ketene-like structures observed by vibrational spectroscopy. The reaction mechanisms examined with the help of DFT calculations are correlated with vibrational signatures of the species produced and with the Fcontaining species recorded by XPS. From this experiment, we know that surface hfac species decomposes around 400 K. Thus, to avoid this decomposition pathway, thermal treatment of the hfac-covered Cu/ZnO catalyst needs to adhere to exclusively low temperature regimes, below this decomposition temperature. The thermal chemistry of the hfac-covered Cu/ZnO is also examined by annealing to the desired temperatures. The C-CF 3 bond dissociation causes the formation of the ketenes as determined by FTIR, but this takes place at lower surface temperatures. Due to the similarity of thermal reactions of hfac on Cu/ZnO and on clean ZnO powder, we utilize time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) profiles for different annealing temperatures. Surprisingly, surface bonding of hfac ligands does change following even very mild annealing. For annealing temperatures around 350 K, the ToF-SIMS investigation suggests that the intact hfac ligand is transferred from copper species to the ZnO surface, making copper nanoparticles available for other surface processes. This conclusion is supported by XPS, since the copper nanoparticles are found to be oxidized without hfac protection (if the surface is annealed to 350 K). Our study suggests that the nanoparticle is involved in this transmetalation process and adsorbed hfac can spill over to the ZnO support material, making it a potentially very valuable method to prepare Cu/ZnO catalytic systems. In chapter 6, a gas sensor application of metal oxides is investigated with the focus on the role of oxygen to avoid sulfur poisoning during the use of a commercial SnO 2 -based H 2 S sensor. The commercial H 2 S sensor is first tested under low vacuum conditions to understand the limitations of this type of sensor operating at different oxygen concentrations. Then the H 2 S sensor is interrogated under high vacuum, as it is exposed to 1 × 10 - 7 Torr of H 2 S and is shown to be reactivated by oxygen exposure of at least 1 × 10 - 4 Torr. These preliminary tests provide quantitative analysis for the oxygen needed during the process of H 2 S sensing to maintain the appropriate sensor operation. More detailed experiments are under way to propose an appropriate mechanism for the sensor poisoning. University of Delaware, Department of Chemistry and BiochemistryPh. D...|$|E
