Positioning an optical telescope in space {{means that the}} telescope does not see any <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effects</b> (see astronomical seeing), providing higher resolution images. Optical telescopes are used to look at stars, galaxies, planetary nebulae and protoplanetary disks, amongst many other things.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael's {{work from}} c. 1646 {{to the early}} 1650s, when {{he was living in}} Haarlem, is characterised by simple motifs and careful and {{laborious}} study of nature: dunes, woods, and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effects.</b> By applying heavier paint than his predecessors, Ruisdael gave his foliage a rich quality, conveying a sense of sap flowing through branches and leaves. His accurate rendering of trees was unprecedented at the time: the genera of his trees are the first to be unequivocally recognisable by modern-day botanists. His early sketches introduce motifs that would return in all his work: a sense of spaciousness and luminosity, and an airy atmosphere achieved through pointillist-like touches of chalk. Most of his thirty black chalk sketches that survive date from this period.|$|E
25|$|Later Canaletto painted grand {{scenes of}} the canals of Venice and the Doge's Palace. His {{large-scale}} landscapes portrayed the city's pageantry and waning traditions, making innovative use of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effects</b> and strong local colors. For these qualities, his works {{may be said to}} have anticipated Impressionism.|$|E
40|$|The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effect</b> on the {{radiance}} {{of sunlight}} scattered from the earth-atmosphere system is greatly {{dependent on the}} surface reflectance pattern, the contrast between adjacent fields, and the optical properties of the atmosphere. In addition, the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effect</b> is described by the range and magnitude of the adjacency <b>effects,</b> the <b>atmospheric</b> modulation transfer function, and the apparent spatial resolution of remotely sensed imagery. This paper discusses the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effect</b> on classification of surface features and shows that surface nonuniformity {{can be used for}} developing procedures to remove the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effect</b> from the satellite imagery...|$|R
40|$|The {{combined}} sensor-atmosphere characteristics, {{defined by}} the modulation transfer function, are calculated and {{used to evaluate the}} apparent resolution of remotely sensed imagery as determined by those characteristics. The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effect</b> on the upward radiance is described, and the reduction of the apparent spatial resolution due to the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effect</b> is discussed. The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effect</b> on remote sensing is compared to the effect of the sensor's pixel size, and results are presented for the maximum resolution that can be achieved in the presence of <b>atmospheric</b> blurring <b>effects...</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effect</b> on {{the upward}} {{radiance}} {{emerging from the}} atmosphere above a nonuniform surface results in a reduction of the separability between the surface classes by broadening the radiance probability distribution of each class, while narrowing the total radiance range. The atmospheric modulation transfer function (MTF) is used in Fourier transform analyses to simulate the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effect</b> on the imagery of a nonuniform surface and to demonstrate the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effect</b> on separability of field classes...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effects</b> there are effects on the near-Earth space environment. There {{is the possibility that}} orbit could become inaccessible for generations due to exponentially increasing space debris caused by spalling of satellites and vehicles (Kessler syndrome). Many launched vehicles today are therefore designed to be re-entered after use.|$|E
25|$|Leonardo's {{earliest}} dated {{drawing is}} {{a study of the}} Arno Valley, strongly emphasizing its geological features.

25|$|Sanford Robinson Gifford (July 10, 1823 – August 29, 1880) was an American {{landscape}} {{painter and}} one of the leading members of the Hudson River School. Gifford's landscapes are known for their emphasis on light and soft <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effects,</b> and he is regarded as a practitioner of Luminism, an offshoot style of the Hudson River School.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{spectral}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effect</b> on remote sensing, measurements of the spectral signature of surface cover were conducted during hazy conditions. Simultaneous measurements of the aerosol optical thickness and its vertical distribution were carried out. The upward radiance in high flight were also simulated by radiative transfer computations, {{and the results were}} compared with the measurements. It is suggested that the radiances over dark areas can be used to derive the aerosol optical thickness. Combined with climatological information, the derived optical thickness can be used to perform corrections of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century {{there is often}} a great {{richness}} in the colouration of the windows, marked by a use of tertiary colours including rich purple, salmon pink, olive green, claret red, saffron and brown. Flashed glass was skillfully employed to enhance deep folds in robes. With this interest in colour, many windows depict <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effects.</b> Sunsets, glowering storm clouds and blazing glories appear behind the figures.|$|E
25|$|In-flight {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to X-Wing, played primarily in first-person but with the option to switch to third person. All flight takes place in space; the player does not encounter gravity or <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effects.</b> Mission roles including dogfighting, escorting or disabling other craft, inspecting vehicles, and attacking capital ships and space stations. Initial missions place the player in unshielded TIE fighter variants; as the game progresses, the player gains access to advanced fighters with shields and better armaments.|$|E
40|$|Measurements of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effect</b> on the {{spectral}} signature of surface cover were conducted during hazy conditions over the Chesapeake Bay and its eastern shore. In the experiment the upward radiance {{was measured by}} an airborne scanning radiometer in nine spectral bands between 465 and 773 nm, {{above and below the}} haze layer. Simultaneous measurements of the aerosol optical thickness and its vertical distribution were conducted. The results of the measurements are used to study {{the spectral}} dependence of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effect</b> on remote sensing of water bodies and vegetated fields (forest, corn field, and pasture), and to verify theoretical predictions. It is suggested that the radiances over dark areas (e. g., water in the near IR and forest in the visible) can be used to derive the aerosol optical thickness as is done over oceans with the CZCS satellite images. Combined with climatological information, the derived optical thickness can be used to perform corrections of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effect.</b> Examples of the derivation of the aerosol optical thickness and correction of the upward radiances are given...|$|R

25|$|Clutter {{refers to}} radio {{frequency}} (RF) echoes returned from targets which are uninteresting to the radar operators. Such targets include natural {{objects such as}} ground, sea, and when not being tasked for meteorological purposes, precipitation (such as rain, snow or hail), sand storms, animals (especially birds), atmospheric turbulence, and other <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effects,</b> such as ionosphere reflections, meteor trails, and Hail spike. Clutter may also be returned from man-made objects such as buildings and, intentionally, by radar countermeasures such as chaff.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that the average global equilibrium temperature (the temperature {{in the absence of}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effects)</b> of Gliese 581g would range from 209 to 228K (−64 to −45°C, or −84 to −49°F) for Bond albedos (reflectivities) from 0.5 to 0.3 (with the latter being more characteristic of the inner Solar System). Adding an Earthlike greenhouse effect would yield an average surface temperature in the range of 236 to 261K (−37 to −12°C, or −35 to 10°F). Gliese 581g would be in an orbit where a silicate weathering thermostat could operate, and this could lead to accumulation of sufficient carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to permit liquid water to exist at the surface, provided the planet's composition and tectonic behavior could support sustained outgassing.|$|E

25|$|Michelson sought another measurement, {{but this}} time in an {{evacuated}} tube to avoid difficulties in interpreting the image owing to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>effects.</b> In 1930, he began a collaboration with Francis G. Pease and Fred Pearson to perform a measurement in a 1.6km tube 3 feet in diameter at the Irvine Ranch near Santa Ana, California. In multiple reflections the light path was increased to 10 miles. For {{the first time in}} history the speed of light was measured in an almost perfect vacuum of 0.5mm of mercury. Michelson died with only 36 of the 233 measurement series completed and the experiment was subsequently beset by geological instability and condensation problems before the result of 299,774±11km/s, consistent with the prevailing electro-optic values, was published posthumously in 1935.|$|E
