Hutton and Washbrook made three consecutive century stands, as Washbrook, with his cricket cap cocked in <b>a</b> <b>jaunty</b> style, became a familiar figure to cricket fans in Australia and England.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the young}} Kashgari women were most {{attractive}} in appearance, {{and some of the}} little girls quite lovely, their plaits of long hair falling from under <b>a</b> <b>jaunty</b> little embroidered cap, their big dark eyes, flashing teeth and piquant olive faces reminding me of Italian or Spanish children. One most beautiful boy stands out in my memory. He was clad in a new shirt and trousers of flowered pink, his crimson velvet cap embroidered with gold, and as he smiled and salaamed to us I thought he looked like a fairy prince. The women wear their hair in two or five plaits much thickened and lengthened by the addition of yak's hair, but the children in several tiny plaits.|$|E

They discover the man who bought Rupert lives in Quahog, but upon arrival, they discover the house is deserted. After seeing the moving truck and following it, with Mayor West driving, they discover the man now resides in Aspen, Colorado, meaning West drives them no further, only stopping in the Connecticut state line. To get over the mountains, the pair rent a helicopter after discovering [...] "to rent a helicopter, you can pay with cash, check, or <b>a</b> <b>jaunty</b> tune". Stewie then performs a dance for {{the man in the}} office (with help from Gene Kelly), but when Brian crashes the helicopter into the mountain, the two end up next to the entrance to Aspen.|$|E

500|$|For his {{production}} staff, Franju enlisted {{people with whom}} he had previously worked on earlier projects. Cinematographer Eugen Schüfftan, best remembered for developing the Schüfftan process, was chosen to render the visuals of the film. Schüfftan had worked with Franju on La Tête Contre les Murs (1958). Film historian David Kalat called Shüfftan [...] "the ideal choice to illustrate Franju's nightmares". (Only two years later, Shüfftan won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography, Black-and-White for his work on The Hustler (1961).) French composer Maurice Jarre created the haunting score for the film. Jarre had also previously worked with Franju on his film La Tête Contre les Murs (1958). Modern critics note the film's two imposing musical themes, <b>a</b> <b>jaunty</b> carnival-esque waltz (featured while Louise picks up young women for Doctor Génessier) and a lighter, sadder piece for Christiane. Jarre subsequently wrote the music score Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and Doctor Zhivago (1965) among other films.|$|E
500|$|Puccini's {{score is}} built around a series of motifs which recur through the opera, {{generally}} representing characters, situations and moods though sometimes without specific associations. The opening motif is a rapid burst of rhythmic music, described by Greenfield as of [...] "almost Stravinskian sharpness", which quickly transforms into a mock-solemn dirge depicting the hypocritical grief of the Donati relatives. This juxtaposition of the humorous and the solemn pervades the opera; critic Ernest Newman suggests that it [...] "keeps us perpetually suspended between the comic and the tragic". Other principal motifs include the theme associated with the lovers Rinuccio and Lauretta, introduced in Rinuccio's first solo [...] "Salvati! Salvati!", and a short, formal woodwind statement which represents Donati's will. Rinuccio sings the name [...] "Gianni Schicchi" [...] to <b>a</b> <b>jaunty</b> four-note phrase which becomes Schicchi's personal motif, and it is heard again as Schicchi {{knocks on the door}} before his first appearance. The best-known theme in the opera, that associated with Lauretta, is introduced {{in the second part of}} Rinuccio's aria [...] "Avete torto". The theme is briefly played on clarinet and violin as Lauretta enters with Schicchi, before its full expression in O mio babbino caro.|$|E
500|$|... "Slow Wine" [...] {{describes}} a Trinidadian slow grind dance, {{and the love}} ballad [...] "(Lay Your Head on My) Pillow" [...] features tender, seductive lyrics, with subtle s, which according to Gil Griffin of The Washington Post [...] "replace hip-hop braggadocio with soul music's promise." [...] "I Couldn't Keep It to Myself" [...] features lush strings and electric piano, which according to one writer [...] "create <b>a</b> <b>jaunty</b> atmosphere that harkens back to early Kool and the Gang and the Blackbyrds." [...] Its narrator wants to brag to his friends about his new girlfriend's sexual abilities. [...] "Gangsta Groove" [...] adapts hip hop's [...] "" [...] trope in a humane story, compared by one writer to a blaxploitation theme. It draws on the funk music of Parliament-Funkadelic, Cameo, and the Ohio Players. [...] "Tonyies! In the Wrong Key" [...] features a dreamy, dissonant soundscape, slurred vocals, swirling horns, and a James Brown sample. At its end, Raphael Wiggins sings the line [...] "last night a DJ saved my life", {{a reference to the}} 1982 song of the same name. Wiggins found his [...] "disinterested" [...] vocal style similar to Sly Stone's [...] "Family Affair" [...] (1971).|$|E

500|$|James Montogomery from MTV commented: [...] " [...] all pulsing sirens, wobbly {{bass and}} four-on-the-floor beat, with an {{expansive}} electro chorus {{that sounds like}} a truckload of Nintendo Entertainment Systems exploding in unison (only sexier)." [...] Frase McAlpine from BBC gave the song three out five stars and said: [...] "I can't be {{the only person in the}} world who is slightly disappointed that this song isn't <b>a</b> <b>jaunty</b> '80 syn-disco rave up, in which Madge skips around in a big pink wig, like she used to in the olden days." [...] He went on to add that [...] "Celebration" [...] is a decent dance track for Madonna to play on her tours. Stephen M. Deusner of Pitchfork Media complimented the song, calling it [...] "personality-driven pop" [...] in which Madonna has never sounded more convincing. Deusner added that the track sounds like [...] "it's conjuring several of Madonna's younger selves" [...] in its modest goal to just make people move. Sarah Crompton from The Daily Telegraph said that the song is infinitely forgettable. Popjustice named the song one of the best 100 singles of 2009. Louis Virtel of The Backlot included the song at number sixty-five on his list of [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs," [...] referring to the track as a [...] "rollicking dance jam" [...] that is a [...] "perfect companion piece to [...] other testament to celebration, Holiday.” At the 52nd Grammy Awards, the song received a nomination in the Best Dance Recording category.|$|E
500|$|Steiger portrayed a mastermind {{criminal}} {{seeking to}} obtain a $500,000 ransom, opposite James Mason and Inger Stevens, in Andrew L. Stone's Cry Terror! (1958) for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Paul Beckley of the Herald Tribune had thought Steiger [...] "superbly laconic", but Dennis Schwartz dismissed the film as [...] "an ill-conceived attempt" [...] with [...] "too many coincidences and contrived plot points to sustain interest". The following year, Steiger appeared with Claire Bloom (whom he later married) in a Fay and Michael Kanin stage production of Akira Kurosawa's 1950 film, Rashomon, where he enacted {{the role of the}} bandit originally played by Toshiro Mifune. A major success, it was lauded by critics and nominated for three Tony awards. Robert Coleman of the Daily Mirror described Steiger's performance as [...] "magnificently animalish", while Kenneth Tynan of The New Yorker thought the acting helped set new standards for Broadway. The same year, Steiger portrayed iconic mobster Al Capone in the film of the same name. Steiger was particularly keen on demonstrating the showiness of Capone, speaking thunderously, slinging a camel-hair coat over his shoulders and wearing his hat at <b>a</b> <b>jaunty</b> angle. The film, noted for its deglamorized portrayal of the subject, earned Steiger a Laurel Award for Best Male Dramatic Performance nomination. Though Hutchinson, author of Rod Steiger: Memoirs of a friendship, perceived Steiger's portrayal of Capone {{to be more of a}} caricature, George Anastasia and Glen Macnow, authors of the book The Ultimate Book of Gangster Movies, described it as one of the best screen portrayals of Capone.|$|E
500|$|Whedon {{chose the}} most {{complicated}} scene, with the most dancers and choreography in the classic style of musical theater, to accompany an 18-second song ("The Mustard") [...] "to {{get it out of}} the way" [...] for more personal numbers later in the episode. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com considers this [...] "brilliant because it frees even people who hate musicals to settle into the story without getting hung up on the genre's conventions". The musical styles span from <b>a</b> <b>jaunty</b> 1950s sitcom arrangement of the Buffy theme in the opening credits—the only episode in the series to begin without the normal version of the theme song and full cast roll, signifying a genre shift—to Anya's hard-rock version of [...] "Bunnies". Whedon assigned Emma Caulfield the rock-opera format because Caulfield often sang in such a way to him on the set. Spike's [...] "Rest in Peace" [...] is also a rock song, which Whedon wrote after completing the episode's first song, Tara's [...] "Under Your Spell", a contemporary pop song with radio-play potential. Xander and Anya's duet—the most fun to shoot but difficult to write, according to Whedon—is inspired by Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers comedies as evidenced by the silken pajama costumes and art deco apartment setting. Musically, the song uses influences from Ira Gershwin, a Charleston rhythm, and jazz-like chord slides. Giles' [...] "Standing" [...] is a ballad to Buffy that she does not hear, unlike the songs revealing truths elsewhere in the episode. Whedon shot the scene so that Giles moves in real time while Buffy works out in slow motion, to accentuate Giles' distance from her. Buffy's not hearing his song was intentional; Whedon explained, [...] "You can sing to someone in musicals and they can never know how you feel or how much you love them, even if they're standing right in front of you".|$|E
5000|$|Wisner {{has said}} {{the title of the}} song came from the fact the song was in the key of A minor, and when someone at the {{recording}} session asked what key the song was in, the reply was [...] "Asia Minor". [...] The song was recorded on a cheap, out-of-tune, piano bought for $50. Wisner had applied shellac to the hammers to achieve <b>a</b> <b>jauntier</b> sound. The record charted at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the UK, the BBC had a policy of banning records which were seen to parody classical music, and this song fell foul of it. Nonetheless, the song still charted at number 35 on the UK Singles Chart.|$|R

50|$|The song {{begins in}} <b>a</b> rather light-hearted, <b>jaunty</b> fashion, <b>a</b> slight {{pastiche}} of country music, with honky tonk style piano and twangy guitar. Ferry's singing is nonchalant and jocular.|$|R
2500|$|The Los Angeles Times in 2008 {{described}} The Italian as [...] "a shameless melodrama that, despite unfortunate stereotypes, musters considerable {{sympathy for}} its titular immigrant."

2500|$|Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "the most potent piece of satiric political cinema since Dr. Strangelove". Janet Maslin of The New York Times was very positive towards the film upon its release, stating [...] "Terry Gilliam's Brazil, <b>a</b> <b>jaunty,</b> wittily observed vision of an extremely bleak future, is a superb example {{of the power of}} comedy to underscore serious ideas, even solemn ones." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica (Palazzo Barberini) in Rome has {{a version}} {{supposedly}} executed around 1560.

A typeface for the Festival, Festival Titling, was specially commissioned and designed by Philip Boydell. It was based on condensed sans-serif capitals and had a three-dimensional form making it suitable for use in exhibition display typography. It has been said to bear [...] "a vague resemblance to bunting". [...] The lettering on the Royal Festival Hall and the temporary Festival building on the South Bank was a bold, sloping slab serif letter form, determined by Gray and her colleagues, including Charles Hasler and Gordon Cullen, illustrated in Gray’s Lettering on Buildings (1960). [...] It {{has been described as}} a [...] "turn to <b>a</b> <b>jauntier</b> and more decorative visual language" [...] that was [...] "part of a wider move towards the appreciation of vernacular arts and the peculiarities of English culture".
