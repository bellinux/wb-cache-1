40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: Narrow band imaging {{combined}} with magnifying endoscopy (NBI-ME) {{is useful for}} the detec-tion of superficial cancer in the oropharynx, hypopharynx, and esophagus. We used NBI-ME to evaluate the frequency of su-perficial cancer spread (SCS) contiguous with advanced oropharyngeal <b>and</b> hypopharyngeal <b>cancers</b> <b>and</b> esophageal <b>cancers.</b> Study Design: Retrospective. Methods: We retrospectively studied 45 patients with oropharyngeal <b>and</b> hypopharyngeal <b>cancer</b> <b>and</b> 44 with esopha-geal cancer who underwent NBI-ME from October 2006 through April 2009. The following variables were evaluated: 1) the frequency of SCS contiguous with advanced oropharyngeal <b>and</b> hypopharyngeal <b>cancer</b> <b>and</b> esophageal <b>cancer,</b> <b>and</b> 2) the influence of SCS contiguous with advanced oropharyngeal <b>and</b> hypopharyngeal <b>cancer</b> on clinical T category and clinical stage. Results: SCS contiguous with the primary tumor was found in 49 % (22 / 45) of the patients with advanced oropharyn-geal <b>and</b> hypopharyngeal <b>cancer</b> <b>and</b> in 52 % (23 / 44) of those with advanced esophageal cancer. When SCS contiguous with the primary tumor {{was included in the}} evaluation of tumor size in advanced oropharyngeal <b>and</b> hypopharyngeal <b>cancer,</b> the clinical T category and clinical stage were revised in 20 % (9 / 45) and 4 % (2 / 45) of patients, respectively; SCS was 2 cm in 64 % of cases (14 / 22) and between> 2 cm and 4 cm in 36 % (8 / 22).
