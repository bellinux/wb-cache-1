5|$|The Special Troops Battalion {{was formed}} {{as part of}} a {{reorganization}} of the 173d Airborne Brigade into a modular brigade. The battalion was designed to be the self-contained command component of the brigade, allowing it to function independently of <b>any</b> <b>higher</b> command. The battalion was activated on 8 June 2006. Most of its components were drawn from the 82nd Engineer Battalion, which inactivated on 30 March 2006. On 21 April 2006, a coat of arms and a distinctive unit insignia were approved for the battalion.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} dense cirrus at their tops. As the {{cumulonimbus}} cloud in a thunderstorm grows vertically, the liquid water droplets freeze {{when the air}} temperature reaches the freezing point. The anvil cloud takes its shape because the temperature inversion at the tropopause prevents the warm, moist air forming the thunderstorm from rising <b>any</b> <b>higher,</b> thus creating the flat top. In the tropics, these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of cirrus from their anvils. High-altitude winds commonly push this dense mat out into an anvil shape that stretches downwind as much as several kilometers.|$|E
5|$|The local batsmen {{were unable}} to cope with Lindwalls high pace and swing; 43 of his wickets came after his {{opponent}} had missed the ball and been bowled. Lindwall scored 411 runs at 24.17 with two fifties in the first-class matches, including 191 at 31.83 in the Tests. Lindwall had limited batting opportunities, usually playing from No. 7 to No. 9. It was hard for Lindwall to get <b>any</b> <b>higher</b> up the order as Australia's other frontline bowlers, such as Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, all scored centuries and more than 20 fifties each during their first-class career, and were of similar batting ability. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions due to their batting strength, Lindwall only had 20 innings in his 22 matches, and usually batted at Nos. 7, 8 and 9.N- However, he was often effective when he did get an opportunity.|$|E

5|$|Troubled by her daughter's {{indifferent}} attitude, Chanda narrates her dilemma to Dr. Diwan, who {{suggests that}} she hire a math tutor for Apu. Chanda is told that Apu must pass her pre-board math exams {{to receive a}} considerable discount for the tuition. Hearing this, Apu replies that she is destined {{to work as a}} maid, as Chanda cannot provide financially for <b>any</b> <b>higher</b> education. With the encouragement of Dr. Diwan, Chanda enrolls in Apu's school so that she can learn math and tutor Apu herself. This embarrasses Apu, and she continuously ridicules her mother. No one, except for the school's principal Mr. Srivastava (Tripathi), is aware of Chanda's relationship to Apu; she manages to befriend Apu's classmates, including Sweety and Pintu, and impresses her teachers with her steady progress. Chanda enlists the help of her shy classmate Amar (Vishal Nath) to understand math and makes use of mind maps on his advice.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} attempt of {{purposeful}} espionage against the fortress {{was conducted in}} 1913–14. A former lieutenant in the Danish coastal artillery, A. B. Fredrikssen, was enlisted in Copenhagen by the Russian military attaché in Stockholm, colonel Assanovitch. Fredrikssen was sent to Boden with the task to explore the fortress and its surroundings. He and his wife stayed at a boarding house in the city, and had regular correspondence with his employer who stayed in Copenhagen. It was also the correspondence that exposed the attempt, which was not very successful in terms of information gained by the Russians. They had better luck in late 1914 with two brothers named Hiukka, who both served {{with one of the}} artillery regiments in Boden, Norrland Artillery Regiment. They were discovered due to their extravagant living, and it was found out that one of the brothersdespite his employment in the armyhad Finnish-Russian citizenship. They had provided intelligence to Russia, but {{the full extent of the}} affair was never disclosed. A minor case of German espionage was exposed during the Second World War. The first permanently stationed German officer in Luleå, a Hauptmann Schultz, was caught photographing parts of the fortifications and was deported. It is probable that his espionage was not ordered from <b>any</b> <b>higher</b> command but was an act on own initiative.|$|E
