5|$|A {{complication}} arose when Venancio Sanchez of St. Augustine {{purchased for}} US$400 a half {{share in the}} old Fornells grant from another surviving heir, who lived in Havana. A feud quickly developed between Sanchez and the Davises, with Sanchez demanding {{a division of the}} property, and the Davises refusing to acknowledge that Sanchez had <b>any</b> <b>claim</b> to the island. The Davises had hoped that a restored lighthouse would be the centerpiece of their town, but all attempts to repair the lighthouse failed while the war was on. Shortly {{after the end of the}} war, the Davises gave up on Key Biscayne and moved to Texas. Their older son Edmund J. Davis eventually was elected as governor there.|$|E
5|$|In 1218 and 1219, Jocelin also {{ended the}} dispute between his diocese and Glastonbury Abbey. Jocelin gave up <b>any</b> <b>claim</b> to {{control of the}} abbey, and the abbey gave the bishopric a number of estates. Previously, the bishops, {{as part of their}} attempt to annexe Glastonbury to their bishopric, had been known as the Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury. They also had held the office of abbot. In 1218, as part of the settlement, a new abbot was elected at Glastonbury. The papacy had never {{acknowledged}} Jocelin's claiming of the title of abbot. The historian J. A. Robinson felt that as part of the settlement, Jocelin began to use the title Bishop of Bath and Wells, but another historian, David Knowles, disagreed.|$|E

5|$|It also {{provided}} for the Court of First Instance (now known as the General Court) to be based in Luxembourg with the Court of Justice, which remained there. However, this agreement dropped the provision from the 1965 decision, which gave priority to Luxembourg for any new judicial and financial bodies. In response, Luxembourg attached a unilateral declaration stating it did not renounce this article. However they did renounce <b>any</b> <b>claim</b> to {{the seat of the}} judicial Boards of Appeal of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market via the Treaty of Nice.|$|E
5|$|On 30 December 1777, Maximilian Joseph, {{the last}} of the junior line of Wittelsbach, died of smallpox, leaving no children. Charles IV Theodore, a scion of a senior branch of the House of Wittelsbach, held the closest claim of kinship, but he also had no {{legitimate}} children to succeed him. His cousin, Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken, therefore had a legitimate legal claim as Charles Theodore's heir presumptive. Across Bavaria's southern border, Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II coveted the Bavarian territory and had married Maximilian Joseph's sister Maria Josepha in 1765 to strengthen <b>any</b> <b>claim</b> he could extend. His agreement with the heir, Charles Theodore, to partition the territory neglected any claims of the heir presumptive, Charles August.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} four years, neither Henry nor the barons were able to restore {{stability}} in England, and power swung {{back and forth between}} the different factions. One of the priorities for the new regime was to settle the long-running dispute with France and, at the end of 1259, Henry and Eleanor left for Paris to negotiate the final details of a peace treaty with King Louis, escorted by Simon de Montfort and much of the baronial government. Under the treaty, Henry gave up <b>any</b> <b>claim</b> to his family's lands in the north of France, but was confirmed as the legitimate ruler of Gascony and various neighbouring territories in the south, giving homage and recognising Louis as his feudal lord for these possessions.|$|E

5|$|By 1182 Young Henry reiterated his {{previous}} demands: {{he wanted to}} be granted lands, for example the Duchy of Normandy, which would allow him to support himself and his household with dignity. Henry refused, but agreed to increase his son's allowance, but this was not enough to placate Young Henry. With trouble clearly brewing, Henry attempted to defuse the situation by insisting that Richard and Geoffrey give homage to Young Henry for their lands. Richard did not believe that Young Henry had <b>any</b> <b>claim</b> over Aquitaine and refused to give homage; when Henry forced Richard to give homage, Young Henry angrily refused to accept it. Young Henry formed an alliance with some of the disgruntled barons of the Aquitaine who were unhappy with Richard's rule, and Geoffrey sided with him, raising a mercenary army in Brittany to threaten Poitou. Open war broke out in 1183 and Henry and Richard led a joint campaign into Aquitaine: before they could conclude it, however, Young Henry caught a fever and died, bringing a sudden end to the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Earlier historians, {{including}} Beale, {{believed that}} money drove events, {{and had seen}} Reconstruction as an economic struggle. They also accepted, for the most part, that reconciliation between North and South {{should have been the}} top priority of Reconstruction. In the 1950s, historians began to focus on the African-American experience as central to Reconstruction. They rejected completely <b>any</b> <b>claim</b> of black inferiority, which had marked many earlier historical works, and saw the developing Civil Rights Movement as a second Reconstruction; some writers stated they hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights. These authors sympathized with the Radical Republicans for their desire to help the African American, and saw Johnson as callous towards the freedman. In a number of works from 1956 onwards by such historians as Fawn Brodie, the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur of efforts to better the freedman's lot. These volumes included major biographies of Stevens and Stanton. Reconstruction was increasingly seen as a noble effort to integrate the freed slaves into society.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette, when captured, {{had tried}} to use the American {{citizenship}} he had been granted to secure his release, and contacted William Short, United States minister in The Hague. Although Short and other U.S. envoys very much wanted to succor Lafayette for his services to their country, they knew that {{his status as a}} French officer took precedence over <b>any</b> <b>claim</b> to American citizenship. Washington, who was by then president, had instructed the envoys to avoid actions that entangled the country in European affairs, and the U.S. did not have diplomatic relations with either Prussia or Austria. They did send money for the use of Lafayette, and for his wife, whom the French had imprisoned. Secretary of State Jefferson found a loophole allowing Lafayette to be paid, with interest, for his services as a major general from 1777 to 1783. An act was rushed through Congress and signed by President Washington. These funds allowed both Lafayettes privileges in their captivity.|$|E

5|$|Through the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress {{established}} a six-member Supreme Court. The court {{was composed of}} one Chief Justice and five Associate Justices. It was given exclusive original jurisdiction over all civil actions between states, or between a state and the United States, as well as over all suits and proceedings brought against ambassadors and other diplomatic personnel; and original, but not exclusive, jurisdiction over all other cases in which a state was a party and any cases brought by an ambassador. The Court was given appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the federal circuit courts as well as decisions by state courts holding invalid any statute or treaty of the United States; or holding valid any state law or practice that was challenged as being inconsistent with the federal constitution, treaties, or laws; or rejecting <b>any</b> <b>claim</b> made by a party under a provision of the federal constitution, treaties, or laws.|$|E
5|$|Burchard, {{along with}} Marshal {{and other members}} of the chapter, were often opposed to the actions of their {{archbishop}}. They objected to the archbishop having given a large part of York's treasury towards Richard's ransom, and to some of the archiepiscopal appointments in the church of York. Burchard and the others charged Geoffrey with simony, extortion, and neglect of his duties and the archbishop in return excommunicated the ringleaders more than once, and locked the canons out of church. The disputes flared up in 1192, with Burchard facing an effort by Geoffrey to replace him in the treasurership with Hamo, but the dispute was resolved by the gift of a church to Hamo by Burchard and Hamo's relinquishing of <b>any</b> <b>claim</b> to the treasurership. At another dispute, Geoffrey had confiscated the revenues of Burchard's offices, along with the revenues of Marshal, Peter de Ros the Archdeacon of Carlisle, and the canons Hugh Murdac and Adam of Thornover. Geoffrey refused to restore the incomes unless the offenders came barefoot into York Minster and begged for the archbishop's forgiveness. This all but Marshal did and they had their official revenues restored.|$|E
5|$|For {{the motives}} of Bardanes himself, the {{situation}} is less clear. According to the Byzantine chroniclers, he accepted the acclamation only reluctantly, after vainly entreating the soldiers {{to allow him to}} leave. According to another story however, before his revolt, Bardanes, accompanied by his three principal associates, Thomas the Slav, Leo the Armenian and Michael the Amorian visited a holy man at Philomelion to learn of the prospects for the uprising. The monk correctly prophesied that his rebellion would fail, that Thomas too would begin a revolt, and that Leo and Michael would reign as emperors. Although possibly a later invention, this story may suggest that Bardanes planned his revolt beforehand. Aside from any personal ambition, Bardanes was {{also a member of the}} landed aristocracy and a devoted iconophile who supported Empress Irene's regime. He has therefore also been seen as the representative of the opposition by the traditional elites to Nikephoros's policies, both in the confessional area, where the Emperor maintained a carefully neutral stance towards both iconoclasts and iconophiles, and in the socio-financial sphere, where new taxes on landed property and the expropriation of ecclesiastical estates hurt their interests. Historian Warren Treadgold further suggested that the revolt was a reaction against Nikephoros's usurpation and aimed, at least ostensibly, at the restoration of Irene. Her death, however, at Lesbos on 8 August deprived the rebels of <b>any</b> <b>claim</b> to legitimacy.|$|E

5|$|The {{surrender}} of Candia ended the {{four and a}} half centuries of Venetian rule in Crete, and brought the Ottoman Empire to its temporary territorial zenith. At the same time however, the cost and casualties incurred during this prolonged war contributed greatly to the decline of the Ottoman state during the latter 17th century. On the other hand, Venice had lost its greatest and most prosperous colony, its pre-eminent trading position in the Mediterranean had diminished, and its treasury was exhausted, having spent some 4,253,000 ducats on the defense of Candia alone. To all this, the Dalmatian gains were insufficient compensation. Upon his return to Venice in 1670, Morosini was tried on charges of insubordination and treason, but was acquitted. Fifteen years later, he would lead the Venetian forces in the Morean War, where the Republic attempted, for the last time, to reverse its losses and reestablish itself as one of the major powers of the Eastern Mediterranean. During that war, in 1692, a Venetian fleet attempted to retake Candia, but failed. The last Venetian strongholds off Crete fell in the last Turkish–Venetian War in 1715. Crete would remain under Ottoman control until 1897, when it became an autonomous state. The island continued under Ottoman suzerainty until the Balkan Wars. In their aftermath, the Ottoman Sultan dropped <b>any</b> <b>claim</b> on the island, and on 1 December 1913 it was formally united to Greece.|$|E
