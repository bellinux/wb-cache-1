5|$|Nitrogen forms nine {{molecular}} oxides, some {{of which}} were the first gases to be identified: N2O (nitrous oxide), NO (nitric oxide), N2O3 (dinitrogen trioxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), N2O4 (dinitrogen tetroxide), N2O5 (dinitrogen pentoxide), NO3 (nitrogen trioxide), N4O (nitrosylazide), and N(NO2)3 (trinitramide).)3 |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=1145–8 |doi=10.1002/anie.201007047}} All are thermally unstable towards decomposition to their elements. One other possible oxide that has not yet been synthesised is oxatetrazole (N4O), an <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alcohols do not {{normally}} behave as acids in water, but {{the presence of}} a double bond adjacent to the OH group can substantially decrease the pKa by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. Ascorbic acid is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring</b> as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.|$|E
5|$|Manganese(IV) oxide (manganese dioxide, MnO2) {{is used as}} a reagent {{in organic}} {{chemistry}} for the oxidation of benzylic alcohols (where the hydroxyl group is adjacent to an <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring).</b> Manganese dioxide has been used since antiquity to oxidize and neutralize the greenish tinge in glass from trace amounts of iron contamination. MnO2 is also used in the manufacture of oxygen and chlorine and in drying black paints. In some preparations, it is a brown pigment for paint and is a constituent of natural umber.|$|E
50|$|The {{nitrogen}} (N)-containing <b>aromatic</b> <b>rings</b> can {{be separated}} into basic <b>aromatic</b> <b>rings</b> that are easily protonated, and form aromatic cations and salts (e.g., pyridinium), and non-basic <b>aromatic</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Simple <b>aromatic</b> <b>rings</b> can be heterocyclic if {{they contain}} non-carbon ring atoms, for example, oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. They can be {{monocyclic}} as in benzene, bicyclic as in naphthalene, or polycyclic as in anthracene. Simple monocyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>rings</b> are usually five-membered rings like pyrrole or six-membered rings like pyridine. Fused <b>aromatic</b> <b>rings</b> consist of monocyclic rings that share their connecting bonds.|$|R

Compounds of xenon bound to boron, hydrogen, bromine, iodine, beryllium, sulphur, titanium, copper, and silver have also been observed but only at low temperatures in noble gas matrices, or in supersonic noble gas jets.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring.</b> The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} {{involves a}} rearrangement {{that gives a}} new <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{non-basic}} <b>aromatic</b> <b>rings</b> {{the lone}} pair of electrons of the nitrogen atom is delocalized {{and contributes to}} the aromatic pi electron system. In these compounds the nitrogen atom is connected to a hydrogen atom. Examples of non-basic nitrogen-containing <b>aromatic</b> <b>rings</b> are pyrrole and indole.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to catalyzing the hydrolysis {{of the central}} ester bond between the two <b>aromatic</b> <b>rings</b> of digallate (depsidase activity), tannase may also have an esterase activity (hydrolysis of terminal ester functional groups that are attached to {{only one of the}} two <b>aromatic</b> <b>rings).</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the title}} compound, C(12) H(10) N(2) O(3), the oxygen atom {{bridging}} the two <b>aromatic</b> <b>rings</b> is in a synperiplanar (+sp) conformation. The dihedral angle between the <b>aromatic</b> <b>rings</b> is 71. 40 (12) degrees. In the crystal, molecules are linked by intermolecular N-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds...|$|R

25|$|In {{the drug}} {{discovery}} process of a 5-HT2C agonist, a pharmacophore module {{has been used}} to discover novel 5-HT2C receptor ligands. The pharmacophore has four features; one <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring,</b> two hydrophobic features and one positive ionizable feature. Figure 4 shows an example of a compound that fits the agonist pharmacophore perfectly. The nitrogen atom of piperazine fits the positive ionizable feature, the benzofuran part fits the <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring</b> and one hydrophobic, and the trifluoromethane part fits another hydrophobic feature of the pharmacophore.|$|E
25|$|Cyclooctatetraene also {{undergoes}} rearrangement {{reactions to}} form <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring</b> systems. For instance, oxidation with aqueous mercury(II) sulfate forms phenylacetaldehyde and photochemical rearrangement of its mono-epoxide forms benzofuran.|$|E
50|$|Simple <b>{{aromatic}}</b> <b>rings,</b> {{also known}} as simple arenes or simple aromatics, are aromatic organic compounds that consist only of a conjugated planar ring system. Many simple <b>aromatic</b> <b>rings</b> have trivial names. They are usually found as substructures of more complex molecules ("substituted aromatics"). Typical simple aromatic compounds are benzene, indole, and cyclotetradecaheptaene.|$|R
5000|$|Basic <b>aromatic</b> <b>rings</b> are <b>aromatic</b> <b>rings</b> {{in which}} the lone pair of {{electrons}} of a ring-nitrogen atom {{is not part of the}} aromatic system and extends in the plane of the ring. This lone pair is responsible for the basicity of these nitrogenous bases, similar to the nitrogen atom in amines. In these compounds the nitrogen atom is not connected to a hydrogen atom. Basic aromatic compounds get protonated and form aromatic cations (e.g. pyridinium) under acidic conditions. Typical examples of basic <b>aromatic</b> <b>rings</b> are pyridine or quinoline. Several rings contain basic as well as non-basic nitrogen atoms, e.g. imidazole and purine.|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of heterocyclic {{aromatics}} and substituted benzenes, the electronegativity differences between {{different parts of the}} ring may dominate the chemical behaviour of <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring</b> bonds, which otherwise are equivalent.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases where}} the OH {{functional}} group is bonded to an sp2 carbon on an <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring</b> the molecule {{is known as a}} phenol, and is named using the IUPAC rules for naming phenols.|$|E
25|$|Instead of catalyzing the Pictet-Spengler {{cyclization}} {{with strong}} acid, one can acylate the iminium ion forming the intermediate N-acyliminium ion.

25|$|A better {{representation}} {{is that of}} the circular π-bond (Armstrong's inner cycle), in which the electron density is evenly distributed through a π-bond above and below the ring. This model more correctly represents the location of electron density within the <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tertiary amides {{are highly}} {{effective}} directing groups. After {{treatment of the}} resulting benzylic anion with an aldehyde, cyclization leads to lactones.

25|$|The word phenol is {{also used}} to refer to any {{compound}} that contains a six-membered <b>aromatic</b> <b>ring,</b> bonded directly to a hydroxyl group (-OH). Thus, phenols are a class of organic compounds of which the phenol discussed in this article is the simplest member.|$|E
