At the time of publishing of WASP-43b's discovery on April 15, 2011, the planet was the most closely orbiting Hot Jupiter discovered. The small orbit of WASP-43b is thought to be caused by WASP-43's unusually low mass. WASP-43 was first observed between January and May 2009 by the SuperWASP project, and was found to be cooler and slightly richer in metals than the Sun.

We have found that for very <b>active</b> <b>stars</b> the emission widths, both W_ 0 and W_ 1, are larger than expected from previously accepted width-luminosity relations. The stars with strong emission intensities, I_K 3 and large values of Vsin i seem to present larger values of W_ 0 than resulted from WB relation, the effect of the rotational velocity being the most remarkable. On the contrary, W_ 1 is strongly influenced by I_K 3 but the effect of the rotational broadening is lesser. We also analyse the behaviour of the Ca II H and K line parameters in these very <b>active</b> <b>stars</b> in relation with less <b>active</b> <b>stars</b> and we found that the increase of W_ 1 and I_K 1 With I_K 3 presents a flattening for the most <b>active</b> <b>stars</b> which is different for each value of W_ 0.

5|$|The {{constellation}} {{does not}} lie on the galactic plane of the Milky Way, {{and there are no}} prominent star clusters. NGC 625 is a dwarf irregular galaxy of apparent magnitude 11.0 and lying some 12.7 million light years distant. Only 24000 light years in diameter, it is an outlying member of the Sculptor Group. NGC 625 is thought to have been involved in a collision and is experiencing a burst of <b>active</b> <b>star</b> formation. NGC 37 is a lenticular galaxy of apparent magnitude 14.66. It is approximately 42 kiloparsecs (137,000 light-years) in diameter and about 12.9 billion years old. Robert's Quartet (composed of the irregular galaxy NGC 87, and three spiral galaxies NGC 88, NGC 89 and NGC 92) is a group of four galaxies located around 160 million light-years away which {{are in the process of}} colliding and merging. They are within a circle of radius of 1.6 arcmin, corresponding to about 75,000 light-years. Located in the galaxy ESO 243-49 is HLX-1, an intermediate-mass black hole—the first one of its kind identified. It is thought to be a remnant of a dwarf galaxy that was absorbed in a collision with ESO 243-49. Before its discovery, this class of black hole was only hypothesized.|$|E
25|$|The ISM plays {{a crucial}} role in {{astrophysics}} precisely because of its intermediate role between stellar and galactic scales. Stars form within the densest regions of the ISM, molecular clouds, and replenish the ISM with matter and energy through planetary nebulae, stellar winds, and supernovae.

25|$|An {{open cluster}} {{is a group}} of up to a few {{thousand}} stars that were formed from the same giant molecular cloud and have roughly the same age. More than 1,100 open clusters have been discovered within the Milky Way Galaxy, and many more are thought to exist. They are loosely bound by mutual gravitational attraction and become disrupted by close encounters with other clusters and clouds of gas as they orbit the galactic center. This can result in a migration to {{the main body of the}} galaxy and a loss of cluster members through internal close encounters. Open clusters generally survive for a few hundred million years, with the most massive ones surviving for a few billion years. In contrast, the more massive globular clusters of stars exert a stronger gravitational attraction on their members, and can survive for longer. Open clusters have been found only in spiral and irregular galaxies, in which <b>active</b> <b>star</b> formation is occurring.|$|E

During a programme of optical identification of X-ray sources from the ROSAT All-Sky Faint Source Catalogue (1 RXS) (Voges et al. 2000) in the ROTSE 1 database ([URL] /, Wozniak et al., 2004) 25 new chromospherically <b>active</b> <b>stars</b> have been found. The criteria for including a star in this list of chromospherically <b>active</b> <b>stars</b> were, i) the X-ray identification, ii) a suitable period after {{an analysis of the}} NSVS data with Period 04 (Lenz and Breger 2005) and iii) an appropriate B-V colour index (Høg et al. 2000) if available.

Partial information about spectral classifications (Wright et al., 2003) and high proper motions (Ivanov 2007) support the classification as chromospherically <b>active</b> <b>stars.</b> Because of the high absolute magnitudes of pulsating variables with similar light curves (especially Cepheids) their large distances should result in small proper motions.

40|$|We {{suggest that}} the radio {{emission}} from the dwarf nova SS Cyg during outburst comes from magnetic activity that formed a corona (similar to coronae found in magnetically <b>active</b> <b>stars),</b> rather than from jets.

Using observations from the literature we find that for SS Cyg during outburst Lr/Lx< 10 ^{- 5 }. This does not mean jets are not launched during outbursts.
