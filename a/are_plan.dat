5000|$|India {{ratified}} UNCRC on 11 December 1992, agreeing in principles all articles {{except with}} certain reservations on {{issues relating to}} child labor. In India there is law that {{children under the age}} of 18 should not work, but there is no outright ban on child labor, and the practice is generally permitted in most industries except those deemed [...] "hazardous". Although a law in October 2006 banned child labor in hotels, restaurants, and as domestic servants, there continues to be high demand for children as hired help in the home. Current estimates as to the number of child laborers in the country range from the government's conservative estimate of 4 million children under 14 years of age to the much higher estimates of children's rights activists, which hover around 60 million. Little is being done to address the problem since the economy is booming and the nuclear family is spreading, thereby increasing demand for child laborers. In India many people are still suffering from non-nutritious food, many parents are still leaving their children on riverside, in trains etc. Under the auspices of the Unicef financed Odisha initiative the Government of India is specifying the outline of a means of change and improvement in child care, and many trusts such as childLine, Plan India and savethechildren too are taking efforts to outdate child labor from India. A few of the organisations who work with children's rights in India <b>are</b> <b>Plan</b> India, CRY (Child Rights and You), Save the Children, Bal Vikas Dhara-New Delhi, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, CHORD-Hyderabad.|$|E
