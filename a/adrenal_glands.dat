5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> are {{surrounded}} by a fatty capsule and lie within the renal fascia, which also surrounds the kidneys. A weak wall of connective tissue called septum separates the glands from the kidneys. The <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> are directly below the diaphragm, and {{are attached to the}} crura of the diaphragm by the renal fascia.|$|E
5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> {{are located}} {{on both sides of}} the body in the retroperitoneum, above and {{slightly}} medial to the kidneys. In humans, the right adrenal gland is pyramidal in shape, whereas the left is semilunar or crescent shaped and somewhat larger. The <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> measure approximately 3.0cm in width, 5.0cm in length, and up to 1.0cm in thickness. Their combined weight in an adult human ranges from 7 to 10grams. The glands are yellowish in colour.|$|E
5|$|These {{blood vessels}} supply {{a network of}} small arteries within the capsule of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands.</b> Thin strands of the capsule enter the glands, {{carrying}} blood to them.|$|E
40|$|Putrescine is {{the major}} source of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the rat <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland.</b> Diamine oxidase, and not monoamine oxidase, is {{essential}} for GABA formation from putrescine in the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland.</b> Aminoguanidine, a diamine oxidase inhibitor, decreases the GABA concentration in the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> by more than 70 % after 4 h, and almost to zero in 24 h. Studies using [14 C]putrescine confirm that [14 C]GABA {{is the major}} metabolite of putrescine in the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland.</b> Inhibition of GABA transaminase by amino-oxyacetic acid does not change the GABA concentration in the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland,</b> as compared with the brain, where the GABA concentration rises. With aminoguanidine, the turnover time of GABA originating from putrescine in the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> is 5. 6 h, reflecting a slower rate of GABA metabolism compared with the brain. Since GABA in the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> is almost exclusively derived from putrescine, the role of GABA may relate to the role of putrescine as a growth factor and regulator of cell metabolism...|$|R

5|$|Enzymes of {{the smooth}} ER {{are vital to}} the {{synthesis}} of lipids, including oils, phospholipids, and steroids. Sex hormones of vertebrates and the steroid hormones secreted by the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> are among the steroids produced by the smooth ER in animal cells. The cells that synthesize these hormones are rich in smooth ER.|$|E
5|$|Exercise also {{increases}} the respiratory rate, partly {{in response to}} the movement of the limbs detected by proprioceptors in the muscles and joints, an increase in body temperature, the release of adrenaline (epinephrine) from the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands,</b> and from motor impulses originating from the cerebral cortex.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the contrast-enhanced ultrasonographic characteristics and vascular patterns of <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> tumors in dogs and determine whether those features {{are indicative of}} malignancy or histologic type of tumor. Animals: 14 dogs with 16 <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> lesions (10 carcinomas [8 dogs], 3 adenomas [3 dogs], and 3 pheochromocytomas [3 dogs]). Procedures: Unsedated dogs with <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> lesions underwent B-mode ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography <= 48 hours before adrenalectomy; contrast-enhanced ultrasonographic examinations were video-recorded. Macroscopic evaluation of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> lesions and histologic examination of removed <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> tissues were subsequently performed. Surgical and histopathologic findings and the ultrasonographic and contrast-enhanced ultrasonographic characteristics were recorded for the various tumor types. Time-intensity curves were generated from the contrast-enhanced ultrasonographic recordings and used to calculate regional blood volume (value proportional to area under the curve) and mean transit time (time the lesion began to enhance to the half-peak intensity). Results: In <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> carcinomas, tortuous feeding vessels were noticeable during the arterial and venous phases of contrast enhancement. Heterogeneity of contrast enhancement was evident only in malignant tumors. Compared with adenomas, <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> carcinomas and pheochromocytomas had significantly less regional blood volume. Mean transit times were significantly shorter in <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> carcinomas and pheochromocytomas than in adenomas. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: For dogs, evaluation of the vascular pattern and contrast-enhancement characteristics of <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> tumors by means of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography {{may be useful in}} assessment of malignancy and tumor type...|$|R

5000|$|Feline hyperaldosteronism is {{a disease}} in cats. The {{symptoms}} are caused by abnormally high concentrations of the hormone aldosterone, [...] which is secreted by the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland.</b> The high concentrations of aldosterone may be due directly to a disorder of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> (primary hyperadlosteronism), or due to something outside of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> causing it to secrete excessive aldosterone (secondary hyperaldosteronism).|$|R
5|$|Cells in zona reticularis of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> produce male sex hormones, or androgens, {{the most}} {{important}} of which is DHEA. In general, these hormones do not have an overall effect in the male body, and are converted to more potent androgens such as testosterone and DHT or to estrogens (female sex hormones) in the gonads, acting in this way as a metabolic intermediate.|$|E
5|$|Neuroblastoma (NB) {{is a type}} {{of cancer}} that forms in certain types of nerve tissue. It most {{frequently}} starts from one of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands,</b> but can also develop in the neck, chest, abdomen, or spine. Symptoms may include bone pain, a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest, or a painless bluish lump under the skin.|$|E
5|$|Primary lung cancers {{themselves}} {{most commonly}} metastasize to the brain, bones, liver and <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands.</b> Immunostaining of a biopsy is often helpful {{to determine the}} original source. The presence of Napsin-A, TTF-1, CK7 and CK20 are helpful in confirming the subtype of lung carcinoma. SCLC derived from neuroendocrine cells may express CD56, neural cell adhesion molecule, synaptophysin or chromogranin.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of activin A {{and its effects}} have previously been documented in the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland,</b> particularly in the human fetal <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> and the rat <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland.</b> The primary signaling pathway of activin involves interactions between receptor and intracellular (Smad) proteins {{that have not been}} completely described in the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland.</b> In this study, we demonstrate that the components of the activin signaling cascade are present in two complemen-tary models, the fetal rat <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> and the human adrenocortical cell line, H 295 R, by means of RT-PCR, western analysis, and immunoprecipitation techniques. Using the cell line, activin signaling was analyzed using an activin-responsive reporter gene, p 3 TP-luc, and luciferase assays to assess transcriptional activity with co-expression of the different activin receptors and Smads to demonstrat...|$|R
40|$|To the Editor, Non-Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} (NHL) {{is found}} in the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> secondarily at a rate of 25 % [1]. Primary adrenal lymphoma (PAL) {{is found in}} fewer than 1 % of NHL cases [2]. Secondary <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> involvement is usually unilateral, while PALs are usually bilateral [3, 4]. Primary <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> lymphomas are usually diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) [1, 5]. Most cases are of B-cell origin [4].

5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> (also {{known as}} suprarenal glands) are {{endocrine}} glands that produce {{a variety of}} hormones including adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol. They are found above the kidneys. Each gland has an outer cortex which produces steroid hormones and an inner medulla. The adrenal cortex itself {{is divided into three}} zones: zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> may {{not develop}} at all, {{or may be}} fused in the midline behind the aorta. These are {{associated}} with other congenital abnormalities, such as failure of the kidneys to develop, or fused kidneys. The gland may develop with a partial or complete absence of the cortex, or may develop in an unusual location.|$|E
5|$|In captivity, females become {{sexually mature}} at {{two months of}} age. The ovarian {{follicle}} forms about 16 days prior {{to the birth of}} the offspring. After mating, female hamsters typically have larger uteri, ovaries, and <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> compared to females which live alone, with other females or those that have not mated. The females and males may fight each other when getting to know their partner. Also, these females have a shorter gestation period, around four to five days.|$|E

50|$|Absent <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> {{is a rare}} {{condition}} {{where the}} <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> is absent at birth. It {{should not be confused}} with adrenal insufficiency or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, where the gland is present but may not be functioning adequately.|$|R
5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> are {{composed}} of two heterogenous types of tissue. In the center is the adrenal medulla, which produces adrenaline and noradrenaline and releases them into the bloodstream, {{as part of the}} sympathetic nervous system. Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a variety of steroid hormones. These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal development paths. The cortex of the adrenal gland is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the neural crest, which is of ectodermal origin.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{symptoms}} of lung cancer (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific. In many people, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site {{by the time they}} have symptoms and seek medical attention. Symptoms that suggest the presence of metastatic disease include weight loss, bone pain and neurological symptoms (headaches, fainting, convulsions, or limb weakness). Common sites of spread include the brain, bone, <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands,</b> opposite lung, liver, pericardium, and kidneys. About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiography.|$|E
5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> in {{a newborn}} baby are much larger as a {{proportion}} of the body size than in an adult. For example, at age three months the glands are four {{times the size of the}} kidneys. The size of the glands decreases relatively after birth, mainly because of shrinkage of the cortex. The cortex, which almost completely disappears by age 1, develops again from age 4–5. The glands weigh about 1 g at birth and develop to an adult weight of about 4 grams each. In a fetus the glands are first detectable after the sixth week of development.|$|E

These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Domesticated rats have {{a longer}} {{lifespan}} than that of wild rats. Because domesticated rats are protected from predators and have ready access to food, water, shelter, and medical care, their average lifespan is around two to three years, in contrast to wild R. norvegicus which average a lifespan of less than one year. However, wild rats generally have larger brains, hearts, livers, kidneys, and <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> than laboratory rats. The fancy rat and wild rat also both face a multitude of differing health concerns; the former is at risk of developing a pneumococcal infection from exposure to humans, while the latter may harbor tapeworms after coming in contact with carriers like cockroaches and fleas.|$|E
