Radio talks, interviews, discussions, situation and subject based programmes, musical concerts, songs (folk, classical, geet, ghazals), dramas, sports, humorous programmes, and so on depict the diversity of collection. Radio/TV Libraries in India need a reliable software ensuring safe 2 ̆ 6 secure storage and reliable, fast and accurate retrieval of desired audio/video content. Moreover, there should be a mechanism to play the content, simultaneous upon its retrieval without losing any time. So the software should envisage instant and live linkage to such digital files from the database itself. A database was created using the MS Access 2007 Database Management System. Tables, queries, forms, macros, methods and procedures have been designed and developed to ensure reliable storage and fast/accurate retrieval of information. Digital files of songs have been stored outside the database linked to corresponding records in the database so that upon retrieval the particular song can be played instantly. The database can easily be operated in a networked atmosphere on client server mode of communication. The software will act as a reliable solution for development of an <b>audio</b> <b>visual</b> digital <b>library</b> of Hindustani film music...|$|R

40|$|Keywords: effectiveness, <b>audio</b> <b>visual,</b> {{vocabulary}} achievement. One {{of media}} {{which can be}} used in teaching vocabulary is <b>audio</b> <b>visual</b> media. <b>Audio</b> <b>visual</b> media is a media that involves the senses of hearing and sight at once in one process. In teaching vocabulary using <b>audio</b> <b>visual</b> media, the teacher plays the vocabulary disc using laptop and LCD projector. Using this media, the students are able to see the objects in the form of pictures, and the spelling of the objects name. In addition, the students are also able to listen the way to pronounce the words which they learn. As a result, they can understand and memorize the vocabularies well. The formulation of the research problems were: 1) How is the students’ achievement in vocabulary before they are taught using <b>audio</b> <b>visual</b> as the teaching media? 2) How is the students’ achievement in vocabulary after they are taught using <b>audio</b> <b>visual</b> as the teaching media? 3) Are there any significant different scores before and after being taught using <b>audio</b> <b>visual</b> media? The objectives of this research were to: 1) know the students’ achievement of vocabulary before they are taught using <b>audio</b> <b>visual</b> as the teaching media, 2) know the students’ achievement of vocabulary after they are taught using <b>audio</b> <b>visual</b> as the teaching media, 3) find out significant different scores before and after being taught using <b>audio</b> <b>visual</b> as the teaching media. Research Method: 1) the research design in this study was pre-experimental design with quantitative approach in the form of one-group pre-test and post-test design, 2) the population of this study was all students of the fifth year students at SDN 2 Nglongsor-Trenggalek, 3) the samples were the fifth year students at SDN 2 Nglongsor-Trenggalek consisting of twenty students, 4) the research instrument was test, 5) the data analysis was using t-test. The result showed that the students’ score before they are taught using <b>audio</b> <b>visual</b> media was 68. 4. While the students’ score after they are taught using audio visula media was 82. In addition, the result of the statistical computation using t-test revealed that the obtained tcount was 10. 93. Then the t-table for t 0. 01 was about 2. 54, and the t- table for t 0. 05 was about 1. 73. Hence, the calculated value (10. 93) was much larger than the t-tables (t 0. 05 = 1. 73 and t 0. 01 = 2. 54). It means that the null hypothesis stated that teaching vocabulary using <b>audio</b> <b>visual</b> as the teaching media was not effective to improve the students’ achievement of vocabulary was rejected. Whereas, the alternative hypothesis stated that teaching vocabulary using <b>audio</b> <b>visual</b> as the teaching media was effective to improve the students’ vocabulary achievement was accepted. In other words, <b>audio</b> <b>visual</b> media can be used as an alternative to teach vocabulary to the students at elementary school level...|$|R
