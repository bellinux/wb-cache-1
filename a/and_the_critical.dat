5|$|Prince of Wales and Repulse {{were the}} first capital ships to be sunk solely by naval air power on the open sea (albeit by {{land-based}} rather than carrier-based aircraft), a harbinger of the diminishing role this class of ships was to play in naval warfare thereafter. It is often pointed out, however, that contributing factors to the sinking of Prince of Wales were her surface-scanning radars being inoperable, depriving Force Z {{of one of its}} most potent early-warning devices <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> early damage she sustained from the first torpedo. Another factor which led to Prince of Waless demise was the loss of dynamos, depriving Prince of Wales of many of her electric pumps. Further electrical failures left parts of the ship in total darkness, and added to the difficulties of her damage repair parties as they attempted to counter the flooding.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{disease is}} marked by the {{problems}} of capillary permeability (an allowance of fluid and protein normally contained within blood to pass) and disordered blood clotting. These changes appear associated with a disordered state of the endothelial glycocalyx, which acts as a molecular filter of blood components. Leaky capillaries (<b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> phase) {{are thought to be}} caused by an immune system response. Other processes of interest include infected cells that become necrotic—which affect both coagulation and fibrinolysis (the opposing systems of blood clotting and clot degradation)—and low platelets in the blood, also a factor in normal clotting.|$|E
