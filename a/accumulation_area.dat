40|$|Himalayan glaciers {{are being}} {{extensively}} debated in scientific and public forums, as {{changes in their}} distribution can significantly affect the availability of water in many rivers originating in the region. The distribution of glaciers can be influenced by mass balance, {{and most of the}} glaciers located in the Pir Panjal and Greater Himalayan mountain ranges are losing mass at the rate of almost a meter per year. The Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) has also shifted upward by 400 m in the last two decades. This upward migration of ELA and the loss in mass could have been influenced by changes in temperature, precipitation and by the deposition of black carbon in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>area</b> of glaciers. The deposition of black carbon can reduce the albedo of snow in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>area</b> leading to faster melting of snow and causing more negative mass balance. In this investigation, a change in reflectance in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>area</b> of the Baspa basin is analysed for the year 2009, as the region has experienced extensive forest fires along with northern Indian biomass burning. The investigation has shown that: (1) The number of forest fires in the summer of 2009 was substantially higher than in any other year between 2001 and 2010; (2) the drop in reflectance in the visible region from April to May in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>area</b> was significantly higher in the year 2009 than in any other year from 2000 to 2012; (3) the temperature of the region was substantially lower than the freezing point during the active fire period of 2009, indicating the small influence of liquid water and grain size; (4) the drop in reflectance was observed only in the visible region, indicating role of contamination; (5) in the visible region, a mean drop in reflectance of 21 ± 5 % was observed during the active fire period in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>area.</b> At some places, the drop was as high as 50 ± 5 %.

The WKM region consists of 537 glaciers (> 0. 02 km 2) with a total area of 3137 km 2 in 2013. Out of these, 16 groups of glaciers covering an area about 1234 km 2 (2013) showed varying surface elevation trends ranging from - 0. 4 ± 0. 20 m/a to 0. 7 ± 24 m/a over 2003 - 2008, except the serious thinning trend (- 1. 15 ± 0. 41 m/a) detected at a surging glacier. The surging glacier (the Zhongfeng glacier) is characterized by drastic elevation variations (up to - 80 m) and contrasting trends over the <b>accumulation</b> <b>areas</b> due to cave-in and rapid transfer of ice to the downstream.
