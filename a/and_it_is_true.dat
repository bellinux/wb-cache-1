25|$|While a few {{writers and}} {{researchers}} {{have tried to}} assign such a retrospective diagnosis to Turing, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> that he had his share of eccentricities, the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film – social awkwardness, difficulty working cooperatively with others, and tendency to take things too literally – bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing, who, despite enjoying working alone, was sociable and had friends, was also viewed as having a sense of humour, and had good working relationships with colleagues.|$|E
25|$|He was {{conservative}} by nature, and {{his life}} was spent in defending the Reformed theology as {{set forth in the}} Westminster Confession of Faith and Larger and Westminster Shorter Catechisms. He was fond of saying that Princeton had never originated a new idea; but this meant no more than that Princeton was the advocate of historical Calvinism in opposition to the modified and provincial Calvinism of a later day. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> that Hodge must be classed among the great defenders of the faith, rather than among the great constructive minds of the Church. He had no ambition to be epoch-making by marking the era of a new departure. But he earned a higher title to fame in that he was the champion of his Church's faith during a long and active life, her trusted leader in time of trial, and {{for more than half a}} century the most conspicuous teacher of her ministry. Hodges' understanding of the Christian faith and of historical Protestantism is given in his Systematic Theology.|$|E

In my judgment the people of no nation can lose their liberty so long as a Bill of Rights like ours survives and its basic purposes are conscientiously interpreted, enforced, and respected... I would follow what I believe was the original intention of the Fourteenth Amendment—to extend to all the people the complete protection of the Bill of Rights. To hold that this Court can determine what, if any, provisions of the Bill of Rights will be enforced, and if so to what degree, is to frustrate the great design of a written Constitution.|$|E

In the Islamic world at the time, the credit for a building's design was usually given to its patron rather than its architects.

Shah Jahan's court histories emphasise his personal involvement in the construction <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> that, more than any other Mughal emperor, he showed the greatest interest in building, holding daily meetings with his architects and supervisors.

[...] Two architects are mentioned by name, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri and Mir Abd-ul Karim in writings by Lahauri's son Lutfullah Muhandis. Ustad Ahmad Lahauri had laid the foundations of the Red Fort at Delhi. Mir Abd-ul Karim had been the favourite architect of the previous emperor Jahangir and is mentioned as a supervisor, together with Makramat Khan, of the construction of the Taj Mahal.|$|E
