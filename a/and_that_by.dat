5|$|A later La Brea pits study {{compared}} tooth breakage of dire {{wolves in}} two time periods. One pit contained fossil dire wolves dated 15,000YBP and another dated 13,000YBP. The {{results showed that}} the 15,000YBP dire wolves had three times more tooth breakage than the 13,000YBP dire wolves, whose breakage matched those of nine modern carnivores. The study concluded that between 15,000–14,000YBP prey availability was less or competition was higher for dire wolves, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> 13,000YBP, as the prey species moved towards extinction, predator competition had declined and therefore the frequency of tooth breakage in dire wolves had also declined.|$|E

5|$|Investigators {{initially}} {{assumed that}} the arsenic used to poison the victims had come from rat poison, but when common adulterants used in rat poison {{failed to show up}} in autopsies, they were forced {{to come up with a}} new theory. It was unlikely that the illiterate sisters would have been able to acquire arsenic through the usual method of visiting a chemist, a route more open to doctors than spinsters. Eventually it was discovered that common flypaper at the time contained arsenic, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> soaking the flypaper in water, a solution substantially identical – including the same adulterants – to that found in a bottle at the Higgins residence could be obtained.|$|E

5|$|The {{charge on}} {{electrons}} and protons is opposite in sign, hence {{an amount of}} charge may be expressed as being either negative or positive. By convention, the charge carried by electrons is deemed negative, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> protons positive, a custom that originated {{with the work of}} Benjamin Franklin. The amount of charge is usually given the symbol Q and expressed in coulombs; each electron carries the same charge of approximately −1.6022×10−19coulomb. The proton has a charge that is equal and opposite, and thus +1.6022×10−19 coulomb. Charge is possessed not just by matter, but also by antimatter, each antiparticle bearing an equal and opposite charge to its corresponding particle.|$|E

5|$|A 2004 study {{into the}} effect of The Daily Show on viewers' attitudes found that {{participants}} had a more negative opinion of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry.

While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> following the show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.|$|E

5|$|Afterward, the PSC {{largely ignored}} the lease plan {{since it was}} still focused on {{building}} {{the first phase of}} the Dual Contracts. The Flushing Business Men's Association kept advocating for the Amity Street subway, causing a schism between them and the rest of the groups that supported the LIRR lease. Through the summer of 1915, the PSC and the LIRR negotiated the planned lease to $125,000 a first year, , with an eight percent increase each year; the negotiations then stalled in 1916. The Whitestone Improvement Association, impatient with the pace of negotiations, approved of the subway under Amity Street even though it would not serve them directly. The PSC's chief engineer wrote in a report that a combined 20,600 riders would use the Whitestone and Bayside lines each day in either direction, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> 1927, there would be 34,000 riders per day per direction. The Third Ward Rapid Transit Association wrote a report showing how much they had petitioned for Flushing subway extensions to that point, compared to how little progress they had made in doing so. Negotiations continued to be stalled in 1917. Despite the line not having been extended past Corona yet, the idea of a subway extension to Little Neck encouraged development there.|$|E

He further added that the car's performance issues could be traced back to a lack of outright power and poor fuel efficiency from the engine. Éric Boullier, the team principal, further suggested that the main problem that the team faced was improving the efficiency of the RA615H's energy recovery systems, both in harvesting and deploying the additional power, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> developing these areas, the car could make up several seconds on lap time, enough for the car to compete regularly for podium finishes.|$|E

Ferris is surrounded by a group of SUVs, which circle him to create an obscuring dust cloud before picking him up. The dust cloud blocks Hoffman's view, so that he cannot determine which of the SUVs, now headed in different directions, is carrying Ferris. Ferris is taken across the border to Syria where he is to be interrogated by Al-Saleem. When Ferris asks Al-Saleem about Aisha, he is told that someone has lied to him and that he has been double-crossed. Ferris tells Al-Saleem that there is an infiltrator (Karami) in his organization who works for Ferris, <b>and</b> <b>that,</b> <b>by</b> association, Al-Saleem works for Ferris.
