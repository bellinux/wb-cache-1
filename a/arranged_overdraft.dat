50|$|In February 2009, Halifax made {{significant}} changes {{to its current}} accounts. From then, all new standard current accounts had zero credit and debit interest, along with no paid and unpaid item charges (which were previously up to £35, Halifax has replaced their basic 'Easycash' account with the 'Basic Account'. They have no unpaid charges and replace all VISA Electron cards with VISA DEBIT cards. They also align themselves with all other Halifax current accounts with an increased ATM daily withdrawal limit of £500. Instead, all overdraft-eligible Halifax 'Standard current account' customers pay £1 per day for being overdrawn by up to £1999.99 within an <b>arranged</b> <b>overdraft,</b> and £2 per day for up to £2999.99 and £3 per day for over £3000.00. For unarranged overdrafts the fee is £5 per day. Credit interest {{has been replaced by}} a £5 net payment every month if customers abide by the terms of the 'Reward current account'. These changes were implemented to all current account customers (except student accounts) from December 2009. These changes caused a great deal of media attention at the time of the change, with Martin Lewis and consumer magazine Which? urging Halifax customers to keep their accounts in credit wherever possible, or consider moving their accounts to an alternative bank, in response to the new charges.|$|E
50|$|When banks {{crashed in}} the 1890s the Hospital Board had its money locked up {{and as a}} result was forced to <b>arrange</b> <b>overdraft.</b> Despite this by 1897 the Hospital Board was in a {{position}} to employ its first trained nurse, Miss Alice Kemp and in 1900 as a response to a Queensland Government requirement that Boards take positive action Dr Neilson was appointed health officer at a cost of £25. Despite the hospital having been in operation since the late 1860s it was not until 1902 that the deeds to the land were received.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, but what? It must be {{something}} good this time. I don't want to be walking along Broadway and come on you suddenly as a street-cleaner. I don't want to send for an express-man and find you popping up. My idea would be {{to go to my}} bank to <b>arrange</b> an <b>overdraft</b> and be told the president could give me two minutes and crawl in humbly and find you prezzing away to beat the band in a big chair. Isn't there anything in the world that you can do that's solid and substantial and will keep you out of the poor-house in your old age? Think!" ...|$|R
50|$|After the WWII, the Fanling {{property}} had badly {{suffered from}} general neglect which was understandable in the circumstances. The trees {{had been cut}} down for fuel {{and parts of the}} course including most of the greens had been used for vegetable cultivation. The New Course had been used for training and a large number of fox holes had been built. The clubhouse was requisitioned by the British Army after the war. The rehabilitation was as expensive as had been forecast. The Club not only spent all its account balances but had to <b>arrange</b> for an <b>overdraft</b> which at one time was over $400,000. (The price of daily newspaper in Hong Kong was 20 cents in 1947/48.) To reduce this liability a debenture issue was authorised on the basis of HK$500 per member. A few of the long established firms such as the Hong Kong Bank and Jardines also took up a number of the debentures to aid the Club. In 1963, an EGM was called and a Fanling Development Scheme was approved. Two resolutions were passed authorising the Committee to proceed with a scheme for the extension of the Fanling clubhouse and the issue of debentures to the amount of HK$900,000 to cover the costs. A building levy of HK$5 per month for all members was also introduced. Actual and estimated capital expenditure on the improvement to the clubhouse totalled HK$1,214,000. In early 1970s, to raise capital for the new complex, including the swimming pool and the mixed accommodation, a scheme of Nominee Memberships was introduced. On payment of HK$5,000 - soon raised to HK$10,000 - a firm became entitled, after approval by the Club, to nominate an employee to membership. The Nominee Memberships were transferable, again subject to the Club's approval, on payment of a commission to the Club. At the AGM in 1980, it was decided to issue 30 Nominee Memberships to meet the expense of a redevelopment scheme to include a swimming pool and squash courts in Deep Water Bay. The new building at Deep Water Bay was completed in early 1983 {{at a cost of about}} HK$25 million. The financial problems were eventually overcome. Following many years of loss, a profit was reported in 1984 for the third year running. Since then, the Club has remained in the black.|$|R
