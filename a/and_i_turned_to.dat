500|$|Baywatch and Knight Rider star David Hasselhoff {{accepted}} the role when his daughters, Taylor-Ann and Hayley, urged him: [...] "I got {{an offer to}} do a cameo in the SpongeBob Movie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> my girls, who were like 16 and 14, and I said, 'Who's SpongeBob?' and they said, 'Oh my God, Dad, it's the number one cartoon in the world, you gotta do it.'" [...] Hasselhoff enjoyed his cameo: [...] "It was great fun {{and to this day}} around the world kids stop me and say, 'Are you David Hasselhoff?' because I was the only human in the picture." [...] Hasselhoff said that the film gained him new fans: [...] "It's amazing - so many of the kids were so young and didn't see Baywatch and Knight Rider so I got a whole new legion of fans." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 15:04 {{my flight}} was {{attacked}} by three MiGs, two from the ‘10 o’clock’ and one from the ´6 o’clock´. Initially I didn’t see this last one because I had been concentrating on those approaching head-on. My WSO excitedly warned me about this rapidly approaching MiG, which was within firing range of my #3 and #4. I hesitated a while before interrupting my attack against the two MiGs in front, because I had seen the ‘Olds’ flight passing below us a few seconds before. I thought that the plane seen by my WSO {{could be one of}} them. Despite that, I suddenly turned left and then right, and caught sight of the third MiG. I ordered to my numbers 3 and 4 to break right. [...] As they did so, the MiG broke left for some mysterious reason and for a split second we were side by side. [...] We were so close that, besides the red stars in his wings, I could clearly see the pilot’s face. [...] I began a horizontal barrel roll to get away from him and into an attack position, once in position, I launched a Sidewinder. [...] The missile missed because the evading MiG broke left at full throttle. [...] But when he did it, he put himself {{in the line of fire}} of my number 2, Captain Everett T. Raspberry. [...] I ordered him to follow the prey, because the two aircraft that I initially saw had been placed in my forward sector. [...] I was in an advantageous position, so I fired two AIM-9s against them in a quick sequence, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> place myself as wingman of my #2, Captain Raspberry. [...] I kept on descending besides Captain Raspberry and I remember that I thought that he was still out of the optimal launching envelope. But he performed a barrel roll that placed him in a perfect position again and he launched an AIM-9 which hit against the tail section of the MiG-21. It was shaken violently and later fell in a slow, almost plane spin.|$|E
60|$|She {{slipped her}} hand into mine <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> lead her away.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not all. But {{you are a}} part of it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{you because}} you are a more tangible, sensible, {{responsible}} cause than the others." ...|$|R
60|$|The three {{younger men}} looked happier {{at the moment}} as they seemed to realize the {{significance}} of her words. But Van Helsing <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> each other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at the time, however.|$|R
60|$|He went reluctantly {{into the}} house, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> again <b>to</b> my audience.|$|R
60|$|Joshua {{declined}} argument, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> watch Oliver, who {{had covered}} {{his face with his}} hands, and seemed to be weeping.|$|E
60|$|Gussie popped along, {{flapping}} {{the telegram}} and {{looking like a}} close-up of Joan Crawford, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Jeeves {{and gave him a}} précis of my operations.|$|E
6000|$|I {{helped her}} into the cab. [...] "Good-bye," [...] I said with a weak {{affectation}} of an everyday separation, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the cabman with her instructions.|$|E
5000|$|Muslims {{believe that}} they, {{as well as}} {{everyone}} else, are vulnerable to making mistakes and thus they need to seek repentance repeatedly at all times. Muhammad said [...] "By Allah (God), I seek the forgiveness of Allah <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> Him in repentance more than seventy times each day." [...] (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 6307) ...|$|R
60|$|She {{had sunk}} {{into one of}} the golden thrones, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> her she greeted me with a wan smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my honour, no," [...] {{he assured}} her. [...] "I must stay {{here a little}} longer, {{whatever}} it may mean for me. <b>And</b> so <b>I</b> am content to remain what I am to you at this minute. I ask from you only that you remain just what you are. But when the moment of my freedom comes, when my task here is finished <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> go, then <b>I</b> must come to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said I, as {{the train}} {{moved out of the}} station, [...] "That's all over!" [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Marion--a little {{unfamiliar}} still, in her unfamiliar clothes--and smiled.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is your {{remarkable}} little friend doing?" [...] asked a {{voice behind}} me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> find Mary Cavendish at my elbow. She smiled, {{and so did}} I. [...] "What is it all about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{was sitting}} still beside me, Dozing likewise; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> her, {{to take her}} hanging hand; When, the more regarding, that which like a spectre shook and tried me [...] In her image then I scanned; ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Come on, officer,' says I, dignified. 'I {{may as well}} {{make the}} best of it.' <b>And</b> then <b>I</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> old Banks <b>and</b> rattles my chains.|$|R
60|$|Behind me, with a wild cry, Mary Cavendish fell heavily against me, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> {{catch her}} <b>I</b> met the quiet triumph in Poirot's eyes.|$|R
60|$|That and the {{speedometer}} were both {{on my side}} of the cabin, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> take a reading from the former I could see Perry muttering.|$|R
6000|$|Two of them unfurled {{a banner}} between poles which bore the legend: 'The Earth is flat.' Woodhouse <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Bat. He shook his head. 'No, no! Not me.... If I had only seen their costumes in advance!' ...|$|E
60|$|And {{giving me}} the sort of weak smile Roman gladiators used to give the Emperor before {{entering}} the arena, Gussie trickled off. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Jeeves. The moment had arrived for putting him in his place, and I was all for it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hamlet!" [...] was {{suddenly}} proclaimed, {{in the clear}} sweet tones I knew so well. The croaking all ceased in a moment, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the stage, in some curiosity to see what Bruno's ideas were as to the behaviour of Shakespeare's greatest Character.|$|E
60|$|It {{was that}} that filled up {{the cup of}} my misery to overflowing. I loved the man well: <b>and</b> <b>I</b> must <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{denounce}} him.|$|R
5000|$|... "It's his home. It's all {{normal to}} him that there's a train running around the {{property}} tooting its horn," [...] the director recalled of a noisy interruption that appears among the DVD's bonus features. [...] "time his staff brought us soup, so we were sipping soup and talking, and these two elephants walk by outside. Michael's continuing to sip his soup like a fly flew by, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> Michael <b>and</b> {{look at him and}} he's not even acknowledging the elephants." ...|$|R
6000|$|I gazed awhile [...] On {{her cold}} smile; [...] Too cold-too cold for me-- [...] There passed, as a shroud, [...] A fleecy cloud, [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> away <b>to</b> thee, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's this?" [...] said a gruff {{voice at}} my elbow; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> face the huge, black-bearded Dragoon who had dragged {{me from my}} saddle. [...] "Look at the Frenchman crying! I thought that the Corsican was {{followed}} by brave men and not by children." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Prince. Therefore take it {{and hide}} it in the safest and most secret place in the palace, and with it these pearls that are too priceless to be flaunted about the streets of Memphis at night, unless indeed----" [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> look for Amada, but she was gone.|$|E
60|$|Something in {{his tone}} caught my ear, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> look at him. An {{extraordinary}} change had come over his face. It was writhing with inward merriment. His two eyes were shining like stars. It {{seemed to me that}} he was making desperate efforts to restrain a convulsive attack of laughter.|$|E
60|$|I {{gave him}} a nod, as much {{as to say that}} it would all come right in the future, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Charlie again. He was {{beginning}} to pick up.|$|R
60|$|We {{heard him}} close the outer door <b>and</b> depart. Then <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Louis.|$|R
5000|$|We wrote a lot {{of stuff}} together, one on one, eyeball to eyeball. Like in 'I Want to Hold Your Hand,' I {{remember}} when we got the chord that made the song. We were in Jane Asher's house, downstairs in the cellar playing on the piano at the same time. And we had, 'Oh you-u-u/ got that something...' And Paul hits this chord <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> him <b>and</b> say, 'That's it!' I said, 'Do that again!' In those days, we really used to absolutely write like that — both playing into each other's noses.|$|R
6000|$|The {{chairman}} {{looked at}} my face and his jaw dropped. [...] "I declare this meeting closed," [...] he said, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> hurry from the platform, whereat there went up a shout of [...] "No, no." [...] It sank to a sudden silence, and again {{the man with the}} face of fate spoke.|$|E
6000|$|I now thought enough {{had been}} laid in on my own account, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> see what the captain was about. He was higgling for a bale marked [...] "Opinions on the Lost Condition of the Monikin Soul." [...] A little curious to know why he had made this selection, I led him aside, and frankly put the question.|$|E
6000|$|I confess this terrified {{me again}} another way, and I {{began to be}} {{sensible}} that, if anybody had been near me to understand English, I had been undone. The thought of shooting myself forsook me from that time; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> William, [...] "You disorder me extremely, William," [...] said I; [...] "why, I am never safe, nor {{is it safe to}} keep me company. What shall I do? I shall betray you all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'But he is ill, {{and this}} place is hardly fit for him. There are no comforts, and we could {{take better care of}} him,' said the younger one, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> round <b>to</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hate you," [...] she said, <b>and</b> then, as <b>I</b> {{was about}} to beg for a fair hearing she pointed over my shoulder. [...] "The thipdar comes," [...] she said, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> again <b>to</b> meet the reptile.|$|R
6000|$|But when I got {{him into}} his bunk he again {{buried his face in}} his hands, {{covering}} his eyes, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> go <b>I</b> could hear him murmuring, “I am a sick man, a very sick man.” ...|$|R
