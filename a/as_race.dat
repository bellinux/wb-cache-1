5|$|The team's {{two leaders}} Vinokourov and Kreuziger rode {{strongly}} at the Ardennes classics. Vinokourov took fourth in La Flèche Wallonne, six seconds back of winner Philippe Gilbert. Kreuziger was also fourth, {{at the fourth}} monument Liège–Bastogne–Liège, and also back of Gilbert <b>as</b> <b>race</b> winner. The team also sent squads to the E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke, Gent-Wevelgem, and the Amstel Gold Race, but finished distantly in each, 16th, 66th, and 17th respectively.|$|E
5|$|About a {{month after}} the race concluded, reports began {{surfacing}} which stated that Giro director Angelo Zomegnan was going to be ousted from that position. Though praised for his delicate handling of Weylandt's death, Zomegnan's handling of the teams' protest of and eventual removal of the Monte Crostis from the Giro race route was seen much less approvingly. A further month later, RCS Sport, owners of the race, confirmed that Zomegnan had been removed from his largely autocratic position <b>as</b> <b>race</b> director. He was replaced by RCS general director Michele Acquarone and Mauro Vegni, along with a team of former professional riders. Zomegnan remains as an RCS consultant and director of the 2013 UCI Road World Championships in Florence. Zomegnan had held the position since 2004, beginning with the 2005 Giro d'Italia.|$|E

5|$|Martin {{moved into}} the top ten {{positions}} by lap 122, as Gordon fell down to fourteenth four laps later. On lap 134, Johnson moved back on track, however he returned to pit road eight laps later as the green flag pit stop period began. Hamlin gained the lead on lap 146. After pit stops, Kyle Busch reclaimed the first position. Drivers reported track conditions were changing as cooler air came over the circuit by lap 148. Jeff Gordon reported seeing debris at turn one on the 165th lap, which triggered the third caution. Some of the leaders chose to make pit stops during the caution <b>as</b> <b>race</b> officials cleaned the debris. Kyle Busch maintained his lead at the restart, ahead of Kurt Busch and Earnhardt.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the major}} musical {{organizations}} in Baltimore were founded by musicians who trained at the Peabody Institute's Conservatory of Music. These include Baltimore Choral Arts, Baltimore Opera Company (BOC), and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (BSO). These organizations all have excellent reputations and sponsor numerous performances throughout the year. Baltimore has produced a number of well-known modern composers of classical and art music, most famously including Philip Glass, a minimalist composer and Christopher Rouse, a Pulitzer winner. Glass {{grew up in the}} 1940s, working in his father's record store in East Baltimore, selling African American records, then known <b>as</b> <b>race</b> music. He was there exposed to Baltimore jazz and rhythm and blues.|$|E
5|$|Round Hill's elevated, fairly central {{position}} gives excellent {{inward and}} outward views. To the northeast, the South Downs can be seen; long {{views of the}} English Channel are possible to the south, beyond the city centre and St Peter's Church; to the southeast, Elm Grove, Race Hill and Brighton General Hospital {{can be seen on}} high ground beyond the Lewes Road valley; and to the west, Preston Park (the city's oldest and largest public park) can be seen. Crescent and Wakefield Roads have long southward views towards the city centre, as do the small blocks of flats which replaced some large villas {{in the middle of the}} suburb. The tall viaduct is the main landmark to the west and north. There are clear views into Round Hill from many parts of Brighton, especially areas to the east and southeast such <b>as</b> <b>Race</b> Hill.|$|E

5|$|Space Race was {{the first}} arcade racing video game, {{as well as the}} first game with a goal of {{crossing}} the screen while avoiding obstacles, though a few racing games had been released in 1972 for the Magnavox Odyssey home video game console. Later games in that genre are the arcade game Frogger and the Atari 2600 Freeway, both from 1981. A similarly-titled, expanded version of Space Race was published by ANALOG Software in 1981 for the Atari 8-bit family of computers <b>as</b> <b>Race</b> in Space.|$|E
5|$|The game's fifteen tracks—four {{of which}} are {{available}} immediately—are based on conventional video game environments such as jungles, volcanoes, and cities. After completing a track for the first time, the player unlocks a time trial mode for this track, and a boss battle. The action-oriented boss battles involve defeating a generally static Digimon using items scattered throughout the areas, which are not designed <b>as</b> <b>race</b> tracks. The player can also compete in single races unrelated to the story in any unlocked tracks. The game uses the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter or Game Link Cable accessories for a multiplayer racing mode supporting up to four players.|$|E
5|$|The {{season was}} one of the best in the team's history, with 20 {{victories}} and a Tour de France with multiple noteworthy performances. Team leader Thomas Voeckler wore the yellow jersey <b>as</b> <b>race</b> leader for ten days; the second such occurrence of his career, after also leading for ten days in 2004. Unlike that race, however, Voeckler poised himself as a serious overall contender and took fourth place overall; the best result by a French rider since 2000. While he spent most of the Tour riding in Voeckler's service, Pierre Rolland won one of the marquee stages, up Alpe d'Huez, eventually finishing 11th overall and winning the young rider classification.|$|E

5|$|To address criticisms {{levelled}} at Blyton's work some later editions {{have been}} altered to reflect more liberal attitudes towards issues such <b>as</b> <b>race,</b> gender {{and the treatment}} of children; modern reprints of the Noddy series substitute teddy bears or goblins for golliwogs, for instance. The golliwogs who steal Noddy's car and dump him naked in the Dark Wood in Here Comes Noddy Again are replaced by goblins in the 1986 revision, who strip Noddy only of his shoes and hat and return {{at the end of}} the story to apologise.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Robinson {{was drafted}} and {{assigned}} to a segregated Army cavalry unit in Fort Riley, Kansas. Having the requisite qualifications, Robinson and several other black soldiers applied for admission to an Officer Candidate School (OCS) then located at Fort Riley. Although the Army's initial July 1941 guidelines for OCS had been drafted <b>as</b> <b>race</b> neutral, few black applicants were admitted into OCS until after subsequent directives by Army leadership. As a result, the applications of Robinson and his colleagues were delayed for several months. After protests by heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis (then stationed at Fort Riley) and the help of Truman Gibson (then an assistant civilian aide to the Secretary of War), the men were accepted into OCS. The experience led to a personal friendship between Robinson and Louis. Upon finishing OCS, Robinson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in January 1943. Shortly afterward, Robinson and Isum were formally engaged.|$|E
5|$|One lap later, Daniil Kvyat {{suffered}} a heavy impact at the penultimate corner, causing another safety car period. Both Hamilton and Vettel used this to change tyres again, as did Button on lap 45. The safety car {{came back in}} {{at the end of}} lap 46, with the order being: Rosberg, Hamilton, Verstappen, Vettel, Alonso, Pérez, Button and Maldonado. At the restart, Verstappen tried to move past Hamilton but failed and was in turn overtaken by Vettel. On lap 48, Nico Rosberg lost the lead to Hamilton after sliding off track due to wheelspin in his rear tyres. The German later declared that his mistake was caused by a strong gust of wind. Hamilton soon opened up a gap to his teammate, while Jenson Button moved up into sixth ahead of Alonso on lap 50, but lost the position again to Sainz {{before the end of the}} race. His teammate Alonso had been running fifth, but a loss of power from his engine moved him down the order to eventually finish eleventh. In the closing laps, Vettel edged closer to Rosberg in second, but was unable to overtake. This meant that Hamilton, who crossed the line <b>as</b> <b>race</b> winner, also took his third career championship title, with both Vettel and Rosberg now too far behind.|$|E
