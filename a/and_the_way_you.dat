500|$|In an {{interview}} with Q magazine, lead singer Chris Martin stated that [...] "In My Place" [...] was a song Coldplay had left after recording their debut album Parachutes (2000). When the band finished recording their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head, Martin said that the album was complete. However, after guitarist Jonny Buckland played the song on his guitar, Martin said that they now needed to record it and include it on the album. Martin also said that: [...] "That's about where you're put in the world, and how you're given your position, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> look, and how {{you have to get}} on with it." [...] In {{an interview}}, Buckland revealed that the song was hard to record, as the band had played the song live. He also commented that when they started recording the song, they did not know how it should sound, due to the band members' contrasting ideas.|$|E
500|$|While filming The Deceivers in Rajasthan, India, in 1987, Brosnan's wife Harris became seriously ill. She {{was later}} {{diagnosed}} with ovarian cancer and died on 28 December 1991 at age 43. Brosnan struggled {{to cope with}} her cancer and death. [...] "When your partner gets cancer, then life changes. Your timetable and reference for your normal routines <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> view life, all this changes. Because you're dealing with death. You're dealing {{with the possibility of}} death and dying. And it was that way through the chemotherapy, through the first-look operation, the second look, the third look, the fourth look, the fifth look. Cassie was very positive about life. I mean, she had the most amazing energy and outlook on life. It was and is a terrible loss, and I see it reflected, from time to time, in my children." [...] Harris had always wanted Brosnan {{to play the role of}} James Bond, and in 1995, four years after her death, Brosnan was given the role in GoldenEye.|$|E
500|$|Due to the father-son {{dynamics}} of the hunting world depicted in the series' first season with the Winchesters, the writers decided to explore a mother-daughter relationship. This resulted in {{the introduction of the}} character Jo Harvelle and her mother Ellen, though the Alex character was eventually renamed Jo. Tal had been a fan of the show, and decided to audition for the role. Since the character was not fully explored during her first few appearances on the show, Tal did not know what her personality would be. Because of the way Jo is introducedthreatening Dean with a rifleTal {{was under the impression that}} the character was an experienced hunter. With this in mind, she decided to portray her as [...] "somewhat confident and cool" [...] by making use of her experience in the Israeli army, where she served for two years. Tal commented, [...] "When I was in the army I was holding my gun and feeling all dangerous and badass. It's an attitude, it's a different kind of walk, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> hold yourself, the way you look at things. I tried to put that in there because she didn't say much." ...|$|E

500|$|In April2011, it was {{reported}} that Masood would kidnap Yusef, pour petrol on him and threaten to set him on fire. Yusef will then go to the Masood's house and tell Zainab what Masood has done. An EastEnders insider told the News of the World, [...] "Masood has never got over that. Tension has been simmering for a while and leads to an outpouring of violence from Masood that leaves Yusef seriously injured. But Yusef will get his own back. It is a twisted love triangle that will also show the sometimes brutal side of arranged marriages. It's not clear if their marriage will survive Yusef's meddling. [...] Yusef obviously wants [...] back and will do anything he can to drive a wedge between Masood and Zainab." [...] Ganatra said that Yusef will turn [...] "very manipulative and very nasty" [...] and Masood finds him as a big threat saying, [...] "He throws a real spanner in the works for Masood. [...] He is doing everything he can to wreck Masood's life, really, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> do that is to get to his family. It's a very clever way of doing things—it's not about destroying his family, it's about winning his family and turning them against him, so that Masood is left isolated and on his own." [...] Ganatra spoke of the storyline saying, [...] "I think there's rumours of revenge! Yusef is a really nice catalyst - he's a very exciting character to throw into the mix. If it goes that way, it's more drama for us to play." [...] The scenes were broadcast on 2June2011 with Phil Mitchell also taking revenge alongside Masood.|$|E

The Thing is well-paced, designed with an excellent variety of levels [...] Everything {{is consistent with the}} movie, the theme of which has been handled with exquisite care and thought. With the exception of the blood test goofs and the rather thin storyline, The Thing warrants your time and money." [...] Steve Polak scored the PC version 8.5 out of 10, writing [...] "The Thing is for the most part an immersive and enjoyable game. The visuals and sound are top notch and the sense of desperation you feel when you are stuck outside and about to succumb to the elements or being hunted by packs of the foul creatures is very real. The squad based elements <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> keep your men from losing their minds also adds to the depth of the play experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|With Texas and California both {{vying for}} {{a spot in the}} Rose Bowl, Brown {{received}} criticism for lobbying on behalf of his team, which many perceived was a factor in UT's Rose Bowl invitation. Cal was denied what would have been their first Rose Bowl bid since 1958. [...] "I thought it was a little classless how Coach Brown was begging for votes," [...] Cal quarterback Aaron Rodgers told reporters in Berkeley. [...] "I think a team's record <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> play should speak for itself." [...] Cal's only loss was a 23–17 nailbiter on the road at USC. Cal dominated the game statistically, more than doubling USC in total yardage. The Golden Bears had a first-and-goal from the 9-yard-line with roughly one minute left in the fourth quarter, but could not convert. Meanwhile, Texas' lone loss was a 12–0 defeat to Oklahoma on a neutral field. USC and Oklahoma, the teams Cal and Texas lost to, respectively, went on to play in the national championship. USC blew out Oklahoma 55–19 in that game. However, Texas fans point to the Holiday Bowl, where Cal was dealt a 45–31 loss at the hands of No. 23 Texas Tech, a team which Texas defeated 51–21 earlier in the season.|$|E
