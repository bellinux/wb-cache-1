For each class, a specific <b>attack</b> <b>vector</b> is described here.

25|$|Rootkits {{employ a}} variety of {{techniques}} to gain control of a system; the type of rootkit influences the choice of <b>attack</b> <b>vector.</b> The most common technique leverages security vulnerabilities to achieve surreptitious privilege escalation. Another approach is to use a Trojan horse, deceiving a computer user into trusting the rootkit's installation program as benignin this case, social engineering convinces a user that the rootkit is beneficial. The installation task is made easier if the principle of least privilege is not applied, since the rootkit then does not have to explicitly request elevated (administrator-level) privileges. Other classes of rootkits can be installed only by someone with physical access to the target system. Some rootkits may also be installed intentionally by the owner of the system or somebody authorized by the owner, e.g. for the purpose of employee monitoring, rendering such subversive techniques unnecessary. The installation of malicious rootkits is commercially driven, with a pay-per-install (PPI) compensation method typical for distribution.|$|E
25|$|One {{disadvantage}} of this feature {{is that the}} computers which are actually performing the calculations might not be entirely trustworthy. The designers of the system must thus introduce measures to prevent malfunctions or malicious participants from producing false, misleading, or erroneous results, and from using the system as an <b>attack</b> <b>vector.</b> This often involves assigning work randomly to different nodes (presumably with different owners) and checking {{that at least two}} different nodes report the same answer for a given work unit. Discrepancies would identify malfunctioning and malicious nodes. However, {{due to the lack of}} central control over the hardware, there is no way to guarantee that nodes will not drop out of the network at random times. Some nodes (like laptops or dial-up Internet customers) may also be available for computation but not network communications for unpredictable periods. These variations can be accommodated by assigning large work units (thus reducing the need for continuous network connectivity) and reassigning work units when a given node fails to report its results in expected time.|$|E

500|$|Disturbance errors (explained in {{the section}} above) {{effectively}} defeat various layers of memory protection by [...] "short circuiting" [...] them at a very low hardware level, practically creating a unique <b>attack</b> <b>vector</b> type that allows processes to alter the contents of arbitrary parts of the main memory by directly manipulating the underlying memory hardware. [...] In comparison, [...] "conventional" [...] attack vectors such as buffer overflows aim at circumventing the protection mechanisms at the software level, by exploiting various programming mistakes to achieve alterations of otherwise inaccessible main memory contents.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, the Soviet Navy takes {{steps to}} protect its {{ballistic}} missile submarine fleet in coastal waters behind minefields and ASW assets, freeing up its attack submarines to engage and destroy NATO shipping. Thus, the Soviet Navy is able {{to act as an}} offensive weapon contrary to pre-war NATO expectations, becoming a major strategic threat against resupply convoys coming from North America with both aircraft and submarines. This advantage is put to immediate use as a NATO carrier battle group, led by USS Nimitz, [...] and the French carrier Foch, is successfully attacked by Soviet Badger and Backfire bombers, the latter firing Kingfish missiles. The Soviet Badgers fire modified Kelt missiles as decoys whose radar transmitters make them appear to be Backfires on the predicted <b>attack</b> <b>vector,</b> far out from the main air fleet. The American carriers' F-14 interceptors are committed against the decoys, leaving an insufficient number of Crusaders from the Foch and the ships' surface-to-air missiles to defend against the 'real' Backfires approaching from another direction. A few of the Backfires and most of their Kingfish missiles are shot down by the F-8 Crusaders, the Aegis missile cruisers, the destroyers whose surface-to-air missiles can guide on the AEGIS radar signals, and the Phalanx antimissile gun systems, but some of the Kingfish get through. The Foch is sunk, the amphibious assault carrier [...] explodes, taking 2,500 Marines with her, and the USS Nimitz damaged, with the two American carriers forced to spend several weeks under repair, Nimitz at Southampton, England and Saratoga at Norfolk, Virginia. Toland, who narrowly survived the bombing of the USS Nimitz, is reassigned to Stornoway. Meanwhile, the Soviets engage in an aerial battle over northern Norway, depleting the Royal Norwegian Air Force. They eventually capture the Andøya Rocket Range, bringing strategically key NATO radar and air stations in Scotland within range of sustained air attack. At Toland's advice, NATO decides to use air force for an offensive rather than defence of Scotland, using Soviet radio communications to their advantage. Meanwhile, Edward Morris is aboard the USS Pharris, when it is severely damaged with massive casualties after a hit from a Soviet torpedo. This leaves Morris struggling to cope with nightmares and intense stress, but he is nonetheless reassigned to the frigate [...]|$|E
