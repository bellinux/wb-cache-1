The <b>alcohol</b> <b>precipitate</b> yields varied from 21. 68 % to 32. 67 % (%dw/dw) depending on the pH. At pH 2, the <b>alcohol</b> <b>precipitate</b> yields and the uronic acid recovery from extract juice are higher than those obtained at pH 1. 5. Other compounds than ulvan such as cellulose, hemicellulose, proteins and ash are solubilized from the cell walls of Ulva lactuca at both pH, and they are precipitated with alcohol. The <b>alcohol</b> <b>precipitate</b> obtained from different extraction conditions has high uronic acid (20. 37 %- 23. 60 %) and neutral sugar content (20. 09 %- 29. 12 %), especially when the conditions (pH, temperature) are drastic. It contains rhamnose (13. 35 %- 15. 59 %), glucose (2. 90 %- 10. 97 %), and xylose (2. 36 %- 2. 73 %). A decrease in the molecular weight of ulvan was observed at acid pH, and for long extraction times. The presence of proteins (1. 94 %- 2. 32 %) and inorganic material (33. 36 %- 47. 15 %) in <b>alcohol</b> <b>precipitate</b> prove the lower purity of ulvan extracted and shows that ulvan precipitation with ethanol is not specific. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{influence}} of extraction condition (pH: 1. 5 to 2; temperature: 80 to 90 degrees C; extraction time: 1 to 3 h), on the yield and purity of apple pomace pectin without elimination of impurities by alcohol washing was carried out. The <b>alcohol</b> <b>precipitate</b> yields varied from 2. 9 % to 8. 9 % depending on the pH. At pH 1. 5, these yields were higher than those obtained at pH 2 contrary to the galacturonic acid purity (%w/w). Compounds other than pectins were solubilized from the cell walls of apple pomace at pH 1. 5, and they were precipitated with alcohol. The apple pectins obtained from the different extraction procedures were highly methylated (54. 5 % to 79. 5 %), especially when the conditions (temperature, pH) were drastic. Similar conclusions can be drawn for the neutral sugar content that decreased at pH 1. 5 (arabinose, xylose, and galactose) or at the highest temperatures and extraction times (arabinose and galactose). The phenomenon of demethylation and pectin degradation of neutral sugars chains can be observed at acid pH, and long extraction times. The presence of high quantities of mannose or fructose, glucose, and xylose in the <b>alcohol</b> <b>precipitate</b> showed that pectin precipitation with ethanol was not specific.

40|$|The <b>alcohol</b> <b>precipitate</b> (70 – 90 %) {{prepared}} from a {{water extract}} of Harding-Passey mouse melanomas contained a melanoma melanocyte cell-cycle inhibitor. The incorporation of 14 C-thymidine into the DNA of melanocytes {{was used as}} a measure of DNA synthesis by melanocytes and it appears to be valuable as a parameter of melanocyte proliferation. A single injection of melanoma extract into the peritoneal cavity of mice bearing Harding-Passey mouse melanoma caused 35 – 65 percent reduction of 14 C-thymidine incorporation into the DNA of melanoma melanocytes. An in vitro assay method using 8 – 16 mouse melanoma melanocytes in tissue culture was established. Addition of melanocyte extract to the tissue culture medium containing adrenalin and hydrocortisone caused a reduction of mitotic index, of incorporation of 14 C-thymidine into DNA, and of 3 H-leucine incorporation into melanocyte protein. The inhibition of DNA and protein biosynthesis due to the melanocyte extract was well correlated. For inhibition of the melanocyte extract, which resembles epidermal chalone in activity, the presence of adrenalin and hydrocortisone was required. A procedure is described consisting of ethanol fractionation, gel filtration, and column chromatography which results in considerable purification of the melanoma melanocyte specific mitotic inhibitor. The biologically active material of the melanoma extract appears to consist of two different fractions; fraction II, which is heat labile and tissue nonspecific and consists mainly of protein with a molecular weight of 30, 000 – 35, 000, and fraction IV 2 which is heat labile and tissue specific and consists of protein and RNA.

40|$|Abstract Epilepsy is {{a diverse}} disease {{consisting}} of several different types and subgroups. The pathophysiology can also differ {{between the different}} types, and in many cases, the pathophysiology is not fully known. There are several factors influencing the clinical picture of the patients, amongst others, seizure precipitating factors. This review focuses on precipitating factors for epileptic seizures, and alcohol specifically. The knowledge about <b>alcohol</b> as a <b>precipitating</b> factor on epileptic seizures is not extensive. It is therefore necessary to address the pathophysiology behind epilepsy, how alcohol will interact with the CNS, and finally if and how <b>alcohol</b> will <b>precipitate</b> epileptic seizures. There is not enough material in the literature to draw definite conclusions, but one can see tendencies on basis of the information we have. Alcohol will interact with the physiology of the CNS and may cause seizures. In {{the end of this}} review, there is also a small clinical trial of 20 patients in the Neurologic Outpatients Clinic at Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet. They underwent a questionnaire and answered questions about their disease and seizures and whether they experienced <b>alcohol</b> as a <b>precipitating</b> factor.

Within 24 hours, the Watson-Schwartz test became positive in 16 of these 32 patients (50 %). In 8 out of the 34 patients (23. 5 %) a clinical attack was precipitated, including both patients who had a positive Watson-Schwartz test prior to the alcohol.

40|$|Mycelial and yeast-phase culture filtrates {{prepared}} {{from three}} strains of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis exhibited equal reactivity in sensitized guinea pigs. Ethyl alcohol-precipitated fractions {{obtained from the}} culture filtrates also showed no difference in reactivity between mycelial and yeast phase when tested in sensitized guinea pigs. Chemical analyses of the ethyl alcohol-precipitated fractions revealed the presence of seven aliphatic amino acids in both the mycelial- and yeast-phase products.

Both the mycelial- and yeast-phase ethyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>precipitated</b> fractions contained 2 to 4 % nitrogen, but no protein or nucleic acid could be detected. Removal of nitrogen from the ethyl alcohol-precipitated fractions by chloroform extraction resulted in an almost complete loss of skin reactivity, whereas the material recovered from the chloroform, which contained most of the nitrogen, still exhibited almost as much reactivity as was present prior to extraction. A considerable portion of the reducing substances was removed along with the nitrogen by the chloroform extraction, suggesting a strong chemical link between the carbohydrate and the peptide portions of the active moiety.

40|$|Bovine seminal plasma (BSP) {{contains}} four similar acidic proteins, previously {{designated as}} BSP-AI, BSP-A 2, BSP-A 3, and BSP- 30 -kDa. These proteins are secreted by the seminal vesicles and coat {{the surface of}} the spermatozoa after ejaculation. The binding site of BSP proteins on the sperm surface has been identified as choline phospholipids on the plasma membrane. This study was undertaken to determine whether BSP proteins modulate capacitation of bovine spermatozoa induced by heparin. Bovine epi-didymal spermatozoa were washed and incubated in buffer containing BSP proteins and then washed and incubated with heparin. The percentage of capacitated spermatozoa was determined under the microscope after the acrosome reaction has been initiated with the addition of lysophosphatidylcholine. The results demonstrated that epididymal sperm undergo the acrosome reaction only in the presence of BSP proteins. This effect was concentration-dependent and reached a maximum level of a 3 - 5 -fold increase at 20 - 40 g/ml BSP protein concentrations. In contrast, ribonuclease (purified from bovine seminal fluid) or seminal fluid proteins depleted of BSP proteins (by sequential absorption of BSP proteins on gelatin-Agarose and DEAE-Sephadex columns) showed no significant potentiating activity. The purified BSP proteins were more active than crude <b>alcohol</b> <b>precipitates</b> of bovine seminal plasma.

We present a new nucleic acid-based method for {{detection of}} cyanobacteria in water that utilizes the same paramagnetic solid phase (beads) for both bacterial cell concentration and subsequent DNA purification. In the cell concentration step, the beads were attracted to a magnet after cell adsorption (in an alcohol- and salt-containing solution), and the supernatant was removed. For DNA purification, a buffer containing guanidine thiocyanate and Sarkosyl lysed the concentrated cells. The addition of <b>alcohol</b> <b>precipitated</b> the released DNA onto the same solid phase as {{was used for the}} cell concentration. Finally, to remove PCR inhibitors, the DNA was washed twice in alcohol while bound to the beads. All of the bead-DNA complex was used in the subsequent PCR amplification. The detection limit, as measured by 16 S rDNA PCR amplification, was 50 cells in a 0. 5 -ml water sample, which is considerably lower than the limit (500 cells/ml) of toxic cyanobacteria tolerated in drinking water (New South Wales Blue-Green Algae Task Force, 1992). Testing of water from natural habitats showed a detection limit in the same range as that for the defined samples. The detection limits and the simplicity of the method (paramagnetic beads can be handled in automated systems) suggest that our method is suitable for routine environmental monitoring...|$|R

The d-valine was a Hoffmann-La Roche product which gave theoretical nitrogen and optical rotation values. The solubilities, which are given in Curve 1 of Fig. 1, were obtained by permitting a supersaturated solution which was prepared by dissolving the product at temperatures higher than those given on the curve to cool at the indicated temperatures.

The production {{was carried out in}} submerged fermentation and subsequently purified using the following three procedures: alcohol precipitation, Q-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography and ultrafiltration. The studies of fructooligossacaride production were carried out in a batch stirred reactor using sucrose as the substrate and 5 U(TF) mL(- 1) of fructosyltransferase at pH 4. 5 and 50 degrees C. Since the industrial application of this enzyme does not require a highly purified enzymatic solution, the enzyme kinetics were comparatively performed using both partially purified (only <b>alcohol</b> <b>precipitated</b> enzyme) and purified (using all steps specified above) enzyme. The kinetics showed a characteristic Michaelis-Menten behavior with substrate inhibition effects at high sucrose concentrations (up to 70 % w/v). Additionally, glucose competitive inhibition relating to the sucrose, 1 -kestose and nystose uptakes were verified. An inhibitory effect was also noticed with high concentrations of fructose (over 50 %) but considered meaningless since the fructose concentration is always low in the actual medium reaction. The hydrolyzing activity over nystose was found to be significant, so it was included in the mathematical model. The initial values for the kinetic constants, K(m), V(m) and K(i), for each substrate were obtained, and then fine-tuned by simulations, after a parameter sensitivity analysis was carried out. The model predictions fitted well the experimental data, either for the purified or partially purified enzyme, while a different set of adjusted parameters was used in each case.

The present study was performed to fmd a simple and reliable method for clinical use, and the following results were obtained. 1. Kaolin adsorption, becaus e of its reliability and practibility, is a method of choice for extraction of gonadotropin from urine. 2. But, even in this method, ther e are some faults that procedure is rather complicated and the yield of gonadotropin is influenced to some extent by the quality of kaolin. 3. The process of extraction has become simple by use of crude kaolin. T h ere is no substantial difference in extraction, be the kaolin crude or purified. 4. Synthetic weak alkaline ion exchanger resin which i s of more uniform quality comparing to kaolin, are recommended for extraction. 5.

40|$|Persil Çetinkol, Özgül (Dogus Author) In the {{biochemical}} {{conversion of}} lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels, {{the process of}} pretreatment is currently {{one of the most}} difficult and expensive operations. The use of ionic liquids (ILs) in biomass pretreatment has received considerable attention recently because of their effectiveness at decreasing biomass recalcitrance to subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. In addition, ILs have the potential for decreasing the need for corrosive or toxic chemicals and associated waste streams that can be generated by other pretreatment methods that utilize acids and/or bases. In this article, we address two significant challenges to the realization of a practical IL pretreatment process. First, we describe a mixture containing specific proportions of a ketone and an <b>alcohol</b> that <b>precipitates</b> cellulose and lignocellulosic biomass from solutions of the IL 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate without the formation of intermediate gel phases. Second, an IL recovery process is described that removes lignin and most residual IL solutes and that minimizes energy and solvent use. These two techniques are demonstrated by the pretreatment of 100 g of corn stover with the recovery of 89 % of the initial IL and separate corn stover fractions rich in glucans, xylans, lignin, and non-polar substances.

Method: Individuals with alcohol dependence (n = 32) completed a randomized, single-blinded, intravenous alcohol administration in the laboratory in which subjective responses to the alcohol were measured, followed by a visit to the laboratory 1 month later to complete the DAQ. Results: Analyses revealed robust as sociations between DAQ scores and alcohol craving during alcohol administration (partial correlations: r =. 43 -. 50, ps <. 01), {{with the exception of the}} positive reinforcement subscale (r = 20, p =. 30). Subjective intoxication and sedation were only associated with the negative reinforcement subscale of the DAQ (r =. 38, p <. 05 and r =. 33, p <. 05, respectively). Conclusions: Craving, captured by the DAQ, is reliably and positively associated with alcohol-induced craving. The DAQ is also associated with specific dimensions of subjective responses to alcohol. These results support the clinical utility of the DAQ, particularly in large samples where experimental manipulations may not be feasible...|$|R
5000|$|In 1964, at Rockefeller Institute (now {{known as}} Rockefeller University), Dole and Nyswander {{initially}} treated six addicts {{during the first}} year, but {{the results of this}} work [...] "were sufficiently impressive to justify the trial of maintenance treatment of heroin addicts admitted to open medical wards of general hospitals in the city." [...] By 1967 over 300 patients were receiving daily doses of methadone, a potent synthetic opioid with an especially long half-life. [...] "After the patients had reached the stabilization level (80 to 120 mg/day methadone) it was possible to maintain them with a single, daily, oral ration, without further increase in dose." [...] Dole's patients not only largely stopped heroin use, they expressed an interest in family, friends, work, and becoming fully engaged members of society once more. Though psychiatrists were available counseling was not mandatory. Dole found that the shift of priorities from daily drug-cravings and the endless quest to keep the abstinence syndrome at bay restored to these individuals an inherent sense of self-worth; they resumed family responsibilities as well as employment. The doctors noted that although methadone satisfied the physical cravings of heroin addiction, patients soon became completely tolerant to its effects. Patients would remain [...] "dependent" [...] on methadone but could otherwise live normally. [...] Habituation results from exposure to any stimulus for long enough. The body always strives for homeostasis or balance, which is why the sudden withdrawal of methadone, morphine, <b>alcohol,</b> cigarettes, <b>precipitates</b> what is called the withdrawal abstinence syndrome.|$|R
40|$|Adolescents who {{abuse or}} are {{dependent}} on alcohol often have coexisting mental disorders. These disorders may both <b>precipitate</b> <b>alcohol</b> use disorders and result from them. In addition, both types of disorders may arise independently in adolescents at high risk. Mental disorders that commonly co-occur with alcohol use disorders in adolescents include antisocial disorders, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders. Treatment programs for adolescents with alcohol use disorders should seek not only to eliminate alcohol and other drug use but also to improve the symptoms of other mental disorders. KEY WORDS: antisocial personality disorder; emotional and psychiatric depression; AODD (alcohol and other drug use disorder); affective psychosis; comorbidity; dual diagnosis; adolescent; psychiatric care; addiction care; patient assessment; treatment method; literature review Adolescents with alcohol use disorders (AUDs) (e. g., alcoholabuse or dependence 1) have high rates of coexisting (i. e., comor-bid) psychopathology (i. e., mental disorders other than alcohol and other drug use disorders). Common comorbid psychopathologies include those that interfere with social functioning (e. g., antisocial disorders) and disorders that cause severe depression or increase anxiety (i. e., negative-affect disorders...|$|R
40|$|Recent reports {{suggest an}} {{association}} between Chlamydia pneumoniae and Helicobacter pylori bacteria and atherosclerosis. We studied 51 patients (mean age, 68. 3 years) who underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery. For each patient we performed a microimmunofluorescence test for immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM antibodies to C. pneumoniae specific antigen (TW- 183). Anti-H. pylori antibodies were determined {{by means of an}} EIA-G test. Each aortic aneurysm surgical specimen was sampled into multiple sections of 0. 3 cm 2 each and frozen at - 20 degrees C. Two samples of each aneurysm were used for a nested PCR with two sets of C. pneumoniae and two sets of H. pylori specific primers. Specimens were treated with a solution containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, Tween 20 -Nonidet P- 40 (0. 5 % [vol/vol] each), and 100 micrograms of proteinase K per ml and incubated at 60 degrees C for 1 h and at 98 degrees C for 10 min. DNA was extracted twice with phenol-chloroform-isoamylic <b>alcohol</b> and <b>precipitated</b> with sodium acetate-ethanol by standard methods. Forty-one patients were seropositive for C. pneumoniae with past-infection patterns in 32 patients (16 or = 512). In 26 of 51 patients, C. pneumoniae DNA was detected in aortic aneurysm plaque specimens. Of these patients, 23 had a serologic past-infection pattern, 2 had an acute reinfection pattern, and 1 was seronegative. Forty-seven of 51 patients were seropositive for H. pylori. In all cases PCR showed no evidence of H. pylori presence in plaque specimens. This study provides data on a possible C. pneumoniae involvement in the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysm and additional evidence for {{an association between}} this agent and atherosclerosis. Conversely, notwithstanding a high H. pylori seroprevalence observed, our results tend to rule out the possibility of a direct involvement of H. pylori in atherosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|Because {{determinations}} of hepatic total choles-terol {{are frequently}} needed, an automated, con-tinuous-flow method {{would be useful}} to have available. Hepatic total cholesterol is extracted with isopropyl alcohol in one step and the extract is then quantitatively analyzed by an accepted AutoAnalyzer procedure for serum total choles-terol. Homogenization of the tissue eliminates the use of proteolytic enzymes or KOH for the diges#{ 149 } tive process. The one-step extraction of total cholesterol with isopropyl <b>alcohol</b> simultaneously <b>precipitates</b> interfering proteins. Addition of FeCI 3 color reagent to an aliquot of clear extract pro-duces a stable color with a density proportional to the amount of cholesterol present, which can be quantitatively detected by a colorimeter and re-corded on a graphic recorder. This automated method eliminates tedious, time-consuming pro. cesses, and can greatly increase the reliability and accuracy of hepatic total cholesterol deter-minations. This method is shown to be rapid, reproducible, and simple. The procedure is adapted for both wet tissueand lyophilized sam-ples, the latter giving slightly more reproducible results. Additional Keyphrases AutoAnalyzer #{ 149 }tissue ex-traction with isopropyl alcohol #{ 149 }FeC 13 color reagent for cholesterol #{ 149 }human and rat hepatic tissue The increasing number and frequency of hepatic cholesterol analyses in experiments on laboratory animals and on clinical materials emphasize the need for a rapid, precise, and reproducible method. Several methods now used (1 - 4) require a time-consuming digestion of liver tissue with either pro-teolytic enzyme or concentrated KOH solution; an extensive and tedious extraction with one or more organic solvents; filtration of the supernatant fluid; evaporation of solvent; and, after the residue is re-constituted in the proper solvent, colorimetric measurement.

30|$|A {{calibrated}} dilatometer with {{a volume}} of 3.594  mL made of heat-resistant glass was put into a water jacket equipped with a UT- 15 thermostat. The temperature of heat carrier (distilled water) was controlled with a TL- 6 thermometer (measuring accuracy ± 0.1  °C). The volume change was measured with a KM- 6 cathetometer (measuring accuracy ± 0.001  mm). The passed time of the reaction was measured with a stopwatch. The accuracy of time measurement does not exceed 1  s during 30  min. To prepare the solution of monomer, 0.05  mol of monomeric complex, 5  mL of dimethylformamide, and 2, 2 ′-azo-bis(isobutyronitrile) in amount of 1 % w/w were put into a beaker and stirred until complete dissolution. The homogeneous solution thus obtained was transferred into the dilatometer with a long funnel. The dilatometer was attached to a vacuum pump and an argon tank by a three-way stopcock. The cooled dilatometer was firstly vacuumized and then filled with argon. This procedure was carried out three times. Prepared dilatometer filled with argon was sealed, and the reference point was set with the cathetometer at 20.0  °C. Afterwards, the dilatometer was put into the water jacket (the temperature of heat carrier was maintained at 80.0  °C) and the contraction of the solution was monitored with cathetometer. The time reading was started {{in a few minutes}} after the initial thermal expansion of liquid had finished. The stopwatch’s readings were taken in 1 – 5 -min increments depending on the rate of contraction. After the polymerization had been completed, the dilatometer was taken out from the water jacket and put into ice-cold water. Its content was quantitatively transferred into a beaker with isopropyl <b>alcohol</b> to <b>precipitate</b> the polymeric complex. The precipitate was filtered off on a glass filter # 16 and dried in a vacuum dryer at 40  °C to a constant mass.|$|R
