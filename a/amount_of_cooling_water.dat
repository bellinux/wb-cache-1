40|$|In the {{finishing}} mill, steel strip is rolled from thick slabs through pairs of rollers {{housed in a}} continuous train of seven roll stands. As the strip is rolled, unwanted lateral movement, known as strip tracking, can cause the strip to collide {{with the edge of}} the mill. Strip tracking control is currently a manual operation, relying on the skill of the operators. When tracking is observed, the stand tilt is adjusted asymmetrically, causing a camber in the strip, steering it towards the centreline. Tracking control can be automated if a reliable measurement of position is available. A vision-based system was developed to measure strip position. <b>Cooling</b> <b>water,</b> steam, high temperatures and electrical noise create a hazardous environment for electronic equipment and hamper image analysis. Hardware was specified to protect all equipment against the environment. A novel image analysis method combining predictive elements, filtering and Bezier curve fitting was created to allow measurements to be made with large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> obscuring the strip edges. The measurement system was designed to integrate with the existing mill systems, using the OPC protocol for communication. The system was created as a development system with only two cameras included, but allowed for additional cameras to be easily added and automatically detected. The results of the system showed that the image analysis techniques were effective, providing an estimated final resolution of 3. 5 mm/pixel, with measurements ± 2 mm within 60 % confidence. Hardware performance provided good protection of the equipment against the environment but poor quality installation limited overall system performance. A computer model was developed to simulate tracking behaviour in the mill with non-linear variations of strip properties across the strip. The model was not completed to a satisfactory standard capable of producing useful results but the theories described could be developed further.

25|$|Decay heat {{accidents}} are where the heat {{generated by the}} radioactive decay causes harm. In a large nuclear reactor, a {{loss of coolant accident}} can damage the core: for example, at Three Mile Island a recently shutdown (SCRAMed) PWR reactor was left for a length <b>of</b> time without <b>cooling</b> <b>water.</b> As a result, the nuclear fuel was damaged, and the core partially melted. The removal of the decay heat is a significant reactor safety concern, especially shortly after shutdown. Failure to remove decay heat may cause the reactor core temperature to rise to dangerous levels and has caused nuclear accidents. The heat removal is usually achieved through several redundant and diverse systems, and the heat is often dissipated to an 'ultimate heat sink' which has a large capacity and requires no active power, though this method is typically used after decay heat has reduced to a very small value. The main cause of release of radioactivity in the Three Mile Island accident was a pilot-operated relief valve on the primary loop which stuck in the open position. This caused the overflow tank into which it drained to rupture and release large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> radioactive <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> into the containment building.|$|R

30|$|Based on {{the results}} {{presented}} in Table  4, {{it is observed that}} the minimum total cost (Ct) and amounts of cooling water (mw) with heating integration of the fluidized catalytic cracking process are less than those obtained without heating integration. Also, it is noticed that the cost saving is (34.87 %) in comparison with the cost obtained without heating integration to reach reaction temperature and to minimize the final product temperature. To achieve the target final temperature of the product (26  °C), it is noticed that the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> needed to reach the final temperature without heat integration is larger than that used with heating integration due to the heat recovery. The energy requirement is also taken into account in this work and shown in Table  4. It has been noted that the energy saving obtained here is about 48 % compared with those without heat integration. Such result gives a clear indication that the CO 2 emissions will be reduced by 48 %, which has the added benefit of significantly reducing environmental impact.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This Bachelor thesis {{has been}} written at the Blekinge Institute of Technology. The thesis {{describes}} electricity production in Shoaiba Steam Power plant in Saudi Arabia. Shoaiba Power Plant is located 100 km South of Jeddah city in Saudi Arabia. Total power production ability reaches 4400 MW. Shoaiba Power Plant has two stages and is constructed with 11 units, each unit produces 400 MW at line voltage 24 kV and line current 16 kA. Main pieces of equipment and their function in the station are as follows: A Steam Generator (boiler), produces steam by burning natural gas or crude oil in the furnace. The steam is superheated and is passed into a steam turbine, which converts the thermal energy of the steam into mechanical power, in form of rotary motion. The turbine drives a generator, which converts the rotary energy of the turbine into electric power. Steam generator, steam turbine and electrical generator are components that are described in the thesis. When the flow of steam to the turbine is controlled, then the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> thermal energy that changes to mechanical energy in the steam turbine is controlled. The electrical generator is where the final energy conversion takes place. The mechanical energy from the turbine is converted by the generator into electrical energy, which is transmitted to the service area by help of electrical transmission lines. The plant cycle {{is an essential part}} of the energy flow path. Without the plant cycle, the conversion of thermal energy into mechanical energy would not occur, The plant cycle is a closed loop that allows the same water to be used over and over again. Always, the power plants are situated far from residential areas and located outside cities and close to the sea, because the steam is produced from seawater. The advantages of the steam power stations are as follows: They can produce high <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> electrical energy from small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> fuel. They have low initial costs, obstetrics and maintenance costs are not high, and the stations do not need much space to be built and they have usually high capacity. The disadvantages of steam stations are the following: They cause environmental pollution, they have low efficiency, and require very big quantities <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>water,</b> and the stations must be built away from populated areas. Conclusion: Converting in steam power plant is one of many ways to produce electrical energy in the world. It can be done in any country because it can be done with different chemical sources. In Saudi Arabia we use oil, because it easier and cheaper than any other chemical source for us. As any country would use what is better for them. The thesis has described circulation system in Shoaiba power plant by converting chemical energy to thermal energy in the boiler, then the turbine converts thermal energy to mechanical energy. Then the mechanical energy is converted to electrical energy in the generator. The advantages of the steam stations are as follows: production <b>of</b> high <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> electrical energy from small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> fuel, low cost of the initial costs, obstetrics and maintenance costs are not high, the station does not need much space to build and they are usually high capacity.

40|$|The {{one-dimensional}} {{numerical simulation}} model of reservoir hydrodynamics, DYRESM, {{is used to}} examine the effects of Retention Time (RT) on reservoir stratification. The model is verified using data from 3 years of high flow (short retention time, RT), on two reservoirs in the Czech Republic. The verified model was used to make a systematic series of simulations with varying RT, outlet location and inflow temperature in order to gauge the affect on heat budgets, temperature stratification, flows and mixing in deep valley reservoirs. The prototype examples corresponded to two temperate and one subtropical reservoir. The results show important effects of RT on reservoir hydrodynamics up to RT = 200, but a leveling off for RT > 400. Temperature stratification and hydrodynamic conditions are shown to be very sensitive to the inflow temperature and outlet depth. Results indicate that the energy released by large inflows is a major factor in determining the degree of mixing, and hence lower RT values lead to a weaker stratification in general. However, the height of withdrawal can have a significant impact on overall temperature and hence stratification. For example, large withdrawals from a deep outlet can lead to a reservoir with warmer average temperature by removing large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooler</b> bottom <b>water.</b> Similarly, surface withdrawals may remove warmer water leading to a cooler average temperature. These effects are moderated by inflow temperatures and surface heat exchanges.

The plateaus of the curves for sea water and for potassium-free sea water were beneath the depolarization value necessary for contraction, so that it is clear that no <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> with sea <b>water</b> alone or with potassium-free sea water would ever be effective. When the muscle is treated with subthreshold <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> potassium arid rapidly cooled in various concentrations of sodium ion and calcium ion, respectively, the sodium and calcium do not affect the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> depolarization. Acetylcholine, in subthreshold amounts, has a potentiating effect, but, unlike potassium and cooling, acts through the nervous apparatus. Mytilus muscle will respond to cooling with tonic contraction whenever a critical threshold <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> depolarization is achieved. Cooling alone cannot trigger the contraction since it cannot bring about sufficient depolarization. Cooling can result in contraction, however, if used in conjunction with some other subthreshold depolarizing agent. Cooling affects the contractile mechanism by first causing membrane breakdown and depolarization...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this design project is to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of power recovery from a lowgrade heat source. Specifically, the design team investigated the technical and economic issues associated with building a plant to recover power from a waste heat stream that is the byproduct of another process, such as a power or chemical plant. The project specifies that the incoming hot air stream is at 120 psi and 230 oF, {{and there are no}} external heat sources. The project champion suggests the design team to use a modified organic Rankine cycle with a dense liquid expander for more thermodynamically efficient heat recovery. However, the design used in this report presents a modification on the suggested cycle by adding a flash evaporator to separate a liquid-vapor stream before the condenser. This change decreases costs associated with the size of the condenser, as well as the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> needed. This provides for a more economical and efficient process. Concerning the process thermodynamics and readiness, we conclude that the low-grade heat recovery cycle is feasible in its current iteration, and it provides a viable method to recover energy from a low-grade heat stream. From an economic standpoint, we conclude that this process would be economically feasible if energy costs increased by 15 %- 20 %, to about $ 0. 096 /kWh. However, it is not currently economically competitive, because the cost of the equipment and building the plant to recover the energy are significantly high in comparison to the amount of energy recovered from the process...|$|E
40|$|The heat {{radiated}} by a {{large pool}} fire is the main heat transfer mechanism to the surroundings. In case of a pool fire occurring in a tank farm, {{the evaluation of the}} radiation to the system of tanks in the vicinity of a flame is the crucial point for designing and sizing of the cooling rig and estimating the local and overall <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> to prevent the fire from propagating inside the tank farm. The usual approach to the radiation calculation in such cases is the solid flame model. The irradiation to the surroundings is calculated by a set of empirical correlations for flame thermal and geometrical parameters and the radiation propagation from the flame to the targets is calculated by taking into account the (overall or local) view factor values and radiation attenuation in the atmosphere. In this paper four literature models for solid flame modelling are critically examined and compared {{on the basis of their}} ability to predict the radiation data, on given targets, taken from the literature. The models here considered were proposed by Mudan (or SFPE model), Rew et al. (HSE), Shokry and Beyler (NRC) and TNO. Presented results show that, among the uniform emission models, the Mudan method can give the most reliable predictions on radiated heat transfer as the pool fire diameter is varied in the 3 ~ 60 m range, while the non-uniform emission model by Rew et al. seems to be able to more precisely take into account the variation of the fuel properties and the radiation effects in the close and far field from the flame surface...|$|E

40|$|Silicon wafer {{fabrication}} facilities require a significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> temperate <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> to meet high internal cooling loads. The tertiary chilled water systems operate year round to fulfil the constant cooling load needed for production. Conventional chillers require a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> electricity to <b>cool</b> the <b>water</b> by the vapor compression cycle. As energy costs increase and environmental stewardship becomes {{the norm in}} industry, sustainable technologies are needed to chill process <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> without the significant energy consumption of today’s chillers. Night sky radiation cools a medium by radiating heat from a warm medium to the colder night sky. The Intel silicon wafer manufacturing facility in Rio Rancho, New Mexico was selected to be an ideal location {{for the implementation of}} two full-scale designs. Numerous system designs were examined during a thorough literature survey, and an open water system was chosen as the best alternative because of its superior heat transfer ability and lower construction cost. At the suggestion of an external auditor, a closed system was studied further, designed, and economically analyzed. Recommendations for system choice are based on economic analyses, system operability, and environmental considerations. To aid in model construction and full-scale design, an extensive research program was developed to confirm literature correlations and determine the effectiveness of radiation to the night sky as a method used to <b>cool</b> <b>water.</b> Experiments that <b>cooled</b> an aluminum plate through the ambient temperature were used to confirm and verify the accuracy of Berdahl and Martin’s correlation for calculating the effective temperature of the night sky. A prototype for the open water system was built to demonstrate the <b>cooling</b> ability <b>of</b> the design. Operation of the prototype successfully demonstrated radiative night sky cooling, showed the benefit of convective heat transfer when the ambient air temperature is below the water temperature, and validated Berdahl and Martin’s model. With the experimental stage complete, the prototype system was scaled-up to a system for the Intel facility in Rio Rancho. The system diverts <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> from Intel’s <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> system into surge tanks. From the surge tanks, water is pumped up to the roof and is distributed among corrugated metal roofing units placed on top of the Intel central utilities building. The corrugated panels are supported by a pressure treated lumber frame. The chilled water isdistributed and collected by a PVC piping network. Model simulations of the full-scale system determined the <b>cooling</b> capability <b>of</b> the system. The full-scale simulation predicted that the system would eliminate over 90 % of the night-time chiller cooling loads during the winter. Throughout the year, the chillers use $ 280, 000 worth of electricity 1. The radiative cooling system will save the company $ 75, 000 in annual electricity costs, a decrease in electricity consumption of 27 %. The electricity generation portfolio of PNM, Intel’s electricity provider, was used to determine that the system will prevent approximately 930 tons of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere. The reduction of produced electricity will also conserve 4, 220, 000 gallons of water, a scarce resource in the southwestern Unites States. For the open system, the total capital cost is $ 353, 500 and the operating cost, including electricity to operate the unit, is $ 31, 600 /year. For the closed system, the total capital cost is $ 636, 500 and the operating cost, including electricity to operate the unit, is $ 12, 000 /year. The average net reduction in annual electrical usage is 1, 282 MW-hr and the average yearly electrical cost savings is $ 75, 265 for both systems. The payback period for the open and closed systems are estimated to be 4. 77 years and 6. 8 years, respectively. The radiative cooling system will economically benefit the Intel facility; however, the reduction in carbon emissions and water usage is of immense importance to the public and a company as dedicated to environmental initiatives as is Intel...|$|R
