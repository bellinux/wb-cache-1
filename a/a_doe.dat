5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage {{to look at all}} the animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, mouses, a snake, an owl, a monkey, <b>a</b> <b>doe</b> — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage and puts it on her shoulders. During the second refrain, she remains standing with closed eyes {{in the middle of the}} room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with a monkey in her arms, leads them outside into the woods. Standing in the forest, she closes her eyes again and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E

Judd does not see Marty approaching, and shoots <b>a</b> <b>doe</b> out of season, which would mean a stiff fine Judd cannot afford. Marty lets Judd know he knows, and attempts to blackmail him out of Shiloh. Judd and Marty eventually negotiate a deal in which Marty will earn Shiloh for 40 dollars, paid with 20 hours of working for Judd. At {{the end of the first}} week, Judd says that he will not keep his end of the deal because the evidence of the dead doe has with the passage of time disappeared. Second, the contract that Marty had him sign is worthless in the state of West Virginia without the signature of a witness. Despite Judd's pointed disapproval of his work, Marty continues to work for him. They begin discussing dogs and Judd's father who began physically abusing Judd when he was four years old. In the end, Judd warms to Marty, relents, and lets him keep Shiloh.|$|E
5|$|In June 1944, Eichelberger {{was summoned}} to Sixth Army {{headquarters}} by Krueger. The Battle of Biak, where the 41st Infantry Division had landed in May, was going badly, and the airfields that MacArthur had promised {{would be available to}} support the Battle of Saipan were not in American hands. Eichelberger found that the Japanese, who were present in larger numbers than originally reported, were ensconced in caves overlooking the airfield sites. While the Americans were better trained and equipped than at Buna, so too were the Japanese, who employed their new tactics of avoiding costly counterattacks and exacting the maximum toll for ground gained. After seeing the situation for himself, Eichelberger concluded that Fuller's 41st Infantry Division had not done too badly. Nonetheless, as at Buna, Eichelberger relieved a number of officers that he felt were not performing as the battle ground on. His orders were to supersede Fuller as task force commander rather than relieve him as division commander, but Fuller requested his own relief, and Krueger obliged him. On Eichelberger's recommendation, Fuller was replaced by Brigadier General Jens <b>A.</b> <b>Doe.</b> Krueger was unimpressed with Eichelberger's performance on Biak, concluding that Eichelberger's tactics were unimaginative, and no better than Fuller's, and may have delayed rather than expedited the capture of the island. On the other hand, MacArthur thought sufficiently highly of Eichelberger's performance to award him the Silver Star.|$|E

25|$|Grant’s gazelles {{sexually mature}} at 18 months. Territory-holding bucks mate more than ones in {{bachelor}} groups. The courting ritual {{begins with a}} buck following <b>a</b> <b>doe,</b> {{waiting for her to}} urinate. When she does, the male does the Flehmen response to determine if she is in estrus. If she is, he will continue to follow her. The female will lift her tail, signaling she is ready to mate, and the male will mount her. The gestation period for the gazelle lasts for 198 days. Births peak in January and February. <b>A</b> <b>doe</b> will leave her herd and find a well-hidden place to give birth. Afterwards, the female eats the afterbirth and other fluids to keep the fawn clean and scentless. Females that have recently given birth will stay together for protection. The does nurse their fawns four times a day. Fawns are immobile for the first few days, so the mother stays close by. When the fawn can walk, it leaves with its mother to find a herd. Around this time, fawns will associate with one another in peer groups. A gazelle is weaned at six months, but will continue to associate with its mother until adolescence.|$|E

25|$|The twin sons of Poseidon and Iphidemia, Otos and Ephialtes, grew {{enormously}} {{at a young}} age.

The growth of the Aloadae never stopped, and they boasted that as soon as they could reach heaven, they would kidnap Artemis and Hera and take them as wives. The gods were afraid of them, except for Artemis who captured a fine deer (or in another version of the story, she changed herself into <b>a</b> <b>doe)</b> and jumped out between them. The Aloadae threw their spears and so mistakenly killed each other.|$|E

They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called Eden, where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis on gynocide.

Computer software designed specifically for designed experiments became available from various leading software companies in the 1980s and included packages such as JMP, Minitab, Cornerstone and Design - Expert.|$|R

The former expresses her pity for Arindal while the latter says he deserves punishment for seeking to take Ada from them. They wake him and announce they will lead him to Ada to rescue her. He expresses his willingness to die for her. The two fairies hope this will actually happen.|$|E
25|$|In the Secret History of the Mongols, the Mongol peoples {{are said}} to have descended from the mating of <b>a</b> <b>doe</b> (gua maral) and a wolf (boerte chino). In modern Mongolia, the wolf is still seen as a good luck symbol, {{especially}} for males. In Mongolian folk medicine, eating the intestines of a wolf is said to alleviate chronic indigestion, while sprinkling food with powdered wolf rectum is said to cure hemorrhoids. Mongol mythology explains the wolf's occasional habit of surplus killing by pointing to their traditional creation story. It states that when God explained to the wolf what it should and should not eat, he told it that it may eat one sheep out of 1,000. The wolf however misunderstood and thought God said kill 1,000 sheep and eat one.|$|E

500|$|From 1953 to 1989, the Rocky Flats Plant, <b>a</b> <b>DOE</b> {{nuclear weapon}} {{facility}} {{that was about}} 15 miles from Denver, produced fissile plutonium [...] "pits" [...] for nuclear warheads. A major fire at the facility in 1957, as well as leakage from nuclear waste stored at the site between 1958 and 1968, resulted in the contamination of some parts of Denver, to varying degrees, with plutonium-239, a harmful radioactive substance with a half-life of 24,200 years. A study by the Jefferson County health director, Dr. Carl Johnson, in 1981, linked the contamination {{to an increase in}} birth defects and cancer incidence in central Denver and nearer Rocky Flats. Later studies confirmed many of his findings. Plutonium contamination was still present outside the former plant site , and presents risks to building the envisioned Jefferson Parkway, which would complete Denver's automotive beltway.|$|E
