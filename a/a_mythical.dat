(Once again Mercator did not term this {{collection of}} maps as an atlas but in the preface he introduces Atlas as <b>a</b> <b>mythical</b> King of Mauretania—a learned philosopher, mathematician and astronomer, credited with {{the making of the}} first globe.) This collection has a dedication to Prince Ferdinando de' Medici to whom Mercator attributes ancestry from King Atlas.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many people}} believe this owl has {{exceptional}} night vision, its retina is no more sensitive than a human's and its asymmetrically placed ears are key to its hunting by giving it excellent directional hearing. Its nocturnal habits and eerie, easily imitated call, have led to <b>a</b> <b>mythical</b> association of the tawny owl with bad luck and death.|$|E

According to Matthew Hopkins, a witch hunter general during the English Civil War, least weasels were the familiars of witches.|$|E

5|$|Previous offers by Paramount Pictures {{for a film}} {{adaptation}} of SpongeBob SquarePants had been rejected by Stephen Hillenburg, but he eventually accepted one offer in 2002. A writing team consisting of Hillenburg, Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne and Tim Hill was assembled, conceiving the idea of <b>a</b> <b>mythical</b> hero's quest {{and the search for}} a stolen crown, which would bring SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface. The film was originally intended as the series finale, but Nickelodeon ordered more episodes of the series as it had become increasingly profitable, so Hillenburg resigned as showrunner with Tibbitt taking his place.|$|E
5|$|Sea Mither, or Mither of the Sea, is <b>a</b> <b>mythical</b> {{being of}} Orcadian {{folklore}} {{that lives in}} the sea during summer, when she confines the demonic nuckelavee to the ocean depths.

Eventually Sea Mither overcomes Teran and sends him to the depths of the ocean, but the effort of keeping him confined there along with her other benevolent labours during the summer exhaust her, until in the autumn Teran takes advantage of her weakness to wrest control from her once again.|$|E

5|$|The {{most famous}} shrines {{in the city}} include Inaba Shrine, Kogane Shrine, and Kashimori Shrine. They are {{considered}} a family of shrines because the Inishiki Irihiko-no-mikoto god at Inaba Shrine is married to the Nunoshi Hime-mikoto goddess at Kogane Shrine; together, they are {{the parents of the}} Ichihaya-no-mikoto God at Kashimori Shrine. Inaba Shrine was originally located on the northern side of Mount Kinka, but was moved to its present location by Saitō Dōsan during his reign over Gifu. Kogane Shrine is located in Kogane Park, behind the Gifu City Culture Center, and a popular legend says that, behind Kashimori Shrine, you can see the footprints of Tenba, <b>a</b> <b>mythical</b> horse.|$|E
5|$|The name Mysore is an anglicised {{version of}} Mahishūru, {{which means the}} abode of Mahisha in the vernacular Kannada. The common noun Mahisha, in Sanskrit, means buffalo; in this context, however, Mahisha refers to Mahishasura, <b>a</b> <b>mythical</b> demon who could assume the form of both human and buffalo, who, {{according}} to Hindu mythology, ruled the ancient parts of Mysore Kingdom, known in Sanskrit as Mahíšhaka, centred at Mahishapura. He was killed by the Goddess Chamundeshwari, whose temple is situated atop the Chamundi Hills, after whom it is named. 'Mahishapura' later became Mahisūru (a name which, even now, the royal family uses), and finally came to be anglicised as Mysore by the British and Maisūru/Mysuru in the vernacular Kannada language.|$|E
5|$|The nuckelavee is <b>a</b> <b>mythical</b> sea {{creature}} that {{appears as a}} horse-like demon when it ventures onto land. Writer and folklorist Ernest Marwick considered it {{very similar to the}} Norwegian nøkk, the nuggle of the Shetlands and the kelpie. A unique and solitary creature possessing extensive evil powers, its malevolent behaviour can influence events throughout the islands. Islanders were terrified of the creature and would not speak its name without immediately saying a prayer. It was often found in the vicinity of a beach, but would never come ashore if it was raining.|$|E

5|$|Titan Quest was {{envisioned by}} game {{designer}} Brian Sullivan as a role-playing game set in Ancient Greece similar to Age of Empires. Production began in 2004 after a successful pitch to THQ. The script {{was written by}} Randall Wallace, while Sullivan acted as the designer. Despite being in <b>a</b> <b>mythical</b> setting, the team {{wanted to make the}} environments and towns feel as realistic as possible, leading to a large amount of research into ancient cultures. Enemies were inspired by the game's regional mythologies, with designs inspired by the stop-motion work of Ray Harryhausen. The music, composed by Scott Morton and Michael Verrette, was created to avoid the looping tracks of other games.|$|E
5|$|Dead Phoenix {{was going}} to be a 3D shoot 'em up {{featuring}} a winged man named Phoenix. Based on trailer footage, IGN compared the gameplay to Panzer Dragoon. Players would take control of a winged man as he flies around shooting massive enemies, with the aid of allies on foot. Capcom's announcement described the setting as <b>a</b> <b>mythical</b> floating city, full of monsters and dragons. Game Informer announced that a Japanese release was planned in mid-2003. The game was believed to be canceled by May 2003, but Capcom stated at a press conference prior to the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) that it was still in development. IGN speculated that the game may have been retooled as a new Kid Icarus title, based on Nintendo's trend in the early 2000s of licensing properties to third parties. It was canceled in August 2003 after failing to appear at E3.|$|E
5|$|E.V.O.: Search for Eden tells <b>a</b> <b>mythical</b> saga of life's {{evolution}} on Earth, with a subtext of {{a creation}} myth and polytheistic evolution. The player takes {{the role of}} one of many billions of lifeforms created by Gaia, the nurturing and benevolent daughter of Sol, the Sun. Among the creatures known as life, there is a competition to evolve, and the best lifeform will eventually be granted the privilege of entering the Garden of Eden and becoming the husband and partner of Gaia. As the game progresses, it soon becomes apparent some mysterious external force is interfering with evolution on Earth in a destructive manner. Strange crystals not native to Gaia appear across the planet, and creatures that eat the crystals are transformed into monstrously powerful beings that dominate all other lifeforms, overconsume resources and disrupt the flow of evolution. In each Age the player character is tasked with confronting the species transformed by the crystals and defeating them so that the evolution of life can continue as intended.|$|E

5|$|Hanna M. Roisman compares Kint to Odysseus, {{capable of}} {{adapting}} both his personality and his tales {{to his current}} audience. Throughout his tale, Kint adapts his confession to Kujan's revealed biases. Roisman draws direct parallels to Odysseus' tales to the Phaeacians: like Odysseus, Kint allows his audience to define him and his narrative. Appealing to Kujan's arrogance, Kint allows himself to be outwitted, humiliated, and broken by his interrogator; Kint further invents <b>a</b> <b>mythical</b> villain that he credulously believes in and gives Kujan the privileged perspective of the skeptic. Kint thus creates a neo-noir thriller inside of a neo-noir thriller and demonstrates the artificiality of storytelling. Benjamin Widiss identifies post-structural elements to the film, such as {{the lack of a}} clear protagonist throughout much of the film. This extends to ambiguity over Kint's role as author or reader, and whether he is Kint pretending to be Söze or the reverse.|$|E
5|$|Previous {{security}} {{features in the}} Ship Series were carried over to the Portrait Series, and new ones incorporated into the banknote.

Paper versions issued by BCCS features its logo and the face value, while those issued by the MAS features its logo with the Merlion (<b>a</b> <b>mythical</b> creature and national symbol) and the face value. Polymer versions of the banknote have the Kinegram replaced by {{an image of the}} Singapore lion symbol with the face value, showing the coat of arms of Singapore when tilted at varying degrees.|$|E
5|$|Verbal {{explains}} that, {{six weeks}} earlier in New York, {{he and the}} other criminals were arrested on supposedly a trumped-up hijacking charge, and decided to pull another heist to get back at the police. Led by Keaton, a former corrupt policeman, they robbed a group of corrupt cops who transported smugglers in a police convoy. They then went to California to fence the stolen jewels with a criminal named Redfoot, who turned them on to another jewel heist. The quarry turned out to be heroin, and the five had to shoot their way out. Soon after, a lawyer named Kobayashi tells them that Keyser Söze, a Turkish crime lord with <b>a</b> <b>mythical</b> reputation from whom all of the thieves had unwittingly stolen (including Hockney who hijacked the original truck six weeks earlier in New York), had offered them a job: invade a ship manned by a gang of Argentinian drug dealers whom Söze was competing with and destroy the $91 million worth of cocaine that they were transporting.|$|E
