40|$|In {{the high}} {{temperature}} cuprate superconductors, {{the pervasiveness of}} anomalous electronic transport properties suggests that violation of conventional Fermi liquid behavior is closely tied to superconductivity. In other classes of unconventional superconductors, <b>atypical</b> <b>transport</b> is well correlated with proximity to a quantum critical point, but {{the relative importance of}} quantum criticality in the cuprates remains uncertain. Here we identify quantum critical scaling in the electron-doped cuprate material La 2 -xCexCuO 4 with a line of quantum critical points that surrounds the superconducting phase as a function of magnetic field and charge doping. This zero-temperature phase boundary, which delineates a metallic Fermi liquid regime from an extended non-Fermi liquid ground state, closely follows the upper critical field of the overdoped superconducting phase and gives rise to an expanse of distinct non Fermi liquid behavior at finite temperatures. Together with signatures of two distinct flavors of quantum fluctuations, this suggests that quantum criticality plays a significant role in shaping the anomalous properties of the cuprate phase diagram.

40|$|Lysosomes clear macromolecules, {{maintain}} nutrient {{and cholesterol}} homeostasis, participate in tissue repair, {{and in many}} other cellular functions. To assume these tasks, lysosomes rely on their large arsenal of acid hydrolases, transmembrane proteins and membrane-associated proteins. It is therefore imperative that, post-synthesis, these proteins are specifically recognized as lysosomal components and are correctly sorted to this organelle through the endosomes. Lysosomal transmembrane proteins contain consensus motifs in their cytosolic regions (tyrosine- or dileucine-based) that serve as sorting signals to the endosomes, whereas most lysosomal acid hydrolases acquire mannose 6 -phosphate (Man- 6 -P) moieties that mediate binding to two membrane receptors with endosomal sorting motifs in their cytosolic tails. These tyrosine- and dileucine-based motifs are tickets for boarding in clathrin-coated carriers that transport their cargo from the trans-Golgi network and plasma membrane to the endosomes. However, increasing evidence points to additional mechanisms participating in the biogenesis of lysosomes. In some cell types, for example, there are alternatives to the Man- 6 -P receptors for the transport of some acid hydrolases. In addition, several “non-consensus” sorting motifs have been identified, and <b>atypical</b> <b>transport</b> routes to endolysosomes {{have been brought to}} light.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{conventional}} pairing fluctuation theory at the Hartree level leads to a normal state pseudogap in the fermionic spectrum. Our goal is to extend this Hartree approximated scheme to arrive at a generalized mean field theory of pseudogapped superconductors for all temperatures $T$. While an equivalent approach to the pseudogap has been derived elsewhere using a more formal Green's function decoupling scheme, in this paper we re-interpret this mean field theory and BCS theory as well, and demonstrate how they naturally relate to ideal Bose gas condensation. Here we recast the Hartree approximated Ginzburg-Landau self consistent equations in a T-matrix form. This recasting makes it possible to consider arbitrarily strong attractive coupling, where bosonic degrees of freedom appear at $ T^*$ considerably above $T_c$. The implications for transport both above and below $T_c$ are discussed. Below $T_c$ we find two types of contributions. Those associated with fermionic excitations have the usual BCS functional form. That they depend on the magnitude of the excitation gap, nevertheless, leads to rather <b>atypical</b> <b>transport</b> properties in the strong coupling limit, where this gap (as distinct from the order parameter) is virtually $T$-independent. In addition, there are bosonic terms arising from non-condensed pairs whose transport properties are shown here to be reasonably well described by an effective time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory.

The {{blood brain barrier}} (BBB) is impermeable to substrates that are not small lipophilic molecules. This aids {{in the prevention of}} toxins in the blood from entering the brain. However, this poses a barrier to drug delivery to the central nervous system (CNS). Transporters located on the brain barrier endothelial cells allow specific substrates to pass from the blood to the brain. One transporter located on the apical and basal side of the brain endothelial cells (BEC) is organic anion transporting polypeptide 1 c 1 (OATP 1 C 1 (human), Oatp 1 c 1 (rodent)). Oatp 1 c 1 is a Na+-independent, bidirectional transporter of not only organic anions, but also endogenous, exogenous and amphipathic organic compounds. In particular, Oatp 1 c 1 is a high affinity thyroxine transporter and displays <b>atypical</b> <b>transport</b> kinetics. There is little known about the structure of Oatp 1 c 1, but it is suggested to have 12 transmembrane spanning -helices which form a barrel-like structure with a central putative pore. Because Oatp 1 c 1 is a transmembrane spanning protein, it is difficult to obtain a crystal structure using current imaging techniques. Protein modeling has been used to create a probable 3 -dimensional (3 D) structure based on the previously crystallized structure of the glycerol- 3 -phosphate transporter, and homology modeling from other Oatps. We hypothesize that using homology modeling, and sequence conservation; we can target specific amino acids for mutagenesis that are thought to play a subtle role in thyroxine transport. I tested the hypothesis by making specific amino acid mutations allowing the study of Oatp 1 c 1 dependent transport biochemistry. By determining amino acids that play a subtle role in Oatp 1 c 1 mediated thyroxine transport, a probable structure can be further elucidated. Once the 3 D structure of the protein is further elucidated and amino acids involved in transport are identified, drugs can be rationally designed to utilize Oatp 1 c 1 transport from the blood to the brain. In the work presented in this thesis, twelve mutations were made to further characterize the Oatp 1 c 1 structure. Each mutation targeted an amino acid with > 80 % homology amongst the Oatps, except for two mutations with less than 80 % homology. The targeted amino acids are proposed to be involved in substrate transport and face toward the putative substrate channel. Wild type (WT) Oatp 1 c 1 was fit to a biphasic profile for thyroxine transport with a Km of 16 nM and an estimated Vmax of 2 pmol/min/mg protein. Examination of the kinetic profiles in mutant constructs F 88 A, I 96 A, and Y 227 L displayed a decrease in Km and Vmax for thyroxine transport, as well as a conversion from biphasic to standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics when compared to WT. Kinetic profiles of mutant constructs F 370 A and F 374 A displayed higher values for Km with similar Vmax. These results further support the hypothesized structure for Oatp 1 c 1 and identify key amino acids involved in substrate positioning within the putative pore. Results may also indicate the presence of non-overlapping high affinity and low affinity binding sites within Oatp 1 c 1...|$|E

40|$|Antipsychotic drugs (APDs) {{have been}} {{reported}} to induce lipogenic genes. This has been proposed to contribute to their efficacy in treating schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, as well as the metabolic side effects often associated with these drugs. The precise mechanism for the lipogenic effects of APDs is unknown, but is believed to involve increased activation of the lipogenic transcription factors, such as sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs). In a series of experiments in a model cell line, we found that a panel of typical and <b>atypical</b> APDs inhibited <b>transport</b> of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which houses the cholesterol homeostatic machinery. APDs belong to the class of cationic amphiphiles and as has been shown for other amphiphiles, caused lipoprotein-derived cholesterol to accumulate intracellularly, preventing it from being esterified in the ER and suppressing SREBP activation. APDs did not activate the liver X receptor, another transcription factor involved in lipogenesis. However, these drugs markedly reduced cholesterol synthesis. This paradoxical result indicates that the upregulation of SREBP-target genes by APDs may not translate to increased cellular cholesterol levels. In conclusion, we have determined that APDs disrupt intracellular trafficking and synthesis of cholesterol, which may have important clinical ramifications. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

40|$|Two-dimensional van der Waals {{materials}} {{have been a}} subject of intense research interest in recent years. High thermal conductivity of graphene can be utilized for many thermal management applications. In spite of possessing very high electron mobility, graphene can’t be used as transistors because {{of the absence of}} band gap; however transition metal dichalcogenides are another class of two-dimensional van der Waals materials with inherent band gap and show a great promise for future nanoelectronic applications. But in order to tailor these properties for commercial applications, we should develop {{a better understanding of the}} effect of extrinsic factors like size, rough edges, grain boundaries, mass-impurities, interaction with substrate etc. on thermal and electrical transport. Most materials exhibit a smooth ballistic-to-diffusive type of thermal transport in which when the sample size is small as compared to mean-free-path of phonons the transport is ballistic, whereas, when the sample size is large as compared to phonon mean-free-path, phonons undergo multiple scattering events and the thermal transport becomes diffusive in nature. However, graphene exhibits an <b>atypical</b> thermal <b>transport</b> behavior where thermal conductivity shows an increasing logarithmic trend even for samples far greater than the mean-free-path of phonons. We show that this anomalous behavior can be attributed to the significant contribution coming from momentum-conserving normal phonon-phonon scattering. Secondly, graphene grain boundaries have been found to significantly reduce thermal conductivity even in the presence of substrates. In spite of numerous studies on the effect of grain boundaries (GBs) on thermal conductivity in graphene, there lacks a complete correlation between GB resistance and misorientation angle across graphene GBs. We show a direct correlation between thermal GB resistance and mismatch angles with low angle mismatch can be captured only by GB roughness, whereas, large mismatch angles will lead to the formation of a disordered patch at the interface and it could significantly deteriorate the overall thermal conductivity even in the presence of substrates. GBs are found to affect electrical transport in two-dimensional systems as well. Owing to the excellent electronic properties and compactness of these two-dimensional materials, high quality 2 D heterojunctions are the subject of intense research interest in recent years. Graphene-MoS 2 heterojuctions are found to form ohmic contacts and show great potential for future nanoelectronic applications. We show that the interface resistance in Gr-MoS 2 heterojuctions can affect the overall resistance of the device if the channel (MoS 2) length is small at low carrier densities, whereas, at high carrier densities interface resistance do not play much role in determining the resistance of the entire device. However, if graphene and MoS 2 grains are misorientated then interface resistance can play a crucial role in determining the overall resistance of the device. We also show a weak dependence of misorientation angles on GB resistance across MoS 2 grain boundaries...|$|R
30|$|Other {{potential}} pathways for {{the toxic}} Na+ influx into roots are via K+ channels/transporters and HKT transporters. A characteristic feature of HKT transporters is the channel-like Na+ transport {{activity in the}} presence of a large amount of Na+ (Gassmann et al. [1996]; Xue et al. [2011]), which could contribute to Na+ over-accumulation in plants. Unlike the case of Arabidopsis plants, HKT transporters were found to form a gene family in cereals including rice (Garciadeblás et al. [2003]; Huang et al. [2008]). TaHKT 2; 1 -knockdown wheat plants exhibit low Na+ influx phenotypes under salt stress and have reduced salt sensitivity (Laurie et al. [2002]). A Na+ transporter OsHKT 2; 1, one of the seven OsHKT transporters in a japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare, has been demonstrated to mediate Na+ influx into roots under K+-starved conditions (Horie et al. [2001]; Garciadeblás et al. [2003]; Horie et al. [2007]; Yao et al. [2010]). However, it was also demonstrated that the Na+ transport activity of OsHKT 2; 1 is rapidly down-regulated in intact rice roots even upon a mild salt stress, suggesting that the contribution of OsHKT 2; 1 to toxic Na+ influx during salinity stress is little (Horie et al. [2007]). Given that the OsHKT 2; 4 transporter exhibited a broad cation transport activity including Ca 2 + in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and that immunological detection localized the OsHKT 2; 4 protein at the plasma membrane of rice root hair cells, a novel physiological role of OsHKT 2; 4 in Ca 2 +-linked processes has been proposed (Lan et al. [2010]). More recently, OsHKT 2; 4 was demonstrated to exhibit a strong K+ selectivity over divalent cations such as Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + with an <b>atypical</b> low Na+ <b>transport</b> activity compared to other HKT transporters (Horie et al. [2011 c]), suggesting that the potential contribution of OsHKT 2; 4 to the toxic Na+ influx is unlikely.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{explosive}} eruptions recorded {{from different}} volcanoes worldwide (e. g. Hekla in 2000, Eyjafjallajökull in 2010, Cordón-Caulle in 2011) demonstrated {{the necessity of}} a better assessment of the eruption source parameters (e. g. column height, mass eruption rate and especially the Total Grain-Size Distribution – TGSD) to reduce the uncertainties associated with the far-travelling airborne ash mass. To do so, volcanological studies started to integrate observations in order to use more realistic numerical inputs, crucial for taking robust volcanic risk mitigation actions. On 23 rd November 2013, Etna volcano (Italy) erupted producing a 10 -km height plume, from which two volcanic clouds were observed at two different altitudes from satellite (MSG-SEVIRI, MODIS). One was described as mainly composed by very fine ash (i. e. PM 20), whereas the second one as made of ice/SO 2 droplets (i. e. not measurable in terms of ash mass). <b>Atypical</b> north-easterly winds <b>transported</b> the tephra from Etna towards the Puglia region (southern Italy), permitting tephra sampling in proximal (i. e. ~  5 – 25 –km from source) and medial areas (i. e. Calabria region, ~  160  km). Based on the field data analysis, we estimated the TGSD but the paucity of data (especially related to the fine ash fraction) prevented it from being entirely representative of the initial magma fragmentation. To better estimate the TGSD covering the entire grain-size spectrum, we integrated the available field data with X-band weather radar and satellite retrievals. The resulting TGSD is used as input for the FALL 3 D tephra dispersal numerical model to reconstruct the tephra loading and the far-travelling airborne ash mass. The optimal TGSD is selected by solving an inverse problem through a best-fit with the field, ground-based and satellite-based measurements. The results suggest a total erupted mass of 1. 2 × 10 9  kg, which is very similar to the field-derived value of 1. 3 × 10 9  kg, and a TGSD with a PM 20 fraction between 3. 6 and 9. 0  wt%...|$|R
40|$|Heterogeneous, modally banded kyanite-bearing and bimineralic eclogites {{from the}} lithospheric mantle, {{collected}} at the Roberts Victor Diamond mine (South Africa), show a reaction texture in which kyanite is consumed. Geothermobarometric calculations using measured mineral compositions in Perple_X allowed {{the construction of a}} P-T path showing a steep, cool prograde metamorphic gradient of 2 �C/km to reach peak conditions of 5. 8 GPa and 890 �C for the kyanite eclogite. The kyanite-out reaction formed bimineralic eclogite and is probably {{an integral part of the}} mineralogical evolution of most archetypal bimineralic eclogites at Roberts Victor and potentially elsewhere. The kyanite-out reaction occured at close to peak pressure (5. 3 GPa) and was associated with a rise in temperature to 1380 �C. Mass balance calculations show that upon breakdown, the kyanite component is fully accommodated in garnet and omphacite via a reaction system with low water fugacity that required restricted fluid influx from metasomatic sources. The d 18 O values of garnets are consistently higher than normal mantle values. Each sample has its characteristic trend of d 18 O variance between garnets in the kyanite-bearing sections and those in the bimineralic parts covering a range between 5. 1 ‰ and 6. 8 ‰. No systematic change in O-isotope signature exists across the sample population. Differences in garnet trace element signatures between differing lithologies in the eclogites are significant. Grossular-rich garnets coexisting with kyanite have strong positive Eu-anomalies and low Gd/Yb ratios, while more pyrope-rich garnets in the bimineralic sections have lost their positive Eu-anomaly, have higher Gd/Yb ratios and generally higher heavy rare earth element contents. Garnets in the original kyanite-bearing portions thus reflect the provenance of the rocks as metamorphosed gabbros/troctolites. The kyanite-out reaction was most likely triggered by a heating event in the subcratonic lithosphere. As kyanite contains around 100 ppm of H 2 O it is suggested that the kyanite-out reaction, once initiated by heating and restricted metasomatic influx, was promoted by the release of water contained in the kyanite. The steep (high-P low-T) prograde P-T path defining rapid compression at low heating rates is <b>atypical</b> for subduction <b>transport</b> of eclogites into the lithospheric mantle.

40|$|TRP {{channels}} form a {{very large}} family of ion channels, with 28 members in mammals, that all conduct cations. These ion channels are present in almost all mammalian cells, where they perform various functions to sustain the proper physiology of cells and organisms. One of the main features of TRP channels {{is that they can}} be activated by many different kinds of stimuli. Over last fifteen years, researchers have described the mechanisms whereby the TRP channel gate can be regulated by various ligands, physical stimuli or cellular regulators, and how the conduction properties of the pore, through which ions pass, is determined. However, there were only few investigations that addressed how TRP channels reach the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, the mechanism of trafficking of TRP channels to the plasma membrane can be considered equally important as their gating and permeation mechanisms, because finally the total ion current mediated by TRP channels is the product of the number of channels in the plasma membrane, the current through a single channel and the channel’s open probability. In this study, we combined a variety of techniques to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms and physiological consequences of the trafficking of three members of the TRP channel superfamily: TRPM 4, TRPV 2 and TRPM 8. In the first results section, we used Total Internal Reflection – Fluorescence Microscopie (TIRFM) to visualize the near membrane dynamics of fluorescently labeled TRPM 4 and TRPV 2 channels. In particular, we optimized Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (TIR-FRAP) to selectively bleach the TRP channels in close proximity of the glass-plasma membrane interface, and followed the repopulation of the plasma membrane fluorescence, which allowed detailed analysis of newly incoming TRP channel structures with limited background fluorescence. We demonstrated that TRPM 4 approaches plasma membrane via 200 -nm diameter transport vesicles, lingers at a few 10 ’s of nm from the membrane, and subsequently undergo full fusion with the plasma membrane, where after TRPM 4 channels spread laterally in the membrane. In contrast, TRPV 2 approaches mainly via lateral diffusion from non-bleached areas of the plasma membrane. Our quantitative approach allows characterization of the 2 D diffusion coefficient for both channels, which point at a relatively unrestricted movement of the channels in the plasma membrane. This study not only demonstrates distinct modes of TRP channel turnover at the plasma membrane, but also illustrates the usefulness of TIR-FRAP to monitor these processes with high resolution. In the second results section, we focused on TRPM 8, which plays a vital role in sensing innocuous cold temperatures. TRPM 8 is also activated by cooling agents like menthol. TRPM 8 has also been implicated in many forms of pathological cold hypersensitivity and pain. Although previous studies have briefly outlined the nature of the perimembrane dynamics of TRPM 8, there was very little knowledge about the cellular and molecular mechanisms that determine TRPM 8 transport to the plasma membrane. In this study, through a combination of TIRFM, TIR-FRAP, cell physiological assays and in vivo behavior experiments; we demonstrated that TRPM 8 is carried toward the plasma membrane in non-acidic, LAMP 1 containing vesicles, which undergo fusion with plasma membrane with help of vesicle-associated SNARE protein VAMP 7. Moreover, we show that VAMP 7 -deficient mice have significantly reduced TRPM 8 activity in sensory neurons, and a concomitantly reduced cold avoidance behavior. These results unveiled a novel and <b>atypical</b> intracellular <b>transport</b> route for TRPM 8. In conclusion, in this work we have provided important new insights into the cellular and molecular processes that determine the trafficking of TRP channels towards the membrane, focusing on TRPM 4, TRPV 2 and TRPM 8. Our results indicate clearly distinct transport modes of transport for these three channels, which argues against a universal trafficking mechanism for TRP channels. As a consequence, {{further research is needed to}} address the trafficking mechanisms of the other members of the TRP superfamily. Such understanding will greatly enhance our capability to understand and address the pathophysiological conditions associated with TRP channels malfunction. The tools and approaches developed in this study may prove to be instrumental to conduct similar in depth studies on other TRP channels. status: publishe...|$|R
