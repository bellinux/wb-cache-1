40|$|Information {{technology}} {{has been linked to}} productivity growth {{in a wide variety of}} sectors, and health information technology (HIT) is a leading example of an innovation with the potential to transform industry-wide productivity. This paper analyzes the impact of HIT on the quality and intensity of care delivered to Medicare inpatients. Building an organizational model, I show how the adoption of HIT may improve patient health and may either increase or decrease medical expenditures. Using Medicare claims data from 1998 - 2005, I estimate the effects of HIT by exploiting variation in hospitals’ <b>adoption</b> <b>statuses</b> over time, analyzing 2. 5 million inpatient admissions across 3900 hospitals. HIT is associated with an initial 1. 3 % increase in billed charges, and there is no evidence of cost savings, even five years after adoption. Additionally, HIT adoption appears to have little impact on the quality of care, measured by patient mortality, medical complication rates, adverse drug events, and readmission rates. These results are robust to the addition of rich controls for pre-trends. The findings suggest that HIT is not associated with improvements in either the efficiency or quality of hospital care for Medicare patients, through five years after adoption. ∗I would like to thank David Autor, Amy Finkelstein, and Michael Greenstone for invaluable guidance throughou...|$|R

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that, compared to normative adolescence, adoptive adolescence could be considered a specific risk condition characterized by more psychiatric problems, attachment insecurity, and emotional regulation difficulties as consequences of negative experiences in preadoption relationships. The current study explores (a) a moderation model of <b>adoption</b> <b>status</b> on the association between attachment representations (secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and disorganized) and behavioural problems and (b) a moderation model of <b>adoption</b> <b>status</b> on the association between emotion regulation processes (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and behavioural problems. Both the moderation models were controlled for verbal skills. Forty-six adopted adolescents and a control group of 34 nonadopted peers (12 – 16  years old) living with both their biological parents were assessed using the Friends and Family Interview, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents, the Child Behaviour Check List 6 – 18, and the verbal subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, the latter as control measure. Results showed that <b>adoption</b> <b>status</b> (but not attachment) positively predicted externalizing and total behaviour problems, whereas attachment disorganization (but not <b>adoption</b> <b>status)</b> positively predicted internalizing problems in both group. Moreover, low cognitive reappraisal had a negative impact on externalizing problems only for adopted adolescents, but not for nonadopted youths.

Data showed differences between the families along an adoption communication openness continuum, ranging from families with strictly closed communication (the child did not know he/she had been adopted), families who just simply revealed the <b>adoption</b> <b>status,</b> to other families with an open and frequent adoption communication. The results showed the complexity of this phenomenon (adoption communication as being both universal and specific at the same time), which differed according to each family. Furthermore, results also highlighted the difficulty that some participating parents had in managing this task and in understanding adoption communication as a process rather than a single moment in time.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{economics}} of technology adoption in the healthcare industry. The first chapter analyzes the impact of health information technology (HIT) on the quality and intensity of care delivered to Medicare inpatients. Building an organizational model, I show how the adoption of HIT may improve patient health and may either increase or decrease medical expenditures. Using Medicare claims data from 1998 - 2005, I estimate the effects of HIT by exploiting variation in hospitals' <b>adoption</b> <b>statuses</b> over time, analyzing 2. 5 million inpatient admissions across 3900 hospitals. HIT is associated with an initial 1. 3 % increase in billed charges. Additionally, HIT adoption appears to have little impact {{on the quality of}} care, measured by patient mortality, medical complication rates, adverse drug events, and readmission rates. These results are robust to the addition of rich controls for pre-trends. The findings suggest that HIT is not associated with improvements in either the efficiency or quality of hospital care for Medicare patients, through five years after adoption. In the second chapter, I investigate the scope for physician learning about the value and applications of new medical technologies across geographic regions. In particular, I analyze the diffusion of positron emission tomography and deep brain stimulation, using data on Medicare claims from 1998 - 2005. The mix of patient diagnoses treated with the new technologies changes substantially during the early stages of diffusion. Moreover, states that are late to adopt these technologies do not repeat the process of experimental learning undertaken by early adopters to discover which patients should receive the new treatment In the third chapter, I analyze several policy initiatives that aim to manage the usage of medical technologies and discuss key determinants of technology adoption that may be fruitful targets for future research and policy intervention. Effective technology policy must balance cost, control with a recognition that new medical technologies have been associated with tremendous health and longevity gains. I find that existing Medicare coverage determinations and state certificate of need programs appear to have little influence on actual resource utilization, in part driven by lack of enforcement of existing policies. by Leila Agha.

The double jeopardy hypothesis suggests that when adopted children experience their parents 2 ̆ 7 divorce, they perform worse because they carry two risk factors, <b>adoption</b> <b>status</b> and parental divorce, while their non-adopted counterparts carry only the risk factor {{of their parents}} 2 ̆ 7 divorce. The buffering effect hypothesis suggests that, being adopted children, their previous experiences of parental loss help them better deal with the later loss of their parents 2 ̆ 7 divorce so their <b>adoption</b> <b>status</b> is a protective factor rather than a risk factor. ^ Secondary analyses of a nation-wide data set were executed using different statistical methods such as ANOVA and Chi-square on different outcome variables.

40|$|Building {{information}} modelling (BIM) {{has been seen}} {{as one of the most}} promising recent developments in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry as well as a revolutionary change for managing a project from beginning to end. The Singaporean government has promoted the use of BIM in the AEC industry to help firms improve their productivity. The objectives of this study are to investigate the BIM <b>adoption</b> <b>status</b> and to identify the hindrances to BIM adoption in Singapore. To achieve the objectives, a preliminary questionnaire survey was performed with 34 professionals. A BIM adoption index (BIMAI) was proposed to measure the extent of BIM adoption. The low average BIMAI implied that the BIM adoption in the Singaporean AEC industry was still immature. Consultants were found to have a higher level of BIM adoption than contractors. Additionally, three-dimensional presentation, clash detection, design coordination, and construction system design were found to be the functions that were significantly applied in practice. Furthermore, the statistical analysis results showed that the mean scores of hindrances ranged from 3. 79 to 2. 65. Nine of the 20 hindrances were statistically significant, and thus were considered as critical hindrances to BIM adoption in the Singaporean AEC industry. “Lack of subcontractors who can use BIM technology”, “cost of investment”, and “lack of demand for BIM use” were the top three hindrances. This study provides an understanding of the BIM <b>adoption</b> <b>status</b> in Singapore and allows the practitioners to take measures to reduce the critical hindrances...|$|E

It employs a double-hurdle approach to analyse the factors influencing adoption and intensity of ISMA technologies among households, using cross-sectional data of 643 farmers from the two states. The {{results show that the}} estimated coefficients of exogenous income and proximity to extension office are negatively significant (P < 0. 05), while higher total farm income, polygamous households, past participation in on-farm trials, awareness of the technology, contact with extension agents and access to cash remittances are positive and significant (P < 0. 01), and are the most significant factors likely to influence ISMA technologies <b>adoption.</b> Marital <b>status,</b> household size, farm size and access to cash remittances are most significant factors influencing adoption intensity. Maize farmers in the study area who adopted ISMA technologies obtained higher output than the non-adopters, which resulted in a positive and significant effect on their total farm income. Hence, policies targeted at increasing maize productivity through Striga management need to include ISMA technologies as a potentially feasible option. The study recommends actions to improve farmers’ access to financial services to increase their liquidity. Nevertheless, the most immediate action will be improvement in farmers’ access to extension services as they have proved to be a reliable source of information in the rural areas. Peer Revie...|$|R
