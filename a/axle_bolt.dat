The bearings slip into openings molded into {{each side of}} the wheel hub, and a flange molded into the wheel hub holds the bearings the correct distance apart. Additionally there is an axle spacer either machined into the axle or that slides over the axle (depending on the axle system used). Since the outer race of the bearing contacts the wheel spacer and the inner race of the bearing contacts the axle spacer, it is critical that the relationship between these two spacers is correct.

25|$|Constructed of {{light-gauge}} painted sheet steel, Joroleman designed his mailbox with an arched, tunnel-shape roof, which prevented excessive {{accumulation of}} rainwater or snow while resisting deformation. The tunnel top also simplified {{the process of}} mass production by {{eliminating the need for}} precise sheet metal bends. Stamped and formed metal straps riveted to the arched opening and the mailbox door served as a door latching mechanism, while a rotating red semaphore flag mounted on a shaft attached {{to the side of the}} mailbox served to signal the approaching mailman if there was outgoing mail inside. Fitted with a crimped or braze-on rear steel panel and a false floor to keep its contents dry in inclement or humid weather, the Joroleman mailbox required only two rivets, three <b>axle</b> <b>bolts,</b> and four screws and nuts for completion. Durable and inexpensive, the popularity of the Joroleman mailbox was further enhanced by a decision not to patent the design, but to make its specifications known to all potential manufacturers for competitive sale. Adopted across the United States, it has remained the top-selling mailbox since its introduction, and was also widely used in Canada prior to that country's decision to eliminate individual curbside delivery to rural residents.|$|R

This might have been partly owing to the shortness of his legs and the comparative amplitude of his trousers, which to the casual observer seemed to obviate the necessity of any other garment. But when he reached the bottom of the street, and further enlivened his progress by whistling shrilly between his fingers, and finally drew a fragment of a cigar from his pocket and placed it between his teeth, it was evident that there was a moral as well as physical laxity in his conduct. The near fact was that Aristides had that afternoon evaded the Sunday-school, and was open to any kind of infant iniquity.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 50 CrV 4 {{spring steel}} is a tough, shock resisting, shallow {{hardening}} chromium vanadium steel having high fatigue and impact {{resistance in the}} heat treated condition. It is used extensively in gears, pinions, springs, shafts, <b>axles,</b> pins, <b>bolts,</b> etc., which require high modulus of resilience. The alloy was realised through conventional melt route of electric arc furnace (EAF) followed by ESR. The application of the alloy {{is limited to a}} section thickness of 15 mm [1]. Hence obtaining optimum mechanical properties becomes a challenging task. In this study, the hardening as well as tempering operations were limited to 15 mm thickness. The samples from the alloy were subjected to hardening at 860 Â°C for 1. 25 h. and oil quenching to room temperature followed by tempering at four different temperatures of 250, 300, 370 & 450 Â°C for 3 h. each with oil quenching to room temperature. It was found that the alloy exhibited good combination of strength and ductility when tempered at 450 Â°C. Microstructural study revealed the presence of fine tempered lath martensite along with the presence of a very small amount of delta ferrite along prior austenitic grain boundaries. The AFNOR 50 CrV 4 / AISI- 6150 steel is widely used in the manufacturing of valve springs...|$|R
40|$|Alloy {{wheels are}} {{automobile}} wheels {{which are made}} from an alloy of aluminum or magnesium metals Or sometimes a mixture of both. Alloy wheels differ from normal steel wheels because of their lighter weight, which improves the steering and {{the speed of the}} car. Alloy wheels will reduce the unstrung weight of a vehicle compared to one fitted with standard steel wheels. The benefit of reduced unstrung weight is more precise steering as well as a nominal reduction in fuel consumption. Alloy is an excellent conductor of heat, improving heat dissipation from the brakes, reducing the risk of brake failure under demanding driving conditions. At present four wheeler wheels are made of Aluminum Alloys. In this project, Aluminum alloy are comparing with other Alloy. In this project a parametric model is designed for Alloy wheel used in four wheeler by collecting data from reverse engineering process from existing model.

This paper presents a detailed analysis of surface topology in dry machining of EN- 8 steel which is widely used material for general-purpose <b>axles,</b> shafts, gears, <b>bolts</b> and studs. Regression models are developed for Ra, Rq, and Rz parameters of surface topology which are very significant parameters from contact stiffness, fatigue strength and surface wear point of view. For all the regression models a good correlation is found between surface roughness and cutting parameters and hence these models can be used to predict the surface roughness within the range of cutting parameters under investigation. Regression models are compared with experimental values of roughness and with available geometrical models. Percent errors are also calculated by comparing regression models and experimental values and a geometrical model. It is found that the percent errors are very small for regression model as compared to geometrical model. Finaly performance of dry machining is compared with that of machining with coolant, no significant difference is found for the surface roughness with the dry machining and that of machining with coolant...|$|R

40|$|The writers {{appreciate}} the {{additional information on}} emergency stop-log deployment provided in the discussion by researchers from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. The studies noted were not found {{during the course of}} the research, and their inclusion would have been beneficial in the published paper. The writers also are grateful for the opportunity to respond to questions raised in a subsequent discussion of the article and are pleased to provide the following responses: Response # 1 : The observation made by the discusser is correct in that the data shown in Figs. 5 and 6 of the published article are not the actual forces that would be experienced by the hoist mechanism but rather represent the maximums to be expected. The most significant forces of concern for designing the hoist are the extremes that the hoist would experience during deployment of the stop logs, and those are what are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The hoist forces induced by the stop logs would actually go to zero during the deployment process because the stop logs are dogged and left resting on the pier and the hoist used to retrieve and make ready the next stop log for installation. Response # 2 : The horizontal axes in Figs. 5 and 6 vary from 0 to 6 and 0 to 10 meters, respectively. The distance measured is the vertical distance from the bottommost point of the bottom stop log to the seating surface on the spillway. Response # 3 : The force reduction shown in Fig. 5 âEL 310. 39 - 0. 005 m/s[*]EL[*] 310. 39 - 0. 005 [*]m/sâ has been reviewed by the writers, and its cause is unknown. The writersâ best estimate of the reduction prior to submersion is related to seal friction between the rubber seal used on the model stop logs and pier. A flexible membrane was used to seal the sides of the stop logs to the piers. Response # 4 : The insight provided by the discusser is appreciated and useful. The intent of the referenced sentences was to describe common problems associated with the typical installation of stop logs in flowing water and not to convey all possibilities of uplift or downpull. The discusser is correct in that uplift can occur for other reasons, as shown by the data presented in the paper. Response # 5 : The 14 - and 16 -gate spillways use hollow structural sections (HSS) having a depth of 0. 406 m, and the 7 -gate spillway uses HSS having a depth of 0. 610 meters, which agree with the discusserâs estimate. The depth was an important design consideration that was necessary for the design of the model stop logs and was considered by the licensed professional engineers performing the design. The weight of each log and the details of each stop log were carefully considered as the stop logs are presently being implemented on a specific structure. The paper was not intended to be a design guide but rather to introduce the concept and validate the performance of the specific designs. Response # 6 : The writers expect this seating force to be sufficient. The HSS tubes are being constructed to allow water ballast to be added to increase the seating force if necessary. Response # 7 : The discusser is correct; the friction forces are not governed by the same scaling laws that govern fluid flow for hydraulic modeling. For that reason, careful machining and high-quality stainless-steel <b>axle</b> <b>bolts</b> were used in conjunction with machined aluminum wheels. The purpose of the model was to validate whether the design was deployable under emergency conditions. The notion of using sealed bearings was considered and dismissed after a discussion about friction between the model and the prototype. The rationale was such that the prototype bearings will have less friction than the model and that the model would be conservative pertaining to stop-log stalling. One of the important considerations of the design was to size the hoists and not resolve component forces. In none of the cases investigated was the hoist force greater than the static weight of the stop logs. Certain tests, which were not included in the published paper, were completed with the stop logs stalled at some opening. In those cases, the hoist forces were similar to those with stop-log movement. Additionally, different rates of stop-log deployment showed very similar hoist forces, and it was determined that the hoist forces were a function of position and not deployment rate. Response # 8 : The writers apologize for the confusion and hope that the following sentences clear it up sufficiently. The intent was to set depths corresponding to approximately one-third and two-thirds of the free-flowing depth at the spillway crest. Therefore the gate was inserted to approximately one-third of the flow depth to create the two-thirds flow depth and the gate insertion of two-thirds created the one-third depth. In retrospect, it would have been better to simply list gate elevations and flow depths. Read More: [URL]...|$|R
