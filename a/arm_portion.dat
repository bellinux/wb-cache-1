40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the benefits and}} new perspectives in minimally invasive surgery, related {{to the development of}} a new generation of surgical robots for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) with snail architecture and variable stiffness actuation. Snail surgical arms have been proposed and are under development for laparoscopic surgery with access to the patients's body through external incisions. The same concept can be transferred to NOTES procedures with the benefit to improve the reach of the organs by the robot and then to shorten the active portion of the snail arm (besides the general benefits of NOTES such as avoiding external scars). The use of variable stiffness actuation (together with the shortening of the <b>arm</b> <b>portion</b> active during the operation) can further improve controllability and safety. The research involves the development of a miniaturized VSA using superelastic alloy, small enough to be embedded in the joints of the arm. The targeted diameter is 6 mm for the first prototype. The new NOTES instruments proposed are expected to carry out surgical tasks in a large and complex workspace, overcoming obstacles and being safe in case of accidental impacts with the surgical environment. The research is carried out in the framework of the Italian Strategic Research Programmes 2008 - 2012. A detailed description of the project is provided...|$|E

The amino acid composition of purified laminin- 5 was in agreement with that compiled from the recently published cDNA sequences of the alpha 3 -, beta 3 -, and gamma 2 -laminin chains. Moreover, the content of half-cystine residues in laminin- 5 was about two-thirds that in laminin- 1, which confirms the prediction of {{a smaller number of}} epidermal growth factor-like repeats in the amino-terminal portion of the three chains. The content of coiled-coil alpha-helices (27 %) determined by CD spectroscopy was comparable to that reported for laminin- 1, which indicates that the long <b>arm</b> <b>portion</b> of laminin- 5 is equivalent to that of other laminin isoforms. The melting temperature was recorded at 72 degrees C by CD monitoring of unfolding and refolding of the coiled-coil structures during thermal denaturation and renaturation, respectively. The thermal stability of laminin- 5 is therefore significantly higher than that of laminin- 1 or alpha 2 -chain-containing laminins, which suggests higher ionic interactions between the three polypeptide chains of laminin- 5. Cell adhesion-promoting activity of laminin- 5 was found to be strictly and entirely dependent on the presence of coiled-coil structures. It decreased gradually after heat denaturation of the protein above 65 degrees C and was totally abrogated at 75 degrees C. This is in contrast to laminin- 1, which contains both conformation-dependent and -independent cell-binding sites on the long and short arm domains, respectively.

Three {{separate}} gun batteries were built: Battery Murphy (two 16-inch guns), Battery 206 (two 6-inch guns), and a temporary 2-gun battery of 155 mm artillery. Along with these guns were three related fire control towers: two on Swallow Cave Rd. and one on Nahant Rd., plus a large underground plotting room behind Battery Murphy that served that battery's two big guns. Also, the northern series of Navy-operated magnetic loop cables, emplaced to detect enemy vessels (particularly U-boats) approaching Boston Harbor, terminated on the shore just southeast of the two 155mm gun positions. All of these facilities were located in the area called East Point, at the extreme southeast end of the Nahant tombolo, as shown in the map at left.

Presumably, these thirteen specimens represent {{only a portion of}} the ophiuroid material referred to in two papers by Binkhorst van den Binkhorst, both published in 1859, because all are assignable to two species which are common only in the Nekum and Meerssen members of the type Maastrichtian, namely Felderophiura vanderhami Jagt, 1991, and Ophiomusium lux Jagt & Kutscher in Jagt, 2000. Brittlestar material from lower levels within the Maastricht Formation (i. e., Valkenburg, Gronsveld, Schiepersberg and Emael members) referred to by Binkhorst has not been traced. Alternatively, Binkhorst’s original records could have been based on specimens contained in collections of his contemporaries, such as Joseph de Bosquet and Casimir Ubaghs. In most, if not all, of such cases, representatives of Ophiomusium gr. granulosum (Roemer, 1841) [sensu Jagt, 2000] are involved. Based on our own observations in the Maastricht area, Binkhorst’s specimens of F. vanderhami and O. lux must have originated from the upper Meerssen Member where these two species are locally common. In fact, mostly isolated discs are preserved in the present lot, with only some retaining proximal <b>arm</b> <b>portions,</b> which suggests these were picked from sieving residues after bulk sample processing. More or less complete specimens of both species have also been collected recently, but these are confined to bedding planes.

40|$|Lake Mead, Nevada is {{the largest}} {{reservoir}} by volume in the United States, {{as well as a}} popular sport fishing destination. In January 2007, the invasive quagga mussel Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (Andrusov, 1897) was discovered in the reservoir and concerns began to arise about potential alterations to the aquatic environment. The Lake Mead sport fishery is reliant on the sustainability of prey species like the threadfin shad [Dorosoma petenense (Günther, 1867) ]. This study examined 20 -year trends in historic abundance of the threadfin shad, before, and shortly after, the discovery of quagga mussels in the system. Larval shad trawl data collected in Las Vegas Bay and Overton <b>Arm</b> <b>portions</b> of Lake Mead were analyzed in the present study. Two-way analysis of variances showed that the abundance of this prey fish has not changed following quagga mussel invasion (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). Post-quagga mussel discovery collections of adult threadfin shad from Las Vegas Bay ranged from 113 to 212 mm total length (TL) (mean = 184 mm; n = 170). Shad from Overton Arm ranged from 131 to 197 mm TL (mean = 150 mm; n = 27). Stomach contents were analyzed. The proportion of cladocerans in stomach contents differed significantly from spring to winter in Las Vegas Bay (P = 0. 008); whereas the proportion of copepods did not show statistically relevant differences regarding seasonality (P = 0. 562). Initial trends in lower trophic level dynamics in response to quagga mussel invasion has yet to reveal significant effects in Las Vegas Bay or Overton Arm. Long-term monitoring on threadfin shad is needed to evaluate potential impacts from invasive quagga mussels in Lake Mead...|$|R

Two treatments were considered: (a) moist, measurements taken at three spots on a transect when the pivot was running over it; (b) dry, measurements taken simultaneously at a fourth spot D, 270 m apart. A total of 34 irrigation events were monitored, seven of which included plant transpiration measurements. For the transpiration-measured irrigation events, significant (P = 0. 05) {{reductions in the}} monitored variables for the moist treatment were observed for 0. 6 – 2. 1 h before, during and 0. 5 – 2. 4 h after the irrigation. The average decreases for the phase during were 1. 8 – 2. 1 °C for air temperature, 0. 53 – 0. 61 kPa for VPD, 3. 1 – 3. 8 °C for canopy temperature, and 0. 22 – 0. 28 mm h− 1 (30 – 36 %) for transpiration. Lower reductions were found for the phases before and after.

Transpiration reduction due to irrigation was higher as closer to the center of the pivot and represented 5 – 7 % of the applied water.
