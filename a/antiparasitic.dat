5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: <b>antiparasitic</b> treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection.

40|$|Between 2004 and 2013, 486 {{suspected}} scavenger poisoning cases, including 24 bearded vultures (Gypaetus barbatus), {{were investigated}} in the Pyrenees and surrounding areas in Spain {{as part of}} a monitoring programme regarding accidental and intentional poisoning of wildlife. Poisoning was confirmed in 36 % of all analysed cases where scavenger species were found dead within the distribution range of bearded vultures. Organophosphates and carbamates were the most frequently detected poisons. Four of the bearded vulture cases were positive for the presence of topical <b>antiparasitics</b> (3 with diazinon and 1 with permethrin). These likely represented accidental exposure due to the legal use of these veterinary pharmaceuticals. In order to confirm the risk of exposure to topical <b>antiparasitics</b> in bearded vultures, pig feet (n = 24) and lamb feet (n = 24) were analysed as these are one of the main food resources provided to bearded vultures at supplementary feeding stations. Pig feet had no detectable residues of topical <b>antiparasitics.</b> In contrast, 71. 4 % of lamb feet showed residues of <b>antiparasitics</b> including diazinon (64. 3 %), pirimiphos-methyl (25. 4 %), chlorpyrifos (7. 1 %), fenthion (1. 6 %), permethrin (0. 8 %) and cypermethrin (27. 8 %). Washing the feet with water significantly reduced levels of these topical <b>antiparasitics,</b> as such, this should be a recommended practice for lamb feet supplied at feeding stations for bearded vultures. Although the detected levels of <b>antiparasitics</b> were relatively low (≤ 1 μg/g), a risk assessment suggests that observed diazinon levels may affect brain acetylcholinesterase and thermoregulation in bearded vultures subject to chronic exposure.

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry Europe 24 th Annual Meeting, celebrado en Basel (Suiza) del 11 al 15 de mayo de 2014. Veterinary {{drugs that}} are {{commonly}} used in livestock production can remain as residues within the carcasses of animals after death. As a result, various scavengers, including vultures, may be exposed {{to a range of}} toxic compounds – the implications of which remain very poorly characterised. Across Asia, exposure to diclofenac through this pathway has caused the near global extinction of at least three species of Old World Gyps vultures. This highlights the urgent need for far better pharmacovigilance and the requirement for improved, more comprehensive life-cycle assessments for the myriad of pharmaceutical products currently in use. Here we present data regarding the exposure of bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) to external <b>antiparasitics</b> in Spain. We have studied 24 suspected poisonings of bearded vultures and the breeding failure of one pair in Aragon (NE Spain) between 2006 and 2013. As evidences were found that external <b>antiparasitics</b> used on livestock were a probable cause of some of these poisonings, 24 feet of pork and 116 feet of lamb were analysed by GC-MS. Brain acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity was measured in the brain when this sample was available. One of the bearded vultures showed diazinon (12 ng/g) in the gastric content, another one showed permethrin (56 ng/g), and lamb feet associated with two other poisonings showed diazinon (28 - 29 ng/g). Brain acetylcholinesterase activity in the bearded vulture with diazinon in the gastric content was 16. 8 μmol/min/g, which is lower than the activity found in another bearded vulture dead by traumatism with 28. 5 μmol/min/g. Pork feet had no residues of external <b>antiparasitics.</b> On the contrary, lamb feet showed residues of diazinon, pirimiphos-methyl, chlorpyrifos, fenthion, permethrin or cypermethrin, with occurrences varying among slaughterhouses (up to 100...|$|R

Chemist, historian and absinthe distiller Ted Breaux has claimed that the alleged secondary effects of absinthe may be caused by {{the fact that some of}} the herbal compounds in the drink act as stimulants, while others act as sedatives, creating an overall lucid effect of awakening.

2500|$|Complex {{plastids}} {{start by}} secondary endosymbiosis (where a eukaryotic organism engulfs another eukaryotic organism {{that contains a}} primary plastid resulting in its endosymbiotic fixation), when a eukaryote engulfs a red or green alga and retains the algal plastid, which is typically surrounded by more than two membranes. In some cases these plastids may be reduced in their metabolic and/or photosynthetic capacity. [...] Algae with complex plastids derived by secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga include the heterokonts, haptophytes, cryptomonads, and most dinoflagellates (= rhodoplasts). Those that endosymbiosed a green alga include the euglenids and chlorarachniophytes (= chloroplasts). The Apicomplexa, a phylum of obligate parasitic protozoa including the causative agents of malaria (Plasmodium spp.), toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma gondii), and many other human or animal diseases also harbor a complex plastid (although this organelle has been lost in some apicomplexans, such as Cryptosporidium parvum, which causes cryptosporidiosis).
