50|$|Most {{artillery}} fuzes are nose fuzes. However, base fuzes {{have been}} used with <b>armour</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>shells</b> and for squash head (HESH or HEP) anti-tank shells. At least one nuclear shell and its non-nuclear spotting version also used a multi-deck mechanical time fuze fitted into its base.|$|R
50|$|Batterie Mirus was {{the largest}} {{artillery}} battery in the Channel Islands. Using four barrels taken from a 1917 Imperial Russian dreadnaught captured in Norway and resting on platforms manufactured by Friedrich Krupp A.G., these 30.5 cm guns had a potential range of 51 km with lightweight high explosive shells, weighing 250 kg or 31 km with the heavier 405 kg <b>armour</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>shells.</b> The battery became operational in June 1942.|$|R
5000|$|The site {{came into}} {{existence}} around 1941 when an armaments factory was built on a greenfield site {{to the north of}} Moseley Old Hall, to manufacture <b>armour</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>shells.</b> The site was in two parts with Hard Metal Tools Ltd (which became Royal Ordnance Speciality Metals) producing tungsten carbide heads, and the explosive and propellants filled at Royal Ordnance Factory Featherstone, (Filling Factory No. 17). [...] "The development also included a hostel for employees at Brinsford Lodge".|$|R
5|$|The {{failure of}} the {{majority}} of the shells to detonate may have had various causes. As the submarines fired <b>armour</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>shells,</b> intended for use against steel ship hulls, the relatively softer brick walls may have failed to trigger the impact fuses. Sea water may have degraded the shells, which the Japanese had stored in deck lockers for several weeks. The age of the shells may also have been a factor; some of the shells recovered from the Newcastle bombardment were found to be of English manufacture; surplus munitions from World War I.|$|R
50|$|Recently, APIS (<b>armour</b> <b>piercing</b> {{incendiary}} <b>shells)</b> {{have been}} used; these penetrate the target using the kinetic {{properties of the}} round before the incendiary round goes off, smothering the crew in flames, cooking off ammunition and igniting combustible materials, generally destroying the target.|$|R
2500|$|On 28 March, an IMAM Ro.43 {{floatplane}} {{launched by}} Vittorio Veneto spotted the British cruiser squadron at 06:35. At 07:55, the Trento group encountered Admiral Pridham-Wippell's cruiser group {{south of the}} Greek island of Gavdos. The British squadron was heading to the south-east. Thinking they were attempting to run from their larger ships, the Italians gave chase, opening fire at 08:12 from [...] The three heavy cruisers fired repeatedly until 08:55, with Trieste firing 132 <b>armour</b> <b>piercing</b> rounds, Trento firing 204 armour-piercing and 10 explosive shells and Bolzano firing another 189 <b>armour</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>shells,</b> but the Italians experienced trouble with their rangefinding equipment and scored no significant hits. HMS Gloucester fired three salvos in return. These fell short but did cause the Italians to make a course change.|$|R
50|$|After the First World War, {{the variety}} of {{ammunition}} was reduced, although an <b>armour</b> <b>piercing</b> HE <b>shell</b> was developed. The main change was introduction of a new streamlined HE shell, 4/7.5 crh, giving a significant improvement in range. In the 1930s, {{the new generation of}} double base propellant, Cordite W, was also adopted.|$|R
50|$|At the time, German (non-light) {{tanks were}} {{expected}} to carry out one of two primary tasks when assisting infantry in breakthroughs, and exploit gaps in the enemy lines where opposition had been removed, moving through and attacking the enemy's unprotected lines of communication and the rear areas. The first task was direct combat against other tanks and other armoured vehicles, requiring the tank to fire <b>armour</b> <b>piercing</b> (AP) <b>shells.</b>|$|R
500|$|On {{either side}} of the terreplein, wide of the 64-pound guns, are two small rooms known as the expense stores. They were used for {{ready-to-use}} ammunition for the adjacent guns, except for <b>armour</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>shells</b> which were stored in the rear-defence wall's archways. Between the 64-pounders and the 10" [...] gun positions are two raised observation platforms set into the structure for gun commanders to spot the fall of outgoing shells. Ranging was either performed from here or from a ranging position set in the sand hills to the fort's north. Between the 10" [...] guns is a T-shaped loading gallery that draws shells and gunpowder via a hoist system from the magazine below. Either side of the gallery was installed the Armstrong mechanical loading systems for the 10" [...] guns. These mechanical systems proved unsuccessful and were removed in the 1890s, though the southern one has been reconstructed. The magazine is accessed from the manning parade and is directly beneath the 10" [...] gun loading gallery. Voice pipes and hoists originally installed have been removed but their remains are visible.|$|R
5000|$|Revenge {{was present}} at the battle of Jutland, where she was under the command of Captain E. B. Kiddle, and served in the {{powerful}} 1st Battle Squadron, second in line behind [...] flying the flag of Vice-Admiral Sir Cecil Burney. The first ship to be engaged by Revenge along with the other ships of the squadron, was the light cruiser, , which had been disabled by the battlecruiser [...] Before the Weisbaden sank, she was able to torpedo the Marlborough, which although already damaged, was able to continue in action. Revenge then engaged the leading German battlecruisers which appeared out of the mist, landing five hits on , two of which caused explosions within the main gun turrets. A single hit was scored on , damaging her superstructure. Finally, Revenge fired her 6-inch batteries against the German 6th and 9th Destroyer Flotillas which had attacked the squadron with torpedoes. Although none of the British ships were hit, in avoiding the incoming torpedoes, the squadron turned away, allowing the German battlecruisers to make good their escape. In the subsequent pursuit, Marlborough had to reduce her speed due to the earlier torpedo damage, so Admiral Burney transferred his flag to Revenge by means of the light cruiser , although the chase eventually had to be abandoned. Revenge had fired 102 <b>armour</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>shells</b> from her main armament and 87 rounds from her 6-inch guns; she also launched a single 21-inch torpedo without result and had fired at the Zeppelin L11 with her 3-inch anti-aircraft guns.|$|R
50|$|Sloping armour can {{increase}} protection by a mechanism such as shattering of a brittle kinetic energy penetrator or a deflection of that penetrator {{away from the}} surface normal, even though the area density remains constant. These effects are strongest when the projectile has a low absolute weight and is short relative to its width. <b>Armour</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>shells</b> of the Second World War, certainly those of the early years, had these qualities and sloped armour was therefore rather efficient in that period. In the sixties however long-rod penetrators were introduced, projectiles that are both very elongated and very dense in mass. Hitting a sloped thick homogeneous plates such a long-rod penetrator will, after initial penetration into the armour's LOS thickness, bend toward the armour's normal thickness and take a path with a length between the armour's LOS and normal thicknesses. Also the deformed penetrator tends {{to act as a}} projectile of a very large diameter and this stretches out the remaining armour, causing it to fail more easily. If these latter effects occur strongly - for modern penetrators this is typically the case for a slope between 55° and 65° - better protection would be provided by vertically mounted armour of the same area density. Another development decreasing the importance of the principle of sloped armour has been the introduction of ceramic armour in the seventies. At any given area density, ceramic armour is also best when mounted more vertically, as maintaining the same area density requires the armour be thinned as it is sloped and the ceramic fractures earlier because of its reduced normal thickness.|$|R
5000|$|The {{built-up}} gun was of an all-steel construction, using a {{radial expansion}} design; {{this was an}} advance on earlier British heavy guns, which employed a wire-wound technology. The resulting gun was lighter, less prone to droop, more accurate and had a significantly longer barrel life. The estimated barrel life was 340 effective full charges. The new 14-inch <b>Armour</b> <b>Piercing</b> (AP) 1,590-pound <b>shell</b> had, relative to its size, superior ballistic performance and armour-penetration compared to previous British shells, due to improvements in design and material which had taken place since World War I. The shell also carried a very large bursting charge of 48.5 lb ...|$|R
50|$|He {{was seriously}} wounded in an aerial battle against some thirty Yak-9s and P-39s on 28 July 1944. Wind shot down one Yak-9 before a 37 mm shell fired by a P-39 {{exploded}} against his seat <b>armour.</b> Another <b>shell</b> <b>pierced</b> the <b>armour</b> glass behind his left shoulder, exploding {{on the instrument}} panel. Wind's left arm was badly wounded. He still managed to fly and land at an airfield even though his plane had been seriously damaged during the attack.|$|R
5000|$|On Bismarck, {{there was}} {{tremendous}} elation at {{the sinking of}} Hood. There was also a keen expectation that they would close on Prince of Wales and possibly finish her off. Bismarcks captain, Ernst Lindemann, requested that Admiral Lütjens allow Bismarck to do just that. Even if British Admiral John Tovey's squadron had left Scapa Flow the previous day, he would still be more than [...] away from Bismarck — even if Bismarck diverted to sink Prince of Wales (a chase Lindemann calculated would take {{only two or three}} hours). Lütjens refused to allow Lindemann to give chase, giving no explanation. Lindemann repeated his request, this time more assertively. Lütjens held firm orders from the German Naval Commander, Groß Admiral Erich Raeder, to avoid unnecessary combat with the Royal Navy, especially when it could lead to further damage that could hasten delivering Bismarck toward the waiting hands of the British. He broke off combat instead of pursuing Prince of Wales and ordered a course of 270°, due west. Bismarck had fired 93 of her 353 base-fused <b>Armour</b> <b>Piercing</b> (AP) <b>shells</b> during the engagement.|$|R
50|$|The ACEC Cobra is a tracked armored {{personnel}} carrier with amphibious capabilities, similar in concept to the BTR-50. It {{was developed by}} Ateliers de Constructions Electriques de Charleroi (ACEC) along with the Belgian Army. The Cobra was the fifth vehicle prototype of an experimental project to create a vehicle with an electric transmission. The electric transmissions made the vehicle lighter and have more room than previous vehicles. The vehicle was completed in October 1985, but never made it into active service because the Cold War ended in 1989/1990.When the Cobra went through performance training in Detroit, the test drivers stated that the electric transmission gave the Cobra equal, if not better, performance and maneuverability than vehicles with mechanical transmissions.The vehicle provided its passengers with protections from small arms fire, small <b>armour</b> <b>piercing</b> projectiles, and <b>shell</b> splinters.|$|R
50|$|As Tampico {{only had}} 100 to 200 4 inch rounds {{at the start}} of hostilities, they {{concluded}} that Captain Malpica may have been preserving his <b>armour</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>shells</b> for when Guerrero came within close range. Two additional life boats went adrift at 9:01 am, a few minutes later Guerrero began to fire salvos. One of the salvos was sighted as hitting the water 500 yards over Tampico, another 1,000 yards over and a final, 2,000 yards over target. None of the shots hit. The Guerrero was still heading for Tampico at 9:14 am when she slowed down and fired some more before coming about to port again at 9:17 am. Lieutenant Chapline, after the action, discovered that Tampico was hit more often than what he and his crew were able to observe. One hit at the starboard bow, close to the unused 6-pounder gun, and exploded within the forecastle. Another struck near the portside 4-inch gun, which apparently damaged the weapon as it was not fired again after about 9:10. When 9:18 am came, a shrapnel shell exploded {{just in front of the}} Tampico. This shell did not seem to harm Malpica's gunboat but the metal fragments killed some of the crew members, standing on deck.A couple minutes later smoke and fire was seen on Tampicos quarterdeck. No attempt was made to extinguish the flames, Tampicos boilers were broken so no pressure was available to push water out of the fire-mains. At 9:42, Captain Malpica ordered his crew to abandon ship. At 9:45 the flames on Tampicos quarterdeck grew larger and much smoke began to cover Tampico. Men aboard the rebel gunboat continued to fire the remaining 4 inch gun as the others left their ship. One of the gunners took up the large Mexican ensign and held it up with his hand until all of the other crew members were safely in life boats. Guerrero continued shooting until 9:50 am when the battle ended. The Tampicos crew, in their boats, began to head for shore so Guerrero proceeded at full speed for the life boats in order to capture the rebels before they could reach shoal water and escape. The Preble took the time to proceed to Tampico to give aid to the crewmen that remained aboard the ship.|$|R
