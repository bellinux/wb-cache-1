5|$|In 1898, in {{response}} to the growing tension with Spain over Cuba, which led to the Spanish–American War, the Cape Florida lighthouse was briefly made U.S. Signal Station Number Four. It was one of 36 along the U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast from Maine to Texas. The Signal Stations were established to provide <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> of any approach of the Spanish fleet.|$|E

5|$|Parallel {{with the}} {{implementation}} of the Dnestr space surveillance units, {{a modified version of the}} original Dnestr units, Dnestr-M radar, was being developed to act as <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> radar to identify attacks by ballistic missiles. The first two were built at Murmansk in northern Russia (Olenegorsk – RO-1) and near Riga in the then Latvian SSR (Skrunda – RO-2). They constituted the beginning of the Soviet SPRN network, the equivalent of the NATO BMEWS.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, {{the castle}} {{structures}} were mostly covered with rubble and debris, interwoven with pathways {{created by the}} movement of visitors over the years. During the Second World War, the castle {{was used by the}} British Army, possibly as <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> site fitted with anti-aircraft searchlights. In an area just {{to the north of the}} castle, the Starfish and Naval decoy sites were created to distract incoming German bombers from the town of Rye itself. Trenches were dug in the north bastion, and military training may have been conducted around the outskirts of the castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the gradual {{escalation}} had given Hanoi time {{to adapt to the}} situation. By 1967, North Vietnam had formed an estimated 25 SAM battalions (with six missile launchers each) which rotated among approximately 150 sites. With the assistance of the Soviet Union, the North Vietnamese had also quickly integrated <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> radar system of more than 200 facilities which covered the entire country, tracking incoming U.S. raids, and then coordinating SAMs, anti-aircraft batteries, and MiGs to attack them. During 1967 U.S. losses totaled 248 aircraft (145 Air Force, 102 Navy, and one Marine Corps).|$|E

5|$|Judy (1936 – 17 February 1950) was a ship's dog {{on board}} HMS Gnat and HMS Grasshopper {{stationed}} on the Yangtze {{before and during}} World War II. She proved able to hear incoming aircraft, providing the crew with <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning.</b> After part of the crew transferred from the Gnat to the Grasshopper in June 1939 the ship was sent to Singapore after the British declaration of war on Germany. There she was on board the ship during the Battle of Singapore, which saw Grasshopper evacuate for the Dutch East Indies. It was sunk en route, and Judy was nearly killed having been trapped by a falling row of lockers. She was rescued when a crewman returned to the stricken vessel looking for supplies.|$|E
5|$|The ruins {{became a}} popular spot for picnics in the 18th and 19th centuries, and was painted by J. M. W. Turner. Plans to redevelop the castle as a Martello tower or as a clubhouse {{for a local}} golf course came to nothing, {{although}} the property {{was used in the}} Second World War, probably as <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> site. Archaeological interest in the fort increased after the war and in 1967 it was taken into the guardianship of the state, the property being bought from the private owners in 1977. It is now operated by English Heritage, who reopened it to visitors after an extensive programme of conservation between 1968 and 1994. The fort is an unusual example of an unmodified Device Fort and is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|After his {{transfer}} to JG 27, Galland met Mölders again. Due to his injuries, Galland could never match Mölders' sharp eyesight; the {{shards of glass}} in his eyes denied him that capacity. However, Mölders, by that time a recognised ace (a pilot with five or more aerial victories), shared what experiences he could with Galland; leadership in the air, tactics and organisation. Mölders was Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 53 {{at the time of}} their meeting. In order for Galland to gain experience on the Bf 109E, which Galland lacked, he offered Galland the chance to join his unit which was flying patrols along the French border. During these sorties, Galland learned Mölders' tactics, such as using spotter aircraft to indicate the position of enemy formation, as <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system. Galland learned to allow the Staffel to operate freely in order to seize the initiative and surprise. Taking his findings back to JG 27, its commander Max Ibel, agreed to their implementation. Galland gained further experience as a combat leader acting as the Gruppenkommandeur, when the Gruppenkommandeur went on leave.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Britain's coastal defences {{depended}} on extensive barriers constructed along the shores, combined {{with large numbers}} of small defensive artillery positions supported by air cover. Several of the Device Forts were brought back into service in this way. Pendennis, St Catherine's, St Mawes and Walmer were equipped with naval gun batteries, Calshot and Hurst were rearmed with naval guns and anti-aircraft defences, and Sandsfoot was used as an anti-aircraft battery. Southsea continued in service, and was involved in Operation Grasp, which seized the French fleet in 1940. Others were used as support facilities; Yarmouth was requisitioned for military use; Portland was used for accommodation, offices and as an ordnance store, and West Cowes used as a naval headquarters for part of the D-Day landings. Camber was used as <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> and decoy site to distract raids from nearby Rye. Early in the war a German bomber destroyed much of the captain's quarters at Deal, forcing William Birdwood to move to Hampton Court Palace. The Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, was appointed as the captain of Walmer Castle during the war, but declined {{to use it as a}} residence, noting that it was too expensive for him to maintain, and that it lay within the range of German artillery.|$|E

40|$|In {{genocide}} scholarship, dehumanization {{is often}} {{considered to be}} <b>an</b> alarming <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> sign for mass systematic killing. Yet, within broader research, dehumanization is found to exist {{in a variety of}} instances that do not lead to aggression or violence. This disparity suggests that while dehumanization {{is an important part of}} the genocidal process, it is too imprecise as <b>a</b> salient <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> sign. Genocide scholars have acknowledged such a conjecture in the past. This article initiates an embryonic research agenda that offers ‘toxification’ as <b>a</b> more precise <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> sign for genocide than dehumanization. It contends that while dehumanization signals that killing members of a particular group may be regarded as permissible, <b>a</b> more indicative <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> is one that flags when extermination is considered a necessity. Following a literature review of dehumanization, the purpose of this article is to introduce the idea of ‘toxificaton’, and to illustrate how the concept can work in practice, using two twentieth century genocides as examples...|$|R
