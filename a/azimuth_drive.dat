The improvement {{was obtained by}} replacing the disturbed reticle sight with a director reticle sight, the sight current generator with a digital processor, and the <b>azimuth</b> <b>drive</b> assembly with a harmonic drive.

50|$|The antennas for the ATA are 6.1 x 7.0 metres (20.0 ft x 23.0 ft) {{hydroformed}} offset Gregorian telescopes, {{each with}} a 2.4 meter sub-reflector with an effective focal length/diameter (f/D) ratio of 0.65. (See DeBoer, 2001). The offset geometry eliminates blockage, which increases efficiency and decreases the side lobes. It also allows for the large sub-reflector, providing good low frequency performance. The hydroforming technology used to make these surfaces {{is the same as}} that used by Andersen Manufacturing of Idaho Falls, Idaho to generate low-cost satellite reflectors. The unique interior frame rim-supported compact mount allows excellent performance at low cost. The drive system employs a spring-loaded passive anti-backlash <b>azimuth</b> <b>drive</b> train.|$|E

This model is used for simulation of elevation and azimuth dynamics, cross-coupled dynamics, and radio-frequency pointing error due to both input commands and wind disturbances. This model {{also serves as a}} tool for the antenna controller design. A modal state-space {{model of the}} antenna structure was obtained from its finite-element model with a free-rotating tipping structure and alidade.

50|$|The {{cameras are}} mounted 1.5 meters {{high on the}} Pancam Mast Assembly. The PMA is {{deployed}} via the Mast Deployment Drive (MDD). The <b>Azimuth</b> <b>Drive,</b> mounted directly above the MDD, turns the assembly horizontally a whole revolution with signals transmitted through a rolling tape configuration. The camera drive points the cameras in elevation, almost straight up or down. A third motor points the Mini-TES fold mirrors and protective shroud, up to 30° above the horizon and 50° below. The PMA's conceptual design was done by Jason Suchman at JPL, the Cognizant Engineer who later served as Contract Technical Manager (CTM) once the assembly was built by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp., Boulder, Colorado. Raul Romero served as CTM once subsystem-level testing began. Satish Krishnan did the conceptual design of the High-Gain Antenna Gimbal (HGAG), whose detailed design, assembly, and test was also performed by Ball Aerospace at which point Satish acted as the CTM.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} elevation and <b>azimuth</b> <b>drive</b> configurations on DSS- 13 antenna performance {{are presented as}} well as a study of gearbox stiffness and motor inertia. Small motor inertia and rigid gearboxes would improve the pointing accuracy up to a certain limit. The limit is imposed by critical values of gearbox stiffness and motor inertia introduced in the article. The critical values depend on the lowest structural frequency of the rate-loop model. The tracking performance can be improved by raising gearbox stiffness to the critical stiffness and reducing motor inertia to the critical inertia. An <b>azimuth</b> <b>drive</b> configuration with four driven wheels was also investigated. For the four-wheel drive configuration in azimuth, the cross-coupling effects are reduced and wind disturbance rejection properties improved. Pointing is improved substantially in the cross-elevation but is relatively unaffected in the elevation direction. More significant improvements can be achieved through either structural redesign (stiffening the structure) or new control algorithms or control concepts, which would eliminate the effect of flexible deformations on the antenna pointing accuracy. Although the study is performed for the DSS- 13 antenna, the results can be extended for other DSN antennas...|$|E

40|$|Reliable and {{cost-effective}} heliostats with high accuracy are {{a prerequisite for}} the successful market introduction of solar tower systems. The advantages of hydraulic drives are high positioning precision, no backlash, ability to go to stow position at electrical power loss and optional overload protection. Initial cost calculations indicated that a cost-competitive solution could be provided. The design of a heliostat with 30 m² mirror area is described. The oil reservoir with pump, the valve bloc and the cylinders for the <b>azimuth</b> <b>drive</b> {{are located in the}} cross bar. The results of wind tunnel measurements with heliostat models of various aspect ratios led to an aspect ratio of 1. 2. A wind fence was not assumed because in the rear part of usual heliostat fields it has no significant advantage as wind tunnel measurements showed. For the canting an automatic procedure will be applied at which the deflectometry method is used for the determination of the shape and orientation of the mirror facets. The first six prototypes will be erected at the Jülich solar tower site, Germany and one at the Plataforma Solar de Almeria, Spain.

Based on the results a cost-benefit-based optimization of the construction and the drives will be carried out...|$|E
40|$|For {{the layout}} of solar {{trackers}} the wind loads on the structure have to be known. They can be calculated by using wind load coefficients given in literature. But so far these values are only valid for aspect ratios of the panel (width to height) of about 1. 0. Therefore the wind load coefficients for heliostats of aspect ratios between 0. 5 and 3. 0 were determined to close this gap. As solar trackers {{are exposed to the}} turbulent atmospheric boundary layer the turbulence of the approaching flow has to be modeled. As a reliable method at reasonable cost wind tunnel measurements were chosen. Solar trackers of 30 m 2 panel size were investigated at a model scale of 1 : 20. Wind direction and elevation angle of the panel were varied to investigate especially the constellations at which the highest wind loads are expected (critical load cases). By spires and roughness elements a wind profile and a turbulence intensity of the modeled wind according to typical sites for solar trackers were achieved. The loads were measured by a high frequency force balance placed underneath the models. Additionally measurements of the pressure distribution on a panel with aspect ratio of 1. 2 were performed to better understand the effects that lead to the peak values of the wind load coefficients. A significant impact of the aspect ratio was measured. For the critical load cases the aspect ratio dependencies of the accordant peak wind load components were determined. By these the peak wind loads on solar trackers of varies aspect ratios can be calculated. Regarding the single solar tracker components the main results are: Higher aspect ratios are advantageous for the dimensioning of the foundation, the pylon and the elevation drive but disadvantageous for the <b>azimuth</b> <b>drive...</b>|$|E

As {{its primary}} physics goal, IAXO will look for axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) originating in the Sun via the Primakoff conversion of the solar plasma photons. In terms of signal-to-noise ratio, IAXO will be about 4 – 5 orders of magnitude more sensitive than CAST, currently the most powerful axion helioscope, reaching sensitivity to axion-photon couplings down to a few × 10 − 12 GeV− 1 and thus probing a large fraction of the currently unexplored axion and ALP parameter space. IAXO will also be sensitive to solar axions produced by mechanisms mediated by the axion-electron coupling gae with sensitivity — {{for the first time}} — to values of gae not previously excluded by astrophysics.

40|$|The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) {{needs to}} {{maintain}} precise {{positioning of the}} optical elements to deliver unprecedented image quality. Any vibration from observatory sources must therefore be minimized; model-based analysis leads to maximum allowable forces from any individual source typically of order a Newton or less in the most sensitive frequency band. Careful attention throughout the design process is needed to ensure that these challenging requirements are satisfied. We focus here in particular on cogging forces from the <b>azimuth</b> motor <b>drive.</b> Each motor yields periodic tangential and vertical forces of order 100 's of Newtons, with higher harmonics of the waveform potentially exciting telescope structural resonances. There are 56 drive motors, and appropriate phasing between them can ideally cancel most of the net torque or net vertical force. However, the moment created between non-collocated forces still produces image motion even if the net force cancels, and further, small errors in forcer positioning result in imperfect cancellation. We provide a general methodology for estimating total cogging forces and then present {{an example of the}} expected TMT performance impact from motor cogging placed in context with the larger challenge of demanding vibration requirement...|$|R
40|$|The more-electric {{trend is}} there in almost all {{the corners of the}} {{automotive}} industry. The same trend is followed by the maritime transportation industry as well and as a result, conventional mechanical transmission based propulsion systems are gradually being overtaken by electric power transmission based propulsion systems. An <b>azimuth</b> thruster <b>driven</b> by an electric motor is a common configuration found in modern electric propulsion systems. Due to the tight speed control and stiff drivetrain in these propulsion systems load transients easily get propagated into the dc-link of the motor drive and subsequently into the upstream power bus as well. These transients can cause disturbances to the other loads connected to the power system. In the worst case, stability of the shipboard power system gets affected by the transients. This paper proposes to use the capacitor-clamped inverter based motor drive itself to absorb such transients and thereby prevent the propagation into the power bus. The efficacy of the proposed concept is verified through computer simulations. Simulation results show that the capacitor-clamped inverter is capable of absorbing load transients without passing them to the upstream power bus...|$|R

The other vector (V2) points {{from the center of the}} feed flat to the object to be tracked, which of course moves across the sky in time. The surface normal of the feed flat mirror is the 3D bisector of vectors V1 and V2, normalized to unity length. If (Nk,Nl,Nm) are the instantaneous unit vector components of the mirror surface normal, then the mirror elevation angle is arcsin(Nl), and the mirror azimuth angle is arcsinNk/cos(Elevation).

Unfortunately, up to now, the use of LNG as marine fuel is mainly hampered {{by the lack of}} appropriate infrastructures for ships bunkering. During the last ten years, LNG, as a bunker fuel, has been introduced in Norway, a true pioneer in marine gas propulsion. Presently it could be also available for ship bunkering in Italy and in several European countries, usually by a tank truck. In this paper the preliminary design of an ASD (<b>Azimuth</b> Stern <b>Drive)</b> tug, for towing and escorting operations (including fire fighting and oil recovery duties) is illustrated. The vessel is characterized by a hybrid propulsion configuration, combining electric drive and gas engines. In fact, each of the two shaft lines is driven by a single LNG engine (Rolls Royce Bergen 2430 kW @ 1000 rpm) and an electric motor/generator (PTI/PTO) coupled through a dedicated gearbox. In Full Gas Mode, the maximum bollard pull and the maximum speed of the tug are respectively about 735 kN and 14 knots, while only the two electric motors, fed by the electrical power supplied by two Diesel generators, allow a cruise speed of at least 8. 5 knots.

40|$|The {{influence}} of maize architectural characteristics on gap fraction (Po) is investigated {{based on a}} 4 D canopy model. This model simulates maize canopies from few input variables: maximum leaf area per plant, maximum number of leaves, plant density, distance between rows, leaf orientation plasticity, maximum height of plant and plant growing stage. A large number of scenes were constructed and the corresponding gap fraction was computed to perform a sensitivity analysis. Results show that leaf <b>azimuth</b> orientation that <b>drives</b> leaf overlapping and thus creates clumping {{appears to be a}} key variable. The effect is maximum for near nadir directions, where gap fraction often tends towards a significant non-zero limit, Pomin, when leaf area index (LAI) is very high. In these conditions, Poisson and extended Poisson models relating Po to LAI are not valid when considering the variation of LAI across development stages. A simple parametric model is proposed Po(θ) =Pomin(θ) +(1 −Pomin(θ)) exp−K(θ) LAI, the two parameters (Pomin(θ) and K(θ)) depending on the architectural characteristics. This model describes with great accuracy the gap fraction across development stages (RMSE = 0. 0135). The sensitivity of parameters Pomin and K to canopy architecture variables was analyzed for the nadir direction, confirming the previous findings. The ensemble of simulations generated for the sensitivity analysis was finally used as a look-up-table (LUT), to estimate Pomin and K values from the 4 D model input variables. This allows to simulate the gap fraction for a large range of maize canopy architecture with high accuracy (RMSE = 0. 0140). Application of this approach is discussed with due attention to light interception by the plants and the monitoring of canopies from remote sensing observations...|$|R
