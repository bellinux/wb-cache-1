5|$|A {{number of}} philosophers, {{including}} Elizabeth Anscombe , Jean Bethke Elshtain , Servais Pinckaers, Iris Murdoch, and the Catholic Encyclopedia, have all {{suggested that the}} Kantian conception of ethics rooted in autonomy is contradictory in its dual contention that humans are co-legislators of morality and that morality is a priori. They <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> something is universally a priori (i.e., existing unchangingly prior to experience), then it cannot also be in part dependent upon humans, who have not always existed. On the other hand, if humans truly do legislate morality, then they are not bound by it objectively, because they are always free to change it.|$|E
5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye-sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Tyrannosaur-inflicted damage has been found on skeletons of hadrosaurs and Triceratops {{that seemed to have}} survived initial attacks. Some researchers <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. The top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics with Tyrannosaurus that only small dromaeosaurs remain as feasible top predators. In this light, scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was an active predator that was willing to scavenge if it could.|$|E
5|$|Like the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, Salamis {{has gained}} {{something}} of a 'legendary' status (unlike, for instance, the more decisive Battle of Plataea), {{perhaps because of the}} desperate circumstances and the unlikely odds. A significant number of historians have stated that Salamis {{is one of the most}} significant battles in human history (though the same is often stated of Marathon). In a more extreme form of this argument, some historians <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Greeks had lost at Salamis, the ensuing conquest of Greece by the Persians would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as we know it. This view is based on the premise that much of modern Western society, such as philosophy, science, personal freedom and democracy are rooted in the legacy of Ancient Greece. Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the domination of much of modern history by Western Civilization, Persian domination of Greece might have changed the whole trajectory of human history. It is also worth mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential Athenian culture occurred only after the Persian wars were won.|$|E

5|$|When {{examining}} Sue, paleontologist Pete Larson found {{a broken}} and healed fibula and tail vertebrae, scarred facial bones and a tooth from another Tyrannosaurus {{embedded in a}} neck vertebra. If correct, these might be strong evidence for aggressive behavior between tyrannosaurs but whether {{it would have been}} competition for food and mates or active cannibalism is unclear. Further recent investigation of these purported wounds has shown that most are infections rather than injuries (or simply damage to the fossil after death) and the few injuries are too general to be indicative of intraspecific conflict. Some researchers <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. Top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics that only small dromaeosaurs and troodontids remain as feasible top predators. In this light, scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators, although they may have had a hard time finding enough meat to scavenge, being outnumbered by smaller theropods. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger like most large carnivores.|$|E
25|$|Young Earth creationists {{interpret}} {{the text of}} Genesis as strictly literal. Young Earth Creationists reject allegorical readings of Genesis and further <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{there was not a}} literal Fall of Man, Noah's Ark, or Tower of Babel this would undermine core Christian doctrines like the birth and resurrection of Jesus Christ.|$|E

25|$|ART was {{traditionally}} {{viewed as}} too expensive in resource-poor settings in developing countries, which {{are believed to}} have a poor capacity for adherence to complicated treatments. However, a 2004 study of 322 outpatient services in Brazilcomprising 87,000 patientsfound the rate of adherence to be 75%. Some authors also <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the decline in hospital admissions and ambulatory care are taken into account, the policy of universal provision of ART has accumulated a net savings of approximately $200 million.|$|E
25|$|On 20 November 2007, Musharraf went to Saudi Arabia as he {{left the}} country {{for the first time since}} {{implementing}} emergency rule. He attempted to convince Saudi Arabia to prevent Sharif from returning until after the elections in January 2008. The political role of Sharif returned to the fore after Benazir Bhutto's return a month earlier. Saudi Arabia appeared to <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Pakistan has allowed a democratic-socialist woman leader, Benazir Bhutto, to return to the country, then the conservative Sharif should be permitted to return too.|$|E

25|$|The {{opinions}} of the Talmudic rabbis are divided between those who seek {{the purpose of the}} mitzvot {{and those who do not}} question them. The latter <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the reason for each mitzvah could be determined, people might try to achieve what they see as the purpose of the mitzvah, without actually performing the mitzvah itself (lishmah), which would become self-defeating. The former believe that if people were to understand the reason and the purpose for each mitzvah, it would actually help them to observe and perform the mitzvah (some mitzvot are given reasons in the Torah).|$|E
25|$|Bureaucratic {{drift in}} American {{political}} science {{is a theory}} that seeks to explain the tendency for bureaucratic agencies to create policy that deviates from the original mandate. While some scholars believe that structural organization can help lessen bureaucratic drift, other scholars have found that this approach can backfire. When a bureaucracy is permeable anyone can access it, including legislators who were originally adverse to the legislation being implemented. Further, scholars <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a bureaucratic agency is designed to represent a single interest, its implementations {{are more likely to}} reflect the views of the people they are representing than they are the views of the legislature.|$|E
25|$|TV3 {{routinely}} {{disagrees with}} RTÉ Television's policy of purchasing US, Canadian and Australian imports which RTÉ subsequently broadcasts after midnight with low audience figures. TV3 <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> made available, it could air such shows in prime-time slots. In the past such shows as Rookie Blue, Rescue Me, Big Love, United States of Tara, Tangle and The Secret Life of Us have been purchased by RTÉ and aired between 00:00 and 06:00 on RTÉ Two. RTÉ {{has argued that}} TV3 has rarely gone after {{the same types of}} imported programming and that such shows perform better than when broadcast in prime time on TV3.|$|E

50|$|In 1984, {{the league}} began {{discussing}} {{the possibility of}} competing head-to-head with the NFL by playing its games in the fall beginning in 1986. The strongest proponents of playing in the fall were Chicago owner Eddie Einhorn and Generals owner Donald Trump. Einhorn and Trump <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the USFL moved to the fall, it would eventually force a merger with the NFL in which the older league would have to admit at least some USFL teams. They also <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a merger did occur, the surviving teams' original investment would more than double.|$|R
25|$|Proponents of {{this theory}} of alien genetic-evolutionary {{intervention}} on Earth <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Greys (or similar beings) were performing genetic manipulations with pre-human life forms on Earth that these aliens may {{have attempted to}} influence the evolution of life forms here in a direction consistent with their own genetic makeup, and similar to their own physiology and general physical structure, since genetically {{that is what they}} would presumably be most familiar with. Counter to this view, the anatomy, physiology, and genetic makeup of primates and humans are extremely similar to other animals on Earth, including those with divergent non-humanoid forms such as sea urchins, sea squirts, and acorn worms.|$|E
25|$|During this process, {{the role}} of the referees is advisory. The {{publisher}} is typically under no obligation to accept the opinions of the referees, though she will most often do so. Furthermore, the referees in scientific publication do not act as a group, do not communicate with each other, and typically are not aware of each other's identities or evaluations. Proponents <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the reviewers of a paper are unknown to each other, the publisher can more easily verify the objectivity of the reviews. There is usually no requirement that the referees achieve consensus, with the decision instead often made by the publisher based on her best judgement of the arguments. The group dynamics are thus substantially different from that of a jury.|$|E
500|$|Operationally, {{the battle}} proved to the Australian high command how {{effective}} armour could be {{when used in}} close co-operation with infantry and in protecting the lines of communication. The use of machine gun carriers {{to carry out the}} wounded had also been quite effective. While the Japanese soldiers and officers on the ground fought bravely, continuing the assault even when it was clear it had failed, ultimately the battle proved to be a decisive Australian victory; however, James notes that poor planning and unreliable communications had also contributed to the result. Long goes on to <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Japanese commander had been more flexible in his tactics, the result might have been different. The Australian right flank had been vulnerable, but Akinaga did not exploit this opportunity.|$|E
