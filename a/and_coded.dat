30|$|The {{present study}} focuses only on law <b>and</b> <b>code</b> <b>and</b> rules {{dimensions}} of ethical climate, {{because the law}} <b>and</b> <b>code</b> <b>and</b> rules dimensions best reflect the essence of ethical climate compared with other three dimensions. Researchers who considered ethical climate as a uni-dimensional concept defined ethical climate as employees’ perceptions {{of the presence of}} a code of ethics, corporate policies on ethics, and top management actions with regard to ethics, such as in Jamarillo et al. (2006) and Schwepker Jr. (2001). This conceptualization of ethical climate was captured in law <b>and</b> <b>code</b> <b>and</b> rules dimensions. In addition, Leung (2008) categorized rules <b>and</b> law <b>and</b> <b>code</b> dimensions as higher levels of ethical climate than the other dimensions. Consequently, the operational definition of ethical climate based on Victor and Cullen’s (1988) law <b>and</b> <b>code</b> <b>and</b> rules dimensions was insurance agents’ shared perceptions of ethical policies, practices, and procedures within the organization.|$|R

However, this added to the performance issues already being caused by the engine's advanced nature, and the team struggled to optimize the game throughout development. 3D polygonal character models were planned, but they could not be implemented on schedule.

The section of the Forgotten Realms world in which Pool of Radiance takes place {{was intended to be}} developed only by SSI.

This game {{was the first}} to use the game engine later used in other SSI D games known as the [...] "Gold Box" [...] series. The SSI team developing the game was led by Chuck Kroegel. Kroegel stated that the main challenge with the development was interpreting the AD rules to an exact format. Developers also worked to balance the graphics with gameplay to provide a faithful AD feel, given the restrictions of a home computer. In addition to the core AD manuals, the books Unearthed Arcana and Monster Manual II were also used during development. The images of monsters were adapted directly from the Monster Manual book. The game was originally programmed by Keith Brors and Brad Myers, and it was developed by George MacDonald. The game's graphic arts were by Tom Wahl, Fred Butts, Darla Marasco, and Susan Halbleib.|$|E

Hall explained, [...] "I call it my new Apple II because it's {{so much fun}} to program in and it takes all the drudgery out of it. It's sort of if you mushed together C, Basic and Java in a way—for programming people it's sort of Windows based. It began as a defined dialogue window, but provided variables so that you could position and move a picture. So from there it grew like UNIX with little bits and pieces, and you have things that initialize data to the window, things that constantly update the window, and things that happen after the window, in little code chunks and with that you can do any little thing." [...] Hall wrote <b>and</b> <b>coded</b> the mini-game Bugaboo for Anachronox in 15 hours to demonstrate the environment's simplicity. Other tools developed for the game were B.E.D. (a battle editor), ION Radiant (for level design, based on QERadiant), NoxDrop (for item and character placement), and Planet (a spline-based camera system coded by Joey Liaw). Ion Storm worked with QuakeEd developer Robert Duffy to create QERadiant, later adapted to ION Radiant. Hall lauded Planet: [...] "you can control entities on paths, trigger events, manipulate particles, and do just about anything you please. One of the more common team beliefs is that the only true limit to Planet is the person controlling it." [...] Hall aimed to provide several end-user modification tools, such as one to allow gamers to create their own MysTech elements. Other programs would allow implementation of new dialogue, voice-acting, and camera work. Ion Storm developed tutorials and documentation for each tool.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Domain-specific {{languages}} (DSLs) are modeling languages {{that are}} customized {{for a specific}} context or project. DSLs allow for fast and precise modeling because the language features and constructs can be precisely tailored based {{on the needs of}} the modeling effort. There exist highly customizable model-editing tools that can be easily configured to support DSLs defined by end-users (e. g., system architects, engineers, and analysts). However, to leverage models created using these tools for automated analysis, simulation, <b>and</b> <b>code</b> generation, endusers must build custom analysis tools <b>and</b> <b>code</b> generators. In contrast to model editors, the implementation and maintenance of these analysis <b>and</b> <b>code</b> generation tools can be tedious and hampers the utility of DSLs. In this paper, we posit that analysis <b>and</b> <b>code</b> generation tools for DSLs are, in fact, isomorphic to model editing tools. The implication of this insight is that model editors, analysis tools, <b>and</b> <b>code</b> generators can be treated as analogs conceptually and architecturally, and highly customizable analysis <b>and</b> <b>code</b> generation tools for DSLs can be built using the same approach that has already proven successful for the construction of DSL model editors.
