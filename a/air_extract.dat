40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The conference was {{organised}} by CIBSE: [URL] {{years have seen}} increased use of natural ventilation, daylighting, and cooling techniques in UK buildings. This paper describes the design and operating concept of a large, naturally ventilated and illuminated city centre library for Coventry University in the UK. The novel design concept includes four lightwells acting as ventilation inlets, {{each of which is}} fed with fresh air from a plenum below the ground floor. A central lightwell and perimeter stacks draw air across each floor plate and provide <b>air</b> <b>extract</b> routes. This strategy enables fresh air to reach the core of the building whilst keeping the external façade sealed for reasons of security and preventing urban noise and pollution. Computer simulation demonstrates that the building is likely to be well ventilated and thermally comfortable. The building and the analyses should increase the confidence of engineers and architects designing sustainable buildings...|$|E
40|$|The {{exposure}} to odorants from animal production facilities creates {{a serious problem}} {{in the form of}} odour annoyance for the surrounding society and thus for the agricultural industry. The identification of the key odour components responsible for the odour annoyance is important in the search for odour reducing methods and could be useful for quantitative purposes as well. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the application of the hyphenated gas chromatography olfactometry technique (GCO) called Detection Frequency Analysis for the identification of key odour components in an odorous air sample collected in a grower/finisher pig house. Detection Frequency Analysis is based on a combination of gas chromatography and a human panel sniffing to odours eluting from the gas chromatographic column.

40|$|We {{describe}} our {{methodology for}} measuring {{a number of}} halogen-containing strong greenhouse gases in air volumes as small as 20 cm³. Gases measured include the very long-lived perfluorocarbon gases CF₄ and C₂F₆ as well as SF₆, and several CFCs. This technique has developed {{for the purpose of}} measuring past atmospheric composition from ice cores, but could be adapted for other purposes. In this study, gases that have been cryogenically collected in cold-fingers, after extraction from dry-crushed ice cores, are re-concentrated on a glass bead-filled trap in a liquid nitrogen headspace. The concentrated gases are desorbed in to a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. The methodology has been tested by transferring air samples of known composition through the trapping and analysis process. We present some exemplars of measurements performed on <b>air</b> <b>extracted</b> from ice from Law Dome, Antarctica. The <b>air</b> <b>extracted</b> is representative of atmospheric composition in the 19 th and early 20 th century. Most of the gases decline to diminishingly small abundances before the beginning of their industrial production in the early 20 th century. We are able to detect abundances as low as 0. 1 pmol mol⁻₁ (ppt), depending on the compound and in some cases below 0. 01 pmol mol⁻₁, despite the small sample size.

40|$|Air, {{subsurface}} soil, and superficial {{dust from}} a National Priorities List landfill located in southern Illinois were sampled {{to determine their}} potential toxicities. The major components of these landfill extracts were polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), with significant amounts of polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and small amounts of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs). The 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) toxic equivalency factor approach has been proposed to estimate the toxic potency of complex mixtures of chlorinated aromatics for environmental risk assessment. However, most components of environmental residues are nonplanar and do not act as aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor agonists, {{so there is a}} great risk of not identifying adverse responses that are not dioxinlike. We used a 2 -day prepubertal female rat bioassay to examine multiple biological responses, including both dioxinlike and nondioxinlike effects from these landfill extracts. As expected, both types of effects were detected. The soil and dust extracts produced similar dose-response relationships for 7 -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, 7 -pentoxyresorufin O-depentylase, 7 -benzyloxyresorufin O-debenzylase, and 4 -nitrophenol UDP-glucuronyltransferase induction; the dose response for the <b>air</b> <b>extract</b> deviated from the other two extracts. Soil, dust, and air extracts effectively reduced serum total thyroxine (T 4) with similar dose-response relationships, despite the significantly different TCDD toxic equivalent (TEQ) values of these three extracts. Both soil (346 mg PCB/kg) and air (175 mg PCB/kg) extracts caused a greater than 30 % increase in uterine wet weight. This study suggests that a more comprehensive approach is required to improve current risk assessment of environmental mixtures. TCDD TEQs reflect only a portion of effects and may especially underpredict effects on T 4...|$|E
40|$|Argon diathermy {{is one of}} many {{different}} types of electro surgical devices used during surgical operations in Sweden {{and the rest of the}} world. When argon diathermy device is used, as when traditional diathermy is used, smoke is generated. This smoke, named surgical smoke, creates an unsuitable workplace environment for the operation team. It smells, sticks in the eyes and it is possible that the smoke is injurious to health. When traditional diathermy is used well developed, <b>air</b> <b>extract</b> device can be used to evacuate the smoke but for argon diathermy the equipment can not be applied to the argon device since it would extract the argon as well as the smoke. This thesis presents particlemeasurements during real state of case operations where argon diathermy is to be used, and analyse weather there is a connection between activation of argon diathermy and an increased concentration of particles in the air. This thesis also investigates the ventilation of the operation theatre were the measurements were performed and a short literature review about particles and personal protective equipment. The measurements were performed with an equipment which measures particles in the interval 0. 02 - 1 micrometer. The measurement probe was located just above the nose of the surgeon during six operations. Audio recording and videotaping during the operations made it possible to study the connection between activation of argon diathermy and increased particles levels. The analysis showed a strong connection between diathermy and the number of particles, an activation is almost always followed by a particles concentration peak. A majority of the particle concentration peaks are as high they reach the measuring maximum of the instrument at. A measure to protect the personnel from exposure of the smoke needs to be done.

40|$|We report {{measurements}} of brominated, bromochlorinated, and iodinated methanes in <b>air</b> <b>extracted</b> from deep firn at three polar locations (two Antarctic and one Arctic).

This indicates a steady increase by about 2 ppt from the midtwentieth century to 8 ppt today. The Arctic firn, however, contained extremely high levels of methyl bromide as well as numerous other organic gases, which are evidently produced in situ. The other brominated species (dibromomethane, bromochloromethane, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform) showed little or no long-term trend in Antarctic firn and therefore are evidently of entirely natural origin in the Southern Hemisphere. A clear seasonal trend was observed in the upper firn for the shortest-lived halocarbons (notably bromoform and methyl iodide). The same species were present at lower abundance at the higher altitude and more inland Antarctic site, possibly due to their origin from more distant oceanic sources. ...|$|R

Together, the ice core and firn air data provide evidence for presence of modern air entrapped in shallow ice core samples. We propose that this is due to closure of open pores after drilling, entrapping modern air and resulting in elevated CFC- 12 mixing ratios. Our measurements reveal the presence of open porosity below the depth at which firn air samples can be collected and demonstrate how the composition of bubble air in shallow ice cores can be altered during the post-drilling period through purely physical processes.

Consequently, the objective of this project was to develop a new technique for simultaneous determination of mixing ratios of CO_ 2, CH_ 4, N_ 2 O, and CO in <b>air</b> samples <b>extracted</b> from ice cores and to apply this technique to studies on different ice cores. The technique consists of three steps: Extraction of the air from the ice sample, transfer of the air into the absorption cuvette of the spectrometer, and the analysis by frequency modulated tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer (FM-TDLAS). The developed FM-TDLAS-spectrometer is capable to detect 2 ppbv CO, 22 ppbv CH_ 4, and 1 ppbv N_ 2 O in air sample of 2 cm" 3 (STP). This is sufficient to resolve the changes of mixing ratios of these gases and of CO_ 2, whose detection limit is much better than needed, during the last 100. 000 years. The development of the extraction techniques was focused on the sublimation of the ice sample. The <b>air</b> <b>extracted</b> by this technique was contaminated by all four gases and this has so far prevented a reliable determination of these gases.
