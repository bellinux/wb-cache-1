40|$|Triaxial experiments, at {{confining}} {{pressures in}} the range 0 - 13. 79 Mpa, have been performed on glacial ice collected from four icebergs and one glacier. Tests were conducted at strain rates {{in the range}} of 5 x 10 (- 5) to 5 x 10 (- 2) s(- 1) and at four temperatures {{in the range of}} - 1 degree to - 16 degrees C. Depending on test conditions, the ice failed by one of four possible modes: ductile deformation, due to extensive non-interacting microcracks; fracture along <b>a</b> <b>shear</b> <b>plane</b> followed by continuous or stick-slip sliding; large-scale brittle fracture; and combined ductile and shear-plane fracture and slip. The strength increased with decreasing temperature, increasing strain rate up to 5 x 10 (- 2) s(- 1) was lower than 5 x 10 (- 3) s(- 1) probably because extension and interaction of microcracks is enhanced at the higher rate. For higher confining pressures at - 1 degree C, the strength decreased due to freezing point depression. The ice from the different sources exhibited different mean uniaxial compressive strenghts.

Thermal spraying is one of many surface modification technologies that are widely used to prepare coatings made of titanium compouds or titanium-containing composite materials.

The unlubricated tribological behavior of coated samples held against a stationary specimen of sintered polycrystalline alumina was characterized. Tribological behavior under mixed/boundary lubrication conditions was characterized with coated rotating specimens using different lubricants at a temperature of 170 °C and a load of 50 N (sliding speed of 0. 3 m/s and total sliding distance of 24 km).

5000|$|As earthflows {{are usually}} water-dependent, {{the risk of}} one {{occurring}} is much higher in humid areas especially {{after a period of}} heavy rainfall or snowmelt. [...] The high level of precipitation, which saturates the ground and adds water to the slope content, increases the pore-water pressure and reduces the shearing strength of the material.

40|$|The Larzac Plateau is {{delimited by}} {{vertical}} cliffs whose geometry {{is controlled by}} vertical joints. Cliff’s erosion involves landslides initiated by incremental enlargement of joints that progressively detach rock columns at very low velocities (1. 2 mm/yr). We find that enlargement of joints is linked to intraseasonal thermal cycles ranging between 2 - 15 days in relation with dilation/contraction of rock blocks trapped inside the joints. The mechanism involves two successive stages in which blocks create a wedging and a ratcheting effect on the rock column. Wedging is associated with compressional forces acting on the rock column, resulting from temperature increase and dilation of the shallow rocks. Ratcheting is associated with downward displacement of blocks by gravity to a new equilibrium position, resulting from temperature decrease and contraction of shallow rocks. The displacement vector in a thermal cycle is split into a plastic and a thermal component; plastic displacements range between 10 — 200 μm according to the seasons, and are absorbed along <b>a</b> <b>shear</b> <b>plane</b> dipping ~ 40 ° beneath the rock column: they are largest during autumn and winter, minor during spring and negligible in summer.

40|$|AbstractAlthough many intact rock types {{can be very}} strong, a {{critical}} confining pressure can eventually be reached in triaxial testing, such that the Mohr shear strength envelope becomes horizontal. This critical state has recently been better defined, and correct curvature or correct deviation from linear Mohr–Coulomb (M-C) has finally been found. Standard shear testing procedures for rock joints, using multiple testing of the same sample, in case of insufficient samples, can be shown to exaggerate apparent cohesion. Even rough joints {{do not have any}} cohesion, but instead have very high friction angles at low stress, due to strong dilation. Rock masses, implying problems of large-scale interaction with engineering structures, may have both cohesive and frictional strength components. However, it is not correct to add these, following linear M-C or nonlinear Hoek–Brown (H-B) standard routines. Cohesion is broken at small strain, while friction is mobilized at larger strain and remains {{to the end of the}} shear deformation. The criterion ‘c then σn tan φ’ should replace ‘c plus σntan φ’ for improved fit to reality. Transformation of principal stresses to <b>a</b> <b>shear</b> <b>plane</b> seems to ignore mobilized dilation, and caused great experimental difficulties until understood. There seems to be plenty of room for continued research, so that errors of judgement of the last 50 years can be corrected...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of shear textures and band-like {{features in the}} microstructure of commercially pure (CP) aluminum have been studied {{as a function of}} backpressure and die relief angle during equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) through a die with a 90 ◦ die channel angle. Microtexture data were acquired by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) following one pass and four repetitive passes by route A. In a 90 ◦ die with zero relief angle, the microtexture data indicate that ECAP involves simple shear on <b>a</b> <b>shear</b> <b>plane</b> and in a shear direction that are rotated away from the plane of the die channel intersection toward the die exit channel. This rotation reflects the spreading of shear deformation through a fan-shaped region around the plane of the die channel intersection. The superposition of backpressure suppresses this spreading and the texture data indicate that deformation is confined to the plane of the die channel intersection, while the introduction of a relief angle at the outer corner of the die channel intersection promotes spreading and leads to further rotation of the shear plane and shear direction toward the axis of the die exit channel. Splitting of shear texture components is observed after the initial ECAP pass. Such splitting appears in the microstructure as band-like features separated by sub-grains. Band-like features became apparent in the microstructure after the initial pass and persisted through four ECAP passes by route A; these features become more prominent with increasing die relief angle...|$|E
