5|$|During Borobudur excavation, archeologists {{discovered}} colour pigments of blue, red, green, black, {{as well as}} bits of gold foil, {{and concluded}} that the monument that we see today — a dark gray mass of volcanic stone, lacking in colour — was probably once coated with varjalepa white plaster and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> <b>of</b> Buddhist teaching. The same vajralepa plaster can also be found in Sari, Kalasan and Sewu temples. It is likely that the bas-reliefs of Borobudur was originally quite colourful, before centuries of torrential tropical rainfalls peeled-off the colour pigments.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Kemp {{continued}} to be considered along with Reagan as the politician most responsible {{for the implementation of}} supply-side tax cuts and along with Steve Forbes as the political figure most responsible for their continued place in the marketplace of political ideas. He has been described as <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> <b>of</b> economic conservatism and a hero for his urban agenda. Today, he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal conservatives who believe that free markets and low taxes work better than government bureaucracies. Kemp was considered the leader of the progressive conservatives who adhere to the hard right on social issues, but avoid protectionist fiscal and trade policy.|$|E

Ralph breaks free, hits the mountain, and causes it to erupt, but Vanellope saves him using her glitch. The volcanic beacon destroys the Cy-Bugs and Turbo.|$|E

25|$|The UK {{played an}} {{important}} role in the drafting of the Convention, with figures such as Arthur Goodhart, John Foster and the UK-based Hersch Lauterpacht providing the impetus for the creation of the Council of Europe in 1949 as a means of guarding against the rise of new dictatorships and to provide the citizens of Soviet-occupied countries with <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> <b>of</b> hope.|$|E

25|$|In the {{introductory}} paragraph, Colet concludes {{by stating that}} his presence {{is due to the}} need for the Council to consider a Church reformation. First, Colet criticises the living style of the priests. Colet explains that the priests should set an example for others as be <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> <b>of</b> light, because if they are instead figures of darkness, the Church will be engulfed by darkness. Colet cites four evils, referencing the Apostle, that constitute the corrupt, priestly living: devilish pride, carnal concupiscence, worldly covetousness, and worldly occupations.|$|E
25|$|Under the Caliphate of Córdoba, al-Andalus was <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> <b>of</b> learning, and {{the city}} of Córdoba, the largest in Europe, became one of the leading {{cultural}} and economic centres throughout the Mediterranean Basin and the Islamic world. A number of achievements that advanced Islamic and Western science came from al-Andalus, including major advances in trigonometry (Geber), astronomy (Arzachel), surgery (Abulcasis), pharmacology (Avenzoar), and other fields. Al-Andalus became a major educational center for Europe and the lands around the Mediterranean Sea as well as a conduit for culture and science between the Islamic and Christian worlds.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the hardships}} and privations, Halberstam was <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> <b>of</b> {{strength}} {{and hope for}} his fellow prisoners. When one died in the infirmary—hardly a noteworthy occurrence in those days—the Rebbe stood up and eulogized him for having been a great Torah scholar in Hungary. He refused to eat non-kosher food or food cooked in the non-kosher kitchen, subsisting only on bread and water during his nine months in Muldorf. Moreover, he would not eat the bread until he had ritually washed his hands, and would often wait for days to find some water for this purpose. One prisoner watched him stand beside the cement mixer {{for hours at a}} time, collecting the drops of water that dripped from the tank.|$|E

5000|$|The mysterious {{voice that}} tells Hand to steal Atrocitus' weapon for himself traps him under its thrall and {{influences}} him into resenting the Green Lanterns. <b>As</b> <b>beacons</b> <b>of</b> light, they upset the perfect balance {{of darkness and}} death. Trying to extinguish the light of willpower but unwilling to fight Green Lantern as an [...] "average joe", Hand sews himself a costume using a family cadaver pouch and begins calling himself [...] "Black Hand". Jordan apparently never connects William and his energy-absorbing weapon to his earlier fight with Atrocitus (believing {{it to be an}} original creation). Never revealing his weapon's true origin, Black Hand continues to fight him over the years, always retreating to a desecrated grave after each failure. There, he lies with the corpses, hoping for peace and release.|$|R
500|$|In 2005, O'Brien {{started writing}} a book on Madonna, where she wanted to look at her life and work, as the artist was {{approaching}} the age of fifty. She believed that the general public was eager to know the real-self of Madonna, and she concentrated on finding that out. According to her, [...] "the popular negative stereotype about the artist is that of a publicity-hungry, manipulative ball-breaker, while for many woman she is <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> <b>of</b> feminism. I have always found her work clear and autobiographical, but her personality complex and disarmingly changeable." ...|$|E

In spite of its lost world location, the Crown has been <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> <b>of</b> gastronomic adventure for at least 30 years – those with long memories will recall Stephen Bull carving out his reputation here." [...] He said of the food, [...] "There is clearly a distinctive palate at work here. In lesser hands, such a meal could be not so much a car crash as a multiple pile-up, but it is not, because the ingredients are handled with originality, assurance and, more importantly, a keen sense of pleasure." ...|$|E
50|$|The high {{visibility}} of the fell {{made it an}} ideal location for <b>a</b> warning <b>beacon.</b> <b>A</b> <b>beacon</b> on the fell has been recorded as early as 1002.

More recently, beacon chains have been lit in celebration of coronations and jubilees.|$|R

The Washington Post devoted four pages to its profile of Diệm and titled it [...] "DiệmSymbol of Free New Asia."

The New York Times praised the visiting president for [...] "advancing {{the cause of}} freedom and democracy in Asia". The Boston Globe dubbed him [...] "Vietnam's Man of Iron". Various papers favourably commented on Diệm's overt opposition to communism, juxtaposing it to non-aligned Asian leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru of India and Sukarno of Indonesia. Nehru and Sukarno attempted {{to steer clear of}} both the US-led anti-communist world and the Soviet bloc, and sought to recruit other countries into their movement.

500|$|There was {{a strong}} {{reaction}} from the show's viewers. Adler said, [...] "I've heard {{from a lot of}} fans how important this character is for them because it's important to watch the internal struggle, the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted." [...] He wants Karofsky to [...] "accept himself and come out because [...] it would be <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> <b>of</b> hope for everyone else who's struggling", and noted, [...] "people do get hope from Glee." [...] He also said, [...] "I think [...] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is one heck of a compliment from him." [...] Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, [...] "This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But I also love Max and I love that character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending." [...] At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as [...] "very powerful. Chilling, terrifying, horrifying, yet, at the same time, heartbreaking. … Because there are kids who have messaged me since that episode saying they used to hear that line spoken to them {{day in and day out}} at school", and they dreaded school because of it.|$|E
