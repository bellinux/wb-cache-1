40|$|Background: Development of {{technologies}} and high pace of changes made a modern organization {{highly dependent on}} the expertise and assistance of technology specialists. To {{be able to compete}} and be cost efficient, {{but at the same time}} be on the cutting-edge of technology development, is an essential requirement for doing business in the contemporary world. Moreover, this requirement became a solid ground for the emergence of a technical consulting industry and a new type of human resources - <b>technical</b> <b>consultants.</b> On the one hand, <b>technical</b> <b>consultants</b> are the main resources of technical consulting organizations, but on the other hand, <b>technical</b> <b>consultants</b> can cause harm to technical consulting organization, particularly, in the case of voluntary turnover.

Results: <b>Technical</b> <b>consultants</b> are a type of knowledge workers with non-traditional work arrangements.
