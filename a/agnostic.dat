5|$|Although Du Bois {{attended}} a New England Congregational {{church as a}} child, he abandoned organized religion while at Fisk College. As an adult, Du Bois described himself as <b>agnostic</b> or a freethinker, {{but at least one}} biographer concluded that Du Bois was virtually an atheist.Lewis, p. 550 (<b>agnostic,</b> atheist).Johnson, passim (<b>agnostic).</b> However, another analyst of Du Bois's writings concluded that he had a religious voice, albeit radically different from other African-American religious voices of his era, and inaugurated a 20th-century spirituality to which Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, and James Baldwin also belong.|$|E
5|$|Others have redefined this concept, {{making it}} {{compatible}} with forming a belief, and only incompatible with absolute certainty. George H. Smith, while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word, and admitting that the broad definition of <b>agnostic</b> was the common usage definition of that word, promoted broadening {{the definition of}} atheist and narrowing the definition of <b>agnostic.</b> Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as <b>agnostic</b> atheism (the view {{of those who do}} not believe in the existence of any deity, but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist) and <b>agnostic</b> theism (the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).|$|E

5|$|Extracts of {{the speech}} {{appeared}} in The New Yorker on June 10. Several weeks later, The New York Times printed the whole text, quickly followed by Life magazine and Reader's Digest. Hand's message that liberty is safeguarded by everyday Americans struck a popular chord, and he suddenly found himself a folk hero. Though he enjoyed the acclaim, he thought it unmerited. His biographer Gerald Gunther, noting the paradox of the <b>agnostic</b> Hand's use of religious overtones, suggests that the most challenging aspect {{of the speech}} was {{that the spirit of}} liberty must entertain doubt.|$|E

5|$|Sunday never {{attended}} seminary {{and made}} no pretense of being a theologian or an intellectual, {{but he had a}} thorough knowledge of the Bible and was well read on religious and social issues of his day. His surviving Winona Lake library of six hundred books gives evidence of heavy use, including underscoring and reader's notes in his characteristic all-caps printing. Some of Sunday's books were even those of religious opponents. He was later charged with plagiarizing a Decoration Day speech given by the noted <b>agnostic</b> Robert Ingersoll.|$|E
5|$|Being a scientist, {{above all}} else, Huxley {{presented}} agnosticism {{as a form}} of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. Karl Popper would also describe himself as an <b>agnostic.</b> According to philosopher William L. Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as <b>agnostic.</b> Pears said that when they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E
