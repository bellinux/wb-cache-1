40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a new throughput-based {{transmit}} antenna selection (AS) scheme is evaluated. First, a closed-form {{solution for the}} throughput rate of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, with a truncated selective <b>repeat</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>request</b> (TSR-ARQ) or selective <b>repeat</b> plus go-back-N <b>automatic</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>request</b> (SR+GBN-ARQ) protocol at the data link layer, is proposed. In addition, a throughput-based AS technique with adaptive modulation is also investigated. For this purpose, the throughput and packet error rates of a MIMO system with a transmit AS and TSR-ARQ protocol at the data link layer are analyzed. This study is conducted in 2 dierent cases. In the single-transmit AS case, the probability density functions (PDFs) of the throughput and packet error rates at the data link layer are derived. Moreover, in the case with multiple-transmit AS, a lower bound for the throughput rate and an upper bound for the packet error rate at the data link layer are determined. Consequently, the PDFs of these lower and upper bounds are extracted.

40|$|Abstract—The {{next-generation}} mobile {{communications system}} is anticipated to support very high-speed data rates exceeding several tens megabits per second. In this paper, we consider high-speed downlink packet access for direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) as in third–generation wideband code-division multiple-access systems. Adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), multicode operation and hybrid <b>automatic</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>request</b> (HARQ) will be the enabling technologies. With such high-speed data transmissions, however, multicode operation severely suffers {{from the loss of}} orthogonality among the spreading codes since the wireless channel becomes severely frequency-selective. In this paper, we apply frequency-domain equalization (FDE) based on minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion instead of conventional rake combining for receiving the packet. A new MMSE-FDE weight is derived for packet combining. The throughput in a frequency-selective Rayleigh-fading channel is evaluated by computer simulation for Chase combining and incremental redundancy (IR) packet combining. It is shown that the use of MMSE-FDE for the reception of multicode DS-CDMA packet gives an improved throughput irrespective of the channel’s frequency-selectivity.
