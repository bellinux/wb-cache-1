5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the {{introduction}} of caustic soda and other industrial chemicals into the process, which not only gets into the environment and water supply, can also directly poison artisans who do not handle it properly.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the teller. The who, what, where, when, and why of the reporter. The media bias. How the {{messenger}} shapes the facts. What journalists call The Gatekeeper. How the presentation is everything.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> {{that the}} British {{successfully}} waged economic warfare by counterfeiting Continentals {{on a large}} scale. Benjamin Franklin later wrote: ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> {{the time}} lag between {{antidepressant}} biological action and therapeutic benefit. Studies showed the neurotransmitter changes occurred within hours, yet therapeutic benefit took weeks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> {{a profusion}} of windows. When moving around the Prograph workspace, the IDE {{generally}} required a new window to be opened to see the contents of methods.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the {{effectiveness}} of shear reinforcement. FRP rebar stirrups formed by bending before hardening generally perform relatively poorly in comparison to steel stirrups or to structures with straight fibres. When strained, the zone between the straight and curved regions are subject to strong bending, shear, and longitudinal stresses. Special design techniques are necessary {{to deal with such}} problems.|$|E
25|$|Although localizationist {{approaches}} {{provide a}} useful way of classifying the different patterns of language difficulty into broad groups, {{one problem is}} that a sizeable number of individuals do not fit neatly into one category or another. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that the categories, particularly the major ones such as Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, still remain quite broad. Consequently, even amongst individuals who meet the criteria for classification into a subtype, there can be enormous variability {{in the types of}} difficulties they experience.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> {{bringing}} the krill catch on board. When the full net is hauled {{out of the}} water, the organisms compress each other, resulting in great loss of the krill's liquids. Experiments {{have been carried out}} to pump Antarctic krill, while still in water, from the cod end of the net through a large tube on board. This method had already been used by the small fishing boats in Japanese waters; it increases the capture capacity and the processing rate of krill.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> {{the start}} of Derby County Football Club in 1895. The {{baseball}} club itself lasted until 1898. The Baseball Ground continued to be used under that name {{as the home of}} Derby County F.C. until 1997.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> the {{isolation}} of such castles. The withdrawal of armed foot soldiers into the castle was hampered by the terrain; {{all the more so}} for cavalry. Its control over the surrounding region was therefore not always adequate.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> {{that one}} of the stamps, for boltwoodite, had an error in its {{chemical}} equation. This was corrected in the Namibian issue. Namibia has issued regular definitive and commemorative stamps since independence in 1990, NamPost being its postal authority.|$|R
25|$|It is unclear, though, how John {{might have}} {{had access to the}} works of the Rhineland mystics. These works were only {{translated}} into Latin {{in the second half of}} the sixteenth century. This means that copies would hardly have been easily available for John. In addition, if it is acknowledged that an influence on John was Francisco de Osuna (who clearly cannot have read the Rhineland mystics since they were not known in Spain in the 1520s), then <b>another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> raised.|$|E
25|$|Yet <b>another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> {{bringing}} the krill catch on board. When the full net is hauled {{out of the}} water, the organisms compress each other, resulting in great loss of the krill's liquids. Experiments {{have been carried out}} to pump krill, while still in water, through a large tube on board. Special krill nets also are currently under development. The processing of the krill must be very rapid since the catch deteriorates within several hours. Its high protein and vitamin content makes krill quite suitable for both direct human consumption and the animal-feed industry.|$|E
25|$|Improvements in {{infrastructure}} {{and the regional}} economy notwithstanding, the three provinces remain one of the poorer regions of Canada. While urban areas are growing and thriving, economic adjustments have been harsh in rural and resource-dependent communities, and emigration has been an ongoing phenomenon for {{some parts of the}} region. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> seen in the lower average wages and family incomes within the region. Property values are depressed, resulting in a smaller tax base for these three provinces, particularly when compared with the national average which benefits from central and western Canadian economic growth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> {{that one}} of the stamps, for boltwoodite, had an error in its {{chemical}} equation. This was corrected in the Namibian issue. Currently Artists Jonny Skolnick and Eli Fenyes are responsible for philatelic design and have oversight over postage stamp images.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> {{with the}} rear suspension, which {{although}} slightly modified to allow clearer airflow {{from the rear}} of the sidepods, it was still directly in the path of the exiting air, which affected the stability of the back of the car, causing oversteer.|$|R
50|$|A {{few years}} later, <b>another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> {{posed by the}} {{construction}} of the Süd Autobahn (1961-1963), which crosses the first pipeline four times between Bad Vöslau and Bad Fischau. Precautions had to be taken to protect the pipeline from the potential effects of traffic accidents.|$|R
25|$|While {{there are}} about 38 bars and 10 men’s clubs known to police that report good business, they also create {{problems}} for the area. Many are linked to illicit activities such as prostitution, both male and female, which noticeable on the streets after 10 pm seven days a week. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> “tarjeteros”, who crowd the area’s streets day and night (especially Genova Street), handing out cards and flyers to passersby advertising bars, clubs and other businesses. While this activity is legal, these tarjeteros {{have been accused of}} bothering area visitors and being associated with small-scale drug trafficking.|$|E
25|$|The {{maintenance}} of the canal was {{a real problem for}} the descendants of Riquet. Despite many precautions, the canal silts up with silt from the water supply. In addition it fills with the branches and leaves of trees. Every winter, a period of closure allows the cleaning of the canal. It is necessary to re-dig the canal bed every year for two months. These works are expensive and two months is not always sufficient. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the invasion of the canal by weeds in the levels and spillways. There is no way to eradicate this scourge. In 1820 dredging was set up to pull up the weeds and the mud layer.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{was written}} to {{entertain}} the Japanese court of the eleventh century, the work presents many difficulties to modern readers. First and foremost, Murasaki's language, Heian period court Japanese, was highly inflected and had very complex grammar. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that naming people was considered rude in Heian court society, so none of the characters are named within the work; instead, the narrator refers to men often by their rank or their station in life, and to women often {{by the color of}} their clothing, or by the words used at a meeting, or by the rank of a prominent male relative. This results in different appellations for the same character depending on the chapter.|$|E
50|$|The main {{remaining}} {{problem for}} Mac OS X was {{the presence of}} rogue routers, such as wrongly configured Windows Internet Connection Sharing devices pretending to have IPv6 connectivity, while 6to4 tunneled IPv6 traffic is blocked at a firewall. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> pre-10.50 versions of Opera.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> has <b>been</b> {{an uneven}} {{distribution}} of health personnel, with rural areas favored over cities.|$|R
50|$|Brooks {{and other}} {{manufacturers}} now worked on improving the spinning frame. The principal {{cause for concern}} was {{the design of the}} Booth-Sawyer spindle. The bobbin did not fit tightly on the spindle and vibrated wildly at higher speeds. Howard & Bullough of Accrington used the Rabbath spindle, which solved these <b>problems.</b> <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> ballooning, where the thread built up in an uneven manner. This was addressed by Furniss and Young of Mellor Bottom Mill, Mellor by attaching an open ring to the traverse or ring rail. This device controlled the thread, and consequently a lighter traveller could be made which could operate at higher speeds. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> the accumulation of fluff on the traveller breaking the thread - this was eliminated by a device called a traveller cleaner.|$|R
25|$|The most {{underdeveloped}} mass ceramics area is in tableware, porcelain and stoneware. Mexico {{has only}} two major tableware manufacturers, Anfora and Santa Anita, which produce porcelain and stoneware respectively. Anfora {{is the only one}} that has been successful in exporting its goods to US companies including Panera Bread, Pottery Barn and Starbucks. Most of these ceramics are imported from other countries such as the United States, Japan and Germany despite its ability to produce it itself. However, the lack of certain raw materials may partially explain this. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the continued production of lead glazed ware, which cannot be exported. While lead free and low lead glazes have been developed for use with low temperature firing, the most traditional, only about half of artisans use it.|$|E
25|$|A {{technical}} {{concern is}} that the 14 MeV neutrons produced by the fusion reactions will damage the materials from which the reactor is built. Research is in progress to determine whether and how reactor walls can be designed to last long enough to make a commercial power station economically viable {{in the presence of the}} intense neutron bombardment. The damage is primarily caused by high energy neutrons knocking atoms out of their normal position in the crystal lattice. A related problem for a future commercial fusion power station is that the neutron bombardment will induce radioactivity in the reactor material itself. Maintaining and decommissioning a commercial reactor may thus be difficult and expensive. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that superconducting magnets are damaged by neutron fluxes. A new special research facility, IFMIF, is planned to investigate this problem.|$|E
25|$|Slower {{degeneration}} of {{the distal}} segment {{than that which}} occurs in the peripheral nervous system also contributes to the inhibitory environment because inhibitory myelin and axonal debris are not cleared away as quickly. All these factors contribute {{to the formation of}} what is known as a glial scar, which axons cannot grow across. The proximal segment attempts to regenerate after injury, but its growth is hindered by the environment. It {{is important to note that}} central nervous system axons have been proven to regrow in permissive environments; therefore, the primary problem to central nervous system axonal regeneration is crossing or eliminating the inhibitory lesion site. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that the morphology and functional properties of central nervous system neurons are highly complex, for this reason a neuron cannot be functionally replaced by one of another type (Llinás' law).|$|E
50|$|The first <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> {{that despite}} {{economic}} resurgence, the state hardly received higher income. <b>another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> that the modest {{capacity of the}} domestic industry was reaching its limits. Further investments and foreign capital were required to install new capabilities and continue with economic growth and recovery. This led to increased dependency on foreign loans and investments.|$|R
500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> the rifles {{issued to}} the 5th USCC. These were muzzle loaded Enfield {{infantry}} rifles unsuited for mounted use {{because they could}} not be loaded on horseback. Carpenter taught tactics that involved dismounted fighting, going back to the concept of [...] "mounted infantry" [...] who dismounted to fight.|$|R
30|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> the classifier. Current {{scholars}} tend to {{use either}} artificial neural network (ANN) or support vector machine (SVM). Nevertheless, {{both of them are}} sensitive to outliers and noises. That means, if the training set contains noises or outliers, the classifier will still treat it as important as normal data.|$|R
25|$|While {{this method}} greatly {{improves}} {{the chances that}} an attack will be successful, it is not without problems. Exploits using this technique still must rely on some amount of luck that they will guess offsets on the stack that are within the NOP-sled region. An incorrect guess will usually result in the target program crashing and could alert the system administrator to the attacker's activities. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that the NOP-sled requires a much larger amount of memory in which to hold a NOP-sled {{large enough to be}} of any use. This can be a problem when the allocated size of the affected buffer is too small and the current depth of the stack is shallow (i.e. there is not much space {{from the end of the}} current stack frame to the start of the stack). Despite its problems, the NOP-sled is often the only method that will work for a given platform, environment, or situation; as such it is still an important technique.|$|E
25|$|The shelters {{are made}} from aluminum, steel, and glass. Air {{ventilation}} works through fins on the aluminum part of the shelters. Floors {{are made from}} tread plate, although newer shelters now use concrete. The shelters are equipped with platform screen doors. Some of the connecting elevated bridge ramps have gentle slopes (with some exceptions) to accommodate the disabled. One disadvantage {{of some of the}} ramps is that passengers need to walk a relatively long way up the ramps and then double back to reach the boarding shelters. The floors of the bridge are mostly tread plates although some are made from concrete. One problem with the tread plate is that considerable noise is generated by the movement of passengers across the tread plate surfaces. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that some of the tread plate surfaces can become very slippery during the rainy season. There are no sanitary facilities in most of the shelters.|$|E
25|$|Flaming {{is done to}} {{loops and}} straight-wires in {{microbiology}} labs. Leaving the loop in the flame of a Bunsen burner or alcohol lamp until it glows red ensures that any infectious agent is inactivated. This is commonly used for small metal or glass objects, but not for large objects (see Incineration below). However, during the initial heating infectious material may be sprayed from the wire surface before it is killed, contaminating nearby surfaces and objects. Therefore, special heaters have been developed that surround the inoculating loop with a heated cage, ensuring that such sprayed material does not further contaminate the area. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that gas flames may leave carbon or other residues on the object if the object is not heated enough. A variation on flaming is to dip the object in 70% or higher ethanol, then briefly touch the object to a Bunsen burner flame. The ethanol will ignite and burn off rapidly, leaving less residue than a gas flame.|$|E
50|$|Reasons for loss: Despite having {{many more}} people visit their fish and chip store, the girls failed to bring in big donors and focused more on the public customers. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> that Layla and Prinnie who were {{assigned}} to cooking focused solely on that and raised $165 and $2000-$3000 respectively.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> the rifles {{issued to}} the 5th USCC. These were muzzle loaded Enfield {{infantry}} rifles unsuited for mounted use {{because they could}} not be loaded on horseback. Carpenter taught tactics that involved dismounted fighting, going back to the concept of [...] "mounted infantry" [...] who dismounted to fight.|$|R
50|$|In the meantime, {{a public}} {{debate over the}} merit of ABMs began. Difficulties that had already made an ABM system {{questionable}} for defending against an all-out attack. One <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> the Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS) that would give little warning to the defense. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> high altitude EMP (whether from offensive or defensive nuclear warheads) which could degrade defensive radar systems.|$|R
