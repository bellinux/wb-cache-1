40|$|Background: One {{perceived}} {{barrier to}} adherence to guidelines is {{the existence of}} patient preferences which may conflict with them. We examined whether patient preferences influence the prescription of antibiotics in general practice, and how this affects adherence to guidelines. We hypothesised that preferences play {{a greater role in}} prescribing antibiotics if the guideline allows for patient preferences to be taken into account, i. e. if prescribing antibiotics is an option which can be considered rather than a clear guideline recommendation to prescribe or not. We included three guidelines: acute cough, acute rhinosinusitis, and urinary tract infections. Methods: Data from the NIVEL Primary Care Database (NIVEL PCD) were used to assess antibiotic indications and prescriptions. These data were combined with a questionnaire among members of NIVEL’s Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel in order to examine patient preferences. According to the NIVEL PCD, 286 of these members contacted their GP in 2015 for acute cough, acute rhinosinusitis or urinary tract infections. A logistic multilevel regression analysis was performed to test our hypothesis. Results: Patient preferences do play a role in GPs’ prescribing of antibiotics but only in situations where in <b>accordance</b> <b>with</b> the guideline <b>their</b> use is an option which could be considered (interaction between indication and preference: p = 0. 049). If patients ask for antibiotics themselves in such situations, then GPs prescribe antibiotics more often. Conclusions: Patient preferences only play a role if the guideline provides room for these preferences to be taken into account. Therefore, our results do not suggest a conflict between applying guideline recommendations and including patient preferences. Further research is recommended to examine whether this conflict exists in other situations. Key messages: •Patient preferences do play a role in GPs’ prescribing of antibiotics but only in situations where in <b>accordance</b> <b>with</b> the guideline <b>their</b> use is an option which could be considered. •Our results do not suggest a conflict between applying guideline recommendations and including patient preferences.

A councilor from each of the city's eight council wards is elected to office every two years, each serving a term of two years. Councilors are elected from their own respective wards based on a plurality voting system; a councilor from each ward serves on the Norman City Council. A mayor is elected by the entire voting population of Norman and serves as an at-large councilor; the mayor serves for a term of three years. As a whole, the council acts as the legislative body of city government; it aims to pass laws, approve the city budget, and manage efficiency in the government. The City Council appoints a professional City Manager who is responsible for the day-to-day administrative activities of the city. The City of Norman has approximately 650 employees working in eleven departments and 31 boards and commissions that help oversee and implement the policies and services of the city. The City Council meets bi-weekly in City Hall located at 201 W. Gray Street in downtown Norman; various boards and commissions meet in <b>accordance</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> own schedules.

The Bay Area consists of four different areas: San Francisco, Oakland, Marin, and Silicon Valley, all of which have different characteristics and aesthetics. Players can navigate the game's world on-foot or by the various vehicles featured in the game, such as cars, trucks, buses, cable cars, motorcycles, quad bikes and boats. The driving mechanic was overhauled and designed to be more accessible. The players can shoot their weapons while driving. Marcus also has improved acrobatic skills, and the ability to parkour around the city. Players can use different methods to approach the game's missions, choosing between the aggressive approach, in which they defeat enemies with guns which are made with a 3D printer; explosives, like mines; or Marcus' own melee weapon, a billiard ball attached to a bungee cord. Alternatively, players can use the stealth approach, in which they can evade enemies or paralyze them temporarily with Marcus' taser. Players can also complete the game through hacking alone. When players commit too many crimes, the police officers will become alerted and will attempt to arrest the player.

5|$|Evidence from {{microelectrode}} recordings {{from the}} brains of animals shows that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra are strongly activated by {{a wide variety of}} rewarding events. These reward-responsive dopamine neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra are crucial for reward-related cognition and serve as the central component of the reward system.The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner....The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.}} The function of dopamine varies in each axonal projection from the VTA and substantia nigra; for example, the VTA–nucleus accumbens shell projection assigns incentive salience ("want") to rewarding stimuli and its associated cues, the VTA–orbitofrontal cortex projection updates the value of different goals in <b>accordance</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> incentive salience, the VTA–amygdala and VTA–hippocampus projections mediate the consolidation of reward-related memories, and both the VTA–nucleus accumbens core and substantia nigra–dorsal striatum pathways are involved in learning motor responses that facilitate the acquisition of rewarding stimuli. Some activity within the VTA dopaminergic projections appears to be associated with reward prediction as well.|$|E
