5|$|At {{their last}} session, Kaira admits to Jug {{that she has}} grown to like him. Jug {{responds}} that it is normal for <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> feel this way about his/her therapist and while he likes her too, she is still his patient and he, her psychologist, and a relationship would not be possible. The two share a hug before Kaira leaves.|$|E

5|$|In {{two small}} studies of two {{patients}} and another with one patient suffering from recurrent CSF leaks where repeated blood patches failed to form clots and relieve symptoms, the patients received temporary but complete resolution of symptoms with an epidural saline infusion. The saline infusion temporarily restores the volume necessary for <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> avoid SIH until the leak can be repaired properly. Intrathecal saline infusion {{is used in}} urgent cases such as intractable pain or decreased consciousness.|$|E

5|$|Bradykinesia (slowness of movement) {{is found}} in every case of PD, and is due to {{disturbances}} in motor planning of movement initiation, and associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation to execution of a movement. Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is impaired. Bradykinesia is the most handicapping symptom of Parkinson’s disease leading to difficulties with everyday tasks such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. It leads to particular difficulty in carrying out two independent motor activities {{at the same time}} and can be made worse by emotional stress or concurrent illnesses. Paradoxically patients with Parkinson's disease can often ride a bicycle or climb stairs more easily than walk on a level. While most physicians may readily notice bradykinesia, formal assessment requires <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> do repetitive movements with their fingers and feet.|$|E

25|$|The key pinch is {{a simple}} grasp in which the thumb applies force to an object to hold it against the lateral side of the index finger.

25|$|Some {{emergency}} {{departments in}} smaller hospitals are located near a helipad {{which is used}} by helicopters to transport <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> a trauma centre. This inter-hospital transfer is often done when a patient requires advanced medical care unavailable at the local facility. In such cases the emergency department can only stabilize the patient for transport.|$|E
25|$|Mishandling {{of contact}} lenses {{can also cause}} problems. Corneal {{abrasions}} can increase the chances of infection. When combined with improper cleaning and disinfection of the lens, a risk of infection further increases.

25|$|Chiropractic {{diagnosis}} {{may involve}} {{a range of}} methods including skeletal imaging, observational and tactile assessments, and orthopedic and neurological evaluation. A chiropractor may also refer <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> an appropriate specialist, or co-manage with another health care provider. Common patient management involves spinal manipulation (SM) and other manual therapies to the joints and soft tissues, rehabilitative exercises, health promotion, electrical modalities, complementary procedures, and lifestyle advice.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the profession has been a gradual move from simply transporting patients to hospital, to more advanced treatments in the field. In some countries, the paramedic may take on the role {{as part of a}} system to prevent hospital admission entirely and, through practitioners, are able to prescribe certain medications, or undertaking 'see and refer' visits, where the paramedic directly refers <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> specialist services without taking them to hospital.|$|E
25|$|ECT {{became popular}} in the US in the 1940s. At the time, {{psychiatric}} hospitals were overrun with patients whom doctors were desperate to treat and cure. Whereas lobotomies would reduce <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> a more manageable submissive state, ECT helped to improve mood in those with severe depression. A survey of psychiatric practice in the late 1980s found that an estimated 100,000 people received ECT annually, with wide variation between metropolitan statistical areas.|$|E

25|$|Critical care {{transporters}} move patients by ground ambulance or aircraft between {{medical treatment}} facilies. This may {{be done to}} allow <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> receive {{a higher level of}} care in a more specialized facility. Registered Nurses with training in Emergency Nursing may work with paramedics in these settings. Paramedics participating in this role generally also provide care not traditionally administered by Paramedics who respond to 911 calls. Examples of this are blood transfusions, intra-aortic balloon pumps, and mechanical ventilators.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{participants}} consisted of ex-patients of mental institutions who {{felt the need to}} challenge the system's treatment of the mentally ill. Initially, this movement targeted issues surrounding involuntary commitment, use of electroconvulsive therapy, anti-psychotic medication, and coercive psychiatry. Many of these advocacy groups were successful in the judiciary system. In 1975, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled in favour of the Mental Patient's Liberation Front of Rogers v. Okin, establishing the right of <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> refuse treatment.|$|E
