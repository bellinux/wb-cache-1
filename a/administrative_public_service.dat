The role of <b>administrative</b> identity of <b>public</b> <b>services</b> has been underresearched, empirical studies are lacking because various theoretical-methodological approaches exist. The research object is <b>administrative</b> identity of <b>public</b> <b>services.</b> The aim was to develop a theoretical framework for a consistent and analytical investigation into <b>administrative</b> identity of <b>public</b> <b>services</b> in real life. The term bureaucracy, civil service, civil servant refers to day-to-day administration of the state Streetlevel bureaucrats when implementing public policy have a certain degree of freedom/discretion in their work. Administrative discretion refers to their power to choose between the course of conduct while performing duties, thus, the street-level bureaucrat when making a decision or performing his duties may use his professional expertise and judgement instead of strictly adhering to regulations and statutes. Street-level bureaucracy as well as the factors that have influence on it have been under-researched. Literature on <b>public</b> <b>services</b> provides a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches to administrative identity and tends to rely on its simplified dichotomy therefore a new, clearly defined analytical construct is needed. For this purpose identity, grid/group cultural theories should be combined when analysing street-level bureaucracy. On the basis of these theories, administrative identity of street-level bureaucracy was developed, the concept of administrative identity was defined, its main elements were identified: a) responsibility and accountability b) customer orientation, c) compliance with rules or exercise of discretion. Each of them has different meanings in a fatalistic, hierarchical, individualistic and egalitarian worldview. Most contradictory and conflicting combinations of administrative identity were found by combining its elements. Those combinations allow to control identity and avoid undesired features...|$|R
