[...] Against a background of inter-service distrust, political issues, and the 1957 Defence White Paper, both types were rejected by the RAF; as being firmly subsonic, and incapable of meeting the RAF's range requirements; while the B.108, which retained Gyron Junior engines while being [...] heavier than the S.1, would have been severely underpowered, giving poor short-take off performance.

Additionally, the number of threat emitters on Cope Thunder ranges was doubled from 14 to 28 and several of the communication systems between ranges and Eielson have been upgraded.|$|E
5000|$|The Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) is an <b>all-weather</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{landing system}} based on {{real-time}} differential correction of the GPS signal. Local reference receivers located around the airport send data to a central location at the airport. This data is used to formulate a correction message, which is then transmitted to users via a VHF Data Link. A receiver on an aircraft uses this information to correct GPS signals, which then provides a standard ILS-style display to use while flying a precision approach. The FAA has stopped using the term LAAS and has transitioned to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) terminology of Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS). [...] While the FAA has indefinitely delayed plans for federal GBAS acquisition, the system can be purchased by airports and installed as a Non-Federal navigation aid.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of radomes and instruments that {{are sensitive to}} water films or ice formations in the nose section of <b>all-weather</b> <b>aircraft</b> and missiles necessitates {{a knowledge of the}} droplet impingement characteristics of bodies of revolution. Because it is possible to approximate many of these bodies with an ellipsoid of revolution, droplet trajectories about an ellipsoid of revolution with a fineness ratio of 10 were computed for incompressible axisymmetric air flow. From the computed droplet trajectories, the following impingement characteristics of the ellipsoid surface were obtained and are presented in terms of dimensionless parameters: (1) total rate of water impingement, (2) extent of droplet impingement zone, and (3) local rate of water impingement. These impingement characteristics are compared briefly with those previously reported for an ellipsoid of revolution with a fineness ratio of 5...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in aviation industry requires parallel effective plans, programs and designs of systems and facilities nationwide to fulfill the increasing needs for safe air transportation. Aircraft landing remains a problem {{for a long time}} all over the world. Systems that aircraft rely on in landing are unreliable to perform a precise guidance due to many limitations such as inaccuracy, unreliability and dependency. In low visibility conditions, when pilots are unable to see the runway, the aircrafts are diverted to another airport. However, low visibility can also affect all airports in the vicinity, forcing aircrafts to land in low visibility conditions depending on Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). Aircraft approach and landing are the most hazardous portions of flight; accidents records indicate that approximately 50 percent of the accidents occur during aircraft landing. Aircraft landing Category III C is not yet in operation anywhere in the world. It requires landing with no visibility or runway visual range. Currently, Global Positioning System (GPS) is the main navigation system used all over the world for aircraft navigation, approach and landing. However, in aircraft approach and landing phase, the accuracy of GPS is not sufficient to perform a perfect landing due to the possibility of aircraft to be drifted out of the runway. The accuracy of GPS could be improved to 3 meter by sending correction. Improved accuracy {{has not been able to}} meet ICAO standards for aircraft automatic landing. In this paper, aircraft landing systems characteristics, performance and accuracies have been studied and compared for the purpose of assessinglimitations and drawbacks. An aircraft landing system with improved performance is proposed to meet ICAO standards for <b>all-weather</b> <b>aircraft</b> landing required and recommended practices with high accuracy to perform full automatic landing for aircraft...|$|E
