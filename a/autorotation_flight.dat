40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to develop an autonomous autorotation landing system for an unmanned helicopter. Three-dimensional <b>autorotation</b> <b>flight</b> paths are obtained from a parametric optimization method (developed in previous work) to guide the aircraft through the three phases of a successful autorotation: entry, descent, and flare to landing at a desired location. In this study, the path planning algorithms are integrated with a flight control law and demonstrated in high fidelity simulations. Details of the autonomous autorotation trajectory following control law and analytical <b>autorotation</b> <b>flight</b> path implementation are presented. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of tracking complex three-dimensional autorotation trajectories from engine failure to safe touchdown at a pre-specified landing location...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAutorotation landing is {{a special}} {{manoeuvre}} for helicopter when the engine failed. In this situation, it requires the pilot's accurate management, correct judgment and decision on time to enter into steady autorotation. After entry into steady autorotation, then according to the flight altitude and speed, select the landing position, flare from autorotation, and perform a power-off landing successfully. Herein, it will be discussed how the helicopter performs the autorotation when losing the power, including the affecting factors. And refer to the airworthiness regulation, review the relevant sections, discuss the concerning aspect in the certification flight. Finally, it will through reviewing the <b>autorotation</b> <b>flight</b> compliance report of a helicopter, to understand those concerning aspects...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the Transient Simulation Method (TSM) which predicts the steady state {{and performance of}} <b>autorotation</b> in forward <b>flight.</b> Flapping and rotational equations of motion are integrated from an arbitrary initial rotor speed, and the steady state of autorotation is obtained as a periodic solution through a transient process. The induced velocity field update method and the average thrust, lift, and drag computations during the transition are described in detail. TSM is then applied to the model rotor to validate the feasibility. High speed autorotation is simulated using an aerodynamic data set that is analyzed by the two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes Solver. Rotor speed variation for increases in airspeed at low shaft angle is presented and discussed. When TSM is used with sophisticated aerodynamic data analyzed as functions of the blade angle of attack, the Reynolds number, and the Mach number, the autorotation range for the collective pitch, velocity, and shaft angle can be reasonably explored...|$|R

The design of prototypes inspired by autorotating plant seed geometries is presented along with a detailed experimental process that elucidates similarities between mechanical and robotic samara flight dynamics. The iterative development process and the implementation of working prototypes are discussed for robotic samara Micro-Air-Vehicles (MAV) that range in size from 7. 5 cm to 27 cm. Vehicle design issues are explored as they relate to <b>autorotation</b> efficiency, stability, <b>flight</b> dynamics and control of single winged rotorcraft. In recent years a new paradigm of highly maneuverable aircraft has emerged that are ideally suited for operation in a confined environment. Different from conven-tional aircraft, viscous forces play a large role in the physics of flight at this scale. This results in relatively poor aerodynamic performance of conventional airfoil and rotorcraft configurations.

Different from conven- tional aircraft, viscous forces play a large role in the physics of flight at this scale. This results in relatively poor aerodynamic performance of conventional airfoil and rotorcraft configurations. This deficiency has led to the consideration of naturally occurring geometries and configurations, the simplest of which is the samara. To study the influence of geometric variation on autorotation efficiency, a high speed camera system was used to track the flight path and orientation of the mechan- ical samaras. The wing geometry is planar symmetric and resembles a scaled version of Acer diabolicum Blume. The airfoil resembles a scaled version of the maple seed with a blunt leading edge followed by a thin section without camber. Four mechan- ical samara geometries with equal wing loading were designed and fabricated using a high precision rapid prototyping machine that ensured similarity between models. It was found that {{in order to reduce the}} descent velocity of an autorotating samara the area centroid or maximum chords should be as far from the center of rotation as possible. Flight data revealed large oscillations in feathering and coning angles, and the resultant flight path was found to be dependent on the mean feathering angle. The different flight modalities provided the basis for the design of a control sys- tem for a powered robotic samara that does not require high frequency sensing and actuation typical of micro-scaled rotorcraft. A prototype mechanical samara with a variable wing pitch (feathering) angle was constructed and it was found that active control of the feathering angle allowed the variation of the radius of the helix carved by the samara upon descent. This knowledge was used to design a hovering robotic samara capable of lateral motion through a series of different size circles specified by precise actuation of the feathering angle. To mathematically characterize the flight dynamics of the aircraft, System identi- fication techniques were used. Using flight data, a linear model describing the heave dynamics of two robotic samara vehicles was verified. A visual positioning system was used to collect flight data while the vehicles were piloted in an indoor laboratory. Closed-loop implementation of the derived PID controller was demonstrated using the visual tracking system for position and velocity feedback. An approach to directional control that does not require the once-per-revolution actuation or high-frequency measurement of vehicle orientation has been demon- strated for the first time. Lateral flight is attained through the vehicles differing responses to impulsive and step inputs that are leveraged to create a control strategy that provides full controllability. Flight testing revealed several linear relationships, including turn rate, turn radius and forward speed. The steady turn discussed here has been observed in scaled versions of the robotic samara, therefore the open-loop control demonstrated and analyzed is considered to be appropriate for similar vehicles of reduced size with limited sensing and actuation capabilities...|$|R
