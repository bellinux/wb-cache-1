5|$|Reviewers {{preferred}} the Nintendo64 port over the arcade release, and appreciated its <b>audiovisual</b> enhancements, but felt that its graphical upgrades and memorization-based combo gameplay were insufficient {{when compared to}} fighting games like Tekken 2 and Virtua Fighter 2. Critics recommended Gold primarily for fans of the series and genre, but IGN reported that even fans were upset by changes in the combo system {{and the absence of}} several well-liked characters. Gold ultimately did not replicate the success of its Super NES predecessor, and the series remained dormant through its 2002 acquisition by Microsoft until its 2013 reboot.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{building}} {{was designed by}} architect Daniel Libeskind and opened in July 2002, receiving 470,000 visitors {{in its first year}} of opening.

The museum features a permanent exhibition of chronological and thematic displays, supported by hourly <b>audiovisual</b> presentations which are projected throughout the gallery space. The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions in a separate gallery. Since opening, the museum has operated a successful volunteer programme, which since January 2007 has been run in partnership with Manchester Museum. As part of a national museum, Imperial War Museum North is financed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and by self-generated income. Admission is free.|$|E

5|$|The museum's {{first floor}} main gallery space houses the {{permanent}} exhibitions. These {{consist of a}} chronological display which runs around the gallery's 200m perimeter and six thematic displays in 'silos' within the space. The walls of the gallery space are used as screens for the projection of an hourly <b>audiovisual</b> presentation, the Big Picture. The main gallery, described as cavernous and dramatic, includes objects such as a Russian T-34 tank, a United States Marine Corps AV-8A Harrier jet, and a British 13-pounder field gun which fired the British Army's first shot of the First World War. The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions, mounted in a separate gallery.|$|E
5|$|Following a major {{expansion}} in 2003, {{a suite of}} rooms, used as accommodation by Churchill, his wife and close associates, {{was added to the}} museum. The restoration of these rooms, which since the war had been stripped out and used for storage, cost £7.5 million. In 2005 the War Rooms were rebranded as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, with 850 m2 of the site redeveloped as a biographical museum exploring Churchill's life. The museum, the development of which cost a further £6 million raised from private fundraising, makes extensive use of <b>audiovisual</b> technology. The centrepiece is a 15-metre interactive table that enables visitors to access digitised material, particularly from the Churchill Archives Centre, via an 'electronic filing cabinet'. The Churchill Museum won the 2006 Council of Europe Museum Prize. During 2009-2011 the museum received over 300,000 visitors a year. In May 2010 the name of the museum was shortened to Churchill War Rooms.|$|E

5|$|As {{far back}} as the Vitascope days, some exhibitors had {{screened}} films accompanied by phonographs playing appropriate, though very roughly timed, sound effects; {{in the style of the}} Kinetophone described above, rhythmically matching recordings were also made available for march and dance subjects. While Edison oversaw cursory sound-cinema experiments after the success of The Great Train Robbery (1903) and other Edison Manufacturing Company productions, it was not until 1908 that he returned in earnest to the combined <b>audiovisual</b> concept that had first led him to enter the motion picture field. Edison patented a synchronization system connecting a projector and a phonograph, located behind the screen, via an assembly of three rigid shafts—a vertical one descending from each device, joined by a third running horizontally the entire length of the theater, beneath the floor. Two years later, he supervised a press demonstration at the laboratory of a sound-film system of either this or a later design. In 1913, Edison finally introduced the new Kinetophone—like all of his sound-film exhibition systems since the first in the mid-1890s, it used a cylinder phonograph, now connected to a Projecting Kinetoscope via a fishing line–type belt and a series of metal pulleys. While it met with great acclaim in the short term, poorly trained operators had trouble keeping picture in synchronization with sound and, like other sound-film systems of the era, the Kinetophone had not solved the issues of insufficient amplification and unpleasant audio quality. Its drawing power as a novelty soon faded and when a fire at Edison's West Orange complex in December 1914 destroyed all of the company's Kinetophone image and sound masters, the system was abandoned.|$|E
