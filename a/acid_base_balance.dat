This uncommon fatty acid was subsequently used as substrate for sophorolipid fermentation with a Starmerella bombicola lactone esterase overexpression (oe sble) strain. A petroselinic <b>acid</b> <b>based</b> diacetylated sophorolipid lactone was obtained in high purity without incorporation of de novo synthesized fatty acids such as oleic acid.

40|$|To {{establish}} the overall frequency distribution and combination of acid-base and electrolyte disturbances as they {{occur in a}} general population requiring hospital care, we studied arterial blood gases and plasma electrolytes (sodium, potassium and chloride) in 110 consecutive patients (age = 68 +/- 8 SE; 64 M, 46 F) {{at the time of}} admission to a general medical ward. Disturbances were defined {{on the basis of the}} standard pH/pCO 2 plot and the normal (mean +/- 2 SD) electrolyte range for our laboratory. Sixty-two patients (56 %) showed a disturbance in <b>acid</b> <b>base</b> equilibrium: acidosis: respiratory 16, metabolic 6; alkalosis: respiratory 26, metabolic 10; in 4 / 62 the <b>acid</b> <b>base</b> disturbance was mixed. In 47 of the 62 patients, the <b>acid</b> <b>base</b> imbalance were associated with electrolyte derangements (low PNa+, 12; high PNa+, 1; low PK+, 10; high pK+, 7; increased anion gap, 17). Electrolyte disturbances with a normal <b>acid</b> <b>base</b> status were detected in only 2 patients. Of significance, in 7 of the 58 individuals considered to have a "pure" <b>acid</b> <b>base</b> disturbance on the basis of the pH/pCO 2 plot (5 respiratory alkalosis; 1 respiratory acidosis; 1 metabolic alkalosis), a widened anion gap revealed that the acid-base change was mixed, i. e. there was a concomitant component of metabolic acidosis.

The apparatus is an extracorporeal "ventriculo-cisternal circulation system" which is consisted of pressure pump, glass capillary electrode, Clark PO(2) eleotrode and Severinghaus Pco(2) electrode, all-lined up on a stainless steal conduit betweeen　lateral ventricle and cisterna magna. In the experimental cases of 5 dogs, the ventriculo-cisternal circulation system was used for monitoring acid base balanec of the CSF under acute intracranial hypertension produced by extradural balloon inflation. The blood Pco(2) was constantly watched during experiment {{to be kept in}} the normal range by means of a respirator. Pco(2) in the CSF began to increase in early stage above the pressure of CSF of 300 mmH(2) O and incseased more and more in parallel with raised pressure. HCO(3) - in the CSF was decreased when acute and more severe intracranial hypertension was maintained for hours. Hypercapnic acidosis and　metabolic acidosis occured in the CSF specifically when the intracranial pressure was raised acutely. Clinically, <b>acid</b> <b>base</b> <b>balance</b> of the CSF was studied on acute intracranial hypertension of three patients who suffered from brain tumor. Intracranial pressure was monitored continuously by pressure gauge transducer connected to the ventricular drainage. In this clinical research, CSF, arterial blood and jugular blood were sampled for measurement. Pco(2) in the CSF was increased　when the intracranial pressure was elevated above 500 mmH(2) O and metabolic　acidosis was added when the pressure was more elevated continued. That is to say, CSF　became acidosis as same as experimental results. On the contrary, arterial　blood became respiratory alkalosis when the intracranial pressure was elevated　to 500 - 1000 mmH(2) O. This phenomenon suggest that increse of hydrogenic ions induced by intracranial hypertension stimulates respiratory center.

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate clinically and under laboratory condition the sharp foreign body syndrome (SFBS) in buffaloes with special emphasis on the diagnostic value of radiography, ultrasonography and blood gases and acidbase balance. Materials and Methods: 196 buffaloes with a history of anorexia, reduction of milk production and no response to previous medical treatment were included in the present study. These animals were subjected to clinical and radiographical examinations. Positive cases for SFBS were further evaluated by sonography, hemato-biochemical and blood gas and <b>acid</b> <b>base</b> <b>balance</b> analysis. Results: Out of 196 admitted cases, 49 (25 %) cases were confirmed as SFBS by clinical and radiographical examination. Positive cases were subsequently divided into two main categories (complicated and non complicated) according to radiographical and sonographical findings. SFBS with no complication was diagnosed in 16 cases while 33 cases showed various degrees of complication including reticular adhesion (abdominal and diaphragmatic, n= 23), diaphragmatic hernia (n = 6) and traumatic pericarditis (n = 4). Leukocytosis, hyperprotenemia and increased activity of AST and ALT were of additional values in the diagnosis of SFBS. A consistent finding of primary metabolic alkalosis was recorded in all cases except one with advanced traumatic pericarditis that showed metabolic acidosis. Conclusion: While there is no substitution for clinical examination, using of ultrasonography and radiography simultaneously are essential for proper evaluation and differentiation between various sequelae of SFBS in buffaloes. Radiography is an efficient tool for visualization of metallic foreign body while ultrasonography is an excellent device in assessing fibrinous deposits.

40|$|Prevention of {{clotting}} is {{an important}} factor in continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to ensure that solute clearance, electrolytes and <b>acid</b> <b>base</b> and fluid <b>balance</b> are controlled. This article will focus attention on the components and design of the CRRT circuit, identifying strategies in the literature which may promote circuit life. It is important that the CRRT circuit incorporates biocompatible materials and is designed in a way which limits turbulent blood flow. Premature clotting is also more likely to occur when blood flow through the circuit is interrupted or sluggish as a result of poor vascular access, or when there is increased resistance or obstruction in the circuit. The pre-dilution method of fluid replacement reduces blood viscosity inside the haemofilter and assists in delaying the onset of blood clots by limiting the potential for haemoconcentration. The monitoring and adjustment of the blood level inside the venous bubble or air trap can lessen the effect of blood-air contact and protect the site from excessive clotting. A number of other factors are also considered important as predictors of circuit life in the operation and management of the circuit. They include the choice of access site and design configuration of the catheter device, and the level of competency of nursing staff preparing and monitoring circuit function. Whilst the value of intermittent saline flushing has not been proven to be of benefit in promoting circuit life, it remains to be determined whether the choice in the CRRT mode affects circuit life differently. In conclusion, specific measures in the application of CRRT besides anticoagulation therapy can influence the development of blood clots and the duration of circuit life. This requires the development of evidence-based practice guidelines which include strategies that are known to promote circuit life...|$|R
