5|$|Several {{problems}} were experienced with the iPhone 5S's hardware after its release. The most widely reported {{issue is that}} the angle reported by the phone's level sensor had drifted by several degrees, which caused the gyroscope, compass, and <b>accelerometer</b> to become inaccurate. Reports suggested {{that this is a}} hardware-induced problem. Some encountered other problems such as crashing with a blue screen and then restarting, the power button making a rattling noise when the phone was shaken, overheating, the microphone not working, and Touch ID not working for iTunes purchases. Some of these issues have been fixed by software updates.|$|E
5|$|Some active subwoofers use a servo {{feedback}} mechanism {{based on}} cone movement which modifies the signal {{sent to the}} voice coil. The servo feedback signal is derived from {{a comparison of the}} input signal to the amplifier versus the actual motion of the cone. The usual source of the feedback signal is a few turns of voice coil attached to the cone or a microchip-based <b>accelerometer</b> placed on the cone itself. An advantage of a well-implemented servo subwoofer design is reduced distortion making smaller enclosure sizes possible. The primary disadvantages are cost and complexity.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera {{in front of the}} plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, <b>accelerometer,</b> variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|E

50|$|<b>Accelerometers</b> have {{multiple}} applications in industry and science. Highly sensitive <b>accelerometers</b> are components of {{inertial navigation systems}} for aircraft and missiles. <b>Accelerometers</b> are used to detect and monitor vibration in rotating machinery. <b>Accelerometers</b> are used in tablet computers and digital cameras so that images on screens are always displayed upright. <b>Accelerometers</b> are used in drones for flight stabilisation. Coordinated <b>accelerometers</b> {{can be used to}} measure differences in proper acceleration, particularly gravity, over their separation in space; i.e., gradient of the gravitational field. This gravity gradiometry is useful because absolute gravity is a weak effect and depends on local density of the Earth which is quite variable.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{points out}} the {{performance}} and limits of commercial resistive, piezoresistive, piezoelectric, capacitive, thermal and optical <b>accelerometers</b> {{and can be used}} as a reference work. Therefore, datasheets of 118 <b>accelerometers</b> from 27 manufacturers of eight countries have been analyzed. Focus of the analysis were the parameters overload shock limit, measurement range, frequency response, resonance frequency, volume, weight, power consumption and operating temperature of both uniaxial and triaxial <b>accelerometers.</b> <b>Accelerometers</b> with overload shock limits in the range of 50 g to 200 x 103 g and within a measurement range of 2 g to 110 x 103 g have been analyzed. The unit g stands for the gravity acceleration defined as 9. 81 meters per square second. A strict overload shock limit of 10 x 103 g for <b>accelerometers</b> with proof mass and a measurement range of less than 2 x 103 g was found. Also, that the performance of uniaxial and triaxial <b>accelerometers</b> differs. Especially uniaxial piezoelectric <b>accelerometers</b> show a better performance with regard to overload shock, measurement range, resonance frequency, frequency response and operating temperature in contrast to triaxial ones. Piezoelectric <b>accelerometers</b> show the highest overload shock limits, measurement range and operating temperature, capacitive <b>accelerometers</b> the lowest power consumption and volume, piezoresistive <b>accelerometers</b> the widest frequency response...|$|R

25|$|The iPhone 4 {{introduces}} a gyroscopic sensor that detects 3-axis angular acceleration around the X, Y and Z axes, enabling precise calculation of yaw, pitch, and roll. The gyroscope complements the <b>accelerometer,</b> a sensor {{that has been}} present since the original iPhone, which detects the device's acceleration, shake, vibration shock, or fall by detecting linear acceleration along one of three axes (X, Y and Z). The combined data from the <b>accelerometer</b> and the gyroscope provides detailed and precise information about the device's 6-axis movement in space. The 3 axes of the gyroscope combined with the 3 axes of the <b>accelerometer</b> enable the device to recognize approximately how far, fast, and in which direction it has moved in space.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{design and}} {{implementation}} of instrumentation to collect real-time vibrational data from a quasi-steady state machine (a dry vacuum pump) for fault prediction diagnostics is presented. When simultaneous multiple data collection points are required on the same machinery, the use of conventional transducers such as piezoelectric <b>accelerometers</b> becomes impractical due to their price, as each needs an expensive associated charge amplifier. The use of inexpensive micromachined integrated micro-electrical-mechanical system <b>accelerometers</b> such as ADXL 105 has been explored here {{as an alternative to}} piezoelectric <b>accelerometers</b> for obtaining reliable and predictable data for diagnostics. Surface micromachined <b>accelerometers</b> are a new technology and their usage for vibrational analysis has been conservative due to concerns over increased noise levels and tolerance to high temperatures. In this article, it is shown that such concerns can be allayed. The time and frequency domain vibration signatures obtained using both types of <b>accelerometers</b> are compared. The study shows that ADXL 105 <b>accelerometers</b> can be an effective alternative low-cost high-quality solution for machine condition monitoring...|$|R

25|$|The Wii Remote uses two AA {{batteries}} {{as a power}} source, {{which can}} power a Wii Remote for 60 hours using only the <b>accelerometer</b> functionality and 25 hours using both <b>accelerometer</b> and pointer functionality. In May 2013, Nintendo announced a rechargeable battery and dock accessory, and various third-party manufacturers market charging solutions for the controller (see Wii Remote Chargers). According to an interview with Nintendo industrial designer Lance Barr, limitations of the Wii Remote's expansion port make it unlikely {{that it will be}} used for internal battery charging. Although Nintendo discourages other rechargeable battery types such as lithium ion (Li-ion) and nickel-cadmium (NiCd), the company's support website indicates that nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries may be used. A 3300µF capacitor provides a temporary source of power during quick movements of the Wii Remote when connection to the batteries may be temporarily interrupted. If the Wii Remote is not used for more than 5 minutes, such as when the player is using a GameCube controller or watching Netflix, it will shut off, and can be re-activated by pressing any button.|$|E
