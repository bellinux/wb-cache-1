5|$|As his {{four-year}} term as executive neared its end, Agnew {{knew that his}} chances of re-election were slim, given that the county's Democrats had healed their rift. Instead, in 1966 he sought the Republican nomination for governor, and {{with the backing of}} party leaders won the April primary by <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>margin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Besides taxation, William's large landholdings {{throughout}} England strengthened his rule. As King Edward's heir, he controlled all of {{the former}} royal lands. He also retained control {{of much of the}} lands of Harold and his family, which made the king the largest secular landowner in England by <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>margin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sanders won 78.0% of {{the vote}} statewide; only {{his home state of}} Vermont, Alaska, and Utah have given him <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>margin</b> of victory.|$|R

In the 2006 election among Jackson's opponents was Libertarian Party candidate and African-American pastor Anthony Williams, an outspoken opponent of immigration. Jackson won with 85% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|The Panthers' all-time goaltender {{records are}} {{primarily}} held by two players. Roberto Luongo holds the franchise regular-season records for games played, wins, losses, ties, and shutouts. As {{a result of}} being the starting goaltender for the 1996 Stanley Cup run and the 1997 playoffs, John Vanbiesbrouck holds all of the Panthers playoff records, most by <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>margin.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Carroll {{was elected}} to the Kentucky Senate from District 7, {{defeating}} Harold Fletcher – the older brother of then-governor Ernie Fletcher – by <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>margin.</b> The district included all or portions of Anderson, Fayette, Franklin, and Woodford counties. He made headlines in 2007 when he called on Fletcher's lieutenant governor, Steve Pence, to resign for his disloyalty after Pence endorsed Anne Northup in the Republican gubernatorial primary rather than backing Fletcher's re-election bid. Pence refused to resign, citing an investigation of the administration's hiring practices as his reason for refusing to endorse Fletcher. Fletcher won the Republican primary, but lost in the general election to Democrat Steve Beshear.|$|E
50|$|Herseth again prevailed, {{this time}} by <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>margin</b> of 53% to 46% despite President George W. Bush's {{dominant}} 59.9% to 38.4% over Senator John Kerry in South Dakota in the 2004 presidential election.|$|R

25|$|As well, Monique Smith {{retained}} Nipissing by just 377 votes over Progressive Conservative candidate Bill Vrebosch — in 2003, she had defeated Progressive Conservative incumbent Al McDonald by <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>margin</b> of over 3,000 votes.|$|R
5|$|In November 2011, the {{government}} laid {{a plan to}} cut utilities subsidies to higher income households. By mid-2011, credit was outpacing GDP by <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>margin,</b> raising concerns that the economy was overheating. Argentina began a period of fiscal austerity in 2012. In April 2012, {{the government}} announced plans to expropriate YPF, despite the opposition of some energy experts, claiming that YPF's Spanish partner and major holder, Repsol, had not done his duty as to provide the financial support for research and land exploitation, {{as well as being}} a bad administrator concerned only in sending profits to Spain and forsaking YPF's economic growth.|$|E
5|$|On November 17, 2007 in Judah {{defeated}} Ryan Davis by unanimous decision. With the win, he won {{the vacant}} IBC light middleweight title. The fight {{took place at the}} Casablanca Casino in Providenciales, Turks And Caicos Islands which had an open roof. In the third round it began to rain. Since there was no marquee covering the ring, both fighters continued to fight in the rain. During the third, Judah scored a knockdown on Davis, although he recovered, he went on to lose by <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>margin</b> (119-109 119-109 118-110).|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{finished}} his career after carrying 1,941 times for 8,597yards and 83 touchdowns. He {{was the first}} player to record five straight seasons of at least 1,000 rushing yards. His 81 rushing touchdowns for the Packers remains a franchise record by <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>margin,</b> and his 8,207 rushing yards with the team has been surpassed only once. Taylor was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1976. He {{is a member of the}} Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame and his number 31 jersey is retired by the Saints.|$|E
50|$|In the 2000 federal election, however, Comartin {{defeated}} Limoges for {{the seat}} {{by a margin of}} 401 votes. Limoges ran again in the 2004 election, and was defeated by <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>margin</b> of 3,818 votes.|$|R
50|$|At the 2004 Puerto Rican general elections, Arlequín {{retained}} the seat winning by <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>margin</b> this time (57.7% of the votes). His main rival was again Pacheco Giudicelli, who received only 39.3% of the votes.|$|R
50|$|The Liberals were {{defeated}} provincially in the 1958 election, although Guttormson won his own seat by <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>margin</b> than before. He was also re-elected without difficulty {{in the elections}} of 1959, 1962 and 1966. Guttormson also served as party whip.|$|R
5|$|The {{elections}} were held on May 14, 1989. Menem won by <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>margin,</b> {{and became the}} new president. He was scheduled to take office on December 10, but inflation levels took {{a turn for the}} worse, growing into hyperinflation, causing public riots. The outgoing president Alfonsín resigned and transferred power to Menem five months early, on July 8. Menem's accession marked the first time since Hipólito Yrigoyen took office in 1916 that an incumbent government was peacefully succeeded by a president from an opposition party.|$|E
5|$|Wendell Lewis Willkie (born Lewis Wendell Willkie; February 18, 1892 – October 8, 1944) was an American {{lawyer and}} {{corporate}} executive, and the 1940 Republican nominee for President. Willkie appealed to many convention delegates as the Republican field's only interventionist: although the U.S. remained neutral prior to Pearl Harbor, he favored greater U.S. involvement in World War II to support Britain and other Allies. His Democratic opponent, incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt, won the 1940 election with about 55% {{of the popular}} vote and took the electoral college vote by <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>margin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both Democrats and Republicans were {{concerned}} about the presence of S. Brewer Erwin, nominee of the newly formed Populist Party, in the race; he enjoyed strong support for a third-party candidate, despite the fact that many believed his party's platform was too radical. Democrats, who were used to carrying the agrarian vote by <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>margin,</b> were especially concerned that the Farmers' Alliance, consisting of over 125,000 members in Kentucky, would endorse Erwin. This did not occur, however, and in the general election, Brown defeated Wood by a vote of 144,168 to 116,087. Though he won the election, Brown had not won a majority of the votes; Populist Erwin captured 25,631 votes – 9 percent of the total cast – and a Prohibition candidate received 3,292 votes.|$|E

50|$|Foster {{held the}} Lancaster seat until his defeat at the 1900 general {{election}} by the narrow margin of 44 votes (0.4% of the total). He stood again in 1906, but was defeated again, {{this time by}} <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>margin</b> of 884 votes (7.2%).|$|R

5|$|Harper {{ran for the}} Canadian House of Commons in the 1988 federal election, {{appearing}} on the ballot as Steve Harper in Calgary West and losing by <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>margin</b> to Hawkes, his former employer. After Reform candidate Deborah Grey was elected as the party's first MP in a 1989 by-election, Harper became Grey's executive assistant, and was her chief adviser and speechwriter until 1993. He remained prominent in the Reform Party's national organization {{in his role as}} policy chief, encouraging the party to expand beyond its Western base, and arguing that strictly regional parties were at risk of being taken over by radical elements. He delivered a speech at the Reform Party's 1991 national convention, in which he condemned extremist views.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} contest of the {{primaries}} season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders, making {{her the first}} woman to win the Iowa caucuses. In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>margin.</b> Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20, but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers. Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27. These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.|$|E
5|$|The {{governing}} African National Congress (ANC), {{supported by}} its Tripartite Alliance with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Communist Party (SACP), have held {{a majority of}} the seats in the National Assembly since 1994. They were re-elected with increasing majorities in 1999 and 2004, and with a slight fall in its majority from 69% to 65.9% in 2009. The ANC is led by Jacob Zuma. In 2012, Zuma was re-elected to a second five-year term as President of the African National Congress, beating his only rival and deputy, Kgalema Motlanthe, by <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>margin.</b> Cyril Ramaphosa was elected as Deputy President of the ANC, succeeding Motlanthe who had declined a second term after losing to Zuma.|$|E
50|$|She {{was elected}} to the Senate of Virginia (a {{part-time}} position) as a Republican in 2007, after long-term state senator Russ Potts retired, defeating several opponents in the Republican primary and the general election.

50|$|In 1970, when Wyoming's House seat became open again, Roncalio ran {{again for}} his old job, winning by just 608 votes. He was re-elected {{narrowly}} in 1972, but by <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>margin</b> in 1974, when he defeated Thomas F. Stroock, {{and again in}} 1976.|$|R
50|$|Korzeniowski {{was elected}} to the Manitoba {{legislature}} in the 1999 provincial election as a New Democrat in the west Winnipeg riding of St. James, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Gerry McAlpine by 4483 votes to 3845.

5|$|The {{number of}} trees in the world, {{according}} to a 2015 estimate, is 3.04 trillion, of which 1.39 trillion (46%) are in the tropics or sub-tropics, 0.61 trillion (20%) in the temperate zones, and 0.74 trillion (24%) in the coniferous boreal forests. The estimate is about eight times higher than previous estimates, {{and is based on}} tree densities measured on over 400,000 plots. It remains subject to <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>margin</b> of error, not least because the samples are mainly from Europe and North America. The estimate suggests that about 15 billion trees are cut down annually and about 5 billion are planted. In the 12,000 years since the start of human agriculture, the number of trees worldwide has decreased by 46%.|$|E
5|$|With Kirchner leading all the pre-election polls by <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>margin,</b> her challengers {{focused on}} forcing {{her into a}} ballotage. To win in a single round, a presidential {{candidate}} in Argentina needs either more than 45% of the vote, or 40% of the vote and a lead of more than 10 percentage points over the runner-up. However, with 13 challengers splitting the vote, Kirchner won the election decisively {{in the first round}} with just over 45% of the vote, followed by 23% for Elisa Carrió (candidate for the Civic Coalition) and 17% for former Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna. Kirchner was popular among the suburban working class and the rural poor, while Carrió and Lavagna both received more support from the urban middle class. Kirchner lost the election in the large cities of Buenos Aires and Rosario.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{has been}} {{described}} as entertaining, controversial, and politically incorrect. He supported Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries and questioned Barack Obama's appeal to white voters. Ford later apologized for his comments, stating that any Democrat could win and that he had supported other African American candidates for president in the past. Ford's comments prompted a primary challenge in 2008 from Charleston lawyer Dwayne Green. In the beginning of his campaign, Green managed to raise double the amount of campaign funds Ford raised, and although Ford's fundraising improved he for the first time attended a candidate forum to receive free publicity, because his campaign had financial difficulty resulting from the contested primary and a fire in his home. Green was defeated in the primary election by <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>margin.</b> Ford praised Obama's election in November 2008, but criticized South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn's family for allegedly attempting to profit off Obama's victory.|$|E
50|$|He was re-elected by <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>margin</b> in the 1999 election, and {{received}} over 73% {{support in the}} 2003 election. Jennissen was the NDP critic for Highways and Transportation between 1995 and 1999, but was not appointed to cabinet when the NDP formed government in 1999.|$|R
50|$|Wasylycia-Leis was re-elected in 1988, {{although}} by {{a narrower}} margin; she defeated Liberal Ruth Oberman, 3,092 votes to 2,480. In the 1990 provincial election, she was re-elected again by <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>margin,</b> defeating Mark Minenko, the incumbent from Seven Oaks, which was eliminated due to redistribution.|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{cirrhosis}} {{were found}} to be extremely sensitive to tranylcypromine, and the use of this drug for the treatment of depression in such patients is contraindicated. Amitriptyline has <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>margin</b> of safety in such patients, but caution is necessary when the higher therapeutic doses are prescribed...|$|R
