Microsensor measurements (O 2, NO 2 −, NO 3 −, and H 2 S) were performed on single sludge flocs to detect anoxic niches, nitrate reduction, or sulfate reduction on a microscale. Incubations of activated sludge with 15 NO 3 − and 35 SO 42 − {{were used to determine}} denitrification and sulfate reduction rates on a batch scale. In four of six investigated sludges, no <b>anoxic</b> <b>zones</b> developed during aeration, and consequently denitrification rates were very low. However, in two sludges anoxia in flocs coincided with significant denitrification rates. Sulfate reduction could not be detected in any sludge in either the microsensor or the batch investigation, not even under short-term anoxic conditions. In contrast, the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria was shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization with 16 S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes and by PCR-based detection of genes coding for the dissimilatory sulfite reductase. A possible explanation for the absence of anoxia even in most of the larger flocs might be that oxygen transport is not only diffusional but enhanced by advection, i. e., facilitated by flow through pores and channels. This possibility is suggested by the irregularity of some oxygen profiles and by confocal laser scanning microscopy of the three-dimensional floc structures, which showed that flocs from the two sludges in which <b>anoxic</b> <b>zones</b> were found were apparently denser than flocs from the other sludges...|$|R

The plant performed well {{for the removal of}} carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the process of treating domestic wastewater within a temperature range of 10. 8 degrees C to 30. 5 degrees C. Mass balance calculations indicated that COD utilization mainly occurred in the anoxic phase, accounting for 88. 2 % of total COD removal. Ammonia nitrogen removal occurred 13. 71 % in the <b>anoxic</b> <b>zones</b> and 78. 77 % in the aerobic zones. The contribution of <b>anoxic</b> <b>zones</b> to total nitrogen (TN) removal was 57. 41 %. Results indicated that nitrogen elimination in the oxic tanks was mainly contributed by simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND). The reduction of phosphorus mainly took place in the oxic zones, 61. 46 % of the total removal. Denitrifying phosphorus removal was achieved biologically by 11. 29 %. Practical experience proved that adaptability to gradually changing temperature of the microbial populations was important to maintain the plant overall stability. Sudden changes in temperature did not cause paralysis of the system just lower removal efficiency, which could be explained by functional redundancy of microorganisms that may compensate the adverse effects of temperature changes to a certain degree.

Bacterial bio-electrochemical systems that facilitate {{electron transfer}} via conductive filaments or across man-made electrodes are well-known, but {{the impact of}} abiotic currents across naturally occurring conductive and semiconductive minerals is poorly understood. In this paper I use cyclic voltammetry to explore electron transfer between electrodes made of common iron minerals (magnetite, hematite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, mackinawite, and greigite), and hydroquinones—a class of organic molecules found in carbon-rich sediments. Of all tested minerals, only pyrite and magnetite showed an increase in electric current {{in the presence of}} organic molecules, with pyrite showing excellent electrocatalytic performance. Pyrite electrodes performed better than commercially available glassy carbon electrodes and showed higher peak currents, lower overpotential values and a smaller separation between oxidation and reduction peaks for each tested quinone. Hydroquinone oxidation on pyrite surfaces was reversible, diffusion controlled, and stable over a large number of potential cycles. Given the ubiquity of both pyrite and quinones, abiotic electron transfer between minerals and organic molecules is likely widespread in Nature and may contribute to several different phenomena, including anaerobic respiration {{of a wide variety of}} microorganisms in temporally <b>anoxic</b> <b>zones</b> or in the proximity of hydrothermal vent chimneys, as well as quinone cycling and the propagation of <b>anoxic</b> <b>zones</b> in organic rich waters. Finally, interactions between pyrite and quinones make use of electrochemical gradients that have been suggested as an important source of energy for the origins of life on Earth.
