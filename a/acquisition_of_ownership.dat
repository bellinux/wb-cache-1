5000|$|In stark {{contrast}} to the Converse Rubber case is the ruling in Emerald Garment Manufacturing Corp. v. Court of Appeals. The trademarks in opposition are Emerald Garment’s “Stylistic Mr. Lee” and respondent’s “LEE”. The Director of Patents denied petitioner’s application for registration due to confusing similarity as determined by the test of dominancy. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the Director of Patents not only on the ground of confusing similarity among the dominant features, but also on the ground of prior use by respondent. The Supreme Court decided the case using the holistic test, “taking into account the factual circumstances”, and thereby concluded that there is no confusing similarity between the marks. First, since the products involved are jeans which are not “your ordinary inexpensive household item like catsup”, buyers are “predisposed to be more cautious and discriminatory”. Second, jeans are bought by brand, and its buyers are not merely the ordinary purchaser but the “intelligent buyer”. Such buyers are presumed to less likely be confused or deceived. Also, private respondent failed to establish prior actual commercial use of its ‘LEE’ trademark in the Philippines. Prior actual use is essential for the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> over a trademark pursuant to R.A. 166.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} {{evidence on the}} economic relevance of property rights however, only recently economists have begun to study their determinants {{by looking at the}} trade-off between the dispersed coercive power in a state of anarchy and the predation by a central authority. To illustrate, incomplete property rights allow agents with valuation lower than that of the original owners of economic value to inefficiently expropriate them distorting in this way their investment and effort exertion decisions. When instead, the state is entrusted the power to protect property, it might directly expropriate private parties if not sufficiently constrained by an efficient political process. The necessity of strong protection of property for efficiency has been however criticized by a vast legal scholarship, originated from the seminal contribution by Guido Calabresi and Douglas Melamed. These authors argue that in the face of transaction costs sufficiently sizeable to prevent consensual trade, legalized private expropriation in the form of, for instance, liability rules can be welfare-increasing. Carmine Guerriero blends these two different strands of literature by linking property rights protection, transaction costs, and preference heterogeneity. To elaborate, when property is fully protected, some agents with valuation higher than that of the original owners will be unable to legally acquire value because of sizable transaction costs. When the protection of property is weak instead, low-valuation potential buyers inefficiently expropriate original owners. Hence, a rise in the heterogeneity of the potential buyers' valuations makes inefficient expropriation by low-valuation potential buyers be more important from a social welfare point of view than inefficient exclusion from trade and so induces stronger property rights. Crucially, this prediction survives even after considering production and investment activities and it is consistent with a novel dataset on the rules on the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> through adverse possession and on the use of government takings to transfer real property from a private party to another private party prevailing in 126 jurisdictions. These data measure “horizontal property rights” and thus the extent of protection of property from “direct and indirect private takings,” which are ubiquitous forms of expropriation that occur daily within {{the rule of law and}} are thus different from predation by the state and the elites, which is much less common but has been the focus of the economics literature. To capture preference diversity, the author uses the contemporary genetic diversity, which is a primitive metric of the genealogical distance between populations with a common ancestor and so of the differences in characteristics transmitted across generations, such as preferences. Regression analysis reveals that the protection of the original owners' property rights is the strongest where contemporary genetic diversity is the largest. Evidence from several different identification strategies suggests that this relationship is indeed causal.|$|E
40|$|Contractual <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> of movable things: {{comparison}} of Czech and German legal regulation The {{aim of this}} thesis is to introduce and compare three main approaches towards <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> of movable things, which are currently present on the European continent. For this purpose, three different civil codes are outlined, whereas each of them represents one possible approach. The question, which of these systems works the best, has already been thoroughly discussed at the European level. However, the Czech civil code of 2012 {{has decided not to}} follow the conclusion of these discussions and opted for a different approach. Since the Czech lawmaker does not provide a duly reasoned explanation as to why he has decided to adopt a different rule, this thesis aims {{to take a closer look}} at the reasons, which might have played a decisive role. The topic of this thesis is divided into the four parts. Chapter one is introductory and its purpose is especially to set out the essential terminology such as thing, ownership or acquisition thereof. Chapter two outlines the respective approaches towards <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> of movable things.

40|$|In {{this note}} the {{question}} as to the effect of a divorce order upon the ownership of the assets of a marriage in community of property is answered with reference to recent case law. The discussion begins with an overview of the general principles applicable in South African law to the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership.</b> In the case of derivative <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> our law requires inter alia traditio, and without it ownership cannot be acquired. However, in a recent decision the court held {{that in the case of}} a divorce settlement in a marriage in community of property, with the grant of the divorce order the former spouses automatically acquire individual ownership of assets as agreed upon in the divorce settlement. The note looks critically at the reasons for this judgment and reaches the conclusion that the decision is wrong. This view is also shared by a subsequent judgement where the court decided that the settlement agreement creates only a personal right, or personal rights, for the transfer of ownership and that the divorce order consequently does not vest ownership without traditio. This decision, after critical revision, is supported. [URL]...|$|E

In the introduction, the paper {{deals with the}} {{theories}} of residential property {{and the ways in}} which the ownership of apartments is understood in selected international treatments. The main part of the paper focuses on the different methods to acquire ownership rights on a residential unit, both in the original way, i. e. acquiring ownership on after construction, and in the derivative way, mainly on the basis of contractual relations. The next part of the thesis deals with the interpretation of cooperative apartments, including their origin and development in a historical context, focusing on the problematic of the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> rights to cooperative apartments. The practical part includes an interpretation of <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> of an apartment by the shareholders of a legal entity established for the purpose of acquiring apartment buildings and renting the apartments to the shareholders, even though it is not a housing cooperative.

40|$|It is an {{accepted}} principle in South African law that movable property acquired in an original way (by operation of law) is not burdened by any limited real rights, as previous limited real rights are extinguished on the vesting of ownership (mobilia non habent sequelam). It is assumed by some South African writers {{that the same}} principles are applicable to the original {{acquisition of immovable property}} and that all existing limited real rights fall away on original <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership.</b> In this article the nature of limited real rights to immovable property is examined, and the notion that ownership is the "mother" right on which all limited real rights are based is scrutinised critically. The nature and establishment of limited real rights are used to distinguish between the essence and effect of limited real rights in the case of immovable property. The recognition of limited real rights as constitutional property is used as a further argument that limited real rights cannot be extinguished automatically by the original acquisition of immovable property, as such common law or statutory measures will constitute an arbitrary deprivation of property in terms of section 25 of the Constitution. The statutory provisions regarding limited real rights in the case of prescription and expropriation are then analysed as an indication {{that it is not a}} general principle that limited real rights are extinguished automatically on the original <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> of immovable property...|$|E

40|$|It is less {{known that}} since the Severan Dynasty the {{creditor}} {{had the opportunity to}} ask the emperor for permanent ownership over the pledged thing (impetratio dominii). It is known, however, that the protection of the debtor's interests, given that it was easier to collect taxes from them than from large land-owners, was of utmost importance for imperial finances. Therefore, apart from prohibiting the stipulation of lex commissoria, as well as conditioning pactum Marcianum with just price of the pledged thing, the rights of the debtor were protected by subjecting impetratio dominii to several conditions. Imperatio dominii depended on a publicly announced previous attempt of sale as well as on its annulment in case the creditor continues to collect interest after the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> over the pledged thing. Unsatisfied with the lack of application of these conditions in practice, Justinian posted additional conditions for the application of this institute in 530 : the obligation to attempt to sell the pledged thing within two years; to inform the debtor about it even after the expiration of this deadline, in order to give him the opportunity to pay his debt; to seek special approval of the emperor for the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> after the expiration of these deadlines; by introducing a subsequent possibility for the debtor to repurchase the pledge from the creditor within two years; making irreversible the creditor's ownership over the pledged thing only after the expiration of approximately four years; fair assessment of value of the pledged thing with the obligation of the creditor to return the surplus to the debtor as well as his right to request the payment of the outstanding amount from the debtor.
