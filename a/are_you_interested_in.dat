He sometimes collaborated with Larry Hama. In Comics Interview #37 (1986), Hama recalled working with Reese and Wood: I guess in 1971 or thereabouts, I was living in Brooklyn and working with Ralph Reese, freelance stuff. I was penciling, and he was inking. We were doing a lot of jobs for National Lampoon. At the time, Woody was moving to Brooklyn, six to eight blocks from where I lived.

5000|$|In a 2009 interview, Falzarano said, [...] "I didn’t {{start out}} {{thinking}} that I {{was going to}} do a 'special guest' album or an 'and friends' album. Whenever friends of mine or people I knew were coming to town, I'd say, 'Hey, I'm in the middle of working on an album. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> doing a session?' The reason it sounds cohesive — even though it took so long to come together — is because when I do my stuff or I do my thing, it's me. It's what I sound like. Regardless of whether it takes me ten years or two weeks, it usually winds up sounding pretty much the same. For the most part, I play traditional-sounding roots music, Americana kind of stuff. So, it's not fashionable in the sense that if I don't get this out this year, it's going to be old-hat." ...|$|E
