5|$|Numerous tornadoes {{touched down}} across Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, {{and several other}} states. Most of the tornadoes were weak, but a few caused {{considerable}} damage. A long-tracked wedge tornado caused EF2 damage along <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>through</b> rural portions of Texas and Louisiana. An EF3 tornado destroyed multiple structures and caused severe damage at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, as well. A total of 55 tornadoes were confirmed the 26th, though no fatalities occurred.|$|E

5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>through</b> a maze-like route from a starting point, represented as a circle, to a goal point, represented as a line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete the maze but to find the right path that completes the puzzle correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to find the right starting point that can complete the maze, or they may {{have to figure out how}} to reach a specific end point to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a symbolic language that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in the spaces between traceable paths require the player to find <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>through</b> the maze that separates these squares by color. Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve the puzzle, such as studying a nearby tree with branches that mimic the puzzle, or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section that are designed to help the player identify and understand the mechanic and meaning of the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent symbolic language.|$|E
5|$|By 23:30 on her own, Moltke {{encountered}} four British dreadnoughts, {{from the}} rear division of the 2nd Battle Squadron. Moltkes commander Kapitän von Karpf ordered the ship to swing away, hoping {{he had not been}} detected. The British ships in fact had seen Moltke, but had decided to not open fire in order to not reveal their location to the entire German fleet. At 23:55, and again at 00:20, Kapitän von Karpf tried to find <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>through</b> the British fleet, but both times was unable to do so. It was not until 01:00, after having steamed far ahead of the Grand Fleet, that Moltke was able to make good her escape.|$|E
5|$|Endeavour then resumed her voyage westward {{along the}} coast, picking <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>through</b> {{intermittent}} shoals and reefs {{with the help}} of the pinnace, which was rowed ahead to test the water depth. By 26 August she was out of sight of land, and had entered the open waters of the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, earlier navigated by Luis Váez de Torres in 1606. To keep Endeavours voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and ordered them to remain silent about where they had been.|$|E

5|$|On 29 August 1942, {{during the}} Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury {{was one of}} the few {{survivors}} of a platoon that had been overrun by the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counter-attack. Rushing forward and firing his Bren gun from the hip, he cleared <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>through</b> the enemy and inflicted several casualties. Kingsbury was then seen to fall, shot by a Japanese sniper and killed instantly. His actions, which delayed the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, were instrumental in saving his battalion's headquarters and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.|$|E
5|$|To {{overcome}} {{the constraints of}} the bocage that had made attacks so difficult and costly for both sides, Rhino modifications were made to some M4 Sherman, M5A1 Stuart tanks and M10 tank destroyers, by fitting them with hedge-breaching 'tusks' that could force <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>through</b> hedgerows. German tanks remained restricted to the roads but U.S. armored vehicles could maneuver more freely, although the effectiveness of the devices was exaggerated. By the eve of Cobra, 60 percent of the tanks of the First Army had the rhino modification. To preserve operational security, Bradley forbade their use until Cobra was launched. In all, 1,269 M4 medium tanks, 694 M5A1 light tanks and 288 M10 tank destroyers were available.|$|E
5|$|After passing The Lizard {{the path}} turns northwards, {{continuing}} past Housel Bay and a building used by Guglielmo Marconi for radio experiments, then Bass Point with its Coastguard Station. The Lizard lifeboat station is a sheltered position in Kilcobben Cove. Passing through Cadgwith and across Kennack Sands, the path heads towards Black Head then into Coverack. Once around Lowland Point, The Manacles lie a mile offshore, a reef that has wrecked many ships. The path passes through Porthoustock and Porthallow, then around Nare Point lies Gillan Creek. This can be crossed {{at very low}} tide, but most walkers follow the lanes round {{the head of the}} creek to reach Dennis Head {{at the mouth of the}} Helford River. To cross this wider river means following it inland to Helford where there is a ferry across to Helford Passage on the north bank. Some people take a short cut from Gillan Creek to Helford by <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>through</b> Manaccan.|$|E

5|$|After {{the arrival}} of the strikebreakers on the {{afternoon}} of November 2, Indianapolis Police Chief Martin Hyland had mounted city police escort them from Indianapolis Union Station to the company's maintenance and storage carhouses, one block south of the terminal building. The police broke <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>through</b> the strikers to allow the strikebreakers into the building so they could prepare to launch the cars. Organized labor leaders held two mass meetings and unions across the city agreed to send additional men to support the strikers against the strikebreakers. A riot began as the strikebreakers attempted to restore transit service. Whenever the strikebreakers launched a streetcar from the storage barns, the strikers attacked them with rocks and brick. They boarded the streetcars, dragged the crews from the cars and lit the cars on fire. Many injuries occurred on both sides and ambulances were called to carry the injured to a hospital. After the destruction of six cars, the strikebreakers abandoned their attempts to restart service.|$|E
5|$|At 14:30 on 6 November, UB-45 was departing Varna, Bulgaria, under escort by the Bulgarian {{torpedo boat}} Strogi that had cleared <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>through</b> Russian mines. At what {{was thought to}} be the edge of the minefield, UB-45 swung around Strogis port side {{directly}} into a second minefield that had been laid by Russian forces the night before. A Hertz horn mine exploded between UB-45s control room and engine room with enough force to break the boat in half. UB-45 sank so rapidly that the only survivors were three men on the conning tower and two on deck, all of whom were injured; the other fifteen men on board perished in the attack. One of the survivors died from the severity of his wounds the following day.|$|E

5|$|It is a {{tradition}} within the Australian Army for soldiers' recreational clubs on military bases to be named after a particular recipient of the Victoria Cross. Australia has a unique means of remembering recipients of the Victoria Cross. Remembrance Drive is <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>through</b> city streets and highways linking Sydney and Canberra. Trees were planted in February 1954 by Queen Elizabeth II in a park near Sydney Harbour and at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, marking {{either end of the}} route, with various plantations along the roadsides in memory of the fallen. Beginning in 1995, 23 rest stop memorials named for Australian recipients of the VC from World War II onwards have been sited along the route, providing picnic facilities and public amenities to encourage drivers to take a break on long drives. 23 of the 26 memorial sites have been dedicated, with a further three reserved for the surviving VC recipients, including two of the newer Victoria Cross for Australia awards. Edward Kenna, VC, was honoured with the most recent rest stop on 16 August 2012, having died in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Plectania nannfeldtii is {{typically}} found at higher elevations in coniferous forests growing on wet twigs or other rotting woody debris, often {{in or near}} snow. It often begins its development underneath the snow, reaching maturity as the snowbank recedes to expose it; one source suggests that its metabolic heat may help it melt <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>through</b> snow as it grows. It may grow singly, scattered or in clusters, and has been noted to have a preference for the wood of Picea engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa {{as well as other}} conifers. In North America, it is found in the Western United States and Canada, where it fruits from late May to early August; it is common in the Sierra Nevada and in higher elevations of the Pacific Coast Ranges. Its distribution also includes China and Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{developing}} extratropical cyclone spawned 16 known tornadoes and waterspouts in Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida, {{becoming the}} largest Christmas Day tornado outbreak on record. A short-lived F3 tornado touched down in Vermillion Parish, Louisiana, destroying eight homes near Kaplan and damaging 25 more. One woman {{was killed and}} eight were injured, three severely enough to require hospitalization. Another damaging tornado moved through several settlements in southern Iberville Parish just over two hours later; the tornado destroyed seven homes and damaged multiple other buildings, with one injury reported. The tornado was officially classified an F3, though meteorologist Thomas P. Grazulis determined it to have caused damage consistent with an F2 rating. A non-tornadic wind gust destroyed a nearby trailer home. Later that day, a tornado skipped along <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>through</b> Catahoula and Concordia parishes, touching down three different times. The F2 tornado damaged about 20 trailer homes in Glade, and caused further damage {{near the end of}} its track.|$|E

From here, a divisional pioneer party reached the front line at 07:00 on 19 September to cut a gap and flag <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>through</b> the Ottoman wire. By 08:40 permission was given by the 7th (Meerut) Division, which had attacked the western sector of the Tabsor defences, for the 4th Cavalry Division, accompanied by three horse artillery batteries which had rejoined the division after taking part in the bombardment and creeping barrage {{at the beginning of the}} Battle of Sharon, to pass through the gap in the Ottoman front line defences created by their attacks.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, to the south, Percy {{advanced}} with some 3,000 men. Percy advanced in two columns with his brigade of Hessians {{on the left}} and Percy himself leading the right. About 200 yards from the American lines Percy halted the advance, waiting for the feint by Stirling to take place. Facing Percy was Alexander Graydon and his company. Graydon's superior was Lambert Cadwalader, Magaw's second in command, {{who was in charge of}} holding the three defensive lines south of Fort Washington. After hearing that there was a landing on the shore in his rear, Cadwalader sent 50 men to oppose it. The 50 men ran into the feint by Col. Stirling's 42nd Foot of 700 men. Where Stirling landed happened to be the least defended area of the American defenses, and when Cadwalader heard how many men were there, he sent another 100 men to reinforce the 50 he had sent earlier. The British landing parties spread out, looking for <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>through</b> the rough terrain on the landing spot. The Americans took up a position on a hilltop and began firing at the British troops who were still crossing the river, killing or wounding 80 men. The British troops charged the American position, dispersing them.|$|E
5|$|Li Yuan's advance {{was stopped}} {{at a place called}} Guhubao for two weeks in late August due to heavy rainfall, giving time to the Sui {{authorities}} to react: the general Qutu Tong was sent to secure Hedong Commandery on the Yellow River, while another army, of 20,000 elite troops under Song Laosheng advanced north to the town of Huoyi, some 17 miles south of Guhubao, to confront him. Huoyi was placed on the southern exit of a defile through which the road passed, following the course of the Fen River, and provided an excellent position from which to check an army coming from the north. When Li Yuan's army learned of Song Laosheng's presence, some began advocating a retreat to Taiyuan, fearing that in their absence the Turks might break the treaty and attack it. A council was held, at which Li Yuan sided with his sons, who argued forcefully for continuing the campaign. Thus, on 8 September, after the rains stopped, Li Yuan's army set out from its encampment. Instead of following the road through the defile, however, they chose <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>through</b> the southeastern hills, allegedly revealed to them by a peasant.|$|E
