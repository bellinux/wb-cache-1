5|$|The Third Amendment {{restricts the}} {{quartering}} of soldiers in private homes, {{in response to}} Quartering Acts passed by the British parliament during the Revolutionary War. The <b>amendment</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the least}} controversial of the Constitution, and, , has never been the primary basis of a Supreme Court decision.|$|E

Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 77 are exceptions, as article 77 requires a referendum to amend these articles. During the interwar period <b>amendments</b> <b>were</b> rareonly one <b>amendment</b> <b>was</b> made and one major <b>amendment</b> <b>was</b> almost passed, but was never adopted due to the coup.

5|$|I {{would hold}} that {{officers}} {{must have some}} level of particularized suspicion in order to conduct a seizure and search {{like the one at}} issue here, because (1) seizing one’s personal property deprives the individual of his valid possessory interest in his property, and (2) authorizing a generalized computer forensic search (untethered to any particularized suspicion) permits the Government to engage in the type of generalized fishing expeditions that the Fourth <b>Amendment</b> <b>is</b> designed to prevent.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, the Department of Justice and Equality {{published}} the general scheme of a Marriage Bill 2015. The bill {{set out the}} changes {{to be made to}} legislation if the proposed amendment was approved. These changes included removing the existing legislative bar on same-sex couples marrying (though the wording of the <b>amendment</b> <b>is</b> self-executing and designed to invalidate it irrespective of legislative delay), addressing the situation of civil partnership, and updating terminology of existing legislation to reflect the new provision.|$|E
5|$|The Bricker <b>Amendment</b> <b>is</b> the {{collective}} {{name of a}} number of slightly different proposed amendments to the United States Constitution considered by the United States Senate in the 1950s. Each of these amendments would have insulated American laws and policies from foreign influence exerted through treaties, executive agreements, international law or the United Nations. They are named for their sponsor, Republican Senator John W. Bricker of Ohio.|$|E

5|$|The Third Amendment (Amendment III) to the United States Constitution places {{restrictions}} on the quartering of soldiers in private homes without the owner's consent, forbidding the practice in peacetime. The <b>amendment</b> <b>is</b> a response to Quartering Acts passed by the British parliament during the buildup to the American Revolutionary War, which had allowed the British Army to lodge soldiers in private residences.|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} met on October 25, 1933, and adjourned that day. It elected C. O’Connor Goolrick as its presiding officer. To answer Congressional legislation, it {{ratified the}} 21st Amendment repealing the 18th Amendment {{so as to}} allow the sale of alcoholic beverages. The 21st <b>Amendment</b> <b>is</b> the only amendment that required state convention ratification as of that time. The Amendment was ratified nationally by three-fourths of the states on December 5, 1933.|$|E
5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate: A Biography of the First <b>Amendment</b> <b>is</b> a 2007 non-fiction book by {{journalist}} Anthony Lewis {{about freedom}} of speech, {{freedom of the}} press, freedom of thought, and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The book starts by quoting the First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from creating legislation which limits free speech or freedom of the press. Lewis traces the evolution of civil liberties in the U.S. through key historical events. He {{provides an overview of}} important free speech case law, including U.S. Supreme Court opinions in Schenck v. United States (1919), Whitney v. California (1927), United States v. Schwimmer (1929), New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), and New York Times Co. v. United States (1971).|$|E

5|$|The Fourth Amendment guards against {{unreasonable}} {{searches and}} seizures, along with requiring any warrant to be judicially sanctioned {{and supported by}} probable cause. It was adopted {{as a response to}} the abuse of the writ of assistance, which is a type of general search warrant, in the American Revolution. Search and seizure (including arrest) must be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court, usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it. The <b>amendment</b> <b>is</b> the basis for the exclusionary rule, which mandates that evidence obtained illegally cannot be introduced into a criminal trial. The amendment's interpretation has varied over time; its protections expanded under left-leaning courts such as that headed by Earl Warren and contracted under right-leaning courts such as that of William Rehnquist.|$|E
5|$|This amendment, {{as well as}} the Fourteenth, is {{undoubtedly}} self-executing, without any ancillary legislation, so far as its terms are applicable to any existing state of circumstances. By its own unaided force and effect, it abolished slavery and established universal freedom. Still, legislation may be necessary and proper to meet all the various cases and circumstances to be affected by it, and to prescribe proper modes of redress for its violation in letter or spirit. And such legislation may be primary and direct in its character, for the <b>amendment</b> <b>is</b> not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{few times}} a federal court was asked to {{invalidate}} a law or action on Third Amendment grounds was in Engblom v. Carey (1982). In 1979, prison officials in New York organized a strike; they were evicted from their prison facility residences, which were reassigned to members of the National Guard who had temporarily taken their place as prison guards. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled: (1) that the term owner in the Third Amendment includes tenants (paralleling similar cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, governing search and seizure), (2) National Guard troops count as soldiers {{for the purposes of the}} Third Amendment, and (3) that the Third <b>Amendment</b> <b>is</b> incorporated (that is, that it applies to the states) by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case was remanded to the district court, which dismissed the case on the grounds that state officials could not have been aware of this interpretation.|$|E

5|$|White middle-class Indiana women learned {{organizational}} skills through the suffrage and temperance movements. By the 1890s they were applying their new {{skills to the}} needs of their home communities, by organizing women's clubs, the combined literary activity with social activism focused on such needs as public health, sanitation, and good schools. Hoosier women worked at both {{the state and local level}} to materialize Progressive Era reforms. In Lafayette, for example, the suffragists concentrated in the Lafayette Franchise League, while those oriented toward social concerns worked through the Lafayette Charity Organization Society (LCOS), the Free Kindergarten and Industrial School Association (FKISA), and the Martha Home. Albion Fellows Bacon led statewide and national efforts at housing reform. A native of Evansville, Bacon worked to pass tenement and housing legislation in Indiana in 1909, 1913, and 1917. She also held leadership roles in Indiana Child Welfare Association; the Child Welfare Committee, a part of the Women's Section of the Indiana State Council of Defense; the Indiana Conference of Charities and Corrections, and the Juvenile Advisory Commission of Indiana's Probation Department. Women in Indiana would officially gain the right to vote in 1920 when the 19th <b>Amendment</b> <b>is</b> ratified for the United States constitution.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{procedure}} for {{the adoption of the}} <b>amendment</b> <b>is</b> followed successfully, the <b>amendment</b> <b>is</b> formalized as a proclamation of the Governor General in Council. Officially, therefore, the Constitution is amended by Proclamation, and the issue of the Proclamation requires prior approval by resolutions of the House of Commons, the Senate, and the necessary number of provincial legislative assemblies.|$|E

50|$|The Second <b>Amendment</b> <b>was</b> not {{submitted}} to a referendum. Under Article 51 of the Transitory Provisions the constitution could be amended during the initial period of 1938 to 1941 {{without the need for}} a popular vote. The Second <b>Amendment</b> could therefore <b>be</b> adopted {{in the same manner as}} any other law. The <b>amendment</b> <b>was,</b> in part, adopted as the last chance to implement a list of desired changes before the provisions of Article 51 lapsed. The <b>amendment</b> <b>was</b> enacted during the Fianna Fáil government of Éamon de Valera.|$|R
