5|$|Take Off Your Pants and Jacket is {{the fourth}} studio album by American rock band Blink-182. Produced by Jerry Finn, the album was {{released}} on June 12, 2001, through MCA Records. The band {{had spent much of}} the previous year traveling and supporting their third album Enema of the State (1999), which launched the band's mainstream career. The title is a tongue-in-cheek pun on male masturbation ("take off your pants and jack it"). The cover art has icons for each member of the trio: an airplane ("take off"), <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pants,</b> and a jacket. The album's first, limited pressing came in three separate discs reflecting each icon and containing separate bonus tracks and joke songs.|$|E

Once at a local mall, he was detained by store detectives for switching the price tags on <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pants.</b> After hearing about his background, the department store manager declined to prosecute. Another time, he was caught using slugs on machines. He also used stolen credit cards on vacations.|$|E

500|$|The cover {{has three}} [...] "Zoso-like" [...] icons for each band member: a jacket, <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pants</b> and an {{airplane}}. Delonge and Hoppus' symbols became the pants and jacket, respectively, leaving Barker the airplane despite begging his bandmates not to assign him the symbol, citing {{his fear of}} flying, but he took it anyway. Ironically in 2008 Travis was {{in a plane crash}} fortunately surviving the wreck. Journalist Joe Shooman called the title [...] "a glint of sharp intelligence behind the boys' humour as it draws oblique attention to the fact that, latterly, Blink-182 had often been encouraged to get naked in order to promote themselves. It's a very self-aware album title in that context and a portent, perhaps, of what was to come".|$|E
500|$|Carey {{performed}} the song {{throughout the entire}} run of her Daydream World Tour (1996), Rainbow World Tour (2000), The Adventures of Mimi (2006), and The Elusive Chanteuse Show (2014) and during select shows on her [...] (2002–03), [...] and Angels Advocate Tour (2009–10). During the Japanese shows in 1996, Carey donned a white suit and jacket, and featured three female back-up singers. Red spotlights were used throughout the performance, {{as well as some}} light dance routines. During her Rainbow World Tour, Carey wore a two piece outfit, <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pants</b> and top, with golden heels. Three back-up singers were provided, one male and two female, while Carey interacted with the front row fans. On her Adventures of Mimi Tour in 2006, Carey donned a pair of black leggings, worn with a bikini-like top. Wearing Christian Louboutin pumps, Carey sang on the arena's secondary stage, where she sang three of the set-list's titles. On her Elusive Chanteuse Show in 2014, Carey often used the song as her encore, entering the stage in a tight-fitted blue gown and black gloves. Carey included the song in her 2015 Las Vegas residency, Mariah Carey Number 1's, where she walked through the audience for the second verse and chorus.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{time after}} the {{beginning}} of the pull, the other arm begins its recovery. The recovery moves the elbow in a semicircle in a vertical plane in the swimming direction. The lower arm and the hand are completely relaxed and hang down from the elbow close to the water surface and close to the swimmer's body. The beginning of the recovery looks similar to pulling the hand out of the back pocket of <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pants,</b> with the small finger upwards. Further into the recovery phase, the hand movement has been compared to pulling up a center zip on a wetsuit. [...] The recovering hand moves forward, with the fingers trailing downward, just above the surface of the water. In the middle of the recovery one shoulder is rotated forward into the air while the other is pointing backwards to avoid drag due to the large frontal area which at this specific time is not covered by the arm. To rotate the shoulder, some twist their torso while others also rotate everything down to their feet.|$|E
2500|$|During the evidentiary {{hearing for}} the Arnold Minor murder case, {{the judge ruled}} that {{evidence}} of the other Genesee County attacks {{could be used in}} the trial. The trial began on May 8, 2012. The prosecution's key piece of evidence was a drop of Minor's blood on <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pants</b> found in Abeulezam's luggage. On May 15, the prosecution rested after calling 50 witnesses, including other victims and their relatives, several forensic experts, as well as Abuelazam's uncle who assisted police in his capture. Two days later on May 17, Abuelazam's attorneys presented an insanity defense. Their sole expert witness was a psychiatrist hired by his attorneys who diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia and said Abuelazam told him he committed the crimes because of [...] "evil spirits." [...] The doctor also said Abuelazam told him he attempted suicide in 1997 and was diagnosed as psychotic by an Israeli psychologist in 2009. The prosecution responded by attacking the psychiatrist's credibility, noting that his field of expertise was addiction medicine. The next day, the prosecution refuted the psychiatrist's diagnosis with two of their own mental health experts. Two psychologists who testified on behalf of the prosecution agreed that although Abuelazam has an unspecified personality disorder and he lacked empathy, his attacks were too planned out and organized for him to be considered legally insane. On May 22, 2012, after only an hour of deliberation, the jury found Abuelazam guilty of Minor's murder. On June 25, 2012, Abuelazam was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.|$|E

5000|$|A 1996 {{study shows}} that <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Dockers <b>pants</b> often had a price range <b>of</b> $50-$80 per <b>pair.</b> <b>A</b> study in 2014 helped compare older prices to more current prices within the Dockers label. This article shows that in 2014 <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Dockers <b>pants</b> sells for roughly $140 and a long sleeve shirt reaches prices as high as $120. [...] Because of these prices, Dockers {{can be viewed as}} a brand favored by more {{affluent}} households. In 2012, 27.9 percent of respondents who came from a household where the annual income was $200,000 or more stated that they owned Dockers brand apparel, accessories, and footwear.|$|R

60|$|It is a {{very hard}} job at Goboto. That is why the pay is twice that on other stations, {{and that is why}} the company selects only courageous and intrepid men for this {{particular}} station. They last no more than a year or so, when the wreckage of them is shipped back to Australia, or the remains of them are buried in the sand across on the windward side of the islet. Johnny Bassett, almost the legendary hero of Goboto, broke all records. He was a remittance man with a remarkable constitution, and he lasted seven years. His dying request was duly observed by his clerks, who pickled him in a cask of trade-rum (paid for out of their own salaries) and shipped him back to his people in England. Nevertheless, at Goboto, they tried to be gentlemen. For that matter, though something was wrong with them, they were gentlemen, and had been gentlemen. That was why the great unwritten rule of Goboto was that visitors should put on pants and shoes. Breech-clouts, lava-lavas, and bare legs were not tolerated. When Captain Jensen, the wildest of the Blackbirders though descended from old New York Knickerbocker stock, surged in, clad in loin-cloth, undershirt, two belted revolvers and a sheath-knife, he was stopped at the beach. This was in the days of Johnny Bassett, ever a stickler in matters of etiquette. Captain Jensen stood up in the sternsheets of his whaleboat and denied the existence of pants on his schooner. Also, he affirmed his intention of coming ashore. They of Goboto nursed him back to health from a bullet-hole through his shoulder, and in addition handsomely begged his pardon, for no pants had they found on his schooner. And finally, on the first day he sat up, Johnny Bassett kindly but firmly assisted his guest into <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pants</b> of his own. This was the great precedent. In all the succeeding years it had never been violated. White men and pants were undivorce-able. Only niggers ran naked. Pants constituted caste.|$|E

50|$|As said in {{the lead}} <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pants</b> is any surface which is homeomorphic to a sphere with three holes, which {{formally}} are three disjoint open disks removed from the sphere.
