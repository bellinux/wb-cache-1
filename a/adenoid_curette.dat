40|$|Objective. <b>Adenoid</b> <b>curette</b> {{guided by}} an {{indirect}} transoral mirror and a headlight {{is a simple}} and quick procedure {{that has already been}} in use for a long time, but this method carries a high risk of recurrence unless done by a well-experienced surgeon. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the efficacy of transoral endoscopic adenoidectomy in relieving the obstructive nasal symptoms. Methods. 300 children underwent transoral endoscopic adenoidectomy using the classic <b>adenoid</b> <b>curette</b> and St Claire Thomson forceps with a 70 ∘ Hopkins 4 -mm nasal endoscope introduced through the mouth and the view was projected on a monitor. Telephone questionnaire was used to follow-up the children for one year. Flexible nasopharyngoscopy was carried out for children with recurrent obstructive nasal symptoms to detect adenoid rehypertrophy. Results. No cases presented with postoperative complications. Only one case developed recurrent obstructive nasal symptoms due to adenoid regrowth and investigations showed that he had nasal allergy which may be the cause of recurrence. Conclusion. Transoral endoscopic adenoidectomy is the recent advancement of classic curettage adenoidectomy with direct vision of the nasopharynx that enables the surgeon to avoid injury of important structures as Eustachian tube orifices, and also it gives him the chance to completely remove the adenoidal tissues...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. Although {{postoperative}} complications are rare, postadenoidectomy hemorrhage {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequent. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the incidence and timing of postadenoidectomy hemorrhage requiring hemostatic control under endotracheal anesthesia. Methods. A two-year prospective study of patients undergoing inpatient adenoidectomy, with (n = 462) or without tonsillectomy (n = 589), was undertaken. Surgery was performed in endotracheal anesthesia using an <b>adenoid</b> <b>curette.</b> Every bleeding event which needed procedure in general anesthesia for its treatment was recorded. The timing of postadenoidectomy hemorrhage was classified as primary or secondary. Results. Severe bleeding following adenoidectomy with tonsillectomy which needed hemostatic control under endotracheal anesthesia occurred in only 0. 19 % (2 / 1051) patients (average age = 7. 5 years). Postadenoidectomy hemorrhage was primary in both of the patients. Conclusion. Severe postoperative hemorrhage requiring hemostasis under endotracheal anesthesia can be expected in a small number of children undergoing adenoidectomy with tonsillectomy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionAdenoid {{hypertrophy}} {{may play}} a role in velopharyngeal closure especially in patients with palatal abnormality; adenoidectomy may lead to velopharyngeal insufficiency and hyper nasal speech. Patients with cleft palate even after repair should not undergo adenoidectomy unless absolutely needed, and in such situations, conservative or partial adenoidectomy is performed to avoid the occurrence of velopharyngeal insufficiency. Trans-oral endoscopic adenoidectomy enables the surgeon to inspect the velopharyngeal valve during the procedure. ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to assess the effect of transoral endoscopic partial adenoidectomy on the speech of children with repaired cleft palate. MethodsTwenty children with repaired cleft palate underwent transoral endoscopic partial adenoidectomy to relieve their airway obstruction. The procedure was completely visualized with the use of a 70 ° 4 mm nasal endoscope; the upper part of the adenoid was removed using <b>adenoid</b> <b>curette</b> and St. Claire Thompson forceps, while the lower part was retained to maintain the velopharyngeal competence. Preoperative and postoperative evaluation of speech was performed, subjectively by auditory perceptual assessment, and objectively by nasometric assessment. ResultsSpeech was not adversely affected after surgery. The difference between preoperative and postoperative auditory perceptual assessment and nasalance scores for nasal and oral sentences was insignificant (p= 0. 231, 0. 442, 0. 118 respectively). ConclusionsTransoral endoscopic partial adenoidectomy is a safe method; it does not worsen the speech of repaired cleft palate patients. It enables the surgeon to strictly inspect the velopharyngeal valve during the procedure with better determination of the adenoidal part that may contribute in velopharyngeal closure...|$|E
30|$|Historically {{recommended}} instrumentation {{for performing}} adenoidectomy has varied from the surgeon’s fingernail, a steel nail, cutting or biting forceps, adenotomes and <b>adenoid</b> <b>curettes</b> (Jonas et al. 2007). The conventional curettage adenoidectomy was first described in 1885 (Thornval 1969), {{and since then}} it has been considered {{the most commonly used}} surgical technique for adenoidectomy (Costantini et al. 2008). Conventional curettage for removing adenoids uses the nasopharyngeal touch method to estimate the size of the adenoid and the relationship to the surrounding structure, in order to choose the suitable adenoidectomy curette to scrape the adenoid tissue in the rhinopharynx transorally behind the nose.|$|R

In the theoretical part, the present design issues of the cutting curette are shown, and time consumption and wear problems of sterilisation are described. Experimental part consists in selection of suitable metal powder for medical application, computeraided engineering (CAE) Moldflow analysis of proper gating system followed by construction of injection mold and production of real samples. The new design of replaceable cutting edge is easily customized according to various shapes of patient oral cavity and for doctor's need. © 2016. Published by Manufacturing Technology...|$|R

40|$|On {{the forty}} children, age ranging from 2 years 11 months to 17 years 3 months and {{diagnosed}} as having adenoids, the anthor made the epipharynx molds by inserting alginic impression material into their epipharyx under aether narcosis. With {{the use of these}} molds the author carried out the morphological study of their epipharynx, and obtained the following results: 1. The mean average of the width of pharyngeal tonsil is 20 mm, and in the majority of the children it is wider than the width of <b>adenoid</b> <b>curette.</b> 2. In those children with middle ear disease the width of pharyngeal tonsil is greater than the longitudinal length, and also it is bigger than the width of the same in those children without any disorders in the middle ear. 3. The pharyngeal recess is smaller and shallower than that in the adult autopsy case. This seems to be {{due to the fact that}} lymphatic tissue is filling up the pharyngeal recess in children. 4. No variation can be recognized in the length, width and depth of ostium of auditory tube by age, sex, and presence or absence of disease. 5. The distance beween tubal lips in children coincides roughly with that in adult autopsy case. 6. The height, width, and cross-section of the choana in children are about one half to two thirds of those in adult autopsy case. The height is shorter in comparison with the width, resembling the choana of foetus and newborn. However, with advance in age the measurements tend to approach those of adult. 7. The distance between the posterior wall of naso-pharynx and the palate is narrowest at the distance covering 8 - 12 mm from the posterior inferior end of nasal septum. This point corresponds approximately the center of pharyngeal tonsil. 8. The cross-section of the narrowest point in epipharynx is a little over one square centimeter...|$|E
