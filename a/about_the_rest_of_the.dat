25|$|Next up for Powell was the Diamond League Athletissima in Lausanne on 30 June. In chilly conditions, {{not ideal}} for sprinting, the former world record holder bulleted {{out of his}} blocks {{and ran to the}} tape, {{recording}} a world-leading 9.78s with a following wind of 1.0m/s. Powell was indeed happy with his strong performance, his fastest in three years and was full of confidence <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season and the IAAF World Championships in Daegu, South Korea in late August. Next up for Powell was the IAAF Diamond League Meeting in Birmingham, England on 10 July. He became the first man in history to break the 10 seconds barrier in the Sir Alexander Stadium when he clocked a very easy looking 9.95s in his heat. Later, in the final he eased to a 9.91s victory where compatriots Nesta Carter and Michael Frater finished second and third respectively. Powell was satisfied with both his races, stating that he took both the races easy due to very chilly and rainy conditions. Asafa seemed more and more confident heading into the World Championships in late August. Powell next competed on 30 July in Budapest at the Hungarian Grand Prix. He ran 9.90s in his heats and eased through the final to win in 9.86s, having following winds of 1.8m/s and 2.0m/s respectively, in cold conditions.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers at The A.V. Club {{agreed that}} the scene between Coach and his {{daughter}} at the office is the most redeeming part of the episode, but they have mixed feelings <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode. Ryan McGee found this episode too draggy and found Coach's daughter—Lisa—underdeveloped. Meredith Blake found this episode [...] "underwhelming". Others praised this episode overall, including moments outside the story of Coach's daughter. Erik Adams observed that Coach can immediately sense a bad aspect about Roy, even when he is a [...] "simpleton".|$|E

500|$|The {{series was}} welcomed as [...] "the British Thirtysomething" [...] {{and there was}} {{additional}} publicity generated {{off the back of}} Helen Baxendale's appearances in Friends. The first two episodes did not impress critics; The Independents Nicholas Barber called Episode 1 [...] "the most depressing programme [...] ever seen". Commenting on the ending, he observed that [...] "in comedyland, the police's main duty is to taxi expectant fathers to hospital". Barber concluded his review with positive comments <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series, singling out Ripley as being [...] "reminiscent of Elaine in Seinfeld". A.A. Gill also criticised that episode's conclusion, comparing it to a Norman Wisdom comedy. On The Late Review, Germaine Greer described Nesbitt's acting as [...] "especially awful" [...] and suggested that the series had been developed by a marketing department.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Locus, Clarke explains why and how she integrated the theme of [...] "Englishness" [...] into Jonathan Strange: [...] "I wanted to explore my ideas of the fantastic, {{as well as my}} ideas of England and my attachment to English landscape....Sometimes it feels to me as though we don't have a fable of England, of Britain, something strong and idealized and romantic. I was picking up on things like Chesterton and Conan Doyle, and the sense (which is also in Jane Austen) of what it was to be an English gentleman at the time when England was a very confident place". In particular, [...] "it's the sort of Englishness which is stuffy but fundamentally benevolent, and fundamentally very responsible <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world", which connects Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes to Clarke's Jonathan Strange.|$|E
500|$|Ben, {{although}} extremely well-mannered, has an impeccable {{ability to}} lie and manipulate {{the people around}} him, even when he is at a physical disadvantage. He often speaks in a low, emotionless monotone when at his most unreadable, frequently sprinkling his speech with sarcasm or dry, humorless jokes. He can also be petty and vindictive, {{even to the point}} of murder, when he does not get what he wants. He claims to have been born on the Island, leading to him being thought of as a miracle by the Others, as pregnant women die on the island; but later confesses to Locke that he was lying. He unsuccessfully tries to convince the survivors he is Henry Gale, although succeeds in manipulating Locke to turn against Jack while held prisoner under this guise. While he claims he will not sacrifice innocent lives in order to accomplish his goals, he has been shown to do quite the opposite. In the third-season finale, Ben is informed by Tom Friendly (M. C. Gainey), an Other, that they have captured three of the crash survivors: Sayid Jarrah, Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson), and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). When Tom tells Ben they are unwilling to reveal any information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> survivors, Ben quickly replies [...] "Shoot Kwon... You want them to answer questions, kill Kwon - do it now". Conversely, Ben refuses to allow his spy on the freighter to destroy it long before it reaches the Island, as he would not kill anyone who [...] "did not deserve to die". Furthermore, when Locke confronts Ben about causing the freighter to explode, Ben coldly replies, [...] "So?" ...|$|E

2500|$|After taking {{possession}} of the city, Sultan Mehmed garrisoned his Janissaries in Trebizond’s imperial castle; Kritobulos states that the garrison numbered 400. He placed Emperor David, {{his family and his}} relatives, his officials and their families with all of their wealth on the Sultan's triremes which took them to Constantinople. The rest of the inhabitants of Trebizond, however, were treated less hospitably. According to Pseudo-Chalkokondyles, they were divided into three groups: one group was forced to leave Trebizond and resettle in Constantinople; the next group became slaves either of the Sultan or of his dignitaries; and the last group were left to live in the countryside surrounding Trebizond, but not within its walls. Kritobulos states that only [...] "some of the most influential men of the city" [...] were forced to resettle in Constantinople, while stating nothing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants. The Sultan also took hundreds of children to become his personal slaves: while Kritobulos states that Mehmed took 1500 children of both sexes to be his slaves, Pseudo-Chalkokondyles writes only that he took 800 male children became recruits for his Janissaries, the elite Ottoman military unit, which required them to convert to Islam.|$|E
