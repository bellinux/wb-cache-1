500|$|Whatever {{the truth}} of the rumours, James {{required}} a royal match to preserve the Stuart line. [...] "God is my witness", he explained, [...] "I could have abstained longer than the weal of my country could have permitted, [...] my long delay bred in the breasts of many a great jealousy of my inability, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> barren stock." [...] On 20 August 1589, Anne was married by proxy to James at Kronborg Castle, the ceremony ending with James' representative, George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal, sitting next to Anne on the bridal bed.|$|E

2500|$|Her final {{performances}} {{included the}} 2003 Sydney Cabaret Convention where she received two standing ovations for her {{performances of the}} jazz anthem [...] "Something Cool" [...] and Stephen Sondheim's [...] "Send in the Clowns". Dr David Schwartz, writing for Cabaret Hotline Online said in his review, [...] "It is hard to describe her to you without sounding <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> little bit insane. Her performance provided me {{with one of those}} life-changing and totally defining cabaret experiences that was instantly committed to memory, along with my first exposure to Mabel Mercer, Julie Wilson, Sarah Vaughan, Sylvia Syms {{and a host of other}} greats. Gery Scott's set represented that rare moment in cabaret when the singer and her song are indistinguishable. This sort of alchemy comes only after many years; to witness it is to be blessed".

6000|$|BURGE-LUBIN [injured] Really, Mrs Lutestring! You speak <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> {{notoriously}} indiscreet person. Barnabas: have I such a reputation? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> lucky!" [...] he remarked, and Barbara {{imagined}} his {{not finding}} Mrs. Cartwright about accounted for his satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|Therefore it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{assisting}} {{in an attempt}} to take my own life, when I did as Simon Kenton bid.|$|R
