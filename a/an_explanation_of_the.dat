In mid-January 2007, a volume key was published by {{another member of the}} Doom9 forum along with <b>an</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technique used to obtain it. Other forum members quickly discovered keys for different titles. Keys for many discs are now readily available on the internet.|$|E

5|$|On 13 December 1562, Mary {{sent for}} Knox again after {{he gave a}} sermon denouncing certain {{celebrations}} which Knox had interpreted as rejoicing {{at the expense of}} the Reformation. She charged that Knox spoke irreverently of the Queen in order to make her appear contemptible to her subjects. After Knox gave <b>an</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sermon, Mary stated that she did not blame Knox for the differences of opinion and asked that in the future he come to her directly if he heard anything about her that he disliked. Despite her friendly gesture, Knox replied that he would continue to voice his convictions in his sermons and would not wait upon her.|$|E
5|$|As Longstreet's left division, under Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws, advanced, they {{unexpectedly}} found Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles's III Corps {{directly in}} their path. Sickles had been {{dissatisfied with the}} position assigned him on {{the southern end of}} Cemetery Ridge. Seeing ground better suited for artillery positions a half mile (800m) to the west— centered at the Sherfy farm's Peach Orchard—he violated orders and advanced his corp to the slightly higher ground along the Emmitsburg Road, moving away from Cemetery Ridge. The new line ran from Devil's Den, northwest to the Peach Orchard, then northeast along the Emmitsburg Road to south of the Codori farm. This created an untenable salient at the Peach Orchard; Brig. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys's division (in position along the Emmitsburg Road) and Maj. Gen. David B. Birney's division (to the south) were subject to attacks from two sides and were spread out over a longer front than their small corps could defend effectively. The Confederate artillery was ordered to open fire at 3:00p.m. After failing to attend a meeting at this time of Meade's corps commanders, Meade rode to Sickles' position and demanded <b>an</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation. Knowing a Confederate attack was imminent and a retreat would be endangered, Meade refused Sickles' offer to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Operation Maslenica, RSK president Goran Hadžić ordered the ARSK to retrieve its tanks from UN storage in Sector West and attack Nova Gradiška and Novska. When local RSK authorities (led by Veljko Džakula in Sector West) demanded <b>an</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> order from Hadžić, {{he said that}} the Croatian forces were about to attack Okučani. On 26 January Zabala met with Džakula in Okučani and reassured him that the UNPROFOR would protect Sector West from a Croatian attack, agreeing to provide the RSK with a written guarantee to that effect. Although Hadžić accepted the assurance and cancelled the attack, the orders were reinstated and cancelled three more times over the next two days. On 7 February, Canadian troops drilled the deck of the bridge spanning the Strug Channel (north of Stara Gradiška) to place demolition charges. The move was protested by RSK authorities, who saw the route (the only link between Okučani and Serb-controlled territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina) as crucial to an evacuation {{in the event of an}} anticipated Croatian attack. The situation calmed down by mid-February, and the HV did not attack Sector West.|$|E

5|$|The three member team is {{composed}} of Edward Tolby, his daughter, Silvia Tolby (of unspecified age, but vaguely described as an adolescent or young adult), and their mutual friend, Robert Penn. While {{en route to the}} valley, the team arrives in a small rural town by the name of Fairfax. Fairfax is littered with ancient, decaying gadgets; the last remnants of the era of governments and high tech society, which none of the locals know how to fix or reproduce. Excited by the strangers, the locals ask about the League. Tolby answers their questions in turn, ending with <b>an</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> timeline of events which led up to the great revolt. The event is summarized as having begun with revolts in Europe which overthrow the national governments. After France exists for a month free of government, millions join the by then explicitly anarchist movement to disarm the nuclear powers. At each toppled government center, millions of records are burned and government integration robots are destroyed. These events result in the setting of the story; a world full of anachronistic high-technology, interspersed in a pre-industrialized, agrarian culture.|$|E
