The vacuum cleaner generates a vacuum inside the sieving chamber and sucks in fresh air through the slotted nozzle. When passing the narrow slit of the nozzle the air stream is accelerated and blown against the sieve mesh, dispersing the particles. Above the mesh, the <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> is distributed over the complete sieve surface and is sucked in with low speed through the sieve mesh.

There is a stagnation point opposite the source. The dashed lines, colored in red, are those most strongly modified.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical {{investigation of the}} structure of plane underexpanded turbulent <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> in water was conducted to characterize their structure and mixing properties. Measurements included void fraction profiles, static pressure distributions, entrainment rates, and high speed flow visualization. A locally homogeneous flow model was also developed with compressibility effects treated using an effective adapted jet condition. Static pressure measurements confirmed the presence of a shock-wave-containing external expansion region for underexpanded <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> in water, similar to results observed for underexpanded <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> in <b>air.</b> In addition, the plane jets exhibited half-widths (based on void fractions) that were two to three times greater than half-widths (based on scalar properties) observed for single-phase jets. This behavior follows from the strong sensitivity of void fraction to mixing levels due to the large density ratio of the flow. Predictions of void fraction and mass entrainment were encouraging, but performance was found to be sensitive to initial conditions and effects of large-scale unsteadiness near the jet exit...|$|R

The flow fields for two different air inlet configurations were measured and analysed under isothermal and cooling conditions. Furthermore the flow rates at the different air inlet positions were varied while keeping the air exchange rate constant.

40|$|Abstract. Melt blowing is {{a typical}} {{nonwoven}} process for producing superfine fibers. In this process, the high velocity hot <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> attenuate the polymer melt into superfine fibers. Therefore, the fiber diameter is strongly affected by the air flow field. Dual slot die {{is one of the}} widely used melt blowing dies. Hot air emits from the two slots symmetrically. What will happen to the polymer drawing if the <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> are unsymmetrical? In this paper, the unsymmetrical air flow field of the dual slot die in melt blowing process is simulated numerically. The distributions of air velocity and air temperature are obtained. The polymer drawing model is then solved with the aid of the simulation results of air velocity and air temperature. The diameter and transverse displacement of the threadline along the spinline is achieved. The result shows that the threadline diameter of unsymmetrical air flow field is larger than that of the symmetrical air flow field and the threadline tends to deflect because of the unsymmetrical <b>air</b> <b>jets.</b> This paper helps to indicate the research direction for further decreasing the fiber diameter of melt blown nonwoven fabrics...|$|R
