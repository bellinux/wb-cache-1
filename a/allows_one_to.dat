This <b>allows</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> reconcile the discontinuously changing energy of the atom (the jump between energy states) with the continuous release of energy as radiation.|$|E
5|$|If a photon {{did have}} non-zero mass, {{there would be}} other effects as well. Coulomb's law would be {{modified}} and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence {{of the speed of}} light. If Coulomb's law is not exactly valid, then that would allow the presence of an electric field to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field. This thus <b>allows</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> test Coulomb's law to very high precision. A null result of such an experiment has set a limit of m ≲ 10−14eV/c2.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{began writing}} The Dry Salvages {{at the end}} of 1940 during air-raids on London, and managed to finish the poem quickly. The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, there is a connection to all of mankind within each man. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{it will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past in order to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning <b>allows</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> experience eternity through moments of revelation.|$|E

5|$|Jonathan later meets baron William Anthonio Zeppeli, {{a master}} of the martial arts {{technique}} Hamon, which <b>allows</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> channel sunlight through one's breathing. Zeppeli teaches Hamon to Jonathan, and they fight zombies Dio has raised; Zeppeli sacrifices himself to save Jonathan from one, and transfers his Hamon power to him. Jonathan confronts Dio, and seemingly defeats him, but Dio survives by severing his own head. Speedwagon destroys the stone mask, and Jonathan marries Erina and boards a ship to America with her. With the help of Wang Chan, Dio's still living head follows them while hiding in a coffin, planning to kill Jonathan and take over his body; he fatally wounds Jonathan, but during the struggle they accidentally jam the ship's engine, triggering an explosion. Erina escapes, while Dio sinks {{to the bottom of the}} ocean together with Jonathan's dead body.|$|E
5|$|Score Entertainment {{created a}} Sonic X {{collectible}} card game for two players, released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and flip over {{one at a}} time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards <b>allows</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> score rings; whichever player has the most rings {{at the end of}} the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it feels more like a generic card game with Sonic characters than like a wholly Sonic-based product.|$|E
5|$|The GHMix2.0 mode <b>allows</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> {{precisely}} create songs up to 10 min, {{and includes}} pre-defined sample tracks {{that can be}} modified on a note-by-note basis as desired. The new Jam mode lets the players select one of several standard pre-set rhythms and then play along with it on the instrument controllers in a free-form mode; however, players can then capture any segment of this music and move it to the Mix mode to compile a song. User songs are then uploaded and downloaded through the GHTunes mode of the Music Studio. While songs that violate copyright will still {{be removed from the}} service, Neversoft will be less aggressive about this and will rely more on user feedback on such issues. The PS2 version does not support this feature.|$|E

5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning <b>allows</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are able to join the eternal.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the poems, the end {{becomes the}} {{beginning}} and things constantly repeat. This use of circular time {{is similar to the}} way Dante uses time in his Divine Comedy – Little Gidding ends with a rose garden image that {{is the same as the}} garden beginning Burnt Norton. The repetition of time affects memory and how one can travel through their own past to find permanency and the divine. Memory within the poem is similar to how St. Augustine discussed it, in that memory <b>allows</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> understand words and life. The only way to discover eternity is through memory, understanding the past, and transcending beyond time. Likewise, in the Augustinian view that Eliot shares, timeless words are connected to Christ as the Logos and how Christ calls upon mankind to join him in salvation.|$|E
