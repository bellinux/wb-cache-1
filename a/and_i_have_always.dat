500|$|Following the episode's broadcast, the Fox network {{received}} several angry letters and emails from concerned Catholics, who were uneasy with the commercial scene. According to Scully, {{the letters were}} worded the same, and all started with [...] "My family <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> enjoyed The Simpsons, until last night..." [...] Nevertheless, the letters provoked a reaction from The Simpsons staff, and in an interview, Scully said, [...] "We {{got a couple of}} hundred letters, and it was very obvious from reading a majority of them that [...] had not seen the show. Some of them were from third-graders, all saying the same thing: 'Please don't make fun of my religion.' Which we all know third-graders are very adamant about." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1794, Wellesley {{experienced}} {{his first}} battle, against the French, at the Battle of Boxtel with the 33rd. His promotion to colonel, on 3 May 1796, came by seniority, and in June {{he was sent}} with the 33rd to India. In 1799 he fought in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, commanding three victorious actions with the British East India Company. After winning the war, and serving as governor of Seringapatam and Mysore, Wellesley was promoted to major-general on 29 April 1802, {{although he did not}} receive the news until September. Whilst in India he wrote of his regiment [...] "I have commanded them for nearly ten years during which I have scarcely been away from them <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> found them to be the quietest and best behaved body of men in the army." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} to General George Marshall on 24 August, Eisenhower praised Patton's {{exploits}} as commander of the Seventh Army and his conduct of the Sicily campaign, particularly his ability to take initiative as a commander. Still, Eisenhower noted Patton continued [...] "to exhibit some of those unfortunate traits of which you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> known." [...] He informed Marshall of the two incidents and his requirement that Patton apologize. Eisenhower stated he believed Patton would cease his behavior [...] "because fundamentally, he is so avid for recognition as a great military commander that he will ruthlessly suppress any habit of his that will tend to jeopardize it." [...] When Eisenhower arrived in Sicily to award Montgomery the Legion of Merit on 29 August, Patton gave him a letter expressing his remorse about the incidents.|$|E

Jack <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been bosom friends, <b>and,</b> {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> lost my sweetheart, I {{did not intend}} to lose my friend into the bargain. Sara had made a wise choice, for Jack was twice the man <b>I</b> was; he <b>had</b> had to work for his living, which perhaps accounts for it.|$|R
60|$|Father <b>and</b> Murray <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> {{lived here}} together. Father's health broke down during his college course. That {{was one reason}} why Uncle Abimelech was set against Murray going to college, {{although}} Murray is as chubby and sturdy a fellow as you could wish to see. Anybody with Foster in him would be that.|$|R
500|$|That year Kaif also {{appeared}} with Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma in Yash Chopra's swan song, the romance Jab Tak Hai Jaan. About working with Chopra, she remarked that he [...] "undoubtedly {{is the king}} of romance <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> admired the way he presents his heroines. It was always a dream {{to work with him}} and the reality is even better". She played Meera, a woman who promises God to end her affair with her comatose lover if he survives. Although the film received mostly positive reviews, Kaif's performance had a mixed reception. CNN-IBN wrote: [...] "Meera's role was a difficult one and Katrina falls short in emotional scenes. It seems Katrina still doesn't feel very easy {{in front of the camera}} and has difficulty with complex expressions". Commercially, the film proved a box-office hit with revenues of [...] worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Truman's brief vice-presidency was {{relatively}} uneventful. On April 10, 1945, Truman cast his only tie-breaking vote as President of the Senate, against a Robert A. Taft {{amendment that would}} have blocked the postwar delivery of Lend-Lease Act items contracted for during the war. Roosevelt rarely contacted him, even to inform him of major decisions; the President and Vice President met alone together only twice during their time in office. In {{one of his first}} acts as vice president, Truman created some controversy when he attended the disgraced Pendergast's funeral. He brushed aside the criticism, saying simply, [...] "He was always my friend <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been his." [...] He had rarely discussed world affairs or domestic politics with Roosevelt; he was uninformed about major initiatives relating to the war and the top-secret Manhattan Project, which was about to test the world's first atomic bomb. He was also photographed with actress Lauren Bacall sitting atop the piano at the National Press Club as he played for soldiers.|$|E
500|$|During this period, Hershey {{changed her}} stage name to [...] "Seagull". In 1979, a blunt {{newspaper}} article from the Knight News Service referenced {{this period of}} her life, saying of her acting career that [...] "it {{looked as if she}} blew it." [...] The article referred to Hershey as a [...] "kook" [...] and stated that she was frequently [...] "high on something." [...] In addition to that criticism, she had been ostracized for breast-feeding her son during an appearance on The Dick Cavett Show, and for breast-feeding him beyond the age of two years. She said that this period of her life hurt her career; [...] "Producers wouldn't see me because I had a reputation for using drugs and being undependable. I never used drugs at all <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been serious about my acting career." [...] After splitting up with Carradine, she changed her stage name back to [...] "Hershey", explaining that she had told the story of why she adopted the name [...] "Seagull" [...] so many times that it had lost its meaning.|$|E
5000|$|My {{experience}} with death is that {{apart from a}} lot of people hugging at funerals, it seldom brings people together. It actually tears them apart. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> learned from TV that death made everybody stronger and better and learn about themselves. And my experience was that an important piece had been taken out of the puzzle ... and there is no glorious payoff. Joss Whedon, 2008 ...|$|R
60|$|The {{personal}} {{appearance of the}} enigmatical stranger suggested additional perplexities. The face, free from tattooing, and the unshaven crown, were peculiarities <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never before remarked {{in any part of}} the island, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> heard that the contrary were considered the indispensable distinctions of a Marquesan warrior. Altogether the matter was perfectly incomprehensible to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> awaited its solution with no small degree of anxiety.|$|R
60|$|When I {{asked her}} why, she replied that she feared the maid was {{somewhat}} selfish, also too fond of drawing {{the eyes of}} men, and of the adornment of her beauty. Of those who were dearest to me, indeed, only Steinar seemed to think Iduna as perfect as I did myself. This, {{so far as it}} went, was well; but, then, Steinar <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> thought alike, which robbed his judgment of something of its worth.|$|R
500|$|Britten was, as he acknowledged, {{notorious for}} dumping {{friends and colleagues}} who either {{offended}} him or ceased to be of use â€“ his [...] "corpses". The conductor Sir Charles Mackerras believed that the term was invented by Lord Harewood. Both Mackerras and Harewood joined the list of corpses, the former for joking {{that the number of}} boys in Noye's Fludde must have been a delight to the composer, and the latter for an extramarital affair and subsequent divorce from Lady Harewood, which shocked the puritanical Britten. Among other corpses were his librettists Montagu Slater and Eric Crozier. The latter said in 1949, [...] "He has sometimes told me, jokingly, that one day I would join the ranks of his 'corpses' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> recognized that any ordinary person must soon outlive his usefulness to such a great creative artist as Ben." [...] Dame Janet Baker said in 1981, [...] "I think he was quite entitled to take what he wanted from others... He did not want to hurt anyone, but the task in hand was more important than anything or anybody." [...] Matthews feels that this aspect of Britten has been exaggerated, and he observes that the composer sustained many deep friendships {{to the end of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|A Kryptonian {{general and}} {{megalomaniac}} {{with the same}} superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day. That's a good way to find your way 'into it' [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Outside {{her acting}} career, Gabor {{was known for}} her extravagant Hollywood lifestyle, her glamorous personality, and her many marriages. [...] In total, Gabor had nine husbands, {{including}} hotel magnate Conrad Hilton and actor George Sanders. She once stated, [...] "Men have always liked me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> liked men. But I like a mannish man, {{a man who knows}} how to talk to and treat a womanâ€” not just a man with muscles." ...|$|E

5000|$|There {{has been}} a lot of {{discussion}} on the internet about the factors that led to Vincent leaving OCC. From the VForceCustoms website [...] "FAQ" [...] Vinnie responds to the question stating: [...] "I had gone as far as I could there. <b>I</b> really didnâ€™t <b>have</b> any chance for advancement, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> wanted to <b>have</b> my own shop, so the natural progression was to leave and start my own place.
