25|$|Due to its {{inscription}} in {{time and}} its emphasis on bodily changes (through eating, evacuation, and sex), the grotesque has been interpreted by some critics as <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> the body that permits to perceive the historicity of man: {{it is in this}} reading used as a measuring device.|$|E

25|$|In {{physics and}} mathematics, the {{dimension}} of a mathematical space (or object) is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it. Thus a line has <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> one because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on itfor example, the point at 5 on a number line. A surface such as a plane or {{the surface of a}} cylinder or sphere has <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> two because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on itfor example, both a latitude and longitude are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. The inside of a cube, a cylinder or a sphere is three-dimensional because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces.|$|E
25|$|Whut? Thee Album is {{the debut}} studio album by American rapper Redman; it was {{released}} on September 22, 1992 by Def Jam Recordings and Chaos Recordings, <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> Columbia Records. While taking place at Ian London Studios, North Shore Soundworks and Power Play Studios, recording sessions began in 1991 and continued into 1992. The album heavily features production from mentor and fellow Hit Squad member Erick Sermon, as well as Redman himself under his birth name, with additional production from Pete Rock.|$|E
25|$|The {{highlighting}} of {{the fact}} that corporeity intrinsically has <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> expressivity which proves to be fundamental to the constitution of the ego is one of the conclusions of The Structure of Behavior that is constantly reiterated in Merleau-Ponty's later works. Following this theme of expressivity, he goes on to examine how an incarnate subject {{is in a position to}} undertake actions that transcend the organic level of the body, such as in intellectual operations and the products of one's cultural life.|$|E

25|$|Attributional style (or {{explanatory}} style) is {{a concept}} introduced by Lyn Yvonne Abramson, Martin Seligman and John D. Teasdale. This concept advances a stage further than Weiner, stating {{that in addition to}} the concepts of internality-externality and stability <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> globality-specificity is also needed. Abramson et al. believed that how people explained successes and failures in their lives related to whether they attributed these to internal or external factors, short-term or long-term factors, and factors that affected all situations.|$|E
25|$|During {{the attack}} on Themyscira, the witch Circe showed her true colors and teleported the island into <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> demons in order for both tribes to be destroyed. The two tribes put aside their rivalry {{temporarily}} and fought the demons {{in order to ensure}} the Amazon survival. Though only a few months passed in the real world, the time the Amazons spent in the demon dimension lasted ten years. Discovering that Circe had made her island home disappear, Wonder Woman forced her to return it to its rightful place. Once this was done Wonder Woman learned about the invasion, the demon war, and the Amazon truce. She eventually met Artemis who was now in her mid-20s. The two got off to a rocky start but Diana could see that Artemis' heart was true.|$|E
25|$|Going {{in another}} direction, {{numerous}} links and overlaps {{have been found}} between major depressive disorder and bipolar syndromes, including mixed states (simultaneous depression and mania or hypomania). Hypomanic ('below manic') and more rarely manic signs and symptoms {{have been found in}} a significant number of cases of major depressive disorder, suggesting not a categorical distinction but <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> frequency which is higher in bipolar II and higher again in bipolar I. In addition, numerous subtypes of bipolar have been proposed beyond the types already in the DSM (which includes a milder form called cyclothymia). These extra subgroups have been defined in terms of more detailed gradations of mood severity, or the rapidity of cycling, or the extent or nature of psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, due to shared characteristics between some types of Bipolar disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder, some researchers have suggested they may both lie on a spectrum of affective disorders, although others see more links to post-trauma syndromes.|$|E

500|$|Some {{commentators}} have noted possible religious {{themes in the}} film. For instance, Fr. Robert Barron in The Catholic Register summarizes the tension between Gravitys technology and religious symbolism. He said, [...] "The technology which this film legitimately celebrates... can't save us, and it can't provide {{the means by which}} we establish real contact with each other. The Ganges in the sun, the St. Christopher icon, the statue of Budai, and above all, a visit from a denizen of heaven, signal that there is <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> reality that lies beyond what technology can master or access...the reality of God".|$|E
500|$|The Herald Tribune {{always had}} {{at least a dozen}} correspondents in the field, the most famous of whom was Homer Bigart. [...] Allowing wire {{services}} to write [...] "big picture" [...] stories, Bigart—who covered the Anzio Campaign, the Battle of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa—focused instead on writing about tactical operations conducted by small units and individual soldiers, in order to [...] "bring <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> reality and understanding to readers back home". [...] Frequently risking his life to get the stories, Bigart was highly valued by his peers and the military, and won the 1945 Pulitzer Prize.|$|E

[...] He adds <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> environmental psychology by assigning psychological profiles to urban regions according to the dominant personality traits {{of the people who}} live there. For example, the New York metropolitan area and the ChiPitts area have the highest concentration in the United States of people whose dominant personality trait is neuroticism. The book ends with a ten step guide to choosing a location best suited to the reader's personality and life situation.|$|E

500|$|The 1989 album Lukather {{came about}} after Toto had been {{recording}} and playing for 11years, and the consensus among {{the band members}} was to take a break. As Lukather had written a number of songs that did not appear on Toto albums, he decided to pursue a solo album, {{with the intention of}} presenting <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> his music that fans would be unfamiliar with. He collaborated with many notable musicians, including Eddie Van Halen, Richard Marx, Jan Hammer, Steve Stevens, and fellow Toto members Jeff Porcaro and David Paich. Lukather has said that the album was produced very simply, and that a lot of ambient studio noise—counting off on various tracks, for instance—is audible on it. He also credits bands Pink Floyd, Cream, Led Zeppelin, and guitarists Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour, Jeff Beck, and Eric Clapton as influences on the album. The single [...] "Swear Your Love" [...] came from the album.|$|E

On 15 May 2012, English club Chelsea was joined by international development manager Ian Woodroffe, and Adrian New, managing director for Asia, arrived {{in the country to}} formally launched a football school at the SM Mall of Asia. [...] It is the third football school created by Chelsea in Asia, after two others in Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur. The school is operated by Phil Younghusband and James Younghusband, brothers and former members of Chelsea's Reserves and Youth Team. After a year, Smart Communications sponsored the soccer school through its partnership with the Younghusband Football Academy (TYFA) to visit schools throughout the Philippines in conjunction with Smart's program. Soon after its establishment, they built an artificial grass football field named as Gatorade-Chelsea Blue Pitch in Ayala Alabang. The opening ceremonies was joined with Ayala Corporation president, Fernando Zobel de Ayala, Makati mayor Jun Binay and Makati representative Monique Lagdameo last 15 January 2014.

500|$|The first {{dimension}} {{visited by}} the Avatar is a prison tower in [...] "Fyrna", {{which has been}} conquered by goblins led by the Guardian. There, the player rescues a human resistance leader named Bishop, who then returns to lead a rebellion against the Guardian. Back at the castle, the player gives a small blackrock gem obtained in the prison tower to Nystul, who enchants it to disrupt the portal in the sewers. Next, the player visits Killorn Keep, a floating fortress in a different dimension. Altara, a sorceress in Killorn Keep who is allied with Bishop, warns the Avatar that the Guardian has hidden a magical spy beneath the castle in Britannia. She provides a special dagger with which to kill it. After removing the spy, the Avatar visits <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> ice caves: {{the remnants of a}} civilization destroyed by the Guardian, now ruled by a ghost named Beatrice. The Avatar returns to the castle and finds that Lady Tory has been murdered by the traitor. The next dimension is Talorus, a world inhabited by energy beings called [...] "Talorids" [...] that each serve a single purpose, such as knowing only the past or producing runestones. Talorids are created to serve the Guardian, but the Avatar destroys and replaces the sole reproductive Talorid to free the race.|$|E

500|$|The Cerro Blanco {{complex is}} formed from {{pyroclastic}} flows extending from nested calderas. The Robledo caldera is heavily eroded and has assumed a semicircular shape. The {{rim of the}} Cerro Blanco caldera proper is well-preserved, with ash and block flows filling the interior. Another theory holds that the northern Cerro Blanco and the southern Robledo calderas are part of one caldera with a minimum subsidence of [...] and <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> [...] The Cerro Blanco caldera is [...] wide. On its southern rim, surrounded by ashfall deposits, lies the Holocene Cerro Blanco del Robledo lava dome (...) [...] Some sources call the whole volcano Robledo and use Cerro Blanco {{to refer to the}} lava dome. The whole volcanic complex is formed from lava domes, ignimbrites, ash and block flows and unconsolidated deposits. Cerro Blanco is the largest lava dome and has a debris collapse deposit on its northern side. A hydrothermally altered area {{in the middle of the}} caldera has been linked to phreatomagmatic activity. The El Escondido crater northeast of the caldera is [...] wide and [...] deep. It shows a dark colour and semiannular shape in satellite images and has been interpreted as a phreatic crater. The complex is located at the southwest end of a volcano-tectonic depression formed by local fault systems. These fault systems channel magma during eruptions; usually no eruption column is formed. The formation of the depression may be influenced by the emptying of magma chambers associated with the volcano. The complex is located on [...] thick crust. A crustal low seismic velocity anomaly is located beneath Cerro Blanco, called the Southern Puna Magma Body.|$|E
