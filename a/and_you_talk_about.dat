6000|$|Godfrey {{gazed at}} her; he listened with parted lips, incredulous and appalled. [...] "You invented such a tissue of falsities and calumnies, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> your conscience? You stand there in your senses and {{proclaim}} your crime?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew it {{had been}} rankling in your mind all along," [...] said the girl [...] "I {{expected}} it to coma out sooner or later. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> renunciation! You never forget nor forgive the slightest thing. But I don't ask your forgiveness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An excuse?" [...] I said. [...] "An excuse? What the deuce are {{you talking}} about, McPherson? You see me trudging about all day at my practise, when I'm not looking after the prisoners, and coming back every night as tired as a dog, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> finding an excuse for doing more work." ...|$|E
60|$|CLEOPATRA (coaxing). No: I {{want to stay}} <b>and</b> hear <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Mark Antony.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] said Jude hastily. [...] "I don't {{want to be}} {{reminded}} of those things; <b>and</b> if <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> them I shall not help you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nonsense! It {{reflects}} the highest credit on your philanthropic spirit, Hughie. And don't run away. Have another cigarette, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> can <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Laura {{as much as}} you like.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense. I'd {{take all}} the boils {{on the market in}} {{exchange}} for my troubles. Can't you realize the position? I've lost the best cook to England. My husband, poor soul, will probably die of dyspepsia. And my only daughter, for whom I had dreamed such a wonderful future, is engaged to be married to an inebriated newt fancier. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> boils!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I feel {{as though}} this were some sort of nightmare," [...] he muttered. [...] "I've known you for several months, Mr. Lutchester, and I have never heard you say a serious word. You dance at Henry's; you made a good soldier, they said, but you'd had enough of it in twelve months; you play auction bridge in the afternoons; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the war {{as though it were}} simply an irritating circumstance. And to-night--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A hundred a year!" [...] ejaculated the archdeacon militant, {{defying the}} impudence of these claimants {{with one hand}} {{stretched}} out and closed, while with the other he tightly grasped, and secured within his breeches pocket, that symbol of the church's wealth which his own loose half-crowns not unaptly represented. [...] "A hundred a year! Why, my men, you must be mad; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> John Hiram's will! When John Hiram built a hospital for worn-out old men, worn-out old labouring men, infirm old men past their work, cripples, blind, bed-ridden, and such like, {{do you think he}} meant to make gentlemen of them? Do you think John Hiram intended to give a hundred a year to old single men, who earned perhaps two shillings or half-a-crown a day for themselves and families in the best of their time? No, my men, I'll tell you what John Hiram meant: he meant that twelve poor old worn-out labourers, men who could no longer support themselves, who had no friends to support them, who must starve and perish miserably if not protected by the hand of charity;--he meant that twelve such men as these should come in here in their poverty and wretchedness, and find within these walls shelter and food before their death, and a little leisure to make their peace with God. That was what John Hiram meant: you have not read John Hiram's will, and I doubt whether those wicked men who are advising you have done so. I have; I know what his will was; and I tell you that that was his will, and that that was his intention." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; that's another word. But you can't get any farther. God made electricity, or {{whatever}} it is, <b>and</b> when <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> explaining it, <b>you</b> only get to something that is. You know it is, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> can't get any farther,' he repeated.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should like}} to know how--how my mother and Miss Maylie are,' said the young man; 'and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks <b>you</b> take, <b>and</b> what <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> <b>and</b> whether she--they, I mean--seem happy <b>and</b> quite well. <b>You</b> {{understand}} me?' ...|$|R
60|$|MITCHENER. Man; {{can you not}} be serious? Here are we, face to {{face with}} Lady Richmond's grave displeasure; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> to me <b>about</b> gas and subscriptions. Her own nephew.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad it {{was only}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> the doctor that saw my foolishness," [...] {{continued}} the other, still in a low voice. [...] "Other people might have talked, but I knew {{that you were a}} reliable man, Smith. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> won't <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it in the future, I'm quite certain of that. Good afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He lied," [...] said Edith. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it together, {{we should}} tell the simple truth. We have pardoned him his lie;--but he lied." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What were <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Violet <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> so eagerly?" [...] said Lady Laura to him, {{with a smile}} that, in its {{approach}} to laughter, almost betrayed its mistress.|$|R
2500|$|To {{promote his}} film The Love Letter, Selleck {{was invited to}} be on The Rosie O'Donnell Show on May 19, 1999. Unexpectedly, he found himself {{defending}} an ad in which he appeared supporting the National Rifle Association (NRA) and his position on gun ownership. After questions from O'Donnell, Selleck said, [...] "It's your show, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> can <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it after I leave." ...|$|R
5000|$|Keith Kizer {{publicly}} {{responded to}} Sonnen's testimony, claiming the NSAC had never approved Sonnen for TRT, Sonnen had never {{applied for the}} approval process, and he had [...] "never talked to Chael Sonnen in his life." [...] At a subsequent meeting between the UFC, Sonnen and the NSAC, Kizer asked Sonnen about his testimony at the December 2, 2010, CSAC hearing. According to Kizer, Sonnen initially deflected his questions but, when pressed further, admitted no conversation between Kizer and himself had occurred. Sonnen explained [...] "My manager <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> therapeutic exemptions, <b>and</b> therefore, I just used the wrong word. I should have said 'my' instead of 'I.' As in 'my manager' instead of 'I'". Kizer called this a [...] "strange story" [...] and a [...] "ridiculous explanation" [...] Kizer acknowledged speaking with Sonnen's manager (Matt Lindland) about TRT, but said the conversation concerned only the procedure itself, not the application of any particular fighter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yesterday, master, <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> this Master-maid, <b>and</b> to-day <b>you</b> are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> her; ah, heaven bless you, master, why {{will you}} not {{show me the}} thing? for {{it would be a}} real {{pleasure}} to me to see it," [...] said the Prince, who again pretended to be silly and stupid.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} it {{altogether}} wrong and monstrous!" [...] the squire exclaimed hotly. [...] "You have been virtually the child's father, {{for the last}} seven years. You have cared for her, and loved her, and worked for her. She is everything to <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> I feel how vast are your claims to her, compared to mine; <b>and</b> now <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> going away, <b>and</b> coming to see her once every three months. The idea is unnatural. It is downright monstrous! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tut! Let us {{have done}} with that. WE know very well how it was. Why should <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it, when <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I can't {{disguise}} it? To proceed. I am disappointed and cut a poor figure.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How--wherefore--what dost thou mean?" [...] {{said the}} monk, in astonishment. [...] "I speak to thee of Rose Flammock, and Jan Van- devil, or {{whatever}} <b>you</b> call him, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> reply with <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> cattle and castles, and I wot not what!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They do {{not differ}} from other rocks, as far as I can see. They are very rugged and very rough, and would be very awkward if they lay out at sea instead of in this little bay, where they are in nobody's way. Is it not enough that you have tramped two miles {{to have a look}} at them, which means four miles, as we have got to return somehow? <b>And</b> now <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> {{climbing}} down that break-neck cliff {{to have a look at}} them close!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Dorian {{looked at}} him and smiled. [...] "What a way for a fashionable painter to travel! A Gladstone bag, and an ulster! Come in, or the fog will get into the house. <b>And</b> mind <b>you</b> don't <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> {{anything}} serious. Nothing is serious nowadays. At least nothing should be." ...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{troublesome}} {{that there}} was a mass exodus, especially families. <b>And</b> when <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> families, <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> children. They were getting slaughtered in the freeways. The children don’t know what’s happening and why they are there. Andwhy their parents are doing it. They just know this is not their home. The sign conveys that they are away from home. And the children are asking, ‘What are we running for?’ Today, even when I watch parents walking in malls with their kids, it’s like they are dragging them. That was the idea: clutching something that is dear to our heart. John Hood, Caltrans graphic artist ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} not," [...] Matteo said. [...] "I had never dreamt of {{doing more than}} {{recovering}} the Pluto, <b>and</b> when <b>you</b> first <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> that, it seemed almost like madness. I don't think one of us had the slightest belief {{in the possibility of}} the thing, when you first proposed it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And instead, {{you have}} driven through the town, I suppose, where {{everybody}} will see <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it. But," [...] she added, raising {{her dark eyes}} suddenly to his, [...] "where else have you been? The train gets into Warensboro at six, and it's only half an hour's drive from there. What have you been doing, Edward?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The case {{never needed}} to be fixed up this way, Tom," [...] said Longley. [...] "I saw Cooper this evening, {{and he told me}} what <b>you</b> <b>and</b> him <b>talked</b> <b>about.</b> Then I went down to your house to-night <b>and</b> saw <b>you</b> come out with your guns on, <b>and</b> I {{followed}} <b>you.</b> Let's go back, Tom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Man, {{what would}} you have done? Of course, I fell to it. <b>And,</b> to tell <b>you</b> the truth, I began to like old Maggie. It wasn't all on account of the forty {{millions}} and what she could do for me. I was kind of lonesome in the world too. Everybody's got to have somebody they can explain to about the pain in their left shoulder and how fast patent-leather shoes wear out when they begin to crack. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> can't <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> such things to men you meet in hotels--they're looking for just such openings.|$|R
5000|$|Again, one of {{the great}} {{problems}} in the commission report is that it looked at exactly one issue — counterterrorism — and n{{one of the}} others. But U.S. intelligence users consist of more than one million people, many of them in uniform, <b>and</b> when <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> budgeting <b>and</b> programming authority, <b>you</b> have to consider that[...] [...] [...] Many of these conclusions are probably very valuable. But this is a 13-chapter report. Eleven chapters are a masterful description of what happened and what went wrong that led to the 9/11 attack. There is no chapter that explains what people did after 9/11. There is no chapter that qualifies that this {{is only one of many}} problems in intelligence and intelligence reform." ...|$|R
60|$|You can't {{conceive}} of the intense interest which is reigning here, you can't realise it, scarcely. In Paris there is vivid interest, of course, but that is from less immediate motives, except with persons who have relations in the army. Here {{it is as if}} each one had a personal enemy in the street below struggling to get up to him. When we are anxious we are pale; when we are glad we have tears in our eyes. This 'unnecessary' and 'inexcusable' war (as it has been called in England) represents the only hope of a nation agonising between death <b>and</b> life. <b>You</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> our living or dying, but we live or die. That's the difference between <b>you</b> <b>and</b> us.|$|R
60|$|L. You don't {{seem to me}} to know in {{the least}} what you do mean, children. What {{practical}} difference is there between 'that,' <b>and</b> what <b>you</b> are <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> The Samaritan children had no voice of their own in the business, it is true; but neither had Iphigenia: the Greek girl was certainly neither boiled, nor eaten; but that only makes a difference in the dramatic effect; not in the principle.|$|R
5000|$|Amonkar was {{recognised}} {{by several}} of her contemporaries and fellow musicians for her skill and technique in classical music. The tabla musician, Ustad Zakir Hussain, has said that Amonkar's performances of several ragas, such as Raga Bhoop, are [...] "... landmark performances that take place over hundreds of years <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> them {{for the rest of}} your life and rest of the many centuries to come." [...] The Carnatic vocalist T.M. Krishna praised her approach to classical music, saying, [...] "When Kishoriji sings she is not trying to be new but just by being with her music and continuing to submit to it, she has given classical music an everlasting newness and freshness. This is true creativity." ...|$|R
40|$|Performance Paradigm: At the Australasian Association for Theatre, Drama and Performance (ADSA) {{conference in}} 2006 <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> {{the need for}} {{practitioners}} (and theorists?) to ‘stop fetishising the metaphysics of impermanence’ and to locate discussion in a ‘more political realm’. You also stated that you felt we needed to ‘seek answers from elsewhere’ rather than from theatre, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> proceeded to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> your recent work in South Africa with HIV/AIDS sufferers.

6000|$|He {{gazed at}} me, open-mouthed. 'What? Put my {{foot in it}} again?' he interposed. 'Not high-toned enough? Eh? Now, I do regret it. No offence meant, miss, nor none need be taken. What I meant to in-sinuate was this: you hev won the big race for me. Folks will notice <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> at Frankfort.

6000|$|... "Listen, Henry. Generally, I don't like schoolboys. I {{have a great}} {{horror of}} them. They seem to me little ruffians, who take an unnatural delight in killing and tormenting birds, and insects, and kittens, and {{whatever}} is weaker than themselves.
