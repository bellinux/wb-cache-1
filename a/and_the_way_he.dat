5|$|Milan Pořádek, the fan whom Blythe {{admitted}} to shoving off the stage, testified {{on the third}} day of the trial. Pořádek said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive; he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage. Pořádek testified that Blythe knocked him down, knelt on him and held him down for a moment, but Blythe definitely did not choke him. He also admitted that taking into account the fact that he (Pořádek) was drunk <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> acted, Blythe's reaction was adequate. He commented that he grasped {{the fact that he was}} not wanted on stage.|$|E
5|$|Kanye West {{began working}} on Graduation {{immediately}} after releasing his second studio album Late Registration. By late September 2005, West had already completed three songs for the album, which he intended to contain a total of twelve tracks. Around {{the time of the}} recording of the third studio album, West would often listen to songs written by folk and country singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his word play and storytelling abilities. The former musician had been recommended to West by multiple of his friends, including English disc jockey Samantha Ronson, all of whom claimed his music <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> dealt with the press reminded them of Dylan. Kanye also listened to his most favorite alternative rock bands, including The Killers, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, and Keane, in order to gain new ideas on how to make his hip-hop production style more stadium-friendly. Additionally, West would often test his new songs on his iPod, in his office, in dance clubs and just about anywhere people might listen to his music. He would then make adjustments to the tracks based on feedback he received, repeating the process as many times as necessary.|$|E

He coined the terms peak (or maximal) metabolism and metabolic quotient which entered the textbooks on the subject.|$|E

His style was naïve and representational, featuring local scenes of ceremonies, games, social gatherings, and home life that he was familiar with and often participated in. His style recalled Plains flatstyle representative art that often identified individuals by depicting details of dress and accoutrement, but he took the representational depiction of the figures and setting {{in a new direction}} that was uniquely his own.|$|E
25|$|Šarūnas {{started going}} to school in Jonas Jablonskis Middle School in 1982 and {{attended}} it till 1987. He {{had to take the}} bus to go to school even though the thermometer outside read minus twenty and he knew {{that the most important thing}} for his parents was that he spent as little time as possible with the toughest people of Partizanai Street. From 1987 to 1993, he was studying at Kaunas 4th Middle School. His first trip destination was Moscow, which he visited before the tournament. Jasikevičius's greatest youth memory in the city was the opening of the first McDonald's in Russia. He remembers that his classmates were listening with their mouths gaping when he was narrating about the French fries, bread rolls with minced beef and fizzy drinks. One of his childhood passions was history, especially about the Native Americans, as well as books about basketball as he was capable of reading a book of more than four hundred pages on basketball in two days. He was also curious about politics, especially when Perestroika began, because of which he was able to travel to Berlin with his father and brother, and was amazed by the visit to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. His childhood favorite Lithuanian player was Arvydas Sabonis, which he admired more than other Lithuanian superstars, such as Rimas Kurtinaitis and Valdemaras Chomičius, due to his passing. However, his idol was Dražen Petrović, and he wished to be as good as him, watching matches of him over and over again, dozens of times, for hours and hours, and later started imitating him in workouts. After one of his trips, his dad came back with a videocassette recorder, using which he was able to record an NBA All-Star Game with Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, David Robinson, and later to watch it for couple of years, more than hundred times. Jasikevičius also started to record games of Žalgiris and Petrović every time he was able to. Thanks to the video recorder, he discovered the existence of a no-look pass of Magic Johnson. For him, he was the NBA, not Michael Jordan. His unselfishness, imagination <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> dribbled, passed between his opponent's legs bewitched Jasikevičius. Consequently, his favorite element of basketball quickly became assisting his teammates, and he was trying to do it like Petrović or Johnson.|$|E

500|$|Girl with Ball is {{described}} by Diane Waldman as [...] "striking" [...] in the simple and bold way it presents a vacation atmosphere.

In contrast, Fielding noted that within the NF of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Tyndall's standing among [...] "ordinary members" [...] was [...] "very high", {{with some of them}} even chanting his name during his speeches. Tyndall lived a life of temperance and regular exercise, and—according to Walker—his early morning runs had [...] "long been a joke in Nationalist circles".|$|E

[...] "The people that Shane loved more {{than anyone else in the}} world before the apocalypse are still very much alive and still very much with him, but he'll never be with them in the way he wants to <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> once was.

This was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure Glover an audition for the lead role in the 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man.

[...] She was pleased with the emphasis on Jim <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> [...] "wonderfully bookended the conflicting emotions Michael inspires." [...] West also believed that the [...] "writers did a great job of creating the sense of crisis that resulted in the Scranton branch instead absorbing Stamford (I never trusted that Josh guy) even though fans of the original {{knew it was going to}} end up that way."

500|$|In 1986, John Mortimer, {{a writer}} whom Hordern {{respected}} greatly, engaged the actor in Paradise Postponed, an eleven-part drama which {{took a year}} to make and cost in excess of £6 million. Set in rural England, the saga depicts the struggles within British middle-class society during the post-war years. In his biography, Hordern described himself as [...] "a man of prejudice rather than principle" [...] and as such, had very {{little in common with}} his character, the left-wing, Marxist-loving vicar, Simeon Simcox. [...] Despite the political differences, Hordern felt great empathy towards his character, and admired his [...] "plain, straightforward attitude to life, his dottiness, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> hung to his faith in a wicked world with a saintliness verging on the simple".|$|E

Otherwise, too much has to depend on her youth, innocence, and beauty. She had one good speech to win the audience, but it was cut.

Veteran manager Dave Bassett, a friend of Allardyce, once humorously remarked that [...] "He was what I called a ball-playing defender... If he wasn't playing with the ball he was playing with your balls." [...] He was uncomfortable in possession, and played simple balls to his nearest teammates when he found himself with the ball, whilst teammates would be reluctant to pass to him. He did however possess good awareness and heading skills, and his anticipation made up for his lack of pace.|$|E
500|$|The Bermúdez {{album was}} {{borrowed}} by the Academy for the 1863 edition. The original titles or captions were etched onto the plates, even with Goya's spelling mistakes. One title was changed, one plate had work added, and the printing {{was carried out}} with much more ink on the plates (producing [...] "surface tone") than in the proofs, in accordance with mid-century taste. The Bermúdez set is considered [...] "uniquely important... because it shows the series as Goya must have intended to publish it, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> intended the plates to be printed". There is therefore {{a distinction between the}} published edition of 1863, with 80 plates, and the full series in the album, which contains 82 (ignoring the three small Prisioneros).|$|E
500|$|Besides his style, Cicero also admired {{other aspects}} of Demosthenes's works, such as the good prose rhythm, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> {{structured}} and arranged the material in his orations. According to the Roman statesman, Demosthenes regarded [...] "delivery" [...] (gestures, voice etc.) as more important than style. Although he lacked Aeschines's charming voice and Demades's skill at improvisation, he made efficient use of his body to accentuate his words. Thus he managed to project his ideas and arguments much more forcefully. However, the use of physical gestures wasn't an integral or developed part of rhetorical training in his day. Moreover, his delivery was not accepted by everybody in antiquity: Demetrius Phalereus and the comedians ridiculed Demosthenes's [...] "theatricality", whilst Aeschines regarded Leodamas of Acharnae as superior to him.|$|E

500|$|Program music came {{naturally}} to Rimsky-Korsakov. To him, [...] "even a folk theme has {{a program of}} sorts." [...] He composed {{the majority of his}} orchestral works in this genre at two periods of his career—at the beginning, with Sadko and Antar (also known as his Second Symphony, Op. 9), and in the 1880s, with Scheherezade, Capriccio Espagnol and the Russian Easter Overture. Despite the gap between these two periods, the composer's overall approach <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> used his musical themes remained consistent. Both Antar and Scheherezade use a robust [...] "Russian" [...] theme to portray the male progagonists (the title character in Antar; the sultan in Scheherezade) and a more sinuous [...] "Eastern" [...] theme for the female ones (the peri Gul-Nazar in Antar and the title character in Scheherezade).|$|E
500|$|Parker and Stone said {{a number}} of Cartman's {{characteristics}} which have endured throughout the South Park series started in [...] "Damien". Specifically, his voice took on a higher-pitch that was more nasally and whiney than in previous episodes; Stone {{described it as a}} [...] "self-indulgent accent". Some of his regular vocal mannerisms were also developed in the episode, including his use of the sound [...] "Nyah" [...] while saying the word [...] "Here", <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> says [...] "Hey you guuuuuuys" [...] while talking to his friends. Parker, who provides the voice of Cartman, said the characteristics came about naturally while filming the episode: [...] "This show for some reason, for whatever reason, maybe I just lost interest, but I was trying all these messed up things with him and all these things sort of stuck." ...|$|E

Upon Pogba's departure from Juventus in 2016, his former teammate Gianluigi Buffon compared him to French former playmakers Michel Platini and Zinedine Zidane, and also praised his ability, leadership, work-rate and attitude, both on the pitch and in training, stating that he [...] "..is a tremendous warrior on the pitch but also has so much talent.
