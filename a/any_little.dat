500|$|As {{production}} continued, Tom Hall {{dubbed the}} game's scripting language [...] "APE" [...] (Anachronox Programming Language). Hall explained, [...] "I call it my new Apple II because it's {{so much fun}} to program in and it takes all the drudgery out of it. It's sort of if you mushed together C, Basic and Java in a way—for programming people it's sort of Windows based. It began as a defined dialogue window, but provided variables so that you could position and move a picture. So from there it grew like UNIX with little bits and pieces, and you have things that initialize data to the window, things that constantly update the window, and things that happen after the window, in little code chunks and with that you can do <b>any</b> <b>little</b> thing." [...] Hall wrote and coded the mini-game Bugaboo for Anachronox in 15 hours to demonstrate the environment's simplicity. Other tools developed for the game were B.E.D. (a battle editor), ION Radiant (for level design, based on QERadiant), NoxDrop (for item and character placement), and Planet (a spline-based camera system coded by Joey Liaw). Ion Storm worked with QuakeEd developer Robert Duffy to create QERadiant, later adapted to ION Radiant. Hall lauded Planet: [...] "you can control entities on paths, trigger events, manipulate particles, and do just about anything you please. One of the more common team beliefs is that the only true limit to Planet is the person controlling it." [...] Hall aimed to provide several end-user modification tools, such as one to allow gamers to create their own MysTech elements. Other programs would allow implementation of new dialogue, voice-acting, and camera work. Ion Storm developed tutorials and documentation for each tool.|$|E

Andrews made her professional solo debut at the London Hippodrome singing the difficult aria [...] "Je suis Titania" [...] from Mignon {{as part of a}} musical revue called [...] "Starlight Roof" [...] on 22 October 1947. She played the Hippodrome for one year. Andrews recalled: [...] "Starlight Roof" [...] saying, [...] "There was this wonderful American person and comedian, Wally Boag, who made balloon animals. He would say, 'Is there <b>any</b> <b>little</b> girl or boy in the audience who would like one of these?' And I would rush up onstage and say, 'I'd like one, please.' And then he would chat to me and I'd tell him I sang... I was fortunate in that I absolutely stopped the show cold. I mean, the audience went crazy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many reformers – Galbraith is {{not alone}} in this – have as their basic {{objection}} to a free market that it frustrates them in achieving their reforms, because it enables people to have what they want, not what the reformers want. Hence every reformer has a strong tendency to be averse to a free market.Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Solow, in a review of The New Industrial State, points at Galbraith's lack for empiricism and selectiveness in the his use of evidence. He points out that [...] "It may be unjust and pointless to consider the degree of literal truth of each of the assertions that make up this argument. One would hardly discuss Gulliver's Travels by debating whether there really are <b>any</b> <b>little</b> people, or criticize the Grande Jatte because objects aren't made up of tiny dots. Nevertheless, it may help to judge the truth of Galbraith's." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{week after}} the engagement, the {{proposed}} Anglo-Russo alliance experienced its first crisis. Queen Victoria asked the Tsar to bring Maria to Scotland, {{so that she could}} meet her future daughter-in-law. Alexander II refused. The Tsarina suggested that they all meet in Cologne, instead. The Queen called it [...] "simply impertinent" [...] that [...] "I ... who have been nearly twenty years longer on the throne than the Emperor of Russia ... and who am a Reigning Sovereign ... should be ready to run to the slightest call of the mighty Russians ... like <b>any</b> <b>little</b> Princess." [...] Victoria also made herself unpopular by refusing the Tsar’s offer to make the Prince of Wales colonel of a Russian regiment, and by demanding that an Anglican marriage service be held in St Petersburg alongside the Orthodox ceremony. But Maria Alexandrovna looked forward happily to her marriage: [...] "How happy I am to belong to him. I feel that my love for him is growing daily.

2500|$|Other {{moments in}} the series suggest that other Time Lords have {{more control over their}} {{regeneration}} than that usually displayed by the Doctor. Prior to regenerating in the episode [...] "Utopia", the Master expresses a desire to be [...] "young and strong" [...] like the Doctor and transforms accordingly. Subsequently, in [...] "Last of the Time Lords", the Master is shot by Lucy Saxon and is able to prevent regeneration at will, despite the Doctor's pleas. In [...] "The Stolen Earth," [...] the Doctor begins to regenerate in a cliffhanger moment, but at the start of [...] "Journey's End" [...] (the following episode), he interrupts the process after healing his bodily injuries, redirecting the remaining regeneration energy into his preserved hand. In [...] "Let's Kill Hitler", when Mels begins to regenerate into River Song, she says she is trying to concentrate so she can come out a particular dress size. In [...] "Nightmare in Silver", the Eleventh Doctor suggests that he can trigger regeneration voluntarily, using the suggestion to threaten the Cyber-Planner invading his body and mind, saying [...] "I could regenerate now. Big blast of regeneration energy, burn out <b>any</b> <b>little</b> Cyber widgets in my brain, along with everything you're connected to. Don't want to. Use this me up, who knows what we'll get next? But I can." [...] (Even though by The Time Of The Doctor this was revealed to be a bluff {{due to the fact that}} the Eleventh Doctor was actually the final incarnation of his first regeneration cycle.) In [...] "The Girl Who Died, the Twelfth Doctor speculates that he deliberately, if not subconsciously, chose the form of Caecilius (from [...] "The Fires of Pompeii") to remind himself that he is a man who always saves people, even if it is just one. In [...] "The Doctor Falls", the Doctor is wounded by Cybermen and starts to regenerate, but is able to hold back his regeneration, refusing to change again.|$|E
