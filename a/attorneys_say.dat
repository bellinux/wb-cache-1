50|$|Following Turner's {{sentencing}} in 2016, the plaintiff's {{attorneys in}} the De Anza case criticized Persky for allowing the photos into evidence. Attorneys for Doe said the photographs {{were not the}} only evidence that Persky unfairly permitted. Four of the baseball players had invoked Fifth Amendment rights not to self-incriminate during the discovery phase of the litigation. According to a lawyer for Doe, that was a critical juncture: it prevented their team from obtaining evidence that could have helped them pursue their case. The original judge in the case ruled in 2010 that the defendants could refuse to testify, but that would also mean that they would be prohibited from subsequently testifying in the case. That ruling was, however, overturned by Persky after he took over the trial in 2011, a move that Doe's <b>attorneys</b> <b>say</b> undermined her case.|$|E

50|$|The {{regulation}} {{was strongly}} supported by Mayor Michael Bloomberg {{and continues to}} be supported by his successor, Mayor Bill de Blasio. Approximately 32,000 written and oral comments were received in support of the proposal and approximately 6,000 comments were received in opposition. Opponents include beverage companies such as PepsiCo and their independent bottlers and distributors serving the city, which have launched campaigns against the limit.
