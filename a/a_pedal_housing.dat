50|$|In small combo jazz or jazz fusion groups, {{the double}} bass player or Hammond organist may also {{introduce}} <b>a</b> <b>pedal</b> point (usually on the tonic or the dominant) in a tune {{that does not}} explicitly request <b>a</b> <b>pedal</b> point, to add tension and interest. Thrash metal in particular makes abundant use a muted low E string (or lower, if other tunings are used) as <b>a</b> <b>pedal</b> point.|$|R

An internal <b>pedal</b> is <b>a</b> <b>pedal</b> that is similar to the inverted pedal, except that it is played in the middle register between the bass and the upper voices.|$|R

50|$|Pedal {{points are}} {{somewhat}} problematic on the harpsichord, which {{has only a}} limited sustain capability. Often the pedal note is simply repeated at intervals. <b>A</b> <b>pedal</b> tone can also be realized with a trill; this is particularly common with inverted pedals. Another method of producing <b>a</b> <b>pedal</b> point on the harpsichord is to repeat the pedal point note (or its octave) on every beat. The rarely seen <b>pedal</b> harpsichord, <b>a</b> harpsichord with <b>a</b> <b>pedal</b> keyboard, {{makes it easier to}} perform repeated bass notes on the harpsichord, since both hands are still free to play on the upper manual keyboards.|$|R

50|$|The main {{difference}} between {{the different types of}} footmice is <b>a</b> flat <b>pedal</b> which slides or <b>a</b> <b>pedal</b> which tilts. There also exists a mouse adapter which converts a conventional mouse to a footmouse that slides and horizontally tilts to one side. A footmouse that uses sliding can be a slipper with a mouse connected to it, or a special frame in which <b>a</b> <b>pedal</b> can move around. Also a tiny magnet or other location device can be used on a tablet. A footmouse that uses <b>a</b> tilting <b>pedal</b> has one or two pedals which are able to tilt and turn in one or more directions. Buttons that are pushed by the feet are not considered footmice.|$|R
