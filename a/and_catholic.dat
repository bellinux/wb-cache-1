Like Anglicans <b>and</b> <b>Catholics,</b> Buddhists preferred introversion (I). Like Anglicans who preferred intuition (N) <b>and</b> unlike <b>Catholics</b> who preferred sensing (S), Buddhists displayed a preference for intuition (N). Unlike Anglicans <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> who both preferred feeling (F), Buddhists displayed a balance between feeling (F) and thinking (T). Like Anglicans <b>and</b> unlike <b>Catholics,</b> Buddhists preferred the Apollonian temperament (NF) over the Epimethean temperament (SJ). These data are discussed to interpret the psychological appeal of New Kadampa Buddhism...|$|R
3000|$|The {{policy of}} favoritism towards Catholicism and {{discrimination}} against Buddhism caused conflict between Buddhism <b>and</b> the <b>Catholic</b> government <b>and</b> between Buddhists <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> in 1963. Buddhists organized demonstrations {{in order to}} oppose the discriminatory policy and defend its communities. Consequently, strife between lay Buddhists <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> sometimes took place. There were clashes between extremist lay Buddhists <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> at the Saigon radio station and at a newspaper building in Saigon, in Huế, Quy Nhơn, Đà Nẵng, and so on.

5|$|In {{terms of}} public policy she favoured pragmatism in dealing with {{religious}} matters. The question of her legitimacy was a key concern: although she was technically illegitimate under both Protestant <b>and</b> <b>Catholic</b> law, her retroactively declared illegitimacy under the English church was not a serious bar compared to having never been legitimate as the Catholics claimed she was. For this reason alone, it was never in serious doubt that Elizabeth would embrace Protestantism.|$|E

5|$|Andronicus' {{rule was}} marked by {{incompetence}} and short-sighted decisions {{that in the long}} run would damage the Byzantine Empire beyond repair. He began to debase the Byzantine hyperpyron, resulting in a reduction of the value of the Byzantine economy; taxes were decreased for the Powerful, i.e. landed aristocracy and instead placed upon the Knight-class Pronoia. To popularize his rule he repudiated the union of the Orthodox <b>and</b> <b>Catholic</b> Churches decreed by the Second Council of Lyon in 1274, thereby further increasing hostilities between the Latins and the Byzantines.|$|E

40|$|For many English puritans, the {{new world}} {{represented}} new opportunities for the reification of reformation, if not a site within which they might begin to experience {{the conditions of the}} millennium itself.

And yet, as the chapters in this volume demonstrate, the Atlantic experience of puritans <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> could be much less bifurcated than some of the established scholarly narratives have suggested: puritans <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> could co-exist within the same trans-Atlantic families; Catholics could prosper, just as puritans could experience financial decline; <b>and</b> <b>Catholics</b> <b>and</b> puritans could adopt, and exchange, similar kinds of belief structures and practical arrangements, even to the extent of being mistaken for each other.

5|$|Aston's {{return to}} England in late 1626, {{along with all}} the Catholic settlers, failed to deter Baltimore, who finally sailed for Newfoundland in 1627, {{arriving}} on 23 July and staying only two months before returning to England. He had taken both Protestant <b>and</b> <b>Catholic</b> settlers with him, as well as two secular priests, Thomas Longville and Anthony Pole (also known as Smith), the latter remaining behind in the colony when Baltimore departed for England. The land Baltimore had seen was by no means the paradise described by some early settlers, being only marginally productive; as the summer climate was deceptively mild, his brief visit gave Baltimore no reason to alter his plans for the colony.|$|E

This made the Western Isles the Scottish council area with the smallest percentage of atheists in the population.

5|$|During {{the late}} 16th century, {{tensions}} grew between Protestant England <b>and</b> <b>Catholic</b> Spain, leading ultimately to the undeclared Anglo-Spanish War of 1585–1604.

New fortifications were erected along the Medway, including a chain stretched across {{the width of the}} river below Upnor Castle. The castle itself was poorly manned until Lord High Admiral Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham highlighted this and recommended that the garrison should be increased. By 1596, it was garrisoned by eighty men who were each paid eight pence per day (equivalent to £6 today).|$|E
