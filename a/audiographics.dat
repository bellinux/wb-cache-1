40|$|<b>Audiographics</b> was an {{established}} educational technology {{prior to the}} development and spread of the World Wide Web (Web) in the early 1990 s. First generation <b>audiographics</b> products used bridged telephone lines (audio) and modem linked computers (graphics) to synchronously connect an instructor with groups of students. In {{the second half of}} the 1990 s the use of the Web increased dramatically and traditional <b>audiographics</b> use declined. Since the early 2000 s, and as part of the development of a second generation of Web services, Web 2. 0, a new generation of <b>audiographics</b> tools, now commonly termed collaborative or Web conferencing software, have become available. This evolution of the <b>audiographics</b> technology and its associated instructional capabilities is explored via a longitudinal case study of the use of <b>audiographics</b> in the Faculty of Business at Southern Cross University. Following a review of the first and second generation products used, we identify and show how four key lessons from the initial period of use have been addressed. We focus particularly on how the fourth lesson (flexibility of the delivery format) has been addressed and present preliminary data gathered from early student and staff adopters abou...|$|E
40|$|Traditional audiographic set-ups, using bridged {{phone lines}} (audio) and modem linked {{computers}} (graphics) were a well established educational technology just before {{and in the}} early years of the Web.

This new generation of <b>audiographics</b> relies on Internet connections and using powerful and reliable server-based platforms, offers a range of integrated instructional tools (VoIP, shared whiteboard, shared applications, video windows and archival recording) all within a single, easy to manage, Web browser window.

40|$|In this work, we {{approach}} the design, implementation and evaluation of <b>AudioGraphics,</b> a modular computer program intended to provide activities relating mathematics to music and sound. The goal in designing this program was to facilitate mathematic representation learning processes by having pupils draw coordinates on a two-axis graphic representing the variation of sound frequency thru time (pitch patterns). <b>AudioGraphics</b> was designed to pupils aged 9, 10 and 11 in Elementary Chilean Schools. To carry out this work, we followed a thre-stages method: 1) generating significative metaphores relating two-axis graphic representations and sound. 2) Development of a functional prototype with a didactic guide, that passed a usability evaluation process. 3) Assessment of <b>AudioGraphics</b> by teachers and pupils (this last shown here). Pupils’ results of assesment (N= 67) at three Chilean prioritary centres show an excelent reception of the computer program. Dimensions of evaluation –math learning, music learning, global and technical- have shown high scores. Furthermore, evaluation shows an excelent positive emotional balance: pupils felt more positive emotions than negative ones in working with the program. This could be an indicator of validation in respect of dimensions aforementioned...|$|E

Although {{much has been written about}} task design and task-based learning and teaching (TBLT) in language learning (Johnson, 2003; Klapper, 2003; Ellis, 2000; Nunan, 1989, among others), the shift to an <b>audiographic</b> Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) medium presents a number of challenges to task design which are only just beginning to be documented (Hampel 2003, Hampel & Baber 2003, Hampel & Hauck 2004). Here we will discuss what the challenges are for the design and implementation of activities suited to the development of oral skills in a foreign language in such an environment in the light of current theories of SLA (Skehan, 2003; Doughty & Long, 2003; Doughty, 2000; Long, 1996), task design, and CALL (Warschauer, 1997; Chapelle 1998) and how those challenges were met for the production of {{a full set of}} materials for a beginners' Spanish distance learning course at the Open University using a tool that had been deemed unsuitable for that level (KÃ¶tter, 2001).
