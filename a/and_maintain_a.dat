5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas metal arc welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>a</b> stable arc.|$|E

5|$|Although such megastructures may be {{theoretically}} possible, all {{plans to}} build a fixed-in-place Dyson sphere are currently far beyond humanity's engineering capacity. However, parts of the technology, like orbiting satellites and solar sails, have already been developed. Deployment of spacecraft and satellites using photovoltaics might be seen as the first small steps towards building a Dyson swarm. However, the number of craft required to obtain, transmit, <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>a</b> complete Dyson sphere far exceeds present-day industrial capabilities. George Dvorsky has advocated use of self-replicating robots to overcome this limitation in the relatively near term. Some have suggested that such habitats could be built around white dwarfs and even pulsars.|$|E
5|$|Banished {{revolves}} around the player guiding citizens of a remote community of outcasts to grow <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>a</b> settlement through a command economy. The game focuses on the player's town as a whole, with {{the citizens of the}} town acting as a resource to be managed. The player must assign citizens to various jobs such as building or fishing. The citizens then perform the job without specific direction from the player. Citizens have needs that must be met in order to keep them happy and healthy, such as ensuring enough food is available or that they have a home. Additional citizens come from two sources, the birth of children and the arrival of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town. The player's citizens will age and eventually die.|$|E
5|$|British law {{requires}} that temazepam (but not midazolam) be stored in safe custody. Safe custody requirements ensures that pharmacists and doctors holding stock of temazepam must store it in securely fixed double-locked steel safety cabinets <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>a</b> written register, which must be bound and contain separate entries for temazepam and must be written in ink with no use of correction fluid (although a written register is not required for temazepam in the United Kingdom). Disposal of expired stock must be witnessed by a designated inspector (either a local drug-enforcement police officer or official from health authority). Benzodiazepine abuse ranges from occasional binges on large doses, to chronic and compulsive drug abuse of high doses.|$|E

5|$|Lassen and Modoc Counties {{organized}} Joint Highway District No. 14 on December 21, 1929 {{to construct}} <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>a</b> road from Susanville via Adin to Oregon. However, since the state {{took over the}} part north of Adin, the district's scope was narrowed to Susanville-Adin. It finally completed work in 1956, and held a ceremony on August 26, in which it placed a monument at a point near Eagle Lake. The legislature added {{the road to the}} state highway system as Route 216 in 1959. The portion south of Horse Lake Road became an extension of Route 20 instead; this route from Susanville to Ravendale (later Termo) was never constructed by the state, and was deleted from SR 36 in 1998. Also in 1959, a spur of Route 210 west to Dorris was added; this became SR 161 in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Prevented from {{cutting the}} French line ahead of Achille, HMS Brunswick turned {{and tried to}} cross aft of her, between Achille and Vengeur. Seeing the manoeuvre, Renaudin also {{accelerated}} to close this new gap, and Brunswick and Vengeur collided, the anchor of Brunswick becoming entangled in the rigging of Vengeur. Vengeur fired an entire broadside at point-blank range, but was then unable to fire her main batteries again, the ships being so close as to prevent French gunners from ramming ammunition into their guns; in contrast, British gunners used rammers with semi-rigid rope handles instead of wooden handles, {{and were able to}} reload <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>a</b> sustained fire, riddling Vengeur with holes. The fight went on for four hours, until Brunswick, after shattering the rudder of Vengeur to prevent her from manoeuvring, separated at 12:45. Her fire also opened a large hole in the hull of Vengeur.|$|E

5|$|The Act {{was passed}} on 11 June 1792, {{creating}} The Company of Proprietors of the Sleaford Navigation, which was empowered to make <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>a</b> Navigation from Sleaford Castle Causeway, {{through the town}} of Sleaford, along the course of Sleaford Mill Stream and Kyme Eau, to the River Witham, at or near Chappel Hill. It had authority to raise £13,000 in capital for the project, with an additional £6,500 if necessary. Most of the money was raised within Lincolnshire, {{with half of the}} shares being bought by people living in Sleaford. Six proprietors were elected to serve on a committee, which expressed its thanks to Joseph Banks at its first meeting. By the end of 1793, £16,000 had been raised to fund construction.|$|E

5|$|The {{speed of}} the HPOTP and HPFTP {{turbines}} depends on {{the position of the}} corresponding oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves. These valves are positioned by the engine controller, which uses them to throttle the flow of liquid oxygen to the preburners and, thus, control engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves increase or decrease the liquid oxygen flow, thus increasing or decreasing preburner chamber pressure, HPOTP and HPFTP turbine speed, and liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen flow into the main combustion chamber, which increases or decreases engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner valves operate together to throttle the engine <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>a</b> constant 6.03:1 propellant mixture ratio.|$|E

5|$|Following peak intensity, the {{combination}} of increasing wind shear and lowering sea surface temperatures began to slowly weaken Iselle, bringing it below Category4intensity early on August5. Continued wind shear caused the storm to further degrade and its eye to become ragged in appearance. The NHC downgraded Iselle below major hurricane intensity at 18:00UTC that day. At 00:00UTC on August6, forecasting responsibility transferred from the NHC to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center(CPHC). Although wind shear began to decrease thereafter, abundant dry air caused Iselle to rapidly weaken, dropping to Category1 intensity on August6. However, the suppressed wind shear allowed for the hurricane to reorganize <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>a</b> large eye as it tracked towards Hawaii, and Iselle reached its secondary peak intensity with winds of 100mph (155km/h) at 00:00UTC on August7, making it a minimal Category2 hurricane. Only slow degradation of Iselle's structure followed, though on August7, the storm's eye had faded and the CPHC estimated that Iselle had weakened to a minimal hurricane. Becoming increasingly disorganized, Iselle weakened to a tropical storm the next day before making landfall at 12:30UTC along the Kau coast of Hawaii island with winds of 60mph (95km/h). The mountainous terrain of the island largely disrupted the main cyclonic circulation of Iselle, which manifested {{as a collection of}} small vortices south of the Hawaiian islands. Due to the loss of any sustained thunderstorm activity at the storm's center, the CPHC decided to downgrade Iselle to a remnant area of low pressure on August9; at the time, the disturbance was centered roughly 200mi (320km) west-southwest of Honolulu.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{his senior}} year, ESPN named {{him as one}} of the top 25 three point {{shooters}} in the national class of 2012. At the time of their November 2011 National Letter of Intent signings, Stauskas, Glenn Robinson III and Mitch McGary gave Michigan a consensus top 10 entering class for its 2012 class. Stauskas visited Michigan along with future teammate Robinson to see the 61–56 New Year's Day 2012 victory by the 2011–12 Wolverines team over Minnesota. Then Stauskas led St. Mark's to 67–57 victory in a 2012 Hoophall Classic contest with 16 points against Friends Central. As the season progressed, Stauskas (and Robinson) improved in the national player ratings to offset McGary's slide <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>a</b> top-rated class. He scored 19 to lead his school to a 59–53 2012 NEPSAC Class AA Championship game victory over Noel's Tilton. Stauskas earned the NEPSAC championship game MVP. He was selected to the 2012 All-NEPSAC Class AA first team (along with teammate Kaleb Tarczewski). Following these honors, Stauskas's stock and rankings continued to rise.|$|E

5|$|The Delaware State Highway Department (DSHD) {{was created}} on April 2, 1917 to {{construct}} <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>a</b> system of state highways across Delaware. As a result, the state took over {{construction of the}} DuPont Highway. The DuPont Highway was completed in 1923 when the final section near Odessa was finished. The DuPont Highway was a boon to southern Delaware, which had formerly been economically isolated from the large cities of the northeast. In conjunction {{with the rise of}} the automobile, the highway spurred the growth of the Delaware Beaches by greatly improving access to the coast for tourists from northern Delaware and adjacent portions of the Northeast megalopolis. Southern Delaware also developed into a major truck farming region due to having much greater access to urban markets. No longer fully reliant on the railroads to transport their goods, farmers in Sussex and Kent counties could market their fruits, vegetables, and broiler chickens directly to consumers in the north. Also during this time, the State Aid Road Law ushered in a period of highway improvement in which the county would offer road bonds and the state would match. The DSHD would then improve the highway. Most of the highways improved by the DSHD were built as concrete roads, with sharp curves eliminated. The state also took over the last of the private turnpikes and converted them to free roads. In 1926, the state began eliminating several railroad grade crossings and in 1927 the first all-weather secondary roads were constructed, consisting of one concrete lane and one dirt lane in an effort to reduce costs.|$|E
5|$|The Mk 41 Stable Vertical (also called Gun Director) was a {{vertical}} seeking gyroscope. Its function {{was to establish}} <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>a</b> stable earth vertical with its associated horizontal plane. With the horizontal plane established, the Mk 41 continuously measured the angles between the deck and the horizontal plane. These deck angles were continuously transmitted to the Rangekeeper {{so that it could}} keep the guns correctly elevated as the ship rolled and pitched. Mounted waist high on its side were the battery's firing keys. (see picture) The left key was the Salvo Signal Key, and it sounded the Salvo Buzzer in each of the turrets to warn the gun crews that the guns were about to fire. The center key (with bumps on its handle for tactile identification) was the Automatic Firing Key. When this key was held closed, the Mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire the guns whenever the ship's deck was parallel the horizontal plane. Also, if the sea state was such that the turrets' elevation power drives could not keep up with the ship's motion, the guns could be held at a fixed elevation, and the MK 41 could again automatically fire the guns as described. The right key was the Hand Firing Key. It bypassed the Mk 41, and fired the guns directly.|$|E
5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>a</b> sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E
