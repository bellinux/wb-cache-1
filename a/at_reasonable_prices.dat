5|$|For example, Sudan’s {{famine in}} the 1980s was {{completely}} intentional, {{and was only}} a pawn for a varied collection of different elites to improve their political and economic statuses. These political parties weren’t the only beneficiaries, though. Merchants were also known to hoard grain and buy livestock at inappropriately low prices when the famines shifted the terms of trade. Western Sudanese merchants during the famine of 1987 were described as heartless because they refused to sell grain to needy villages in Darfur <b>at</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>prices.</b> Ergo, the Sudanese Famine was another example of food power in which food was and used as a policy, and which completely ignored {{the needs of the}} people and fostered the political and power-hungry intentions of opposite warring forces in the country.|$|E

25|$|In 1768 Cooke {{became the}} deputy {{governor}} of the colony under Josias Lyndon, both men leaving their offices after one year. As difficulties with Great Britain worsened, and the Continental Congress formed, Cooke became chairman of the Providence Committee of Inspection. He was responsible for seeing that the town faithfully adhered to the declarations of the Congress relating to trade with Great Britain. Some of the provisions included discontinuing the slave trade; refusing to purchase tea; stopping all exports to and imports from Britain; selling goods <b>at</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>prices,</b> and discouraging horse racing, gaming, expensive shows, and expensive funerals.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1940s, Siegel was lining {{things up}} in Las Vegas while his lieutenants {{worked on a}} {{business}} policy to secure all gambling in Los Angeles. In May 1946, he decided the agreement with Wilkerson had to be altered to give him control of the Flamingo. With the Flamingo, Siegel would supply the gambling, the best liquor and food, and the biggest entertainers <b>at</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>prices.</b> He believed these attractions would lure not only the high rollers, but thousands of vacationers willing to gamble $50 or $100. Wilkerson was eventually coerced into selling all stakes in the Flamingo under the threat of death, and went into hiding in Paris for a time. From this point the Flamingo became syndicate-run.|$|E
25|$|The {{industrial}} use of mechanical meat shredding was the technical advance that helped popularize the Hamburg steak. The first meat grinder {{was invented in}} the early 19th century by the German engineer Karl Drais. The machine {{made it possible for}} minced meat to be sold at market in large quantities <b>at</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>prices.</b> By 1845, numerous patents existed for improved meat grinders in the United States. These machines could all shred meat to sizes before unimaginable. Before this, minced meat was prepared by hand at home using specialized chisels, intensive manual labor that severely limited the amount that could be produced. It is very likely that the invention of the meat grinder contributed directly to the popularization of Hamburg steak, while the steak gradually became distant from its German roots {{in the minds of many}} Americans. Minced meat also came to be used in other popular American foods, including hot dogs and meatloaf.|$|E

25|$|Plants can be {{propagated}} by seed, cuttings, {{and tissue}} culture. Seeds are usually sown on damp chopped Sphagnum moss, or on sterile {{plant tissue culture}} media once they have been properly disinfected. The seeds generally become nonviable soon after harvesting, so seed are not usually the preferred method of propagation. A 1:1 mixture of orchid medium with moss or perlite {{has been used for}} germination and culture. Seed may take two months to germinate, and two years or more to yield mature plants. Cuttings may be rooted in damp Sphagnum moss in a plastic bag or tank with high humidity and moderate light. They can begin to root in one to two months and start to form pitchers in about six months. Tissue culture is now used commercially and helps reduce collection of wild plants, as well as making many rare species available to hobbyists <b>at</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>prices.</b> Nepenthes species are considered threatened or endangered plants and all of the are listed in CITES appendices 2, with the exception of N. rajah and N. khasiana which are listed in CITES appendix 1.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s AMT {{released}} brand new kits with new tooling {{for some of}} their old favorites, such as the 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air, 1966 Ford Fairlane GT, 1958 Edsel Pacer, 1960 Ford Starliner and 1957 Chrysler 300. These kits sold fairly well and can still be found on auction sites such as eBay <b>at</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>prices.</b> The details in these kits far exceeded any from the 1960s. In the late 1990s AMT did something new in releasing pre-assembled and painted versions of these kits. These assembled models were sold as the Masterpiece Series and were nicely packaged in foam, similar to heavier diecast metal Franklin Mint or Danbury Mint models. Each had a Certificate of Authenticity enclosed. These models were beautifully finished and featured whitewall tires along with very detailed and authentically painted engines, suspensions and interiors, much more detailed than any promotional ever was, although these seem to be oriented to the adult collector and not the possible customer. Selections included a 1957 Chrysler 300C, 1960 Ford Starliner, 1962 Chevrolet Impala SS convertible, 1962 Pontiac Catalina SD421, 1966 Buick Riviera {{and a few others}} (Doty 2002b, p87). These ultra detailed models can still be had for less than $30.00 today on eBay and are one of the best bargains around. As assembled kits they were factory-glued together, but the glue used appears to be of high quality and when cared for properly they can be kept in good condition for years.|$|E

The Chilean pharmaceutical policy failed due to pressure from the pharmaceutical industry. In the 1970s Sri Lanka demonstrated that a state buying agency linked to a national formulary was a viable and powerful instrument for reducing drug costs without compromising quality, for saving foreign exchange, for rationalising drug usage and for supplying essential drugs <b>at</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>prices</b> to the whole community. This was made possible by the [...] formulation and implementation of an integrated national pharmaceutical policy.|$|E
