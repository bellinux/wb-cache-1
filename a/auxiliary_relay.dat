Speci cally, we aim to balance {{the total amount of}} data received from the sensor network during its lifetime against a requirement of sucient coverage for all the sensor locations surveyed. Our main contribution lies in formulating this balanced data gathering task and in studying the eects of balancing. We give an LP network ow formulation and present experimental results on optimal data routing designs also with impenetrable obstacles between the nodes. We then proceed to {{consider the}} eect of augmenting the basic sensor network with a small number of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>relay</b> nodes with less stringent energy constraints...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{multiple}} relay arrangement for on-line process identification and controller tuning is proposed. The standard relay feedback method proposed by Astrom and Hagglund (1984) is very popular, {{because it is}} a simple and time efficient technique; moreover it is a closed-loop method and allows a tight control of the magnitude of the oscillations. Unfortunately only the critical point of the process (i. e. the process frequency response at the phase lag of -π) is detected and the acquired information may be insufficient for a correct identification of a large class of processes. Since in chemical processes the duration of each experiment may be critical, multiple identification sessions are undesirable and impracticable; therefore several alternative techniques have been proposed. However the information on the critical point of the process must be retained, often with the need of including some information at frequencies near the crossover point or in the low frequency range. Friman and Waller (1997) introduced a two-channel relay structure in order to extract more information about the process, e. g. to get a point in the third quadrant of Nyquist plane, Wang and Yang (2000) have provided the cascade relay for multipoint identification of the frequency response, Balestrino et al. (2006) have proposed a technique based on a standard relay with a variable hysteresis width, in order to originate relay transients. Several variants of the standard method have been presented in literature (see Wang et al., 2003) : most of them consider various relay connections and give rise to very complex waveforms, usually difficult to analyse. In this paper a master relay is configured as in the standard method of Astrom and Hagglund. Assume that the input of the master relay is periodic. The output of the master relay, um, is converted from real to binary format and, through a shift register or a chain of flip-flops, it gives rise to a sub-harmonic signal which is again converted from binary to real as the input to an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>relay.</b> Any sub-harmonic signal can be generated, but we restrict our attention to the simplest arrangement, where the subharmonic signal us (the output of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>relay)</b> shows a frequency 2 -m of the master relay frequency. The input signal is the sum of the master and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>relay</b> outputs. The conditions assuring a limit cycle can be derived as in the classical approach of Tsypkin (1984). Eventually hysteresis can be added to the master relay, so that a strong robustness is assured with respect to output measurement noises. The implementation of this technique is straightforward by using low cost electronics; examples of simulation tests using Matlab implementation illustrate the technique for some typical plants...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A Bluetooth {{scatternet}} is {{a network}} topology that is formed by inter-connecting piconets. A piconet is a starshaped ad-hoc networking unit that can accommodate eight Bluetooth devices, a master {{and up to}} seven slaves. By designating certain piconet nodes as bridges, or gateways, we can interconnect piconets by forcing the bridge nodes to interleave their participation in multiple piconets. Bridge nodes form an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>relay</b> connection between adjacent piconet masters and are fundamental for establishing scatternets. In this paper we present a new fault-tolerant approach to scatternet formation that is selfhealing and operates in a multi-hop environment. Our Bluetooth Distributed Scatternet Formation Protocol (BTDSP) establishes a flat scatternet topology, allows incremental node arrival, and automatically heals scatternet partitions by re-incorporating disconnected nodes. By maintaining neighbor associations in soft state, existing links can also be re-established quickly upon disconnection due to intermittent wireless connectivity. By only using slave/slave bridges, the algorithm is resilient to both node failure and wireless interference. It also prevents time-slot waste due to master/slave bridges being away from their piconets. Index Terms — Bluetooth, Scatternet, formation, piconet, bridge, personal area networkin...|$|E

40|$|Quantum Foam was a film {{installation}} commissioned for the Kinsale Arts Festival. An Arts Council of Ireland grant enabled {{an accompanying}} series of retrospective solo exhibitions, screenings {{and talks to}} follow the staging {{of the work in}} Kinsale at the Luan Gallery, Athlone, Wexford Arts Centre, Galway Art Centre and The LAB, Dublin with accompanying publication. The piece {{takes the form of a}} theatrically devised sculptural film installation that contrives to articulate the gallery space as a hotly contested mutable territory, notionally shifting its fictive form and function to stage a wildly divergent sequence of monologue-driven scenarios. Delivered by a virtuoso solo performer (actor David Cann), multiple realities are verbally conjured and systematically dismantled at a dizzying rate of knots by an array of characters, yanking the viewer through one imaginative wormhole after another to slowly reveal the gaseous outline of an individual consciousness at the core. Projected onto a vast monolith screen structure, they appear one after another, like a re-tuning TV set, as a series of grotesque composite ‘faces’ splicing the actor’s monstrously enlarged isolated features into peculiar configurations. As the piece progresses, the pace of interruption and interjection proceeds at a hectic clip; two further audio channels <b>relay</b> <b>auxiliary</b> heckles, reaction and commentary from the other characters. The cast of clamouring voices begin to overlap, simultaneously mumbling, shrieking, weeping, barking and succumbing to apoplectic fits of hysterical laughter before resolving into a single voice singing Faron Young’s ‘Hello Walls’ arranged as a ballad with piano accompaniment. The menacing claustrophobia of the isolated room as Harold Pinter’s recurring milieu of choice is a key reference point for the work. The populace of enigmatic invaders, manipulative schemers and hapless victims who collide and collude for control or dominance of space in his drama find a garbled echo in the perpetual imaginative reinvention of the gallery’s function proposed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{main idea}} of the paper is {{investigation}} of the maximum values of current and angle errors of the current transformers {{and the nature of}} their changes in steady-state and transient power system conditions in which the possible output of errors beyond the normalized range of values, as well as a comparison of the degree of change of current and angle errors of the current transformers for power supply auxiliary wiring devices of relaying protection in these conditions. Research methods. The authors used the method of simulation and visualization of the current transformer operation of computers, intended for supply of secondary circuits of relay protection devices in steady and transient conditions of supply power system and different operating modes. The obtained results. The authors defined the percentage of the maximum current and angular error of the primary current transformation to the secondary circuit of the current transformer which are caused by the presence of the magnetizing current and resistive losses in the magnetic system of the test current transformer; their comparison is performed and conclusions are drawn regarding their changes in steady-state and transient conditions, in particular, the fact is established that the current errors in emergency conditions vary to a much greater extent than the angular and under certain conditions may extend beyond the value of the normalized state standards. Scientific novelty. The authors developed the modern method of investigation of current and angle errors of the current transformers for <b>auxiliary</b> supply of <b>relay</b> protection devices based on the use of a computer model of an ideal current transformer with a linear no hysteresis B-H curve, which has similar characteristics and primary and secondary circuit parameters to study the real transformer current. Practical significance. The results can be used in researching the optimum operating current transformers conditions and the development of new principles of perform measurement and logical circuits of relaying protection, in particular, it was concluded that in order to provide the more sensitive and selective protection we can use the devices based on the principle of their action to respond only to the phase relation between the currents of the current transformers and connections that have to be rebuilt only from the angle measurement errors...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I {{investigate}} {{dynamic and}} computational properties of prokaryotic signalling architectures {{commonly known as}} the Two Component Signalling networks and phosphorelays. The aim {{of this study is to}} understand the information processing capabilities of different prokaryotic signalling architectures by examining the dynamics they exhibit. I present original investigations into the dynamics of different phosphorelay architectures and identify network architectures that include a commonly found four step phosphorelay architecture with a capacity for tuning its steady state output to implement different signal-response behaviours viz. sigmoidal and hyperbolic response. Biologically, this tuning can be implemented through physiological processes like regulating total protein concentrations (e. g. via transcriptional regulation or feedback), altering reaction rate constants through binding of <b>auxiliary</b> proteins on <b>relay</b> components, or by regulating bi-functional activity in relays which are mediated by bifunctional histidine kinases. This study explores the importance of different biochemical arrangements of signalling networks and their corresponding response dynamics. Following investigations into the significance of various biochemical reactions and topological variants of a four step relay architecture, I explore the effects of having different types of proteins in signalling networks. I show how multi-domain proteins in a phosphorelay architecture with multiple phosphotransfer steps occurring on the same protein can exhibit multistability through a combination of double negative and positive feedback loops. I derive a minimal multistable (core) architecture and show how component sharing amongst networks containing this multistable core can implement computational logic (like AND, OR and ADDER functions) that allows cells to integrate multiple inputs and compute an appropriate response. I examine the genomic distribution of single and multi domain kinases and annotate their partner response regulator proteins across prokaryotic genomes to find the biological significance of dynamics that these networks embed and the processes they regulate in a cell. I extract data from a prokaryotic two component protein database and take a sequence based functional annotation approach to identify the process, function and localisation of different response regulators as signalling partners in these networks. In summary, work presented in this thesis explores the dynamic and computational properties of different prokaryotic signalling networks and uses them to draw an insight into the biological significance of multidomain sensor kinases in living cells. The thesis concludes with a discussion on how this understanding of the dynamic and computational properties of prokaryotic signalling networks can be used to design synthetic circuits involving different proteins comprising two component and phosphorelay architectures.
