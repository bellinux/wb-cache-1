5|$|In 1921, Hu went to Luzhou in {{southern}} Sichuan, {{the base of}} the progressive warlord Yang Sen, where she worked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> school of South Sichuan Teachers College and studied at the college. She taught two of Yang's five wives (polygamy being legal at the time) to read and befriended another, but when Yang proposed to Hu, she angrily refused to become his sixth wife. When the influential writer Mao Dun heard about her story from a mutual friend, he wrote the novel Rainbow, which was published in 1929. The novel's heroine Mei, modelled after Hu Lanqi's life from 1920 to 1924, would become much better known in China than Hu herself.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, {{at the age}} of 18, Chen began {{attending}} school as a grade one student <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Elementary</b> School for the Blind in Linyi city. In 1994, he enrolled at the Qingdao High School for the Blind, where he studied until 1998. He had already begun developing an interest in law, and would often ask his brothers to read legal texts to him. He earned a position at the Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in 1998 but because his family was poor, they had to borrow $340 to cover tuition costs. They still fell short of the required $400 and university authorities reportedly had to be pleaded with before allowing Chen to enroll. He studied in Nanjing from 1998 to 2001, specializing in acupuncture and massage—the only programs available to the blind. Chen also audited legal courses, gaining a sufficient understanding of the law to allow him to aid his fellow villagers when they sought his assistance. After graduation he returned to his home region and found a job as a masseur in the hospital of Yinan County.|$|E

25|$|Education in Ethiopia was {{dominated}} by the Tewahedo Church for many centuries until secular education was adopted in the early 1900s.

25|$|Minnesotan law {{provides}} that public {{elementary and middle}} schools offer at least three and require at least two courses in the following four arts areas: dance, music, theater and visual arts. Public high schools must offer at least three and require {{at least one of the}} following five arts areas: dance, media arts, music, theater or visual arts. Students may take music <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> and middle school ages, and many choose to take the subject as an elective in high school, where schools often organize marching bands, choruses and other performance opportunities. The Perpich Center for Arts Education is a school of choice which draws students from across the state, and has an extensive modern and classical music education program.|$|E
25|$|As part of Australia's {{commitment}} to the Empire Air Training Scheme, the RAAF established twelve elementary flying training schools in 1940 and 1941. The role of these units {{was to provide a}} twelve-week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF's initial training schools. Flying training was undertaken in two stages; the first involved four weeks of instruction (including ten hours of flying), which were used to determine trainees' suitability to become pilots. Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training (including 65 hours of flying) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> training school. Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to a service flying training school in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators.|$|E

25|$|The 1960s {{was also}} {{a time of great}} federal funding for land grant colleges and {{universities}} in establishing Counselor Education programs. School counseling shifted from an exclusive focus on career development and added personal and social issues paralleling the rise of social justice and civil rights movements. In the early 1970s, Dr. Norm Gysbers began shifting the profession from school counselors as solitary professionals into having a comprehensive developmental school counseling program for all students K-12. He and his colleagues' research evidenced strong correlations between fully implemented school counseling programs and student academic success; a critical part of the evidence base for the profession based on their work in the state of Missouri. Dr. Chris Sink & associates showed similar evidence-based success for school counseling programs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> and middle school levels in Washington State.|$|E

25|$|In Nigeria, school {{counseling}} began in 1959 and exists in some high schools. It rarely exists <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> school level.

However, in many cases, there are only teachers who function as career masters/mistresses. School counselors often have teaching and other responsibilities that take time away from their {{school counseling}} tasks. The Counseling Association of Nigeria (CASSON) was formed in 1976 to promote the profession, {{but there is no}} code of ethics. However, a certification/licensure board has been formed. Aluede, Adomeh, & Afen-Akpaida (2004) discussed the overreliance on textbooks from the USA and the need for school counselors in Nigeria to take a whole-school approach and lessen the focus on individual approaches and honor the traditional African world view that values the family and community's roles in decision-making as paramount for effective decision-making in schools.|$|E
