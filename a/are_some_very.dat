5|$|There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> old public houses, {{which have}} been {{continuously}} open, such as the Golden Cross in Princess Street, the Dun Cow in Abbey Foregate, and the King's Head in Mardol. The Golden Cross is reputed to be the oldest licensed public house in Shrewsbury and records show that it {{was used as an}} inn as far back as 1428. Its original name was the Sextry, because it was originally the sacristy of Old St Chad's Church.|$|E
5|$|Nettlecombe Park is {{important}} for its lichen flora. Records suggest this site has been wood pasture or parkland for at least 400 years. There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> old oak pollards which may be of this age or older. The oldest standard trees are over 200 years of age. The continuity of open woodland and parkland, with large mature and over-mature timber, has enabled characteristic species of epiphytic lichens and beetles to become established and persist. Many of the species in the park are now nationally scarce because this type of habitat has been eliminated over large areas of Great Britain. The park was notified as an SSSI in 1990.|$|E

25|$|A strong {{influence}} on the play is the novel The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger. There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> overt references to it, as when the protagonist explains the thesis paper he has just written on The Catcher in The Rye to the family who takes him in for the night. There are also more subtle allusions made both in the script and in the cinematography of the film version, such as when various characters begin to take on Holden Caulfield-esque characteristics and attitudes.|$|E

There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> old songs of European origin, as well as songs from the English rural tradition that inspired the early New England composers. There are also a handful of songs by European classical composers (Ignaz Pleyel, Thomas Arne, and Henry Rowley Bishop).The book even includes five hymns by Lowell Mason, long ago the implacable enemy of the tradition that The Sacred Harp has preserved to this day.|$|E

Walk from Balatoc to Bum-bag is only for the fit and takes about 5 hours one way.

25|$|For trekkers, the Spiti Valley is a paradise, {{offering}} challenging treks {{to explore}} the new heights of the Himalayas. The treks takes you to the most remote areas including the rugged villages and old Gompas followed by the exotic wildlife trails. Some of the popular trekking routes in the area includes Kaza-Langza-Hikim-Komic-Kaza, Kaza-Ki-Kibber-Gete-Kaza, Kaza-Losar-Kunzum La and Kaza-Tabo-Sumdo-Nako. There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> high altitude treks also {{where you have to}} cross passes- like Parangla Pass (connecting Ladakh with Spiti Valley), Pin Parvati Pass, Baba Pass, Hampta Pass treks, Spiti Left Bank Trek are few to name. Please note that you carry all the necessary things before you head out for a trekking tour to Spiti. Tents, sleeping bags, cooking equipment, heavy wooolens, sunscreen and sunglasses are a must.|$|E
25|$|In France this {{flat and}} simple {{treatment}} {{was to a}} certain extent used. Doors were most suitably adorned in this way, and the split baluster so characteristic of Jacobean work is often to be met with. There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> good cabinets in the museum at Lyngby, Denmark, illustrating these two methods of treatment in combination. But the Swiss and Austrians elaborated this style, greatly improving the effect by the addition of color. However, the best Continental designs adopted the typical acanthus foliage of Italy, while still retaining a certain amount of Gothic feeling in the strength of the lines and the cut of the detail. Panelling often long and narrow was commonly used for all sorts of domestic purposes, a feature being a medallion in the center with a simple arrangement of vase, dolphins, dragons, or birds and foliage filling in the spaces above and below.|$|E

[...] Rita Kempley of The Washington Post granted the film praise, [...] "Enchantment {{on the cutting}} edge, a dark yet heartfelt {{portrait of the artist}} as a young mannequin." [...] She too praised Depp's performance in stating, [...] "... nicely cast, brings the eloquence of the silent era to this part of few words, saying it all through bright black eyes and the tremulous care with which he holds his horror-movie hands.|$|E

The ranghung [...] "self-created" [...] image of Avalokiteśvara enshrined in the utse of the dzong (brought by the Zhabdrung from Tibet) is displayed during the festival. During this five-day festival, also known as Punakha festival, held in February/March, there <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> impressive displays. The important display is a re-enactment of the Tibetan invasion of Bhutan in 1639 where the Tibetans were defeated. In this theatrical display, which was conceived by the [...] Zhabdrung, a mock throwing of a relic to the Mo chu river is dramatized.|$|E

[...] In his review of Family Guy, volume 3, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk wrote [...] " [...] I will say there <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> good episodes in this set, starting with 'Petarded', which sees Peter declared mentally retarded. The ways he takes advantage of this status is classic Family Guy material, while the musical montage here, involving phone calls all over town, is actually quite funny. Plus, the appearance of the Naked, Greased-Up Deaf Guy gave hope that the creators still had that sense of the bizarre in them." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a pure xenon lamp, the {{majority}} of the light is generated within a tiny, pinpoint-sized cloud of plasma situated where the electron stream leaves the face of the cathode. [...] The light generation volume is cone-shaped, and the luminous intensity falls off exponentially moving from cathode to anode. [...] Electrons passing through the plasma cloud strike the anode, causing it to heat. As a result, the anode in a xenon short-arc lamp either has to be much larger than the cathode or be water-cooled, to dissipate the heat. The output of a pure xenon short-arc lamp offers fairly continuous spectral power distribution with a color temperature of about 6200K and color rendering index close to 100. However, even in a high pressure lamp there <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> strong emission lines in the near infrared, roughly in the region from 850–900nm. This spectral region can contain about 10% of the total emitted light. Light intensity ranges from 20,000 to 500,000cd/cm2. An example is [...] "XBO lamp", which is an OSRAM trade name for pure xenon short-arc lamp.|$|E

2500|$|Michael F. Whiting, {{director}} of Brigham Young University's DNA Sequencing Center {{and an associate}} professor in BYU's Department of Integrative Biology, concluded in his article [...] "DNA and the Book of Mormon: A Phylogenetic Perspective" [...] that Book of Mormon critics attempting to use DNA [...] "have not given us anything that would pass the muster of peer review by scientists in this field, because they have ignored the real complexity of the issues involved. Further, they have overlooked the entire concept of hypothesis testing in science and believe that just because they label their results as 'based on DNA,' they have somehow proved that the results are accurate or that they have designed the experiment correctly. At best, they have demonstrated that the global colonization hypothesis is an oversimplified interpretation of the Book of Mormon. At worst, they have misrepresented themselves and the evidence in the pursuit of other agendas." [...] Additionally, although he admits the usefulness of population genetics and of DNA in inferring historical events, he contests that, [...] "given the complexities of genetic drift, founder effect, and introgression, the observation that Native Americans have a preponderance of Asian genes does not conclusively demonstrate that they are therefore not descendants of the Lamanite lineage, because {{we do not know what}} genetic signature that Lamanite lineage possessed at the conclusion of the Book of Mormon record." [...] Lastly, he concludes, [...] " [...] a strong possibility that there was substantial introgression of genes from other human populations into the genetic heritage of the Nephites and Lamanites, such that a unique genetic marker to identify someone unambiguously as a Lamanite, if it ever existed, was quickly lost." [...] and that, [...] "here <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> good scientific reasons for why the Book of Mormon is neither easily corroborated nor refuted by DNA evidence, and current attempts to do so are based on dubious science" [...]|$|E
