The node having received {{a grant from}} the repeater, can transmit a frame. The burst mode, a newly approved feature in IEEE 802. 12 network, allows a node to transmit multiple frames per grant. This paper proposes a bandwidth allocation scheme based on the burst mode to guarantee the deadlines of periodic real-time messages. Once the bandwidth of each node is derived from the lengths and deadlines of periodic messages, a node can transmit the frames up to the allocated bandwidth per grant.

Such a broadcast process must be fast and reliable such as all the vehicles in a certain area receive the message as fast as possible; however, two main problems may arise. On one hand, VANETs suffer from the broadcast storm problem occurring when all the vehicles or a large subset of them rebroadcast a packet. When this occurs, the medium <b>access</b> <b>contention</b> increases, which produces a high delay on message delivery, message collisions, and hidden terminals. On the other hand, VANETs also exhibit the network disconnection problem, {{which is due to}} the vehicles’ mobility that causes network partitioning and becomes eventually the cause for the loss of communication.|$|E

Near-threshold(NT) operation can achieve higher energy efficiency, and the performance scalability can be gained through parallelism. In this paper we describe the design of an open-source RISC-V processor core specifically designed for NT operation in tightly coupled multi-core clusters. We introduce instruction-extensions and microarchitectural optimizations to increase the computational density and to minimize the pressure towards the shared memory hierarchy. For typical data-intensive sensor processing workloads the proposed core is on average 3. 5 x faster and 3. 2 x more energy-efficient, thanks to a smart L 0 buffer to reduce cache <b>access</b> <b>contentions</b> and support for compressed instructions. SIMD extensions, such as dot-products, and a built-in L 0 storage further reduce the shared memory accesses by 8 x reducing contentions by 3. 2 x.

40|$|Scientific {{applications}} face serious performance {{challenges on}} multicore processors, {{one of which}} is caused by <b>access</b> <b>contention</b> in last level shared caches from multiple running threads. The contention increases the number of long latency memory accesses, and consequently increases application execution times. Optimizing shared cache performance is critical to significantly reduce execution times of multi-threaded programs on multicores. However, there are two unique problems to be solved before implementing cache optimization techniques on multicores at the user level. First, available cache space for each running thread in a last level cache is difficult to predict due to <b>access</b> <b>contention</b> in the shared space, which makes cache conscious algorithms for single cores ineffective on multicores. Second, at the user level, programmers are not able to allocate cache space at will to running threads in the shared cache, thus data sets with strong locality may not be allocated with sufficient cache space, and cache pollution can easily happen. To address these two critical issues, we have designed ULCC (User Level Cache Control), a software runtime library that enables programmers to explicitly manage and optimize last level cache usage by allocating proper cache space for different data sets of different threads. We have implemented ULCC at the user level based on a page-coloring technique for last level cache usage management. By means of multiple case studies on an Intel multicore processor, we show that with ULCC, scientific applications can achieve significant performance improvements by fully exploiting the benefit of cache optimization algorithms and by partitioning the cache space accordingly to protect frequently reused data sets and to avoid cache pollution. Our experiments with various applications show that ULCC can significantly improve application performance by nearly 40 %...|$|E

The successful transmission of data over the power lines will make the BPL technology a cost-effective solution for the so-called “last miles” in communication networks [1]. Recently, this effort received a significant boost by {{the approval of the}} IEEE P 1901 standard [20].

Also, we determine the MAC efficiency of the network when it’s operating under both contention-free and contention mode. These results may be helpful in the design of BPL networks...|$|R
