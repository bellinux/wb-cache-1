Motivated by the equivalence of P and <b>S</b> <b>properties</b> for a Z-matrix [2] {{and a similar}} result for Lyapunov and Stein transformations on the space of real symmetric matrices [6, 5], in this paper, we present two results supporting the conjecture that P and <b>S</b> <b>properties</b> are equivalent for a Z-transformation on a Euclidean Jordan algebra. We show that the conjecture holds for Lyapunov-like transformations and Z-transformations satisfying an additional condition...|$|R

40|$|This article seek {{to discuss}} {{the concept of the}} state 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>properties</b> which are {{included}} in the state enterprises (BUMN), especially those which are in the form limited liability companies (Persero). From legal perspective, state 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>properties</b> which are placed in a limited liability companies are separated properties. The inclusion of such properties in a limited liability company brings about a legal consequence, namely, such properties are then legally belong to the company instead of the state. A limited liability company is an independent entity, and hence, physically, the said state 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>properties</b> are then deemed as the share. It suffices to conclude therefore, that the state can not in any way in possession of the company as a whole, but rather merely on the limited amount of share...|$|R

In this paper the notion of type-sequence, given for rings in Barucci et al. (AMS Mem. 125 (598) (1997) Ch. II, 1), is extended to any finitely generated torsion-free R-module of rank 1. A module M, of Cohen–Macaulay type r 1 (M), whose type-sequence is [r 1 (M), 1,…, 1] {{is said to have}} “minimal type-sequence”, briefly m. t. s. The family of m. t. s. R-modules, which includes the canonical module, is described by means of value sets, the conductor c(M), the δ-invariant δ(M) and the C. M. type r 1 (M). In the case of rings the m. t. <b>s.</b> <b>property</b> is called “almost Gorenstein” (see Barucci and Fröberg, J. Algebra 188 (1997) 418 – 442). Inspired by analogous investigations by Barucci and Fröberg, we study in Section 3 the m. t. <b>s.</b> <b>property</b> and the reflexiveness of modules over almost Gorenstein rings...|$|R
