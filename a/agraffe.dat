[...] In modern pianos, the same basic principle is followed: the contact point for the vibrating length of the string that is close to the hammers is either an <b>agraffe</b> or the capo d'astro bar; these devices pull the string in the direction opposite to the hammer blow, just as in Cristofori's original arrangement.|$|E
60|$|He {{had already}} drawn nigh, {{attracted}} by idle curiosity, but now with one bound {{he reached the}} steps. Striking out with his fists at two or three men who barred the way, he suddenly stood confronting these miscreants, {{the light of the}} torch glowing on the rich silk of his doublet, the jewelled <b>agraffe</b> of his hat, his proud, serious face almost distorted by overwhelming wrath.|$|E
60|$|The old pagan {{kept his}} promise to his dying wife. Lady Yarmouth was now in full favour, and treated with {{profound}} respect by the Hanover society, though it appears rather neglected in England when she came among us. In 1740, {{a couple of the}} king’s daughters went to see him at Hanover; Anna, the Princess of Orange (about whom, and whose husband and marriage-day, Walpole and Hervey have left us the most ludicrous descriptions), and Maria of Hesse-Cassel, with their respective lords. This made the Hanover Court very brilliant. In honour of his high guests, the king gave several fêtes; among others, a magnificent masked ball, in the green theatre at Herrenhausen—the garden theatre, with linden and box for screen, and grass for a carpet, where the Platens had danced to George and his father the late sultan. The stage and a great part of the garden were illuminated with coloured lamps. Almost the whole Court appeared in white dominos, “like,” says the describer of the scene, “like spirits in the Elysian fields. At night, supper was served in the gallery with three great tables, and the king was very merry. After supper dancing was resumed, and I did not get home till five o’clock by full daylight to Hanover. Some days afterwards we had in the opera-house at Hanover, a great assembly. The king appeared in a Turkish dress; his turban was ornamented with a magnificent <b>agraffe</b> of diamonds; the Lady Yarmouth was dressed as a sultana; nobody was more beautiful than the Princess of Hesse.” So, while poor Caroline was resting in her coffin, dapper little George, with his red face and his white eyebrows and goggle-eyes, at sixty years of age, is dancing a pretty dance with Madame Walmoden, and capering about dressed up like a Turk! For twenty years more, that little old Bajazet went on in this Turkish fashion, until the fit came which choked the old man, when he ordered the side of his coffin to be taken out, {{as well as that of}} poor Caroline’s who had preceded him, so that his sinful old bones and ashes might mingle with those of the faithful creature. O strutting Turkey-cock of Herrenhausen! O naughty little Mahomet! in what Turkish paradise are you now, and where be your painted houris? So Countess Yarmouth appeared as a sultana, and his Majesty in a Turkish dress wore an <b>agraffe</b> of diamonds, and was very merry, was he? Friends! he was your fathers’ king as well as mine—let us drop a respectful tear over his grave.|$|E

50|$|The American company, Sohmer, {{along with}} Blüthner in Europe, among others, applied this idea to the string {{termination}} {{on the bridge}} in pianos, beginning in the 1890s, where bridge pins are ordinarily used. Most applications of <b>agraffes</b> have been located at the near end of the strings, close to the tuning pins. Stuart has reintroduced the use of <b>agraffes</b> on the bridges (of which their pianos have two).|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the strings}} {{do not need}} to bear down heavily on the bridges (a force of 600 to 1200 pounds = 2.7 to 5.4 kN in {{conventional}} pianos), bridge <b>agraffes</b> may also help preserve the crucial upward curve, or [...] "crown," [...] in the soundboard.|$|R
60|$|The {{figure of}} Rebecca might indeed have {{compared}} with the proudest beauties of England, {{even though it had}} been judged by as shrewd a connoisseur as Prince John. Her form was exquisitely symmetrical, and was shown to advantage by a sort of Eastern dress, which she wore according to the fashion of the females of her nation. Her turban of yellow silk suited well with the darkness of her complexion. The brilliancy of her eyes, the superb arch of her eyebrows, her well-formed aquiline nose, her teeth as white as pearl, and the profusion of her sable tresses, which, each arranged in its own little spiral of twisted curls, fell down upon as much of a lovely neck and bosom as a simarre of the richest Persian silk, exhibiting flowers in their natural colours embossed upon a purple ground, permitted to be visible--all these constituted a combination of loveliness, which yielded not to the most beautiful of the maidens who surrounded her. It is true, that of the golden and pearl-studded clasps, which closed her vest from the throat to the waist, the three uppermost were left unfastened on account of the heat, which something enlarged the prospect to which we allude. A diamond necklace, with pendants of inestimable value, were by this means also made more conspicuous. The feather of an ostrich, fastened in her turban by an <b>agraffe</b> set with brilliants, was another distinction of the beautiful Jewess, scoffed and sneered at by the proud dames who sat above her, but secretly envied by those who affected to deride them.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps {{it was of}} set {{purpose that}} our dinner. party had been given before Clarence's return. Griffith had been {{expected}} in time for it, but he had preferred going by way of London to attend a ball given by {{the daughter of a}} barrister friend of my father's. Selina Clarkson was a fine showy girl, with the sort of beauty to inspire boyish admiration, and Griff's had been a standing family joke, even my father condescending to tease him when the young lady married Sir Henry Peacock, a fat vulgar old man who had made his fortune in the commissariat, and purchased a baronetcy. He was allowing his young wife her full swing of fashion and enjoyment. My mother did not think it a desirable acquaintance, and was restless until both the brothers came home together, long after dark on Christmas Eve, having been met by the gig at the corner where the coach stopped. [...] The dinner-hour had been put off till half-past six, and we had to wait for them, the coach having been delayed by setting down Christmas guests and Christmas fare. They were a contrast; Griffith looking very handsome and manly, all in a ruddy glow from the frosty air, and Clarence, though equally tall, well-made, and with more refined features, looked pale and effaced, now that his sailor tan was worn off. The one talked as eagerly as he ate, the other was shy, spiritless, and with little appetite; but as he always shrank into himself among strangers, it was the less wonder that he sat in his drooping way behind my sofa, while Griffith kept us all merry with his account of the humours of the 'Peacock at home;' the lumbering efforts of old Sir Henry to be as young and gay as his wife, in spite of gout and portliness; and the extreme delight of his lady in her new splendours--a gold spotted muslin and white plumes in a diamond <b>agraffe.</b> He mimicked Sir Henry's cockneyisms more than my father's chivalry approved towards his recent host, as he described the complaints he had heard against 'my Lady being refused the hentry at Halmack's, but treated like the wery canal;' and how the devoted husband 'wowed he would get up a still more hexclusive circle, and shut hout these himpertinent fashionables who regarded Halmack's as the seventh 'eaven.' ...|$|E
50|$|An <b>agraffe</b> {{is a part}} {{found on}} some pianos. The <b>agraffe</b> is a guide at the tuning-pin end of the string, screwed into the plate, with holes through which the strings pass.

5000|$|While <b>agraffes</b> {{continue}} {{to be used in}} the bass, tenor and lower treble of modern instruments, earlier pianos also employed them in the upper treble. The massively cast capo bar, an integral part of the plate, greatly enhanced the clarity and power of the upper treble ...|$|R
50|$|Working {{with natural}} light {{it has to}} be ensured that enough light is available.

5000|$|Hugo Sohmer marketed {{the first}} modern [...] "bijou," [...] or baby grand piano, built with a {{symmetrical}} case design which he patented in 1884. [...] "Only five feet long," [...] these pianos were advertised as [...] "the smallest grand ever manufactured," [...] having [...] "great power and volume of tone, together with the tone-sustaining quality and elastic touch heretofore only found in the concert grand." [...] The company also patented improvements in <b>agraffe</b> bars and actions in 1882, and in 1887 an <b>agraffe</b> for a quadruple strung [...] "reverbation scale" [...] and a pianissimo pedal in uprights, and bridge agraffes in 1890.|$|E

5000|$|Sohmer & Co. was a piano {{manufacturing}} company founded in New York City in 1872.

Sohmer pianos were owned by U.S. President Calvin Coolidge, and composers Victor Herbert and Irving Berlin. Sohmer is now a line of pianos manufactured by Samick Music Corporation in Korea.|$|R
50|$|By late 1859 Mathushek was {{associated}} with Wellington Wells, and coassigned him patents for a repetition action and grand pianos. These overstrung pianos had closely spaced strings arranged at sharp angles to the keyboard following the same principles as the bichord parlor grands introduced in America by Chickering and Sons in the early 1850s (now known as cocked hats) as well as spinet harpsichords, and were also meant to have string clamp bridge <b>agraffes</b> deflecting the strings in order to draw the concave sounding board upwards.|$|R
5000|$|Quality agraffes {{are usually}} made of solid brass {{but can be}} painted or electroplated. They come in 1, 2 or 3-string configurations. They also are {{available}} in 2 different sizes (1/4" [...] and 7/32"). The string holes are usually countersunk. They must be installed perpendicular to the strings and their height is adjusted using thin brass shims. They are sometimes difficult to remove and a broken <b>agraffe</b> usually requires a lengthy repair (especially if they are broken into the plate). Worn string holes sometimes cause a buzzing sound which can be corrected by filing inside the <b>agraffe</b> string hole to remove the imperfection.|$|E
50|$|It {{is claimed}} that bridge agraffes permit {{efficient}} {{transmission of sound}} from the strings to the soundboard, resulting in a very well-sustained tone. Similar results are noted with the brass <b>agraffe</b> used by Sohmer into the 1930s.|$|E

50|$|In 1879 Frederick and Hugo Mathushek, jr. {{patented}} a new {{arrangement of}} bridge <b>agraffes</b> {{combined with a}} development of the front terminations introduced in the 1860 patent. The bridge arrangement, styled the equilibre system, involved deflecting the strings alternately toward {{and away from the}} soundboard to two different levels of hitchpins - a difference claimed to be as much as 15 degrees in one advertisement - in order to minimize the downward strain applied to the sounding board (which is usually less than 2 degrees with conventional pinned bridges).|$|R
50|$|At the 2008 Frankfurt Music Fair, Steingraeber & Söhne {{introduced}} a new grand piano that measures 232 cm in length, {{as well as a}} grand piano with a Carbon carbon fibre soundboard. This type of construction enhances stability when tuning instruments that are subject to extreme climatic fluctuations. If grand pianos are to be housed in the Tropics or played at outdoor concerts, for example, then carbon fibre soundboards make good sense. The left pedal mechanism has been enhanced: when a pianist depresses the left pedal, this causes the mechanism to shift in the usual way. If he/she continues to depress the pedal, the hammers move closer to the strings, which is similar to what happens in uprights. This facilitates playing at extremely soft, pianissimo dynamic levels. Steingraeber has developed an alternative means of guiding the strings over the bridge; it is based upon earlier ideas that were implemented in trials. Normally, the strings go over two bridge pins in a zigzag pattern. In the case of the Steingraeber alternative, bridge <b>agraffes</b> guide the string through a metal roller and press it down onto the bridge from above. In addition, height-adjustable hitch pins allow the string tension to be adjusted. The thinking behind this design feature is twofold: uniform string tension over the bridge improves energy transmission, and when significant string friction at the bridge pins no longer exists, the ability to tune and to hold a tuning is optimized. At the moment, these are not standard features in the production of grand pianos; clients may order them for an additional fee, however. At Steingraeber, a ball bearing mechanism is available {{as an alternative to the}} standard, leather-covered knuckle roller mechanism. Thus, a lower-friction release of the jack makes improved repetition possible. In upright pianos, Steingraeber incorporates a magnet, rather than a spring, into the tip of the jack and the hammer-butt. The magnet brings the jack back into operating position after the it releases. This system is maintenance free and results in faster, more precise repetition.|$|R
50|$|The Stuart and Sons piano {{company of}} Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia makes a piano {{in which there}} are bridge agraffes. Agraffes are a kind of sturdy metal clip that hold the strings in place. They were invented in 1808 by the piano pioneer Sébastien Érard and have long been {{employed}} in quality pianos to terminate the front, that is closer to the player, end of the string. The Stuart and Sons <b>Agraffe</b> device is used to couple the strings to the bridge and soundboard structure. The <b>agraffe</b> defines the string's speaking length (frequency), containing the reaction forces produced by bending the strings as they pass through it. This mechanism negates the need for string down bearing that is required in the traditional pinned bridge system. This method, scientifically proven, ensures a more efficient transmission of sound from the strings to the soundboard, able to make the strings vibrate in a more controlled way, improving the dynamics and ensuring a more successful support.|$|E
5000|$|According {{to musical}} {{instrument}} scholar Grant O'Brien, the inverted wrestplank is [...] "still {{to be found}} in pianos dating from a period 150 years after Cristofori's death." [...] (http://www.claviantica.com/Publications_files/Cristofori_Naples.htm). In modern pianos, the same basic principle is followed: the contact point for the vibrating length of the string that is close to the hammers is either an <b>agraffe</b> or the capo d'astro bar; these devices pull the string in the direction opposite to the hammer blow, just as in Cristofori's original arrangement.|$|E
50|$|The name żupan {{has other}} {{spelling}} variations — czupan (from czupkan, a Crimean Tatar word or alternatively from zuban or ziban — a Turkish word according to Julian Horoszkiewicz), and etymologically {{related to the}} Central Asian chapan. Alternatively, the name originates from the Italian word giuppa (gown) which in turn might have come from Arabic (jubba), although the garment itself probably is of Central Asian nomadic origin. Whether the garment came from Central Asia or Ottoman Turkey or Iran still remains a question, and {{the same applies to}} the allied male garment — the kontusz. The Central Asian origin of this garment may be also deduced from the method of closure of the pre-1680s zupans, for they were closed from right to left — typical to Central Asian fashion, while the sleeve-ends terminated with dog-ears that were almost like gloves without covering the fingers, and were usually upturned to show the differently colored lining. Eventually an <b>agraffe</b> (clasp) or button was attached to this dog-ear sleeve-end to pin it to a sleeve once upturned and thus a cuff was created. This style of cuff was known in the Louis XIV period in France as the Polish cuff and might have {{led to the development of}} colorful military cuffs used in Western armies from 18th century onwards.After the partition of Ukraine in 1663 (The Ruin), the inhabitants of Left Bank Ukraine continued to wear żupan, the name transliterated into жупан, and also adopted the kontusz from their Right Bank counterparts as part of their dress, and therefore żupan was worn by Ukrainian nobility, wealthy merchants, cossacks, wealthier peasants and town dwellers as well as new Russian inhabitants - administrators, soldiers, and settlers. Żupan, along with kontusz, was worn also in Russia, especially during the second half of the 17th century, when Polish male costume became popular at the Tsarish court.|$|E
