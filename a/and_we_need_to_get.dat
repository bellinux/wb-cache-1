5000|$|Hallenga was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer at the age of 23. Her doctor originally dismissed a tumor on Hallenga’s breast as “hormonal” leading to a late diagnosis. Due to this, she now lives with stage four breast cancer. Despite Hallenga’s cancer having spread to her liver and her bones, and having had a lesion on her brain, she has survived her original prognosis by living with terminal cancer for over five years. [...] I {{was diagnosed}} in 2009, and I was diagnosed eight months after first going to the doctors. I was told three times that I was too young to get breast cancer.

5000|$|Medical {{laboratories}} {{operate in}} highly regulated environments that demand consistent quality of patient outputs. The external environment’s {{impact on the}} broader global healthcare industry is also dictating the need for ongoing improvements in quality and delivery while using fewer resources that leads to cost savings. Among other regulations, the Carter Report in the United Kingdom dictates that GBP£200-million in cost savings must be achieved by 2020, while the Affordable Care Act in the United States, also known as Obamacare, imposed further taxation requirements on medical laboratories, reducing cost saving ability. Dr. Jonathan Berg stated at The Royal College of Pathologists' annual meeting in 2012 that [...] "We need to be creative and innovative in the services we offer, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> our finances under control", indicating the critical need for innovation within pathology and a stronger focus on financial controls and performance. Within this context, PinpointBPS was founded as a methodology focusing on innovation, risk reduction and financial impact relating to laboratory performance improvement.|$|E

40|$|The organic {{agriculture}} is very current and controversial topic. There is a never-ending argument {{whether it is}} economically effective and meaningful way {{of taking care of}} plants, animals and environment in general compared to the extensive agriculture. Is it just a huge trickery confusing people, or is it a healthier, environmentally friendlier way of life? In the Czech Republic is the situation even more difficult due to the period of communism. Consumer's knowledge of the principals of {{organic agriculture}} is low <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> inspired by those other countries which are more developed in this area. By cooperation of government, specialists, farmers and consumers we have to intensify promotion and propagation of ideas of organic agriculture. In my work I tried to provoke some of the most controversial topics and to answer some questions related to the organic agriculture. The aim of my work was to analyze the contemporary situation of the organic agriculture in the Czech Republic and by means of interviews with eco-farmers to find out their opinions about important questions. Furthermore, I tried to discover the most significant problems of the organic agriculture in the Czech Republic...|$|E
