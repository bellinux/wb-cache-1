50|$|Proxima Centauri b orbits {{its host}} star every 11.186 {{days at a}} semi-major <b>axis</b> <b>distance</b> of {{approximately}} , which means {{the distance from the}} exoplanet to its host star is one-twentieth of the distance from the Earth to the Sun. Comparatively, Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, has a semi-major <b>axis</b> <b>distance</b> of 0.39 AU. Proxima Centauri b receives about 65% of the amount of radiative flux from its host star that the Earth receives from the Sun - for comparison Mars receives about 43%. Most of the radiative flux from Proxima Centauri is in the infrared spectrum. In the visible spectrum, the exoplanet only receives 2.1% of the light Earth does - for comparison Jupiter receives 3.7% and Saturn 1.1%. So it would usually not get much brighter than twilight anywhere on Proxima Centauri b's surface - yet brighter anyway. The maximum illumination of horizontal ground by twilight at sunrise is about 400 lux, while the illumination of Proxima b is about 2700 lux with quiet Proxima. Also, Proxima has flares. The brightest flare so far observed increased the visual brightness of Proxima about 8 times, which would be a large change from previous level but, at about 17% the illumination of Earth, not very strong sunlight. However, because of its tight orbit, Proxima Centauri b receives about 400 times more X-ray radiation than the Earth does.|$|E
5000|$|... where a is the <b>axis</b> <b>distance,</b> z1 and z2 are {{the number}} of cogs (teeth) {{for each of the}} two wheels (gears). These numbers (or at least one of them) is often chosen among primes to create an even contact between every cog of both wheels, and thereby avoid {{unnecessary}} wear and damage. An even uniform gear wear is achieved by ensuring the tooth counts of the two gears meshing together are relatively prime to each other; this occurs when the greatest common divisor (GCD) of each gear tooth count equals 1, e.g. GCD(16,25)=1; if a 1:1 gear ratio is desired a relatively prime gear may be inserted in between the two gears; this maintains the 1:1 ratio but reverses the gear direction; a second relatively prime gear could also be inserted to restore the original rotational direction while maintaining uniform wear with all 4 gears in this case. Mechanical engineers, at least in continental Europe, usually use the module instead of circular pitch. The module, just like the circular pitch, can be used for all types of cogs, not just evolvent based straight cogs.|$|E

Due to design calculus, there are many variants in order to choose the design parameters; {{the aim is to}} obtain small distances between the V-belts wheels axes and a small number of belts. An important problem is represented by the cases when the designer, according to the design data, may choose both variants of the V-belts: SPA or SPZ.

40|$|Jet Propulsion Laboratory Deep Space Station (DSS) {{location}} solutions {{based on}} two JPL planetary ephemerides, DE 84 and DE 96, at eight planetary encounters were used to obtain weighted least squares estimates of precession and polar motion errors. The solution for precession error in right ascension yields a value of 0. 3 X 10 to the minus 5 power plus or minus 0. 8 X 10 to the minus 6 power deg/year. This maps to a right ascension error of 1. 3 X 10 to the minus 5 power plus or minus 0. 4 X 10 to the minus 5 power deg at the first Voyager 1979 Jupiter encounter if the current JPL DSS location set is used. Solutions for precession and polar motion using station locations based on DE 84 agree well with the solution using station locations referenced to DE 96.

The arrival-time {{distribution}} of shower particles {{far from the}} core has been measured {{as a function of}} shower <b>axis</b> <b>distance</b> at the Akeno Observatory by a cluster of 64 scintillators (total area 16 m’) located near the centre of the 1 km ’ array. More than 3500 1 km 2 array events and about 300 20 km 2 array events have been analysed. We compare parameters z (exponential fit to arrival times), U (conventional dispersion) and t, (rise time) for the specification of the spread in arrival times. From a measurement of time spread, the shower <b>axis</b> <b>distance</b> can be determined with an uncertainty of 25 to 30 % with this detector system. The resulting uncertainty in shower size, including a 6 OYO uncertainty in particle density measurement, is 120 to 140 %.

The method may be useful for anisotropy studies, when a system for finding direction is included. 1...|$|E

Here we perform 3 D regional group comparisons of the surface anatomy of the CC between 12 preterm and 11 term-born neonates. We reconstruct CC surfaces from manually segmented brain MRI and build parametric meshes on the surfaces by computing surface conformal parameterizations with holomorphic 1 -forms. Surfaces are registered by constrained harmonic maps on the parametric domains and statistical comparisons {{between the two groups}} are performed via multivariate tensor-based morphometry (mTBM).
