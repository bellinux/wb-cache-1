5|$|An {{alternative}} view {{holds that}} unsafe medical practices in Africa during years following World War II, such as unsterile reuse of single use syringes during mass vaccination, antibiotic, and anti-malaria treatment campaigns, were the initial vector {{that allowed the}} virus to <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> humans and spread.|$|E
40|$|An afterimage's shape changes {{systematically}} {{depending on}} the <b>adapted</b> shape. <b>Adapting</b> <b>to</b> circles produces polygonal afterimages, whereas <b>adapting</b> <b>to</b> hexagons sometimes produce circular afterimages. In this study, a right-eye afterimage produced by <b>adapting</b> <b>to</b> circles was tested while the left eye <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> a plain background, static circles, rotating circles, rotating stars, or rotating hexagons. Subjects rated the subjective roundness of the right-eye afterimage. Although the right eye <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> circles, the ratings varied with the left-eye adaptation. After the left eye <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> rotating hexagons, the right-eye afterimages were rated highest (most circular). In contrast, after the left eye <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> rotating circles, the right-eye afterimages were rated lowest (most angular). This interocular transfer of shape adaptation demonstrates that afterimage shape is determined in a cortical area that collects information from both eyes...|$|R
50|$|Usually, null tetrads <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> spacetime {{properties}} are employed {{to achieve the}} most succinct NP descriptions. For example, a null tetrad can be <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> principal null directions once the Petrov type is known; also, at some typical boundary regions such as null infinity, timelike infinity, spacelike infinity, black hole horizons and cosmological horizons, tetrads can be <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> boundary structures. Similarly, a preferred tetrad <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> on-horizon geometric behaviors is employed in the literature to further investigate NEHs.|$|R
50|$|Some {{species are}} well <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> Tropical dry or {{deciduous}} forests, including Monsoon forests and Dry Monsoon forest.Some Endiandra present a convergent evolution due to ecological or physical drivers toward a similar solution, including analogous structures with species <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> different environments, for example with plants <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> Laurel forest habitat. These Endiandra resemble other genera in the Lauraceae family, and their leaves are lauroid type with berries eaten and dispersed mostly by birds. Others are even <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> very wet media.|$|R
5|$|Baird defended another Conservative {{government}} decision to cut funds for climate science research, arguing that further studies are largely superfluous {{in light of}} recent United Nations reports. Gordon McBean of the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences has disagreed, claiming that further research {{is the best way to}} <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> a changing climate.|$|E
5|$|Caprella mutica inhabit shallow {{protected}} marine {{bodies of}} water. They {{can often be}} found in dense colonies attached to submerged artificial structures, marine macroalgae, and other organisms. They are primarily omnivorous detritivores, but can <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> other feeding methods depending on food availability. They are preyed upon by fish, crabs, and several other predators.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Stalin {{closed down}} {{independent}} artists' unions; former avant-garde artists had to <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> the new climate or risk being officially criticised or even blacklisted.

5|$|Initially {{developed}} by a small team at Ubisoft Reflections for internal release, the game became popular between co-workers and was eventually planned for official release, confirmed in a blog post by Ubisoft on January 22, 2015.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that aposematism and mimicry is less evident in marine invertebrates than terrestrial insects because predation is a more intense selective force for many insects, which also disperse as adults rather than as larvae and have much shorter generation times. Further, {{there is evidence that}} fish predators such as blueheads may <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> visual cues more rapidly than do birds, making aposematism less effective.|$|E
50|$|A {{herbivore}} is {{an animal}} anatomically and physiologically <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> eating plant material, for example foliage, {{for the main}} component of its diet.

40|$|Biotic {{response}} of calcareous nannoplankton to abrupt warming across the Paleocene/Eocene boundary reflects a primary response to climatically induced parameters including increased continental runoff of freshwater, global acidification of seawater, high sedimentation rates, and calcareous nannoplankton assemblage turnover. We identify ecophenotypic nannofossil species <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> low pH conditions (Discoaster anartios, D. araneus, Rhomboaster spp.), excursion taxa <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> the extremely warm climatic conditions (Bomolithus supremus and Coccolithus bownii), three {{species of the}} genus Toweius (T. serotinus, T. callosus, T. occultatus) <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> warm, rather than cool, water conditions, opportunists <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> high productivity conditions (Coronocyclus bramlettei, Neochiastozygus junctus), and species <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> oligotropic and/or cool‐water conditions that went into refugium during the PETM (Zygrablithus bijugatus, Calcidiscus? parvicrucis and Chiasmolithus bidens). Discoaster anartios was <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> meso- to eutrophic, rather than oligotrophic, conditions. Comparison of these data to previous work on sediments deposited on shelf settings suggests that local conditions such as high precipitation rates and possible increase in major storms such as hurricanes resulted in increased continental runoff and high sedimentation rates that affected assemblage response to the PETM...|$|R
50|$|Drought {{tolerance}} {{refers to}} {{the degree to which}} a plant is <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> arid or drought conditions. Desiccation tolerance is an extreme degree of drought tolerance. Plants naturally <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> dry conditions are called xerophytes.|$|R
5|$|Species {{that were}} unable to <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> the {{changing}} environment and competition from other life forms became extinct.

5|$|The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} {{has the lowest}} level of genetic {{variability}} among the 18 pinniped species, allegedly due to a population bottleneck caused by intense hunting in the 19th century.

Given the monk seal's small population, the effects of disease could be disastrous.|$|E
