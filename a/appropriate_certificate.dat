This paper proposes solutions that are based on secure i-mediation and a hybrid PKI model, which unifies X. 509 and SPKI. We present a mediation functionality, called f-mediation. Secure f -mediation assists entities in finding partners for i-mediation and providing them with <b>appropriate</b> <b>certificates</b> and credentials.

5000|$|However, since SLP 2.0 was introduced, hackers {{have been}} able to create {{modified}} bootloaders based on the bootloader GRUB4DOS; these are capable of emulating a SLP text string (such as one for Dell, Acer, and so on), so it appears to be present in the BIOS. This combined with an OEM certificate and OEM product key can instantly activate a Windows Vista/7 installation illegally but also be very hard to notice. This method can also be integrated into a Windows installation disk to activate on initial boot. [...] Another method consists of modding the BIOS to insert the SLP 2.1 table, which can be used to replace blacklisted keys, or to add the SLP table to motherboards that do not have it (such as Gigabyte). Some brand-name computers such as Dell, already have the SLP table in their BIOS, which means that using software readily available on the Internet, a pirated retail installation can be converted to OEM, and the <b>appropriate</b> <b>certificate</b> installed into the OS, which results in Windows becoming genuine.

Building on recent work by Fraigniaud and Pelc [LATIN 2012, LNCS 7256, pp. 362 - 374], we introduce several natural new computability classes allowing for a finer classification of problems below co-MAV or MAV, the latter being the class of {{problems that are}} verifiable when the agents are provided with an <b>appropriate</b> <b>certificate.</b> We provide inclusion and separation results among all these classes. We also determine their closure properties with respect to set-theoretic operations.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} is the analysis of and verification of discrete time stochastic systems using martingales. Martingale theory yields a powerful set of tools that have recently been used to prove	quantitative properties of stochastic systems such as stochastic safety. In this thesis, {{we focus on the}} analysis of qualitative trace properties of stochastic systems such as almost sure reachability and termination,	persistence and recurrence. An almost sure reachability property F(T) states that with probability 1 the executions of the system reach a target set of states T. A qualitative persistence property FG(T) specifies that almost all executions of the stochastic system eventually reach the target set T and stay there forever. Likewise, a recurrence property GF(T) specifies that a target set of states T is visited infinitely often by almost all executions of the stochastic system. For each type of property, we present deductive reasoning techniques in the form of proof rules that rely on finding an <b>appropriate</b> <b>certificate</b> function to establish almost sure reachability, persistence and recurrence properties of infinite-state, discrete time polynomial stochastic systems. Next, we extend known efficient constraint-based and abstract interpretation-based invariant synthesis techniques to deduce the necessary supermartingale expressions to partly mechanize such proofs. 	We demonstrate that martingale certificates can serve as expectation invariants and generalize this idea to sets of mutually inductive expectation invariants. [object Object] Finally, we explore the connection between the properties of our martingale certificates and existing concentration of measure results to establish probability bounds on the quantitative version of these properties...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} few decades tourism has {{developed}} into a complex service industry. Local destinations have to offer only their best in order to satisfy tourists. In that respect, tourist guides represent {{an important part of the}} tourism industry. Local tourist guides should represent the local community and show the most important and the most interesting sights of a given destination. In order to become a tourist guide one must obtain proper education and an <b>appropriate</b> <b>certificate.</b> Taking into account the tourist market needs and incoming tourist groups, tourist guides should be adequately prepared. The purpose of this study is to define the importance of education within the tourism industry and particularly tourist guides. The educational program should provide the necessary knowledge and practices in order to ensure a high quality of future employees in the tourism sector. The education program, the institutions where the program can be attended as well as the criteria for exam are prescribed by law. Croatia is a tourism-oriented country and has an increasing number of tourist arrivals. The total contribution of tourism in the GDP is around 30 %. It can therefore be concluded that tourism is a very important industry for Croatia. The present research is carried out by the case study method. The main findings of this study are showing a strong disagreement between the theoretical findings and given government and organizational efforts in the education program. There are several possible reasons for this situation: belated development, an inadequate approach to tourism development etc. Recommendations for further studies are focused on finding reasons for the current situation and forming suitable procedures to overcome these limitations, in order to form a high quality education and ensure high quality service of local tourist guiding...|$|E
