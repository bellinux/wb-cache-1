These include waste management, the youth offending service, Hereford & Worcester Fire & Rescue Service <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> station BBC Hereford & Worcester. Meanwhile, the BBC's commercial radio counterpart; Free Radio (formerly Radio Wyvern) broadcasts to the two counties and is regarded as a single licence area by the Office of Communications. West Mercia Police is still shared with Herefordshire, Shropshire and Telford & Wrekin.

5|$|On 25 June 1916, Brussels left Hoek van Holland {{bound for}} Harwich. Lights were shown {{from the beach}} and a flare was fired. A {{passenger}} {{is reported to have}} remained on deck and signalled to shore. Five German destroyers surrounded Brussels. The passengers were told to prepare to take to the lifeboats and orders were given for official papers to be destroyed, which was done successfully. Brussels was taken by the Germans, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> was destroyed. She was escorted into Zeebrugge and then to Bruges.|$|E
5|$|The Terrestrial Trunked Radio {{network has}} three {{components:}} the core net, {{which is a}} centralized computer center based on an Internet Protocol structure; the transmission net, which connects the core net, the radio net and other connection points with high-capacity lines; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> net, which consists of base stations with antennas in masts, on buildings and in some tunnels. The network is controlled by Motorola. In case a base station no longer can communicate with the core net, the base station can still relay communication within its range. Should the base station fall out or operations occur in areas without coverage, the terminals can communicate directly with each other.|$|E

5|$|Disorder {{spread across}} the {{province}} as large processions ignored section 144 and condemned {{the actions of the}} police. More than 30,000 people congregated at Curzon Hall in Dhaka. During the continued protests, police actions led to the death of four more people. This prompted officers and clerks from different organisations, including colleges, banks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> station, to boycott offices and join the procession. Protesters burned the offices of two leading pro-government news agencies, the Jubilee Press and the Morning News. Police fired on a major janaza, or mourning rally, as it was passing through Nawabpur Road. The shooting killed several people including activist Sofiur Rahman and a nine-year-old boy named Ohiullah.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before noon}} on 19 February, he used around fifty tanks, their crew and {{a mixture of}} {{infantry}} battalions to seize {{control of the military}} headquarters, the post office <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> station of Saigon. He surrounded the home of General Khánh and Gia Long Palace, the residence of head of state Phan Khắc Sửu. The tanks were led by Colonel Dương Hiếu Nghĩa, a Catholic member of the Đại Việt. The country was still trying to find stability, with Phan Huy Quát being appointed prime minister just three days earlier. Khánh managed to escape and flee to Vũng Tàu. His plane lifted off from Tan Son Nhut Air Base, the country's military headquarters, just as rebel tanks were rolling in, attempting to block the runway. Thảo's men tried to capture the Saigon base of the Republic of Vietnam Navy, and its commander, Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, but were foiled, but they did capture a number of junta members at Tan Son Nhut.|$|E
5|$|The Who first {{performed}} the song {{live at the}} opening date {{of a series of}} Lifehouse related concerts in the Young Vic theatre, London on 14 February 1971. It has subsequently been part of every Who concert since, often as the set closer and sometimes extended slightly to allow Townshend to smash his guitar or Moon to kick over his drumkit. The group performed live over the synthesizer part being played on a backing tape, which required Moon to wear headphones to hear a click track, allowing him to play in sync. It was the last track Moon played live in front of a paying audience on 21 October 1976 and the last song he ever played with the Who at Shepperton Studios on 25 May 1978, which was captured on the documentary film The Kids Are Alright. The song was part of the Who's set at Live Aid in 1985, Live 8 in 2005, T4 on the Beach in 2008 and Capital FM's Summertime Ball concert in 2009, 2010 and 2015 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> station's Jingle Bell Ball concerts in 2009 and 2015.|$|E

5|$|The aircraft's {{captain was}} Ditlev Pentz Smith. Aged 27, {{he had started}} flying for the Norwegian Army Air Service in 1930, and later become a {{civilian}} pilot for Widerøe. He {{was considered one of}} the country's most renowned pilots and was active with competition flights. He was assisted by First Officer Erik Storm, aged 32, who had a background from the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service. The reserve pilot was Peter Ruth Paasche, aged 21, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> operator was Per Erling Hegle, aged 28 and a trained mechanic. All four had been chosen to regularly fly the Bergen–Tromsø route. The three passengers were Inspector Sven Svensen Løgit, Consul Wilhelm Andreas Mejdell Dall and journalist Harald Wigum of Bergens Tidende.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle at}} the palace {{continued}} until guards surrendered to the revolutionaries the following morning. The radio station was first to fall, secured after a loyalist officer was killed and resistance collapsed. The armory was perhaps the easiest target, as a written order from Sallal was sufficient to open the storage facility, beat the royalists, and secure rifles, artillery and ammunition for the revolutionaries. The telephone exchange likewise fell without any resistance. At the Al-Wusul Palace, revolutionary units remained secure {{under the guise of}} granting and protecting diplomats and dignitaries staying there to greet the new Imam of Yemen. By late morning on September 26, all areas of San'a were secure <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> broadcast that Muhammad al-Badr had been overthrown by the new revolutionary government in power. Revolutionary cells in the cities of Taiz, Al-Hujja and the port city of Hodeida then began securing arsenals, airports and port facilities.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer then {{attended}} the advanced Flugzeugführerschule C 3 (FFS C 3—advanced flight school) at Alt Lönnewitz near Torgau and the blind flying school Blindflugschule 2 (BFS 2—2nd blind flying school) at Neuburg an der Donau from August 1940 to May 1941. This qualified him to fly multi-engine aircraft. During this assignment {{he was promoted}} to Fähnrich (cadet sergeant) on 1 September 1940, to Oberfähnrich (rank equivalent to Company Sergeant Major) on 1 February 1941 and to the officer rank of Leutnant (second lieutenant) on 1 April 1941. He was then posted for ten weeks to the Zerstörerschule (destroyer school) at Wunstorf near Hanover. At Wunstorf, Schnaufer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> operator (Bordfunker) Friedrich Rumpelhardt were assigned as an aircrew team on 3 July 1941. Schnaufer's previous radio operator had proved unable to cope with aerobatics, and Schnaufer thoroughly tested Rumpelhardt's ability to cope with aerobatics before they teamed up. Here the two decided to volunteer to fly night fighters to defend against the increasing Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command offensive against Germany. Following their training at Wunstorf, the two were sent to the Nachtjagdschule 1 (1st night fighter school) at Schleißheim near Munich, formerly the Zerstörerschule 1 (ZS 1—1st destroyer school), to learn the rudiments of night-fighting. The night fighter training was carried out on the Ar 96, the Fw 58 and the Messerschmitt Bf 110. Training at night focused on night takeoffs and landings, cooperation with searchlights, radio-beacon direction finding and cross country flights.|$|E
