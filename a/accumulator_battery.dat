There were three internal fuel tanks, two in the crew area and one in the engine compartment, for a total capacity of 600-615 litres. These were usually enhanced by four unconnected external fuel tanks, which could hold an additional 360 litres of fuel.

5000|$|In 1901 the Hotel Pontresina was {{connected}} to the power grid. The existing electricity power generation set-up, which had been installed in 1891 was no longer needed, and records accordingly show the sale of two petrol (gasoline) powered DC generators, each rated at 7 hp and producing 40 amps at 120 volts. An <b>accumulator</b> <b>battery</b> and a circuit board were also sold off at this point.Technical progress also impacted transport links. On 1 July 1903 the Albula Railway opened between Thusis and Samedan, which connected the Engadin region with the cantonal capital, Chur. Hitherto hotel guests had been required to undergo a ten-hour journey, normally by post carriage, via the Julier or Albula Pass in order to reach Pontresina from Chur. That ten hour post carriage journey was now replaced with a four-hour railway journey. At Samedan Station trains were met by the Hotel Pontresina's own horse-drawn bus for the final 6 km (4 mile) climb up the valley to Pontresina. [...] It was exactly another five years before the branch line passing through Pontresina opened, on 1 July 1908, in the process linking the Albula railway to the Bernina railway and creating a through route to Tirano in Italy.|$|E

With today's components, such as electrically-driven pumps, motors and valves, and electronic control systems have hydraulic technology flexibility significantly increased, which has provided unique opportunities to build energy-efficient hydraulic system with good controllability. The implementation of energy efficient systems is not simple, as it requires that the system concept closely matched to the machine / vehicle primary power source, cycle and performance requirements, and that the hydraulic system is integrated with the system's mechanical units so that frictional losses are minimized.

40|$|Abstract — The {{increasing}} demand of electric power in electric vehicles cannot be supplied by conventional automotive power networks. Therefore novel power bus systems, capable {{to deliver the}} required power are under development. These bus systems have higher operating voltages, which result in lower current amplitudes for power transmission. As power efficiency {{is one of the}} main factors determining the range of an electric car with a given battery capacity, fast slew rates of the power semi-conductors are preferred. But with increasing slew rates also emitted radio frequency (RF) disturbances increase. To reduce electromagnetic interferences (EMI) of power electronics a complete shielding of the power bus system is necessary. Thus the network configuration is changed from unshielded single core multi wire harnesses into coaxial conductor layouts, and therefore also the impedance characteristics of the entire network are changed. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of automotive components is measured according to CISPR 25, substituting the vehicle environment with line impedance stabilization networks (LISN). Recent research shows that LISNs, developed for low voltage networks, are not ideal to measure conducted emissions of high voltage (HV) components because of changed characteristic impedances and additional shielding. This paper deals with a method of determining the high-frequency impedances of automotive HV power networks. A Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) is used to measure Scattering parameters of different HV power cables and an automotive Li-Ion <b>accumulator</b> <b>battery.</b> Matrix conversions allow calculating an impedance network, which is able to represent an automotive HV networks...|$|E
