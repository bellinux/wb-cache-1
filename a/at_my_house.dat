And then I went and I played it for [...] and I just {{basically}} told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell them things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing. And so that song specifically, you know, I did everything." ...|$|E
500|$|For Stampede, {{the members}} went to drummer Vinnie Paul's Texas home studio, for a {{recording}} process draped in a relaxed, pressure-free atmosphere, {{surrounded by the}} obligatory cocktails, good eats and familial brotherhood. [...] "We were doing it <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> solely. We ate, drank and BBQed together, which made the brotherhood that happened, come through in the music," [...] Paul said. The band members lived in bungalows on the grounds and turned Paul's house into a studio. Drums were recorded downstairs and guitars were recorded upstairs, with video screens in each room so the members could see one another while tracking. [...] "It’s a broad, diverse album that covers rock, heavy metal and Southern rock ground. That is {{the main thing that}} I like about it: it’s not so focused on one thing," [...] Paul said. The high ceilings at the Paul home allowed {{for the creation of a}} big, booming sound. They also were able to work at their own natural pace. [...] "We slept there, so if one of us just came up with an idea, we could jump on it," [...] guitarist Tom Maxwell said.|$|E

Morey explained in the interview [...] "I have Middle Eastern friends throughout the U.S. who continually feed me information {{as to what the}} terrorists are up to". [...] "I, in turn, feed that information to the FBI and Naval Intelligence. I’ve been right so many times the FBI showed up <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>house,</b> suspicious {{as to whether or not}} I was somehow involved—because I knew too much.

2500|$|Ward {{said that}} {{although}} Burton is a talented actress and {{has done a great}} job with the character, she did not feel she had to get to know her in order to proceed with the drawings. [...] "It was the character I was drawing for and I learned what I needed to from the show and the scripts," [...] she stated. In describing the process of drawing for a particular episode, she said she would mostly get input from Robbie Beck, the props master for the show. [...] "Schwahn always knew exactly what he wanted and it would be described in the script. So Robbie would send me the info and I would initially do some quick sketches," [...] stated Ward. All of their communication was via e-mail. [...] "I wish I could say something more exciting, like [...] and I would chat about what Peyton would be drawing," [...] stated Ward, [...] "but the only time I ever spoke with her was when they were filming <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> in Wilmington (which oddly enough was Peyton’s house on the show.)" [...] Despite this, Ward said she did not mention to Burton that she was the artist behind Peyton's artwork.|$|E
2500|$|One {{specific}} {{scene in}} the film perceived {{as an example of}} anti-Semitism was in the dialogue of Caiaphas, when he states [...] "His blood [...] on us and on our children!", a quote historically interpreted by some as a curse taken upon by the Jewish people. Certain Jewish groups asked this be removed from the film. However, only the subtitles were removed; the original dialogue remains in the Hebrew soundtrack. When asked about this scene, Gibson said: [...] "I wanted it in. My brother said I was wimping out if I didn't include it. But, man, if I included that in there, they'd be coming after me <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>house.</b> They'd come to kill me." [...] In another interview when asked about the scene, he said, [...] "It's one little passage, and I believe it, but I don't and never have believed it refers to Jews, and implicates them in any sort of curse. It's directed at all of us, all men who were there, and all that came after. His blood is on us, and that's what Jesus wanted. But I finally had to admit {{that one of the reasons}} I felt strongly about keeping it, aside from the fact it's true, is that I didn't want to let someone else dictate what could or couldn't be said." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{project was}} {{supported}} by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. [...] Both were “farm-boy” bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927. Governor Fisher supported McCreight’s proposal. “The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested {{in the use of}} the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out. [...] My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with my old friend Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford.” McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for [...] "Young America". “The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them. [...] Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is nothing that I know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there. [...] Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them. [...] Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means. [...] I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways. [...] I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, the ones I have in mind to have for it. [...] Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too. [...] Good Face has been here before. [...] He told me he was <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> nearly thirty years ago. [...] Now that you understand what I have in mind, there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and I wish you would think about it and write me again how you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan.” In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that “two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.” [...] McCreight’s vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the Great Depression, the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.|$|E

I remember a funny dinner <b>at</b> <b>my</b> brother's, where, amongst a few others, were Babbage and Lyell, both of whom liked to talk. Carlyle, however, silenced every one by haranguing during the whole dinner on the advantages of silence. After dinner Babbage, in his grimmest manner, thanked Carlyle for his very interesting lecture on silence.|$|R
