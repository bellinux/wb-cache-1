40|$|We have modeled the {{switching}} {{behavior of}} a TN cell using the one dimensional Ericksen-Leslie equations of nematodynamics. We compare the modeling results with experimental data on the luminance versus time of a normally white twisted nematic (NWTN) cell. Excellent agreement between experiment and model is achieved at all voltages and viewing angles. To achieve this agreement, only two viscosity parameters are required; these are combinations of the Leslie viscosity coefficients, namely g 1 (i. e. a 3 -a 2) and a 4 +a 5. These parameters are easily determined from dynamic optical measurements of a TN cell. With an adaptive time step, the equations can be solved on a time scale that makes interactive computing possible. Combined accuracy and speed make the model useful as a device design tool. For example, liquid crystal response to different <b>active</b> <b>addressing</b> schemes could be accurately modeled, {{eliminating the need for}} costly and time consuming testbedding of different schemes.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in the complexity of chips and the popularity of portable devices, the performance demand is not any more the only important constraint in the embedded system. In stead, energy consumption {{has become one of}} the main design issues for contemporary embedded systems, especially for I/O interface due to the high capacitance of bus transition. In this paper, we propose a bus encoding scheme, which may reduce transitions by reconstructing active address streams with variable cached strides. The key idea is to obtain the variable strides for dierent sets of <b>active</b> <b>addressing</b> streams such that the decoder reconstructs these interlaced streams with these strides. Instead of sending the full address, the encoder may only send partial ad- dress or stride by using either one-hot or binary-inversion encoding. To exploit the locality and dynamically adjust the value of stride of active address streams, we partially compare the previous addresses of existing streams with the current address. Hence, the data transmitted on the bus can be minimally encoded. Experiments with several MediaBench benchmarks show that the scheme can achieve an average of 60 % reduction in bus switching activity. Facultad de Informátic...|$|E

After an analytical and numerical modeling the micromirrors were designed and fabricated by means of aluminum surface-micromachining. Using a basic pixel size of 40 x 40 mu m 2 a mechanical stroke of at least 450 nm could be achieved at address voltages below 30 V, which is suitable for both <b>active</b> matrix <b>addressing</b> and a phase correction modulo 2 pi in the visible. This also includes the option of an incremental increase of the actual mirror size in units of the address grid in order to allow for an extended analog deflection range.

40|$|This paper {{intends to}} provide a better {{understanding}} of how to rebuild a crisis affected area and how to plan for the inhabitants of a wounded city. It will also examine the landscape architect's tasks in this work {{to provide a}} planning perspective. The discussion of reconstruction is significant because the insight and knowledge in the subject is needed in order to help nations after a disaster. Bosnia-Herzegovina's capital Sarajevo is a city recovering from a civil war where the city's situation was complicated by an ethnic conflict that has been segregating it. The restoration of the city's structure can free people from their tragedy and make them live again. The study describes the subject of reconstruction and finds out what has been done in Sarajevo and how the discussions on this went, and also how to take on the task when planning for the victims of the conflict. Sarajevo siege in 1995 left the city in tatters and the non-profit organizations made a heavy reconstruction work possible. The city has been able to reconstruct the landmarks and buildings through external donations, which gave funds to the selected cultural heritage. The difficulty lies in integrating these with existing settlements and in the broader context of the changing culture war meant. There is also a problem that external organizations have made the choices restoring even though they are not fully aware of the city's culture. Politicians have a big impact on the planning of the reconstruction area where people are left outside and quickly composed master plans does not maintain a sustainable structure in the city. This is a landscape design issue that is rarely discussed but is highly relevant to the <b>active</b> <b>addressing.</b> Landscape perspective must be addressed when a war-torn city is to be rebuilt because the reconstruction affects the landscape...|$|E

Hence, we present a new worm detection scheme, History-based IP Worm Detection, that can detect these hitlist worms.

This property is used to implement a weighted source address counting scheme, and a change point detection technique is used to detect surges in the rate of source addresses seen. I...|$|R

40|$|Privacy-minded Internet service {{operators}} anonymize IPv 6 addresses by truncating {{them to a}} fixed length, perhaps due to long-standing use of {{this technique}} with IPv 4 and a belief that it's "good enough. " We claim that simple anonymization by truncation is suspect since it does not entail privacy guarantees nor does it take into account some common address assignment practices observed today. To investigate, with standard activity logs as input, we develop a counting method to determine a lower bound {{on the number of}} <b>active</b> IPv 6 <b>addresses</b> that are simultaneously assigned, such as those of clients that access World-Wide Web services. In many instances, we find that these empirical measurements offer no evidence that truncating IPv 6 addresses to a fixed number of bits, e. g., 48 in common practice, protects individuals' privacy. To remedy this problem, we propose kIP anonymization, an aggregation method that ensures a certain level of address privacy. Our method adaptively determines variable truncation lengths using parameter k, the desired number of active (rather than merely potential) addresses, e. g., 32 or 256, that can not be distinguished from each other once anonymized. We describe our implementation and present first results of its application to millions of real IPv 6 client <b>addresses</b> <b>active</b> over a week's time, demonstrating both feasibility at large scale and ability to automatically adapt to each network's address assignment practice and synthesize a set of anonymous aggregates (prefixes), each of which is guaranteed to cover (contain) at least k of the <b>active</b> <b>addresses.</b> Each address is anonymized by truncating it to the length of its longest matching prefix in that set...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we report}} on {{techniques}} and analyses that enable us to capture Internet-wide activity at individual IP address-level granularity by relying on server logs of a large commercial content delivery network (CDN) that serves close to 3 trillion HTTP requests on a daily basis. Across the whole of 2015, these logs recorded client activity involving 1. 2 billion unique IPv 4 addresses, the highest ever measured, in agreement with recent estimates. Monthly client IPv 4 address counts showed constant growth for years prior, but since 2014, the IPv 4 count has stagnated while IPv 6 counts have grown. Thus, it seems we have entered an era marked by increased complexity, {{one in which the}} sole enumeration of <b>active</b> IPv 4 <b>addresses</b> is of little use to characterize recent growth of the Internet as a whole. With this observation in mind, we consider new points of view in the study of global IPv 4 address activity. Our analysis shows significant churn in active IPv 4 addresses: the set of <b>active</b> IPv 4 <b>addresses</b> varies by as much as 25 % {{over the course of a}} year. Second, by looking across the <b>active</b> <b>addresses</b> in a prefix, we are able to identify and attribute activity patterns to network restructurings, user behaviors, and, in particular, various address assignment practices. Third, by combining spatio-temporal measures of address utilization with measures of traffic volume, and sampling-based estimates of relative host counts, we present novel perspectives on worldwide IPv 4 address activity, including empirical observation of under-utilization in some areas, and complete utilization, or exhaustion, in others.
