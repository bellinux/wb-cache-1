5|$|Around {{one-third of}} people with {{psoriasis}} report {{a family history of}} the disease, and researchers have identified genetic loci associated with the condition.

These findings suggest both a genetic susceptibility and an environmental response in developing psoriasis.|$|E

40|$|In {{high-resolution}} {{x-ray diffraction}} sometimes a pronounced splitting {{of the strongest}} Bragg reflections in decagonal Al 70 Co 15 Ni 15 is observed. So far, this has been interpreted as evidence for <b>a</b> <b>twinned</b> (micro-) crystalline state with large lattice parameters. In the present paper we show that the metrics can be perfectly reproduced by modeling <b>a</b> <b>twinned</b> one-dimensional quasicrystal rather than <b>a</b> <b>twinned</b> three-dimensional crystalline phase. The split peak positions can easily be reproduced by application of a linear phason strain on the ideal decagonal quasicrystal and subsequent fivefold twinning. New high-resolution x-ray-diffraction data are used in this analysis. An anisotropic broadening of all investigated reflections leads us to suggest a nonlinear phason-strain component...|$|R
