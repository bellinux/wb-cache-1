40|$|Recently, the {{engraving}} of letters or a pattern on a product surface {{has received more}} attention especially in trying to satisfy the customer requirements. Half-piecing is <b>a</b> <b>protrusion</b> forming process that pierces only 40 ~ 50 % of the material thickness. In the current study, the half-piercing technique for making clear letters by protruding sheet material was selected and studied. The influence of clearance and penetration depth was investigated by measuring the camber and extruded length of <b>a</b> <b>protrusion</b> after experiments. In addition, a numerical analysis was performed for the same working conditions and compared with experimental results. It is shown that, as the clearance increases, the camber of <b>a</b> <b>protrusion</b> increases rapidly and the extruded length decreases slightly. The deformation pattern around the cutting edge during half-piercing changes from an extrusion mode to a shearing mode as the clearance changes from minus to plus values. It is also confirmed that th...|$|R

40|$|We {{simulate}} long self-avoiding chains using a weighted-biased sampling Monte-Carlo algorithm, and {{compute the}} probabilities for chain looping {{with and without}} <b>a</b> <b>protrusion.</b> We find that <b>a</b> <b>protrusion</b> {{near one of the}} chain's termini reduces the probability of looping, even for chains much longer than the protrusion-chain-terminus distance. This effect increases with protrusion size, and decreases with protrusion-terminus distance. We model the simulated results theoretically by considering how the protrusion "eclipses" the chain terminus closer to the protrusion from the more distant chain terminus. This eclipse mechanism has implications for understanding the regulatory role of proteins bound to DNA. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

25|$|Maxillary prognathism is <b>a</b> <b>protrusion</b> of the maxilla, and is {{a common}} feature in Sub Saharan Africans. Prognathism is less {{prevalent}} in East Asians and Caucasians. It {{is not to be}} confused with micrognathism, although combinations of both may be found. It affects the middle third of the face, causing it to jut out, thereby increasing the facial area, similar in phenotype of archaic hominids and apes. Mandibular prognathism is <b>a</b> <b>protrusion</b> of the mandible, affecting the lower third of the face. Alveolar prognathism is <b>a</b> <b>protrusion</b> of that portion of the maxilla where the teeth are located, in the dental lining of the upper jaw. Prognathism can also be used to describe ways that the maxillary and mandibular dental arches relate to one another, including malocclusion (where the upper and lower teeth do not align). When there is maxillary and/or alveolar prognathism which causes an alignment of the maxillary incisors significantly anterior to the lower teeth, the condition is called an overjet. When the reverse is the case, and the lower jaw extends forward beyond the upper, the condition is referred to as retrognathia (reverse overjet).|$|R
