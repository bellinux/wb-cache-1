5|$|Finn {{manages to}} steal the crown, hoping to sell it instead of Bartram. In town, however, the Destiny Gang steal the crown as well as Bartram. Finn, furious, riles up the town, who begin to riot, as they <b>are</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> being abused by the Destiny Gang. Finn goes to the Destiny Gang's mansion to confront their leader, Big Destiny. Once there, Big Destiny returns the crown, noting {{that it is the}} last {{possession}} that he will ever own. Finn looks out the window and sees that the gang is burning the city. Finn races to his home, taking Marceline with him. When he arrives at his house, the gang has already set it on fire with his parents and infant sibling trapped upstairs. Finn asks Marceline if the crown is magic and she tells him it is very dangerous magic. He then puts the crown on his head, and the power begins to flow through him.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{hardcore}} punk was developing primarily in Southern California and Washington, D.C. The New York hardcore scene {{was founded by}} 1981, and bands such as Reagan Youth and Kraut led the initial charge. By 1985, the New York hardcore scene had become inhabited by straight edgers and skinheads, including bands such as Agnostic Front, Cro-Mags, Heart Attack, Youth of Today, The Plasmatics, Warzone, and Murphy's Law. With {{the collapse of the}} CBGB hardcore matinees due to constant violence, a more activist DIY scene began to develop around ABC No Rio and the squats of the Lower East Side. New York has {{been at the center of}} the United States third wave ska scene. The founders of third wave ska, which drew on British Two-Tone ska, were New York bands such as the Toasters and Urban Blight. In the early 1980s, Toasters singer/guitarist and songwriter Robert 'Bucket' Hingley established Moon Ska Records; the label operated until the late 1990s, giving many ska bands from New York and elsewhere international exposure. Some of the other ska bands to come from the New York scene were Skinnerbox, The Slackers, and Mephiskapheles. Other major hardcore punk bands from New York <b>are</b> <b>Sick</b> <b>of</b> It All, H2O, and Madball. There are also ska-jazz bands, such as the New York Ska Jazz Ensemble.|$|E

500|$|According to The New York Times, Friends with Benefits, a film [...] "about {{love and}} {{sex in the}} age of social networking, gets some of its juice and tang partly by trash-talking its own genre. The setup is familiar, as are the {{essential}} elements: a single man and a single woman, two battered hearts yet a pair of resilient, eager, pretty bodies [...] Friends with Benefits starts from the premise that its characters, and you, <b>are</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> the romantic comedy clichés they may secretly, or not so secretly, adore." [...] Drew Pinsky, an addiction medicine specialist felt that the film's central characters, both of whom were raised by a single parent in the film, [...] "start looking for ways to solve that problem because they were never given the opportunity to grow an emotional landscape from a nurturing, available parent. They were just quickly parentalized and became a caretaker. And the caretaking is all part of the 'going for a broken person' and trying to fix them." [...] He further added that [...] "love addiction ending in 'happily ever after' is not a great message." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{development}} for Rust {{began as a}} clone of DayZ, a popular mod for ARMA 2, as well as featuring elements of Minecraft. Garry Newman, the CEO of Facepunch Studios, said [...] "Rust started off as a DayZ clone. But then {{we decided that we}} <b>are</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> fighting zombies. And can't compete with the Arma island in terms of landmarks and towns". Following its initial alpha launch, updates for Rust were released, adding mechanics such as animals, hunting, armor and weapons. In February 2014, zombies were removed from Rust and replaced with black bears and wolves. Early on in the development, the choice was made not to try to populate the world with interesting locations to explore, but rather give the players the ability to create such places. Newman described it as [...] "we give them the tools, they make the world".|$|E

In {{that this}} grace of God is here {{presented}} unto us {{under the terms of}} water of life, it is to show that some <b>are</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> that disease that nothing can cure but that. There are many diseases in the world, and there are also remedies for those diseases; but there is a disease that nothing will, can, or shall cure, but a dram of this bottle, a draught of this aquae vitae, this water of life. This is intimated by the invitation, 'let him take the water of life freely' (Rev 22:17). And again, 'I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely' (Rev 21:6). This is spoken to the sick, to them that <b>are</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> the disease that only Christ, as a physician, with his water of life, can cure (Mark 2:17). But few <b>are</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> this disease, but few {{know what it is to}} be made sick of this disease.[5] There is nothing can make sick of this disease but the law and sin, and nothing can cure but the grace of God by the gospel, called here the water of life.|$|E
