25|$|Spinning reels {{have two}} types of drag: front or rear. Front drags, which have the {{adjustment}} located on the spool itself, are mechanically simpler, usually more consistent in performance and capable of higher drag forces. Rear drags, with the <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> {{on the back of}} the reel, are more complicated mechanically and usually not as precise or smooth as front drags since the drag itself is often part of the drive shaft and not the spool. They are however, easier to adjust in mid-fight.|$|E
2500|$|... 2. The wider {{wing nut}} that sits {{underneath}} the center screw controls {{the placement of}} the lamp within the reflector. [...] Loosening this wing nut will free the lamp assembly from the cap housing. [...] The user can then push the entire <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> and lamp holder up, down, left or right to center the hot spot in the beam. [...] It is this adjustment that most commonly needs to be made with lights that haven't been regularly serviced. [...] Sometimes it is helpful to use a screwdriver or wrench or other thin tool to reach between the body of the light and the cap to push up on the lamp holder assembly and hold it in place while you tighten the wing nut back down.|$|E
2500|$|Kater built a {{reversible}} pendulum (shown at right) {{consisting of a}} brass bar with two opposing pivots made of short triangular [...] "knife" [...] blades (a) near either end. It could be swung from either pivot, with the knife blades supported on agate plates. Rather than make one pivot adjustable, he attached the pivots a meter apart and instead adjusted the periods with a moveable weight on the pendulum rod (b,c). In operation, the pendulum is hung {{in front of a}} precision clock, and the period timed, then turned upside down and the period timed again. The weight is adjusted with the <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> until the periods are equal. Then putting this period and the distance between the pivots into equation (1) gives the gravitational acceleration g very accurately.|$|E
50|$|Some rear, horizontal, {{forward-facing}} dropouts {{have small}} <b>adjustment</b> <b>screws</b> threaded through the very rear {{to aid in}} positioning the axle precisely.

50|$|Fine and ultra fine <b>adjustment</b> <b>screws</b> {{are often}} used in {{photonics}} applications as part of purchased equipment (i.e. mirror mounts) or built into lab made (home built) apparatus. Often, screws are purchased with matching bushings to be integrated into an experiment or commercial product once attained. Fine <b>adjustment</b> <b>screws</b> and mirror mounts are available as standard items from most companies that sell optics hardware.|$|R
2500|$|Most modern demand valves use a {{downstream}} {{rather than}} an upstream valve mechanism. In a downstream valve, the moving part of the valve opens {{in the same direction}} as the flow of gas and is kept closed by a spring. The usual form of downstream valve is a spring-loaded poppet with a hard elastomer seat sealing against an adjustable metal [...] "crown" [...] around the inlet orifice. The poppet is lifted away from the crown by a lever operated by the diaphragm. Two patterns are commonly used. One is the classic push-pull arrangement, where the actuating lever goes onto the end of the valve shaft and is held on by a nut. Any deflection of the lever is converted to an axial pull on the valve shaft, lifting the seat off the crown and allowing air to flow. The other is the barrel poppet arrangement, where the poppet is enclosed in a tube which crosses the regulator body and the lever operates through slots in the sides of the tube. The far end of the tube is accessible from the side of the casing and a spring tension <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> may be fitted for limited diver control of the cracking pressure. This arrangement also allows relatively simple pressure balancing of the second stage.|$|E
5000|$|A {{ruling pen}} {{contains}} ink in a slot between two flexible metal jaws, which are tapered to a point. It enables precise {{rendering of the}} thinnest lines. [...] The line width can be adjusted by an <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> connecting the jaws. The <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> can optionally have a number dial.|$|E
5000|$|The term fine <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> {{typically}} {{refers to}} screws with threads from 40-100 TPI (Threads Per Inch) (0.5mm to 0.2mm pitch) and ultra fine <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> {{has been used}} to refer to 100-508 TPI (0.2 mm to 0.05 mm pitch). Even though these are non-standard threads, both ISO metric screw thread designations and UNC designations have been used to call out thread dimensions and fit (class). A typical use for a fine <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> is in an optical mirror mount as an adjuster. Typically 80 TPI screws are used in mirror mounts. [...] Ultra fine adjuster screws are used in applications requiring extremely fine motion like laser alignment, fiber coupling.|$|E

50|$|A six-DOF NSM {{isolator}} typically uses three isolators {{stacked in}} series: a tilt-motion isolator {{on top of}} a horizontal-motion isolator {{on top of a}} vertical-motion isolator. Figure 3 shows a schematic of a vibration isolation system consisting of a weighted platform supported by a single six-DOF isolator incorporating the isolators of Figures 1 and 2. Flexures are used in place of the hinged bars shown in Figure 1. A tilt flexure serves as the tilt-motion isolator. A vertical-stiffness <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> is used to adjust the compression force on the negative-stiffness flexures thereby changing the vertical stiffness. A vertical load <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> is used to adjust for varying weight loads by raising or lowering the base of the support spring to keep the flexures in their straight, unbent operating positions.|$|E
50|$|The user is able {{to adjust}} {{pressure}} easily and rapidly to the exact degree needed for any given plate. One would bring the upper roll down to the plate by turning a single <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw.</b> The roll automatically reaches a perfect parallel position with the plate (blanket) surface. Then two end adjustment screws would be turned down to meet {{the top of the}} roll's bearing blocks. If the user needed to add pressure {{on one end of the}} roll, he could simply turn the appropriate <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw.</b> The user {{is able to}} release or reapply pressure at any time (without changing pressure adjustment) by merely raising or lowering a lever. This eliminates problems such as starting or removing paper or felts that do not run out completely from between the rolls.|$|E

50|$|The Gyromax is {{the trade}} name for an {{adjustable}} mass (or adjustable inertia) balance wheel used in Patek Philippe wristwatches. Instead of weight <b>adjustment</b> <b>screws</b> {{on the outside}} of the rim, as in traditional balances, the Gyromax has turnable weights recessed into the top of the rim. The advantages claimed for this design are that, without projecting weight screws, the diameter of the balance can be increased, giving it a larger moment of inertia, and that it has less air resistance.|$|R
5000|$|There are hybrid {{self-centering}} chucks {{that have}} <b>adjustment</b> <b>screws</b> {{that can be}} used to further improve the concentricity after the workpiece has been gripped by the scroll jaws. This feature is meant to combine the speed and ease of the scroll plate's self-centering with the run-out eliminating controllability of an independent-jaw chuck. The most commonly used name for this type is a brand name, Set-Tru. To avoid undue genericization of that brand name, suggestions for a generic name have included [...] "exact-adjust".|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a welding nozzle position manipulator. The manipulator consists of an angle support to which the remaining components of the device are attached either directly or indirectly. A pair of pivotal connections attach a weld nozzle holding link to the angle support and provide a two axis freedom of movement of the holding link {{with respect to the}} support angle. The manipulator is actuated by a pair of adjusting screws angularly mounted to the angle support. These screws contact a pair of tapered friction surfaces formed on the upper portion of the welding nozzle holding link. A spring positioned between the upper portions of the support angle and the holding link provides a constant bias engagement between the friction surfaces of the holding link and the <b>adjustment</b> <b>screws,</b> so as to firmly hold the link in position and to eliminate any free play in the adjustment mechanism. The angular relationships between the <b>adjustment</b> <b>screws,</b> the angle support and the tapered friction surfaces of the weld nozzle holding link provide a geometric arrangement which permits precision adjustment of the holding link with respect to the angle support and also provides a solid holding link mount which is resistant to movement from outside forces...|$|R

40|$|A simple, {{efficient}} and reusable fiber-to-chip interconnect is presented. The interconnect {{is based on}} a V-groove (wet- chemically etched) in silicon, combined with a loose-mode Si 3 N 4 -channel waveguide. The loose-mode waveguide is adiabatically tapered to the integrated optical (sensor) circuitry. This adiabatic taper enables the dimensions of both the integrated optical sensor circuitry and the loose- mode waveguide section to be designed independently. The coupling efficiency of the `plug-it-in' interconnect is tunable between zero and the maximum obtainable value by tightening two <b>adjustment</b> <b>screws.</b> Coupling efficiencies up to 60 % using TE-polarized light at wavelength of 632. 8 nm have been reproducibly measured...|$|R
