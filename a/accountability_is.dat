Results showed that when <b>accountability</b> <b>was</b> not enhanced, as predicted, assessors relied on extraneous performance information (exercises, personality evaluations) when making their overall ratings.

Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle similarly feels that the book delivered a message of anti-complacency, however believes that is does so by [...] "bemoaning the normality of the First World in the face of the horrors of the Third."

This abbreviated timetable was necessary in order to capitalize on the release of the feature film , which was released in May 2016. According to the official synopsis, a strange new character with the power to accurately predict the outcome of future events comes {{to the attention of the}} world. This power divides the heroes on how best to utilize the information, with Captain Marvel wanting to profile future crimes before they occur, and Iron Man believing that [...] "the punishment cannot come before the crime." [...] The situation reaches a turning point when it is predicted that one of the heroes will be the cause of major destruction, forcing the others to make a difficult decision. Bendis said, [...] "People's personal <b>accountability</b> <b>is</b> the theme of this one... from the way cops are acting on camera, to the way people talk to each other online."

When VHA concurred with our recommendations and submitted an action plan, VA medical facility directors {{did not take the}} necessary actions to comply with VHA’s program directives and policy changes." [...] In his spoken testimony, Griffin said that in [...] "three-fourths (of the VA facilities investigated for falsification of wait time data), we're pretty confident that it was knowingly and willingly happening, and we're pursuing those." [...] He also said he hopes to complete his office's investigations into possible criminal misconduct by the end of 2014. If his office finds criminal misconduct, it will then refer cases to U.S. attorneys for possible prosecution. Senator Richard Burr said that the [...] "culture that has developed at VA and the lack of management and <b>accountability</b> <b>is</b> simply reprehensible." [...] In his testimony, Secretary Bob McDonald apologized [...] "to all Veterans who experienced unacceptable delays in receiving care at the Phoenix facility, and across the country. We at VA are committed to fixing the problems and consistently providing the high quality care our Veterans have earned and deserve in order to improve their health and well-being."

40|$|Purpose: <b>Accountability</b> has <b>been</b> {{described}} as an institutional social practice to encourage stewardship reflection and as such {{it is a process}} that can be observed and reported upon. This paper describes observations of an accountability event, the Annual General Meeting (AGM), which has been largely absent from the literature. The method and results of empirical research as to how <b>accountability</b> <b>was</b> discharged in not-for-profit AGMs is provided. Methodology/Approach: The research utilised a critical ethnographic methodology to explore community-specific <b>accountability.</b> Findings: Sensemaking <b>was</b> identified as an important function of the meeting and accountability processes. Further, <b>accountability</b> <b>was</b> enhanced when not-for-profit entities adhered to foundational rules, provided opportunities for sensemaking, and was seen to be characterised by organisational transparency. Research limitations: This was a pilot study undertaken to develop the observation and coding model. Future research would include expanding this tool into AGMs of other organisational types. Originality: AGMs are required of many organisations, but they have seldom been researched. This paper provides an insight into the characteristics of sensemaking within meeting behaviours, and insights into the role of governors and organisational members in the discharge of accountability...|$|R
