5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Saint Padarn (or Paternus to use his Latin name), and almost nothing with <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> certainty; the {{earliest}} literary reference to him is by Rhygyfarch in about 1097.

5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{surviving}} documentation, {{it is difficult to}} attribute unsigned works from the period with <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> certainty. The origin of the Crucifix has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp was {{discovered}} on July 23, 1995 separately by Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp prior to it becoming naked-eye visible on Earth. Although predicting the maximum apparent brightness of new comets with <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> certainty is difficult, Hale–Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997. It was {{visible to the}} naked eye for a record 18months, twice as long as the previous record holder, the Great Comet of 1811. Accordingly, Hale–Bopp was dubbed the Great Comet of 1997.|$|E

5000|$|A {{special case}} exists in three dimensions, where a massless {{graviton}} does not propagate <b>any</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom. Here several ghost-free theories {{of a massive}} graviton, propagating two <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom, can be defined. In the case of topologically massive gravity one has the actionwith [...] the three-dimensional Planck mass. This is three-dimensional general relativity supplemented by a Chern-Simons-like term built out of the Christoffel symbols.|$|R
5|$|Physeterids and Kogiids {{consist of}} sperm whales. Sperm whales consist {{the largest and}} {{smallest}} odontocetes, and spend {{a large portion of}} their life hunting squid. P. macrocephalus spends most of its life in search of squid in the depths; these animals do not require <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> light at all, in fact, blind sperm whales have been caught in perfect health. The behaviour of Kogiids remains largely unknown, but, due to their small lungs, they are thought to hunt in the photic zone.|$|E
5|$|The care of {{offspring}} among amphibians {{has been}} little studied but, in general, the larger the number of eggs in a batch, the less {{likely it is that}} <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> parental care takes place. Nevertheless, it is estimated that in up to 20% of amphibian species, one or both adults play some role in the care of the young. Those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 1972, {{the men of}} Alpha Phi {{voted to}} admit women into their chapter. They alerted National Headquarters, and National Secretary Robert H. Rubin replied telling Alpha Phi not to {{administer}} <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> ritual until the issue could be discussed in person. When Rubin arrived at Rutgers on November 11, 1972, {{he learned that the}} first degree of ritual had been administered, which began formal probationary membership. Alpha Phi's charter was immediately revoked and their chapter was placed on suspension. On November 13, the former Alpha Phi chapter formally reorganized as Mu Upsilon Alpha. On October 7, 2007, Mu Upsilon Alpha became a chapter of Mu Beta Psi.|$|E

30|$|The {{number of}} elements, nodes, and <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom for a simply {{supported}} beam (pin/pin) and a beam with mixed boundary conditions (pin/clamped) are reported in Table 5. The LogFE formulation, in general, includes both nodal and internal <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom. Nodal <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom {{may be linked to}} the nodal <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom of other finite element elements, e.g. by continuity conditions. In contrast, internal <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom are not linked to <b>any</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom of other elements, and thus can be eliminated from the model by static condensation.|$|R

5|$|The Solar System is chaotic over million- and billion-year timescales, {{with the}} orbits of the planets open to {{long-term}} variations. One notable example of this chaos is the Neptune–Pluto system, which lies in a 3:2 orbital resonance. Although the resonance itself will remain stable, it becomes impossible to predict the position of Pluto with <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> accuracy more than 10–20million years (the Lyapunov time) into the future. Another example is Earth's axial tilt, which, due to friction raised within Earth's mantle by tidal interactions with the Moon (see below), will be incomputable at some point between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} stratum, fragmentary remains of round or {{elliptical}} buildings were discovered. The potsherds {{found in this}} layer date it to Early Bronze Age. In the third stratum large elliptical buildings, {{very similar to the}} structures uncovered in the third stratum in an excavation near Kiryat Ata, were exposed. An abundance of broken storage vessels, in their original place, were found there. This pottery indicates that the building should be ascribed to an early phase of Early Bronze Age. In the second stratum, sections of minor construction and a few potsherds from diverse periods were found. The potsherds could not be attributed with <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> certainty to the architectural remains. Early Bronze Age II, Intermediate Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age and the Roman period stand out among the periods, to which these sherds are ascribed. A tomb attributed to the Middle Bronze Age was found; it contained scant remains of human bones and a bronze spearhead with a socket. The corner of a building that probably dated to the Early Roman period was discovered close to the surface {{in the eastern part of}} the excavation area.|$|E

25|$|First {{described}} by Eastman in 1904, this species was found localized in present-day Colorado.

Numerical experiments showed that the EEC scheme has a decent computational cost, even though it's higher than that of the popularly used methods. It is also second order accurate. The ESRD scheme adds dissipation around shocks to avoid growing oscillations, and is stable, but only first-order accurate...|$|R

25|$|In this example, the {{key point}} is that the kinetic energy is {{quadratic}} in the velocity. The equipartition theorem shows that in thermal equilibrium, <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom (such as a component of the position or velocity of a particle) which appears only quadratically in the energy has an average energy of kBT and therefore contributes kB to the system's heat capacity.

The derivatives formulae for Chebyshev polynomials of third and fourth kinds <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> and <b>of</b> <b>any</b> order in terms of their corresponding Chebyshev polynomials are deduced as special cases. Some new reduction formulae for summing some terminating hypergeometric functions of unit argument are also deduced. As an application, and with the aid of the new introduced derivatives formulae, an algorithm for solving special sixth-order boundary value problems are implemented with the aid of applying Galerkin method. A numerical example is presented hoping to ascertain the validity and the applicability of the proposed algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Are there <b>any</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom on {{the black}} hole horizon? Using the `membrane paradigm' we can {{reproduce}} coarse-grained physics outside the hole by assuming a fictitious membrane just outside the horizon.
