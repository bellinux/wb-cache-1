Della Femina owned one-third, Travisano owned one-third, and the rest was distributed among two other partners whom they had known from DKG and had followed them to Ted Bates Advertising. Della Femina was chairman, and Travisano was vice-chairman and co-director of creative services. Their first account was for Squire, a company that made hairpieces, and they came up with an ad, [...] "Are you still combing your memories?" [...] In 1970, they won their first major account, for Blue Nun Wine, {{and came up with a}} campaign that used the talents of comics Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates why over 50 {{workers who}} {{qualified}} for ESL training {{did not participate}} in the EWP programs offered on-site at two garment factories in Canada. Findings are drawn from a research project commissioned by Levi Strauss & Co. (Canada) in 1990. Results indicate that <b>advertised</b> programs, <b>supervisor</b> resistance, production and income anxiety, domestic and social pressure are more likely to lead to "dropout" than limitations in the programs per se. The authors conclude if an EWP programs is to be effective, it must address not only the linguistic needs of the ESL workforce in a particular context, but its relationship to larger social and economic structures in the workplace and wider community...|$|R

Also, the reformist newspaper Shargh pointed out an announcement by Movahhedi Kermani, the official representative of the Supreme Leader in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, who was quoted as saying, [...] "vote for a person who keeps to the minimum in his advertisements and doesn't lavish," [...] which uniquely pointed to Ahmadinejad, whose supporters touted as being not wealthy.|$|R
40|$|When I {{was invited}} to teach a fourth year class at Zayed University in March 2008, I {{accepted}} with some trepidation as I am CEO of a small but busy <b>advertising</b> agency and <b>supervisor</b> of a healthcare events company. The three hour per week course was called COM 401 : Strategic Planning in PR/Advertising. The class included about 30 students, a number that had grown after an instructor departed and left a vacuum for several semesters. Although the class was called Strategic Planning in PR and Advertising, the textbook I was given was Project Planning, Scheduling 2 ̆ 6 Control by James P. Lewis, a book that I thought more suited to a Project Management Professional course. As a long term practitioner of both PR and advertising, I couldn’t reconcile {{the objectives of the}} course and the content of the book. I told the dean of communications that I would teach the course provided I could develop the coursework so it was more in tune with the kind of strategic planning associated with marketing. I promised I would show the presentations and accompanying handouts and assignments {{prior to the start of}} the class. Thus, I developed 12 weeks of course material and began teaching...|$|R
