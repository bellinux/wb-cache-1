500|$|Vannevar Bush {{was born}} in Everett, Massachusetts, on March 11, 1890, the third child and only son of Perry Bush, the local Universalist pastor, and his wife Emma Linwood (née Paine).

A popular student, he was vice president of his sophomore class, and president of his junior class. During his senior year, he managed the football team. He {{became a member of the}} Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, and dated Phoebe Clara Davis, who also came from Chelsea. Tufts allowed students to gain a master's degree in four years simultaneously with a bachelor's degree, so for his master's thesis, Bush invented and patented a [...] "profile tracer". This was a device for assisting surveyors that looked like <b>a</b> <b>lawn</b> <b>mower.</b> It had two bicycle wheels, and a pen that plotted the terrain over which it traveled. It was the first of a string of inventions. On graduation in 1913 he received both bachelor of science and master of science degrees.|$|E

500|$|Not all {{critics were}} {{impressed}} with the album. Blabbermouth.net reviewer Borivoj Krgin dismissively labeled the album as [...] "another failure on the band's part {{to take the initiative}} and reinvent themselves." [...] Krgin described King as [...] "the weaker and less inventive of the two main songwriters" [...] (King and Hanneman), feeling the album followed [...] "a familiar direction that almost always sounds tired and forced" [...] as a result of King being the album's main songwriter. Krgin also singled out Araya for criticism, and called the vocalist a [...] "hollow shell of his former self, boasting a singing style that is monotonous, devoid of creativity and at times virtually unlistenable." [...] Krgin awarded the record 6 out of 10, and ended the review by observing that [...] "Slayer's rapidly diminishing record sales (Diabolus In Musica has shifted less than 300,000 copies in the US compared to 600–700,000+) as a sign that the band is in dire need of a new lease on life." [...] The Washington Post gave it a mixed review, stating, [...] "Of course, what Slayer says isn't supposed to be nearly as important as how it says it: The riffs are all overdriven and suffocating, and that's a conscious decision. In its simplest form, a song like [...] "Exile" [...] could pass for Motorhead pushed through the blades of <b>a</b> <b>lawn</b> <b>mower,</b> but that's selling Slayer short; guitarist Kerry King actively fights the groove that naturally comes from playing heavy rock-and-roll." ...|$|E
