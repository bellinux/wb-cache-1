5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1970, partly as a {{response}} to criticism that they were not reaching their intended audience, the CTW conducted a poll of four urban neighborhoods in New York, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. The results of the poll were positive in three out of the four neighborhoods and confirmed the show's high viewership. Sesame Street's high ratings increased during its second season, and Nielsen reported high audience loyalty. Gerald S. Lesser, CTW's first advisory board chair, reported rumors about the show becoming a fad <b>among</b> <b>college</b> <b>students.</b> Its ratings steadily increased for the first five seasons, and Nielsen reported that Sesame Street had the highest ratings of any PBS program. In 1985, the Workshop estimated that 20% of its regular viewers consisted of adults.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{guidance}} of writer-editor Stan Lee and artists/co-plotters such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, Marvel began its own rise to prominence. With an innovation that changed the comic-book industry, The Fantastic Four #1 initiated a naturalistic style of superheroes with human failings, fears, and inner demons, who squabbled and worried about the likes of rent-money. In contrast to the straitlaced archetypes of superheroes at the time, this ushered in a revolution. With dynamic artwork by Kirby, Steve Ditko, Don Heck, and others complementing Lee's colorful, catchy prose, the new style became popular <b>among</b> <b>college</b> <b>students</b> who could identify with the angst and the irreverent nature of the characters such as Spider-Man, the X-Men and the Hulk during a time period of social upheaval {{and the rise of}} a youth counterculture.|$|E

25|$|The game's rise to {{popularity}} in the U.S. came during World War II, when it was introduced by soldiers from its birthplace in Cincinnati, Ohio to various military stations around the world.

After the war, veterans brought the game back home to the U.S., where due to the GI Bill it spread to and became popular <b>among</b> <b>college</b> <b>students</b> as well as in home games. It also remained widely popular in countries in which U.S. troops were stationed, both in WWII and later deployments.|$|E
25|$|Roguelike is a subgenre of {{role-playing}} video games, {{characterized by}} procedural generation of game levels, turn-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, permanent {{death of the}} player-character, and typically based on a high fantasy narrative setting.

25|$|Agreeableness is of {{fundamental}} importance to psychological well-being, predicting mental health, positive affect, and {{good relations with}} others. In both childhood and adolescence agreeableness has been tied to externalizing issues. Along with this {{it has also been}} implicated in outcomes to conflict management skills, school adjustment, peer-social status and self-esteem. Some work has been done looking into whether agreeableness levels through childhood have effects on adjustment and agreeableness into adulthood. Among young adults, individuals that have been diagnosed with either externalizing as well as internalizing disorders present lower levels of agreeableness and communion, and higher levels of negative emotionality, than those young adults without such disorders. Agreeableness also is reported to mediate links between anger and depression in young adults. <b>Among</b> <b>college</b> <b>students,</b> agreeableness is often associated with self-reports of emotional experience and control along with psycho-physiological responses to affectively charged stimuli. Across adulthood, low agreeableness {{has been found to be}} a health risk. High agreeableness, especially trust and honesty, has been linked to longevity.|$|E

40|$|Background: Smoking is {{the most}} {{important}} avoidable cause of premature morbidity and mortality in the world. The estimated annual death rate of 4. 9 million people in 1999 is expected to rise to 10 million by the 2020 s and 2030 s, 7 million of which will occur in developing countries. Aim: The aim {{of the present study was}} to estimate the prevalence of smoking and assess its pattern <b>among</b> non-medical female <b>college</b> <b>students</b> in Dammam, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted of 1020 female students selected from the literature and science colleges by multi-stage stratified random sampling technique with proportional allocation. Data were collected using a self-administered modified WHO Global Youth Tobacco Survey questionnaire. Results: Results revealed that occurrence of smoking <b>among</b> female <b>college</b> <b>students</b> was 8. 6 %. It was significantly higher <b>among</b> literature <b>college</b> <b>students</b> (12. 1 %) than <b>among</b> Science <b>College</b> <b>students</b> (3. 4 %). The mean age at which smoking started was 16 ± 2. 4 years, with a minimum of 11 years. More than half of the students who smoked were cigarette smokers, while 43. 2 % were shisha smokers. There was a strong relationship between parents who smoked and daughters who smoked. The main motive for smoking was curiosity (44. 3 %), followed by relief of tension (26. 1 %). Conclusions: It may be concluded that smoking is increasing <b>among</b> female <b>college</b> <b>students</b> in Saudi Arabia. Accordingly, it is recommended that a preventive comprehensive health education program on smoking be initiated for females in middle schools, that stricter tobacco control measures be adopted by the government, and that anti-smoking clinics be established in colleges...|$|R
