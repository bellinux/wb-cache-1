The St. Luke's and Faxton hospitals have a total of 370 acute and 202 long-term beds, and St. Elizabeth Medical Center has 201 acute-care beds. St. Luke's and Faxton are surgical centers, and St. Elizabeth is <b>a</b> <b>trauma</b> and surgical center. The Mohawk Valley Health System prefers to construct a new hospital in Downtown Utica by 2021, consolidating operations at the existing hospitals.|$|E
5|$|One way {{to advance}} {{emergency}} medical care is to obtain the recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty in countries that currently lack it. Without such recognition, {{it is difficult to}} set up training programs or recruit potential students, as they face the uncertainly of training to obtain a credential that may end up being useless to them. Recognition increases the visibility and prestige of the profession and promotes other efforts to advance its development. Botswana may serve as a case study. Its recent recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty has been closely accompanied by the creation of the Botswana Society for Emergency Care, the establishment of a Resuscitation Training Centre and <b>a</b> <b>Trauma</b> Research Centre at the University of Botswana, and the formation of a committee to design a national policy for pre-hospital care.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Post-traumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) {{is a major}} public health problem defined by three symptom clusters: intrusion thoughts, avoidance mechanisms and hyper-arousal. Several authors have emphasized, that {{some or all of}} these symptoms related to a past traumatic experience could be reactivated, even after long asymptomatic periods. This study investigates the role of <b>an</b> additional <b>trauma</b> in the reactivation of <b>a</b> childhood <b>trauma</b> among <b>a</b> group of former hidden children (n = 65), the Jewish youths who spent World War II in various hideaway shelters in Nazi-occupied Europe. They were compared with a control group. Method: The presence or absence of <b>an</b> additional <b>trauma</b> in adulthood was assessed and PTSD symptoms were measured by using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Results: An additional trauma reactivates PTSD symptoms of intrusion thoughts and, marginally, symptoms of hyper-arousal. At the opposite, symptoms of avoidance were not reactivated. Conclusion: Our results confirm the role of <b>an</b> additional <b>trauma</b> in the reactivation of traumatic memories, related to <b>an</b> earlier <b>trauma,</b> in later life. Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed and perspectives are proposed. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

25|$|Predictors of poor {{mental health}} after <b>a</b> <b>trauma,</b> such as mental health status prior to <b>a</b> <b>trauma</b> and {{individual}} characteristics, can help determine {{those who will}} be more vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Those that exhibit lower mental health prior to an earthquake {{will be more likely}} to experience negative life changes than positive life changes with regard to personal strength. Depressive symptoms before a disaster can predict higher chances of developing PTSD following <b>a</b> <b>trauma.</b> People who exhibit lower mental health prior to the trauma don't adapt as well following trauma, and show higher levels of PTSD. Personality traits, such as neuroticism and low self-control are associated with a lower sense of normalcy following an earthquake, however optimism is predictive of lower and less severe PTSD symptoms.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the gravity}} and {{intensity}} of hearing victims’ stories of abuse, professionals (social workers, police, counselors, therapists, advocates, medical professionals) are at risk themselves for secondary or vicarious trauma (VT), which causes the responder to experience trauma symptoms similar to the original victim after hearing about the victim’s experiences with abuse.

40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} if seemingly identical head and neck trauma would generate differing types of brain damage. We experimentally evaluated induced brain injuries immediately after trauma exposure, and at 1 week post-injury. Anesthetized rabbits were exposed once to a sagittal rotational acceleration head and neck injury at either a high or a low load level, using either flexion or extension. <b>A</b> high-load extension <b>trauma</b> induced scattered meningeal petechial hemorrhages and no deaths, in contrast to <b>a</b> flexion <b>trauma</b> of the same level, which resulted in extensive parenchymal and meningeal hemorrhages, and all animals succumbed immediately. <b>A</b> low-level flexion <b>trauma</b> induced scattered meningeal petechiae, but no gross damage, while extension at the same force generated no macroscopically visible acute brain injury. Immunohistochemical investigations carried out at 7 days disclosed that <b>a</b> low-level flexion <b>trauma,</b> as well as both low- and high-level extension exposures, all induced diffuse brain injuries in the cerebral cortex and white matter, corpus callosum, hippocampus, brainstem, and cerebellum, as revealed by abnormal distribution of neurofilaments, a prevalence of b-amyloid precursor protein, and astrogliosis. The diffuse brain injury seen after <b>a</b> low-level flexion <b>trauma</b> was equal to or more extensive than that seen after <b>a</b> high-level extension <b>trauma.</b> <b>A</b> low-level extension <b>trauma</b> induced only minor histopathological abnormalities. We conclude that a sagittal rotational acceleration trauma {{of the head and}} neck induced diffuse brain injury, and that flexion caused more extensive damage than extension at the same applied load...|$|R
