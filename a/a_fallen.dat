5|$|Collyer Monument is an {{historic}} monument to firefighters in Mineral Spring Park, {{at the corner}} of Mineral Spring Avenue and Main Street, in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, United States. The monument was built in 1890 by the sculptor Charles Parker Dowler to honor Samuel Smith Collyer, <b>a</b> <b>fallen</b> Pawtucket Fire Chief. The life-size bronze sculpture stands atop a pedestal of Westerly granite which contains a bronze plaque showing the fatal accident and the reverse bears the inscription. The Collyer Monument represents a significant example of monumental work of the period and an early example of local civic pride. The monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Ewiniar {{hammered}} Okinawa {{with heavy}} rain, creating mass confusion and troubles for tourists. Flights and ferries out of Okinawa to neighbouring islands were cancelled, {{and as many}} as 3,500 tourists were left stranded at various airports because most hotels were already near full capacity. Other tourists reportedly stayed in the homes of some Okinawa residents, while some residents in landslide-prone areas evacuated to higher ground. Seven people were injured in Nanjo from <b>a</b> <b>fallen</b> signboard, while an elderly woman in Nago City and a young girl in Yaese suffered wind-related injuries.|$|E

40|$|How does <b>a</b> <b>falling</b> cat {{change her}} {{orientation}} in midair without violating angular momentum constraint? This {{has become an}} interesting problem to both control engineers and roboticists. In this paper, we address this problem together with a constructive solution. First, we show that <b>a</b> <b>falling</b> cat problem {{is equivalent to the}} constructive nonlinear controllability problem. Thus, the same principle and algorithm used by <b>a</b> <b>falling</b> cat can be used for space robotic applications, such as reorientation of a satellite using rotors and attitude control of a space structure using internal motion, and other robotic tasks, such as dextrous manipulation with multifingered robotic hands and nonholonomic motion planning for mobile robots. Then, using ideas from Ritz Approximation Theory, we develop a simple algorithm for motion planning of <b>a</b> <b>falling</b> cat. Finally, we test the algorithm through simulation on two widely accepted models of <b>a</b> <b>falling</b> cat. It {{is interesting to note that}} one set of simulation results closely resembles the real trajectories employed by <b>a</b> <b>falling</b> cat...|$|R
5|$|Hospitalman Third Class (then Hospitalman) Phil Isadore Valdez, from New Mexico, was posthumously {{awarded the}} Navy Cross {{for his actions}} on January 29, 1967. On that date Valdez ran over seventy-five yards of open terrain, under {{constant}} enemy fire, to aid <b>a</b> <b>fallen</b> Marine. He then moved the wounded man to a safe area and, quickly and competently, rendered medical assistance. Again exposing himself to enemy fire, Valdez moved across approximately fifty yards of open ground to another Marine. While treating the second Marine, he positioned himself between {{the man and the}} hostile fire. It was at this time that Valdez was mortally wounded by enemy small-arms fire.|$|E
5|$|In Southaven, 40homes were flooded and 200were left {{homeless}} as {{a result}} of the heavy rainfall. A church undergoing construction in Calhoun County was damaged, and a street light in Lee County was snapped. Also, <b>a</b> <b>fallen</b> tree damaged a house in Itawamba County. One indirect fatality occurred in Jasper County from an automobile accident due to wet roads. An estimated 24,000customers lost electric power during the storm. After the storm, several fires were sparked due to downed electrical wires. In all, the weakening Hurricane Dennis left $2.6million (2005USD) in damage.|$|E

50|$|The {{climbing}} helmet is a {{piece of}} safety equipment that primarily protects the skull against falling debris (such as rocks or dropped pieces of protection) and impact forces during <b>a</b> <b>fall.</b> For example, if a lead climber allows the rope to wrap behind <b>an</b> ankle, <b>a</b> <b>fall</b> can flip the climber over and consequently impact the back of the head. Furthermore, any effects of pendulum from <b>a</b> <b>fall</b> that have not been compensated for by the belayer may also result in head injury to the climber. The risk of head injury to <b>a</b> <b>falling</b> climber can be further significantly mitigated by falling correctly.|$|R
5|$|It is {{reported}} that the worst damage occurred in Escambia and Monroe counties. In the Escambia County city of Atmore, 100 percent of the city's residents lost electric power for some {{a period of time}} during the hurricane. The strongest winds occurred in Escambia County, where gusts surpassed , leaving numerous structures damaged or destroyed as Dennis tracked through the western half of the county. One man in the county was injured by <b>a</b> <b>fallen</b> tree branch. Also, an unconfirmed tornado tore the roof off a home, forcing emergency workers to evacuate a man inside.|$|E
5|$|Off Kyūshū, a Maldives-registered {{car ferry}} capsized, killing one crew member. A train was derailed, {{possibly}} {{due to a}} tornado, injuring five people. On the island, an electrician in Fukuoka Prefecture died after an industrial container at his firm fell on top of him, crushing him. A glass entrance of a supermarket in Nobeoka broke on impact with flying debris, killing one person. Elsewhere in the prefecture, a 42-year-old man died in his bedroom when it was crushed, while an elderly woman farmer {{died when she was}} hit by <b>a</b> <b>fallen</b> tree outside a greenhouse.

In the southeastern portion of the state, power outages were reported, due to fallen trees and tree limbs. In addition, some roof shingles blown off in Maine and Massachusetts, while other houses were completely unroofed. Daisy caused moderate to severe damage in eastern New England. Total wind damage in New England was estimated to have reached $500,000.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{agreement between}} hospital staff on what constitutes <b>a</b> <b>fall</b> {{and should be}} recorded on an incident report, to identify factors that influence whether a scenario is classified as <b>a</b> <b>fall,</b> and to {{examine the effect of}} providing a definition of <b>a</b> <b>fall</b> on interrater agreement. DESIGN: Two interrater agreement trials with pre–postintervention design. SETTING: Seven hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred forty-six hospital staff (nursing 76 %, physiotherapy 14 %, occupational therapy, 6 %) working on participating wards over a 24 -hour period. MEASUREMENTS: Fourteen video scenarios were played before participants, who were asked whether they would classify each scenario as <b>a</b> <b>fall</b> and whether they would complete an incident report in that scenario. A definition of <b>a</b> <b>fall</b> was then provided and the video scenarios replayed. Two definitions were investigated; the World Health Organization definition and a custom definition. RESULTS: Consensus was not evident in five of the 14 scenarios examined. Falls onto surfaces higher than the ground {{were less likely to be}} recorded on incident reports. Hospital and ward type influenced whether a scenario was classified as <b>a</b> <b>fall.</b> Overall agreement in classifying scenarios as <b>a</b> <b>fall</b> was only marginally greater after provision of the definition in both phases, although neither had an effect on whether staff would complete an incident report. CONCLUSION: Disagreement between hospital staff in what constitutes <b>a</b> <b>fall</b> may contribute to inconsistent research findings in this field and is not meaningfully improved through provision of a definition...|$|R

5|$|The Western Ganga {{society in}} many ways {{reflected}} the emerging religious, political and cultural developments of those times. Women became active in local administration because Ganga kings distributed territorial responsibility to their queens such as the feudal queen Parabbaya-arasi of Kundattur and the queens of King Sripurusha, Butuga II and feudal king Permadi. Inheritance of fiscal and administrative responsibility by the son-in-law, the wife or by the daughter is evident. The position of prime minister of King Ereganga II and position of nalgavunda (local landlord) bestowed upon Jakkiabbe, the wife of <b>a</b> <b>fallen</b> hero are examples.

5|$|The plank {{road was}} {{operational}} for about 38 years when a major flood on June 1, 1889 washed out much of it. The flood also destroyed the canal at the creek's mouth. The same storm system caused the Johnstown Flood, which killed over 2200 people. The Cogan House Covered Bridge {{was the only}} one on Larrys Creek to survive the flood, as <b>a</b> <b>fallen</b> tree formed a protective dam just upstream.

5|$|The {{precursor}} to Beryl produced heavy rainfall in Cuba, causing flooding, mudslides and two deaths. Torrential rain also affected south Florida and the Bahamas. After forming, Beryl produced rough surf along the US southeastern coast, leaving one person from Folly Beach, South Carolina missing. Upon making landfall in Florida, the storm produced strong winds that left 38,000people without power. High rains alleviated drought conditions {{and put out}} wildfires along the storm's path. <b>A</b> <b>fallen</b> tree killed a man driving in Orangeburg County, South Carolina.
