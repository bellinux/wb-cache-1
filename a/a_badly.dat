5|$|Stela 61 is a late {{monument}} {{bearing the}} name Aj Took'. It is a stunted stela with <b>a</b> <b>badly</b> eroded portrait and a shortened date form that {{is equivalent to}} a date either in 899 or 909, probably the latter.|$|E
5|$|Stela T was {{dedicated}} in 692 {{by an unknown}} ruler. It is <b>a</b> <b>badly</b> eroded schist sculpture bearing mostly unreadable glyphs accompanying a poorly preserved figure. The stela is conservative in style, being similar to the much older StelaU.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Tokyopop {{licensed}} The One I Love for an English-language translation in North America, {{and published}} it in October 2004. Viz Media republished the manga in February 2015. The manga {{has also been}} translated into other languages. Reviewers have identified a few themes in the collection. They had a range of reactions to The One I Love: some considered it heartfelt entertainment, while others reviewed it less positively, as <b>a</b> <b>badly</b> done take on romance.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>badly</b> wounded Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) {{returns to}} camp {{and tells the}} others about Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), and that other people live on the island, besides the plane {{survivors}}. Locke looks on from the shadows with his arms crossed. Hurley reveals to Jack {{that one of the}} survivors is not listed on the flight manifest, which means that someone was already on the island when the plane crashed. Claire's contractions begin to stop. Claire and Charlie are then met by Ethan, who looks at them ominously.|$|E
5|$|Billy and Stu {{discuss their}} plan to kill Sidney and frame the murder spree on her father, {{whom they have}} taken hostage. The pair also reveal that they, not Cotton, murdered her mother, Maureen, as she {{was having an affair}} with Billy's father, which drove his mother away. Gale, who survived the crash, intervenes, and Sidney takes {{advantage}} of this to turn the tables on her attackers, killing Stu. Randy is revealed to be wounded but alive. Billy attacks Sidney but she shoots him through the head, killing him. As the sun rises and police arrive, <b>a</b> <b>badly</b> injured Dewey is taken away by ambulance and Gale makes an impromptu news report about the night's events.|$|E

5|$|For the Coalition, the Russians were secure on {{the north}} bank of the Danube, {{awaiting}} reinforcements from Galicia; the bridges between Linz and Vienna had been destroyed, making French access to the Austrian capital more difficult, but not impossible. After six months of fighting in which the Austrians had enjoyed little good news, the Coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory. The French had retreated from the field with <b>a</b> <b>badly</b> mauled division and Kutuzov had secured the right flank. Indeed, Francis was so pleased with the outcome at Dürenstein that he awarded Kutuzov the Military Order of Maria Theresa.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of August 15 the Russian forces resumed their attacks on the Polish lines, {{intending}} to break through the second line of defences to the area of Nieporęt and Jabłonna. However, as they bypassed a small forest outside Wólka Radzymińska, they were assaulted from the rear by the 1st Battalion of the 28th Infantry Regiment, which had been concealed there earlier. Simultaneously, the remainder of the 28th Regiment began <b>a</b> <b>badly</b> coordinated and half-hearted attack from Nieporęt. Both Polish assaults were bloodily repelled, with the casualties including Lieutenant Pogonowski who was posthumously awarded the Virtuti Militari medal for his bravery leading the charge, but they did force the Russians to retreat to their initial positions.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{physician}} Antaak and <b>a</b> <b>badly</b> beaten Doctor Phlox update General K'Vagh {{on their}} progress. K'Vagh contacts Admiral Krell, who {{tells him that}} if a cure is not completed soon, the facility will be eradicated in order to contain the disease. Back on Enterprise, Archer questions Reed about his recent actions, and is contacted by Harris from Section 31, a secretive agency within Starfleet. Harris reveals that Phlox is on an important mission and little else, but Reed reveals his location as Qu'Vat; Harris contacts Krell, to inform him that Enterprise is on the way, and Krell reveals that he used Harris. Enterprise arrives at the colony, and Archer beams down to the base with Marab to confront the Klingons and Phlox.|$|E

5|$|Stela 5 is {{reasonably}} well preserved and is inscribed with two Long Count dates flanked by representations of two standing figures portraying rulers. The latest {{of these two}} dates is AD126. The right-hand figure is holding a snake, while the left-hand figure is holding what is probably a jaguar. This monument probably represents one ruler passing power to the next. A small seated figure is carved onto each of the sides of this stela along with <b>a</b> <b>badly</b> eroded hieroglyphic inscription. The style is early Maya and has affinities with sculptures at Izapa.|$|E
5|$|Ten were honoured {{for their}} role in the operation, seven {{receiving}} Distinguished Service Medals, two the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal and one, the grievously wounded Ritchie, the Victoria Cross. Ritchie had not initially been recommended for this award; the recommendation being submitted at a later date by an unidentified figure in the Admiralty. Snelling speculates that the Admiralty's change of heart was possibly a morale boosting measure, although Ritchie's courage during the action was never called into question. The shrapnel and bullet wounds he sustained in the raid were extensive, including injuries to his forehead, left thumb, left arm (twice), right arm, right hip and <b>a</b> <b>badly</b> broken right leg after being hit by two large calibre machine gun bullets.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the chief}} {{architectural}} concerns {{for the design of}} venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety. The speed at which the venue can be emptied is important both for amenity and safety because large crowds take a very long time to disperse from <b>a</b> <b>badly</b> designed venue and this in turn creates a safety risk. The Hillsborough disaster {{is an example of how}} poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. Sightlines and acoustics are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues.|$|E

5|$|When the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia commenced on 6 April 1941, only eight IK-2s were serviceable. One had been damaged in a landing accident, two {{were at the}} workshops in Zagreb being repaired, and the fourth unserviceable machine was in <b>a</b> <b>badly</b> damaged condition at Bosanski Aleksandrovac. That day and the next, the 107th Fighter Squadron patrolled over Bosnia but did not make any contact with the enemy. Two machines conducted a combat air patrol over the airfield of the 8th Bomber Regiment at Nova Topola. This pattern continued the following day without incident, but patrol duration and coverage was limited by the short range of the aircraft. On 8 April, a patrol unsuccessfully gave chase to a lone German reconnaissance aircraft, {{and later in the}} day, one of the IK-2s force landed, leaving seven operational aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Zoe Tapper as Dr. Anya Raczynski. Anya was {{a doctor}} in a busy city {{hospital}} when the virus struck and watched hundreds of patients die of the virus, including her friend and lover Patricia Kelly, and Patricia's flatmate Jenny Walsh. After treating <b>a</b> <b>badly</b> wounded Tom on the road, she joins the group. She privately discloses that, {{in the face of}} the pandemic, her faith in practicing medicine was deeply shaken, and she had initially sought to kill herself. Only later does she regain her confidence to successfully deliver a breech birth infant.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Murphy's distress call, a quick reaction force team assembles, boards two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, and {{heads toward the}} location without gunship escort seeking to extract the remaining members of the reconnaissance and surveillance team. During an attempt to insert the arriving forces, the Taliban insurgents shoot {{down one of the}} helicopters, killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators who were on board. The second helicopter is forced to turn back. After witnessing the attack, Luttrell and <b>a</b> <b>badly</b> injured Axelson are left behind. Axelson attempts to find cover, but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to attack several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the Taliban, one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact causes him to land {{at the bottom of a}} rock crevice where he is able to hide from the Taliban fighters.|$|E
