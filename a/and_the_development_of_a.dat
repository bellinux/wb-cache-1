This group investigated the forty existing engineering experiment stations at universities around the country, and a report was compiled by Harold Bunger, Montgomery Knight, and Vaughan in December 1929. Their report noted that several similar organizations had been opened across the country at other engineering schools and were successful in local economic development.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century the {{population}} and physical extent of London grew greatly. The increasing resident population <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> commuting population arriving by train each day led to a high level of traffic congestion with huge numbers of carts, cabs, and omnibuses filling the roads and up to 200,000 people entering the City of London, the commercial heart, each day on foot. By 1850 there were seven railway termini around the urban centre of London: London Bridge and Waterloo to the south, Shoreditch and Fenchurch Street to the east, Euston and King's Cross to the north, and Paddington to the west. Only Fenchurch Street station was within the City.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the relationship between coparenting, temperament, emotional understanding <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> externalizing <b>and</b> internalizing problems. Data from 240 families were used to determine if coparenting moderated <b>and</b> mediated <b>the</b> relationship between temperament <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> behavior problems, as well as if emotional understanding mediated the relationship between coparenting <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> behavior problems. Analyses found that lower levels of coparenting conflict <b>and</b> triangulation moderated <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> problem behaviors in children with difficult temperaments more so than higher levels of coparenting conflict and triangulation. Furthermore, coparenting conflict partially mediated the relationship between temperament <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> internalizing <b>and</b> externalizing problems. Emotional understanding, on the other hand, was not significantly correlated with coparenting or <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> behavior problems after controlling for the child‟s age. Findings highlight how child characteristics can interact with family dynamics to increase or decrease <b>the</b> likelihood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> behavior problems...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the 2005 education reform, Hurricane Katrina, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> charter schools in New Orleans, Louisiana. The education reforms were established in November 2005, three months after the storm, with the enactment of the Louisiana Recovery School District Law, Act No. 35, First Extraordinary Session, 2005, House Bill No. 121. The study answered three questions pertaining to the variables that follow: {{the relationship between the}} 2005 education reform <b>and</b> Hurricane Katrina, <b>the</b> relationship between the 2005 education reform <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> charter schools, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> relationship between Hurricane Katrina <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> charter schools. Respondents to the survey were comprised of 312 adults, ages 18 years old or older. The conclusions drawn from the findings indicated that there was not a statistically significant relationship between the variables, 2005 education reform and Hurricane Katrina, and Hurricane Katrina <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> charter schools in New Orleans. However, the findings also revealed that there was a statistically significant relationship between the two variables, 2005 education reform <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> charter schools in New Orleans...|$|R

5|$|Studies of {{the brain}} became more {{sophisticated}} {{with the use of}} the microscope <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> silver staining method by Camillo Golgi during the 1870s. This was able to show the intricate structures of single neurons. This was used by Santiago Ramón y Cajal and led to the formation of the neuron doctrine, the then revolutionary hypothesis that the neuron is the functional unit {{of the brain}}. He used microscopy to uncover many cell types, and proposed functions for the cells he saw. For this, Golgi and Cajal are considered the founders of twentieth century neuroscience, both sharing the Nobel prize in 1906 for their studies and discoveries in this field.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on July10. Once {{north of the}} Greater Antilles, convective growth <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> well-defined surface low {{led to the formation}} of a tropical depression just south of Acklins Island by 06:00UTC on July22. Amid a brief reprieve in strong upper-level winds, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bonnie as it crossed Ragged Island around 23:15UTC that day. It later traversed Andros Island at peak intensity, with sustained winds of 45mph (75km/h), and weakened slightly before moving ashore near Elliott Key, Florida, with winds of 40mph (65km/h) on July23. Bonnie weakened to a tropical depression as it crossed South Florida, and the persistent effects of strong wind shear prevented intensification in the Gulf of Mexico. The cyclone degenerated into a remnant low by 00:00UTC on July25 and later moved into southeastern Louisiana before dissipating later that day.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the bad {{conditions}} and high casualties amongst the Anzac troops {{resulted in a}} reasonably prevalent view in Australia that these had been due to the incompetence of British officers commanding the Australian troops and their disregard for the casualties that resulted from poorly planned or ill-conceived attacks. Whether these claims are valid or not, {{there can be little}} doubt that the entire campaign was poorly conducted, and as a result there were many military lessons learnt that were to be applied in later campaigns. Despite this, for Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign has come to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sense of national identity. Today, the date of the initial landings, 25 April, is a public holiday known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations, and indeed in Turkey, to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original Anzacs, and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war.|$|E

5|$|As deaf {{education}} and sign language research continued to evolve, {{so did the}} perception of ASL. With {{the publication of the}} Dictionary of American Sign Language, ASL began to be recognized as a legitimate language. The greater acceptance of ASL as a language led to standardization <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prestige dialect, which was based upon the signs used at Gallaudet University. Despite this standardization, ASL has regional, distinct accents similar to those of spoken languages. Dialects that are different from the standard one, and especially those spoken by marginalized groups, are often stigmatized. As a non-standard dialect, BASL is stigmatized by signers and considered to be inferior to prestige dialects of ASL. This difference in prestige has led BASL speakers to code switch to a prestige dialect when speaking with different groups of people, despite BASL being mutually intelligible with other dialects of ASL.|$|E
5|$|The {{deepening}} {{economic crisis}} caused a marked deterioration in {{quality of life}} of ordinary citizens and resulted in increasing political instability. Rationing and queuing became a way of life, with ration cards (kartki) necessary to buy basic consumer staples. The ration cards were utilized by the government in order to avoid allowing market regulation of income and prices and thus risking social unrest. As Western institutions were no longer willing to extend credit policies to the de facto bankrupt Polish government, access to goods the Poles needed became even more restricted. Most of the available scarce resources of Western currency had to be used to pay the crushing rates on Poland's foreign debt, which reached US$27 billion by 1980 and increased to US$45 billion in 1989. The government, which controlled all official foreign trade, responded by continuing to maintain a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing black market <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shortage economy. The omnipresent and destructive underground economy was characterized by phenomena such as bribery, waiting lists, speculation, direct exchanges between enterprises and large percentages of personal incomes deriving from secondary activities. Societal degradation was accompanied by unprecedented deterioration in the areas of biological environment and physical and mental health, which included steadily increasing mortality rates. In the late 1980s, the PZPR feared another social explosion because of high inflation, depressed living standards and deepening public anger and frustration. The authorities themselves, facing an increasingly disorderly and unmanageable system, felt perplexed and powerless.|$|E
