50|$|The {{martial eagle}} {{is a very}} large eagle. In total length, it can range from 78 to 96 cm, with an average of {{approximately}} 85.5 cm. Its total length - in comparison to its wingspan - is restricted by its relatively short tail. Nonetheless, it appears to be the sixth or seventh longest living eagle species. The wingspan of martial eagles can range from 188 to 260 cm. Average wingspans have been claimed of 205 cm and 207.5 cm for the species, however ten measured martial eagles in the wild were found to average 211.9 cm in wingspan. Thus, the martial eagle appears to average fourth in wingspan among living eagles, behind only the Steller's sea-eagle (Haliaeetus pelagicus), the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) and the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax), in roughly that order. For a species that is fairly homogeneous in its genetic make-up, the body mass of martial eagles is surprisingly variable. To some extent, the variation of body masses in the species is contributable to considerable reverse sexual dimorphism as well as varying environmental conditions of various eagle populations. Unsexed martial eagles from various studies have been found to have weighed an average of 3.93 kg in 17 birds, 3.97 kg in 20 birds and 4.23 kg in 20 birds while the average weight of martial eagles shot by game wardens in the early 20th century in South Africa was listed as 4.71 kg. In weight range, the martial eagle broadly overlaps in size with the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) and Verreaux's eagle (and is even exceeded by them in maximum known body mass). Based on numerous studies, the martial eagle appear to average mildly heavier than the Verreaux's eagle but (derived from the globally combined body mass of its various races), the mean body masses of golden and martial eagles are identical at approximately 4.17 kg. The renders the golden and martial eagles <b>as</b> <b>tied</b> <b>as</b> the largest African eagles (by body mass but not in total length or wingspan, in which the martial bests the golden), as well as the heaviest two species of booted eagle in the world and <b>as</b> <b>tied</b> <b>as</b> the sixth heaviest eagles in the world, after the three largest species of sea eagle (Steller's being the heaviest extant, the others ranking 4th and 5th), the harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and the Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi). The longest African eagle (and second longest booted eagle after the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax)) is the crowned eagle by virtue of its relatively longer tail, as its body weight is slightly less than these three heaviest booted eagle species.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{determinants}} of Japanese attitudes toward acceptance of foreigners. It specifically focuses on the effects of education on xenophobia, and investigates which of the competing theories-labor market competition theory or contact theory- better accounts for the educational effects on attitudes toward foreigners. Analyzing the subsample of those currently employed, the results from logistic regression suggest that age, ratio of foreign residents in the prefecture, and economic threat are positively associated with xenophobia, whereas education, the ratio of Korean residents in the prefecture, and several contact factors are positively associated with pro-foreign attitudes. Although the results indicate that both the dynamics of labor market competition and contact with foreigners are crucial determinants, the effects of education on xenophobia act through the latter rather than the former. The study finds that contact theory provides a better explanation of xenophobia than labor market theory, and suggests that close personal contacts with foreigners such <b>as</b> family <b>ties</b> <b>as</b> well as friendship in neighborhood and workplace are important to promote positive attitudes toward foreigners...|$|R
