25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a loner). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of social interaction, while solitude is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or {{in the middle of a}} crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own sweet spot of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or over-stimulation.|$|E
500|$|For the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990, Madonna said, [...] "I {{wanted to}} throw an old song for fun, and 'Holiday' {{seemed to be}} a {{universal}} favourite. In addition to that it's one of the only old songs I've done that I can still sing <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> I've totally outgrown it." [...] Performing it {{as a part of the}} encore, Madonna appeared on the stage in a polka-dotted blouse with matching flounces at the bottom of white trousers and hair in a top knot with a ponytail. The costume was adopted from a My Fair Lady dress and was designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier. Three different performances are found in the Blond Ambition: Japan Tour 90 VHS, the Blond Ambition World Tour Live VHS and the [...] documentary. The performance included in the documentary was used as a music video to promote it. The performance received four nominations at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Female Video, Best Dance Video, Best Choreography in Video and Best Cinematography in Video, but did not win any of the categories.|$|E
500|$|As a young teenager, Hill {{climbed in}} {{southern}} California, primarily in Joshua Tree National Park. She earned money for day trips {{out to the}} park by working at a Carl's Jr. Bludworth initially taught her climbing culture; he subscribed to magazines and read books which Hill then devoured. She was influenced in particular by Yvon Chouinard's ethic of [...] "leaving no trace" [...] on the rock. Moreover, the climbing of Beverly Johnson captured her imagination, particularly Johnson's 10-day solo of Dihedral Wall on El Capitan. As Hill explains in her autobiography, [...] "I was awed, but not just by the know-how and hard work she'd put into her ascent. It was the courage and confidence that it took to put herself on the line, to do something on the cutting edge—to climb one of the world's greatest big walls {{in one of the}} most challenging ways possible: solo. She had succeeded and she'd given women climbers like me enormous confidence to be ourselves <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> limited by being a minority in a male-dominated sport." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the third}} match, in Bridgetown, Barbados, Boycott was to face what was later {{said to be}} Holding's {{greatest}} over. Boycott was hit on the gloves by the first delivery, played-and-missed the second outside off stump, was hit on the thigh by the third, fended the next two deliveries away with his bat, and was then bowled by the final delivery. Though in 1987 Boycott would claim a 1966 delivery by Gary Sobers {{to be the best}} he ever faced in cricket, he noted of Holding's over that [...] "for {{the first time in my}} life I can look at a scoreboard with a duck against my name <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> a profound sense of failure." [...] Boycott led an England fight back in the fourth Test. Having watched Holding's over several times on video, and worked in the nets on his game, Boycott came out and made 38 in the first innings and then hit his twentieth Test century. His career run total was now 7,410, gaining on Gary Sobers' record of 8,032.|$|E
500|$|Austin {{joined the}} cast as Wilkes in October 2015. Wilkes, who {{originates}} from the comics, {{was changed to}} a black character for the series, which allowed the series to address racism during the 1940s. On {{the race of the}} character, Austin said [...] "it does play a factor. It can’t not, really. It’s Los Angeles—or , America—in 1947. So race does play a factor". Butters added, [...] "We wanted to tell a rich story around [...] <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> like you’re preaching about it, you know, 'Racism is not good.'" [...] For when the character becomes intangible following exposure to Zero Matter, the series' science adviser theoretical physicist Clifford Johnson explained that the substance introduces the idea of moving in [...] "another direction" [...] from what is usually possible, and so Wilkes's intangibility is actually the Zero Matter taking him [...] "somewhat off, towards the place it came from" [...] in another dimension. Austin noted that this experience causes both fear and curiosity in Wilkes, and forces his role in the series to be more cerebral rather than action-focused as he is relegated to explaining science and planning until he regains his tangibility.|$|E
500|$|The drug itself, lithium, is {{typically}} {{used as a}} mood stabilizer to prevent acute manic behavior in patients with bipolar disorder. Lee chose the title as a [...] "metaphor for happiness from a negative point of view": [...] "It's looking at it like, 'I don't want to numb myself <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> anymore'." [...] She explained that during her process of writing music, she would get into a mood or a [...] "strange low that I ride" [...] that she would try to overcome by telling herself {{to let go of}} certain things, change and rejoice again; such experiences also inspired her to write [...] "Lithium". Initially, Lee was indecisive as to which song to choose as the second single from The Open Door, having in mind four different album tracks. [...] "Lithium" [...] was eventually chosen and made available for digital download on December 4, 2006. It was physically released in the United Kingdom on January 8, 2007. [...] "The Last Song I'm Wasting on You", a track originally written for The Open Door and later included as a bonus track on several editions of the album, was the single's B-side.|$|E

500|$|The single reel film, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on January 31, 1911. The Billboard praised Marie Eline's acting also noting the good photography in its review. The Moving Picture Worlds review states, [...] "The part played by the grandmother and the one played by the child are both pathetic and cannot fail to touch the heart. The person who can sit through this <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> the tears welling up to his eyes is strangely callous to human grief and emotion." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was open in its praise of the film and its portrayal of the subject through good acting, but it also noted the technical faults with film continuity. The reviewer wrote, [...] "It was noticed that the old lady's bag was brought on immediately, already packed, {{when she left the}} son's house and when she left the home. It looks planned beforehand – similar incidents have hurt the excellence of a number of this company's superior films. It would take time in life, and a split in the film would have done it. Such things spoil the illusion to a spectator." ...|$|E
500|$|The Dragon Quest Slime has {{received}} positive reception from critics and fans, {{being called the}} [...] "most prolific" [...] of all the [...] "memorable" [...] monsters from the series {{and is one of}} the most recognizable characters in gaming. The Slime has also been called cute and charming by several critics, especially when reviewing Rocket Slime. GamesRadar listed it as the most lovable blob in video games, calling them the [...] "equivalent of training wheels" [...] due to how easy they are to defeat typically, but also saying that their weird smile makes players think twice about killing them. They also listed it as a character they wished they knew less about. They stated that while they started out as nothing more than things for players to kill <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> guilty about, the playable role of a Slime in the [...] series made them realize they were more than just generic enemies. In the January 2010 issue of Nintendo Power, the editors listed the Slime among its Favorite Punching Bags, a list including Goombas and Octoroks. They wrote that [...] "The Slimes are just so cute and friendly-looking, it's almost hard to slay them. But you know, a hero's gotta do what a hero's gotta do." ...|$|E
500|$|Andy Kellman from AllMusic {{wrote in}} his review that #1's was {{formatted}} the same was as other music scores and anthologies packed for the holiday shopping season. He further commented that its title should have been different and concluded, [...] "the disc reaffirms that Destiny's Child released {{some of the biggest}} R singles of the late '90s and early 2000s." [...] Slant Magazine Sal Cinquemani criticized the album's title as only four of the singles reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. However, he praised Destiny's Child's [...] "impressive output, which includes some of the most recognizable R hits of the past bling/celly/status-obsessed five years". BBC Online's writer James Blake called the album [...] "more than decent" [...] and added that the group's success in the music industry was a notable reason for a greatest hits release. However, he argued that it was very soon to include songs from their final studio album, Destiny Fulfilled, as it was released only eleven months before #1's. Pitchfork Media's Jess Harvell felt that it was a [...] "smart" [...] move not to arrange the songs on the compilation in a chronological order and felt it [...] "has the odd knock-on effect of suggesting that their legacy may be based on a smaller body of work than imagined". Harvell finished the review by writing, [...] "you can take #1's as pure product <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> wrong for doing so". Despite classifying its title as [...] "misleading" [...] and criticizing the new material, Houston Chronicles editor Michael D. Clark wrote the album was [...] "dolled up as beautiful and immaculate as" [...] the members of the group and included their best singles from their four studio albums.|$|E

2500|$|Jonathan Raban, {{highlighting}} many of {{the virtues}} that have been ascribed to Updike's prose, called Rabbit at Rest [...] "one {{of the very few}} modern novels in English... that one can set beside the work of Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, Joyce, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> the draft...

2500|$|The {{computer}} animation {{used throughout the}} film was more complex than anything DreamWorks had done before. When the head of production handed the script to VFX Supervisor Markus Manninen, she reportedly laughed and wished him [...] "good luck". [...] "When we started talking," [...] said Manninen, [...] "the movie was still a high concept. But for everyone that looked at it, it screamed complexity. We launched off saying, how can you make this movie tangible? How can you find smart ways to bring this world to life {{in a way that}} makes it a great movie <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> like the complexity becomes the driver of the story, but the story and the emotion being the driver?"

2500|$|In reality, Smith was {{discontent with}} only a few colonists who acted this way; he [...] "claimed the early colonists were heroes. His primary purpose in writing The Generall Historie...was to eternalise 'the memory of those that effected' the {{settlement}} of Virginia". Smith {{goes so far as to}} compare the colonists to Adam and Eve in A Description of New England (1616). Just as Adam and Eve spread productivity throughout the world, so the colonists created life in the Virginia colony. Smith essentially sympathized with gentlemen; he knew that it was not their fault that they were useless and that this trait was merely a product of the imposed standards of English society. He recognized that [...] "they were imprisoned by their own self-imposed limitations. What they could and could not do was decided by their awareness of traditional roles and by the shame that they would feel if others saw them engaged in physical work". Lemay suggests that, as a result of Smith's strict rules and the emigration to America, these men could shed these roles and create new lives for themselves in which they could celebrate the products of their labours <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> humiliated.|$|E

2500|$|Anthony Nutting {{recalled}} that Eden told him, [...] "What's all this nonsense about isolating Nasser or 'neutralising' him {{as you call}} it? I want him destroyed, can't you understand? I want him murdered, and if you and the Foreign Office don't agree, then you'd better come to the cabinet and explain why." [...] When Nutting pointed out {{that they had no}} alternative government to replace Nasser, Eden apparently replied, [...] "I don't give a damn if there's anarchy and chaos in Egypt." [...] At a private meeting at Downing Street on 16 October 1956 Eden showed several ministers a plan, submitted two days earlier by the French. Israel would invade Egypt, Britain and France would give an ultimatum telling both sides to stop and, when one refused, send in forces to enforce the ultimatum, separate the two sides – and occupy the Canal and get rid of Nasser. When Nutting suggested the Americans should be consulted Eden replied, [...] "I will not bring the Americans into this ... Dulles has done enough damage as it is. This {{has nothing to do with}} the Americans. We and the French must decide what to do and we alone." [...] Eden openly admitted his view of the crisis was shaped by his experiences in the two world wars, writing, [...] "We are all marked to some extent by the stamp of our generation, mine is that of the assassination in Sarajevo and all that flowed from it. It is impossible to read the record now <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> that we had a responsibility for always being a lap behind ... Always a lap behind, a fatal lap." ...|$|E
