In these writings he plays the role of heavenly interlocutor delivering knowledge <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> messianic age.|$|E
25|$|Much of Iranian {{society was}} in {{euphoria}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> revolution.

While it was increasingly clear to more secular Iranians that Khomeini was not a liberal, he was widely perceived as a figurehead, and that power would eventually be handed to the secular groups.|$|E

25|$|The {{synoptic}} gospels represent Jesus as an exorcist and healer who preached in parables <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> Kingdom of God. He preached {{first in}} Galilee {{and later in}} Jerusalem, where he cleansed the temple. He states that he offers no sign as proof (Mark) or only the sign of Jonah (Matthew and Luke). In Mark, apparently written with a Roman audience in mind, Jesus is a heroic man of action, given to powerful emotions, including agony. In Matthew, apparently written for a Jewish audience, Jesus is repeatedly called out as the fulfillment of Hebrew prophecy.|$|E
25|$|The Farm Maps {{also make}} clear {{why so many}} {{property}} owners were distraught <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> of the grid, and why some of them tried to stop Randel and his crew from completing their work.

No wonder people fought back against the Commissioners' Plan, or set their dogs on Randel and his men.|$|E

25|$|Following {{his arrival}} in Greece, he settled down in Nafplio in 1833, {{at the time the}} capital of the newly formed Greek State. There he started a {{political}} career and began writing his first poems. In 1830, he was appointed secretary of the senate by Ioannis Kapodistrias. However, he soon objected to his practices and lost his position. He was enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> of King Otto and supported the work of the regency in his newspaper Helios (Ἥλιος; Greek for Sun) until the enactment of the heterogeneous law in 1843, under which citizens born in occupied territories no longer had the right of employment in the public sector. His political ideas turned into staunch conservatism ever since, something that also became evident through his use of an at times even atticizing language.|$|E
25|$|Oliver Cromwell was {{sympathetic}} to the Jewish cause, partly because of his tolerant leanings but chiefly because he foresaw the importance for English commerce of {{the participation of the}} Jewish merchant princes, some of whom had already made their way to London. At this juncture, the English gave Jews full rights in the colony of Surinam, which they had controlled since 1650. There is some debate among historians, particularly Jewish historian Ismar Schorsch, concerning whether or not Menasseh’s personal motives for pursuing the readmission of the Jews by England were primarily political or religious. Schorsch argues that the idea of England being a final place for Jews to inhabit in order to bring <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> of the Messiah was hardly present in Hope of Israel, but rather was developed by Menasseh later in order to appeal to English Christians with Millenarian beliefs.|$|E
25|$|In February–March 1994, {{detailed}} {{reports from}} the Canadian embassy in Kigali meant that the Canadian government {{was one of the}} best informed nations in the world <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> Rwandan genocide. The foreign minister André Ouellet claimed that he nor anyone else in the Cabinet ever saw the reports from Rwanda. On April 6, 1994, the Rwandan genocide began. The government in Ottawa was apparently kept well-informed about what was happening by diplomats and Canadian Forces serving as UN peacekeepers, but the genocide was not considered to be a major problem for Canada, with the Chrétien government taking the view that other powers would stop the genocide. The government first insisted in April 1994 that there was only a civil war in Rwanda, and once it become clear that genocide had begun, on May 2, 1994, Ouellet, speaking for the government in the House of Commons promised humanitarian aid and expressed the hope that the Organization for African Unity would do something to stop the genocide. In 2010, the Canadian government apologized to the people of Rwanda for indifference to the genocide of 1994.|$|E

500|$|Though General Halder did not record {{any mention}} of Jews, German {{historian}} Andreas Hillgruber argued that because of Hitler's frequent contemporary statements <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> war of annihilation against [...] "Judeo-Bolshevism", his generals would have understood Hitler's call {{for the destruction of}} the Soviet Union as also comprising a call for the destruction of its Jewish population. The genocide was often described using euphemisms such as [...] "special tasks" [...] and [...] "executive measures"; Einsatzgruppe victims were often described as having been shot while trying to escape. In May 1941, Heydrich verbally passed on the order to kill the Soviet Jews to the SiPo NCO School in Pretzsch, where the commanders of the reorganised Einsatzgruppen were being trained for Operation Barbarossa. In spring 1941, Heydrich and the First Quartermaster of the Wehrmacht Heer, General Eduard Wagner, successfully completed negotiations for co-operation between the Einsatzgruppen and the German Army to allow the implementation of the [...] "special tasks". Following the Heydrich-Wagner agreement on 28 April 1941, Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch ordered that when Operation Barbarossa began, all German Army commanders were to immediately identify and register all Jews in occupied areas in the Soviet Union, and fully co-operate with the Einsatzgruppen.|$|E
500|$|In November 2011, Marvel {{announced}} that Alan Silvestri, who scored Captain America: The First Avenger, would write and compose the score for The Avengers. Silvestri said, [...] "I've worked on films where {{there have been}} a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together." [...] Silvestri developed the score with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. Whedon said, [...] "The score is very old-fashioned, which is why [...] was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the [...] school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love." ...|$|E

With the {{exception}} of [...] "You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home", which speaks about staying grounded and relying on family, Montana's songs describe the [...] "glitzy-world" [...] and privileges of a celebrity. [...] "Let's Get Crazy" [...] centers on having fun at a party. [...] "The Good Life" [...] is a [...] "sugar-coated celebration of Gucci handbags and Prada shoes". [...] "The Best of Both Worlds" [...] explicitly alludes to Cyrus' character's double life as Montana: regular adolescent that moved from Nashville, Tennessee to Malibu, California by day and pop star by night. In the song, Montana talks about the privileges and advantages that are faced in leading in two lives with references to Orlando Bloom, concerts, friendship and film premieres. The songs Cyrus performs as herself are more reflective, personal, and sentimental. [...] "Hoedown Throwdown" [...] {{is a tribute to}} down-home fun. [...] "The Climb" [...] describes life as a difficult but rewarding journey. [...] "Butterfly Fly Away" [...] is a father-daughter duet by Miley and Billy Ray Cyrus <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> of age.

Country group Rascal Flatts provide an acoustic version of [...] "Backwards" [...] and [...] "Bless the Broken Road" [...] with Williamson County Youth Orchestra.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the most}} vocal critics of end-time {{conspiracy}} theories come from within Christianity. In 1993, historian Bruce Barron wrote a stern rebuke of apocalyptic Christian conspiracism in the Christian Research Journal, when reviewing Robertson's 1991 book The New World Order. Another critique {{can be found in}} historian Gregory S. Camp's 1997 book Selling Fear: Conspiracy Theories and End-Times Paranoia. Religious studies scholar Richard T. Hughes argues that [...] "New World Order" [...] rhetoric libels the Christian faith, since the [...] "New World Order" [...] as defined by Christian conspiracy theorists has no basis in the Bible whatsoever. [...] Furthermore, he argues that not only is this idea unbiblical, it is positively anti-biblical and fundamentally anti-Christian, because by misinterpreting key passages in the Book of Revelation, it turns a comforting message <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> kingdom of God into one of fear, panic and despair {{in the face of an}} allegedly approaching one-world government. Progressive Christians, such as preacher-theologian Peter J. Gomes, caution Christian fundamentalists that a [...] "spirit of fear" [...] can distort scripture and history through dangerously combining biblical literalism, apocalyptic timetables, demonization and oppressive prejudices, while Camp warns of the [...] "very real danger that Christians could pick up some extra spiritual baggage" [...] by credulously embracing conspiracy theories. They therefore call on Christians who indulge in conspiracism to repent.|$|E
