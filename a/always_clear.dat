5|$|While a phoneme can be {{represented}} {{by more than one}} grapheme, each grapheme can be pronounced in only one way. This means that the actual pronunciation of a word is <b>always</b> <b>clear</b> from its orthographic form.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is not <b>always</b> <b>clear.</b> Authors such as Wickler have emphasized {{the significance of the}} signal to its receiver as delineating mimicry from camouflage. However, {{it is not easy to}} assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the distinction between the two can thus be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E
5|$|The {{legality}} of hare coursing across the different {{states of the}} USA is not <b>always</b> <b>clear.</b> Animal Place, a California-based animal rights group which opposes coursing, claims that the activity is legal in California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming but illegal in Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin. The pro-coursing campaign, Stop2110 says that open field coursing is legal in all US states with a huntable population of jackrabbits. Washington state lists jackrabbits as a protected species, due to an unusually low population for a western state, and bans all forms of hunting them.|$|E

5000|$|... {{they would}} be collected, locked into a briefcase, and turned over to a {{relatively}} junior officer (not <b>always</b> <b>cleared</b> to read the decrypts) who would 'make the rounds' to the appropriate offices.|$|R
30|$|In view of Propositions 1 and 2, {{there is}} a {{clear-cut}} policy implication regardless of the standard considered: when only strategic effects are reckoned, proposed V mergers have to be <b>always</b> <b>cleared</b> while proposed H mergers must be always forbidden by antitrust authorities.|$|R
5|$|Initially, the {{relationship}} between price level and output was explained by the quantity theory of money; David Hume had presented such a theory in his 1752 work Of Money (Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary, Part II, Essay III). Quantity theory viewed the entire economy through Say's law, which stated that whatever is supplied to the market will be sold—in short, that markets <b>always</b> <b>clear.</b> In this view, money is neutral and cannot impact the real factors in an economy like output levels. This {{was consistent with the}} classical dichotomy view that real aspects of the economy and nominal factors, such as price levels and money supply, can be considered independent from one another. For example, adding more money to an economy would be expected only to raise prices, not to create more goods.|$|E
5|$|The apothecaries' system {{often used}} the same ounces as the {{precious}} metals system, although even then the number of ounces in a pound could be different. The apothecaries' pound was divided into its own special units, which were inherited (via influential treatises of Greek physicians such as Dioscorides and Galen, 1st and 2nd century) from the general-purpose weight system of the Romans. Where the apothecaries' weights and the normal commercial weights were different, it was not <b>always</b> <b>clear</b> {{which of the two}} systems was used in trade between merchants and apothecaries, or by which system apothecaries weighed medicine when they actually sold it. In old merchants' handbooks the former system is sometimes referred to as the pharmaceutical system, and distinguished from the apothecaries' system.|$|E
5|$|Ecology and {{evolutionary}} biology are considered sister disciplines {{of the life}} sciences. Natural selection, life history, development, adaptation, populations, and inheritance are examples of concepts that thread equally into ecological {{and evolutionary}} theory. Morphological, behavioural, and genetic traits, for example, can be mapped onto evolutionary trees to study {{the historical development of}} a species in relation to their functions and roles in different ecological circumstances. In this framework, the analytical tools of ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize, classify, and investigate life through common systematic principals, such as phylogenetics or the Linnaean system of taxonomy. The two disciplines often appear together, such as in the title of the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution. There is no sharp boundary separating ecology from evolution, and they differ more in their areas of applied focus. Both disciplines discover and explain emergent and unique properties and processes operating across different spatial or temporal scales of organization. While the boundary between ecology and evolution is not <b>always</b> <b>clear,</b> ecologists study the abiotic and biotic factors that influence evolutionary processes, and evolution can be rapid, occurring on ecological timescales as short as one generation.|$|E
60|$|A less courageous boy than Matt {{would have}} been badly scared. But he knew of these fainting spells, for his father had had them years before and had always come out of them feeling weaker in body, it was true, but <b>always</b> <b>clearer</b> in mind.|$|R
50|$|This {{returns the}} {{processor}}'s serial number. The processor serial number was introduced on Intel Pentium III, {{but due to}} privacy concerns, this feature is no longer implemented on later models (PSN feature bit is <b>always</b> <b>cleared).</b> Transmeta's Efficeon and Crusoe processors also provide this feature. AMD CPUs however, do not implement this feature in any CPU models.|$|R

50|$|In The Closers, Bosch {{was once}} again partnered with Rider, while Edgar {{remained}} in Hollywood homicide. Bosch remained partnered with Rider until her transfer to the Chief's office after being shot during Echo Park. During The Overlook, Bosch partnered with Detective Ignacio 'Iggy' Ferras, a younger detective with whom Bosch had not yet developed a solid rapport. Not a stranger to being second-guessed, Bosch was investigated by the LAPD's IAD multiple times, and was <b>always</b> <b>cleared.</b>|$|R

25|$|Until the Amsterdam Games in 1928, the {{architectural}} competition was not divided into categories. The 1928 games introduced a town planning category. However, the division was not <b>always</b> <b>clear,</b> and some designs were awarded prizes in both categories.|$|E
25|$|Cochin's {{published}} and unpublished texts, including over six hundred surviving letters, and the lectures he gave at {{meetings of the}} Academy, are listed by Michel. If his style sometimes lacks elegance, it is <b>always</b> <b>clear</b> and precise.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between science, engineering, and technology is not <b>always</b> <b>clear.</b> Science is systematic {{knowledge of the}} physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation. Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, {{because they have to}} satisfy requirements such as utility, usability, and safety.|$|E

5000|$|Kei and Yuri are two Trouble Consultants (Criminal Division, Class A) for the World Welfare Work Association (3WA), code-named [...] "Lovely Angels", but known {{throughout}} the United Galactica (UG) as the [...] "Dirty Pair", a nickname {{given to them}} by the press due to their bad luck with their missions, which always seem to end in complete disaster. But they are <b>always</b> <b>cleared</b> of any wrongdoing by the UG's Central Computer because the extreme damage is never actually their fault (though their mere presence has been known to make things worse).|$|R

25|$|While {{it is not}} <b>always</b> <b>clear</b> why an intimal tear may occur, {{quite often}} it {{involves}} degeneration of the collagen and elastin {{that make up the}} media. This is known as cystic medial necrosis and is most commonly associated with Marfan syndrome and is also associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.|$|E
25|$|When {{deciding}} whether to optimize a specific part of the program, Amdahl's Law should always be considered: {{the impact on the}} overall program depends very much on how much time is actually spent in that specific part, which is not <b>always</b> <b>clear</b> from looking at the code without a performance analysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between touring and sport touring is not <b>always</b> <b>clear</b> as some manufacturers will list the same bike in either category in different markets. The Honda ST1300 Pan-European, for example, was listed by Honda as a sport touring motorcycle in the United States and Australia, {{but as a}} touring motorcycle in Europe.|$|E
40|$|The model {{features}} the usual IS and LM curves and a dynamic equation {{for changes in}} the government's budget deficit. The price level is assumed to be prefectly flexible so that the goods market <b>always</b> <b>clears,</b> whereas trade unions {{play an important role in}} wage determination. Two union models are considered, the monopoly union and the efficient bargain model. With such explicit recognition of union behavior, the way conventional policies operate is changed with differing outcome. Since there is full price flexibility and the goverment deficit disappears, the effectiveness of reflationary policies is not subject to the usual criticisms. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{number of}} {{possible}} organic reactions is basically infinite. However, certain general patterns are observed {{that can be used}} to describe many common or useful reactions. Each reaction has a stepwise reaction mechanism that explains how it happens in sequence—although the detailed description of steps is not <b>always</b> <b>clear</b> from a list of reactants alone.|$|E
25|$|Chromatophores {{that contain}} {{large amounts of}} yellow pteridine {{pigments}} are named xanthophores; those with mainly red/orange carotenoids are termed erythrophores. However, vesicles containing pteridine and carotenoids are sometimes found in the same cell, {{in which case the}} overall colour depends on the ratio of red and yellow pigments. Therefore, the distinction between these chromatophore types is not <b>always</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{for dealing with}} heresy developed gradually. Bishops had always the authority to look into alleged heretical activity, but as it wasn't <b>always</b> <b>clear</b> what constituted heresy they conferred with their colleagues and sought advice from Rome. Legates were sent out, at first as advisors, later taking {{a greater role in}} the administration. Procedures began to be formalized by time of Pope Gregory IX.|$|E
