25|$|The LST loaded Australian Army medical cargo and {{vehicles}} {{a week later}} and got underway to Morotai, via Biak, on 30 May. With cargo unloaded on 13 June, LST-911 refueled before embarking Australian infantry, railway construction people, and petroleum experts for the invasion of Balikpapan, Borneo. Departing Morotai on 28 June, the LST disembarked the Australians in Balikpapan Bay on 5 July. Returning to Morotai, LST-911 made another ferry run to Balikpapan between 12 and 17 July. While there, the ship embarked the men of a US Army <b>amphibious</b> <b>tractor</b> unit and transported them to Manila Bay, Luzon, Philippines, between 21–27 July.|$|E
25|$|A {{specialised}} vehicle {{intended for}} Sea Lion was the Landwasserschlepper (LWS), an <b>amphibious</b> <b>tractor</b> under development since 1935. It was originally {{intended for use}} by Army engineers to assist with river crossings. Three of them were assigned to Tank Detachment 100 {{as part of the}} invasion; it was intended to use them for pulling ashore unpowered assault barges and towing vehicles across the beaches. They would also have been used to carry supplies directly ashore during the six hours of falling tide when the barges were grounded. This involved towing a Kässbohrer amphibious trailer capable of transporting 10–20 tons of freight behind the LWS. The LWS was demonstrated to General Halder on 2 August 1940 by the Reinhardt Trials Staff on the island of Sylt and, though he was critical of its high silhouette on land, he recognised the overall usefulness of the design. It was proposed to build enough tractors that one or two could be assigned to each invasion barge, but the late date and difficulties in mass-producing the vehicle prevented this.|$|E

500|$|During {{the last}} days of May the 9th Division {{embarked}} at Morotai onto the ships which would transport it to Brunei Bay, and undertook rehearsals for the landing. Due to a shortage of shipping, the available vessels were heavily loaded and many soldiers were forced to endure cramped and hot conditions during the ten days before the landing. Australian official historian Gavin Long later wrote that for many troops these conditions [...] "were as uncomfortable as any of the experiences that followed" [...] during the campaign. The 24th Brigade Group was carried by a variety of landing ships: the two large Australian LSIs [...] and , as well the attack cargo ship , LSD , ten LSTs, five LCIs and seven LSMs from the United States Navy. A total of 38 small LCVPs and 26 LCMs were also assigned to land the brigade once it arrived off Labuan. Due to the coral reefs surrounding the island, the assault waves landed in LVTs of the US Army's 727th <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Tractor</b> Battalion. The convoy carrying the 9th Division left Morotai on 4 June and arrived in Brunei Bay before dawn on 10 June. The main body of the convoy anchored off Labuan, and the remainder proceeded to the Brunei area. A Japanese aircraft dropped a bomb near two of the transport ships off Labuan at 6:51 am, but caused no damage.|$|E
500|$|Throughout January 1944, AirSols {{aircraft}} {{based in}} the Solomon Islands and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aircraft based on Kiriwina kept up a sustained air offensive against Rabaul. Under steady and relentless pressure, the Japanese air defence began to weaken, allowing a landing {{to be made on}} 15 February by New Zealand troops on the Green Islands, which lie little more than [...] from Rabaul. On 16 and 17 February, the US Pacific Fleet's Task Force 58 attacked the main Japanese base at Truk. Most Japanese aircraft were recalled to defend Truk and 19 February saw the last significant interception of Allied aircraft over Rabaul. Meanwhile, on 13 February, General MacArthur had issued orders for the invasion of the Admiralty Islands, codenamed Operation Brewer, which was now scheduled for 1 April. Forces assigned included the 1st Cavalry Division; No.73 Wing RAAF, providing close air support; the 592nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR); the US Marines' 1st <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Tractor</b> Battalion; and US Naval Construction Battalions ("Seabees") to build the naval base—a total of 45,000personnel. However, on 23 February 1944 three Fifth Air Force B-25 Mitchell bombers flew low over Los Negros. The airmen reported that there were no signs of enemy activity and the islands had been evacuated. Lieutenant General George Kenney, the commander of Allied Air Forces in the South West Pacific Area, went to MacArthur and proposed that the unoccupied islands be quickly taken by a small force. According to Kenney: [...] "The General listened for a while, paced back and forth as I kept talking, nodded occasionally, then suddenly stopped and said: That will put the cork in the bottle." ...|$|E
