There had been no contact {{between him and the}} Reagan administration around the interception and he had learned of it from the news media, he told reporters the incident was [...] "unheard of under any international law or code," [...] and that [...] "I am very wounded. Now there is coolness and strain {{as a result of this}} incident." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{laboratory}} {{has attracted}} negative publicity {{from a number}} of events. [...] In 1999, Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee was accused of 59 counts of mishandling classified information by downloading nuclear secrets—"weapons codes" [...] used for computer simulations of nuclear weapons tests—to data tapes and removing them from the lab. After ten months in jail, Lee pleaded guilty to a single count and the other 58 were dismissed with an <b>apology</b> <b>from</b> <b>U.S.</b> District Judge James Parker for his incarceration. Lee had been suspected for having shared U.S. nuclear secrets with China, but investigators were never able to establish what Lee did with the downloaded data. In 2000, two computer hard drives containing classified data were announced to have gone missing from a secure area within the laboratory, but were later found behind a photocopier; in 2003, the laboratory's director John Browne, and deputy director, resigned following accusations that they had improperly dismissed two whistleblowers who had alleged widespread theft at the lab. The year 2000 brought additional hardship for the laboratory {{in the form of the}} Cerro Grande Fire, a severe forest fire that destroyed several buildings (and employees' homes) and forced the laboratory to close for two weeks.|$|E
50|$|Since 2001, {{several cases}} of {{detention}} and search of Indian VIPs at US airports have been reported, resulting in diplomatic tensions between India and the United States. Protest from Indian authorities often led to <b>apologies</b> <b>from</b> <b>US</b> officials. Unlike the United States, India frequently exempts diplomats and other well-known figures from airport security checks.|$|R

25|$|This American {{violation}} of operating in Italian airspace and landing in a Roman airport without overflight or landing permissions, {{was seen by}} the Italians as an affront to their laws and safety regulations and negatively influenced diplomatic relations between the countries for some time.

On May 2, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanded an <b>apology</b> <b>from</b> the <b>U.S.</b> for {{its role in the}} incident. In an editorial on May 4, Beijing Daily questioned Locke's motives by taking in Chen and described Chen as [...] "a tool and a pawn for American politicians to blacken China".|$|R

500|$|After {{the sinking}} of Ehime Maru, many Japanese, {{including}} government officials, questioned why civilians were allowed in Greeneville control room during maneuvers that could place other, uninvolved, vessels at risk. [...] Also, the Japanese {{expressed concern that the}} United States Navy did not immediately take full responsibility for the accident, appeared at first to try to conceal information about the DVE program, and did not court martial Waddle or have him personally apologize immediately after the accident. [...] The subsequent effort by the U.S. government to retrieve the victims' remains from the sunken wreck, numerous <b>apologies</b> <b>from</b> <b>U.S.</b> government representatives and Waddle, and the compensation paid to the Ehime government and to the victims' families appear to have assuaged much of the anger directed toward the U.S. government and military. [...] Many Japanese, both government and private citizens, however, continue to call for the U.S. government to make more effort to reduce or eliminate serious accidents and crimes involving U.S. military personnel.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, then House of Representatives congresspersons Hilda Solis and Luis Gutierrez {{called for}} an <b>apology</b> <b>from</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Government for the Repatriation.

US textbooks generally gloss over the unpleasant portions of history, resulting in many students being aware of the Japanese internment, yet having {{no knowledge of the}} Chicanos being illegally removed even though the numbers in the 1930s was 1 million and in the 1950s another million from 'Operation Wetback', totalling 20 times the number of Japanese-Americans that were interned.|$|R
5000|$|In 1988, U.S. President Ronald Reagan {{signed the}} Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which {{provided}} {{for a formal}} apology and payments of $20,000 for each survivor.

[...] The Civil Liberties Act Amendments of 1992, appropriating an additional $400 million {{in order to ensure}} that all remaining internees received their $20,000 redress payments, was signed into law by President George H.

5000|$|Some Muslims {{responded by}} {{participating}} in nationwide protests, some of which turned into riots. Protesters expressed anti-American sentiments, and also dissatisfaction with the Afghanistan president, with the media reporting chants such as [...] "Death to America, death to Obama, death to Karzai." [...] Despite <b>apologies</b> <b>from</b> <b>US</b> President Barack Obama and US-ISAF commander John R. Allen, demonstrators attacked French, Norwegian and US bases, including those at Mihtarlam and Kapisa.

Most of the anger against <b>U.S.</b> comes <b>from</b> Tajiks: The second largest ethnic group in Afghanistan, our allies who headed the Northern Alliance. Why are they burning the American flag? Why do they, when their dogs lose in their dog fights, call them Americans? ... The Ministry of the Interior, in Kabul, is controlled by Tajiks of the Northern Alliance.

50|$|Brandon Mayfield (born July 15, 1966) is an American {{citizen in}} Washington County, Oregon. He {{was accused of}} being the bomber in the 2004 Madrid train bombings. On May 6, 2004, the FBI arrested Mayfield as a {{material}} witness {{in connection with the}} Madrid attacks, and held him for over two weeks. Mayfield was charged, and an FBI internal review later acknowledged serious errors in their investigation. Ensuing lawsuits have resulted in a formal <b>apology</b> <b>from</b> the <b>U.S.</b> government and a $2 million settlement. An initial ruling declared some provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act unconstitutional, but the United States government appealed, and the ruling was overturned.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1974, Tule Lake was {{the site}} of several pilgrimages by activists calling for an {{official}} <b>apology</b> <b>from</b> the <b>U.S.</b> government for the injustices to Japanese Americans, both citizens and non-citizens. The pilgrimages (every even year, around the 4th of July), serving educational purposes, continue to this day. This Redress Movement gradually gained widespread support and Congress passed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. It included an official governmental apology for the injustices and payment of compensation to camp survivors. A similar law was passed in 1992 to provide for compensation to additional Japanese Americans.|$|R

No nation can fully understand itself or find its place in the world if it does not look with clear eyes at all the glories and disgraces of its past.

50|$|The {{residents}} of Angoon have long {{held out for}} a formal apology for what they consider was undue terrorizing punishment for a cultural misunderstanding. In 1973 the US government offered a ninety thousand dollar settlement {{to the village of}} Angoon in response to the bombardment, but the government and the US Navy declined to offer a formal apology. In 1982, on the centennial of the bombing, Angoon held a memorial potlatch. Tlingit dignitaries from all across Southeast Alaska and Governor Jay Hammond attended. The people of Angoon formally made public their feelings and opinions on the matter, and demanded an <b>apology</b> <b>from</b> the <b>US</b> Navy. No representatives of the Navy attended, despite a formal invitation, and neither the Government or the Navy made an apology, despite repeated requests from the town government, the Tlingit tribal organizations, and representatives of the State of Alaska.|$|R
25|$|Bissell {{and other}} project {{officials}} believed that surviving a U-2 accident from above 70,000feet was impossible, so {{they used the}} preexisting cover story. On 3 May, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, the successor to NACA) announced {{that one of its}} aircraft, making a high-altitude research flight in Turkey, was missing; the government planned to say, if necessary, that the NASA aircraft had drifted with an incapacitated pilot across the Soviet border. By remaining silent, Khrushchev lured the Americans into reinforcing the cover story until he revealed on 7 May that Powers was alive and had confessed to spying on the Soviet Union. Eisenhower turned down Dulles' offer to resign and publicly took full responsibility for the incident on 11 May; by then all overflights were canceled. The Paris Summit collapsed after Khrushchev, as the first speaker, demanded an <b>apology</b> <b>from</b> the <b>U.S.,</b> which Eisenhower refused.|$|R
5000|$|The Egyptian {{airliner}} {{carrying the}} hijackers was intercepted by F-14 Tomcats from the VF-74 [...] "BeDevilers" [...] and the VF-103 [...] "Sluggers" [...] of Carrier Air Wing 17, {{based on the}} aircraft carrier USS Saratoga, and directed to land at Naval Air Station Sigonella (a NATO air base in Sicily) under the orders of U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger; there, the hijackers were arrested by the Italian Carabinieri after a disagreement between American and Italian authorities. In fact, the Prime Minister Bettino Craxi claimed Italian territorial rights over the NATO base. Italian Air Force personnel and Carabinieri lined up facing the United States Navy SEALs which had arrived with two C-141s. Other Carabinieri were sent from Catania to reinforce the Italians. The US eventually allowed the hijackers {{to be taken into}} Italian custody, after receiving assurances that the hijackers would be tried for murder. The other passengers on the plane (including Zaidan) were allowed to continue on to their destination, despite protests by the United States. Egypt demanded an <b>apology</b> <b>from</b> the <b>U.S.</b> for forcing the airplane off course.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2007 ElBaradei {{circulated}} {{a report}} to the upcoming meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors. Its findings conclude that Iran has made important strides towards clarifying its past activities, including provided access to documentation and officials involved in centrifuge design in the 1980s and 1990s. Answers provided by Iran regarding the past P-1 and P-2 centrifuge programs were found to be consistent with the IAEA's own findings. However, Iran has ignored the demands of the UN Security council, and has continued to enrich uranium in the past year. The IAEA is not able to conclusively confirm that Iran isn't currently enriching uranium for military purposes, as its inspections have been restricted to workshops previously declared as part of the civilian uranium enrichment program, and requests for access to certain military workshops have been denied; the report noted that [...] "As a result, the agency's knowledge about Iran's current nuclear program is diminishing". The report also confirmed that Iran now possesses 3000 centrifuges, a 10-fold increase over the past year, though the feed rate is below the maximum for a facility of this design. Data regarding the P-2 centrifuge, which Ahmadinejad has claimed will quadruple production of enriched uranium, was provided only several days before the report was published; the IAEA plan to discuss this issue further in December. In response to the report the US has vowed to push for more sanctions, whilst Iran has called for an <b>apology</b> <b>from</b> the <b>US.</b>|$|R
