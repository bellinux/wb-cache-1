500|$|Shiamak Davar choreographed {{the dance}} {{sequence}} of [...] "Bum Bum Bole," [...] {{and was given}} free rein over its design. He had intended to use 40students from his dance school, but Khan did not want trained dancers. Davar gave the children certain cues and a general idea of what to do, but left the style and final product {{up to them to}} avoid a choreographed appearance. Time constraints meant that while Khan was busy filming [...] "Bum Bum Bole," [...] Ram Madhvani took over as director for [...] "Bheja Kum". The latter sequence, containing a [...] "fun-filled" [...] song of rhythmic dialogue, allowed the audience to perceive how Ishaan sees the world and written languages. It was intended to represent [...] "a young boy's worst nightmare, in terms of... the worst thing that he can think of"; Madhvani based the visual concept on his son's fear of [...] "creepy-crawlies" [...] such as cockroaches, dragonflies, and lizards. Tata Elxsi's Visual Computing Labs made the creatures out of the English alphabet and numbers, although Khan insisted they include the Hindi alphabet as not <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> would be familiar with English. The chalkboard writing's transformation into a snake was included to surprise the audience and [...] "end the song on a high note." ...|$|E
2500|$|The hasty move {{resulted}} in numerous logistical problems, including {{a lack of}} facilities such as portable toilets and medical tents. The move also created {{a problem for the}} stage design; instead of being on top of a rise, which suited the geography at Sears Point, at Altamont the stage would now be {{at the bottom of a}} slope. The Rolling Stones' stage manager on the 1969 tour, Chip Monck, explained that [...] "the stage was one metre high – 39 inches for us – and [...] it was on the top of a hill, so <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> pressure was back upon them". Because of the short notice for the change of location, the stage couldn't be changed. [...] "We weren’t working with scaffolding, we were working in an older fashion with parallels. You could probably have put another stage below it … but nobody had one," [...] Monck said.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, Jack Warner {{spoke of}} the [...] "magic quality that {{transformed}} this sometimes bland and not beautiful little girl into a great artist," [...] and in a 1988 interview, Davis remarked that, unlike many of her contemporaries, she had forged a career {{without the benefit of}} beauty. She admitted she was terrified during the making of her earliest films and that she became tough by necessity. [...] "Until you're known in my profession as a monster, you are not a star," [...] she said, [...] " [...] I've never fought for anything in a treacherous way. I've never fought for anything but the good of the film." [...] During the making of All About Eve, (1950) Joseph L. Mankiewicz told her of the perception in Hollywood that she was difficult, and she explained that when the audience saw her on screen, they did not consider that her appearance was the result of numerous people working behind the scenes. If she was presented as [...] "a horse's ass ... forty feet wide, and thirty feet high," [...] that is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> [...] "would see or care about." ...|$|E

50|$|It {{turns out}} what Oswald and his buddy are {{experiencing}} {{is merely a}} bad dream as they are actually dozing at the cinema. The cinema's janitor comes in, waking and telling them the film is over, and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>audiences</b> had left. Oswald and the big beagle quickly get up and start to leave hysterically.|$|R

6000|$|... "That they do, my hearty," [...] interjected Larkins, {{pointing}} to an inflamed eye {{that had not}} returned to its right dimensions. However, Anderson went on unmoved by the under titter, and demonstrated, to the full satisfaction of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> that {{nothing could be more}} illegal and unfounded than the brewer's claims.|$|E
6000|$|... "Little Bonsa {{has come}} back again, {{bringing}} with her the white man whom she led away," [...] and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> answered, [...] "Little Bonsa {{has come back}} again. Once more we see her {{on the head of}} the Asika as our fathers did. Give her a sacrifice. Give her the white man." ...|$|E
60|$|Rivera was disregarded. For <b>all</b> that <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> noticed, {{he did not}} exist. Spider Lagerty's bloated face {{bent down}} close to his.|$|R
50|$|This type {{of stage}} {{is located in}} the centre of <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> with <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> facing it from <b>all</b> sides. <b>The</b> <b>audience</b> is placed close to the action, which {{provides}} a feeling of intimacy and involvement.|$|R
50|$|The judging {{panel is}} split and vote {{at the end}} of each performance, {{awarding}} either a bronze, silver or gold.

60|$|Before I {{could ask}} her meaning the lords entered, three of them, and glancing at us curiously, {{said that all}} were gathered. Then they turned and went before us to the great hall where every place was filled. Hand in hand we mounted the dais, and as we came <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> rose and greeted us with a roar of welcome.|$|E
6000|$|... "MY DARLING," [...] she says. Just like that. In capital letters. You {{can feel}} the thrill of it run through the {{orchestra}} chairs. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> look at Mr. Harding, some with opera glasses, others with eyeglasses on sticks. They can see that he is {{just the sort of}} ineffectual young man that a starved woman in a problem play goes mad over.|$|E
60|$|A pause followed, {{that was}} succeeded {{by a sudden}} {{outburst}} of song wherein <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> took part. It was a very sonorous and beautiful song or hymn in some language which I did not understand, divided into four verses, {{the end of each}} verse being marked by the bowing of every one of those many singers towards the east, towards the west, and finally towards the altar.|$|E
2500|$|B [...] This song is {{performed}} by a different actor each night, depending upon audience vote, or alternately, not performed at <b>all</b> if <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> has voted for Jasper.|$|R

50|$|Throughout <b>all</b> this, <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> {{began to}} have more choices and control over {{entertainment}} options, and networks were pressured to offer fewer reruns to keep viewers' attention, leading networks to create programming.|$|R
60|$|<b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> {{and with}} them the priests and priestesses bowed before her. She lifted {{the symbol of the}} Child, holding it high above her head, whereon once more they bowed with the deepest veneration. Then still holding the effigy aloft, she turned and with her two attendants passed into the {{sanctuary}} and doubtless thence by a covered way into the house beyond. At any rate we saw her no more.|$|E
6000|$|Entering a large hut, I {{found the}} lady so impolitely named [...] "the Old Cow" [...] in a parlous state. There she lay upon the floor, an {{unpleasant}} object {{because of the}} blood that had escaped from her wound, surrounded by a crowd of other women and of children. At regular intervals she announced that she was dying, and emitted a fearful yell, whereupon <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> yelled also; in short, the place was a perfect pandemonium.|$|E
60|$|I {{never had}} the courage to talk across a long, narrow room I should be {{at the end of the}} room facing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> If I attempt to talk across a room I find myself turning this way and that, and thus at {{alternate}} periods I have part of the audience behind me. You ought never to have any part of the audience behind you; you never can tell what they are going to do.|$|E

50|$|Even {{though the}} movie opened to packed houses, it later on {{turned out to}} be only an above-average grosser. The movie did not go down well with <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>audiences,</b> and <b>the</b> word of mouth was {{hampered}} by the mixed reviews.|$|R
60|$|The goddess Isis, or the English lady--in that {{excitement}} I did not reck which--stood still {{while the}} priests and priestesses and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> who, {{gathered on the}} upper benches of the amphitheatre, could see her above {{the wall of the}} inner court, raised a thrice-repeated and triumphant cry of welcome. Then Harût and the first priestess lifted respectively an ear of corn and a flower from the two topmost platters and held these first to the lips of the child in her arms and secondly to her lips.|$|E
60|$|Executioners {{who were}} waiting for the victim to be chosen in this ordeal by cat, rushed forward and seizing the girl began to drag her towards the fire. The {{prisoner}} who was standing by her and whom we rightly guessed to be her husband, tried to protect her, but his arms being bound, poor fellow, he could do nothing. One of the executioners knocked him down with a stick. For a moment his wife escaped and threw herself upon him, but the brutes lifted her up again, haling her towards the fire, whilst <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> shouted wildly.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, for all this, {{they came}} {{resolved}} to hiss it, right or wrong, [...] and had gotten mercenary fellows, who were such fools {{they did not}} [...] know when to hiss; and this was evident to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> It was [...] wonderful to see men of great quality, and gentlemen, in so mean a [...] combination; but, to my great satisfaction, they came off as meanly [...] as I could wish. I had so numerous an assembly of the best sort of [...] men, who stood so generously in my defence for the three first [...] days, that they quashed all the vain attempts of my enemies; the [...] inconsiderable party of hissers yielded, and the play lived in [...] spite of them.|$|E
50|$|In Offending <b>the</b> <b>Audience</b> {{there is}} no plot. No story is being told at <b>all.</b> Instead, <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> is made aware that what they see is not a {{representation}} of anything else, but is in fact quite literal. The actors continuously repeat the point {{that this is not}} a play, and that nothing theatrical will happen.|$|R
6000|$|By {{this time}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> blackguard <b>audience</b> were sharing, unchecked, the {{amusement}} of the bar. The judge put {{up his hand}} to hide a laugh. Then he said to Lemuel, [...] "Do you wish to question the plaintiff?" ...|$|R
50|$|Later on, {{the rules}} were changed so that the players now knew who had which scores for the first 50 {{questions}}. In <b>all</b> cases, <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> could see who had what score and during the last ten questions the scores were displayed on screen after each answer.|$|R
6000|$|Holding out the tray, he {{presented}} {{it at the}} face of the prisoner on the left, whereon the cat rose, arched its back and began to lift its paws up and down. Presently he moved to the next prisoner and held it before him awhile, and so on till he came to the fifth, that young woman of whom I have spoken. Now the cat grew very angry, for in the death-like stillness we could hear it spitting and growling. At length it seemed to lift its paws and strike the girl upon the face, whereon she screamed aloud, a terrible scream. Then <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> broke out into a shout, a single word, which we understood, for we had heard one very like it used by the people of the Plain. It was [...] "Witch! Witch! Witch!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{next day}} was Wednesday, and in the {{afternoon}} Miss Celia went to hear the children [...] "speak pieces," [...] though it was very seldom {{that any of the}} busy matrons and elder sisters found time or inclination for these displays of youthful oratory. Miss Celia and Mrs. Moss were <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> on this occasion, but Teacher was both pleased and proud to see them, and a general rustle went through the school as they came in, all the girls turning from the visitors to nod at Bab and Betty, who smiled all over their round faces to see [...] "Ma" [...] sitting up [...] "'side of Teacher," [...] and the boys grinned at Ben, whose heart began to beat fast at the thought of his dear mistress coming so far to hear him say his piece.|$|E
60|$|A groan went up as Spider Hagerty peeled Rivera's sweater {{over his}} head. His body seemed leaner, {{because of the}} swarthiness of the skin. He had muscles, but they made no display like his opponent's. What the {{audience}} neglected to see was the deep chest. Nor could it guess the toughness of the fiber of the flesh, the instantaneousness of the cell explosions of the muscles, the fineness of the nerves that wired every part of him into a splendid fighting mechanism. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> saw was a brown-skinned boy of eighteen with what seemed {{the body of a}} boy. With Danny it was different. Danny was a man of twenty-four, and his body was a man's body. The contrast was still more striking as they stood together {{in the center of the}} ring receiving the referee's last instructions.|$|E

She announced to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>audiences</b> that she would marry Alex Lau in her last concert on 18 June. Chen has turned down <b>all</b> <b>the</b> shows of the [...] "Kelly Chen Love Fighters World Tour" [...] (陳慧琳Love Fighters 世界巡迴演唱會) in China, Taiwan, Korea, USA, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore and Australia {{because she wanted to}} give birth.

5000|$|In 1922, {{after her}} husband's death, Dressler and writers Helena Dayton and Louise Barrett {{tried to sell}} a script to the Hollywood studios, but were turned down.

[...] The proposed co-star of Lionel Barrymore or George Arliss were rejected as [...] "old fossils". In 1925, Dressler filmed a pair of two-reel short movies in Europe for producer Harry Reichenbach. The movies, titled the Travelaffs were not released, considered a failure by both Dressler and Reichenbach. Dressler announced her retirement from show business.|$|R
