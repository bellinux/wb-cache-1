5|$|Despite these atrocities, {{the main}} cause of the {{population}} decline was disease. A number of pandemics, notably African sleeping sickness, smallpox, swine influenza and <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery,</b> ravaged indigenous populations. In 1901 alone it was estimated that half-a-million Congolese had died from sleeping sickness. Disease, famine and violence combined to reduce the birth-rate while excess deaths rose.|$|E
5|$|During {{her time}} in the Middle East, Manning had picked up <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery,</b> which led to several admissions to {{hospitals}} in Cairo and Palestine.

5|$|She {{left that}} {{position}} in 1926, {{to work for}} Clifford Dobell at the National Institute for Medical Research where she stayed there for three years. Under Dobell, Bishop studied parasitic amoebae found in the human gastrointestinal tract, focusing on the species responsible for <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery,</b> Entamoeba histolytica. Dobell, Bishop, and Patrick Laidlaw studied the effects of amoebicides like emetine {{for the purpose of}} treating amoebal diseases. Later in her career, she named the amoeba genus Dobellina after her mentor.|$|E
50|$|With correct treatment, {{most cases}} of <b>amoebic</b> and {{bacterial}} <b>dysentery</b> subside within 10 days, and most individuals achieve {{a full recovery}} within two to four weeks after beginning proper treatment. If the disease is left untreated, the prognosis varies with the immune status of the individual patient and the severity of disease. Extreme dehydration can delay recovery and significantly raises the risk for serious complications.|$|R

The pathogenesis {{of many of the}} inflammatory diseases of the large intestine is imperfectly under-stood and the literature contains many conflicting views, and so no classification has been generally accepted. Apart from specific diseases such as diverticulitis, bacillary <b>dysentery,</b> <b>amoebic</b> dysen-tery, and lymphogranuloma venereum, there re-mains to be considered a group of conditions which have been given an abundant and confusing nomenclature.

40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirement for the degree of Masters of Science in Biotechnology, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 58 - 61). Marbelus is an Unani Medicine of unique combination of Bael (Aegle marmelos) fruit and Connessi (Holarrhena antidysenterica) bark, which is highly effective in diarrhoea, <b>dysentery</b> (<b>Amoebic</b> & Bacillary <b>dysentery),</b> giardiasis and helminthiasis. However, toxicity study of the Marbelus syrup is still lacking. The present study is to investigate the acute toxicity of Marbelus Syrup extract on Sprague Dawley rats at a dose of 2000 mg/kg body weight (BW). Sighting {{study was conducted in}} a stepwise procedure using the fixed doses of 5, 50, 300 and 2000 mg/kg BW. No signs of toxicity and no deaths were observed. Based on the sighting study, we selected a dose of 2000 mg/kg BW and observed for 14 days. The study includes control and treatment group, each consisting of 5 female rats. The single oral dose of the Marbelus syrup did not produce mortality or significant changes in the body weight, food and water consumption. In the female rats there was significant (p= 0. 045) increase (16. 40 %) in total protein where albumin content was increased (1. 56 %) but not significantly (p= 0. 458) different from their corresponding control values. The decrease in urea content (0. 80 % decrease; p= 0. 691) & uric acid content was decreased by (12. 54 %; p= 0. 203) which was not statistically significant. The increase in both HDL cholesterol content (10. 13 % increase; p= 0. 46) & total cholesterol content (14. 89 % increase; p= 0. 23) was not statistically significant. It was observed that about 13. 44 % increase in triglyceride content of treated female rats in comparison to their control female rats which was statistically significant(p= 0. 030). However, total proteins were significantly increased indicating dehydration. Apart from triglyceride, other biochemistry parameters demonstrated no significant changes as compared to the control. M.

5|$|Ann Bishop (19 December 1899– 7 May 1990) was a British {{biologist}} from Girton College at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of the Royal Society, {{one of the}} few female Fellows of the Royal Society. She {{was born}} in Manchester but stayed at Cambridge {{for the vast majority of}} her professional life. Her specialties were protozoology and parasitology; early work with ciliate parasites, including the one responsible for blackhead disease in the domesticated turkey, lay the groundwork for her later research. While working towards her doctorate, Bishop studied parasitic amoebae and examined potential chemotherapies for the treatment of amoebic diseases including <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery.</b>|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Mackinnon {{worked in}} {{military}} hospitals in Britain, researching {{and helping to}} diagnose <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery.</b> Her work in the military hospitals fuelled her interest in the topic, which she focussed on during the following years. In 1919, Mackinnon joined King's College, London as a lecturer and became Chair of Zoology in 1927, the first female Chair at the college. She remained in the role as Chair and professor for 22 years. Her research work focussed on parasitic protozoa, and she gave many lectures on the subject over the period of 30 years. She also gave broadcast lectures for schools.|$|E
50|$|The {{housefly}} is a {{very common}} and cosmopolitan species which transmits diseases to man. The organisms of both <b>amoebic</b> and bacillary <b>dysenteries</b> are picked up by flies from the faeces of infected people and transferred to clean food either on the fly's hairs or by the fly vomiting during feeding. Typhoid germs may be deposited on food with the fly's faeces. The house fly cause the spread of yaws germs by carrying them from a yaws ulcer to an ordinary sore. Houseflies also transmit poliomyelitis by carrying the virus from infected faeces to food or drink. Cholera and hepatitis are sometimes fly-borne. Other diseases carried by houseflies are Salmonella, tuberculosis, anthrax, and some forms of ophthalmia. They carry over 100 pathogens and transmit some parasitic worms. The flies in poorer and lower-hygiene areas usually carry more pathogens. Some strains have become immune to most common insecticides.|$|R
40|$|Amoebae may be {{free-living}} or parasitic. Parasitic amoebae {{belong to}} many genera. Entamoeba histolytica {{belongs to the}} genus Entamoeba, {{and it is an}} important human pathogen. E. histolytica is prevalent worldwide. It causes intestinal and extraintestinal amoebiasis. It is much more common in the tropics including Southeast Asia wherever sanitation is poor. Amoebiasis is a major health problem in Southeast Asia. It is the third leading parasitic cause of mortality after malaria and schistosomiasis in the developing countries. Food and water contaminated by human faeces containing E. histolytica cysts are the main sources of infection. The main reservoir of the infection is the human cyst carriers. Transmission is via faecal–oral, mechanical vectors and sexual contact. The life cycle of E. histolytica is completed in a single host, human. Trophozoites can invade all tissues of human including the intestinal mucosa and liver, which is most commonly affected, followed by the lung, skin and brain. The parasite produces virulent factors which are responsible for invasion and destruction of the human tissue. The typical manifestation of intestinal amoebiasis is <b>dysentery.</b> <b>Amoebic</b> liver abscess is the most common extraintestinal complication of amoebiasis. Diagnosis consists of stool examination, serodiagnosis, molecular diagnosis and imaging methods. Treatment consists of the use of amoebicides, and no vaccine is yet available against amoebiasis in humans. Control and prevention include personal hygiene, proper sanitation, drinking safe water and treatment of cases...|$|R
5|$|Manning {{was deeply}} {{affected}} by the sudden death in 1977 of Jerry Slattery, her lover and confidant {{for more than a}} quarter of a century. Manning's last years were also made difficult by physical deterioration; arthritis increasingly affected her, leading to hip replacements in 1976 and in 1979 and she suffered poor health related to <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery</b> caught in the Middle East. Manning began work on the final novel in The Levant Trilogy, The Sum of Things, in which Harriet agrees to sail home to the UK, but having said goodbye to Guy, changes her mind. The novel describes Harriet's travels in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, observes Guy's supposed widowerhood in Cairo after he hears of the sinking of Harriet's ship, and follows Simon Boulderstone's injury during the battle of El Alamein and recovery.|$|E
5|$|During one of {{the work}} parties, Stanley was sent to build a road and stairs leading to a {{memorial}} to the Japanese dead on Bukit Batok Hill (Marked with a Bukit Batok Memorial plaque today, only the stairs and road called Lorong Sesuai are still there to be seen). The chaplain of the regiment, well aware of Stanley's religious conviction and artistic background, requested him to decorate the asbestos walls at the altar area of a small open attap-roofed chapel at Bukit Batok. With charcoal salvaged from around the camp, he drew two murals: Nativity, which featured a Malay Madonna and Descent from the Cross in which he included soldiers in uniforms, using his comrades as models. By then, he was becoming ill and was suffering from a severe renal disorder complicated by <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery.</b> On 23 May 1942, Stanley was lying comatose and was sent to Roberts Barracks in Changi which was converted {{for use as a}} hospital for POWs to recuperate.|$|E
25|$|Poor {{sanitation}} {{is perhaps}} the South Province's greatest health hazard. Many villages {{have no access to}} running water, and even areas that do have it must contend with outbreaks of <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery,</b> bacterial dysentery, brucellosis, giardia, hepatitis A, and schistosomiasis. In 2004, the relatively developed town of Kribi suffered a major cholera epidemic.|$|E
25|$|Wright had {{contracted}} <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery</b> {{on a visit}} to Africa in 1957. Despite various treatments, his health deteriorated over the next three years.

In 1985, the family moved to the Philippines where they served as Baptist missionaries and built a ministry. Prior to becoming pregnant with Tim, his mother contracted <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery</b> and fell into a coma. She discovered she was pregnant while recovering. Because of the medications used to treat her, the fetus experienced a severe placental abruption. Doctors expected a stillbirth and recommended an abortion. The Tebows decided against it citing their strong faith. (abortion was illegal in the Philippines in any case) On August 14, 1987, she gave birth to Tim in Manila.|$|E
25|$|Edward the Black Prince {{seemed to}} have good health until 1366. It was not until his {{campaign}} in Spain to restore Don Pedro the Cruel to the throne of Castille that he became ill. On this expedition, his army suffered so badly from dysentery that {{it is said that}} one out of every five Englishmen would not return home. Edward the Black Prince contracted an illness on this expedition that would ail him until his death in 1376. It is widely believed that he contracted <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery</b> but some argue against the likelihood that he could sustain life with a ten-year battle with dysentery. Other possible diagnoses include nephritis, cirrhosis or a combination of these. His illness prevented him participating on the battlefield. However, in 1370, the Prince had to leave his sick bed and raise an army to defend Aquitaine against Charles V of France.|$|E
25|$|In April, the Marauders {{were ordered}} by General Stilwell {{to take up}} a {{blocking}} position at Nhpum Ga and hold it against Japanese attacks, a conventional defensive action for which the unit had not been equipped. At times surrounded, the Marauders coordinated their own battalions in mutual support to break the siege after a series of fierce assaults by Japanese forces. At Nhpum Ga, the Marauders killed 400 Japanese soldiers, while suffering 57 killed in action, 302 wounded, and 379 incapacitated due to illness and exhaustion. Of the unit's 200 mules, 75 were killed by artillery and mortar fire. A concurrent outbreak of <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery</b> (contracted after linking up with Chinese forces) further reduced their effective strength. Although the Marauders had previously avoided losses from this deadly disease (in part by use of halazone tablets and strict field sanitation procedures), their encampment with Chinese infantry, who used the rivers as latrines, proved their undoing (the Chinese troops, who always boiled their drinking water, were not seriously affected).|$|E
25|$|In April 1944, Stilwell {{launched}} his final offensive {{to capture the}} Burmese city of Myitkyina. In support of this objective, the Marauders were ordered to undertake a long flanking maneuver towards the town, involving a grueling 65-mile jungle march. Having been deployed since February in combat operations in the jungles of Burma, the Marauders were seriously depleted and suffering from both combat losses and disease, and lost additional men while {{en route to the}} objective. A particularly devastating scourge was a severe outbreak of <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery,</b> which erupted shortly after the Marauders linked up with the Chinese Army in India, called X Force. By this time, the men of the Marauders had openly begun to suspect Stilwell's commitment to their welfare, and no effort to hide their displeasure with their hard-driving commander. Despite their sacrifices, Stilwell appeared unconcerned about their losses, and had rejected repeated requests for medals for individual acts of heroism. Initial promises of a rest and rotation were ignored; the Marauders were not even air-dropped replacement uniforms or mail until late April.|$|E
25|$|He {{served as}} the king's {{representative}} in Aquitaine, where he and Joan kept a court which was considered among the most fashionable of the time. It was the resort of exiled kings such as James IV of Majorca and Peter of Castile. Peter of Castile, thrust from his throne by his illegitimate brother Henry of Trastámara, offered Edward the lordship of Biscay in 1367, {{in return for the}} Black Prince's aid in recovering his throne. Edward was successful in the Battle of Nájera (3 April), in which he soundly defeated the combined French and Castilian forces led by Bertrand du Guesclin. Peter did not pay fully and refused to yield Biscay, alleging lack of consent of its states, the Juntas Generales de Vizcaya and Edward retreated to Guienne by July. The Black Prince returned to England in January 1371 and died on 8 June 1376 (a week before his 46th birthday), after a long-lasting illness that was probably <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery,</b> contracted ten years earlier while campaigning in Spain.|$|E
500|$|Diseases {{imported}} by Arab traders, European colonists and African porters ravaged the Congolese {{population and}} [...] "greatly exceeded" [...] the numbers killed by violence. Smallpox, sleeping sickness, <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery,</b> venereal diseases (especially syphilis and gonorrhea) and swine influenza were particularly severe. Sleeping sickness, in particular, was [...] "epidemic in large areas" [...] of the Congo {{and had a}} high mortality rate. In 1901 alone, {{it is estimated that}} as many as 500,000 Congolese died from sleeping sickness. Vansina estimated that five percent of the Congolese population perished from swine influenza. In areas in which dysentery became endemic, between 30 and 60 percent of the population could die. Vansina also pointed to the effects of malnutrition and food shortages in reducing immunity to the new diseases. The disruption of African rural populations may have helped to spread diseases further.|$|E

The couple visited Mombasa, Nairobi, and Machakos in Kenya; then moved on to Tanganyika Territory, where they hunted in the Serengeti, around Lake Manyara, and west and southeast of present-day Tarangire National Park. Their guide was the noted [...] "white hunter" [...] Philip Percival who had guided Theodore Roosevelt on his 1909 safari. During these travels, Hemingway contracted <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery</b> that caused a prolapsed intestine, and he was evacuated by plane to Nairobi, an experience reflected in [...] "The Snows of Kilimanjaro". On Hemingway's return to Key West in early 1934, he began work on Green Hills of Africa, which he published in 1935 to mixed reviews.|$|E
500|$|When Germany invaded France in 1914, Ravel {{tried to}} join the French Air Force. He {{considered}} his small stature and light weight ideal for an aviator, but was rejected because of his age and a minor heart complaint. After several unsuccessful attempts to enlist, Ravel finally joined the Thirteenth Artillery Regiment as a lorry driver in March 1915, when he was forty. Stravinsky expressed admiration for his friend's courage: [...] "at his age and with his name {{he could have had}} an easier place, or done nothing". Some of Ravel's duties put him in mortal danger, driving munitions at night under heavy German bombardment. At the same time his peace of mind was undermined by his mother's failing health. His own health also deteriorated; he suffered from insomnia and digestive problems, underwent a bowel operation following <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery</b> in September 1916, and had frostbite in his feet the following winter.|$|E
500|$|Among a small {{coterie of}} wartime RAAF commanders {{considered}} suitable for future senior roles, Hancock retained his rank of group captain following {{the end of}} hostilities. As Director of Personnel Services during 1946, he was involved in restructuring the Air Force into a dramatically smaller peacetime service. He recalled this time as a [...] "twilight period" [...] when [...] "no-one wanted to know about us" [...] and many good people were let go due to the government's parsimonious retention policies. In 1947, Hancock was promoted to air commodore and appointed inaugural commandant of the newly formed RAAF College, Point Cook, the Air Force's equivalent of Duntroon and the Royal Australian Naval College. He also drafted the institution's charter. Departing in late 1949, he spent the following year in Britain, where he attended the Imperial Defence College. On his return to Australia in 1951, he was promoted to acting air vice marshal and made Deputy Chief of the Air Staff. He was raised to a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1953 New Years Honours. In October that year, Hancock took over from Air Vice Marshal Frank Bladin as Air Member for Personnel (AMP). As AMP, he occupied a seat on the Air Board, the service's controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers and which was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. Completing his term in January 1955, Hancock was posted to Britain as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in London. He spent much of the latter half of 1955 and early 1956 laid low by a stomach ailment that was initially diagnosed as <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery</b> but was later thought to be Malta fever or malaria.|$|E

Their rate of advance compared to the Australian soldiers was considerably slower. It rained hard every afternoon at about three o'clock, and beginning on 15 October they were drenched by five days of steady rain. [...] Constant tropical downpours, searing heat, and dripping humidity left the soldiers constantly wet. At night in the higher altitudes, temperatures dropped rapidly, leaving the men chilled.|$|E
2500|$|Slightly {{built and}} not noted for {{possessing}} a strong constitution, Morley saw his health deteriorate {{over the years}} spent laboring in the Central American jungles under often adverse conditions.

During the 1930s, it also became evident that he had developed cardiac difficulties, which would plague him for the remainder of his life. Nevertheless, although he [...] "detested" [...] the jungle conditions, he persevered in his work with evident enthusiasm.|$|E

2500|$|The Stanley has {{influenced}} several authors. Ernest Hemingway {{stayed at the}} hotel on several occasions. In 1934, Hemingway stayed for several weeks while recovering from <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery.</b> During this time, he made notes for his novels The Green Hills of Africa and The Snows of Kilimanjaro. Hemingway mentions the Stanley in these works, and is also credited with introducing the word [...] "safari" [...] to the English language. Hemingway returned to the hotel in 1954. Colonel John Henry Patterson, who wrote the true story The Man-eaters of Tsavo that inspired the film The Ghost and the Darkness, also found his inspiration while staying at the Stanley.|$|E
2500|$|Some countries, such as South Africa, or Thailand {{have very}} {{different}} infectious disease-related epidemiology to Europe and North America. Exposure to diseases without having built up natural immunity can be a hazard for weakened individuals, specifically with respect to gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. Hepatitis A, <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery,</b> paratyphoid) which could weaken progress and expose the patient to mosquito-transmitted diseases, influenza, and tuberculosis. However, because in poor tropical nations diseases run the gamut, doctors {{seem to be more}} open to the possibility of considering any infectious disease, including HIV, TB, and typhoid, while there are cases in the West where patients were consistently misdiagnosed for years because such diseases are perceived to be [...] "rare" [...] in the West.|$|E
2500|$|Futabayama is {{particularly}} remembered for achieving the longest run of consecutive victories in sumo bouts, with 69, {{a record that}} still stands today.

During this run he was promoted to ōzeki and then yokozuna. It generated such excitement among the public that the Sumo Association extended the number of days per tournament from 11 to 13, and then to 15. He was finally defeated on January 3, 1939 by maegashira Akinoumi (later a yokozuna himself).

2500|$|In {{their final}} mission, the Marauders {{suffered}} 272 killed, 955 wounded, and 980 evacuated for illness and disease; some men later died from cerebral malaria, <b>amoebic</b> <b>dysentery,</b> and/or scrub typhus. [...] Somewhat ironically, Marauders evacuated {{from the front}} lines were given jungle hammocks with protective sandfly netting and rain covers in which to sleep, equipment which might have prevented various diseases and illnesses had they been issued earlier in the campaign. [...] The casualties included General Merrill himself, who had suffered a second heart attack before going down with malaria. He was replaced by his second-in-command, Colonel Charles N. Hunter, who later prepared a scathing report on General Stilwell's medical evacuation policies (eventually prompting an Army Inspector General investigation and congressional hearings). [...] By the time the town of Myitkyina was taken, only about 200 surviving members of the original Marauders were present. A week after Myitkyina fell, on 10 August 1944, the 5307th was disbanded with a final total of 130 combat-effective officers and men (out of the original 2,997).
