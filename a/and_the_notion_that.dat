Whether Madison's theory of Republicanism really supported the nullification movement, and more broadly whether the ideas he expressed between 1798 and 1800 are consistent with his work before and after this period, are the main questions surrounding the Report in the modern literature.|$|E

25|$|CTR as {{pedagogy}} {{has been}} almost universally employed by schools {{since its inception in}} the late nineteenth century, and until the 1960s, its limitations and ineffectiveness received little criticism. However, the 1966 Dartmouth Conference reflected an influx of new scholarly ideas about composition studies that introduced the ideas of process over product <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> teachers should serve as guides in the composition process rather than dictatorial authority figures. Since then, the main elements of composition pedagogy have been defined and explored by countless scholars, and the concepts associated with CTR have been replaced by a wealth of pedagogical approaches to the field of rhetoric and composition. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the field of rhetoric and composition saw a process revolution, fueled by two distinct pedagogies: expressivism, both moderate and radical, and cognitivism.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophy}} of anarchism {{was also a}} point of contention during the trial. Gordon Simmons, an adjunct professor of philosophy at West Virginia State University and Marshall University, testified as Sierra's final witness. His testimony included explanations of the philosophy espoused by Sierra's proposed club, its impact on American social and political movements, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> anarchists had historically been unjustly persecuted in American courts, citing such examples as the trials of the Haymarket affair and Sacco and Vanzetti. The lawyer for the school officials countered that anarchism had prominent ties to terrorism and assassination, and referred to Timothy McVeigh and Theodore Kaczynski as anarchists. On July 12, {{the court ruled that}} Sierra had been justly suspended and forbidden to wear the T-shirts, but had been improperly denied the right to start a club, and awarded her the $1 in damages she sought. Attorneys for both Kanawha County and Sierra asked that those parts of the verdict that went against their client, requesting that Kanawha Chief Circuit Judge James C. Stucky throw out the jury's verdict, finding it to be inconsistent, and that he rule himself instead.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{assuming}} the external form of traditional literature, Ion Creangă's interests and creative interventions, Călinescu noted, separated {{him from his}} roots: [...] "peasants do not have [...] entirely cultured gifts.... Too much 'atmosphere', too much dialogic 'humor', too much polychromy {{at the expense of}} linear epic movements. The peasant wants the bare epic and desires the unreal." [...] The commentator passed a similar judgment on the author's use of ancient sayings, concluding that, instead of crystallizing and validating local folklore, the accounts appeal to cultured tastes, having as the generation of comedy and volubility as their main purpose. According to Vianu's assessment Creangă was [...] "a supreme artist" [...] whose use of [...] "typical sayings" [...] attests [...] "a man of the people, but not an anonymous and impersonal sample." [...] These verdicts, directly contradicting Junimist theories, were mirrored by several other 20th century exegetes belonging to distinct schools of thought: Pompiliu Constantinescu, Benjamin Fondane and Ion Negoițescu. Writing {{during the second half of}} the century, critic Nicolae Manolescu passed a similar judgment, believing that Creangă was motivated by a [...] "strictly intellectual sensuousness" [...] <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> [...] "pleasure arises from gratuitousness", while Manolescu's colleague Mircea Braga referred to [...] "the great secret of the man who has managed to transfer unaltered the code of popular creativity into the immanence of the cultured one." [...] In Braga's assessment, this synthesis managed [...] "the impossible", but the difficulty of repeating it with each story also resulted in mediocre writings: [...] "from among his few texts, even fewer are located on the relatively highest level of the relative aesthetic hierarchy".|$|E
500|$|Kaze of Beneath The Tangles, however, {{disagreed}} with these interpretations of koi <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> {{the story was}} a [...] "bittersweet romance" [...] or [...] "another love story", and instead felt that the theme was unrecognized. Focusing instead on the human need for companionship and understanding, Kaze noted that both Takao and Yukari lacked meaningful connections with their peers and friends, a view shared by reviewer Bradly Storm at Hardcore Gamer. Together through their conversations—in their [...] "garden of words"—they found companionship: Takao finding someone he can share his passion with, and Yukari finding someone who treats her as a person. However, because of the age difference, this discovery varied between the characters. For Yukari, an older and more experienced individual, her hopeless feelings of lonely sadness disappeared when she learned she could connect with Takao, a revelation that she saw as her salvation. For Takao, a boy with an unsupportive family and friends who seemed more like acquaintances, he did not realize his lack of companionship until he discovered it with Yukari, a new feeling he mistook for romantic love but only realized its true nature after she had moved away. According to Kaze, [...] "romantic love could potentially bloom from such feelings, {{but that is not}} what the story is about". Instead, the love they shared was more basic, making the age difference immaterial. At the end of film, both characters maintained their friendship through letters, but otherwise began growing as people by moving on with their lives and presumably finding new relationships with other people. The hope was that one day they could reunite and renew their companionship [...] "without needing to cling to each other". However, neither could [...] "learn to walk again" [...] if they continued to isolate themselves {{from the rest of the}} world and take shelter with each other in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen.|$|E
