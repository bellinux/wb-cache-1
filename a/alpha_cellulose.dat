40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The work in {{this thesis}} {{involves}} the development of specimen preparation techniques for the observation with an electron microscope of alpha particle tracks in cellulose nitrate plastic. Both direct observation using thin films and replica production techniques were investigated. Direct observation of the alpha tracks was accomplished by cutting thin sections of the irradiated plastic with an ultramicrotome. A method for casting very thin films of the <b>cellulose</b> nitrate for <b>alpha</b> track observation was also developed. Replica techniques which were developed include the single stage Formvar, single stage carbon and double stage carbon replicas. Each of these techniques are explained in detail. Although these techniques were developed using alpha particle irradiations of cellulose nitrate, applications involving other charged particle tracks could easily use the same procedures. The casting of thin films of cellulose nitrate for direct observations of the tracks {{and the production of}} a double stage replica of the cellulose nitrate surface have both resulted in excellent electron microscope beam images without destroying the original plastic or particle tracks. With further development effort, it is thought that these two techniques will allow observation of <b>alpha</b> tracks in <b>cellulose</b> nitrate on the order of 100 [superscript o]A in diameter...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn insect, host-finding is {{initiated}} by selectively laying eggs in particular site, {{which is known}} as oviposition. Host preference in lyctines is determined by some features like vessel size, moisture and starch content of the targeted host. Limited information {{is available on the}} significance of diet quality other than starch towards oviposition ability and fecundity of the lyctines. This study discusses the effects of nutritional quality of diets on oviposition of Lyctus africanus after feeding with cellulose-, cellulose powder (CP) and <b>alpha</b> <b>cellulose</b> (AC), and wood-based diets. Oviposition test was conducted on quantitative ashless filter papers which served as oviposition sites. The filter papers had been impregnated with nutritive solution and water to attract females laying their eggs. Those oviposition sites were put separately into a plastic jar with 10 pairs of lyctines adult. Then the eggs number and survived adults after two weeks were observed. The results showed that lyctine adults emerged from the cellulose-based diets ovipositing more eggs significantly on nutritive solution- than water-impregnated filter papers. This result may confirm that starch and sugar are the vital nutrients for L. africanus which could attract adult females to lay their eggs. The cellulose-based diets, both CP- and AC-based diet, are likely to affect adult stage of L. africanus to be more fecund by laying more eggs on filter papers. Also, CP-based diet generated the adults with higher survivals after ovipositing the eggs on both nutritive content and water-impregnated filter paper. The diet composition, in the case of cellulose content, is thus suggested to influence the fecundity of the adult insects of L. africanus...|$|E
40|$|The wood of {{the gender}} Eucalyptus {{occupies}} a prominence place among other cellulose sources due to its chemical composition, its low cost, abundance and availability. Among the chemical pulping processes, kraft process is the most extensively one used {{for the production of}} cellulosic pulps starting from eucalyptus wood. The anthraquinone (AQ) usage in the pulping has as main purposes to increase the delignification rate as well as to protect the pulp from the carbohydrate degradation. The present work has aimed to use the anthraquinone as an addictive in the cooking seeking to reduce the load of applied sulphidity without harming the quality of the pulp. The kraft and kraft/AQ cooking were accomplished in rotative laboratorial digester being varied the active alkali initially (10, 13, 16 and 19 %) and, later, the sulphidity (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 %), maintaining the other conditions constant aiming to obtain pulp with kappa number close to nine. Starting from the variation of the active alkali and of the sulphidity, delignification curves were established between active alkali and kappa number and, sulphidity and kappa number, where it was possible to establish the minimum necessary amounts of alkali, {{as well as of the}} sulphidity. Starting from the cooking, it was possible to establish the active alkali and sulphidity loads of 17, 4 % and 8, 8 %, respectively. The cooking to the certain conditions presented screened yield of 48, 63 %, and the yield based on the initial mass of wood was of 42, 24 %, obtaining a high quality pulp, in other words, with low number kappa and hemicelluloses tenor (0, 41 %) and high tenor of <b>alpha</b> <b>cellulose</b> (98, 49 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Derivatization of <b>alpha</b> <b>cellulose</b> by periodate {{oxidation}} is {{an useful}} method for production of dialdehyde cellulose (DAC). Conversion of the 2, 3 -hydroxyl groups {{to a pair}} of aldehyde groups along with cleavage of the C 2 –C 3 bond of anhydroglucose unit reduces crystallinity of initial material, leaving DAC soluble in water under mild conditions. Solubilization in hot water is necessary to obtain product in solution. The first part of our work confirmed that solubilization causes severe degradation of the molecular weight of the polymer. However, the chemistry and processes within these solutions are currently poorly understood. In {{the main part of the}} study, products of periodate oxidation were identified in acidic DAC solutions by NMR spectroscopy for the first time. Subsequent investigation of the acidic DAC solution's aging demonstrated that the low pH of the DAC solution considerably slows the degradation processes, namely the decrease of reactive aldehyde group content when compared to previous studies. Large increase in the molecular weight, observed after 14  days of aging, was explained by formation of intermolecular hemiacetals. Our results demonstrate that pH-stabilized aqueous DAC solutions remained active (e. g. applicable for cross-linking reactions) even several weeks after preparation, therefore reducing the need to prepare a fresh solution each time. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. 16 - 05961 S, GACR, Grantová Agentura České Republiky; 16 - 05961 S, GAČR, Grantová Agentura České Republiky; IGA/CPS/ 2015 / 005, UTB, Univerzita Tomáše Bati ve Zlíně; LM 2011020, MŠMT, Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy; LO 1504, MŠMT, Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a TělovýchovyMinistry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic-Program NPU I [LO 1504]; Czech Science Foundation [16 - 05961 S]; TBU in Zlin [IGA/CPS/ 2015 / 005]; Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC) -open access project [LM 2011020]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republi...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedA nearly continuous, {{annually}} resolved {{record of}} cellulosic δ¹⁸O and δ¹³C is presented for the East African tree Vitex payos {{for the recent}} through the late 19 th century. The isotope data of individual rings is cross-calibrated against atmospheric variables during the late 20 th century to ascertain how and when during the year cellulose obtains its δ¹⁸O and δ¹³C value in response to environmental conditions at the tree site. During the late 20 th century the δ¹⁸O and δ¹³C obtained from <b>alpha</b> <b>cellulose</b> from annual rings of V. payos correlates strongly with precipitation amount and with relative humidity, with depleted (enriched) δ¹⁸O and depleted (enriched) δ¹³C values associated with increased (reduced) precipitation and relative humidity. The strongest correlations are found between cellulose δ¹⁸O {{and the amount of}} precipitation and the relative humidity during December-February, although temperature contributes to the observed isotopic variance as well. Relative humidity in December-February appears to have the strongest correlation to annual cellulosic δ¹³C values. The results of this cross-correlation study are used to develop a preliminary seasonal growth model for V. payos that reflects variations in precipitation amount and relative humidity during the December-February growing season.; During the late 20 th century the East Africa continent and the western Indian Ocean basin experienced anomalously wet conditions in summer (December-February) when sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were anomalously warm in the western Indian Ocean and zonal winds were anomalously strong in association with positive phases of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and/or El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Using the correlation between cellulosic isotopic values and hydroclimate variability over East Africa and Indian Ocean SSTs during the late 20 th century a preliminary climate reconstruction is proposed for the pre- 20 th century from V. payos δ¹⁸O and δ¹³C. The isotopic record of V. payos indicates the late 19 th century was anomalously wet over East Africa when compared to the late 20 th century, consistent with lake level changes and ice core isotopic data. Climate model simulations indicate the wetter pre- 20 th century climate was a response to enhanced warming in the western Indian Ocean basin, generating a low pressure center and easterly surface winds that brought moisture to East Africa. The annually resolved isotopic data from V. payos suggest much of the observed and modeled hydroclimate variability at multidecadal to century scales is a response to SST anomalies in the western Indian Ocean.; The {{results of the present study}} should help guide future phenological studies of V. payos and other Vitex species in equatorial East Africa. Importantly, stable isotope data obtained from individual growth rings suggests that the annual production of cellulose in V. payos occurs during a short seasonal period from January to February, information that could not be inferred directly from tree ring width data alone. Further improvements in sampling tree rings at intra-annual resolution and in-situ monitoring of weather/climate variables, including isotopic variability of moisture would be necessary in order to fully utilize cellulosic δ¹⁸O as a climate proxy, with the potential for becoming a continent-wide hydrologic monitoring network, the first of its kind from Africa. The isotopic database for V. payos is among the few available terrestrial climate records provides estimates of how hydrologic budgets varied over East Africa during the past several centuries...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{developed during}} my PhD can be inserted within {{the activities of}} the Archaeometry Laboratory of the Physics Department of the University of Ferrara, where works of art are studied using non invasive and non destructive techniques for diagnostic purposes. In particular, in the most recent years the attention has been focused on contemporary artworks. Concerning contemporary art, {{it is well known that}} one of the most important aspects is authentication and, as a consequence, identification of fakes. Sometimes a simple artistic style is not sufficient to solve this issue; therefore the support of scientific analyses is widely requested. In this framework, during my PhD, the capability to solve authentication issues by radiocarbon (14 C) dating in an univocal way has been tested. The possibility to use the radioactive isotope 14 C in contemporary art is given by the so called Bomb Peak, which is the huge increase of the radiocarbon concentration happened in atmosphere after the end of the Second World War. Actually, in the late 1950 s and early 1960 s, as a consequence of hundreds of nuclear weapon tests, large amounts of neutrons were produced in the atmosphere, thus significantly increasing the radiocarbon production rate. This artificial 14 C input caused a global increase of the 14 C/ 12 C ratio in the atmospheric CO 2 and in all the other reservoirs, i. e. in the oceans and in the biosphere. The increase was so large that the atmospheric radiocarbon concentration was almost doubled in less than 10 years. Then, after 1963, when the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treat was signed, the 14 C concentration started to decrease due to the rapid exchanges with the carbon reservoirs. This is just the peculiar trend of the 14 C concentration that is exploited in forensics to date samples with a very high precision. In order to verify the possibility to use radiocarbon dating for contemporary artworks, several measurements were performed on paper and canvas samples collected from artistic objects of the XX century. The radiocarbon measurements were performed by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) at INFN-LABEC (Laboratorio di Tecniche Nucleari per i Beni Culturali) in Florence, where a 3 MV Tandem accelerator and a sample preparation laboratory are installed. In these three years, several hardware developments concerning the experimental set-up were also performed. One of the hardware developments concerned the installation of a new graphitization line; thanks to this upgrade, the radiocarbon concentrations measured in blank samples were satisfactory and of the same order of magnitude of the pMC values measured in the first years of the operation of the AMS facility at LABEC. In addition, thanks to the new silicon photodiode installed as rare isotope detector on the AMS beam line, a remarkable improvement of the energy resolution was achieved, paving the way also to the measurement of rare isotopes other than 14 C. Moreover, two new chemical pre-treatments were tested: these procedures were especially dedicated to deteriorate cellulose-based materials (<b>alpha</b> <b>cellulose</b> extraction protocol) and to restore artworks (chloroform-based procedure). Besides radiocarbon measurements on several test samples, the effectiveness of these new pre-treatments was also confirmed by using other techniques, i. e. Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy, FTIR, and Attenuated Total Reflectance, ATR. Since these techniques are non destructive (ATR) or require just a very small quantity of sample (FTIR), their use during the sample preparation steps to verify the applied protocols can be proposed as a routine practice. The improvements regarding the experimental set up, especially the new chemical pre-treatments, and the radiocarbon measurements performed on paper and canvas samples collected from objects of the XX century were done in order to verify advantages and limits of radiocarbon dating for contemporary artworks. As far as paper is concerned, we analyzed samples collected from Italian newspapers published since 1930 s until present and from fine papers used in limited edition drawing prints realized in the second half of the 20 th century. The canvas samples were collected from contemporary art paintings. The measured 14 C concentrations were compared to the expected concentrations estimated on the basis of the year indicated on each sample (i. e. the year of publishing/printing or the year signed by the painter), allowing us to highlight advantages and limits of the use of this dating method. The experimental data have clearly pointed out that we can easily discriminate between samples of the first half and samples of the second half of the 20 th century, giving us the possibility to use radiocarbon to solve authentication issues. Important differences between materials derived from long-living plants (dailies paper from wood) and from short-living plants (fine paper from cotton and canvas from cotton or flax) have been shown. In particular, as far as newspaper samples are concerned, comparing the experimental results with the reference Bomb 04 NH 1 curve, lower 14 C concentrations than the atmospheric values were generally measured (in fact, in this case, the raw material is wood). Thus, even though we were able to perform radiocarbon measurements with a high precision, we have verified that, due to the characteristic manufacturing processes of paper, it is not possible to match each measured radiocarbon concentration to the corresponding calendar year in which the paper was produced. In the case of fine paper and canvas samples, we have noticed a general agreement between the measured radiocarbon concentrations and the expected values, although an offset of few years with respect to the expected date has been found. This discrepancy can be related to a reasonable time gap between the year when the plant, from which paper or canvas were manufactured, was cut and when these materials were really used. All these radiocarbon measurements have been supported by a characterization of the samples by optical and electron microscopy (SEM), to study the state of preservation and the raw materials. This is very important to choose the better chemical protocol to apply for the sample preparation and to better interpret the radiocarbon results. The results achieved with this work have demonstrated to be very important also for some real cases. The 14 C measurements performed on a canvas sample collected from a restored painting have confirmed the effectiveness of the new chloroform-based sample preparation protocol. The dating of a painting attributed to F. Léger (1881 - 1955), that has been measured to be a fake, has shown how powerful radiocarbon can be for contemporary art authentication issues, i. e. for the identification of forgeries made in the last decades of the 20 th century of artworks that are supposed to be of the first half of the same century. The research developed in these three years has shown advantages and limits of radiocarbon dating in studying of artworks of the 20 th century. In particular, we have proved that it is possible to solve authentication issues especially for samples obtained from annual plants. This important result can be very useful for the art critics, the curators of the museum and the art merchants. It is obvious that the radiocarbon measurements and the other scientific techniques have always to be supported by the knowledge of other independent information concerning for example the story of the sample to be dated...|$|E
