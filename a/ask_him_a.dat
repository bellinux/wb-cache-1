25|$|When police {{knocked on}} Einem's door and enquired {{about whether they}} could <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> few questions, his {{immediate}} reaction was {{to say that he}} wouldn't answer anything without speaking to his lawyer first. This made police suspect that he had something to hide.|$|E
25|$|When Onegin finally arrives, Zaretsky is {{supposed}} to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> final time if {{he would like to}} apologise. Instead, Zaretsky is surprised by the apparent absence of Onegin's second. Onegin, against all rules, appoints his servant Guillot as his second which was the last action to take from a noble man (chapter 6, stanza XXVII), a blatant insult for the nobleman Zaretsky. Zaretsky angrily accepts Guillot as Onegin's second. By his actions, Zaretsky does not act as a nobleman should; in the end Onegin wins the duel.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{really had}} {{no option but to}} agree to do it, despite my {{reservations}} about working in television. Coming so quickly after my decision to stay on the radio, this was quite an irony. I was given one day of training... from one minute to zero, at which point you have to say goodbye. I did not find that easy at all... I made a real hash of it after one of the early games..... very kindly, suggested a plan... as soon as the count started in our earpieces I would <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> question, and he would talk until the count reached eight seconds to go. I would then thank him, turn to the camera and tell the audience briefly about the next game to be televised. Miraculously, {{for the rest of the}} tournament I always heard 'zero' in my ear at the moment I said goodbye... the whole experience served to confirm my belief that my decision to stick with Test Match Special was the right one." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{prospective}} memory; event-based and time based. [...] Event-based prospective memory is when an environmental cue prompts you to carry out a task. [...] An example is when seeing a friend reminds you to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> question. In contrast, time-based prospective memory occurs when you remember to carry out a task at a specific time. [...] An example of this is remembering to phone your sister on her birthday. [...] Time-based prospective memory is more difficult than event-based prospective memory because there is no environmental cue prompting one to remember to carry out the task at that specific time.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few years}} later her friend Mary Hanford Ford related some of what took place meeting `Abdu'l-Bahá as a second hand account. A few facts are {{detailed}} - Farmer had met `Abdu'l-Bahá and accepted the religion on one occasion, and on another wanted to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> series of questions {{in the context of}} a review of her whole life - but when she wrote it all down she left the notebook in the hurry of being called to come to him in the early morning. She reported he answered the questions spontaneously and in the right order starting in such a way that the translator was confused because no question had been asked. At the end of that interview she cried [...] "…strange tears of ecstatic happiness, and went to her room to recover the composure which had been shaken by these surprising and illuminating events." [...] This list of questions is referred to in another briefer recollection. Anise Rideout had a similar record of the incident. Rideout reports that `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote an inscription in Farmer's Bible dated March 26. For Maria Wilson's part she also joined the religion and was the first Bahá'í to move to Boston.|$|E

6000|$|And to this day, if {{you meet}} Nutkin {{up a tree}} and <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Friend of mine, Miss," [...] he said, {{indicating}} Wrayson. [...] "Knew {{my brother}} well, {{lived in the}} flat just below him, in fact. Perhaps you'd like to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> few questions." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{little later}} in our {{conversation}} I <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> simple little question about the liability of workingmen to accidents, and received a statistical lecture in return.|$|R
