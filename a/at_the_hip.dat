25|$|A 2011 review {{reported}} a small benefit of physical exercise on bone density of postmenopausal women. The chances {{of having a}} fracture were also slightly reduced (absolute difference 4%). People who exercised had on average less bone loss (0.85% at the spine, 1.03% <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip).</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, when gussets were added for {{room for the}} bust, stays became known as corsets. They also {{lengthened}} to the hip and the lower tabs were replaced by gussets <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> and had less boning. The shoulder straps disappeared in the 1840s for normal wear.|$|E
25|$|Shorter legs, without joints <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip,</b> are {{sometimes}} {{used to create}} minifigures which are shorter in stature than standard figures. Such pieces were first created for Star Wars sets but have since been used elsewhere, although primarily in licensed sets. Other legs include Genie smoke legs, mermaid tail legs, and Squid Warrior legs.|$|E

25|$|Dr Bainbridge of St Martin's Lane and Surgeon Lawrence {{attended}} {{him at the}} Angel Tavern {{and debated}} whether his leg should be amputated. When told he would lose his leg <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip,</b> Mynn, a sincerely religious man, asked {{for a few minutes}} to say his prayers. In those minutes the doctors decided not to operate and instead had him sent to St Bartholomew's Hospital. After two years convalescence, he fully recovered.|$|E
25|$|The two hip bones {{connect the}} spine {{with the lower}} limbs. They are {{attached}} to the sacrum posteriorly, connected to each other anteriorly, and joined with the two femurs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> joints. The gap enclosed by the bony pelvis, called the pelvic cavity, is the section of the body underneath the abdomen and mainly consists of the reproductive organs (sex organs) and the rectum, while the pelvic floor {{at the base of the}} cavity assists in supporting the organs of the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|Whether in {{the main}} sweep or in an {{individual}} stop's sweep, the same tactics would be applied. The sweepline would proceed forward with each soldier scanning line of sight ahead through the bush and undergrowth. The speed of this movement varied depending on the terrain and density of the bush, but when the troops sensed enemy ahead the sweep slowed markedly, edging forward inch by inch, rifles at ready and pointed ahead with the safety catches off. MAG gunners would bear the gun <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip,</b> held by a sling from their shoulders.|$|E

50|$|Hammock-style swings vary in {{the number}} of {{suspension}} points from three (two <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hips</b> and one <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head), to four (two <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hips</b> and two <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shoulders), to five (two each at hips and shoulders, plus one <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head). The functional difference between these variants lies in the stability of the sling when in use: the more suspension points, the less movement. However, many users prefer to have a greater range of movement.|$|R

25|$|A jockstrap (also {{known as}} a jock, jock strap, strap, supporter, or {{athletic}} supporter) is an undergarment for supporting the male genitalia during cycling, contact sports or other vigorous physical activity. A jockstrap consists of a waistband (usually elastic) with a support pouch for the genitalia and two elastic straps affixed {{to the base of}} the pouch and to the left and right sides of the waistband <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip.</b> The pouch, in some varieties, may be fitted with a pocket to hold an abdominal guard (impact resistant cup, box) to protect the testicles and the penis from injury.|$|E
25|$|Trousers {{underwent}} a notable {{change in the}} 1820s. The new fit {{was a product of}} the French Revolution as it was considered uncouth to wear attire that looked wealthy. The length of the pant changed from below the knee to below the ankle and the fit of the pant loosened slightly from {{the first decade of the}} 19th century. The pants featured a small waistline and flared out slightly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> with small pleats, creating the image of fullness in the hip region. The introduction of straps that went under the foot, known as stirrup pants, also changed the shape and fit of these trousers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the normal}} {{anatomy of the}} hip joint, the root (the thigh bone) is {{connected}} to the pelvis <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> joint. The almost spherical end of the femur head (the caput, or caput ossis femoris) fits into the acetabulum (a concave socket located in the pelvis). The bony surfaces of the femur head and of the acetabulum are covered by cartilage. While bones provide the strength necessary to support body weight, cartilage ensures a smooth fit and a wide range of motion. Normal hip function can be affected by congenital conditions such as dysplasia, discussed in this article, trauma, and by acquired diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E

25|$|Osteoporosis {{may be due}} {{to lower}} than normal bone mass and greater than normal bone loss. Bone loss {{increases}} after menopause due to lower levels of estrogen. Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments including alcoholism, anorexia, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and surgical removal of the ovaries. Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glucocorticosteroids. Not enough exercise and smoking are also risk factors. Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density of 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young adult. This is typically measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip.</b>|$|E
25|$|His private {{practice}} had become very considerable, his position having been assured {{ever since his}} amputation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> joint in 1823, the first operation of the kind in Scotland. In 1833 he succeeded Prof James Russell as Professor of Clinical Surgery in Edinburgh University. Syme's accession to the clinical chair was marked by two important changes in the conditions of it: the first was that the professor should have the care of surgical patients in the infirmary in right of his professorship, and the second, that attendance on his course should be obligatory on all candidates for the medical degree. When Liston removed to London in 1835 Syme became the leading consulting surgeon in Scotland.|$|E
25|$|Charmaine's {{body was}} {{initially}} stowed {{in the coal}} cellar of Midland Road until Fred was released from prison. He would later bury her naked body in the yard close {{to the back door}} of the flat, and although he remained adamant he had not dismembered this particular victim, a subsequent autopsy suggested the body had been severed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> (although this damage may have been caused by building work Fred conducted at the property in 1976). In addition, several bones—particularly patellae, finger, wrist, toe and ankle bones—were missing from her skeleton, leading to the speculation the missing parts had been retained as keepsakes (this would prove to be a distinctive discovery in all the autopsies of the victims exhumed in 1994).|$|E

50|$|The muscle {{also helps}} to medially rotate the tibia on the femur when the knee is flexed and medially rotate the femur when <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> is extended. It {{counteracts}} forward bending <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hips</b> as well.|$|R
25|$|The dynamic {{interactions}} between Spinal cord and sensory input are ensured by modulating transmission in locomotor pathways in a state- and phase-dependent manner. For instance, proprioceptive inputs from extensors can, during stance, adjust {{the timing and}} amplitude of muscle activities of the limbs to the speed of locomotion but be silenced during the swing phase of the cycle. Similarly, skin afferents participate predominantly in the correction of limb and foot placement during stance on uneven terrain, but skin stimuli can evoke different types of responses depending on when they occur within the step cycle. It {{is important to note}} that inputs from the hip appear to play a critical role in spinal locomotion. Experiments on spinal animals showed that when one limb is held with the hip flexed, locomotion on that side stops while the other limb continues walking. However, when the stopped limb is extended <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> joint to a point normally reached at the end of stance during walking, it suddenly flexes and starts walking again provided that the contralateral limb is a position to accept the weight of the hindquarters. Other work confirmed the importance of hip afferents for locomotor rhythm generation since flexion of the hip will abolish the rhythm whereas extension will enhance it.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{posterior}} thigh muscles. The biceps femoris has two heads: The long head has its origin on the ischial tuberosity {{together with the}} semitendinosus and acts on two joints. The short head originates from the middle third of the linea aspera on the shaft of the femur and the lateral intermuscular septum of thigh, and acts on only one joint. These two heads unite to form the biceps which inserts {{on the head of}} the fibula. The biceps flexes the knee joint and rotates the flexed leg laterally— it is the only lateral rotator of the knee and thus has to oppose all medial rotator. Additionally, the long head extends the hip joint. The semitendinosus and the semimembranosus share their origin with the long head of the biceps, and both attaches on the medial side of the proximal head of the tibia together with the gracilis and sartorius to form the pes anserinus. The semitendinosus acts on two joints; extension of the hip, flexion of the knee, and medial rotation of the leg. Distally, the semimembranosus' tendon is divided into three parts referred to as the pes anserinus profondus. Functionally, the semimembranosus is similar to the semitendinosus, and thus produces extension <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> joint and flexion and medial rotation at the knee.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 Carpenter {{provided}} a diagnosis. Due to his conclusion that Hesperosaurus were rather basal, in it many comparisons {{were made with}} the basalmost known stegosaurian Huayangosaurus, that lost their relevance once {{it became clear that}} the phylogenetic position was in fact quite derived. In 2008 Maidment indicated three autapomorphies: the possession of eleven back vertebrae; the fourth sacral not being fused to the sacrum; back plates that are longer (from front to rear) than tall. Maidment also provided some traits in which Hesperosaurus was more basal than Stegosaurus armatus. In the atlas, even in adult specimens the neural arches are not fused to the intercentrum. The postzygapophyses, the rear joint processes, of the rear neck vertebrae do not prominently protrude upwards. In the back vertebrae, the neural arches, above the level of the neural canal, are not especially lengthened to above. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> region ossified tendons are present. The ribs are expanded at their lower ends. The neural spines of the tail vertebrae are not bifurcated. The lower end of the pubic bone is expanded (spoon-shaped in side view). To Carpenter this differential diagnosis was problematic because he considered Stegosaurus armatus, the type species of Stegosaurus, a nomen dubium and rejected Maidment's lumping of all North-American Stegosaurus material into a single species, the great variability of which making it difficult to establish any differences with Hesperosaurus. He considered Stegosaurus stenops, the name historically given to several well-preserved specimens, a separate species and {{provided a}} new differential diagnosis of Hesperosaurus compared to S. stenops. The antorbital fenestra is large instead of very small. The maxilla is short and deep, half as tall as long, instead of having a height a third of the length. The basisphenoid of the lower braincase is short instead of long. Thirteen neck vertebrae are present instead of ten. Thirteen dorsal (back) vertebrae are present instead of seventeen. The middle dorsals have a basal form in possessing a low neural arch rather than a high one. The cervical ribs have expanded lower ends. In the front tail vertebrae, the tops of the neural spines are rounded instead of bifurcated. The front edge of the shoulderblade is indented instead of running parallel to the rear edge. The front blade of the ilium diverges strongly sideways instead of weakly. The rear blade of the ilium has a knob-shaped expansion at the rear end. The front end of the prepubic process has an upward expansion. The plates of the hip and tail base are oval and low instead of high and triangular.|$|E
