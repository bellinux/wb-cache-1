40|$|This study formulates Prusa's (1992) {{theory that}} <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>regulations</b> {{facilitate}} {{the formation of}} cartels between an exporter and import-competing firms. It demonstrates that interest rates and product differentiation are two key factors that may determine the robustness of the cartels. It builds a Bertrand duopoly model with differentiated products that explains how <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>regulations</b> might encourage the creation of cartels. To highlight {{the circumstances under which}} an import-competing firm is seriously hurt by dumped exports, this study adopts the following setting. First, both the exporter and the import-competing firms sell only in the home market. Second, if the exporter's product is sold at a cheaper price than the product of an import-competing firm in the home market, this is a sufficient condition to initiate an anti-dumping petition. Although the setting might also provide the circumstances under which the anti-dumping authority could be over-protecting the import-competing firm, it makes it possible to view the exporter as a predator. Since the setting enables the exporter to be free from the need to make profits in its own market, it sets a lower price for its product only if it decides to undertake predatory activities against an import-competing firm.

40|$|This mini-dissertation {{critically}} analyse {{the use of}} <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>regulations</b> between South Africa, the European Union and China. South Africa, the European Union and China are {{all members}} of the World Trade Organisation. Dumping is legally defined in terms of Article VI of the General Agreements Act on Tariffs and Trade as “a product that is exported from one country to another at a price less than a price at which like goods are sold from domestic consumption in the exporting country”. The only way to protect a country from dumping is to use their universal, legal instruments set out by the World Trade Organisation, namely the most commonly used trade remedy, anti-dumping, countervailing and subsidies and lastly safeguards. On the 14 th of November 2003, South Africa promulgated their <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>regulations</b> that had a broader overview regarding dumping than the previous legislation on this matter. Although there had been several opportunities to properly legislate anti-dumping substance and procedures, the existing South African legislation including the International Administration Act, still does not conform to the requirements and standards of the World Trade Organisation. In the early 20 th Century, a number of European countries came together and formulated an Anti-dumping Agreement and was also known as the European Union. The European Union is seen as one of the biggest trade actors in the world. In 1994 the European anti-dumping laws were laid down. Regarding to non-market economies, the European legislation did not have a lot of change during the last decade. The European Union conforms to the requirements and standards set out by the World Trade Organisation. On 25 March 1997 the state council of the People’s Republic of China promulgated anti-dumping and countervailing regulations. At this point in time, China is undergoing an economic transformation, but before China plays an important part in the World Trade Organisation, it must learn to use the World Trade Organisation and integrate the World Trade Organisation laws that are directly related to China by looking at the international trade’s advantages and disadvantages. China is under severe dumping and anti-dumping status quo, which is directly paired with the development of China's anti-dumping legislation where new demands are being brought forward. South Africa’s relationship regarding China, lead to a Memorandum of Understanding in December 1999 where the regional trade protocol was signed between the two countries in terms of textiles, that South Africa won’t impose any duties against China until December 2013, but antidumping duties can be imposed on any other country. South Africa and the European Union have not yet created such a relationship of that between South Africa and China, but South Africa and the European Union, both signed the Trade Development and Co-operation Agreement. This was the first bi-lateral framework agreement between South Africa and the European Union. The final ratification occurred in 2004 and was revised in March 2007. The international trade war against China and the European Union has been won by China, because the WTO recently {{came to the conclusion that}} the European Union’s trade policies against China were discriminatory. It should be mentioned that these three countries will play an important role in the development and implementation of international trade relations and regulations and by their collusion, it could only improve the visions of international trade.

40|$|PhDIn November 2001, the WTO members {{allowed the}} People's Republic of China, a {{formerly}} planned {{economy that is}} going through different stages of domestic economic and related legal restructuring, to accede to the WTO. This accession {{is believed to be}} necessary for the WTO to become a truly international organisation in the post-Cold War era, along side of the IMF and the World Bank, and for China to become an integrated member of the international economic community. Although the end of the Cold War has changed European trade policy profoundly, the European Community (EC) " has maintained a traditionally bifurcated trade policy, in which planned economies, also referred to as "non-market economies", are given treatment different from market economies in trade policy instruments, such as the EC emergency safeguards provisions and EC anti-dumping regulation. The EC perceives the Chinese domestic legal and economic reforms as unfinished; and, although the treatment of Chinese products under the EC import and <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>regulations</b> has been liberalised in recent years, China is still generally considered to be a non-market economy. It is questionable whether in light of China's WTO accession such a non-market approach vis-Ã¤-vis China, as approved in the Chinese Protocol of Accession, is justified. This thesis argues that the non-market approach for China, as it stands today, should be adjusted for two basic reasons. First, this approach does not allow China to benefit fully from its WTO accession {{for a number of years}} to come. Second, as long as the period allowing non-market economy treatment continues, the danger exists that the non-market economy trade policy, especially as far as anti-dumping is concerned, may tend to be abused for protectionist purposes by the EC. Protectionist abuse would be harmful for China because its export-oriented growth is necessary to advance the country's domestic legal and economic reforms. Protectionism, equally, would be harmful for the EC because it prevents the Community industry from adjusting itself to face the challenge of increased Chinese competition. Because there is no satisfactory methodological solution to deal with the new variant of non-market economies, and because it is impossible for China - despite all good intentions - to implement fully the WTO accession requirements by the time they must phase in, the suggested approach is for the EC to show restraint in employing these trade policy instruments against China. As far as emergency safeguards are concerned, this restraint is already a fact. Nonetheless, some holdovers from the Cold War should be put up for change. Such adjustments will also be required for the EC anti-dumping regulation...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{mechanism}} of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>regulation</b> is a specific instrument for promoting competition in transition economies, the anti-dumping {{should be viewed as}} a very important component of the trade policy. The main criteria which are traditionally used in determination of the normal value of product should be adapted to the specificity of production in the transition period. Anti-dumping sanctions are the most common tools in a well-directed struggle with the most competitive foreign products. Therefore antidumping can be regarded as a constitutive and very important part of the trade policy. Its application tends to expand in connection with the development of globalization processes. Developed countries are actively using anti-dumping measures and countervailing duties against foreign competitors.

40|$|This paper {{critically}} analyses {{the use of}} <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>regulation</b> in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) {{with specific}} reference to Botswana. Dumping takes place where products are introduced into the commerce of another country at less than its normal value, if the export price of the product exported {{from one country to}} another is less than the comparable price, in the ordinary course of trade, for the like product when destined for consumption in the exporting country. Anti-dumping duties are an internationally-recognised exception to three core WTO principles namely, bound tariff commitments, most-favoured-nation MFN) and national treatment. The use of anti-dumping in SACU has always been in accordance with existing WTO rules. The new SACU Agreement has important implications for the anti-dumping regime within the customs union. It changed the way in which tariff decisions, including anti-dumping tariffs, are made and it also requires member states to develop legislation on contingency trade remedies such as anti-dumping for the region and to establish national bodies to administer these remedies within different countries. The SACU council has given mandate to the International Trade Administration Commission of South Africa (ITAC) to undertake all trade remedies investigations and imposition of the necessary duties. From the inception of ITAC till now ninety-five percent (95 %) of all anti-dumping applications filed at ITAC alleging dumping are instituted by South Africa industries. Thus, only five percent (5 %) of all anti-dumping applications are from Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland (BLNS countries). The findings in this paper reveal that Botswana has never filed an application seeking protection of any of its industries. In terms of Article 14 of the SACU Agreement Botswana {{is in the process of}} establishing its national body like ITAC. The argument is that, since Botswana has never filed for any trade remedy how effective will this national body going to be? Therefore, critically analyzing the use of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>regulation</b> is very crucial for Botswana as a SACU member. Such analysis will help assess the effectiveness of SACU institutions such as the tariff board and the Botswana national body to be established. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|The report {{identifies}} {{concerns with}} the EU anti-dumping instrument, as applied today, {{regardless of the}} fact that the investigation procedures and methods might be in line with the current regulation and practice. The report's arguments are based on the recent anti-dumping investigation – and imposition of anti-dumping measures – on imports of ceramic tiles from China, but the observations and conclusions from the analysis are valid for most EU anti-dumping investigations. The report observes that price dumping is evaluated differently depending on whether the product is manufactured in the EU or imported from third countries. What is considered to be price dumping when imported is considered normal competition for a product manufactured in the EU. This is due to the fact that spatial price differentiation within the EU is covered by competition rules, and that competition rules have higher requirements for market share and price undercutting than the anti-dumping legislation. The report, accordingly, advocates that the criteria for imposing anti-dumping duties should be harmonized to the EU competition rules in order to ensure fair competition on the EU market. In the absence of a reformed <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>regulation,</b> the <b>anti-dumping</b> measures will most likely only contribute to a distorted competition where the complaining EU manufacturing industry will be protected to the detriment of the consumers. ...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary Australia is {{entering}} a new period of economic transition. The realities of an increasingly globalised international economy bring to Australia both great opportunities and great challenges. In ensuring {{that the benefits of}} a more connected global economy in Australia are realised, however, robust regulatory mechanisms must be in place to ensure international entities trading within the Australian market are doing so {{in a way that is}} consistent with Australian and international law, and the spirit of the trade deals Australia has entered into. This report examines Australia’s anti-dumping framework, the regulatory system that enables the federal government to monitor and respond to cases of predatory dumping in the country. Predatory dumping, the act of a country or entity flooding a foreign market with excess products at below-market cost in order to limit long-term competition in that market, has been a challenge for the international trading system for generations. Indeed, the multilateral agreements at the heart of the the global trading system – those that form the basis of the World Trade Organisation – recognise the need for countries to have robust mechanisms in place to respond to cases of predatory dumping. In doing so, countries are not only able to ensure that fairness in the global trading system is maintained, they are similarly able to promote confidence in this trading system to their own population. Bolstering public confidence in trade is essential to its ongoing success, and anti-dumping frameworks are central to maintaining this public confidence. This report begins by outlining 10 key recommendations aimed at improving Australia’s antidumping framework, which is limited in its ability to adequately support Australian industries subject to predatory dumping. The recommendations include calls for greater resource allocation, better data collection and publishing, as well as granting the AntiDumping Commission – the body charged with overseeing Australia’s <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>regulations</b> – greater abilities to punish entities circumventing Australian law. The five key findings of this report are then outlined. This report has identified that characterisation of China as a Full Market Economy has severely curtailed Australia’s ability to respond to predatory dumping emanating from the Chinese market. Another impediment to the system is the overall lack of resources allocated towards it, and the challenge the Anti-Dumping Commission faces when intending to impose interim duties on entities circumventing Australian trade law. Additionally, this report has found that the process for average Australian businesses wishing to pursue an anti-dumping case can be extremely expensive, which limits the equitable access to the system...|$|E

40|$|Economic {{theory and}} {{empirical}} evidence suggest that governments might usefully intervene in high-technology competition in two ways: First, they could {{act as a}} neutral agent that creates the necessary credibility, commitment and mutual trust among private companies so as to facilitate cooperation in high-risk, high-volume R&D. Second, if — {{in view of the}} externalities involved — an element of subsidization is to be added, this could be done in a nondiscriminatory fashion. A favourable tax treatment of R&D expenditures may be the most appropriate tool to achieve this task. In practice, governments do engage in targeted industrial and technology policies, whether justified on economic grounds or not. As a consequence, the string of trade conflicts in hightech industries that began in the 1980 s is unlikely to end in the near future, unless substantial reforms are undertaken in some crucial areas of the international trade order. Above all, appropriate reform steps should be made with a view to the regulations on (i) subsidies, (ii) structural impediments, and (iii) dumping and anti-dumping. To mitigate the frictions that arise from a subsidization of domestic firms, a new set of rules should be established. The rules should provide that all plans to grant or to alter existing subsidies are to be notified to and approved by the WTO. Moreover, all subsidies should be ranked according to their potential distortional effects on competition and trade. For each category, quantitative limits that constrain the provision of subsidies to a certain fraction of the subsidy base should be set. To facilitate further liberalization steps, a country should be allowed to exceed these limits, if a national subsidy program offers an open access to firms located in third markets. Besides restrictive business practices of private firms, government regulations and technical standards are the most important structural impediments to trade. Existing GATT Articles already offer a multilateral route to conflict resolution in cases of structural impediments. However, this route has not been used by complainants up to now. The so-called "non-violation" clause of Article 23 GATT provides access to a multilateral dispute settlement even if the defending country has not explicitly violated GATT rules. This route should be tested and, if necessary, improved. To reduce the potential for a protectionist abuse of existing <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>regulations,</b> explicit reference to the state of competition in the relevant exporting and importing country markets should be made in anti-dumping investigations. To meet specific anti-trust concerns in hightech competition — notably with respect to network externalities, systems leverage, standardization, and innovation cartels — one might consider adopting the Draft International Antitrust Code (DIAC) that has recently been proposed by an international group of legal experts.

40|$|Dumping can {{be defined}} as {{exporting}} goods at prices below those charged on the domestic market or at prices insufficient to recover the cost of the goods sold. Dumping is considered an unfair trading practice because it interferes with free market economy principles. During the 1980 s, anti-dumping measures were an important issue for a few developed countries that had attractive markets for foreign producers; these countries were the United States, the European Community, Canada, and Australia. The European Community (EC) has developed its own anti-dumping laws over the years; Article 113 of the EEC Treaty gives power to Community institutions to take action against dumped products from third countries. This EEC regulation was first adopted in 1968, and amended several times until 1994. In 1994, the United States and 110 other countries signed the Final Act Embodying the Results of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. One of the multilateral agreements under the Uruguay Round is a new anti-dumping code. In response to this new code, the EC Council adopted a new EC <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>regulation</b> which implemented the Uruguay Round anti-dumping agreement. This paper examines the relevant issues in past EC anti-dumping proceedings, and compares past practice with the revised rules in the new regulation.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Commission of the European Community has made Korea one of three main target {{countries}} of anti-dumping measures, because Korea is pressing to export more of the electronics products which the Community is struggling to protect, study of the Community Antidumping Law in Korea has barely begun. Therefore, in this thesis, the measures that may be imposed by Community authorities with respect to trade with countries not members of the European Community, especially with Korea, under the Community <b>Anti-dumping</b> <b>Regulation,</b> {{in the context of the}} GATT Anti-dumping system are explained and analysed. With regard to the Community's anti-dumping rules, protectionist bias in their application is examined, in particular the determination of normal value and export price, constructed normal value and constructed export price, the comparison of normal value and export price, the calculation of dumping margin, and the determination of injury, and proposals are made as to the extent to which the Community anti-dumping rules need to be revised to diminish the bias in their range that explicitly favours Community producers and a finding of dumping, in the context of the GATT rules. With regard to the Korean Anti-dumping rules, on the other hand, they are introduced, generally. Anti-dumping measures in Korea have not been applied properly in favour of Korean producers, mainly because of the lack of transparency and institutional inertia. Therefore, enactment of a special Act governing anti-dumping complaints, modelled on a unitary system rather than a bifurcated system, should be considered for the transparent and speedy investigations. Institutional inertia must be rectified, i. e., more precise definition is required in some terminologies, and provisions on cumulation and anti-circumvention should have been prescribed before their application. Through a comparative study of the anti-dumping laws in the Community and Korea, it becomes clear that various aspects of the technical methodology applied by the authorities in anti-dumping determinations have a tendency to make findings of dumping largely automatic and inevitable. Therefore, it must always be borne in mind that anti-dumping measures can be imposed only where dumping and resulting injury is actually established, not artificially. This study has looked at anti-dumping laws in the Community and Korea comparatively, in the context of the GATT Anti-dumping rules. The Community refers to GATT and the Code in the preamble of its <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>regulation,</b> which has no binding effect in Court, and adopts the regulation in accordance with existing international obligations, in particular those arising from Article VI of the GATT and from the GATT Anti-dumping Code. However, this does not ensure an interpretation in conformity with GATT rules and its spirit, because the wording of the GATT anti-dumping rules taken literally is very ambiguous and can be interpreted very differently. Therefore, a comparative study with the Community's antidumping rules and its practice as a legislative model should be very helpful, in order to improve the current Korean anti-dumping system, because the GATT anti-dumping rules can play a very limited role only as a guideline...|$|R
40|$|On December 11, 2016, Article 15 (a) (ii) of China’s Accession Protocol to the WTO will expire. The {{expiration}} of {{this provision}} terminates {{the right of}} WTO members’ to calculate anti-dumping duties against China {{on the basis of}} methodologies that “are not based on a strict comparison with domestic prices or costs in China”. In this context, this paper shall serve, first, as a reminder that the European Union will violate its WTO obligations under the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement (ADA) if the Union’s institutions continue - after December 11, 2016 - to adopt anti-dumping measures against China that are based on ‘non-market economy’ (NME) treatment of Chinese exports in anti-dumping investigations. Moreover, the 2009 EU <b>Anti-Dumping</b> <b>Regulation</b> will be vulnerable to legal challenge in the WTO dispute settlement mechanism “as such” if it is not brought into compliance with the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement by that date. These observations, however, do not prejudge the legality of EU anti-dumping measures – “as applied” - that the EU has (or will have) adopted against Chinese producers prior to the December deadline. The post- 2016 legality of already existing EU anti-dumping measures that are “not based on a strict comparison with domestic prices or costs in China” is particularly relevant in context of the rising amount of new EU AD measures and investigations against Chinese producers of steel and solar panels that the EU has imposed and initiated in the last 2 years.

The third part provides for a brief normative assessment of the systemic implications of EU non-compliance with the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement after December 2016 and hints at legally viable alternatives...|$|R
