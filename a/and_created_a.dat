5|$|Abandoned mercury mine {{processing}} sites often contain very {{hazardous waste}} piles of roasted cinnabar calcines. Water run-off from such sites is a recognized source of ecological damage. Former mercury mines may be suited for constructive re-use. For example, in 1976 Santa Clara County, California purchased the historic Almaden Quicksilver Mine <b>and</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> county {{park on the}} site, after conducting extensive safety and environmental analysis of the property.|$|E
5|$|As rain {{continued}} to fall, the slightly acidic rainwater dissolved the limestone. As limestone wore away, the groundwater {{came into contact}} with the land surface <b>and</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, weathering of the limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall only a few inches, but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both the flow of water and the types of vegetation that can take hold.|$|E

In 1874, Congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three-member Board of Commissioners.|$|E
