5|$|Like {{several other}} volcanoes in {{northern}} British Columbia, Level Mountain was volcanically active during past glacial periods. Its involvement with glaciation resulted in several interactions between magma and ice, affording multiple examples of glaciovolcanic processes. Evidence for contemporaneous volcanism and glaciation is widespread throughout the massif. This includes interlayered unconsolidated fluvioglacial and tuffaceous deposits, tills and glacial erratics {{at the base}} of tuffs and lava flows, lahars composed of till and <b>agglomerate,</b> tuyas on the uppermost surface of the shield and as outliers, till cemented by siliceous sinter and the presence of freshwater pillow basalts and volcano-glacial tuff breccias. It is possible that geothermal outputs at Level Mountain had an influence on dynamics of past ice sheets much like the modern Grímsvötn caldera is an important heat source beneath Vatnajökull in Iceland. However, like other large NCVP volcanoes, much of Level Mountain was formed prior to glaciation.|$|E
5|$|Royton's damp climate {{provided}} the ideal conditions for cotton spinning {{to be carried}} out without the cotton drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for mass production for the global market. By 1832, there were 12 steam powered mills in Royton, of which its former hamlets had begun to <b>agglomerate</b> as a town around the cotton factories, a number of small coalpits and new turnpike road from Oldham to Rochdale, which passed through the town centre. The Manchester, Oldham and Royton Railway and a goods yard was constructed in the 1860s, allowing improved transportation of textile goods and raw materials to and from the township. Neighbouring Oldham (which by the 1870s had emerged {{of the largest and most}} productive mill town in the world) had begun to encroach upon Royton's southern boundary, forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district. The demand for cheap cotton goods from this area prompted the flotation of cotton spinning companies; the investment was followed by the construction of 22 new cotton mills in Royton. Together with Oldham, at its peak the area was responsible for 13% of the world's cotton production.|$|E

An image analysis method for 3 D re-construction of particle shape from silhouette was developed to measure the envelope volume of dehydrated milk <b>agglomerates</b> (1 - 2 mm). With known true density of the powder, the intra-particular porosity of <b>agglomerates</b> could be estimated. It was found that intra-particular porosity increases with <b>agglomerates</b> diameter indicating a fractal structure with a fractal dimension of 2. 64. This allowed understanding the different behavior of large <b>agglomerates</b> settling and dissolving rapidly in water whilst small ones settle and dissolve slowly and must be avoided in a good instant powder...|$|R

The two main methods of carbon nanotube functionalization are covalent and non-covalent modifications. Because of their hydrophobic nature, carbon nanotubes tend to <b>agglomerate</b> hindering their dispersion in solvents or viscous polymer melts. The resulting nanotube bundles or aggregates reduce the mechanical performance of the final composite. The surface of the carbon nanotubes can be modified to reduce the hydrophobicity and improve interfacial adhesion to a bulk polymer through chemical attachment.|$|E

40|$|Couscous <b>agglomerates</b> {{are made}} from durum wheat {{semolina}} by the succession of 4 unit operations: agglomeration, rolling, cooking and drying. Rolling stage is conducted to give a spherical shape to the <b>agglomerates</b> and to separate them according to size criteria. Continuous rolling drum is used by industry, and {{for some of them}} it is composed of an inclined perforated cylinder rotating about its central axis. The rolling stage is one critical operation during the couscous grain processing, as rolling mainly determines the process yield, by generating significant mass flows of too small and too large <b>agglomerates</b> that could reach more than 60 % of the total mass flow. The objective of the present work is to investigate the rolling stage as a unit operation, to determine the rolling process efficiency and its contribution on the structuring mechanisms of the couscous <b>agglomerates.</b> We used specific rolling equipment at pilot scale. Two metal grids allow separating the <b>agglomerates</b> in three fractions: fine, medium, and large <b>agglomerates.</b> Durum wheat semolina was used as raw materials to generate the wet <b>agglomerates</b> by a standard procedure. We investigated (i) the screening efficiency by assessing the three fractions yield, (ii) the rolling efficiency by measuring the circularity of <b>agglomerates</b> after rolling; (iii) the secondary agglomeration mechanisms by comparing the size distributions of the <b>agglomerates</b> before and after rolling; and (iv) the impact of rolling conditions on the hydro-textural characteristics of <b>agglomerates.</b> Results demonstrated that the rolling operation induces slight changes {{in the structure of the}} <b>agglomerates</b> and generates secondary agglomeration mechanisms. The change in setting conditions of the rolling operation has no significant impact on the screening efficiency and on the hydro-textural characteristics of <b>agglomerates</b> (diameter, compactness, and water content).

Four types of fluidization behaviors, i. e., stable fluidization, <b>agglomerating</b> fluidization, gradual defluidization and fast defluidization, were expressly described and distinguished, instead of only two types (i. e., fluidization and defluidization) reported in the literature. Further investigation revealed that the occurrence {{of different types of}} fluidization behaviors was caused by the differences in the formation and growth of <b>agglomerates</b> under different fluidization conditions. Particularly, gradual or fast defluidization was caused by the continuous formation and growth of <b>agglomerates</b> in the whole process. However, if formation and growth of <b>agglomerates</b> could Finally reach equilibrium, <b>agglomerating</b> fluidization would occur without defluidization.

40|$|Spherical Ni 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3 (OH) 2 <b>agglomerates</b> were {{synthesized}} by the co-precipitation {{method in}} the presence of ammonia. The results show that the growth mechanism of spherical <b>agglomerates</b> follows three-stages, i. e. nucleation and anisotropic growth of single crystals; agglomeration of polycrystalline crystallites <b>agglomerated</b> by single crystal grains as primary particles to form embryonic agglomerates; formation, growth and consolidation of spherical <b>agglomerates</b> or particles by agglomeration of embryonic <b>agglomerates,</b> continued growth of individual crystals in the <b>agglomerates</b> and further attachment of primary particles. The first two stages are very fast while the last stage takes almost the entire process to complete. The main reason for the anisotropic growth of Ni 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3 (OH) 2 crystal is that crystal surface energy of E(001), E(100), E(101) and E(102) is different with E(001) being the highest.

25|$|The oxide {{particles}} then <b>agglomerate</b> to form {{large particle}} chains, which subsequently deposit {{on the walls}} of the tube as soot. The deposition is due to the large difference in temperature between the gas core and the wall causing the gas to push the particles outwards (this is known as thermophoresis). The torch is then traversed up and down the length of the tube to deposit the material evenly. After the torch has reached the end of the tube, it is then brought back to the beginning of the tube and the deposited particles are then melted to form a solid layer. This process is repeated until a sufficient amount of material has been deposited. For each layer the composition can be modified by varying the gas composition, resulting in precise control of the finished fiber's optical properties.|$|E
25|$|Most sieve {{analyses}} {{are carried out}} dry. But there are some applications {{which can only be}} carried out by wet sieving. This is the case when the sample which has to be analysed is e.g. a suspension which must not be dried; or when the sample is a very fine powder which tends to <b>agglomerate</b> (mostly < 45nbsp&µm) – in a dry sieving process this tendency would lead to a clogging of the sieve meshes and this would make a further sieving process impossible. A wet sieving process is set up like a dry process: the sieve stack is clamped onto the sieve shaker and the sample is placed on the top sieve. Above the top sieve a water-spray nozzle is placed which supports the sieving process additionally to the sieving motion. The rinsing is carried out until the liquid which is discharged through the receiver is clear. Sample residues on the sieves have to be dried and weighed.

DSC and XRPD studies showed that naproxen particles, crystallized in the presence of HPC and disintegrant did not undergo structural modifications. The dissolution rate of naproxen from the <b>agglomerates</b> could be controlled by the amount of included disintegrant, being enhanced as the latter was increased. Moreover, the results showed that when the disintegrants were included both intragranularly and extragranularly during agglomeration of naproxen particles, tablets containing these <b>agglomerates</b> dissolved at a faster rate than the tablets containing crystallized naproxen with the same amount of disintegrant incorporated only extragranularly by physical mixing. In conclusion, the properties of <b>agglomerated</b> crystals, such as flowability, compactibility and dissolution rate were improved profoundly using the developed technique resulting in successful direct tableting without need to additional process of physical blending of <b>agglomerates</b> and disintegrants. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|Steam-jet {{granulation}} is {{a process}} used in dairy industry to produce instant <b>agglomerated</b> milk powder. <b>Agglomerated</b> instant powders exhibit improved wettability and rehydration behaviour, which are essential attributes for coffee whiteners applications. Although {{there is a growing}} interest for research in this area, the steam-jet granulation process has been little studied to date and the quality control at industrial scale remains experimental and empirical. Moreover, the multi-factorial causes {{at the root of the}} rehydration properties of the final <b>agglomerates</b> make it difficult to identify the key process parameters that should be controlled to meet the quality requirements. The present study investigated industrial data to study how different raw materials properties and process parameters interact and contribute to the production of skim milk <b>agglomerates</b> with improved functional properties. Dynamic vapour sorption and differential scanning calorimetry were used to characterize both the native raw materials and the <b>agglomerated</b> powders. A multivariate data analysis was used to identify correlations between the raw material properties, the process parameters and the physicochemical and functional properties of the products. The water content of the native raw material and the post-drying temperature were found to be critical in controlling the humidity and thermodynamical properties (glass transition temperature) of the <b>agglomerates.</b> These properties were correlated to the wetting time and showed their significant influence on the rehydration behaviour of the <b>agglomerates.</b> Recommendations concerning production parameters are given to avoid conform rehydration behaviour in industrial <b>agglomerated</b> skim milk powder...|$|R
