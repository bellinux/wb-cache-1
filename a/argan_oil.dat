50|$|The {{decanted}} <b>argan</b> <b>oil</b> {{is left to}} rest {{about two}} weeks so that solids suspended in the <b>argan</b> <b>oil</b> settle to the bottom. The clearer <b>argan</b> <b>oil</b> is further filtered, depending on the required clarity and purity. Pure <b>argan</b> <b>oil</b> may contain some sediment.|$|E
40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the oxidative stability of <b>argan</b> <b>oils</b> by using peroxides and conjugated diene hydroperoxides measurements as analytical indicators. Both food and cosmetic <b>argan</b> <b>oils</b> were investigated. Their oxidative stability was also determined by monitoring the relative changes of their fatty acid profiles by 1 H NMR. In addition, valuable information regarding minor components as well as the acyl positional distribution, were obtained for both grades by high field 1 H and 13 C NMR, respectively. Given that the cosmetic and food grades have a similar profile and content of phenolic antioxidants, vitamers, and squalene, it appears that the ratio of fatty acid aliphatic to bisallylic CH 2 groups, much higher in <b>argan</b> <b>oils</b> than in other vegetable oils, is responsible for their higher thermal stability...|$|R
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} documented recipes for asida is found in an anonymously authored Hispano-Muslim cookbook dating to the 13th century. In the 13th and 14th centuries, in the mountainous region of the Rif along the Mediterranean coast of Morocco, a flour made from lightly grilled barley was used in place of wheat flour. A recipe for asida that adds <b>argan</b> seed <b>oil</b> was documented by Leo Africanus (c. 1465-1550), the Arab explorer known as Hasan al-Wazan in the Arab world.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{concern for}} consumed fat by western populations {{has raised the}} question of the level and the quality of fat intake, especially the composition of fatty acids (FA) and their impact on human health. As a consequence, consumers and nutritionists have requested updated publications on FA composition of food containing fat. In the present study, fourteen different kinds of edible oils (rapeseed, olive, hazelnut, argan, groundnut, grape seed, sesame, sunflower, walnut and organic walnut, avocado, wheat germ, and two combined oils) were analysed for FA determination using a BPX- 70 60 m highly polar GC column. Oils were classified according to the classification of Dubois et al. (2007, 2008). Monounsaturated FA (MUFA) group oils, including rapeseed, olive, hazelnut, and avocado oils, contained mainly oleic acid (OA). Groundnut and <b>argan</b> <b>oils,</b> also rich in MUFA, showed in addition high linoleic acid (LA) contents. In the polyunsaturated (PUFA) group, grape seed oil presented the highest LA content while sunflower, sesame, and wheat germ oils showed noticeable MUFA amounts in addition to high PUFA contents. Walnut oils, also rich in LA, showed the highest linolenic acid (ALA) content. The n- 6 /n- 3 ratio of each oil was calculated. Trans-FA (TFA) was also detected and quantified. Results were compared with the data published during the past decade, and the slight discrepancies were attributed to differences in origin and variety of seed-cultivars, and in seed and oil processes...|$|R

5000|$|In Morocco, arganeraie forests now cover some [...] and are {{designated}} as a UNESCO biosphere reserve. Their area has shrunk by about half during the last 100 years, due to charcoal-making, grazing, and increasingly intensive cultivation. The best hope {{for the conservation of}} the trees may lie in the recent development of a thriving export market for <b>argan</b> <b>oil</b> as a high-value product. However, the wealth brought by <b>argan</b> <b>oil</b> export has also created threats to argan trees in the form of increased goat population. Locals use the newfound wealth to buy more goats and the goats stunt the growth of the argan trees by climbing up and eating their leaves and fruit.|$|E
