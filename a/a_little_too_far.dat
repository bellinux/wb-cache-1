25|$|The unorthodox play of Higgins was {{encapsulated}} in his {{break of}} 69, made under unusual pressure, against Jimmy White in the penultimate frame of their World Professional Snooker Championship semi-final in 1982. Higgins was 0–59 {{down in that}} frame, but managed to compile an extremely challenging clearance during which he was scarcely in position until the colours. In particular, former world champion Dennis Taylor considers a three-quarter-ball pot on a blue into the green pocket especially memorable, {{not only for its}} extreme degree of difficulty but for enabling Higgins to continue the break and keep White off the table and unable to clinch victory at that moment. In potting the blue, Higgins screwed the cue-ball on to the side cushion to bring it back towards the black/pink area with extreme left-hand sidespin, a shot Taylor believes could be played 100 times without coming close to the position Higgins reached with cue-ball. He went <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> for ideal position on his next red but the match-saving break was still alive.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{commented that}} Stephenson seems to carry his {{understanding}} of the period <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> at times, delving into too much detail. Nick Hasted of The Independent wrote that this research made [...] "descriptions of Restoration London feel leaden, and intellectual discourses between Newton and his contemporaries textbook-dry." [...] Despite the thorough examination of the period, however, Stephenson does take liberty in depicting the Enlightenment. Both main and secondary fictional characters become prominent members of society who advise the most important figures of the period and affect everything from politics to economics and science. For example, he repopulates the real Cabal Ministry with fictional characters.|$|E

A spokesman for the BBC stated: [...] "We have listened to this song over and over again.

500|$|In 1749, a court {{decision}} made by Fielding – {{in his role as}} magistrate – provoked rumours that he was being paid to defend brothels. Three years later, a letter written by [...] "Humphry Meanwell" [...] voiced objection to the 1752 Disorderly House Act (25 Geo. II, c. 36), which was intended to remove prostitutes and brothels from Britain. The public soon associated this letter with Fielding; his publication of what was seen as an endorsement of the letter in the 22 June issue strengthened this feeling: [...] "The following Letter which was sent to the Justice by an unknown Hand, hath been transmitted to us; and tho' perhaps some Points are carried <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>far,</b> upon the whole I think it a very sensible Performance, and worthy the Attention of the Public."

Noting that a third of the set-list was made up of covers, she expressed dislike for Lewis' interpretation of [...] "Time After Time". Abbott wrote that her [...] "only real criticism" [...] of the performance was for the stage production, which she described as [...] "five strips of giant toilet paper hanging at the back, occasionally changing colour, and spaced <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> apart to make for easy viewing of the video footage of Leona explaining why her music is so important to her".

All {{of the songs}} of the album were written by Millard or the band except [...] "I Worship You", which was written by Kipley and Reggie Hamm. The band included the song after Kipley brought it to them; although the band wanted to write their own material, they liked the song {{so much that they}} put it as the first song on the album. [...] "Bless Me Indeed (Jabez's Song)" [...] was written {{at the request of the}} label, who wanted to capitalize off of the success of the popular Bruce Wilkinson book The Prayer of Jabez. The band did not want to record the song, but eventually acquiesced.

500|$|Gaga first {{performed}} an acoustic-jazz {{version of the}} song at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria in May 15, 2011. During the song, she revealed that her record company had told her to keep new material to a minimum, {{but she said she}} wanted to air the track in full. Another piano version of the song was performed on May 21, 2011, on the season finale of Saturday Night Live, where Gaga wore a metallic black dress, knee-high boots and a semi-circular metallic headdress. The full version was first performed at the final show of American Idol season 10 on May 25, 2011, where she was joined by Clemons in person. Gaga appeared perched atop a mountain top on the [...] "Idol" [...] stage, dressed in a long cape and a bedazzled headpiece. A trio of dancers were {{at the base of the}} set performing choreographed dance steps while Gaga sang from the top. At the end of the performance, Gaga and a dancer embraced each other, took a breath and then jumped off the edge of the stage, landing out of sight on a bed of fake rocks, as steam shot up high in the air. Len Melisurgo from The Star-Ledger felt that the performance was too [...] "sexually suggestive" [...] for the audience of American Idol and wondered whether Gaga [...] "went just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> for a family-oriented show that's geared toward a younger audience?" [...] Conversely, Adam Graham from MTV News listed it as one of Gaga's most memorable television performances. Monica Herrera from Billboard listed it as the fourth best performance of the night, and felt that Gaga [...] "channeled Bruce Springsteen" [...] in her personality.|$|E

This fresh approach to telling the adventures reveals two boys quite foreign to how they have been portrayed before, egotistical and jealous, and longtime readers will find few connections with the boys' previous personalities. The boys' Aunt Gertrude becomes [...] "Trudy", their mother Laura is given {{a career as a}} librarian, and their father is semi-retired. The boys are given their cases by a secret group known as ATAC, an acronym for American Teens Against Crime. In this new series, the Hardy Boys seem [...] "more like regular kids – who have lots of wild adventures – in these books, which also deal with issues that kids today might have thought about.

[...] The Hardys are also featured in a new graphic novel series, begun in 2005 and produced by Papercutz, and a new early chapter book series called The Hardy Boys: Secret Files, begun in 2010 by the publisher Simon & Schuster under their Aladdin imprint. The last Undercover Brothers books were released in January 2012 (main series) and July 2012 (Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys Super Mystery'07 series). [...] At the time of cancellation, there was one book that had been announced, but was ultimately shelved (The Case Of The MyFace Kidnapper); it is unknown whether {{this was going to be}} the final title of this unpublished book, since many bookstore websites and Simon & Schuster's website always had the letters [...] "W.T."

In the build-up to the event, several drivers expressed unease at the race - with Franchitti, Oriol Servià and Alex Lloyd the most vocal opponents - particularly given the high degree of banking around the circuit, with between 18 and 20 degrees of banking in the corners. Franchitti was quoted as saying that the track was [...] "not suitable" [...] for IndyCar racing, while championship rival Will Power - himself a staunch critic of short-track oval racing - described the race as [...] "an accident waiting to happen".|$|R

The production was more European orientated, with the massive synths and that stuff actually did it really well in Europe, especially in Germany, 'Celebrate Youth' was a hit." [...] Springfield considers Tao to be his finest album to date. [...] "We just had a lot of new ideas. It is probably the one I experimented on the most. Whatever I thought of we tried it. It was just when sampling was just starting, we got really into the drum sampling. But we started on just <b>a</b> DMX. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> DMX drum machine, all the original drum tracks were laid down on that, and then we triggered other drum samples from that. It was built up track by track. That is still my favorite album." [...] Springfield recalls, [...] "I had stopped listening to American rock by 1984.

5000|$|Eurogamer's James Lyon {{gave the}} PC version 5 out of 10. Like most critics, he was {{critical}} of the combat system, writing [...] "the real problem with The Da Vinci Code is that it doesn't really know who to appeal to.

[...] Kaiser went on to compliment series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, stating [...] "some of the more recent formal experiments that the show has done, such as the hour-long murder mystery in this season's premiere, indicate that MacFarlane and company agree with the criticism." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "I have to give props to Family Guy for going outside their wheelhouse without winking excessively at their audience, but I think it may have been <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>too</b> <b>far</b> to be truly great." [...] Kaiser ultimately gave the episode a B rating, the best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'" [...] and The Simpsons episode [...] "Moms I'd Like to Forget". In another positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's [...] "funniest moments," [...] which included the opening sequence involving Peter and the Red Bull, as well as the reference to The Price Is Right. Hughes went on to comment that the episode [...] "taught us about the depths and bonds of love that make a family. Whether it's acceptance, hope or sacrifice, there's no limit to what we will do for family." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also commented positively on the episode, writing in her review of the storyline, [...] "Overall, I found the installment to be refreshing with everyone taking a part in Peter’s dilemma.

Superman, the inspiration for the Legion, now has to learn from them how to be a hero.

Classic Legion villains such as the Fatal Five, Starfinger, and the Sun-Eater were included, and other Legionnaires, including Blok, Dream Girl, Element Lad, Shrinking Violet, Star Boy, Sun Boy, and Tyroc, made cameo appearances. Season 2 takes place two {{years after the end of}} Season 1. New members, such as Chameleon Boy, have joined the Legion.

2500|$|Vine's cricket {{career was}} not one of a rapid rise to fame. Although he played his first {{first-class}} match in 1896, it was not until 1900, after some tentative appearances in the three previous seasons, that he earned a regular place in the Sussex eleven. After that, however, he was indispensable. He was essentially a county cricketer, nearly all his work having been done for Sussex, but if, in addition to his batting and fielding, he had managed to retain his skill as a leg-break bowler it is quite likely that he would have played for England before he played his two Test matches in 1911/2. Already a dependable player, he made a great advance as a batsman in 1904 and during 1905 he was better than he had ever been before, scoring for Sussex in county matches alone over sixteen hundred runs. Good as his position is he would probably have been thought still more of if he had belonged to another county. A batsman would need to be great indeed to play on the same side as Ranjitsinhji and C.B. Fry, and not be overshadowed. His success as a batsman was largely gained in a series of first-wicket partnerships with Fry, and though he may at times carry caution <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> and keep an undue check on his hitting powers, the result is nearly always so satisfactory that it would be sheer hypercriticism to find fault with him. As an outfield Vine has not the wonderful pick-up of Denton, but in every other respect was in the highest class, {{and in the course of}} a season at the beginning of the twentieth century, perhaps no one saved a larger number of runs.|$|E
2500|$|Cardinal Pierre-Marie Gerlier of Lyon, {{a staunch}} anti-Semite who {{supported}} Vichy's efforts {{to solve the}} [...] "Jewish question" [...] in France thus far, opposed the rafles of Jews, arguing in a sermon that the [...] "Final Solution to the Jewish Question" [...] was taking things <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> (his [...] "solution" [...] to the [...] "Jewish question" [...] was conversion of the Jews to Roman Catholicism). Archbishop Jules-Géraud Saliège of Toulouse in a pastoral letter of 23 August 1942 declared about the deportations: [...] "You cannot do whatever you wish against these men, against these women, against these fathers and mothers. They are part of mankind. They are our brothers". Pastor Marc Boegner, president of the National Protestant Federation, denounced the rafles in a sermon in September 1942, asking Calvinists to hide Jews. A number of Catholic and Calvinist schools and organizations such as Jesuit Père Pierre Chaillet's l'Amitié Chrétienne began to take in Jewish children and passed them off as Christian. Many Protestant families, influenced by memories of persecution, {{had already begun to}} hide Jews, and after the summer of 1942, the Catholic Church, which until then had been broadly supportive of Vichy's anti-Semitic laws, began to condemn racial anti-Semitism and organized efforts to hide Jews. The official story was that the Jews were being [...] "resettled in the East", being moved to a [...] "Jewish homeland" [...] said to exist somewhere in Eastern Europe, but right from the start, there were disturbing rumors that the Jews were actually being killed. As 1942 went on, the fact that no one knew precisely where this [...] "Jewish homeland in the East" [...] was or had seen it together with the fact that those sent to be [...] "resettled in the East" [...] were never seen or heard from again led more and more people to the correct conclusion that the horrific rumors of the Jews were in fact being all exterminated were true.|$|E
