5|$|In applied mathematics, as we {{have done}} here, the delta {{function}} is often manipulated {{as a kind of}} limit (a weak limit) of <b>a</b> <b>sequence</b> of functions, each member of which has a tall spike at the origin: for example, <b>a</b> <b>sequence</b> of Gaussian distributions centered at the origin with variance tending to zero.|$|E
5|$|A gene is <b>a</b> <b>sequence</b> of DNA that {{contains}} genetic information and {{can influence the}} phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins {{is determined by the}} rules of translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from <b>a</b> <b>sequence</b> of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E

The path is always defined, though the defined path may be empty (zero length), therefore no trailing slash.|$|E
40|$|During {{the course}} of infection, {{elements}} of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) genome undergo inversion, {{a process that is}} believed to occur through the viral <b>a</b> <b>sequences.</b> To investigate the mechanism of this recombinational event, we have developed an assay that detects the deletion of DNA segments flanked by directly repeated <b>a</b> <b>sequences</b> in plasmids transiently maintained in Vero cells. With this assay, we have observed a high frequency of recombination (approximately 8 %) in plasmids that undergo replication in HSV- 1 -infected cells. We also found a low level of recombination between <b>a</b> <b>sequences</b> in plasmids introduced into uninfected cells and in unreplicated plasmids in HSV- 1 -infected cells. In replicating plasmids, recombination between <b>a</b> <b>sequences</b> occurs at twice the frequency seen with directly repeated copies of <b>a</b> different <b>sequence</b> of similar size. Recombination between <b>a</b> <b>sequences</b> appears to occur at approximately the same time as replication, suggesting that the processes of replication and recombination are closely linked...|$|R

5|$|Genes are {{the primary}} units of {{inheritance}} in all organisms. A gene is a unit of heredity and corresponds to a region of DNA that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways. All organisms, from bacteria to animals, share the same basic machinery that copies and translates DNA into proteins. Cells transcribe a DNA gene into an RNA version of the gene, and a ribosome then translates the RNA into <b>a</b> <b>sequence</b> of amino acids known as a protein. The translation code from RNA codon to amino acid {{is the same for}} most organisms. For example, <b>a</b> <b>sequence</b> of DNA that codes for insulin in humans also codes for insulin when inserted into other organisms, such as plants.|$|E
