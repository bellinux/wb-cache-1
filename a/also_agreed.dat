The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top political body, and the UN <b>also</b> <b>agreed</b> to use NATO air strikes in response to attacks on any of the other safe areas in Bosnia. The participants at the conference <b>also</b> <b>agreed</b> in principle to the use of large-scale NATO air strikes in response to future acts of Serb aggression.|$|E
5|$|The {{parties to}} the accord <b>also</b> <b>agreed</b> to the {{deployment}} of a UN peacekeeping mission in Croatia, which was later authorized through United Nations Security Council Resolution 721 of 27 November, following a formal request for deployment of the peacekeepers submitted by the Yugoslav government the previous day.|$|E

5|$|As {{an effect}} of Waddington's intervention, Romania <b>also</b> <b>agreed</b> {{to resolve the issue}} of Jewish Emancipation. The {{government}} pledged itself to naturalize all of its non-Christian residents (see History of the Jews in Romania). Kogălniceanu himself made efforts to overturn this decision, and was bitter when the Germans refused to compromise. The resolution was debated inside Romania over the following year, and such a measure in respect to Jews was not introduced until 1922–1923.|$|E
5|$|Charles Ebbets, {{owner of}} the Brooklyn Dodgers, viewed Tinker as a good {{replacement}} for the released Bob Fisher, their shortstop in 1913. The Cubs, Giants, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Philadelphia Phillies were also interested in acquiring Tinker. Ebbets secured Tinker's release from the Reds for $15,000, with another $10,000 {{to be paid to}} Tinker. The teams <b>also</b> <b>agreed</b> to swap players, with Earl Yingling and Herbie Moran going to Cincinnati and Dick Egan joining Brooklyn. Ebbets entered contract negotiations with Tinker.|$|E

5|$|Stanford <b>also</b> <b>agreed</b> to {{the honor}} the {{collective}} bargaining agreement which The JBG Cos. had with UNITE HERE Local 25. About 125 to 135 people, most of them with 20 years of job tenure at the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, were affected by the closure.

5|$|The delegates <b>also</b> <b>agreed</b> with Madison {{that the}} {{executive}} function {{had to be}} independent of the legislature. In their aversion to kingly power, American legislatures had created state governments where the executive was beholden to the legislature, and by the late 1780s this was widely seen as being a source of paralysis. The Confederation government was the ultimate example of this.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of Matthias as king {{was the only}} way of avoiding a protracted civil war. Ladislaus Garai was the first baron to yield. At a meeting with Matthias's mother and uncle, he promised that he and his allies would promote Matthias's election, and Michael Szilágyi promised that his nephew would never seek vengeance for Ladislaus Hunyadi's execution. They <b>also</b> <b>agreed</b> that Matthias would marry the Palatine's daughter Annahis executed brother's bride.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later in 1974, {{researchers}} including Glenn T. Seaborg and Albert Ghiorso at the University of California, Berkeley, and E. Kenneth Hulet from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, also synthesized the element by bombarding a californium-249 target with oxygen-18 ions, using equipment similar to that which had been used for the synthesis of element 104 five years earlier, observing at least seventy alpha decays, seemingly from the isotope seaborgium-263m with a half-life of 0.9±0.2seconds. The alpha daughter rutherfordium-259 and granddaughter nobelium-255 had previously been synthesised and the properties observed here matched with those previously known, as did the intensity of their production. The cross-section of the reaction observed, 0.3nanobarns, <b>also</b> <b>agreed</b> well with theoretical predictions. These bolstered the assignment of the alpha decay events to seaborgium-263m.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} {{approximately}} 16,000 German citizens {{fought in the}} Civil War, mostly as pilots, ground crew, artillery men, tank crew, and as military advisers and instructors.

German aid to the Nationalists amounted to approximately £43,000,000 ($215,000,000) in 1939 prices. This was broken down in expenditure to: 15.5% used for salaries and expenses, 21.9% used for direct delivery of supplies to Spain, and 62.6% expended on the Condor Legion. No detailed list of German supplies furnished to Spain has been found. Franco had <b>also</b> <b>agreed</b> to sign over the output of six mines to help pay for German aid.|$|E
5|$|After the 1919 season, {{representatives of}} four Ohio League teams—the Canton Bulldogs, the Cleveland Tigers, the Dayton Triangles, and the Akron Pros—called {{a meeting on}} August 20, 1920, to discuss the {{formation}} of a new league. At the meeting, they tentatively agreed on a salary cap and pledged not to sign college players or players already under contract with other teams. They <b>also</b> <b>agreed</b> on a name for the circuit: the American Professional Football Conference. They then invited other professional teams to a second meeting on September 17.|$|E
