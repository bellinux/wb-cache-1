50|$|Internal waves, {{also called}} {{internal}} gravity waves, go by many other names {{depending upon the}} fluid stratification, generation mechanism, amplitude, and influence of external forces. If propagating horizontally along an interface where the density rapidly decreases with height, they are specifically called interfacial (internal) waves. If the interfacial waves are large amplitude they are called internal solitary waves or internal solitons. If moving vertically through the atmosphere where substantial changes in air density influences their dynamics, they are called <b>anelastic</b> (internal) waves. If generated by flow over topography, they are called Lee waves or mountain waves. If the mountain waves break aloft, they can result in strong warm winds at the ground known as Chinook winds (in North America) or Foehn winds (in Europe). If generated in the ocean by tidal flow over submarine ridges or the continental shelf, they are called internal tides. If they evolve slowly compared to the Earth's rotational frequency so that their dynamics {{are influenced by the}} Coriolis effect, they are called inertia gravity waves or, simply, inertial waves. Internal waves are usually distinguished from Rossby waves, which are influenced by the change of Coriolis frequency with latitude.|$|E

That type of relaxation, due to the motion of dislocations without the participation of mobile point defects, is known as [...] "Bordoni relaxation"’ or [...] "Bordoni peak", since it appears as a peak in the elastic energy dissipation versus temperature. Bordoni pursued this type of investigations, extending it to other metals with face-centered cubic structure, like copper, silver, gold, palladium, platinum [...] but also body-centered cubic structure, like niobium, and with anisotropic hexagonal structure, where the simple change of temperature causes plastic phenomena. Models of increasing sophistication {{have been developed to}} explain the complex phenomenology of the Bordoni relaxation, but there is not yet general consensus on the detailed microscopic mechanisms, and this is still now a field of active research,.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I discuss {{a series of}} <b>anelastic</b> approximations and detail the {{assumptions}} used in the derivation. I derive an entropy and temperature formulation of the <b>anelastic</b> approximation along with a simplification to the entropy formulation introduced by Lantz (1992) and independently by Braginsky & Roberts (1995). I assess range of applicability of the <b>anelastic</b> approximation, which is often used in describing the dynamics of geophysical and astrophysical flows. I consider two linear problems: magneto convection and magnetic buoyancy and compare the fully compressible solutions with those determined by solving the <b>anelastic</b> problem. I further compare the Lantz-Braginsky simplification with the full <b>anelastic</b> formulation which I find to work well {{if and only if}} the atmosphere is nearly adiabatic. I find that for the magnetoconvection problem the <b>anelastic</b> approximation works well if the departure from adiabaticity is small (as expected) and determine where the approximation breaks down. When the magnetic field is large then the <b>anelastic</b> approximation produces results which are markedly different from the fully compressible results. I also investigate the effects of altering the boundary conditions from isothermal to isentropic and the effect of stratification on how some of the parameters scale with the Chandrasekhar number. The results for magnetic buoyancy are less straight-forward, with the accuracy of the approximation being determined by the growth rate of the instability. I argue that these results make it difficult to assess a priori whether the <b>anelastic</b> approximation will provide an accurate approximation to the fully compressible system for stably stratified problems. Thus, unlike the magnetoconvection problem, for magnetic buoyancy it is difficult to provide general rules as to when the <b>anelastic</b> approximation can be used. When the instability grows quickly or the magnetic field is large the results do not compare well with the fully compressible equations. I outline a method for a two-dimensional non-linear time-stepping computer program and explain some problems with current non-linear programs.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of {{the properties of the}} <b>anelastic</b> and subseismic approximations is presented. The <b>anelastic</b> approximation is commonly used in astrophysics in compressible convection studies whereas the subseismic approximation comes from geophysics where it is used to describe long-period seismic oscillations propagating in the Earth's outer fluid core. Both approximations aim at filtering out the acoutic waves while retaining the density variations of the equilibrium configuration. However, they disagree on the form of the equation of mass conservation. We show here that the <b>anelastic</b> approximation is in fact the only consistent approximation as far as stellar low-frequency oscillations are concerned. We also show that this approximation implies Cowling's approximation which neglects perturbations of the gravity field.

40|$|The {{validity}} of the <b>anelastic</b> approximation has recently been questioned in the regime of rapidly-rotating compressible convection in low Prandtl number fluids (Calkins et al. 2015). Given the broad usage and the high computational efficiency of sound-proof approaches in this astrophysically relevant regime, this paper clarifies the conditions for a safe application. The potential of the alternative pseudo-incompressible approximation is investigated, {{which in contrast to}} the <b>anelastic</b> approximation is shown to never break down for predicting the point of marginal stability. Its accuracy, however, decreases close to the parameters corresponding to the failure of the <b>anelastic</b> approach, which is shown to occur when the sound-crossing time of the domain exceeds a rotation time scale, i. e. for rotational Mach numbers greater than one. Concerning the supercritical case, which is naturally characterised by smaller rotational Mach numbers, we find that the <b>anelastic</b> approximation does not show unphysical behaviour. Growth rates computed with the linearised <b>anelastic</b> equations converge toward the corresponding fully compressible values as the Rayleigh number increases. Likewise, our fully nonlinear turbulent simulations, produced with our fully compressible and <b>anelastic</b> models and carried out in a highly supercritical, rotating, compressible, low Prandtl number regime show good agreement.
