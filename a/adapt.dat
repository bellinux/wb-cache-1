Modifications were made to <b>adapt</b> to the new drive units and deal with the altered resonance pattern, and the LS3/5 became the LS3/5A.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Bakshi reread J. D.

Salinger had rejected previous offers to <b>adapt</b> the novel, and had not made a public appearance since 1965 or granted an interview since 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining why he should be allowed to <b>adapt</b> the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.|$|E

40|$|An afterimage's shape changes {{systematically}} {{depending on}} the <b>adapted</b> shape. <b>Adapting</b> to circles produces polygonal afterimages, whereas <b>adapting</b> to hexagons sometimes produce circular afterimages. In this study, a right-eye afterimage produced by <b>adapting</b> to circles was tested while the left eye <b>adapted</b> to a plain background, static circles, rotating circles, rotating stars, or rotating hexagons. Subjects rated the subjective roundness of the right-eye afterimage. Although the right eye <b>adapted</b> to circles, the ratings varied with the left-eye adaptation. After the left eye <b>adapted</b> to rotating hexagons, the right-eye afterimages were rated highest (most circular). In contrast, after the left eye <b>adapted</b> to rotating circles, the right-eye afterimages were rated lowest (most angular). This interocular transfer of shape adaptation demonstrates that afterimage shape is determined in a cortical area that collects information from both eyes...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} S-cone discrimination using a test annulus {{surrounded by an}} inner and outer <b>adapting</b> field with systematic manipulation of the <b>adapting</b> l L∕LM or s S∕LM chromaticities. The results showed that different <b>adapting</b> l chromaticities altered S-cone discrimination for a high <b>adapting</b> s chromaticity due to parvocellular input to the koniocellular pathway. In addition, S-cone discrimination {{was determined by the}} combined spectral signals arising from both <b>adapting</b> fields. The “white ” <b>adapting</b> field or an <b>adapting</b> field with a different l chromaticity from the other fields wasmore likely to have a stronger influence on discrimination thresh-olds. These results indicated that the two cardinal axes are not independent in S-cone discrimination, and the two <b>adapting</b> fields jointly contribute to S-cone discrimination through a cortical summation mechanism. © 201...|$|R
