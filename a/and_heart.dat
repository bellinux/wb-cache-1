5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E

5|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} Chagas disease {{are due to}} cell death in the target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle, by sequentially inducing an inflammatory response, cellular lesions, and fibrosis. For example, intracellular amastigotes destroy the intramural neurons of the autonomic nervous system in the intestine <b>and</b> <b>heart,</b> leading to megaintestine <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> aneurysms, respectively. If left untreated, Chagas disease can be fatal, in most cases due to heart muscle damage.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 Welsh health survey, {{conducted}} by the Welsh Assembly, reported that 51% of adults reported their health good or excellent, while 21% described their health as fair or poor. The survey also recorded that 27% of Welsh adults had a long-term chronic illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> disease. Enquiries into health-related lifestyle choices report 27% {{of the adult population}} are smokers, 45% admit drinking alcohol above recommended guidelines at least once a week, while 29% undertake the recommended weekly physical activity.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} on bond, Jernigan {{returned}} to {{the room at the}} Continental Inn in Lexington where he had been living prior to his arrest. On July 18, 1984, Jernigan's son Randy found him dead in the room. An autopsy showed that Jernigan suffered from coronary atherosclerosis, <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> disease was officially listed as the cause of death. Lexington police determined that there was no evidence to suggest foul play. Jernigan's ex-wife continued to pursue Jernigan's case against Wilkinson, but a Fayette County Circuit Court Judge awarded Wilkinson a summary judgment to dismiss the case in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Around 1934, {{he began}} working as a {{lecturer}} in economics at the City of London College. Upon his retirement from the university in 1958, Aaronson was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1959 New Year Honours, in recognition of more than twenty-five years of service. The same year he moved with his family from London to Harpenden in Hertfordshire, where he later died from coronary heart disease <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> failure on 9 December 1966, {{at the age of}} 71.

The BBC national stations and DAB coverage is enhanced by a small relay just south of the town centre.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is {{considered}} moderately dangerous in overdose. For significant overdoses, seizures {{have been reported}} in about a third of all cases; other serious effects include hallucinations, loss of consciousness, and abnormal heart rhythms. When bupropion was one of several kinds of pills taken in an overdose, fever, muscle rigidity, muscle damage, hypertension or hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported. While most people recover, some people have died, and before they died suffered multiple uncontrolled seizures <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> attacks.|$|E

5|$|Bupropion, {{when used}} for {{treating}} obesity {{over a period}} of 6 to 12 months, may result in weight loss of 2.7kg over placebo. This is not much different from the weight loss produced by several other medications, such as sibutramine or orlistat. It has been studied in combination with naltrexone. Concerns from bupropion include an increase in blood pressure <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> rate. In September 2014, a combination (bupropion/naltrexone) was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of obesity.|$|E
5|$|Cariappa's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} in 1991; {{he suffered from}} arthritis <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> problems.

5|$|Diagnosis of a {{pneumothorax}} {{by physical}} examination alone {{can be difficult}} (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. Other conditions that can result in similar symptoms include a hemothorax (buildup {{of blood in the}} pleural space), pulmonary embolism, <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> attack. A large bullae may look similar on a chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Domestic sheep are {{sometimes}} used in medical research, particularly for researching cardiovascular physiology, {{in areas such}} as hypertension <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> failure. Pregnant sheep are also a useful model for human pregnancy, and have been used to investigate the effects on fetal development of malnutrition and hypoxia. In behavioral sciences, sheep have been used in isolated cases for the study of facial recognition, as their mental process of recognition is qualitatively similar to humans.|$|E
5|$|Economically, {{the area}} depends on agriculture. Maize, rice, yuca, cotton <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> of palm are {{produced}} and exported. Cattle ranching {{and the industrial}} processing of milk and cheese have been developed extensively in recent years. Crafts, often carved of wood using the same techniques as in colonial times, provide additional income. Since {{the launch of the}} Jesuit Mission Circuit– a marketing label to promote regional tourism– in 2005, craftsmanship and tourism have been closely related.|$|E
