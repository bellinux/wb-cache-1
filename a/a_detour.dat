5|$|The scenery is {{now less}} wild, the cliffs less high. Rumps Point has Iron Age defences across its narrow neck but the path heads {{straight}} past to Pentire Head then swings eastwards again into Polzeath.

5|$|At the {{direction}} of Starfleet, Enterprise makes <b>a</b> <b>detour</b> to a planet passing between two gas giants, in order to observe the gravitational forces and subsequent volcanic activity. Their new course takes the ship close to that of E.C.S. Horizon, the cargo vessel where Ensign Mayweather grew up. He then requests permission for a further detour to re-join his family on Horizon as his father is ill and he hasn't been able to visit him in four years. Captain Archer readily agrees, but bad news arrives when Mayweather learns that his father died some six weeks earlier.|$|E
5|$|Discovery left Isle of Wight on 6 August 1901, {{and arrived}} in New Zealand via Cape Town on 29 November after <b>a</b> <b>detour</b> below 40°S for a {{magnetic}} survey. Quail Island in Lyttelton Harbour {{was used as}} the quarantine station for the expedition's dogs. After three weeks of final preparation she was ready for the journey south. On 21 December, as the ship was leaving Lyttelton to the cheers of large crowds, a young able seaman, Charles Bonner, fell to his death {{from the top of the}} mainmast, which he had climbed so as to return the crowd's applause. He was buried at Port Chalmers, two days later.|$|E

5|$|In Queensland, P. fimbriata is {{reluctant}} {{to jump into the}} webs of prey spiders, while other Portia species do this at any opportunity. The Queensland orb web spider Argiope appensa shakes its web violently to shake off intruders, and P. fimbriata finds <b>a</b> <b>detour</b> that allows it to abseil on to the prey. When the web spider Zosis genicularis is busy wrapping up its own prey and is less aware of other predators, P. fimbriata uses this activity as a type of smokescreen to approach the web spider.|$|E
5|$|In late July 1861, Lowe {{inflated}} {{a balloon}} in Washington with hopes of providing aerial {{coverage for the}} impending Battle of Bull Run, but a violent storm buffeted the inflated balloon and delayed Lowe until word of the Union defeat reached him on the road. Lowe subsequently decided to make <b>a</b> <b>detour</b> to Fort Corcoran, reaching it on July 27. Over the next few days, he repeatedly ascended in the balloon {{in order to make}} maps of the surrounding area and gather intelligence about Confederate troops advancing on Washington.|$|E
5|$|Later that day, Lt. Milton R. Rubb and his {{electronics}} technician team {{returned the}} fathometer to operational status, and the Chief Engineer Donald D. Fears, Reactor Officer Lt. Cmdr. Robert P. McDonald, and Tritons engineering crew repaired the malfunctioning reactor. Since Poole's symptoms were intermittent, Triton continued south, {{although there was}} <b>a</b> <b>detour</b> to the Golfo Nuevo region when the ship investigated an unknown sonar contact. Contemporary news accounts reported the Argentine Navy had been encountering numerous unknown submarine contacts in the Golfo Nuevo during early 1960, but Tritons contact {{turned out to be}} a school of fish.|$|E

5|$|One last raid {{was carried}} out on the 14 June—the day Paris fell—and the {{squadron}} abandoned France as Allied resistance crumbled. They landed at Houssay airfield. They then took off for RAF Driffield in Yorkshire. As they crossed over England MacLachlan took <b>a</b> <b>detour</b> to do a low fly-past over his old school at Monkton Combe near Bath. The stunt was witnessed by his brother who was attending the institution at the time. 88 Squadron relocated to Belfast, Northern Ireland on 23 June for rest and refitting. Following intensive operations during the Battle of France MacLachlan was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) (gazetted 16 July 1940).|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Donna {{accepts the}} Doctor's {{original}} offer to travel in the TARDIS. The Doctor makes it clear to her that he only wants to be friends and nothing more, and she emphatically agrees. She makes <b>a</b> <b>detour</b> to leave her car keys in a litter bin, telling her mother Sylvia to collect them later. While there, she meets a blonde woman and asks her to help Sylvia find the keys. The woman turns out to be Rose Tyler, who fades from view as she walks away from the area. In the final scene, Donna asks the Doctor to fly by her grandfather, Wilfred. He sees her in his telescope and celebrates on his allotment.|$|E
5|$|Dumbledore picks Harry up {{from his}} aunt and uncle's house, {{intending}} to escort him to the Burrow, home of Harry's best friend Ron. On the way, they make <b>a</b> <b>detour</b> to the temporary home of Horace Slughorn, former Potions teacher at Hogwarts, and Harry unwittingly helps persuade Slughorn to return to teach. Harry and Dumbledore then proceed to the Burrow, where Hermione has already arrived. The next morning, Harry, Ron, and Hermione get their Ordinary Wizarding Level (O.W.L.) results, along with lists of school supplies. Later, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger follow Draco to Dark Arts supplier Borgin and Burkes. Harry is instantly suspicious of Draco, whom he believes to be a Death Eater.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 1941, Galland {{took off}} with lobster and {{champagne}} to celebrate General Theo Osterkamp's birthday at Le Touquet, France. He made <b>a</b> <b>detour</b> with his wingman towards England, looking for RAF aircraft. Off the cliffs of Dover, he spotted a group of Spitfires. Galland attacked and claimed two confirmed and one unconfirmed shot down. The actual result was the destruction of one Spitfire; {{the other two were}} damaged in force landings with both pilots wounded. During the combat, Galland's undercarriage had dropped causing one of the RAF pilots (Flight Lieutenant Paddy Finucane) to claim Galland's aircraft as destroyed, but Galland landed without incident at Le Touquet and presented Osterkamp with his gifts. Galland's success that day represented his 60th and 61st aerial victory.|$|E

5|$|Progression through Shadow of the Colossus {{occurs in}} cycles. Beginning at a central point in an {{expansive}} landscape, the player seeks out and defeats a colossus, and is {{then returned to}} the central point to repeat the process. To find each colossus, Wander may raise his sword while in a sunlit area to reflect beams of light, which will converge when the sword is pointed in the right direction of the next encounter. The journey to a colossus is seldom a straightforward matter: stretches of varied terrain often require that <b>a</b> <b>detour</b> be taken along the way. Most colossi are located in remote areas, such as atop cliffs or within ancient structures.|$|E
5|$|The news of Selena's death deeply {{affected}} the Latino community; many people traveled {{thousands of miles}} to visit Selena's house, boutiques, and the crime scene. By mid-afternoon, police were asked to form <b>a</b> <b>detour</b> as a line of automobiles began backing up traffic from the Quintanillas' house. On the street where Selena had lived, gang graffiti and cacti distinguished the blue-collar community from other subdivisions across America. A chain-link fence in front of Selena's house became a shrine festooned with mementos as fans from across America left messages to Selena and the Quintanilla family. Most car drivers in Corpus Christi, and those driving cars on Interstate 37 from Mexico, turned their headlights on in her memory. Fans scribbled notes and messages, and placed them {{on the door and}} doorstep of the room in which Selena had been shot.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make <b>a</b> <b>detour</b> to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a distributed multihop range-free localization algorithm {{to mitigate the}} effects of network anisotropy with {{a small number of}} anchors. <b>A</b> <b>detoured</b> path detection method is presented to detect whether or not the shortest path between nodes is detoured by measuring the path deviation between the direct and shortest paths of a node pair. A distance estimation is proposed to estimate the distance between nodes with their approximate shortest path based on the path deviation. With the approximate shortest path, the proposed algorithm enables each normal node to measure how much the shortest path to <b>an</b> anchor is <b>detoured</b> from the direct path and to estimate the distance more accurately.|$|R
