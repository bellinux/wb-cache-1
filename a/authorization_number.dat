5000|$|Part B of IDEA {{originally}} authorized Congress {{to contribute}} up to 40 {{percent of the}} national average per pupil expenditure for each special education student. 20 U.S.C. § 1411(a). Appropriations for special education have failed to implement that original <b>authorization.</b> A <b>number</b> of studies have sought to track the apparent disparity between the federal commitment to special education and the shortfall in funding. A 2003 study by SEEP, now the Center for Special Education Finance, determined that the per pupil expenditures for special education range from a low of $10,558 for students with specific learning disabilities to a high of $20,095 for students with multiple disabilities. [...] According to the SEEP study, expenditures for students with specific learning disabilities were 1.6 times the expenditure for a regular education student, whereas expenditures for students with multiple disabilities were 3.1 times higher. Most states, in turn, have failed to make up the gap in federal funding, and this in turn has created financial pressures on local school districts. This has led to periodic calls for bringing appropriations in line with the original authorization.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{quality and}} {{quantity}} of published research papers are important in both scientific and technology fields. Although there are several bibliometric studies based on citation analysis, very few have focused on research related to Traditional Chinese Medicine in China. MethodsThe bibliometric method used in this study included the following focuses: publication outputs for each year, paper type, language of publication, distribution of internationally collaborative countries, sources of funding, <b>authorization</b> <b>number,</b> distribution of institutes regarding collaborative publications, research fields, distribution of outputs in journals, citation data, and h-index. ResultsA total of 3809 papers published from 1995 to 2012 were extracted from the science citation index (SCI). The cumulative number of papers from all six universities is constantly increasing. The United States attained the dominant position regarding complementary and alternative medicine research. The Chinese Academy of Sciences was the greatest participator in collaborative efforts. Research field analysis showed that the research mainly focused on pharmacology pharmacy, chemistry, integrative complementary medicine, plant sciences, and biochemistry molecular biology. The Shanghai University of Chinese Medicine had the most citations.

40|$|This Article critiques the {{practice}} of limiting federal agency authority {{in the name of}} federalism. Existing limits bind agencies even more tightly than Congress. For instance, although Congress can regulate to the limits of its commerce power with a sufficiently clear statement of its intent to do so, absent clear congressional authorization an agency cannot, no matter how clear the language of the agency 2 ̆ 7 s regulation. Similarly, although Congress can preempt state law, albeit only when its intent to do so is clear, some commentators have read it line of Supreme Court decisions to hold that agencies cannot, except upon Congress 2 ̆ 7 s clear <b>authorization.</b> A <b>number</b> of leading commentators have hailed this combination of rules on the ground that congressional control over questions of federalism should be preferred to agency decisionmaking. Congress, they claim, is more deliberative, more transparent to the public, and more accountable than the executive. Additionally, given the relative ease of enacting regulations rather than statutes, those who favor Congress fear that lower barriers to federal expansion in the executive would lead to runaway federal power. We argue that both these sets of claims are, at best, only occasionally accurate. In many instances agencies are-or with wise doctrines of judicial review can be made to be-more democratic and deliberative than Congress. Although regulating almost always is easier than legislating, in many instances the need for additional speed bumps tinder the wheels of the executive is negligible or downright counterproductive. Thus, we argue for a more nuanced set of rules that would permit agencies in many instances to preempt or regulate without the need for express congressional approval...|$|R
