5|$|Belgrano {{tried to}} promote the {{diversification}} of agriculture via the production of linen and hemp, following experiences with his friend Martín de Altolaguirre. He proposed to keep reserves of wheat to help have control over its price. He also tried to make leather recognised as <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, {{in order to promote}} its commercial potential. None of these proposals were accepted. He designed a system to give prizes to achievements that would boost the local economy, diversify the agriculture, or deforest the pampas. The system did not work as expected, and as nobody met the requirements no such prize was ever given.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Be and atomic number 4. It {{is a relatively}} rare element in the universe, usually occurring as <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars beryllium is depleted as it is fused and creates larger elements. It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only {{in combination with other}} elements in minerals. Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald) and chrysoberyl. As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham is chiefly <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18th, 19th and 20th centuries; {{its growth}} began during the Industrial Revolution. Consequently, {{relatively}} few buildings survive from its earlier history {{and those that}} do are protected. There are 1,946 listed buildings in Birmingham and thirteen scheduled ancient monuments. Birmingham City Council also operate a locally listing scheme for buildings that do not fully meet the criteria for statutorily listed status.|$|E
5|$|Both commanders were <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{environment}} of European warfare, which generally {{took place in}} open fields with relatively easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare. Neither liked the irregular warfare practiced by the Indians and British counterparts like Rogers' Rangers, but saw them as a necessary evil, given the operating environment. Although the French depended on Indian support to increase their comparatively small numbers throughout the war, Indian forces were quite low in this battle, and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices.|$|E

5|$|Briskin {{was born}} on February 8, 1896 in either Riga, Russia or New York City. His Parents were Benjamin and Rose Briskin. Two of his brothers, Irving and Murray also became film producers, while his sister, Ida, married a film studio executive. Briskin also had one other brother, Barnett (Barney), who {{was also in the}} film {{industry}} as a theater manager and in sales capacities. While some sources have his birthplace is Riga, Russia, others indicate that he was born in New York, after his parents immigrated there. Briskin was <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public school system. He obtained his college degree in accounting from the College of the City of New York.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, most glacial {{acetic acid}} was {{obtained}} from the pyroligneous liquor, <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distillation of wood. The acetic acid was isolated by treatment with milk of lime, and the resulting calcium acetate was then acidified with sulfuric acid to recover acetic acid. At that time, Germany was producing 10,000 tons of {{glacial acetic acid}}, around 30% of which was used for the manufacture of indigo dye.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert started {{developing}} {{what came to}} be known as the Society of Mind theory which views biological brain as massively parallel computer. In 1986, Minsky published The Society of Mind, which claims that “mind is formed from many little agents, each mindless by itself”. The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interaction of non-intelligent parts. Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and a computer to build with children's blocks.|$|E

5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there is a fantastic {{occurrence}} constitute a change in point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events from the perspective of the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E
5|$|Muscazone {{is another}} {{compound}} {{that has more}} recently been isolated from European specimens of the fly agaric. It is <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breakdown of ibotenic acid by ultra-violet radiation. Muscazone is of minor pharmacological activity compared with the other agents. Amanita muscaria and related species are known as effective bioaccumulators of vanadium; some species concentrate vanadium to levels of up to 400 times those typically found in plants. Vanadium is present in fruit-bodies as an organometallic compound called amavadine. The biological importance of the accumulation process is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Nepotism is {{a common}} feature {{in the history of}} governance, {{particularly}} in cultures where identity and loyalty are determined more {{at the level of the}} family than that of the nation-state.

5|$|The Assembly was <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Reformed tradition, taking as a {{major source}} the Thirty-Nine Articles {{as well as the}} {{theology}} of James Ussher and his Irish Articles of 1615. The divines also considered themselves to be within the broader European Reformed tradition. They were in frequent correspondence with continental Reformed theologians, and sought their approval. They also drew upon the pre-Reformation British theological tradition, which emphasized biblical knowledge and was influenced by the Augustinian theological tradition exemplified by Anselm, Thomas Bradwardine, and John Wycliffe. The recorded debates of the Assembly are full of citations of church fathers and medieval scholastic theologians.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Sengoku {{period from}} the mid-15th to early 17th century {{was a time}} of nearly continual {{military}} conflict. Powerful military lords known as daimyo, such as Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi or Tokugawa Ieyasu, struggled to unify Japan. During the Sengoku period, because of constant warfare, a large number of fortifications and castles were built. Archetypal Japanese castle construction is <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Momoyama period and early Edo period.|$|E

5|$|The large Goodyear fan-belt factory at Silverwood Industrial Estate was <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Craigavon {{development}} when {{large tracts}} of land in Lurgan, Portadown, and areas in between were zoned off for exclusive industrial use. The Goodyear factory closed in 1983 after failing to make a profit, resulting {{in the loss of}} 750 jobs. The facility was later partly occupied by Wilson Double Deck Trailers and DDL Electronics. Silverwood Industrial Estate continues to host other manufacturing and light engineering firms. Other industrial areas in the town are Annesborough and Halfpenny Valley (Portadown Road) industrial estates; areas in which growth has been limited compared to other industrial estates in the Craigavon Borough.|$|E
5|$|The {{still largely}} unexplained tectonic {{causes of the}} {{volcanism}} that has produced the Silverthrone Caldera are a matter of ongoing research. Silverthrone is not above a hotspot as are Nazko or Hawaii. However, it may be <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cascadia subduction zone because andesite, basaltic andesite, dacite and rhyolite {{can be found at}} the volcano and elsewhere along the subduction zone. At issue are the current plate configuration and rate of subduction but Silverthrone's chemistry indicates that Silverthrone is subduction related.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Newcastle United youth system, {{he spent}} six years at the club without {{managing}} to secure a regular first team place, instead spending time on loan at Watford, Nottingham Forest, and Barnsley. He was sold to Cardiff City for £500,000 in June 2006, and won {{a place on the}} PFA Team of the Year for his performances in the 2006–07 season. He then made a £5 million move to Premier League side Sunderland in July 2007, before returning to Cardiff on a loan deal that was made permanent in July 2009 for £3 million. He again was included in the PFA Team of the Year for the 2009–10 campaign, before being sold on to Ipswich Town for £1 million in June 2011. He joined Blackpool on a free transfer in July 2013, before moving to the Indian Super League with Kerala Blasters for the inaugural 2014 season.
