5|$|Blackcaps {{are caught}} by Eurasian sparrowhawks in the {{breeding}} range, and by Eleonora's falcons on migration. Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies take eggs and young, as do mammals such as stoats, weasels and squirrels. Domestic cats {{are the most}} important predator, possibly killing up to 10% of blackcaps. Blackcaps are occasionally hosts of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The level of parasitism is low because the cuckoo's eggs are often rejected. Blackcaps have evolved adaptations which make it difficult for the parasitic species to succeed, despite the cuckoo's tendency to lay eggs which resemble those of their host. Blackcaps <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> spotting alien eggs, and their own eggs are very alike within a clutch, making it easier to spot the intruder. There is, however, considerable variation between different clutches, making it harder for the cuckoo to convincingly mimic a blackcap egg. The open habitat and cup nest of the warbler make it a potential target for the cuckoo; it may have experienced much higher levels of parasitism in the past, and countermeasures would have spread rapidly once they evolved.|$|E

Icelandic women <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> football, the national team being ranked eighteenth by FIFA.|$|E
25|$|Crayfish are {{commonly}} sold {{and used as}} bait, either live or with only the tail meat, and <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> attracting channel catfish, walleye, trout, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, pike and muskellunge. Sometimes the claws are removed so that the crayfish do not stop fish from biting the hook. Crayfish easily fall off the hook, so casting should be slow.|$|E

Alternative 6 is between criteria 2 and 3; therefore, it <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> both criteria. Alternative 5 is between criteria 1 and 3; therefore, it <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> both criteria. But seen in Figure 1, alternative 5 is closer to Pi than others. Therefore, {{it should be the}} best compromise solution.|$|R

25|$|An area of top {{scientific}} {{interest for}} Curiosity {{lies at the}} edge of the landing ellipse and beyond a dark dune field. Here, orbiting instruments have detected signatures of both clay minerals and sulfate salts. Scientists studying Mars have several hypotheses about how these minerals reflect changes in the Martian environment, particularly changes in the amount of water on the surface of Mars. The rover will use its full instrument suite to study these minerals and how they formed. Certain minerals, including the clay and sulfate-rich layers near the bottom of Gale's mountain, <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> latching onto organic compounds—potential biosignatures—and protecting them from oxidation.|$|E
25|$|There are two centres in a rugby team, inside centre (number 12) {{and outside}} centre (number 13). The inside centre usually stands {{close to the}} fly-half or at first {{receiver}} {{on the other side}} of the scrum or breakdown. Like the fly-half, they generally possess a good kicking game and <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> reading the play and directing the attack. The outside centre is positioned outside the inside centre and is generally the faster of the two. The centres' main role is to provide space for the players outside them. They need to run good lines (run into spaces or at 90 degrees to their opposition), be able to side step and swerve, and have good passing skills. When the ball is moved along the opposition backline, the centres are the first players to make the tackle. They need to be aggressive tacklers to knock their opponent down and seize the ball and be good at organising the defensive lines. Outside centres generally have more room to move than inside centres. Centres also provide support at the breakdowns and can run as decoys to confuse the defence.|$|E
500|$|Yet {{another option}} is to create the UNPA as a nongovernmental {{organization}} of democratically elected legislators. This would have the advantage of not requiring the cooperation of (sometimes dictatorial) national governments or world parliamentary organizations with dictatorial members, so only democratic legislators, parliaments and countries would be represented. The World Constitution and Parliament Association and other NGOs have attempted to set up workable parliaments. Dieter Heinrich critiqued this approach by saying, [...] "If it did succeed on any scale, it would divert resources from pressuring governments on thousands of specific issues, which citizens <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>at,</b> into the operation of a pan-global institutional structure, which citizens' groups are ill equipped to do...And the resulting assembly would always be of doubtful legitimacy (who does it really represent?) and of unlikely value as an evolutionary starting point for a real world parliament." ...|$|E

500|$|Cooder's displeasure {{with the}} Republican Party and its {{financial}} supporters, particularly the Koch Brothers, also inspired his songwriting. He found {{the party to}} be [...] "insanely dangerous" [...] to Barack Obama's presidency and the US, and said of them in an interview for The Guardian, [...] "in case anybody thinks Michele Bachmann or Sarah Palin are clowns because they misspeak or don't know their history or they say silly things: that's just an act, and it's a useful act. Everything is a distraction from the core truths which are, first of all, that corporations have taken over the country." [...] He viewed that his songs for the album provide a more convenient alternative for citizens who do not research politicians, saying that [...] "I don't write books and give speeches but with a four-minute song you can use allegory and other means to suggest {{a different point of}} view. It's like looking around the corner, and that's what songs <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> sometimes. They hit you with a new thought – assuming that people will listen." ...|$|E
500|$|The two French sailors {{that reached}} Leander {{immediately}} began a systematic pillaging of the British officers' personal effects. Rather than tossing the men into the sea, as historian William James suggests {{they should have}} done, Thompson instead ordered one of the British boats to be repaired and launched to transport him to the French ship and bring back Captain Lejoille {{in the belief that}} he would end the looting. However, when the French captain arrived he immediately joined his officers, commandeering all but two of Captain Thompson's shirts and the wounded officer's cot. When Captain Berry complained that a pair of ornamental pistols had been stolen from him, Lejoille summoned the thief to the quarterdeck and took them for himself. The sailors who accompanied Lejoille were equally voracious: among the many things taken were the ship surgeon Mr Mulberry's operating tools, stolen {{in the middle of an}} operation. Without the correct equipment, the surgeon could not assist the many wounded, including Captain Thompson, who had a musket ball still embedded deeply in his arm. When Captain Berry complained, Lejoille replied [...] "J'en suis fâché, mais le fait est, que les Français sont bons au pillage" [...] ("I'm sorry, but the fact is, that the French <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> plunder").|$|E
500|$|The EA Partners {{game was}} later officially {{revealed}} at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011 as Overstrike. This game was pitched by Ratchet & Clank director Brian Allgeier {{and it has}} a direction {{similar to that of the}} Ratchet & Clank series. The team thought Overstrike would appeal to teenagers. After several play-testing sessions, they realized their game was too simple for teenagers. The company developed many weapons for the game, none of which related to the game's story. The developers retooled the game and changed it to attract older players and make weapons an important part of the game. The game focuses on a co-operative campaign, which the company thought was a popular trend at that time. It was later renamed Fuse and was released worldwide on May 2013. Fuse was one of the lowest-rated games developed by Insomniac, and was another commercial failure, debuting in 37th place in UK in its first week of release. Fuse was considered a learning lesson for Insomniac to understand the type of game they <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> making. The reception to Fuse showed the company it should develop [...] "colorful, playful experience that's loaded with unusual, sometimes silly weapons". Also in 2013, the last Ratchet & Clank Future game, , was released.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began on}} March 12, 2007, {{with the first}} few weeks spent on Stark's captivity in Afghanistan. The cave where Stark is imprisoned was a [...] long set, which had movable forks in the caverns to allow greater freedom for the film's crew. Production {{designer}} J. Michael Riva saw footage of a Taliban fighter in Afghanistan, and saw the cold breath as he spoke: realizing remote caves are actually very cold, Riva placed an air conditioning system in the set. He also sought Downey's advice about makeshift objects in prison, such as a sock being used to make tea. Afterwards, Stark's capture was filmed at Lone Pine, and other exterior scenes in Afghanistan were filmed at Olancha Sand Dunes, where the crew endured two days of [...] winds. Filming at Edwards Air Force Base began in mid-April, and ended on May 2. Exterior shots of Stark's home were digitally added to footage of Point Dume in Malibu, while the interior was built at Playa Vista, where Favreau and Riva aimed to make Stark's home look less futuristic and more [...] "". Filming concluded on June 25, 2007, at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. Favreau, a newcomer to action films, remarked, [...] "I'm shocked that I [...] on schedule. I thought that there were going to be many curveballs". He hired [...] "people who <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> creating action", so [...] "the human story [...] like it belongs to the comic book genre".|$|E
2500|$|With Eritrea's {{refusal to}} accept the US/Rwanda peace plan, on 22 February 1999 Ethiopia {{launched}} a massive military offensive to recapture Badme. Tension had been high since 6 February 1999, when Ethiopia claimed that Eritrea had violated the moratorium on air raids by bombing Adigrat, a claim it later withdrew. Surveying the extensive trenches the Eritreans had constructed, Ethiopian General Samora Yunis observed, [...] "The Eritreans <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> digging trenches and we <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> converting trenches into graves.

The ability to apply this adhesive in similar quantities and thicknesses is difficult to measure in quantitative terms. This decreases reproducibility. If epoxy is used, properties and specifications of that epoxy must be checked. Epoxy functions within a wide range of temperature tolerances.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{practical}} matter, passwords must be both reasonable and functional {{for the end}} user as well as strong enough for the intended purpose.

In contrast, others argue that forcing users to remember passwords without assistance can only accommodate weak passwords, and thus poses a greater security risk. According to Bruce Schneier, most people <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> securing their wallets or purses, which is a [...] "great place" [...] to store a written password.|$|E
2500|$|However, logistically, the Germans were {{starting}} to suffer serious problems in supplying their frontline just four weeks into the campaign. Richthofen lamented, [...] "the Germans <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> fighting but weak at logistics". While German production could make up for losses at the front, it took time to get aircraft to the sector. The common operating strength by late summer was 50 to 60 percent, including Fliegerkorps VIII. Between 19 July and 31 August, the Luftwaffe had lost 725 aircraft. Before the operations in the Soviet Union, scant attention {{had been made to}} logistical operations in the east, primarily because of German over-confidence.|$|E
2500|$|Full {{forwards}} <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> one-on-one contests {{with the}} opposition and are the main target in the forward line when attacking.
