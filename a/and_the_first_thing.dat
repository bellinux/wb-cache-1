25|$|David Wheeler, {{who earned}} the world's first Computer Science PhD {{working on the}} project, is {{credited}} with inventing {{the concept of a}} subroutine. Users wrote programs that called a routine by jumping {{to the start of the}} subroutine with the return address (i.e. the location-plus-one of the jump itself) in the accumulator (a Wheeler jump). By convention the subroutine expected this <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> it did was to modify its concluding jump instruction to that return address. Multiple and nested subroutines could be called so long as the user knew the length of each one in order to calculate the location to jump to; recursive calls were forbidden. The user then copied the code for the subroutine from a master tape onto their own tape following the end of their own program.|$|E
25|$|After Arthur {{has taken}} {{each of the}} seven keys, and the will becomes fulfilled, a huge wave of Nothing dissolves the Incomparable Gardens, Lord Sunday's domain, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> the Architect created. This causes the whole of {{creation}} to be destroyed with it including all of the secondary realms (including Earth). Arthur regains consciousness in the void of Nothing (as he holds the power of all seven keys, he is unable to be destroyed unless he so wishes), and he meets the Architect, who is revealed to be the Old One and the Will, once split into two parts to govern the house and the secondary realms respectively. When the Architect and the Old One fell out, the Architect chained the Old One eternally. Doing this meant that she could not return to Nothing when she wished, as she had to go as one. The only way to release the Old One was to destroy creation. These terms were laid out in the will.|$|E

It received 1,715 submissions from 77 countries, {{a record}} for a museum design competition. The design chosen for a proposed €130 million Guggenheim museum in Helsinki, Finland, envisions [...] "an indistinct jumble of pavilions faced in charred wood" [...] and glass. The winning design is by Paris-based Moreau Kusunoki Architectes. Critics objected to the dark color of the design's exterior, which contrasts with the surrounding architecture, {{as well as the}} shape of the building. Osku Pajamaki, vice chairman of the city’s executive board, said: [...] "The symbol of the lighthouse is arrogant {{in the middle of the}} historical center ... a Guggenheim museum next to Notre Dame in Paris. People are approaching from the sea, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that they will see is that the citizens of Helsinki bought their identity from the Guggenheim."

I was running the international operations under Abernethy and I was following Jeep around. When they put up a plant, I followed with a Rambler plant because it worked like a charm.
