The company expanded its product line, selling [...] "Selmer" [...] branded wind instruments and mouthpieces from manufacturers in the USA in <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> Selmer (Paris) clarinets. In 1923, the H&A Selmer Company was incorporated {{to expand into}} a distributing company with a retail chain and a 49% share sold to C. G. Conn Ltd. In 1927 Bundy gained full ownership, establishing independence of the company. H&A Selmer (USA) remained the sole importer of Selmer (Paris) products, including saxophones and brasswinds once exports of such instruments to the USA commenced. Selmer also went on to establish itself as a leading distributor of student-grade instruments under its Artley and Bundy brands. In 1939 Selmer financed the startup Artley Flute Company of Elkhart Indiana, which provided flutes, and later clarinets, exclusively to Selmer until 1953. In 1948 Selmer initiated the Selmer Artist promotional program for professional musicians, which offered special deals for musicians who agreed to perform and record exclusively with Selmer (Paris) instruments. The Selmer Artist program boosted the reputation of Selmer (Paris) among aspiring professionals, enhancing sales. In 1961 Selmer acquired the brasswind manufacturer Vincent Bach Corporation. Moving production from Bach's Mount Vernon, New York facility to Elkhart, Indiana in 1965, Selmer started in-house production of Bundy student-line brass instruments in <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> its <b>premium</b> line, Bach Stradivarius. In 1963 Selmer acquired ownership of its main supplier of student saxophones, the Buescher Band Instrument Company.

40|$|Foreign {{exchange}} market efficiency is commonly investigated by Fama-regression tests of uncovered interest parity (UIP). In this paper, we conjecture a speculative UIP relationship which implies that exchange rate changes comprise a time-varying risk component in <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> the forward <b>premium.</b> This {{suggests that the}} forward premium anomaly reported in previous research potentially stems from omitting this component in UIP tests and that the popular carry-trade strategy can be rationalized to some extent. Moreover, while related work focuses on the Fama-regression slope coefficient, we show that also the intercept is important for judging the economic significance of currency speculation. Empirically, we find support for speculative UIP {{and the existence of}} a risk-premium. Furthermore, although carry-traders are able to collect some risk-premia, currency speculation does not yield economically significant excess returns, which suggests that foreign {{exchange market}}s are speculatively efficient. Disregarding the Fama-regression constant, however, leads to distortions in the assessment of economic significance and induces spurious rejection of speculative efficiency.
