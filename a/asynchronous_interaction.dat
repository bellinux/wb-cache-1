5000|$|After {{operating}} {{a question in}} the described procedure, the participant can continue to the next question or press a “save”-button in the program, which leads to an immediate update of the median, interquartile range, and given arguments, and then leave the program. A second advantage of the round-less approach is the fact that, {{in order to take}} part in the study, participants can login and logout with their personalised account as often as they want during the time frame provided. Their already given answers will be saved and recalled when they login the next time. So, by design of the study, there are no explicit single rounds to answer the questions. Updating and playing back the information to the other participants follow immediately in succession to the process of answering. Here, it becomes clear that the process of answering can be synchronous or asynchronous and a worldwide expert panel can be reached, which is one of the major advantages of web-based tools. Turoff and Hiltz [...] argue that the issue of <b>asynchronous</b> <b>interaction</b> is probably one of the least understood characteristics of Real-Time Delphis. Zipfinger [...] points out two advantages of asynchronous participation of the experts: First, they can login to the portal whenever they want; therefore, one could argue that the degree of convenience of taking part is increased for the participant due to a 24h-availability of the portal. Second, panellists can contribute to whatever aspects in the questionnaire they want, especially when having gone through each question at least once. Here, a substantial aspect of Real-Time Delphis becomes obvious: Turoff and Hiltz [...] explain that a Real-Time Delphi study offers a design of structured communication which allows every individual to choose the sequence and speed to contribute to the problem solution process. So, in comparison to face-to-face discussions, the Real-Time Delphi approach gives room for individuality and different cognitive abilities of the participants.|$|E

We have developed a multimedia synchronization toolkit, called Nsync (pronounced 'in-sync'), to address the complicated issues inherent in designing flexible, interactive multimedia presentations. The toolkit consists of two major components, a declarative synchronization definition language and a run-time presentation management system. The synchronization definition language supports the specification of synchronous interaction, <b>asynchronous</b> <b>interaction,</b> and fine-grained relationships among multiple media objects. The language also supports the combination of interactive behavior and fine-grained relationships through the use of conjunctive and disjunctive operators.

This study focuses on a French national blended learning program (Pairform@nce) based on a collaborative training. More specifically, we tend to highlight modifications, additions and suppressions of resources as well as modifications of scenario and use of supports as indicators of appropriation.
