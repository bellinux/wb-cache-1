5|$|As well {{as being}} an astronomer, Gascoigne was a scholar {{of the history of}} Australian astronomy. He wrote {{histories}} of major telescopes, such as the Melbourne Telescope and the AAT. He wrote biographies for the Australian Dictionary of Biography, including those of the first trained <b>astronomer</b> <b>at</b> Canberra's Mount Stromlo Observatory, William Bolton Rimmer, and pioneering Australian astronomer Robert Ellery.|$|E
5|$|The mission's Principal Investigator was Michael A'Hearn, an <b>astronomer</b> <b>at</b> the University of Maryland.

5|$|James E. Rhoads, an <b>astronomer</b> <b>at</b> the Kitt Peak National Observatory, {{analyzed}} the burst {{and determined that}} it was not strongly beamed. Further analysis by Frail and his colleagues indicated that the total energy released by the burst was approximately 5×1050ergs (5×1043J), and Rhoads determined that the total gamma-ray energy was approximately 3×1050erg (3×1043J). This implied that the gamma-ray and kinetic energy of the burst's ejecta were comparable, effectively ruling out those GRB models which are relatively inefficient at producing gamma rays.|$|E

5|$|SETI {{researcher}} Carl Sagan {{believed that}} a civilization with the technological prowess needed to reach the stars and come to Earth must have transcended war {{to be able to}} avoid self-destruction. Representatives of such a civilization would treat humanity with dignity and respect, and humanity, with its relatively backward technology, would {{have no choice but to}} reciprocate. Seth Shostak, an <b>astronomer</b> <b>at</b> the SETI Institute, disagrees, stating that the finite quantity of resources in the galaxy would cultivate aggression in any intelligent species, and that an explorer civilization that would want to contact humanity would be aggressive. Similarly, Ragbir Bhathal claims that since the laws of evolution would be the same on another habitable planet as they are on Earth, an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization may have the motivation to colonize humanity, much as British colonizers did to the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E
25|$|Before emigrating to the United States, Nicollet was a {{professor}} of mathematics at Collège Louis-le-Grand, and {{a professor}} and <b>astronomer</b> <b>at</b> the Paris Observatory with Pierre-Simon Laplace.

25|$|The post of Her Majesty's <b>astronomer</b> <b>at</b> the Cape of Good Hope {{was awarded}} the Royal Medal on two occasions; the first to Thomas Maclear in 1869 for {{measurement}} of an arc of the meridian at the Cape of Good Hope and the second to David Gill in 1903 for researches in solar and stellar parallax, and his energetic direction of the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope.|$|E
25|$|Nicollet {{was born}} in the French Alpes city of Cluses, Savoy, France. He was very bright, showing {{aptitude}} in mathematics and astronomy that earned him a scholarship to the Jesuit college in Chambéry. He began teaching mathematics at age 19. In 1817, he was appointed as a professor and <b>astronomer</b> <b>at</b> the Paris Observatory and worked with scientist and mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace. While working at the observatory, Nicollet discovered a comet and built a reputation as an expert in astronomy and physical geography. During the 1820s, he worked as a mathematics professor at the Collège Louis-le-Grand.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, {{he left to}} join Professor Fred Whipple, the Harvard <b>astronomer,</b> <b>at</b> the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, {{which had}} {{combined}} with the Harvard Observatory at Harvard. Hynek had the assignment of directing the tracking of an American space satellite, a project for the International Geophysical Year in 1956 and thereafter. In addition to over 200 teams of amateur scientists {{around the world that}} were part of Operation Moonwatch, there were also 12 photographic Baker-Nunn stations. A special camera was devised for the task and a prototype was built and tested and then stripped apart again when, on Oct. 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched its first satellite, Sputnik 1.|$|E

500|$|The comet brightened rapidly, {{and within}} days {{had become an}} {{exceptionally}} bright object. Her Majesty's <b>Astronomer</b> <b>at</b> the Cape, David Gill, reported watching the comet rise {{a few minutes before}} the Sun on 18 September, and described it as [...] "The nucleus was then undoubtedly single, and certainly rather under than over 4″ in diameter; in fact, as I have described it, it resembled very much a star of the 1st magnitude seen by daylight.

500|$|In 1850 James Ferguson, Assistant <b>Astronomer</b> <b>at</b> the United States Naval Observatory, {{noted that}} he had [...] "lost" [...] a star he had observed, GR1719k, which Lt.

Subsequent searches failed to recover the [...] "planet" [...] in a different position, and in 1878, CHF Peters, director of the Hamilton College Observatory in New York, showed that the star had not in fact vanished, and that the previous results had been due to human error.|$|E

The observatory was established in 1945 by Sir Bernard Lovell, a radio <b>astronomer</b> <b>at</b> the University of Manchester who wanted to investigate cosmic rays after his work on radar during the Second World War. It has since {{played an important role in}} the research of meteors, quasars, pulsars, masers and gravitational lenses, and was heavily involved with the tracking of space probes at the start of the Space Age. The managing director of the observatory is Professor Simon Garrington.|$|E
500|$|The Nassau Station, {{originally}} {{constructed in}} the 1950s, currently houses a 36-inch reflecting telescope. It is named after observatory director Jason John Nassau, who was a prominent <b>astronomer</b> <b>at</b> the time. [...] Work {{was carried out in}} the 1990s to make the telescope capable of remote viewing, {{making it one of the}} first telescopes to be used in this manner. However, it was seldom used by Case astronomers due to increased light pollution from Cleveland and the enhanced capabilities of the Burrell Schmidt. As a result, the observatory was left unused for several years until 2008, when it was sold to the Geauga Park District. The park district reopened the facility as part of its Observatory Park on June 16, 2012. The park was designated as a dark sky park by the International Dark Sky Association.|$|E
