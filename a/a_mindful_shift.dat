The purpose of this hermeneutic phenomenological {{study was to explore}} the lived experiences of counselor educators with a daily mindfulness practice in the classroom with culturally diverse students. Relational-cultural theory (RCT) was the conceptual framework. Relational cultural theory concepts of relational connections and disconnections were used to explore the participants 2 ̆ 7 lived experiences implementing <b>a</b> <b>mindful</b> teaching approach. Purposeful sampling yielded 10 participants who participated in semi-structured interviews. Using an inductive approach, the data were analyzed to identify essential themes. Thematic analysis was conducted by hand using literature-based codes and lean coding. Findings extracted from the literature review were used to pinpoint level one themes. Lean codes, or emergent themes, were then placed under each literature-based theme. The literature-based themes included: mindfulness practices, contemplative practices and the experience of educators, mindfulness competencies, interconnectivity, treatment outcomes, therapeutic presence, relational empathy, awareness and acceptance, self-care, and critiques. The emergent subthemes included: <b>a</b> <b>mindful</b> attitude, evaluation, modeling for students, creativity in the classroom, mindful orthodoxy versus personal experiences, authenticity, and cultural awareness. Findings may be useful for counselor educators who seek a greater capacity for awareness, acceptance, empathy, self-care, creativity, and presence when working with diverse students in the classroom.

Study Aims: Aim 1 : To determine the effect of <b>a</b> <b>mindful</b> eating intervention compared to usual diet and exercise information on BMI of obese female adolescents. Aim 2 : To determine if the effect of <b>a</b> <b>mindful</b> eating intervention on BMI of obese female adolescents is sustained over time. Aim 3 : To determine the feasibility of conducting <b>a</b> group <b>mindful</b> eating intervention over six weeks for obese adolescent girls in their school setting. Methods: Obesity was measured by Body Mass Index (BMI) = Weight in Pounds / Height in inches x Height in inches x 703. The sample included adolescent females aged 14 - 17 years with BMI> 90 th%. Participants were randomized to an intervention group receiving <b>a</b> 6 week <b>mindful</b> eating intervention and a comparison group receiving the usual care of nutrition and physical activity handouts. Participants' BMI was measured at baseline, immediately post intervention and at 4 week follow up assessing intervention effectiveness. Results: ANOVA results demonstrate a statistically significant difference in BMI between the experimental and comparison groups F(1, 2) = 22. 24, p<. 001. On average, the experimental group's BMI decreased 0. 71, whereas the comparison group's BMI increased by 1. 1 over the 6 week intervention.

40|$|Background. The {{aim of this}} randomized, {{controlled}} {{study was}} to investigate the effectiveness of <b>a</b> <b>mindful</b> walking program in patients with high levels of perceived psychological distress. Methods. Participants aged between 18 and 65 years with moderate to high levels of perceived psychological distress were randomized to 8 sessions of mindful walking in 4 weeks (each 40 minutes walking, 10 minutes mindful walking, 10 minutes discussion) or to no study intervention (waiting group). Primary outcome parameter was the difference to baseline on Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS) after 4 weeks between intervention and control. Results. Seventy-four participants were randomized in the study; 36 (32 female, 52. 3 ± 8. 6 years) were allocated to the intervention and 38 (35 female, 49. 5 ± 8. 8 years) to the control group. Adjusted CPSS differences after 4 weeks were − 8. 8 [95 % CI: − 10. 8; − 6. 8] (mean 24. 2 [22. 2; 26. 2]) in the intervention group and − 1. 0 [− 2. 9; 0. 9] (mean 32. 0 [30. 1; 33. 9]) in the control group, resulting in a highly significant group difference ().

40|$|Background Excessive energy intake that {{contributes}} to overweight and obesity is arguably driven by pleasure associated with the rewarding properties of energy-dense palatable foods. It is important to address influences of external food cues in food-abundant societies where people make over 200 food related decisions each day. This study experimentally examines protective effects of <b>a</b> <b>mindful</b> attention induction on appetitive measures, state craving and food intake following exposure to energy-dense foods. Method Forty females were randomly allocated to a standard food-cue exposure condition in which attention is brought to the hedonic properties of food or food-cue exposure following <b>a</b> <b>mindful</b> attention induction. Appetitive reactions were measured pre, post and 10 min after post-cue exposure, after which a plate of cookies {{was used as a}} surreptitious means of measuring food intake. Results Self-reported hunger remained unchanged and fullness significantly increased for the mindful attention group post-cue exposure whereas hunger significantly increased for the standard attention group and fullness remained unchanged. There was no significant between-group difference in state craving post-cue exposure and 10 min later. Significantly more cookies were eaten by the standard attention group 10 min post-cue exposure although no significant between-group differences in appetitive and craving measures were reported at that time. Conclusion Our results point to a promising brief intervention strategy and highlights the importance of distinguishing mindful attention from attention. Results also demonstrate that mindful attention can influence food intake even when craving and hunger are experienced...|$|R
50|$|Another {{criteria}} the Buddha {{taught to}} differentiate Dhamma {{from what was}} not his teaching, was that of analyzing how a particular teaching affects one's thinking.

Hence in the Early Buddhist texts, the work of hermeneutics is deeply tied with the spiritual practice and <b>a</b> <b>mindful</b> awareness of the effect our practices have on our state of mind.|$|R
