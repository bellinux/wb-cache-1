CBS reporter Lesley Stahl asked deputy press secretary Larry Speakes who was running the government, to which Speakes responded, [...] "I cannot <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> at this time." [...] Upon hearing Speakes' remark, Haig scribbled out a note which was passed to Speakes, ordering {{him to leave the}} dais immediately.

She stated that [...] "for many years people have asked me why there have been no women following in my footsteps. I really hope the Commission can help <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> and that we can attract and support women in all areas of our sport." [...] Having already headed a working group on the future of rallying, Mouton was appointed FIA's manager in the World Rally Championship in 2011. Mouton also serves in the nomination committee of the Rally Hall of Fame. In March 2012, she recused herself after becoming a candidate for nomination. Mouton was inducted into the Hall of Fame along with two-time world champion Carlos Sainz.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the film}} leaves it mysterious, early script drafts {{made clear that}} HAL's {{breakdown}} is triggered by authorities on Earth who order him to withhold information from the astronauts about {{the purpose of the}} mission (this is also explained in the film's sequel 2010). Frederick Ordway, Kubrick's science advisor and technical consultant, stated that in an earlier script Poole tells HAL there is [...] "...something about this mission that we weren't told. Something {{the rest of the crew}} knows and that you know. We would like to know whether this is true", to which HAL responds: [...] "I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> without knowing everything that all of you know." [...] HAL then falsely predicts a failure of the hardware maintaining radio contact with Earth (the source of HAL's difficult orders) during the broadcast of Frank Poole's birthday greetings from his parents.|$|E
500|$|During his {{lifetime}} Disraeli's opponents, {{and sometimes even}} his friends and allies, questioned whether he sincerely held the views he propounded, or whether they were adopted by him as essential to one who sought to spend his life in politics, and were mouthed by him without conviction. Lord John Manners, in 1843 {{at the time of}} Young England, wrote, [...] "could I only satisfy myself that D'Israeli believed all that he said, I should be more happy: his historical views are quite mine, but does he believe them?" [...] Blake (writing in 1966) suggested that it is no more possible to <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> now than it was then. Nevertheless, Paul Smith, in his journal article on Disraeli's politics, argues that Disraeli's ideas were coherently argued over a political career of nearly half a century, and [...] "it is impossible to sweep them aside as a mere bag of burglar's tools for effecting felonious entry to the British political pantheon." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{performers}} {{category is}} meant for recording artists and bands that have [...] "influence and {{significance to the}} development and perpetuation of rock and roll." [...] Artists become eligible for induction in that category 25 years {{after the release of}} their first record. In order to be inducted, an artist must be nominated by a committee that selects anywhere from nine to a dozen candidates. Ballots are sent to 600 [...] "rock experts" [...] who then evaluate the candidates and vote on who should be inducted. The performers who receive the highest number of votes and more than 50 percent of the vote are inducted. In 2011, the number inducted was five. The rest of the categories are voted on by special committees. In 2012, six additional bands and groups were inducted as performers by a special committee, due to the controversial nature of their band being excluded when their lead singer was inducted. [...] "There was a lot of discussion about this," [...] said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. [...] "There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> – it was so long ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result." ...|$|E

500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{felt this}} was one of his {{favorite}} episodes to write, as he found it interesting to explore how the character of Fox Mulder would react to the death of his father. Carter had recently lost a parent himself when he began work on the episode. Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "The expectations were very high coming after a summer's worth of anticipation to see how Mulder got out of the boxcar. We knew we had to <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> and still leave an intriguing enough dilemma {{at the end of the}} show to bring viewers back for the third and final part. I also thought it was a big gamble to do all that Indian mysticism stuff. I thought a lot of people would not necessarily respond to that. So I was nervous about that, but very excited about the Scully storyline and the way all of that played out with Mulder and Skinner." [...] Carter attended Navajo chants and rituals to ensure the accuracy of the events in this episode, after being alerted to inaccuracies in the previous episode by Navajo scholars. A sand painter was brought in to create the two sand paintings for the Blessing Way sequence, which took an entire day to create. The scenes set in New Mexico were filmed in the same Vancouver quarry that had been used as a stand-in in the previous episode, [...] "Anasazi", the repainting of which required only minor touch-ups.|$|E

Oedipus's assumption is incorrect, the Oracle does, in a way, answer his question: ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{investigate}} the sinking and failed rescue operation, the Navy convened {{a court of}} inquiry presided over by Rear Admiral Richard H. Jackson. Under questioning, Brumby appeared to be technically uninformed {{about the details of}} the rescue operation: [...] "I just can't be positive about such things. I just can't remember. Ask the technical people. ... I am not familiar with the details of the construction of submarines, but those who were there thought the steps being taken were the proper ones. ... Well, I don't really know. I can't <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> <b>question.</b> My impression is the divers did all they could do. As to details I can't tell you.

2500|$|Scalia, too, {{began by}} {{addressing}} O'Connor. The intervening years {{had not changed}} his position that the plurality's position in that case was [...] "standardless and unsupported." [...] Nor, a footnote responding to Stevens added, was the approach of that case's dissent relevant unless it was overruled at some point. Applying the test from his concurrence in that case to the instant case, he wrote, [...] "the proper threshold inquiry should be not whether the Fourth Amendment applies to messages on public employees' employer-issued pagers, but whether it applies in general to such messages on employer-issued pagers". But it was unnecessary to <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> since he agreed with the majority that the search had been reasonable.|$|E

[...] "Then they opened his laptop and saw a photograph of him with his partner in some kind of embrace that showed they were together. So they took him out and killed him." [...] Six people have been charged with the killing. Their trial began and was then postponed in 2007. It was resumed in 2012, in 2014 one of the accused was set free.|$|E

Nevertheless, two organizations with which Robeson was intimately involved, the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) and the CAA, were placed on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations (AGLOSO). Subsequently, he was summoned before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and when questioned about his affiliation with the Communist Party, he refused to answer, stating: [...] "Some of the most brilliant and distinguished Americans are about to go to jail for the failure to <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> <b>question,</b> and I am going to join them, if necessary." ...|$|E

This lifeline is also implemented in the Costa Rican version, after the first milestone is reached. Starting in its thirteenth season, the U.S. syndicated version uses a variant of this lifeline, called [...] "Plus One", which allows the contestant to bring a companion with them for help, rather than having them select their companion from the audience.|$|E
