40|$|The authors {{demonstrate}} how purely <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>horizontal</b> mergers can produce larger gains for merging firms than for nonmerging firms. Moreover, these anticompetitive mergers do not promote entry. These findings, which eliminate a long-standing free-rider problem {{from the previous}} merger literature, stem from the ability of firms to price discriminate under asymmetric competition. To illustrate, the authors use a spatial model of consumer preferences. Their results suggest that merger may significantly reduce consumer surplus in markets with certain characteristics, such as those where bidding occurs. The authors' model also shows that price discrimination facilitates entry deterrence in spatial markets. ...|$|R

In contrast to horizontal merger and motivated by real-world evidence, we incorporate a probability that an RJV contract will fail to enforce R&D sharing. We find that a <b>horizontal</b> <b>agreement</b> always arises in equilibrium, which is consistent with empirical findings that R&D complementarities between firms positively influence the formation of <b>horizontal</b> <b>agreements.</b> The insiders’ merger/RJV choice involves a trade-off: While merger offers certainty that R&D complementarities will be exploited, it leads to a profit-reducing reaction by outsiders on the product market, where competition is Cournot. Greater contract enforceability (quality) and R&D investment costs both favour RJV. Interestingly, the insiders may choose to merge even when RJV contracts are always enforceable, and they may opt to form an RJV even when the likelihood of enforceability is negligible. We also explore the welfare implications of the firms’ merger/RJV choice...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the background, contents and airpolitical {{consequences of the}} so-called 'Horizontal Agreements ("HA"),' concluded by the European Union ("EU") with third countries {{to give effect to}} the European Court of Justice's ("Court"/"ECJ") decision of November 2002 in the 'Open Skies' cases brought by the European Commission ("EC"/"Commission") against certain EU Member States. The Court's decision outlaws the nationality or 'ownership and control' clause in the bilateral ('Open Skies') agreements concluded with the United States by those Member States. As this clause is a standard provision in all bilateral air services agreements, the Court's decision actually obliges the Member States to amend those agreements and replace the said clauses by provisions which do not discriminate on the basis of nationality. The Member States have in the meantime mandated the Commission to engage in such negotiations on their behalf {{on the basis of a}} jointly developed Model <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Agreement</b> ("MHA"), containing a non-discriminatory so-called Community clause and some other provisions on matters within the exclusive competence of the Community. This research thus examines the legal and airpolitical implications of these <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Agreements,</b> which the Commission has concluded in the meantime and continues to propose to third countries.

40|$|Antitrust law distinguishes {{vertical}} and horizontal restraints. A horizontal restraint is one which exists between competing firms supplying rival products in a market, and a vertical restraint is one which exists between firms that jointly contribute to supplying a particular product in a market. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>agreements</b> receive much closer antitrust scrutiny because they often enable firms to limit competition {{at the expense of}} consumers, while vertical restraints may be legal or illegal depending on whether they tend to enhance or reduce competition or the exploitation of market power. This paper argues that there are important vertical restraints that operate in sports leagues which have been mostly neglected in the literature but have a significant impact. We focus on intraleague restraints, where member clubs of a league agree to control the organization of league competition, and interleague restraints, where <b>horizontal</b> <b>agreement</b> such as the Reserve Clause relies on agreements not to compete for players competing in senior or junior leagues.

40|$|Abstract The paper {{develops}} a four step framework to detect <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>horizontal</b> mergers {{based on the}} application of back-of-the-envelope formulas. In {{the first step of}} the framework, an estimate of the impact of a horizontal merger on the market price needs to be derived. A homogenous Cournot model as well as a differentiated Bertrand model is used to derive back-of-the-envelope formulas which can be applied to estimate the expected percentage price increase post-merger. Subsequent, the second step of the framework has to assess whether the price increase predicted on the first stage would be sustainable post-merger. As simulation tools typically need to abstract from important factors- such as entry or product repositioning of existing rivals- these factors typically have to be assessed qualitatively. The third step of the framework needs to assess, first, whether the merger efficiencies claimed by the merging parties are existent, merger-specific and are likely to materialize post-merger. Second, it needs to be estimated whether the accepted efficiencies are substantial enough to at least hold the pre-merger price level. As in the first step of the framework, the two standard oligopoly models are applied to derive back-of-the-envelope formulas for the percentage cost reduction sufficient to hold the premerger price level. Finally, the fourth step of the framework needs to consider the effects of a horizontal merger on other competition variables such as product variety, marketing as well as R&D post-merger which might influence the overall welfare effects of a merger...|$|R

In a second part of the lecture we then look at the efficiency of new <b>horizontal</b> air service <b>agreements</b> (ASAs) signed by the European Union with several countries.

Based on OAG data analyses, literature reviews and stakeholder interviews, we find that market access is hardly facilitated and hence traffic hardly stimulated in cases in which bilateral frequency limitations or other restrictions are still in place. Also, <b>horizontal</b> <b>agreements</b> have not resolved day-to-day problems EU carriers face on the operational level in countries such as Azerbaijan, Armenia or Ukraine.

40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) The {{thesis is}} aimed to study <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Agreements</b> generally, with {{specific}} reference to Australian experience. It thus takes the basic arguments proposed by industry and evaluates these. In this regard the arguments {{put forward by}} the Associated Chamber of Manufacturers of Australia in vehemently opposing strong Trade Practices control are taken as the clearest articulated presentation of general arguments against Trade Practices legislation. Examples are taken of Australian industry as compared with evaluated industries overseas. Also studied are Australian political attitudes and the 1965 Trade Practices Act is evaluated. The thesis is written on material available up to about March 1972 although some annotations have been made since that date. Trade Practices are a continuing phenomena {{and it is not}} possible to be continually up to date in view of the changes occurring. At the time of writing there were only four reports of the Commissioner for Trade Practices available. The text was written prior to the announcement of the Attorney-General (Senator Greenwood) to Federal Parliament on 24 th May 1972 on future governmental intentions in the Trade Practices field and does not attempt to evaluate the merits of the Government's intentions in this regard. The thesis is restricted to <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Agreements</b> in the Commonwealth and, at the State level, deals primarily with New South Wales. At the stage of writing, both the Commonwealth and New South Wales had Liberal/Country Party Governments and the term "Government" refers (unless otherwise stated) to such Governments...|$|R

[...] The {{key difference}} was that [...] "courts analyze vertical agreements {{under the rule of}} reason, whereas <b>horizontal</b> <b>agreements</b> are violations per se." [...] The court then commented on the plaintiffs' motives:This distinction provides strong incentives for plaintiffs to plead a horizontal conspiracy (either alone or as part of a rimmed hub-and-spoke conspiracy).

But vertical exclusive dealing agreements are not per se illegal, so that hub-and-spoke conspiracies to establish exclusive dealing are mot per se illegal. To be per se illegal as a boycott, the IFDs must agree together not to deal with PepsiCo. [...] "A <b>horizontal</b> <b>agreement</b> is a prerequisite in a group boycott case."
