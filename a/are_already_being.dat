Apart from the screen itself the circuit boards and batteries would need to be flexible. Samsung demonstrated a roll-out display in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Sōtō is the Japanese {{line of the}} Chinese Caodong school, {{which was}} founded during the Tang Dynasty by Dongshan Liangjie. The Sōtō-school has de-{{emphasized}} kōans since Gentō Sokuchū (circa 1800), and instead emphasized shikantaza. Dogen, the founder of Soto in Japan, emphasised that practice and awakening cannot be separated. By practicing shikantaza, attainment and Buddhahood <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>being</b> expressed. For Dogen, zazen, or shikantaza, {{is the essence of}} Buddhist practice. Gradual cultivation was also recognized by Dongshan Liangjie.|$|E

These represent important advances in pharmacy {{education and the}} pharmacists' new critical role in Canada's health care system, {{and the use of}} the new building for Pharmacy is a symbol of the University of Toronto's dedication to health care and pharmaceutical research.|$|E
25|$|Forecasters now {{commonly}} {{suggest that}} western Canada's conventional gas production has peaked {{and will continue}} to decline. Gaps between traditional supply and growing demand <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>being</b> filled with gas from such diverse sources as tight sands; coalbed methane; and since January 2000, frontier gas and liquids from Nova Scotia's Sable Offshore Energy Project. Other likely future sources include Mackenzie Delta gas and liquefied natural gas from abroad. This suggests higher future costs and risks, and that suggests higher-priced future energy.|$|E

Having been badly injured in a gangland assassination attempt, his brain has been transplanted into an armoured robot body. Unknown to the judges, the Frendz Mob has sabotaged their new improved Mark II Lawgiver firearms, with which the street judges <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>being</b> issued.|$|E

25|$|As well {{as being}} aware of {{cryptographic}} history, cryptographic algorithm and system designers must also sensibly consider probable future developments while working on their designs. For instance, continuous improvements in computer processing power have increased the scope of brute-force attacks, so when specifying key lengths, the required key lengths are similarly advancing. The potential effects of quantum computing <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>being</b> considered by some cryptographic system designers developing post-quantum cryptography; the announced imminence of small implementations of these machines may be making the need for this preemptive caution rather more than merely speculative.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{knowledge}} available about the whole Antarctic ecosystem, large scale experiments involving krill <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>being</b> performed to increase carbon sequestration: in vast areas of the Southern Ocean {{there are plenty of}} nutrients, but still, the phytoplankton does not grow much. These areas are termed HNLC (high nutrient, low chlorophyll). The phenomenon is called the Antarctic Paradox, and occurs because iron is missing. Relatively small injections of iron from research vessels trigger very large blooms, covering many miles. The hope is that such large scale exercises will draw down carbon dioxide as compensation for the burning of fossil fuels.|$|E
25|$|As of 2008, {{the organic}} {{contaminants}} monitored by Mussel Watch included 51 PCB congeners (out {{of a possible}} 209), 65 PAHs, DDT, butyltin, chlordane, and dieldrin. A complete list is available at http://NSandT.noaa.gov. Most of the organic contaminants monitored by Mussel Watch have an anthropogenic source, with PAHs being an exception as they are derived from both natural processes and anthropogenic sources. PCB congeners were selected based off a list of criteria including that the chosen congeners <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>being</b> measured by other scientific organizations. Organic contaminants can be compared across all sites and all species used by Mussel Watch.|$|E

25|$|Colvin {{is nervous}} about {{meeting with the}} mayor because of his history with the police force but finds that Carcetti {{will not be in}} the meeting due to his meeting with the {{governor}} in Annapolis. Steintorf and Gerry are skeptical about the technique, characterizing it as tracking of students and leaving a subgroup behind. Colvin claims that the children <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>being</b> left behind and laughs about the system's refusal to admit its failings. Steintorf brings the meeting to a swift close. As they leave Colvin berates his shortcomings in the political arena. Parenti blames the failure on the process and seeks consolation in his academic findings.|$|E
25|$|In China, {{the term}} suburb is new, {{although}} suburbs <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>being</b> constructed rapidly. Chinese suburbs mostly consist of rows upon rows of apartment blocks and condos that end abruptly into the countryside. Also new town developments are extremely common. Single family suburban homes {{tend to be}} similar to their Western equivalents; although primarily outside Beijing and Shanghai, also mimic Spanish and Italian architecture. In Hong Kong, however, suburbs are mostly government-planned new towns containing numerous public housing estates. New Towns such as Tin Shui Wai may gain notoriety as a slum. However, other new towns also contain private housing estates and low density developments for the upper classes.|$|E
25|$|Travel on {{highways}} {{outside of}} {{towns and cities}} in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles. While a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt. In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must {{be paid to the}} presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road. The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country's roads. The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes. Completing the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>being</b> made.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to specific treatment, personalised medicine can greatly aid the advancements of preventive care. For instance, many women <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>being</b> genotyped for certain mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene {{if they are}} predisposed because of {{a family history of}} breast cancer or ovarian cancer. As more causes of diseases are mapped out according to mutations that exist within a genome, the easier they can be identified in an individual. Measures can then be taken to prevent a disease from developing. Even if mutations were found within a genome, having the details of their DNA can reduce the impact or delay the onset of certain diseases. Having the genetic content of an individual will allow better guided decisions in determining the source of the disease and thus treating it or preventing its progression. This will be extremely useful for diseases like Alzheimer’s or cancers that are thought to be linked to certain mutations in our DNA.|$|E
25|$|The Software Configuration Management system, is {{a system}} at the vendor’s site which keeps track of the {{configurations}} at the customer site. By storing this in a system the vendor {{will be able to}} give the customer particular service when it needs a new product. In the software configuration management system information about the products used by the customer, the version of these products, as well as which updates <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>being</b> done, is stored. In some cases {{it is possible that the}} vendor did some modifications to the product particularly for this customer. This will also have to be stored in the system. Also there needs to be configuration data, some generic information about the configuration the customer is using. For example what operating platform the customer uses for its software. What also should be stored in this system is information about the feedback that the vendor gets from the customer. This includes bug reports, product usage data, error reports and usage questions. More information about this feedback can be found in the CCU phase activation and usage.|$|E
