5|$|As a critic, Willis did {{not believe}} in {{including}} discussions of personalities of writers when reviewing their works. He <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that,</b> though publications should discuss political topics, they should not express party opinions or choose sides. The Mirror flourished {{at a time when many}} publications were discontinuing. Its success was due to the shrewd management of Willis and Morris and the two demonstrated that the American public could support literary endeavors. Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, Willis and Morris issued an anthology, The Prose and Poetry of America.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1948, the Soviet secret service took an {{interest}} in this area of medicine. One of those with overall responsibility for the Soviet secret police, pre-war Procurator General and State Prosecutor, the deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Vyshinsky, was the first to order the use of psychiatry as a tool of repression. Russian psychiatrist Pyotr Gannushkin <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> in a class society, especially during the most severe class struggle, psychiatry was incapable of not being repressive.

5|$|As the Belgian forces, {{together}} with their French and British allies, were forced to retreat, Leopold decided that surrendering the army was the only viable course of action. On 24 May, as the government was leaving the country for exile in France, a group of ministers including Pierlot held a final meeting with Leopold at the Kasteel van Wijnendale. They called for him to {{follow the example of}} the Norwegian king, Haakon VII, and join them in exile as a symbol of continued resistance. Leopold refused, believing that as commander, he should surrender alongside his army, provoking real animosity. He <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that,</b> by leaving for France, the Belgian government would surrender its neutrality and become a puppet government. He <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that,</b> as a neutral power with no formal treaty of alliance with France or Britain, the Belgian army was not obliged to hold out as long as it possibly could if it incurred huge casualties and had no change of defending its own territory. On 28 May, after a brief attempt to form a new government of sympathetic politicians under Henri De Man and after denouncing Pierlot and his government, Leopold surrendered to the Germans and was made a prisoner of war.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} of his novels, Balzac {{analyzes}} the influence of history and social status in La Cousine Bette. The book takes places between 1838 and 1846, when the reign of Louis-Philippe reflected and directed {{significant changes in the}} social structure. Balzac was a legitimist favoring the House of Bourbon, and idolized Napoleon Bonaparte as a paragon of effective absolutist power. Balzac felt that French society under the House of Orléans lacked strong leadership, and was fragmented by the demands of parliament. He <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> Catholicism provided guidance for the nation, and that its absence heralded moral decay.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{religious}} and ethnic discrimination, Roman Catholics in the late 19th century were regularly excluded from labor unions, popular fraternal organizations, and other organized groups that provided such social services. Papal encyclicals issued by the Holy See prohibited Catholics from participating as lodge members within Freemasonry. McGivney intended to create an alternative organization. He <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> Catholicism and fraternalism could be compatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men {{to be proud of}} their American-Catholic heritage.|$|E

5|$|Brock felt {{he needed}} to go further. He was {{hampered}} by Governor General George Prevost, who had replaced Craig in late 1811. Prevost's orders from the government, and his own inclinations, were to emphasise defence. Prevost kept {{the bulk of his}} forces in Lower Canada to protect Quebec, and opposed any attack into United States. Brock <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> he was handicapped by inertia and defeatism among the Legislature and other officials.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{successful}} morning attack, {{access to an}} open escape route, and to the amazement of Floyd and Buckner, Pillow ordered his men back to their trenches by 1:30p.m. Buckner confronted Pillow, and Floyd intended to countermand the order, but Pillow argued that his men needed to regroup and resupply before evacuating the fort. Pillow won the argument. Floyd <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> C. F. Smith's division was being heavily reinforced, so the entire Confederate force was ordered back inside the lines of Fort Donelson, giving up the ground they gained earlier that day.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, several {{searches}} {{of the waters}} around North Stradbroke and Moreton Islands failed to reveal Centaurs location.

Some parties <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> Rippon's calculated point of sinking was inaccurate, either intentionally or through error.|$|E

5|$|Ghosh {{went against}} the {{expectations}} of casting a popular actor from Bollywood. He signed Bengali actor Abir Chatterjee to play Vidya's husband. According to Ghosh, popular Bollywood actors were not {{willing to work with}} him after his two previous flops. He <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> audience might expect more screen-time from a better-known actor. Several other Bengali film and television actors, such as Indraneil Sengupta and Kharaj Mukherjee, were cast in supporting roles.|$|E
5|$|He continued, {{describing}} the unhappiness of his marriage, {{and how that}} made him vulnerable to her attributes, which were shared by all the learned gentlemen of his circle. He <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> Anna Seward had noticed the effect her friend was having on him, and would regularly place her actions in the best light for his benefit.

5|$|Lamarck {{proposed}} the transmutation of species ("transformisme"), {{but did not}} believe that all living things shared a common ancestor.
