A member of the Roman Catholic minority in Vietnam, he pursued pro-Catholic policies that antagonized many Buddhists. Specifically, historians regard the government as being biased towards Catholics in public service and military promotions, {{as well as in}} the allocation of land, business favors, and tax concessions.|$|E
5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> {{surveys of}} the {{religious}} composition estimated the Buddhist majority to be between 70 and 90 percent, {{the policies of the}} staunchly Catholic President Ngô Đình Diệm generated claims of religious bias. As a member of the Catholic Vietnamese minority, he is widely regarded by historians as having pursued pro-Catholic policies that antagonized many Buddhists. Specifically, the government was regarded as being biased towards Catholics in public service and military promotions, as well as the allocation of land, business favors and tax concessions.|$|E
5|$|The prose, while simple at {{the level}} of the {{sentence}} (and we can safely assume that Hofmann's translation is very faithful to the original), is shifty, blurred, to the point where at times we are left unsure as to what exactly is going on – a deliberate flight from causation, quite understandable in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> everyone (even, we learn, the horses) has been driven mad by fear.|$|E

5|$|This Counter-Reformation {{offensive}} happened somewhat mysteriously in <b>a</b> <b>country,</b> <b>where</b> {{there were}} no religious wars and the state had not cooperated with the Catholic Church in eradicating or limiting competing denominations. Among the factors responsible, low Protestant involvement among the masses, especially of peasantry, pro-Catholic position of the kings, low level of involvement of the nobility once the religious emancipation had been accomplished, internal divisions within the Protestant movement, and the rising intensity of the Catholic Church propaganda, have been listed.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} {{position of}} Islamic scholars {{had been that}} a Muslim could not stay in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> rulers made proper religious observance impossible: therefore, a Muslim's obligation was to leave when they were able to. Even before the systematic forced conversion, religious leaders had argued that Muslims in Christian territory {{would be subject to}} direct and indirect pressure, and preached emigration as a way to protect the religion from eroding. Ahmad al-Wansharis, the contemporary North African scholar and leading authority on Spanish Muslims, wrote in 1491 that emigrating from Christian to Muslim lands was compulsory in almost all circumstances. Further, he urged severe punishment for Muslims who remained and predicted that they would temporarily dwell in hell in the afterlife.|$|E

With over 515,000 likes on Facebook, Valor por Tamaulipas routinely posted messages and photos of crime scenes on its page. In <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> many journalists have been assassinated for writing about drug trafficking and organized crime, the page survives under anonymity, {{but it has not}} been immune to threats.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{competition between}} a domestic intellectual property right holder and a foreign imitator and consider how parallel imports affect their prof-its.

The intellectual property right holder can sell the products for both markets while the imitator cannot export the products to <b>Country</b> <b>A.</b> We find that permitting parallel imports can be beneficial for both players because {{it serves as a}} commitment device to soften price competition...|$|R

5|$|Work Kommandos {{were very}} variable, but those in {{agriculture}} were generally considered better than ones in factories or mining, where conditions were worse and prisoners were vulnerable to Allied bombing raids. In {{rural areas of}} Germany, French prisoners replaced locals conscripted into the German army as agricultural labourers. Guarding Kommandos came {{to be regarded as}} an unnecessary waste of manpower - it was thought unlikely that a prisoner would attempt to escape in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> he did not know the language. This meant that, in practice, prisoners were allowed a wider measure of freedom compared to the camps. They were often viewed with curiosity by the German rural population, and the French prisoners were often allowed to mix quite freely with German civilians. Although unlawful, many French prisoners began relationships with German women.|$|E
