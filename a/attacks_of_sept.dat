500|$|Lieber's most {{productive}} season came in 2001. On May 24, he one-hit the Cincinnati Reds, 3–0, ending the team's NL-record streak of 208 {{games in a}} row without being shut out, throwing just 78 pitches. From June 16 to July 15, he won six straight games. He was named an All-Star for the first and only time in his career. In his final start of the season on October 3, he allowed five runs in six innings but still earned his 20th win of the season as the Cubs beat the Reds 137. In 34 starts, Lieber recorded a career-high 20 victories to go with just six losses, posted a 3.80 ERA, and struck out 148 as opposed to 41 walks. His 20 wins ranked fourth in the league (behind Matt Morris's and Schilling's 22 and Johnson's 21), his [...] innings pitched ranked fifth in the league, and his five complete games tied for second in the league with Javier Vázquez (behind Johnson's six). He finished fourth in the NL Cy Young Award vote, behind Johnson, Schilling, and Morris. Due to the terrorist <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sept.</b> 11, 2001 and the week-long break in the baseball season, Lieber became the first Cubs pitcher to start consecutive contests since Scott Sanderson on May 18 and May 20 of 1986.|$|E

50|$|Buildings {{such as the}} National Cathedral, Biltmore Estate, Empire State Building, the Pentagon, the Crescent (Dallas), the Hotel Pennsylvania, and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum feature Indiana {{limestone}} {{in their}} exteriors. Indiana limestone was used extensively in rebuilding Chicago after the Great Chicago Fire. Built from 1890-1893, Indiana's Wayne County Courthouse is also made of Salem limestone. 1959's architecturally significant St. Augustine's Episcopal Church uses Indiana limestone in the interior. The Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church in Merrillville, Indiana, consecrated in 1991 and awarded a Gold Medal Award for Excellence in Masonry Design, uses Indiana limestone on its exterior facade. The new Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, which opened in 2009, extensively uses Indiana limestone paneling on its exterior facade. The original 1930s buildings of Rockefeller Center use limestone from Bedford. In 1955 the Tennessee State Capitol exterior was renovated using Indiana limestone to replace the poorer quality Tennessee limestone that had started to deteriorate. Indiana limestone {{was used in the}} rebuilding of the Pentagon after the terrorist <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sept.</b> 11, 2001.

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether U. S. newspaper framing of international conflict shifted following the Sept. 11 terrorist attack and the U. S. government's initiation of a global war on terrorism. Palestinian/Israeli violence, long a focus of international media and scholarly attention, has been rhetorically tied to terrorism and is the topic of this research. The questions motivating this study include: How did the terrorist attack on U. S. soil alter the nature and/or quantity of U. S. media commentary about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict? What does this commentary suggest {{about the nature of}} U. S. media framing of international conflict that is rhetorically tied to U. S. policy objectives and socio-cultural interests but does not involve direct U. S. military intervention? How far-reaching are the effects of a cataclysmic event on media framing, and what are they? Media effects theory, social construction theory, and framing theory are primary foundations for this study. Thus, media messages are presumed to affect the audience, and significant changes in media content are presumed to alter audience understanding of the world. However, this study looks not at the effects of media coverage but at the semantic and narrative elements of media content (the frames) that construct and transmit meanings. A close qualitative reading, supplemented by limited quantitative descriptions, of thirteen months of unsigned editorial comment in The New York Times provides the data for this analysis. Although much framing research focuses on news content, editorial-page commentary is a useful bellwether of a newspaper's dominant frames because unsigned editorials express the newspaper's public stance on issues and establish a context for reader decoding of news stories. This study found the <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sept.</b> 11 did not influence the frequency of New York Times editorial comment on the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. However, this and other dramatic events during the period of study altered the dominant frame of reference for this discussion. Thus, in the weeks immediately following the Sept. 11 attack, the New York Times editorial page was more likely to frame Israeli/Palestinian conflict in terms of U. S. strategic interest in the region. Such effects were temporally limited. However, editorial framing of the two parties to the conflict consistently differed throughout the period. In general, New York Times editorials were likely to depersonalize Palestinians and frame them as aggressors rather than victims. Commentary on Israeli acts of violence, in contrast, often favored law and order frames, and the personal suffering of Israeli victims frequently provided the context for discussion of regional violence. ...|$|R

While SEPT 12 formed filamentous structures at interphase, it was localized to the central spindle and to midbody during anaphase and cytokinesis, respectively. In addition, we found that SEPT 12 can interact with SEPT 6 in vitro and in vivo, and this interaction was independent of the coiled coil domain <b>of</b> <b>SEPT</b> 6. Further, co-expression <b>of</b> <b>SEPT</b> 12 altered the filamentous structure <b>of</b> <b>SEPT</b> 6 in Hela cells.

5000|$|Gates' tenure {{with the}} Obama {{administration}} included a huge shift in military spending.

The budget cuts included many programs geared toward conventional warfare, {{such as the}} end of new orders of the F-22 Raptor, and further development of Future Combat Systems manned vehicles. However, these cuts were counterbalanced by increases in funding for programs like the special forces. Gates called this the [...] "nation's first truly 21st century defense budget." [...] In late April 2010, he suggested the Navy cease funding development of a new multibillion-dollar ballistic missile submarine program on the grounds of cost and relevancy.
