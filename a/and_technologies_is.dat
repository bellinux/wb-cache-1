5000|$|Media {{convergence}} in {{the digital}} era means {{the changes that are}} taking place with older forms of media and media companies. Media convergence has two roles, the first is the technological merging of different media channels - for example, magazines, radio programs, TV shows, and movies, now are available on the Internet through laptops, iPads, and smartphones. As discussed in Media Culture (by Campbell), convergence of technology is not new. It has been going on since the late 1920s. An example is RCA, the Radio Corporation of America, which purchased Victor Talking Machine Company and introduced machines that could receive radio and play recorded music. Next came the TV, and radio lost some of its appeal as people started watching television, which has both talking and music as well as visuals. As technology advances, convergence of media change to keep up. The second definition of media convergence Campbell discusses is cross-platform by media companies. This usually involves consolidating various media holdings, such as cable, phone, television (over the air, satellite, cable) and Internet access under one corporate umbrella. This is not for the consumer to have more media choices, this is {{for the benefit of the}} company to cut down on costs and maximize its profits. [...] As stated in the article, Convergence Culture and Media Work, by Mark Deuze, “the convergence of production and consumption of media across companies, channels, genres, <b>and</b> <b>technologies</b> <b>is</b> an expression of the convergence of all aspects of everyday life: work and play, the local and the global, self and social identity." ...|$|E
