Methods: We included 673 men aged 70 – 71 y and not receiving antihypertensive medication from the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men. Of those, 378 men attended re-examination after 7 y. Dietary <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> was estimated at baseline by potential renal <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP), based on nutrient intake assessed by 7 -d food records at baseline.

The {{purpose of the current}} studies was to better understand the specific role of Rhcg expression in intercalated cells in basal and metabolic acidosis-stimulated renal ammonia excretion. We generated mice with intercalated cell-specific Rhcg deletion (IC-Rhcg-KO) using Cre-loxP techniques; control (C) mice were floxed Rhcg but Cre negative. Under basal conditions, IC-Rhcg-KO and C mice excreted urine with similar ammonia content and pH. Mice were then acid loaded by adding HCl to their diet.

40|$|Rh B {{glycoprotein}} (Rhbg) is {{a member}} of the Rh glycoprotein family of ammonia transporters. In the current study, we examine Rhbg's role in basal and acidosis-stimulated acid-base homeostasis. Metabolic acidosis induced by HCl administration increased Rhbg expression in both the cortex and outer medulla. To test the functional significance of increased Rhbg expression, we used a Cre-loxP approach to generate mice with intercalated cell-specific Rhbg knockout (IC-Rhbg-KO). On normal diet, intercalated cell-specific Rhbg deletion did not alter urine ammonia excretion, pH, or titratable acid excretion significantly, but it did decrease glutamine synthetase expression in the outer medulla significantly. After metabolic acidosis was induced, urinary ammonia excretion was significantly less in IC-Rhbg-KO than in control (C) mice on days 2 – 4 of <b>acid</b> <b>loading,</b> but not on day 5. Urine pH and titratable acid excretion and dietary acid intake did not differ significantly between acid-loaded IC-Rhcg-KO and C mice.

Because acute studies are best designed to elucidate the mechanism, renal or extra renal, underlying hypercalciuria in the setting of enhanced <b>acid</b> <b>load,</b> we examined the response of 9 healthy adults (8 males, 1 female, aged 38 ± 3 years, weight 67 ± 2 kg) and 34 hypercalciuric recurrent calcium stone formers (31 males, 3 females, aged 44 ± 2 years, weight 72 ± 2 kg), without any associated disease, to an oral <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> (NH 4 Cl 2 mmol/kg body wt). After an overnight fast, each patient and control was studied during one one-hour period before and three two-hour periods after their intake of the <b>acid</b> <b>load.</b> An additional group of four time-control subjects (4 males, aged 33 ± 2 years, weight 66 ± 2 kg) was studied as the experimental groups except that they did not receive the <b>acid</b> <b>load.</b> On baseline, the three groups exhibited similar glomerular filtration rates, net acid excretions, and plasma calcium and magnesium concentrations. However, fasting urine calcium and magnesium excretions were higher in hypercalciuric calcium stone formers than in healthy control or time-control subjects. In time-control subjects, plasma acid base status, net <b>acid</b> excretion, filtered <b>loads</b> of calcium and magnesium, and urinary calcium and magnesium excretions remained unchanged all over the study. By contrast, after the oral acute <b>acid</b> <b>load,</b> net <b>acid</b> excretion increased and urinary pH decreased similarly in patient and control groups; glomerular filtration rate did not change, as well as plasma calcium and magnesium concentrations. Nevertheless, urinary calcium and magnesium excretions markedly increased, in both groups, independently of changes in tubular sodium handling and in plasma parathyroid hormone concentration. The increase in urinary calcium and magnesium excretions that occurred {{in the absence of any}} change in the filtered load of calcium and magnesium was therefore mediated by a decrease in tubular calcium and magnesium reabsorption, independent of PTH, but dependent on changes in net acid excretion. A positive linear relationship between urinary calcium and magnesium excretions suggested that the target tubular site for <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> was the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. Finally, a negative linear relationship was demonstrated between the acid load-induced increase in urinary calcium excretion and fasting urinary calcium excretion; indeed, the lowest calciuric responses were observed in patients with the highest fasting urinary calcium excretion. Thus there was no additional effect of the acid load-induced inhibition on intrinsic defect in tubular calcium reabsorption which suggests that the tubular target site for <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> and the site of calcium transport defect in idiopathic hypercalciuria may be the same...|$|R

When a large inorganic <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> is ingested by normals, the proton load is eliminated because the rate of excretion of ammonium can rise to 200 to 300 mmol/day. In subjects with ketoacidosis of chronic fasting, such a large increase {{in the rate of}} excretion of ammonium might not be possible because of ATP balance considerations in proximal cells. Subjects with ketoacidosis of chronic fasting excreted less net acid as defined in the conventional way when they consumed a large inorganic <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> (136 ± 6 vs. 176 ± 26 mmol/day in control fasted subjects). Nevertheless, the vast majority of this inorganic <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> was eliminated because they were in steady state and had only a slightly lower concentration of bicarbonate (13 ± 0. 6 vs. 15 ± 0. 5 mmol/liter) and ketoacid anions (3. 3 ± 0. 2 vs. 5. 5 ± 0. 2 mmol/liter) in their blood. Using a definition of net acid excretion where the component of bicarbonate loss was expanded to include “potential bicarbonate” (ketoacid anions) in the urine, the rate of excretion of net acid was higher in subjects who ingested the inorganic <b>acid</b> <b>load,</b> owing to a much lower rate of excretion of ketoacid anions (9 ± 2 vs. 120 ± 7 mmol/day). This lower rate of excretion was not only due to a lower filtered load, but also to a higher fractional reabsorption of ketoacid anions during acidosis (97 ± 0. 1 vs. 77 ± 0. 2 %). This higher fractional reabsorption could not be explained by a lower filtered load of ketoacid anions or to a restricted intake of sodium.

In the presence of 5 % CO 2 and 24 mm HCO 3 −, the intracellular pH (pHi) rapidly changes due to a potent, reversible Na+-HCO 3 − cotransport across the glial membrane. We have now investigated the transport mechanism which leads to pHi changes in the nominal absence of CO 2 /HCO 3 −, where the HCO 3 − concentration {{is expected to be}} below 1 mm. The intracellular pH increased and then decreased when pHo was altered from 7. 4 to 7. 8 and then 7. 0 with a rate of increase of + 0. 026 ± 0. 008 and a rate of decrease of − 0. 028 ± 0. 009 pH units min− 1 (± s. d., n = 49), indicating an acid/base flux rate of 0. 64 and 0. 71 mm min− 1 across the glial membrane, respectively. In the absence of external sodium (Na+replaced by N-methyl-D-glucamine), pHi slowly decreased, and the rate of alkali and <b>acid</b> <b>loading</b> was reduced to 19 and 28 %, respectively, (n = 12). Amiloride (2 mm), which inhibits Na+-H+ exchange, had no effect on the alkali/acid loading (n = 6). The alkali and <b>acid</b> <b>loading</b> were not impaired after the removal of external chloride (Clo−, replaced by gluconate; n = 11), but were significantly reduced by the anion transport inhibitor 4, 4 ′-diisothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulphonic acid (DIDS, 0. 5 mm) to 23 and 16 %, respectively, of the control (P < 0. 001; n = 5). Alkali and <b>acid</b> <b>loading</b> were affected differently by manipulating the availability of residual HCO 3 −. After adding the membrane-permeable carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ethoxyzolamide (EZA, 2 μm) to the saline, the <b>acid</b> <b>loading,</b> but not the alkali loading, was significantly reduced (by 25 %, P < 0. 01), while lowering the residual CO 2 /HCO 3 − concentration in the saline by O 2 bubbling significantly reduced the alkali loading (by 59 %, P < 0. 02), but not the <b>acid</b> <b>loading.</b> Changing the membrane holding potential in voltage-clamped glial cells or raising the external K+ concentration to 30 mm had no significant effect on acid/base loading.

The results suggest a very high selectivity and affinity of this cotransporter for HCO 3 −; they imply that HCO 3 −-dependent processes may not be negligible even in the nominal absence of CO 2 /HCO 3 −, when the HCO 3 − concentration is expected to be in the submillimolar range...|$|E

Hypertension risk was not significantly associated with dietary <b>acid</b> <b>load.</b> The multivariate HRs (95 % CIs) in consecutive tertiles of PRAL were 1. 00 (reference), 1. 01 (0. 87, 1. 17), and 1. 02 (0. 88, 1. 18) (P trend = 0. 83). The median dietary <b>acid</b> <b>loads</b> were 30. 4, 36. 7, and 43. 7 mEq/d, respectively, in consecutive tertiles of NEAP. Corresponding HRs for NEAP were 1. 00 (reference), 0. 92 (0. 80, 1. 07), and 0. 94 (0. 81, 1. 10) (P-trend = 0. 46). Conclusion: The findings from this prospective cohort study provided no evidence of an association between dietary <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> and risk of hypertension in older adult...|$|R

40|$|C {{glycoprotein}} (Rhcg) is an NH 3 -specific transporter {{expressed in}} both intercalated cells (IC) and principal cells (PC) in the renal collecting duct. Recent {{studies show that}} deletion of Rhcg from both intercalated and principal cells inhibits both basal and acidosis-stimulated renal ammonia excretion. The {{purpose of the current}} studies was to better understand the specific role of Rhcg expression in intercalated cells in basal and metabolic acidosis-stimulated renal ammonia excretion. We generated mice with intercalated cell-specific Rhcg deletion (IC-Rhcg-KO) using Cre-loxP techniques; control (C) mice were floxed Rhcg but Cre negative. Under basal conditions, IC-Rhcg-KO and C mice excreted urine with similar ammonia content and pH. Mice were then acid loaded by adding HCl to their diet. Ammonia excretion after <b>acid</b> <b>loading</b> increased similarly in IC-Rhcg-KO and C mice during the first 2 days of <b>acid</b> <b>loading</b> but on day 3 was significantly less in IC-Rhcg-KO than in C mice.

It is not known whether protein type or net <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> is associated with risk of kidney stones. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We prospectively examined intakes of protein (dairy, nondairy animal, and vegetable), potassium, and animal protein-to-potassium ratio (an estimate of net <b>acid</b> <b>load)</b> and risk of incident kidney stones in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (n= 42, 919), the Nurses' Health Study I (n= 60, 128), and the Nurses' Health Study II (n= 90, 629). Multivariable models were adjusted for age, body mass index, diet, and other factors. We also analyzed cross-sectional associations with 24 -hour urine (n= 6129). RESULTS: During 3, 108, 264 person-years of follow-up, there were 6308 incident kidney stones.

Effects on feed intake and milk production of dairy cows offered grass or corn silages. ? Journal of Dairy Science, 84, (12), 2721 - 2729. Earlier studies {{developed a new}} approach to feed evaluation, measuring the net <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> that develops during rumen fermentation. Two concentrates were formulated to be isoenergetic and isonitrogenous, with extremes of rumen <b>acid</b> <b>load.</b> A third treatment comprised a 50 : 50 mixture of these concentrates. These concentrates were evaluated along with ryegrass silage and corn silage. The feeds were evaluated in a continuous culture system adapted to deliver and record the quantities of acid or alkali needed to maintain a constant pH (6. 2 to 6. 3). This study confirmed the anticipated ranking of concentrates for rumen <b>acid</b> <b>load,</b> as well as the highly acidogenic nature of corn silage. The concentrates were formulated to balance corn silage and were offered to early-lactation Holstein-Friesian cows at 50 % of dry matter intake, with either ryegrass silage or corn silage. Feed intake was lower for animals offered corn silage-based diets (17. 4 vs. 22. 2 kg of dry matter/d). Increasing concentrate <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> led to a large decline in dry matter intake for corn silage, although not for grass silage. Feed intake effects were reflected in significant effects on yield of milk (31. 0, 29. 9, and 26. 9 kg/ d for low-, medium-, and high-acid load concentrates, respectively) and milk solids. Milk protein concentration was unaffected by concentrate type with corn silage diets but tended to be higher when high <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> concentrates were fed with grass silage. This may reflect the effect of the high starch concentrate rectifying a shortage of glucogenic precursors or microbial protein with the grass silage-based diet. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|It is {{possible}} that some orally administered citrate may appear in urine by escaping oxidation in vivo. To determine whether this mechanism contributes to the citraturic response to potassium citrate, we measured serum and urinary citrate for 4 hours after a single oral <b>load</b> of citric <b>acid</b> (40 mEq.) in 6 normal subjects. Since citric acid does not alter acid-base balance, the effect of absorbed citrate could be isolated from that of alkali load. Serum citrate concentration increased significantly (p less than 0. 05) 30 minutes after a single oral dose of citric acid and remained significantly elevated for 3 hours after citric <b>acid</b> <b>load.</b> Commensurate with this change, urinary citrate excretion peaked at 2 hours and gradually decreased during the next 2 hours after citric <b>acid</b> <b>load.</b> In contrast, serum and urinary citrate remained unaltered following the control load (no drug). Differences of the citratemic and citraturic effects between phases were significant (p less than 0. 05) at 2 and 3 hours. Urinary pH, carbon dioxide pressure, bicarbonate, total carbon dioxide and ammonium did not change at any time after citric <b>acid</b> <b>load,</b> and did not differ between the 2 phases. No significant difference was noted in serum electrolytes, arterialized venous pH and carbon dioxide pressure at any time after citric <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> and between the 2 phases. Thus, the citraturic and citratemic effects of oral citric acid are largely accountable by provision of absorbed citrate, which has escaped in vivo degradation...|$|R

In this study, we investigated the impact of dynamic, aquaporin-mediated changes of Lp(r) on leaf growth, water potential, and water flux throughout the plant. For this, we manipulated Lp(r) by subjecting roots to four independent treatments, with aquaporin inhibitors applied either to transpiring maize (Zea mays) plants grown in hydroponics or to detopped root systems for estimation of Lp(r). The treatments were <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> at pH 6. 0 and 5. 0 and hydrogen peroxide and anoxia applied for 1 to 2 h and subsequently reversed. First, we established that <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> affected cell {{hydraulic conductivity}} in maize root cortex. Lp(r) was reduced by all treatments by 31 % to 63 %, with half-times of about 15 min, and partly recovered when treatments were reversed. Cell turgor measured in the elongating zone of leaves decreased synchronously with Lp(r), and leaf elongation rate closely followed these changes across all treatments in a dose-dependent manner. Leaf and xylem water potentials also followed changes in Lp(r). Stomatal conductance and rates of transpiration and water uptake were not affected by Lp(r) reduction under low evaporative demand. Increased evaporative demand, when combined with <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> at pH 6. 0, induced stomatal closure and amplified all other responses without altering their synchrony. Root pressurization reversed the impact of <b>acid</b> <b>load</b> or anoxia on leaf elongation rate and water potential, further indicating that changes in turgor mediated the response of leaf growth to reductions in Lp(r) ...|$|R
