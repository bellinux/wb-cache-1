5|$|Starting in 1832, <b>abolitionist</b> and {{journalist}} William Lloyd Garrison organized anti-slavery associations which encouraged the full participation of women.

5|$|Harriet Tubman (born Araminta Ross; March 10, 1913) was an American <b>abolitionist,</b> humanitarian, and {{an armed}} scout and spy for the United States Army during the American Civil War. Born into slavery, Tubman escaped and {{subsequently}} made some thirteen missions to rescue approximately seventy enslaved people, family and friends, using {{the network of}} antislavery activists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad. She later helped <b>abolitionist</b> John Brown recruit men for his raid on Harpers Ferry, and in the post-war era was {{an active participant in}} the struggle for women's suffrage.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to living}} in Seneca Falls, Stanton had become an admirer and friend of Lucretia Mott, the Quaker minister, feminist, and <b>abolitionist</b> whom she had met at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, England {{in the spring of}} 1840 while on her honeymoon. The two women became allies when the male delegates {{attending}} the convention voted that women should be denied participation in the proceedings, even if they, like Mott, had been nominated to serve as official delegates of their respective <b>abolitionist</b> societies. After considerable debate, the women were required to sit in a roped-off section hidden from the view of the men in attendance. They were soon joined by the prominent <b>abolitionist,</b> William Lloyd Garrison, who arrived after the vote had been taken and, in protest of the outcome, refused his seat, electing instead to sit with the women.|$|E

2500|$|Both Army commanders under General Sherman were <b>abolitionists</b> {{who opposed}} slavery. General Oliver O. Howard of the Army of the Tennessee and General Henry W.

5|$|During the 1850s, Utica {{was known}} to aid more than 650 {{fugitive}} slaves; it {{played a major role}} as a station in the Underground Railroad. The city was on a slave escape route from the Southern Tier to Canada by way of Albany, Syracuse and Rochester. The route, used by Harriet Tubman to travel to Buffalo, guided slaves to pass through Utica on the New York Central Railroad right-of-way en route to Canada. Utica was the locus for Methodist preacher Orange Scott's antislavery sermons during the 1830s and 1840s, and Scott formed an <b>abolitionist</b> group there in 1843. Despite efforts by local abolitionists, pro-slavery riots and mobs, who wanted to protect the cotton mills, forced many <b>abolitionist</b> meetings to other cities.|$|E

5000|$|Buchanan was irked {{that the}} <b>abolitionists,</b> in his view, were {{preventing}} {{the solution to}} the slavery problem. He stated, [...] "Before <b>abolitionists</b> commenced this agitation, a very large and growing party existed in several of the slave states in favor of the gradual abolition of slavery; and now not a voice is heard there in support of such a measure. The <b>abolitionists</b> have postponed the emancipation of the slaves in three or four states for at least half a century." ...|$|R
2500|$|Temple {{later wrote}} that he and others {{abandoned}} their anti-slavery stance due to the social ostracism <b>abolitionists</b> faced in the South. [...] Historian Robert McKenzie, however, argues that the aggression of northern <b>abolitionists</b> toward Southerners pushed many Southern <b>abolitionists</b> toward pro-slavery views, though {{he points out that}} no one explanation neatly explains this shift. [...] In any case, by the late-1850s, most of Knoxville's leaders were pro-slavery. The views of Brownlow and Ramsey, bitter enemies on many fronts, were virtually identical on the issue of slavery.|$|R

[...] New England Quarterly 1966 39(4): 474-497. in JSTOR; Argues Hayes {{had been}} {{convinced}} since 1875 that Grant's approach toward the South {{had to be}} abandoned and hoped to substitute conciliation for coercion, believing that the good will of Southern upper class whites would provide better protection for Blacks than the hated Federal troops. A majority of <b>abolitionists</b> disagreed, but about 36% of <b>abolitionists</b> supported Hayes, thereby causing a decided division in their ranks.|$|R
5|$|In addition, {{during the}} 1850s Smith gained {{prominence}} with African American readers and <b>abolitionist</b> readers of all ethnicities for his regularly published (often weekly) columns in Frederick Douglass Paper.

50|$|The act was {{supported}} by some <b>abolitionists,</b> including Olaudah Equiano, an African who was a former slave.

50|$|One of the {{arguments}} put forward by <b>abolitionists</b> against protectionism is that small improvements in animal welfare serve to salve consciences by persuading the public that their use of animals is not unethical. Welfare reform can therefore be counter-productive. <b>Abolitionists</b> also argue that real reform is invariably unsuccessful, because industries that depend on animal use will not implement change that harms their profit margin. That is, the property status of animals prohibits reform that will harm their owners' interests. For that reason, <b>abolitionists</b> argue, it is the property status of animals that must be removed.|$|R
