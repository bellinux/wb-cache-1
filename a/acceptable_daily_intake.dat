25|$|The {{purpose of}} calculating dietary {{exposure}} to a given chemical or contaminant is so the estimated dietary exposure {{can be compared to}} a relevant health standard such as the <b>acceptable</b> <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> (ADI), the acute reference dose (ARfD) or reference dose (RfD), or a level known to cause adverse effects in animal or human health studies.

25|$|According to the National Pesticide Information Center fact sheet, {{glyphosate}} is {{not included}} in compounds tested for by the Food and Drug Administration's Pesticide Residue Monitoring Program, nor in the United States Department of Agriculture's Pesticide Data Program. However, a field test showed that lettuce, carrots, and barley contained glyphosate residues up to one year after the soil was treated with 3.71lb of glyphosate per acre (4.15kg per hectare).

5000|$|Tolerable weekly intake (TWI) {{estimates}} the amount per unit body {{weight of a}} potentially harmful substance or contaminant in food or water that can be ingested over a lifetime without risk of adverse health effects.

40|$|Contamination by DDT group {{pesticides}} (p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDD = DDTs) {{was determined}} in fish and bivalve molluscs. Mean DDT concentrations ranged from 0. 24 - 6. 63 mug/kg w. wt. Higher values {{were found in}} fish (0. 24 - 6. 63 mug/kg w. wt) than in bivalve molluscs (0. 46 - 1. 43 mug/kg w. wt). In both types of seafood p,p'-DDE was the prevalent compound. Among the various zones of Italy (Northern, Central, Southern and the Islands) a difference in dietary patterns exists. In northern Italy there is a lower consumption of seafood than in the Central, South and Islands, where fish is a relevant part of the diet. Therefore, organochlorine pesticide intake and, consequently, health risk may differ, in relation to place of residence {{and the kind of}} food consumed.

40|$|Three female {{fish species}} of Snapper (Lutjanus goreensis), Herring (Sardinella maderensis) and Oarfish (Regalecus glesne) were sampled from Lagos Lagoon {{during the dry}} and wet seasons of 2008 and 2009 and {{subjected}} to cold extraction and clean-up procedure. Their muscle tissues were analysed for chlorinated hydrocarbons because they can concen trate pesticide residues from sediments and water. The identification and quantitation of the chlorinated hydrocarbon residues were performed using a gas chromatograph with a 63 Ni electron capture detector. The fishes had condition factor of more than 1 except Regalecus glesne. A higher concentration of the residues was observed during the dry season. The residue distribution pattern in muscle tissues of the fishes were: Regalecus glesne > Sardinella maderensis > Lutjanus goreensis. Regalecus glesne recorded the highest chlorinated hydrocarbon content: 6181. 16 ng/g.

40|$|In 2005, 30 % of all alcohol {{consumption}} in Russia was unrecorded. This paper describes the chemical composition of unrecorded and low cost alcohol, including a toxicological evaluation. Alcohol products (n= 22) from both recorded and unrecorded sources {{were obtained from}} three Russian cities (Saratov, Lipetsk and Irkutsk) and were chemically analyzed. Unrecorded alcohols included homemade samogons, medicinal alcohols and surrogate alcohols. Analysis included alcoholic strength, levels of volatile compounds (methanol, acetaldehyde, higher alcohols), ethyl carbamate, diethyl phthalate (DEP) and polyhexamethyleneguanidine hydrochloride (PHMG). Single samples showed contamination with DEP (275 – 1269 mg/l) and PHMG (515 mg/l) above levels of toxicological concern. Our detailed chemical analysis of Russian alcohols showed that the composition of vodka, samogon and medicinal alcohols generally did not raise major public health concerns other than for ethanol.

40|$|Bonga fish (Ethmalosa fimbriata) and African Moony (Psettias sebae) were sampled from Lagos Lagoon and {{analysed}} for organochlorine pesticide residues namely aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, DDT, heptachlor, HCH, endosulfan, chlordane and methoxychlor. Sampling was conducted between December 2008 and September 2009 {{during the dry}} and wet seasons. The muscle tissues of the fishes were subjected to cold extraction with petroleum ether/acetone (1 : 1 v/v) mixture and clean-up on silica gel adsorbents. Gas chromatography was used to detect and determine the organochlorine pesticide residues. The residue levels were higher in Ethmalosa fimbriata {{during the dry season}} while Psettias sebae had higher levels during the wet season. The male fishes accumulated higher organochlorine pesticides than the female fishes. The total detectable organochlorines (wet weight) of the muscle tissues ranged from 5. 72 ng/g in female Ethmalosa fimbriata during the wet season to 3005. 35 ng/g in male Ethmalosa fimbriata.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{integrate}} existing chemical residue and food consumption data for individuals to improve estimates of the dietary intake of chemical residues in the population of Brisbane. Previous estimates of intakes from the Australian Market Basket Survey (AMBS) {{have been based on}} energy-adjusted 2 ̆ 7 hypothetical national diets 2 ̆ 7 and so allow no assessment of variation in intakes between individuals or groups. Data on concentrations of fenitrothion, chlorpyrifos-methyl, pirimiphos-methyl, heptachlor and dieldrin in selected foods were taken from reports of the AMBS. Food consumption data were based upon the National Dietary Survey of Adults (NDSA) 1983; the same data from which the hypothetical diets are derived. The distribution of estimated 24 -hour intakes was adjusted to represent usual intakes. Mean intakes of all residues were about one third those reported previously.

40|$|Fish {{consumption}} {{is known to}} have several health benefits for humans. However, the accumulation of organic pollutants, like organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) could pose health hazards. Thus, OCPs in edible fish species (Oreochromis niloticus, Tilapia zillii, Carassius spp., and Clarias gariepinus) from Lake Ziway, an Ethiopian Rift Valley Lake were investigated to assess the potential human health hazards of these contaminants. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), chlordanes, and heptachlors were observed with Sigma OCPs concentration ranging from 1. 41 to 63. 8 ng g(- 1) ww. DDTs were the predominant contaminants (0. 9 to 61. 9 ng g(- 1) ww), followed by HCHs. The predominance of DDTs may be attributed to their current use in vector control and contamination from past usage. The estimated <b>daily</b> <b>intakes</b> (EDIs) of OCPs from all fish species were much lower than the <b>acceptable</b> <b>daily</b> <b>intakes</b> (ADIs), indicating that consumption of fish is at little risk to human health at present. However, the cancer risk estimates in the area of concern and the hazard ratios (HRs) of HCHs, DDTs, and heptachlors exceeded the threshold value of one, indicating daily exposure to these compounds is a potential concern. This may result in a lifetime cancer risk greater than of I in 10 (6). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this study, the {{occurrence}} of organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) and metabolite residues was investigated in 167 samples of Greek virgin olive oil during a two-year (2004 – 2005) sampling campaign. A total of 30. 5 % of samples contained detectable residues while only one sample contained dimethoate residues higher than the maximum residue limits. Among the seven detected OPs, fenthion and fenthion sulfoxide residues were detected in 10. 8 % and 14. 4 % of the samples respectively at 0. 003 to 0. 61 mg kg- 1 followed by dimethoate that was detected in 10. 2 % of the samples, at 0. 003 to 0. 057 mg kg- 1. The acute dietary risk assessment was evaluated by determining the National Estimated Short-Term Intake (NESTI) while for the chronic dietary risk assessment the National Theoretical Maximum <b>Daily</b> <b>Intake</b> (NTMDI) and National Estimated <b>Daily</b> <b>Intake</b> (NEDI) were calculated.
