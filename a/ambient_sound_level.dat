Dugan licensed the system to Altec who released several automixer models including the 1674A, -B and -C series and the 1684A, all focusing on speech applications.

To provide a low sound level experiment, a sparse scanning method was used, characterized by long, 9 sec, periods of scanner silence interspersed with 1 sec echoplanar imaging (EPI) bursts. For the condition with high sound levels, extra EPI gradient modules were inserted in the 9 sec inter-image intervals.

In this report results are presented of measurements of the level and spectral composition of natural ambient sound. The statistical L- 95 level was determined, i. e., the sound pressure level which is exceeded for 95 % of the time, at various wind velocities in open agricultural grassland. The total L- 95 is described by L- 95 = 37. 9 log(upsilon) + 42. 5, where upsilon is the wind velocity. The standard deviation {{with respect to the}} data points is 2. 4 dB.

This chapter provides information on the existing noise environment, impacts associated {{with the development of}} the Project, impacts upon the Project site, and mitigation measures to ensure compliance with State and local criteria. 13. 1. 1 Characteristics of Environmental Noise Sound is mechanical energy transmitted by pressure waves in a compressible medium such as air. Noise can be defined as unwanted sound. Sound is characterized by various parameters that include the rate of oscillation of sound waves (frequency), the speed of propagation, and the pressure level or energy content (amplitude). In particular, the sound pressure level is the most common descriptor used to characterize the loudness of an <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level.</b> The decibel (dB) scale is used to quantify sound intensity. Because sound pressure can vary enormously within the range of human hearing, a logarithmic loudness scale is used to keep sound intensity numbers at a convenient and manageable level. The human ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies in the entire spectrum, so noise measurements are weighted more heavily for frequencies to which humans are sensitive in a process called A-weighting, which is written “dBA. ” In general, human sound perception is such that a change in sound level of 3 dB is just noticeable; a change of 5 dB is clearly noticeable; and a change of 10 dB is perceived as doubling or halving sound level...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine coregulation between mothers and preterm infants in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system activity, as {{indicated}} by salivary cortisol levels, while mothers held their infants. The research questions were (a) does mother–infant coregulation in HPA activity occur during holding? and (b) if mother– infant coregulation in HPA activity exists during holding, do type of holding, antenatal steroids, sound level, and maternal touch influence this coregula-tion? Sample: The sample consisted of 20 mother– infant dyads with infants at a mean postconceptional age of 34. 7 weeks (+ 0. 7) and average postnatal age of 15 days (+ 9) at the time of cortisol sampling. Design: The design was exploratory using conveni-ence sampling. Maternal and infant cortisol levels were obtained at Time 1 (baseline) and Time 2 (end of holding); at each time, the absolute differences in levels between mother and infant were determined. Coregulation was operationalized as less difference between maternal-infant cortisol levels immediately after holding (Time 2) as compared to before hold-ing (Time 1). Results: The two variables with the highest correlation with the Time 1 /Time 2 differ-ence score included antenatal steroids and <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level,</b> which were entered into a linear regres-sion equation as predictor variables. A coregulatory relationship in cortisol levels existed between mothers and infants during holding, which was moderated by sound levels.

The audibility of wind turbine sound {{is influenced by}} ambient sound. This thesis deals with some aspects of noise from wind turbines. Ambient sounds influence the audibility of wind turbine noise. Models for assessing two commonly occurring natural ambient sounds namely vegetation sound and sound from breaking waves are presented in paper A and B. A sound propagation algorithm {{has been compared to}} long range measurementsof sound propagation in paper C. Psycho-acoustic tests evaluating the threshold and partial loudness of wind turbine noise when mixed with natural ambient sounds have been performed. These are accounted for in paper D. The main scientific contributions are the following. Paper A: A semi-empiric prediction model for vegetation sound is proposed. This model uses up-to-date simulations of wind profiles and turbulent wind fields to estimate sound from vegetation. The fluctuations due to turbulence are satisfactory estimated by the model. Predictions of vegetation sound also show good agreement to measured spectra. Paper B: A set of measurements of air-borne sound from breaking waves are reported. From these measurements a prediction method of sound from breaking waves is proposed. Third octave spectra from breaking waves are shown to depend on breaker type. Satisfactory agreement between predictions and measurements has been achieved. Paper C: Long range sound propagation over a sea surface was investigated. Measurements of sound transmission were coordinated with local meteorological measurements. A sound propagation algorithm has been compared to the measured sound transmission. Satisfactory agreement between measurements and predictions were achieved when turbulence were taken into consideration in the computations. Paper D: The paper investigates the interaction between wind turbine noise and natural ambient noise. Two loudness models overestimate the masking from two psychoacoustic tests. The wind turbine noise is completely concealed when the <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> (A-weighed) is around 10 dB higher than the wind turbine noise level.

The purpose of this analysis was to review the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center’s compliance with applicable and recognized fire and building codes with regards to its fire protection systems and features. The fire protection systems and features analyzed in this report include: 1) Egress Systems, 2) Structural Fire Protection, 3) Fire Detection and Alarm Systems, 4) Fire Suppression Systems. Prescriptive analysis of the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center was performed {{in order to determine}} if the building adhered to standards set forth within applicable standards and codes. Analysis was based primarily upon both the International Building Code 2009 Edition and NFPA 101 : Life Safety Code 2012 Edition. Where required, other NFPA codes and standards were utilized, including the 2010 Editions of NFPA 13 : Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems and NFPA 72 : National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code. The egress systems in the building largely met prescriptive code requirements except for a few issues related to room 104 and its change in occupancy use (door swing direction, locks without panic hardware, etc). The structural system is a Type II-B classification and was found to meet prescriptive code requirements. Some shortcomings with the detection and alarm systems were discovered during the analysis, mainly with respect to spacing gaps. Several visible notification devices on the second floor did not meet prescriptive code due to gaps in required coverage. Additionally, it was determined that detailed measurements of the average <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> should be taken in order to better analyze the audible notification systems. Lastly, the sprinkler system was found to meet prescriptive code requirements, both for water demand and bracing. Performance based design analysis was performed in order to gain understanding on the ability of the building to safely egress occupants during various fire scenarios when built to the prescriptive approaches set forth in the codes and standards. This performance based design analysis was based upon standards set forth in Chapter 5 of the Life Safety Code. Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and Pathfinder computer simulators were utilized to carry out the performance based design.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} recruited 24 premature infants born {{less than}} 32 weeks gestational age over a one year time period from October 2010 to 2011. The goals were to longitudinally measure cerebral oxygen saturation, evaluate how environmental variables controlled by nursing, positioning and noise, affect cerebral oxygen saturations, {{and examine the}} relationship between cerebral oxygen saturation and two currently measured vital signs. Using mixed general linear models, findings from this dissertation showed the developmental trajectory of cerebral oxygen saturation values in premature infants' began in the high 70 s during the first two days of life and then significantly decreased into the mid- 60 s over several weeks during hospitalization in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The trajectory of cerebral oxygen saturation {{during the first week of}} life in those infants who developed an IVH did not significantly differ from those infants without IVH. At this time, use of cerebral oxygen saturation to identify those infants at risk for IVH during the first week of life cannot be supported, but findings may indicate that cerebral oxygen saturation monitoring could potentially monitor the severity of the impact of IVH later during hospitalization as those infants with an IVH had significantly lower cerebral oxygen saturation values after the third week of life. In this case, cerebral oxygen saturation might help to understand the long-term degree of neurological damage. Heart rate and peripheral oxygenation were chosen as the two physiologic variables to compare to cerebral oxygen saturation and average cerebral oxygen saturation was lower with higher heart rate and higher with higher peripheral oxygenation. Peripheral oxygenation that is already routinely measured in premature infants appears to not provide an accurate measure of the changes in cerebral oxygen saturation. Cerebral oxygen saturation monitoring is highly suggested for those infants who are at risk for neurological damage such as infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy or seizures since peripheral oxygenation does not appear to be an appropriate proxy for cerebral oxygenation. Finally, sound and positioning were chosen to represent two frequently encountered components of the neonatal intensive care environment that also influence infant cerebral oxygen saturation. A peak in sound from the <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> was only 5 decibels and found to not significantly affect cerebral oxygen saturation values. A neutral position considered the gold standard [...] supine, head midline [...] was compared to five other positions widely used by NICU nurses. However, results showed positions with a turned head did not significantly change cerebral oxygen saturation from the neutral position. Yet, differences in cerebral oxygen saturation were found between two lateral positions (left lateral and right lateral, head elevated 15 °) with an elevated head measuring lower cerebral oxygen saturation levels.

It {{has long been known}} that these surface processes generate sound in the ocean, but the development of accurate algorithms has been complicated by the difficulty in obtaining location independent <b>sound</b> <b>levels.</b> Here, absolute source level estimates are achieved by modelling the sources as an infinite field of dipoles at the surface, and accounting for acoustic absorption and reflection from the ocean floor. It is shown that bottom reflections are an important component in elevating <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> at frequencies below 35 kHz. Knowing absolute source <b>levels,</b> these <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> can be used to estimate both wind speed and detect the occurrence of precipitation. It is shown that the wind-only generated <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> spectrum has a mean slope of - 18 dB/decade and ranges from - 16 to - 20 dB/decade corresponding to wind speeds from 0 to 20 ms⁻¹ for frequencies from 1 to 10 kHz.

Existing estimation algorithms are shown to overestimate the speed for wind speeds below 10 ms⁻¹ but underestimate wind speeds above 10 ms⁻¹ {{and that there is a}} maximum <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> which limits wind speed estimation for frequencies above 10 kHz.

Through the increase in anthropogenic noise in the oceans, the ambient noise level is rising. Low frequent sound can propagate over large distances and is therefore omnipresent. This {{is the cause of}} the concern that humans pollute the oceans not only with plastic and rubbish but pollute with oceanic sound emissions as well. This has, to a large extent unknown consequences for marine life. There are several anthropogenic noise sources that contribute to the increase of the <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level.</b> The shipping industry together with seismic explorations are two of those that have the largest impact. Seismic explorations have excessive noise levels, but relative to ships, they are rare. Ships on the other hand yield lower noise levels, but are outnumbering the seismic explorations. The emitted noise can harm, disturb and confuse marine life. The literature is more focused on marine mammals, such as wales. However, fish are also affected. This study focuses on analysis of ship noise. DNV-GL has put forward a standard related to ship noise with specific noise levels that are acceptable for different kinds of ships in different conditions. Ecoxy in collaboration with Jens Hovem have developed a measurement procedure and EcoNoise, a computer program that enables processing of the recorded files with a given structure following a procedure according to this standard. Data from several field trials of measuring fishing vessels conducted by Ecoxy AS were made available for this thesis. The acoustic data which has been processed as part of this thesis stems from these measurements. EcoNoise, the computer program, has been the basis of the data analysis which will be presented in this thesis. The functions have been changed to find the wanted metrics used for analysis. Different components of the acoustic emissions have been studied, such as the audible range of the noise for fish radiated from the ships as well as suggesting a possible procedure to measure the directivity of the vessels. A graphical user interface has also been developed for EcoNoise as a part of this thesis. The interface combines all the functionality of EcoNoise in an interface which is easy to use. This has been done to make the program more user friendly and make it more available for people without too much programming knowledge. This is important to enable for example the fishermen themselves to use the program while at sea. Vibration measurements of the hull of the ferry MF Glutra have been performed. This was done as preparation for measuring the vibration of the hull of one of the fishing vessels, but these measurements were not done due to the ship's schedule. Through established formulae for calculating vibration, the vibration in plates with different characteristics was calculated. Through these simulations, {{it was found that the}} plates have resonance frequencies in the audible range for fish, and will therefore have an impact on fish...|$|E
40|$|Senior thesis {{written for}} Oceanography 445 [author abstract] Increasing human {{population}} is adding anthropogenic sources of noise to natural <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> and threatening marine ecosystem function and viability. Overwater bridges, {{features of the}} Seattle urban environment, are a potential conductor of traffic noise to the underwater environment potentially complicating the underwater soundscape. This study utilized both custom and commercially built piezo-element hydrophones to sample sound underwater. The accuracy of hydrophones was analyzed comparatively in a test pool, finding that each hydrophone responded within 10 decibels of one another. The hydrophones were also used to sample ten stations along a transect of the urban waterfront between the University of Washington and Shilshole Marina, including a station directly beneath the Interstate- 5 (I- 5) Bridge. All stations showed uniform idealized sound signatures regardless of their distance from the I- 5 Bridge, suggesting that bridge noise is not a unique signature in the Seattle urban waterfront.

This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between ocean <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> <b>levels,</b> wind speed and rain. It {{has long been known}} that these surface processes generate sound in the ocean, but the development of accurate algorithms has been complicated by the difficulty in obtaining location independent <b>sound</b> <b>levels.</b> Here, absolute source level estimates are achieved by modelling the sources as an infinite field of dipoles at the surface, and accounting for acoustic absorption and reflection from the ocean floor. It is shown that bottom reflections are an important component in elevating <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> at frequencies below 35 kHz. Knowing absolute source <b>levels,</b> these <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> can be used to estimate both wind speed and detect the occurrence of precipitation. It is shown that the wind-only generated <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> spectrum has a mean slope of - 18 dB/decade and ranges from - 16 to - 20 dB/decade corresponding to wind speeds from 0 to 20 ms- 1 for frequencies from 1 to 10 kHz. The spectral slope at frequencies greater than 10 kHz depends upon wind speed. Existing estimation algorithms are shown to overestimate the speed for wind speeds below 10 ms- 1 but underestimate wind speeds above 10 ms- 1 {{and that there is a}} maximum <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> which limits wind speed estimation for frequencies above 10 kHz. A wind speed dependent correction for the existing algorithms is proposed which gives accuracies ± 1. 3 - 2 ms - 1 depending on deployment characteristics and sampling parameters. The accuracy of precipitation identification is limited by the wind speed and the precipitation type. Precipitation classified as Rain by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is detectable via acoustic means.

40|$|The {{effect of}} boat noise on the {{behaviour}} of bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus {{was investigated in}} the Egadi Islands, Sicily, during spring 2005 using a fixed tuna trap set near shipping routes. Tuna behaviour was observed when exposed to both natural <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> and sound generated by hydrofoil passenger ferries, small boats and large car ferries. Acoustical and behavioural analyses were conducted with and without extraneous sound to define a list of behavioural categories. Each vessel produced different engine sounds {{with regard to their}} composition and bandwidth, and all were distinctly different from <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> <b>levels.</b> In the absence of boat noise, tuna assumed a concentrated coordinated school structure with unidirectional swimming and without a precise shape. When a car ferry approached, tuna changed swimming direction and increased their vertical movement toward surface or bottom; the school exhibited an unconcentrated structure and uncoordinated swimming behaviour. Hydrofoils appeared to elicit a similar response, but for shorter periods. Agonistic behaviour was more evident when exposed to sounds from outboard motors of small boats. This study showed that local noise pollution generated by boats produced behavioural deviations in tuna schools. Schooling enhances tuna homing accuracy during their spawning migration, and an alteration in schooling behaviour can affect the accuracy of their migration to spawning and feeding grounds...|$|R
50|$|As {{with any}} freeway, ambient noise in {{surrounding}} neighborhoods increased, from a steadily annoying whisper of sound {{day and night}} to a dull roar that muted backyard conversations. Property values, however, did not diminish; {{it is possible that}} the improved commute and access to the vast California freeway network improved the desirability of these neighborhoods. The noise level, however, has continued to be an issue with some residents, particularly in Saratoga. Caltrans has floated several options from repaving with asphalt, to grinding down the current concrete surface of the highway. An experimental length of the freeway from Cox Avenue to De Anza Boulevard was ground down in 2003. This smoothed out much of the top layer of the freeway removing most of the rain grooves that had been cut in the concrete when the highway was first built. The result did lower the <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> along that stretch of the freeway, and subsequently, the entire concrete surfaced section of the freeway from Almaden Expressway to Stevens Creek Boulevard was microgrooved in a follow-up project in 2005.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a prediction method for {{the contribution of}} the main onboard machinery to the underwater acoustic signature of steel surface vessels that can be used during the design stage. There are two reasons for the development of this method. Firstly, a small acoustic signature is important for naval and research vessels, due to operational requirements concerning detection and interference with acoustic equipment. Furthermore, anthropogenic noise underwater is an issue that receives increasing attention from the international community. This is due to the increase of underwater <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> over the last decades and concerns about the impact on marine life. The method uses Statistical Energy Analysis to model the vibration levels on the hull, using a simplified representation of the vessel. These levels are converted into the source level of the vessel using the radiation efficiency. The method is validated with measurements. The simplification of the vessel is shown to perform well, compared to a complete model for the underwater acoustic signature. The output of the method shows resemblance to measurement values for frequencies of 200 Hz and up, but further validation is necessary to incorporate the method in the design process.
