25|$|Many {{groups and}} leaders, {{including}} prominent Protestant ministers such as Reinhold Niebuhr in Detroit, {{spoke out against}} the Klan, gaining national attention.

500|$|As of December 2013, Oppong is a {{full-time}} student at the University of Windsor teacher's college. Prior to 2013, he notified the Oshawa Power front office about his plans {{to pursue a career}} in education, leading to his trade to the Windsor Express. In the case that Windsor had to play out of their division, his basketball career forced him to miss a few days of school. Oppong has experience as a student-teacher <b>at</b> <b>Catholic</b> Central High School in Windsor, Ontario. In late 2013, he said, [...] "It's been challenging. It's a matter of juggling things and time management. I'm really grateful the Windsor Express have worked with me and supported me." [...] Express head coach Bill Jones commented, [...] "I really like Papa and respect what he's doing. I wish we could have the kid with us every day because I'm sure he'd have a bigger role with us but he's doing what he can and playing 22 minutes a game and playing them hard." [...] Oppong became the third member of his family to attend the University of Windsor, following his sister. He plans to become either a physical education or history teacher once he gets his teaching certificate. While at Eastern Kentucky University, he intentionally majored in general studies so that he could attend teacher's college for one year.|$|E
500|$|After his {{selection}} {{as a vice}} presidential candidate, Biden was criticized by his own Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington Bishop Michael Saltarelli over his stance on abortion, which goes against the church's pro-life beliefs and teachings. [...] The diocese confirmed that even if elected vice president, Biden {{would not be allowed}} to speak <b>at</b> <b>Catholic</b> schools. [...] Biden was soon barred from receiving Holy Communion by the bishop of his original hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, because of his support for abortion rights; however, Biden did continue to receive Communion at his local Delaware parish. [...] Scranton became a flash point in the competition for swing state Catholic voters between the Democratic campaign and liberal Catholic groups, who stressed that other social issues should be considered as much or more than abortion, and many bishops and conservative Catholics, who maintained abortion was paramount. Biden said he believed that life began at conception but that he would not impose his personal religious views on others. Bishop Saltarelli had previously stated regarding stances similar to Biden's: [...] "No one today would accept this statement from any public servant: 'I am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena.' Likewise, none of us should accept this statement from any public servant: 'I am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena.'" ...|$|E
