40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. The Yukon-Tanana uplands {{north and east}} of Fairbanks appear, on ERTS- 1 imagery, to be composed {{of a number of}} large-scale (approximately 100 kilometers square) crustal blocks. The boundaries of these blocks appear to be defined by a number of northeast-striking lineaments which form the major river valleys of the <b>area.</b> <b>Principal</b> among these are the valleys of the Salcha River, the Cehan River, and the Chatanika River. These lineaments are all seismically active, and are thus presumed to be faults. This parallel set of lineaments appears to be intersected at various angles by a secondary set of faults trending generally north to south. The larger earthquakes in the area occur at the intersections of the two sets. It appears that seismicity of this part of Alaska may be conceptually represented by the grinding together of rigid blocks, with earthquakes occurring along their common boundaries and at the intersections where three or more blocks come in contact...|$|E
40|$|Social media offers {{numerous}} {{opportunities to}} companies, organizations {{and government agencies}} to communicate with people outside their organization, to promote their interests and to better serve their customers, or {{as in the case}} with government agencies, to better serve their citizens. However, little is known about how police departments in particular use social media. This research study explores why police departments use social media, how they manage their social media tools, and the problems and challenges experienced as they use social media. This qualitative study is largely guided by grounded theory. The data were collected from a study population using local police departments in the Dallas-Fort worth (DFW) <b>area</b> <b>principal</b> cities using both individual interviews with police departments’ social media officers and observations of these departments’ online social media tools (in particular, Facebook and Twitter).

There are some success factors to adopting and using these tools, such as the motivation of department staff and their benefits, successful implementation of the tools, the simplicity of using tools and that it is absolutely free...|$|E

40|$|The {{discontinuities}} of {{the rock}} mass pose a high impact on its response to the static load and make complexity in modeling in such <b>area.</b> <b>Principal</b> objective {{of this study is}} to analyze the stability and sensitivity of Golab transfer tunnel access (transfer water from Zayanderud River to Kashan). This tunnel with a length of 5. 1 kilometers and inclination of 13. 5 percent is located 120 kilometers from Isfahan city. Geologically, this zone is in the range of sediment structure of Sanandaj-Sirjan. The host rock mass consists of Limestone Mesozoic (Cretaceous). The general characteristics of the joints in the rock represent high distance, low persistence, low opening (2 - 3 mm), average roughness and low weathering. Given purpose of the project and the distinct element method is the most useful for modeling rock mass for static analysis. This paper examines the effect of pa-rametric factors on the stability of tunnels via UDEC software, discrete element and empirical me-thod.

40|$|Spectral {{transformation}} methods, including {{correlation coefficient}} (CC) and Optimum Index Factor (OIF), band ratio (BR) and {{principal component analysis}} (PCA) were applied to ASTER and Landsat TM bands for lithological mapping of Soghan ophiolitic complex in south of Iran. The {{results indicated that the}} methods used evidently showed superior outputs for detecting lithological units in ophiolitic complexes. CC and OIF methods were used to establish enhanced Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color combination bands for discriminating lithological units. A specialized band ratio (4 / 1, 4 / 5, 4 / 7 in RGB) was developed using ASTER bands to differentiate lithological units in ophiolitic complexes. The band ratio effectively detected serpentinite dunite as host rock of chromite ore deposits from surrounding lithological units in the study <b>area.</b> <b>Principal</b> component images derived from first three bands of ASTER and Landsat TM produced well results for lithological mapping applications. ASTER bands contain improved spectral characteristics and higher spatial resolution for detecting serpentinite dunite in ophiolitic complexes. The developed approach used in this study offers great potential for lithological mapping using ASTER and Landsat TM bands, which contributes in economic geology for prospecting chromite ore deposits associated with ophiolitic complexes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMagnetic {{resonance}} (MR) diffusion imaging {{provides a}} valuable tool used for inferring structural anisotropy of brain white matter connectivity from diffusion tensor imaging. Recently, several high angular resolution diffusion models were introduced in order to overcome the inadequacy of the tensor model for describing fibre crossing within a single voxel. Among them, q-ball imaging (QBI), inherited from the q-space method, relies on a spherical Radon transform providing a direct relationship between the diffusion-weighted MR signal and the orientation distribution function (ODF). Experimental validation of these methods in a model system is necessary to determine {{the accuracy of the}} methods and to optimize them. A diffusion phantom made up of two textile rayon fibre (comparable in diameter to axons) bundles, crossing at 90 degrees, was designed and dedicated to ex vivo q-ball validation on a clinical scanner. Normalized ODFs were calculated inside regions of interest corresponding to monomodal and bimodal configurations of underlying structures. Three-dimensional renderings of ODFs revealed monomodal shapes for voxels containing single-fibre population and bimodal patterns for voxels located within the crossing <b>area.</b> <b>Principal</b> orientations were estimated from ODFs and were compared with a priori structural fibre directions, validating efficiency of QBI for depicting fibre crossing. In the homogeneous regions, QBI detected the fibre angle with an accuracy of 19 degrees and in the fibre-crossing region with an accuracy of 30 degrees...|$|E
