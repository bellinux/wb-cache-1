5|$|Epacris impressa regenerates after bushfire by {{seed and}} resprouting. Fieldwork in {{heathland}} in the Otway Ranges {{in the years}} following the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires showed that large numbers of E. impressa seedlings appeared in some areas, and that flowering took place as early as the second year <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
5|$|Immediately <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> Shea and his ASPO {{colleagues at}} Houston boarded a NASA plane to the Kennedy Space Center. They landed at about 1:00a.m., only five hours <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> had broken out. At {{a meeting that}} morning with Robert Gilruth, George Mueller and George Low, Shea helped to {{determine}} the individuals who {{would be on the}} NASA review board looking into the causes of the fire. Additionally, he persuaded George Mueller, head of NASA's Office of Manned Space Flight, to allow him to act as Mueller's deputy in Florida, supervising the progress of the investigation.|$|E

5|$|Shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> the {{government}} of Madagascar established the Direction nationale des opérations Rova (DNOR, or National Office of Rova Operations), a body directed by four national experts within Madagascar's Ministry of Culture who were tasked with developing and overseeing plans for {{the reconstruction of the}} Rova. Two years <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> several key milestones in the process had been achieved, with objects recovered from the fire inventoried, site excavations completed, preliminary restoration plans for Manjakamiadana developed, and work on the royal chapel initiated. A ramp was also built to enable site access for the necessary heavy construction vehicles. Prior to work commencing, a traditional ceremony was performed to restore the sanctity of the site, which had served a dual role as both a physical tomb and spiritual link to venerated ancestors.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> in 1938, the {{pavilion}} {{was replaced with}} a 1,564 seat theatre which has since hosted a number of acts including; Frankie Vaughan, Frank Randle, Tessie O'Shea, Dave Morris, Bernard Delfont, Morecambe and Wise, Paul Daniels, Freddie Starr, Russ Abbot, Bruce Forsyth, Des O'Connor, Joe Longthorne, Lily Savage, Brian Conley and Hale and Pace.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> of St. Germain-des-Prés in 1793 only 12 {{leaves were}} found, {{the other two}} have been {{transferred}} to Saint Petersburg. From 1795 until the present it has been held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Fragmenta Mosquensia were brought to Moscow in 1665. They were examined by Matthaei. The last was Porphyrius Uspensky, who took one leaf from the monastery.|$|E

5|$|At the {{northeast}} corner of Cross and River Streets stands the Thompson Block, a historic building which was used as barracks in the Civil War. The Thompson Block suffered a bad fire early in the morning on September 23, 2009, and the temporary supports reaching into adjacent streets, installed shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> to stabilize the structure, blocked westbound traffic on Cross Street for more than three months and have resulted in legal tussles between the city and the property owner.|$|E
5|$|By 1720, Vanbrugh's direct {{connection}} with the theatre had been terminated, but the leases and rents had been transferred to both his own family {{and that of his}} wife's through a series of trusts and benefices, with Vanbrugh himself building a new home in Greenwich. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> the Vanbrugh family's long association with the theatre was terminated, and all their leases were surrendered by 1792.|$|E
5|$|In Beijing, {{authorities}} halted renovation projects {{similar to}} the one being done on the apartment in Shanghai shortly after the blaze. The projects, intended to save energy by installing insulation, were stopped on 19 November, pending safety evaluations of the work. The insulation is still flammable, despite the use of fire retardants. Shanghai officials temporarily stopped such renovations <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> but later allowed them to resume.|$|E

5|$|Lawsuits {{on behalf}} of sixteen people and {{businesses}} claiming losses {{as a result of}} the blaze were filed shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> in 1991. In February 1995 a $15 million agreement was reached to reimburse workers and businesses affected by the fire. While not admitting any liability, the $15 million minus legal fees was paid by E/R Partners and was meant for uninsured losses for businesses and workers in One Meridian and the surrounding damaged buildings.|$|E
5|$|Other {{artefacts}} in {{the cathedral}} include tapestries in the Chapel of Remembrance from 1976 which record important events {{in the cathedral}}'s history. The ornate pulpit (1710), the largest in Sweden, was designed by Nicodemus Tessin and carved by Burchard Precht. It {{was a gift from}} Queen Hedvig Eleonora <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> of 1702. Decorations include John the Baptist preaching in the desert, Saint Paul in Athens and the parable of the Labourers in the Vineyard.|$|E
5|$|Pub – The White Horse in {{the village}} centre is a popular pub across the island. It {{suffered}} a fire in 1987, then again 20 years later in 2007 which saw its temporary closure. Prior to the two fires, the pub was thatched, however <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> in 2007, a tiled roof was built, {{in an attempt to}} prevent future fires.|$|E
500|$|Aspen {{became more}} {{widespread}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires,</b> occupying areas {{that had been}} dominated by conifers. It had long been believed that aspen regenerated by sprouting from existing roots rather than by seed dispersal. However, aspen sprouts appeared two years <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> as far as [...] from the nearest known aspen trees. Aspen is a preferred grazing food for elk {{and many of the}} newer aspen are consequently small, except in areas that are harder for elk to get to. The resurgence of aspen <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> was a contrast to pre-fire events, as aspen had been increasingly scarce in the park. This might be a temporary event as conifers continue to grow and eventually crowd out other tree species.|$|R

5|$|The {{low level}} station {{remained}} open, although passenger numbers at that station also fell <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> of 1936 and many services were diverted to serve London–Croydon routes {{instead of the}} Victoria–London Bridge route. Rail travel was in decline across the UK in the 1960s and 1970s when the Beeching Axe was imposed. During the 1970s, two outer platforms used by terminating trains were abandoned and the third rail was removed.|$|E
5|$|The new {{island was}} named <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> jötunn Surtur from Norse mythology (Surts is the genitive case of Surtur, plus , island). Three French journalists {{representing}} the magazine Paris Match notably landed there on 6 December 1963, staying for about 15minutes before violent explosions {{encouraged them to}} leave. The journalists jokingly claimed French sovereignty over the island, but Iceland quickly asserted that the new island belonged to it.|$|E
5|$|The {{site of the}} burned-out capitol {{building}} remained a pile of stones for several years <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> A downtown building, Nesmith's Building (later named the Holman Building), served as a temporary capitol from 1859 until 1876. The legislature met on {{the second and third}} floors of that building, which also housed the other state offices.|$|E

5|$|The western wing is {{dominated}} by a square tower of stone-dressed brick which rises two storeys above the roof and is capped by an ogee spirelet surrounded by four corner chimneys. Designed by Barry in the High Victorian style, it was added <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> A slender bell tower also rises from the west wing. At the rear is a loggia with a vaulted ceiling supported by Tuscan columns. The western end of this wing is a single-storey extension by Thomas Bower dating from 1896.|$|E
5|$|According to the Board, Grissom {{suffered}} severe third degree {{burns on}} over one-third {{of his body}} and his spacesuit was mostly destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on almost half of his body and a quarter of his spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over {{almost a quarter of}} his body and a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged. The autopsy report confirmed that the primary cause of death for all three astronauts was cardiac arrest caused by high concentrations of carbon monoxide. Burns suffered by the crew were not believed to be major factors, and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem. Asphyxiation happened <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> melted the astronauts' suits and oxygen tubes, exposing them to the lethal atmosphere of the cabin.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Hipper {{left the}} Norwegian theater in September 1940 for an {{overhaul}} in Wilhelmshaven. After the routine maintenance was completed {{toward the end}} of the month, the ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic Ocean to raid merchant traffic. The engine oil feed system caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew to shut down the ship's propulsion system until the blaze could be brought under control; this rendered Admiral Hipper motionless for several hours on the open sea. British reconnaissance failed to locate the ship, and <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> was extinguished, the ship returned to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.|$|E
