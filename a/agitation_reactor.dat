30|$|As it {{has been}} {{pointed out in the}} recent article of Gardossi et al. (2010), in which {{guidelines}} for the reporting of biocatalytic reactions are given, ideally specific activity values (mol of substrate converted or product produced per time unit and per amount of enzyme) should be given when enzymatic activity is reported. However, to do so for CLEAs, and for comparing the obtained value with the specific activity of the ensuing native enzyme, several conditions should be met. In the first place, for both free enzyme and CLEAs enzymatic activity should be measured within linear ranges of activity-enzyme amount/concentration that guarantee constant specific activity. Besides, the amount of protein present in the commercial enzyme solution used, and in the produced CLEAs must be known. Finally, the same reaction time and experimental conditions must be used in both assays, which implies that temperature, pH, substrate concentrations, <b>agitation,</b> reaction volume, <b>reactor</b> configuration, etc., need to be the same when native enzyme and CLEAs are assayed. In the following paragraphs a method for accurate determination of the recovered enzymatic activity of CLEAs that includes all the mentioned requirements is proposed for the first time. The methodology described is exemplified with the quantification of the recovered activity of CLEAs of Thermomyces lanuginosa lipase (TLL) by use of triolein hydrolysis as the reaction test. The approach can be easily extended to other reactions.|$|R
40|$|Biorefining of {{lignocellulosic}} biomass into biofuels {{and chemicals}} can help replace fossil resources and decrease anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This thesis {{is focused on}} the effects of mixing on the enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated biomass. Two different types of biomass were studied: softwood (Norway spruce and Scots pine), and the energy grass giant reed. Before enzymatic hydrolysis, the biomass was pretreated by either steam or sulfite pretreatment. The first part of the work concerns the connection between particle morphology and rheology of pretreated biomass, how such properties change during the course of enzymatic hydrolysis, and how the changes are influenced by reactor mixing. The second part examines the effects of mixing in stirred tank reactors on the enzymatic hydrolysis of different pretreated materials, and also attempts to explain the mechanisms behind the observed phenomena. The particle size reduction during enzymatic hydrolysis of steam pretreated spruce was primarily driven by <b>reactor</b> <b>agitation.</b> In the case of steam pretreated giant reed the particle size was mainly reduced by enzymatic hydrolysis. The rapid reduction in particle size of giant reed coincided with a rapid liquefaction. For steam pretreated softwood, the viscosity in fact increased at the beginning of enzymatic hydrolysis, followed by a gradual decrease during the remainder of the hydrolysis. This interesting phenomenon was in part linked to the type of pretreatment used on the softwood biomass. In contrast to steam pretreated softwood, the viscosity of sulfite pretreated spruce decreased rapidly during enzymatic hydrolysis. Efficient viscosity reduction in sulfite pretreated spruce was also achieved with very low doses of pure endoglucanase enzymes (0. 1 mg protein per g glucan) without significant glucose release. The effect of mixing on the enzymatic hydrolysis was in part determined by the viscosity of the pretreated biomass. For steam pretreated spruce at low solid loading, decreasing the agitation rate had little effect on the the enzymatic hydrolysis. However, if the viscosity was increased by the addition of a thickening agent, the effect of agitation was much larger. For a substrate that underwent rapid initial viscosity reduction, such as steam pretreated giant reed, the enzymatic hydrolysis was almost independent of agitation rate. Another important factor determining the effect of mixing on the enzymatic hydrolysis was the level of product inhibition. If the glucose and cellobiose concentrations were high, as during high solid hydrolysis of steam pretreated spruce, low agitation rate had a large negative effect on the enzymatic hydrolysis. However, if the product concentration was kept low, as during SSF, the effect of agitation was much weaker. Overall, the results indicate that the decrease in hydrolysis rate occurred due to increased local product inhibition, caused by mass transfer limitations in the stagnant zones, formed in the reactor volume when under low intensity mixing. The rate of enzymatic hydrolysis appeared to be determined by flow regime, i. e. Reynolds number, rather than specific mixing power input. This implies that the negative effects of low agitation rate will be less of a problem in larger reactors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to design and {{investigate}} a bio-pulping reactor for rice straw using Bacillus sp. PMB- 021, which was provided by the Disease Management Research Center of the Plant Pathology Department of the National Chung Hsing University, in an attempt to solve the problem of agricultrual wastes and to provide a new source of material of fiber for industries such as pulping and reproductive energy. At first, established the standard for measuring the bio-pulping efficiency of rice straw, including a 24 -hour drying time and the repulping time is 60 seconds, and also obtained the moisture content (dry basis) of the rice straw was 8. 91 %, which harvested from the agriculture experimental station of NCHU. Based on the preliminary studies on bio-pulping of rice straws by Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 at 30, 35 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60 ℃, there was no significant difference in basic bio-pulping efficiencies without shaking, while in shaking condition Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 showed the optimal efficiency at 45 ℃ with the recovery of 61. 45 %. Our results thus suggest that Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 requires a shaking condition to obtain a batter efficiency of bio-pulping for rice straw. The bio-pulping reactor in this study was composed of a tank, a stirring apparatus, a power controlling system, a temperature controlling system and other auxiliary devices. The <b>agitation</b> of this <b>reactor</b> adopted the compressing of reciprocating motion. The reciprocating motion angle experiments suggest that the reactor shows disproportionate mixing in 90 ° reciprocating motion by the over-stirring of rice straw, while 45 ° proved to be a better stirring angle of bio-pulping reactor with the recovery of 64. 70 % and the rice straws displayed proportionate mixing and was completely submerged in the reagent. Comparing the results of the experiments with or without Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 under 45 ° reciprocating motion angle process demonstrates that the bio-pulping reactor in this study is able to degrade rice straws efficiently, and that Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 could function in the bio-pulping reactor of this study. The no-stirring experiment of the bio-pulping reactor displayed the natural microorganisms inside rice straws also have the ability of bio-pulping, the potential of which needs to be further investigated in the future. Intermittent bio-pulping process studies demonstrate that the Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 would be hindered from the process without continued stirring. The reaction time of the bio-pulping process should be controlled less than 2 days to prevent hemicellulose lost. The efficiency of bio-pulping can be increased by improving the stirring apparatus and pretreat the rice straw. 摘要 本研究旨在利用國立中興大學植物病理學系病害管理研究室提供之Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 進行稻草生物製漿反應器之開發與探討，以解決稻草廢棄物處理之問題，亦由此方式提供製漿或生殖能源等工業一種新的纖維原料來源。首先本研究確立稻草分解效率判定方式，其包括稻草纖維回收率測定時所需要的乾燥時間為 24 小時，而散漿時間則以 60 秒為佳，並獲致本研究所使用之中興大學北溝農場之風乾梗稻，其乾基含水率為 8. 91 %。 依據Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 進行稻草生物製漿基礎試驗，於 30 、 35 、 40 、 45 、 50 、 55 與 60 ℃之七種不同溫階測試結果，已獲致靜置反應時，菌種添加與否並無顯著效果，然於震盪反應條件下，上述七種溫階則獲致 45 ℃為Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 之較佳反應溫度，其反應回收率為 61. 45 %，並亦獲致Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 於擾動情況下，能有效提高解離稻草纖維之效果。 本研究開發之稻草生物製漿反應器，系統包括反應槽體與攪拌機構、動力與控制系統、溫度控制系統以及其他輔助裝置，其擾動主要採取往復轉動之擠壓方式，在轉動角度之測試結果，獲致於轉動角度 90 °運轉時會造成稻草過度擠壓，導致攪拌不均之情況；當於轉動角度 45 °時，則可獲致較佳之反應現象，稻草可完全浸於反應溶液並達到均勻之攪拌效果，而其反應回收率為 64. 70 %；運轉角度 45 °試驗組與無菌對照組反應試驗結果相互比較，亦獲致Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 能有效於反應器內進行纖維解離。反應器無攪動對照組試驗中亦發現，稻草本身所內含之雜菌亦具有解離纖維之能力，有關其是否具備生物製漿之潛力則需進一步探討。而間歇運轉試驗結果則顯示若無持續擾動，將影響Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 進行稻草生物製漿之能力；且未來有關稻草生物製漿之反應時間應以兩天以內為佳，以考量保留更多之半纖維素成分，然而未來仍須解決攪拌機構容易造成攪拌不均之問題，或是透過適當之稻草前處理，來增進稻草生物製漿之效率。目錄 謝 誌	i 摘要	ii Abstract	iv 目錄	vii 圖目錄	x 表目錄	xiii 第一章 緒論	 1 1 - 1 前言	 1 1 - 2 研究目的	 3 第二章 文獻探討	 4 2 - 1 稻草	 4 2 - 1 - 1 稻的種類	 4 2 - 1 - 2 稻草結構	 5 2 - 1 - 3 稻草成分	 9 2 - 2 纖維	 12 2 - 2 - 1 纖維素	 12 2 - 2 - 2 半纖維素(hemicellulose) 	 15 2 - 2 - 3 木質素(lignin) 	 17 2 - 2 - 4 植物纖維(plant fiber) 	 18 2 - 3 製漿工業	 20 2 - 3 - 1 機械製漿(mechanical pulping) 	 21 2 - 3 - 2 化學製漿(chemical pulping) 	 24 2 - 3 - 2 - 1 	牛皮漿法(kraft process) 	 25 2 - 3 - 2 - 2 	亞硫酸法(sulfite process) 	 25 2 - 3 - 3 生物製漿(bio-pulping) 	 26 2 - 4 散漿與洗漿	 29 2 - 5 反應器	 30 2 - 5 - 1 反應器之操作方式分類	 30 2 - 5 - 2 生物反應器	 32 2 - 5 - 3 固態發酵	 36 第三章 實驗方法與設備	 41 3 - 1 實驗目的與內容	 41 3 - 2 試驗方法	 41 3 - 2 - 1 	稻草切斷處理方式	 42 3 - 2 - 2 	稻草溶液調製方式	 42 3 - 2 - 3 	散漿方式	 43 3 - 2 - 4 	沖洗過篩方式	 43 3 - 2 - 5 	乾燥物乾物秤重方式	 44 3 - 2 - 6 稻草反應回收率	 44 3 - 3 實驗設備與儀器	 45 3 - 3 - 1 量測設備與儀器	 45 3 - 3 - 2 反應器使用之儀器與材料	 52 3 - 4 試驗材料	 56 3 - 4 - 1 稻草	 56 3 - 4 - 2 菌種	 56 3 - 4 - 3 培養液	 57 3 - 5 實驗規劃與實驗流程	 58 3 - 6 稻草分解效率判定方式	 61 3 - 6 - 1 建立散漿時間試驗與結果	 61 3 - 6 - 2 建立沖洗過篩方式	 65 3 - 6 - 3 建立乾燥時間試驗與結果	 66 3 - 7 稻草生物製漿基礎試驗	 69 3 - 7 - 1 Bacillus sp.
