5|$|Blois was {{frequently}} <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> Puiset's charters, {{and was named}} as rector of a parish church {{in the city of}} Durham, appointed by Puiset. By the late 1180s, Blois had moved to the household of Hugh of Avalon, the Bishop of Lincoln. Blois was a subdean, an ecclesiastical official, of the diocese of Lincoln by 22 March 1194, probably from about 1189. He was a frequent witness to Hugh's charters in the late 1180s. Although he was now serving Hugh, Blois did not entirely quit the service of Puiset, and was present at Puiset's deathbed in 1195. He was named precentor of Lincoln in 1197, in succession to the medieval writer Walter Map. Besides Hugh and Puiset, he also served Pope Innocent III. He may be the Master William of Blois who is <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> some Scottish charters.|$|E
5|$|The Anthology of Pliny's Natural History is an {{epitome of}} Pliny the Elder's Natural History {{dedicated}} to King Henry II of England. It is of some {{importance in the}} transmission of Pliny's ideas to medieval Europe, {{although it has been}} shown to be less important as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> Pliny's text than once thought.|$|E
5|$|After King Henry's {{death in}} 1135, Basset was not {{employed}} as a royal official, either as a justice or as a sheriff. He appears once as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> a charter of King Stephen's in 1136, but the authenticity of this document has been questioned. He had built a castle in Normandy at Montreuil-au-Houlme, but Basset did not have possession of it in 1136, when it was held against Stephen's opponents by William de Montpincon.|$|E

5|$|After his consecration Warelwast {{continued}} {{to serve the}} king, often appearing on documents or in accounts of the royal court. The bishop served the king as a messenger, once more carrying messages to Anselm in 1108. He {{also served as a}} royal judge, hearing a case at Tamworth in 1114 and another at Westbourne the same year. He was with the king in Normandy in 1111, 1113, and 1118, and may have been in Normandy more frequently. During Henry's reign Warelwast was <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> 20of the king's charters.|$|E
5|$|Around 1657, Ruisdael {{moved to}} Amsterdam, by then a prosperous city which {{was likely to}} have offered a bigger market for his work. His fellow Haarlem painter Allaert van Everdingen had already moved to Amsterdam and found a market there. On June 17, 1657 he was baptized in Ankeveen, near Naarden. Ruisdael {{lived and worked in}} Amsterdam {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1668, his name appears as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> the {{marriage}} of Meindert Hobbema, his only registered pupil, a painter whose works have been confused with Ruisdael's own.|$|E
5|$|At the hospital, Mulder and Green {{interview}} <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> the bar fire, {{who tells}} {{them of the}} assailant's apparent ability to will fire into existence. The Marsdens' driver becomes even sicker due to the poisoned cough syrup provided by L'Ively. Because of his illness, L'Ively is recruited to drive the family into Boston that night to attend a party at a luxury hotel. Mulder flies up to Boston to watch over the party with Green, hoping to set a trap for the suspect; Scully continues working on compiling a criminal profile of the killer.|$|E

5|$|Griesbach {{produced}} {{a list of}} nine manuscripts which were to be assigned to the Alexandrian text: C, L, K, 1, 13, 33, 69, 106, and 118. Codex Vaticanus was not in this list. In the second (1796) edition of his Greek NT, Griesbach added Codex Vaticanus as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> the Alexandrian text in Mark, Luke, and John. He still believed {{the first half of}} Matthew represented the Western text-type.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about Leofric, as his cathedral town was not a centre of {{historical}} writing, and he took little part in events outside his diocese. Little notice was taken {{of his life and}} activities; only a few charters originated in his household and there is only one listing of gifts to his diocese. No official acts from his episcopate have survived, and there is just a brief death notice in the Leofric Missal, although no notice of his death occurs in the contemporary Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. He occurs as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> royal charters.|$|E
5|$|Most of Ælfhelm's {{subsequent}} historical appearances record him as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> charters, {{although one}} notable {{exception is the}} will of his brother, Wulfric Spot. According to a 12th-century tradition, Ælfhelm was murdered and his sons blinded in 1006, by Eadric Streona with the connivance of King (Æthelred II). Ælfhelm's daughter, Ælfgifu, married Cnut the Great, King of England between 1016 and 1035, {{as a result of}} which Ælfhelm became the grandfather of future English king Harold Harefoot.|$|E

5|$|Neville first {{appears in}} the {{historical}} record as the butler of Count Waleran of Meulan in 1138. Neville {{may have been in}} Waleran's service prior to this, {{but this is the first}} secure appearance. For serving as butler, Neville received rents from the market dues at Pont-Audemer worth 100 shillings annually. He appears as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> a charter of Waleran's to the Abbey of Tiron, which is dated sometime before 1141. Neville witnessed ten other of Waleran's charters, ending in the 1150s.|$|E
5|$|Reginald {{was granted}} the castles of Bellencombre and Mortemer in {{the charter of}} Westminster in 1153 which settled the rights that William, the {{surviving}} son of King Stephen, received for not contesting the crown of England going to Henry of Anjou after Stephen's death, and was also <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> the charter. Reginald continued {{to serve as a}} royal official, witnessing more of the new king's charters.|$|E
5|$|Robert's first {{appearance}} in the historical record is at Ramsey Abbey sometime between 1114 and 1123, where he appears as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> a charter. A further appearance is in a document of his brother Walter dating between 1130 and 1139. It is likely that Robert was a canon of York Cathedral before 1147. He is also claimed to have held the office of Provost of Beverley Minster as the immediate predecessor to Thomas Becket, but this is unlikely, as Becket did not become provost until 1154, long after Robert had become Dean of York.|$|E

5|$|Sportswriter Fuzzy Woodruff, <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> the game, wrote:Under Heisman's tutelage, Auburn {{played with}} a {{marvelous}} speed and dash that couldn't be gainsaid and which fairly swept Sewanee off its feet. Only the remarkable punting of Simkins kept the game from being a debacle. I recall vividly one incident of the game, which demonstrates clearly just how surprising was Sewanee's victory.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel is well {{established}} early on as not only <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> events, but also as someone who makes observations and offers reflection. It is he who considers slavery under Henri Christophe worse than that under French rule because blacks are now enslaving fellow blacks. It is also he who offers reflections about the difficulty of this world allowing {{for the possibility of}} greatness during the concluding remarks of the novel. His perspective represents that of the folk, including his belief in the African gods.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Æthelwold's {{immediate}} family. Æthelred was born in about 848 and died in 871, so his sons must have been young children when he died. Æthelred's wife was probably the Wulfthryth who witnessed a charter in 868. Æthelwold {{and his older brother}} Æthelhelm are first recorded in King Alfred's will in the 880s. Æthelhelm is not heard of again, and he probably died soon afterwards. The only other record of Æthelwold before Alfred's death is as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> a charter that probably dates to the 890s.|$|E

5|$|Walter {{cannot be}} traced back in Scotland with {{certainty}} before his appearance as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> a charter of Thomas, Earl of Mar, on 9 July 1358. He may have returned a year earlier, as a document dated sometime between November 1357 and April 1359 records him in the sheriffdom of Forfar (royal demesne in Angus) assisting a justice ayre. He appears again on 4 September 1359, witnessing another charter of Earl Thomas at the latter's residence of Kildrummy Castle.|$|E
5|$|By 1046 Stigand {{had begun}} to witness {{charters}} of Edward the Confessor, showing that he was once again in royal favour. In 1047 Stigand was translated to the see of Winchester, but he retained Elmham until 1052. He may have owed the preferment to Earl Godwin of Wessex, the father-in-law of King Edward, although that is disputed by some historians. Emma, who had retired to Winchester after regaining Edward's favour, may also have influenced the appointment, either alone or in concert with Godwin. After his appointment to Winchester, Stigand was <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> all the surviving charters of King Edward during the period 1047 to 1052.|$|E
5|$|By 1147, Nigel {{was again}} {{witnessing}} Stephen's charters, and in 1153 or 1154 {{he was named}} in a grant of lands to St Radegund's Priory in Cambridge. He assisted with the consecration of Hilary of Chichester as Bishop of Chichester in August 1147. He took part in shire courts in both Norfolk and Suffolk in 1150, and continued to assist with episcopal consecrations throughout the remainder of Stephen's reign. No records exist of him being involved with treasury affairs during this time. His witnessing of charters is sparse, and almost always in company with other bishops; this suggests {{that he was only}} at court for councils or other similar events. Nigel was <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> Stephen's charter that left England to Matilda's son, Henry of Anjou. When Henry succeeded Stephen, Nigel was present at the coronation.|$|E
