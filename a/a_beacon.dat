5|$|The game's ending changes {{depending}} on whether the player has a radio beacon to call for extraction, and when the nuclear device is set to explode. Forgetting to set the bomb, or setting it to explode at any time past the awakening of the dreaming god, results in Earth's destruction. The device's detonation before the player reaches a minimum safe distance results in a pyrrhic victory. The most favorable endings are achieved by leaving the pyramid with <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> for evacuation at least twenty game minutes before the device is set to go off; if the game ends with enough time for the player to escape on foot, the player survives without <b>a</b> <b>beacon.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Hanseatic League in Lübeck in 1499, they applied once more to the bishop for {{permission}} to build <b>a</b> <b>beacon.</b> On 20 April 1500 Bishop Johannes III Orgas (John Orgies) agreed to allow a massive stone pillar without any openings. To cover the building costs, Tallinn city council had to establish a special lighthouse tax until the sum was complete.|$|E

30|$|In both Figures 16 and 17, {{it can be}} {{observed}} that {{from the point of}} string stability performance, CACC strongly outperforms ACC. In particular, for <b>a</b> <b>beaconing</b> packet loss ratio of 0 % the CACC string stability overshoot and undershoot are more than 10 times smaller than those measured on the ACC system. Even for <b>a</b> <b>beaconing</b> packet loss ratio of 50 % the CACC string stability overshoot and undershoot are more than 5 times smaller than those measured on the ACC system.|$|R

5|$|In the 16th century, {{the site}} was used as <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> for the Pilgrimage of Grace. During the 18th century, the castle was of {{interest}} to treasure hunters following rumours that gold and silver had been discovered at Buckton. The site {{was used as an}} anti-aircraft decoy site in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Drax's henchman Krebs {{is caught}} by Bond {{snooping}} through his room. Later, an attempted assassination by triggering a landslide nearly kills Bond and Brand, as they swim beneath the Dover cliffs. Drax takes Brand to London, where she discovers {{the truth about}} the Moonraker by comparing her own launch trajectory figures with those in a notebook picked from Drax's pocket. She is captured by Krebs, and finds herself captive in a secret radio homing station—intended to serve as <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> for the missile's guidance system—in the heart of London. While she is being taken back to the Moonraker facility by Drax, Bond gives chase, but is also captured by Drax and Krebs.|$|E
5|$|Duncan initiates {{the player}} into the Grey Wardens through a {{dangerous}} ritual called the Joining, which involves imbibing Darkspawn blood. The recipient is either killed or imbued with the powerful darkspawn essence, the Taint, granting them {{the ability to}} sense Darkspawn and a rudimentary connection into their hive mind. Afterwards, the player and fellow Grey Warden, Alistair, are tasked with lighting <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> {{at the top of}} the fortress to signal Loghain's men into charging the horde's flank. However, upon arriving, Loghain abandons the battlefield with his army, leaving Cailan, Duncan, and their army to be overwhelmed and slain by the Darkspawn, who seize control of Ostagar and begin advancing into southern Ferelden.|$|E

50|$|Another {{application}} is an indoor positioning system, which helps smartphones determine their approximate location or context. With {{the help of}} <b>a</b> Bluetooth <b>beacon,</b> <b>a</b> smartphone's software can approximately find its relative location to <b>a</b> Bluetooth <b>Beacon</b> in <b>a</b> store. Brick and mortar retail stores use the beacons for mobile commerce, offering customers special deals through mobile marketing, and can enable mobile payments through point of sale systems.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> HAWK <b>beacon</b> (High-Intensity Activated crossWalK <b>beacon)</b> is <b>a</b> {{traffic control}} device used to stop road traffic and allow {{pedestrians}} to cross safely. It is officially known as <b>a</b> Pedestrian Hybrid <b>Beacon</b> (PHB). The purpose of <b>a</b> HAWK <b>beacon</b> {{is to allow}} protected pedestrian crossings, stopping road traffic only as needed. Where standard traffic signal 'warrants' prevent the installation of standard three-color traffic signals, the HAWK <b>beacon</b> provides <b>an</b> alternative.|$|R
5|$|During Borobudur excavation, archeologists {{discovered}} colour pigments of blue, red, green, black, {{as well as}} bits of gold foil, {{and concluded}} that the monument that we see today — a dark gray mass of volcanic stone, lacking in colour — was probably once coated with varjalepa white plaster and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> of Buddhist teaching. The same vajralepa plaster can also be found in Sari, Kalasan and Sewu temples. It is likely that the bas-reliefs of Borobudur was originally quite colourful, before centuries of torrential tropical rainfalls peeled-off the colour pigments.|$|E
5|$|Hartshead Pike is a stone tower {{on top of}} Hartshead Hill {{overlooking}} Ashton and Oldham. The current {{building was}} constructed in 1863 {{although there has been}} a building on the site since at least the mid-18th century, although the original purpose is obscure. The pike may have been the site of <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> in the late 16th century. It has a visitor centre and {{from the top of the}} hill it is possible to see the Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire, the Welsh hills, and the Holme Moss transmitter in West Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Kemp {{continued}} to be considered along with Reagan as the politician most responsible {{for the implementation of}} supply-side tax cuts and along with Steve Forbes as the political figure most responsible for their continued place in the marketplace of political ideas. He has been described as <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> of economic conservatism and a hero for his urban agenda. Today, he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal conservatives who believe that free markets and low taxes work better than government bureaucracies. Kemp was considered the leader of the progressive conservatives who adhere to the hard right on social issues, but avoid protectionist fiscal and trade policy.|$|E

50|$|In 1963, {{in order}} to help nearby Hualien Harbor become an {{international}} port, a new lighthouse, consisting of a white pentagon concrete building, was built on the original lighthouse base. The newly built Qilaibi Lighthouse used a 4th class white light electric lamp, the light flashing 3 seconds and dimming 3 seconds at a regular 6 second intervals, and the luminous intensity is 28,000 cd. In 1973, <b>a</b> non-directional <b>beacon</b> pole was added, with output power 100 watts and range 100 nms, to function in coordination with the Lyudao Lighthouse, also <b>a</b> non-directional <b>beacon</b> pole, for the ships mutual positioning. In 1985, <b>a</b> radar <b>beacon</b> pole was set. Then finally, in 1992, the communication systems were comprehensively changed into <b>a</b> dual-frequency radar <b>beacon</b> pole.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Helen visits Edna and learns what Bob {{has been}} up to. Edna {{activates}} <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> she built into the suits so Helen can find Bob, inadvertently causing him to be discovered and captured. Helen borrows a private plane to head for Nomanisan, but Violet and Dash have stowed away wearing their own suits, leaving Jack-Jack with a babysitter. Syndrome shoots down Helen's plane, but she and the children survive and reach the island. When Bob is informed that his family is dead, he grabs and threatens to kill Mirage, but relents when Syndrome calls his bluff.|$|E
5|$|The Anglican parish {{church of}} St Michael {{dates from the}} 15th century and has been {{designated}} by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building; its tower used to display <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> light for ships approaching the harbour. After being caught in a violent storm at sea, Robert Quirke dedicated a ship and its cargo to God's service, as well as donating a cellar near the quay for prayers to be offered for those at sea. Dating from 1628 and known as the Gibraltar Celler , {{it is now the}} Chapel of St Peter. Quirke also donated money from the sale of the ship and its cargo to build almshouses.|$|E
5|$|Vanellope {{participates in}} a race, but is {{attacked}} by King Candy. Vanellope's glitch reveals {{he is actually}} Turbo, who took over Sugar Rush, displacing Vanellope as the main character. Ralph, Felix, and Calhoun evacuate the game, but Vanellope cannot leave due to her glitch. When Calhoun points out the Cy-Bugs can be destroyed by <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> of light as per Hero's Duty, Ralph decides to make Diet Cola Mountain erupt to replicate it. Ralph is confronted by Turbo, now fused with a Cy-Bug that devoured him, and Turbo carries him away. Ralph breaks free, hits the mountain, and causes it to erupt, but Vanellope saves him using her glitch. The volcanic beacon destroys the Cy-Bugs and Turbo.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, We {{mathematically model}} the In-Range {{localization}} scheme {{in the presence}} of <b>a</b> Mobile <b>Beacon.</b> In the In-Range localization scheme, a sensor with unknown location is localized to a disc centered at the position of the beacon, if the sensor under consideration can successfully decode a transmission from the beacon. In our approach <b>a</b> Mobile <b>Beacon</b> guided by <b>a</b> mobility model is used to generate the virtual beacons, there by eliminating the need to deploy static beacons that are required in the classical In-Range localization scheme. For analysis, we consider <b>a</b> Mobile <b>Beacon</b> guided by the Random Way Point (RWP) mobility model with In-Range localization scheme. The main contribution of this paper consists of mathematical models for the In-Range localization parameters {{in the presence of}} <b>a</b> Mobile <b>Beacon</b> guided by the RWP mobility model...|$|R
5|$|Beginning {{in one of}} Eorzea's {{three main}} states, the player {{character}} awakes to the Echo, a power granting them {{the ability to see}} the past. The Adventurers are initially involved in both conflicts within the nations provoked by the Garlean pretense, led by the Garlean Legatus Gaius Van Baelsar, and the Beastmen's attempts to summon their Primals and their consequent hoarding of crystal supplies. Eventually, a greater threat is {{brought to the attention of}} the nations by the Sharlayan scholar Louisoix Leveilleur: another Garlean Legatus named Nael Van Darnus is using arcane magic and technology to summon Dalamud, the planet's second moon, down on Eorzea to purge the Beastmen and Primals. With the aid of Garlean defector Cid nan Garlond, the Adventurers discover that Nael has set up <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> for summoning Dalamud in the new fortress of Castrum Novum. While each nation makes individual attempts to storm the fortress, they are repelled. Faced with this, their leaders form a pact and unite the nations under the banner of the Eorzean Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Players can use {{a variety}} of weapons to fight enemies. The game {{features}} a large arsenal of weapons, from two-handed pistols to rocket launchers, and a variety of sea, land and air vehicles. Players can drive them, jump on top of them or hide in front of them while they are moving and hijack enemy vehicles, triggering a series of quick-time events. Initially, the player must acquire weapons and vehicles in the field. Early in the game, they encounter a black market supplier from whom weapons and vehicles can be purchased (with optional delivery to the player's location by helicopter). As more chaos points are gained, additional weapons, vehicles and an extraction option become available on the black market. All black-market weapons and vehicles can be upgraded in steps with weapon and vehicle components in the game world; over 2,000 parts may be acquired. Players use <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> to access the market.|$|E
5|$|Sam and {{his high}} school crush Mikaela Banes are rescued from Barricade and Frenzy by the Camaro who {{turns out to be}} Autobot scout Bumblebee, but he is mute and has to {{communicate}} through his car radio. Previously sending <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> to his fellow Autobots, Bumblebee takes Sam and Mikaela to meet the new arrivals – Optimus, Jazz, Ironhide, and Ratchet. Optimus explains the details of their situation, revealing that if Megatron gained the AllSpark he would transform Earth’s machinery into a new army and exterminate mankind. Sam, Mikaela, and the Autobots travel to Sam’s house to retrieve the glasses, but the teenagers are captured by agents of Sector Seven, a top secret government branch, led by Seymour Simmons. The Autobots stop the agents, but they call for backup, who take Sam, Mikaela, and Bumblebee into custody, while Optimus obtains the glasses, and uses them to locate the Allspark.|$|E

5|$|The Earl {{can be a}} {{grotesque}} caricature of a Victorian gentleman: a rotund figure in cape and top hat (hiding his horns), with a perpetual enormous grin and pince-nez spectacles. Although his attitude is often cheerful, he is quick to reveal his more intimidating, malicious side. The Earl has a golem named , a pink umbrella with a small, talking jack-o-lantern at its tip. It usually talks excitedly or screams, adding {{its name to the}} end of almost every sentence. Lero, used by the Earl as a Mary Poppins-type flying umbrella, is very loyal to him and guards his sword. Road often takes Lero against its will, using it as a witch's broom or an ordinary umbrella. It has been used as <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> to summon Akuma, to transport several exorcists to the Ark and to guard the Noah. Lero has a sword similar to Allen Walker's sword of exorcism, which surprises him when they clash on Noah's Ark. Despite his antipathy to the Noah Nea, the Earl grows depressed when he talks about him.|$|E
5|$|The spit {{sheltered}} the Glaven ports, Blakeney, Cley-next-the-Sea and Wiveton, {{which were}} important medieval harbours. Blakeney sent ships to help Edward I's war efforts in 1301, {{and between the}} 14th and 16th centuries {{it was the only}} Norfolk port between King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth to have customs officials. Blakeney Church has a second tower at its east end, an unusual feature in a rural parish church. It has been suggested that it acted as <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> for mariners, perhaps by aligning it with the taller west tower to guide ships into the navigable channel between the inlet's sandbanks; that this was not always successful is demonstrated by a number of wrecks in the haven, including a carvel-built wooden ship.|$|E
5|$|The inner ward {{was created}} during Richard the Lionheart's reign, when a moat was dug {{to the west}} of the {{innermost}} ward, effectively doubling the castle's size. HenryIII created the ward's east and north walls, and the ward's dimensions remain to this day. Most of Henry's work survives, and only two of the nine towers he constructed have been completely rebuilt. Between the Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers, the innermost ward's wall also serves as a curtain wall for the inner ward. The main entrance to the inner ward would have been through a gatehouse, most likely in the west wall on the site of what is now Beauchamp Tower. The inner ward's western curtain wall was rebuilt by EdwardI. The 13th-century Beauchamp Tower marks the first large-scale use of brick as a building material in Britain, since the 5th-century departure of the Romans. The Beauchamp Tower is one of 13towers that stud the curtain wall. Anti-clockwise from the south-west corner they are: Bell, Beauchamp, Devereux, Flint, Bowyer, Brick, Martin, Constable, Broad Arrow, Salt, Lanthorn, Wakefield, and the Bloody Tower. While these towers provided positions from which flanking fire could be deployed against a potential enemy, they also contained accommodation. As its name suggests, Bell Tower housed a belfry, its purpose to raise the alarm in the event of an attack. The royal bow-maker, responsible for making longbows, crossbows, catapults, and other siege and hand weapons, had a workshop in the Bowyer Tower. A turret at the top of Lanthorn Tower was used as <b>a</b> <b>beacon</b> by traffic approaching the Tower at night.|$|E
