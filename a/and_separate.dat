5|$|According to Christian theologian Gordon J. Wenham, {{the purpose}} of kashrut was to help Jews {{maintain}} a distinct <b>and</b> <b>separate</b> existence from other peoples; {{he says that the}} effect of the laws was to prevent socialization and intermarriage with non-Jews, preventing Jewish identity from being diluted. Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their distinct status as Jews.|$|E

We consider basic properties of <b>separating</b> polynomials <b>and</b> uniformly analytic <b>and</b> <b>separating</b> functions. We indicate a relation between weak polynomial topology and norm topology of a space, provided it admits a separating polynomial. We present sufficient conditions for the existence of analytic <b>and</b> uniformly <b>separating</b> functions. We investigate a composition of an uniformly analytic <b>and</b> <b>separating</b> function <b>and</b> a linear mapping. </p...|$|R

5|$|Although it {{was once}} thought to be a simple {{solution}} of molecules, the cytosol has multiple levels of organization. These include concentration gradients of small molecules such as calcium, large complexes of enzymes that act together to carry out metabolic pathways, and protein complexes such as proteasomes and carboxysomes that enclose <b>and</b> <b>separate</b> parts of the cytosol.|$|E
5|$|British {{ichthyologist}} Charles Tate Regan described Spheroides liosomus in 1909 from specimens {{collected in}} Melbourne, Hobart, Flinders Island and Port Phillip. He noted {{its lack of}} spines compared with specimens of Tetrodon hamiltonii, and hence {{argued that it was}} a distinct <b>and</b> <b>separate</b> species. Australian biologist Gilbert Whitley equated Regan's description with Fréminville's original naming and gave it the combination Spheroides glaber in 1955, and later Gastrophysus glaber in 1964.|$|E

She is woken by Dr. Silva, but finds herself secured to a chair. Dr. Silva explains to Fauxlivia {{that he wants to}} see through the end of his research, needing only one more human host for a final gestation cycle to birth the queen beetle from which the beetle species, and his cure, can be sustained. Fauxlivia feels pains in her body when Dr. Silva implies the last cycle has begun, believing herself to be the host.|$|E

5|$|For sprinting events (bar the 4 × 400m relay and {{the indoor}} 400metres), each athlete must run the race within their {{allocated}} lane {{from start to}} finish. If an athlete leaves their lane or steps on the line demarking each lane the athlete will be disqualified. Lane rules also apply for initial periods of other track races, for example, {{the beginning of the}} 800m. Similar rules apply for longer distance races when a large field of athletes is present <b>and</b> <b>separate</b> starting points are designated, with the field merging into one group shortly after the starting phase.|$|E
5|$|In early {{editions of}} the setting, The Realms shared a unified {{cosmology}} with various other campaign settings called the Great Wheel. In this way each of the Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings were linked together to form one interwoven world connected by various planes of existence. With {{the release of the}} 2001 Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, the setting was given its own distinct <b>and</b> <b>separate</b> cosmological arrangement, with unique planes not explicitly connected to those of the other settings.|$|E

5|$|In the 2000s, a phylogenetic {{analyses}} using {{nuclear and}} mitochondrial ribosomal gene sequences helped {{to clarify the}} phylogeny of Calostoma. Using the species C.cinnabarinum and C.ravenelli as representative examples, the research showed the genus evolutionarily related to the monophyletic Boletales clade, <b>and</b> <b>separate</b> from clades containing most of the gilled mushrooms, puffballs, stalked puffballs, earthstars, stinkhorns and non-bolete Gasteromycetes. Calostoma belongs to the suborder Sclerodermatineae in the Boletales order. The Boletales comprise the following genera: Boletinellus, Calostoma, Gyroporus, Phlebopus, Pisolithus, Scleroderma, and Veligaster. Calostoma {{is thought to have}} diverged evolutionarily from the other Boletales between 52–115 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Second World War, many shophouses, usually {{two stories}} with {{functional}} shops {{on the ground}} floor <b>and</b> <b>separate</b> residential spaces upstairs, were built around the old city centre. These shop-houses drew inspiration from Straits Chinese and European traditions.

During the Second World War, the Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, as well as white winter oversuits.|$|E
