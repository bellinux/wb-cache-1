5|$|Between 1772 and 1779, Espejo {{provoked}} the colonial authorities, who regarded him as responsible for several satirical and mocking posters. These posters {{were attached to}} the doors of churches and other buildings, and their <b>anonymous</b> <b>author</b> tended to attack the colonial authorities, the clergy or any other subject he deemed convenient. Although no surviving posters have been found, evidence from comments Espejo made in his writings suggests that he wrote them.|$|E
5|$|However, modern {{historians have}} {{challenged}} existing information on Taksony's early life. A nearly-contemporaneous sourceLiudprand of Cremona's Retributionnarrates that Taksony led a plundering raid against Italy in 947, {{which suggests that}} he was born considerably earlier than 931. His father's reign was preserved only in the Gesta Hungarorum; its <b>anonymous</b> <b>author</b> lists Zoltán among the grand princes, and all later Hungarian monarchs were descended from him. The Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus wrote around 950 that Fajsz, Taksony's cousin, was grand prince of the Hungarians at that time.|$|E
5|$|Several further would-be suitors {{visited the}} Skinkers, but all were repulsed by Tannakin's face and she {{remained}} unmarried. Despairing {{of finding a}} suitable husband in Wirkham, the Skinker family moved to London, and took up residence in either Blackfriars or Covent Garden. (The <b>anonymous</b> <b>author</b> of A Certaine Relation says that the family {{did not wish to}} divulge their address, to discourage curiosity-seekers from gathering.)

5|$|The epitomes of Aurelius Victor (De Caesaribus), Eutropius (Breviarium), Festus (Breviarium), and the <b>anonymous</b> <b>author</b> of the Epitome de Caesaribus offer {{compressed}} secular {{political and}} military histories of the period. Although not Christian, the epitomes paint a favorable image of Constantine, but omit reference to Constantine's religious policies. The Panegyrici Latini, a collection of panegyrics from the late third and early fourth centuries, provide valuable information on the politics and ideology of the tetrarchic period and the early life of Constantine. Contemporary architecture, such as the Arch of Constantine in Rome and palaces in Gamzigrad and Córdoba, epigraphic remains, and the coinage of the era complement the literary sources.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine writers {{held the}} Slavs in low {{regard for the}} simple life they led and also for their {{supposedly}} limited combat abilities, but in fact they were already {{a threat to the}} Danubian boundaries of the Empire in the early 6th century, where they waged plundering expeditions. Procopius, the <b>anonymous</b> <b>author</b> of Strategicon, and Theophylact Simocatta wrote at some length {{on how to deal with}} the Slavs militarily, which suggests that they had become a formidable adversary. John of Ephesus actually goes as far as saying in the last quarter of the 6th century that the Slavs had learned to conduct war better than the Byzantine army. The Balkan Peninsula was indeed soon overrun by the Slavic invaders during the first half of the 7th century under Emperor Heraclius.|$|E
5|$|Plays {{were being}} {{performed}} while Corder was still awaiting trial, and an <b>anonymous</b> <b>author</b> published a melodramatic {{version of the}} murder after the execution, a precursor of the Newgate novels which quickly became best-sellers. The Red Barn Murder was a popular subject, along {{with the story of}} Jack Sheppard and other highwaymen, thieves and murderers, for penny gaffs, cheap plays performed in the back rooms of public houses. James Catnach sold more than a million broadsides (sensationalist single sheet newspapers) which gave details of Corder's confession and the execution, and included a sentimental ballad supposedly written by Corder himself (though {{more likely to have been}} the work of Catnach or somebody in his employ). It was one of at least five ballads about the crime that appeared directly following the execution.|$|E
40|$|With online {{social media}} such as weblogs (blogs), authors {{seemingly}} control how much self identifying information they disclose. However {{we find that}} that even authors who wish to remain anonymous will share expressive and access enabling information which, when combined, {{can be used to}} positively identify the person. In a case study of three anonymous blogs we demonstrate how to combine investigative analysis with statistical techniques to identify <b>anonymous</b> <b>authors</b> {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. Paradoxically, <b>anonymous</b> <b>authors</b> feel as if they can be honest and open with their thoughts and opinions, and thus may be more likely to share more information than they might if their identities were known...|$|R

50|$|A song of five letters {{written by}} <b>anonymous</b> <b>authors</b> {{about their sexual}} {{preferences}} ("Suite for Five Letters").

5|$|The <b>anonymous</b> <b>author</b> {{tells us}} that Padarn's parents were nobly born Armoricans (Bretons), and that he sailed to Britain with 847 monks to settle and build a monastery. He {{established}} monasteries and churches throughout Ceredigion. The attempt of Maelgwn, king of Gwynedd, to ruin Padarn rebounds on him through a miracle, and he compensates Padarn with the gift of lands between the rivers Rheidol and Clarach. Saint Padarn is closely associated with Saint David and Saint Teilo in a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in which the three are honoured by the Patriarch. Padarn was given a tunic – which later featured in the best known legend associated with him – and a staff. Most likely this account is fabricated, as are much {{of the details of}} the lives of the early saints, from a variety of sources, real and imagined.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{source for}} the composition is a copied manuscript dated 1768, therefore {{the date of the}} composition is not certain. Research leads to a funeral of a former mayor of Mühlhausen on 16 September 1708. The text is a carefully compiled juxtaposition of biblical texts, three quotations from the Old Testament and four from the New Testament, combined with funeral hymns, of which two are sung and one is quoted instrumentally, and some additions by an <b>anonymous</b> <b>author.</b> Bach scored the work for four vocal parts and a small ensemble of Baroque instruments, two recorders, two violas da gamba and continuo. The work is opened by an instrumental Sonatina, followed by through-composed sections which have been assigned to three movements. The structure is symmetrical around a turning point, when the lower voices, who contemplate the Old Covenant, are overcome by a soprano calling for Jesus.|$|E
5|$|Traherne was an inconsequential {{literary}} figure {{during his}} lifetime and his works were not known or appreciated until long after his death. As a country priest he led a devout, humble life and {{did not participate in}} literary circles. Only one of his works, Roman Forgeries (1673), was published in his lifetime. Christian Ethicks (1675) followed soon after his death, and later A Serious and Patheticall Contemplation of the Mercies of God (1699), which was published as the work of an <b>anonymous</b> <b>author</b> whose character and background were discussed in a brief introduction by the publisher. From 1699 until the re-emergence of his work with Bertram Dobell's editions in 1903, Traherne's work fell into obscurity. If not for the chance discovery of an anonymous manuscript, his work and reputation might have been lost.|$|E

5|$|In July 1095, Urban {{turned to}} his {{homeland}} of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the Council of Clermont in November, where, according to the various speeches attributed to him, he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy, graphically detailing the fantastical atrocities being committed against pilgrims and eastern Christians. There are five versions of the speech recorded by {{people who may have}} been at the council (Baldric of Dol, Guibert of Nogent, Robert the Monk, and Fulcher of Chartres) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the <b>anonymous</b> <b>author</b> of the Gesta Francorum), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as William of Malmesbury and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus {{it is difficult to know}} what was actually said and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.|$|E
5|$|The African {{elephant}} {{was first}} named by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in 1797 as Elephas africanus. The genus Loxodonta was named by Frédéric Cuvier in 1825. Cuvier spelled it Loxodonte, but in 1827 an <b>anonymous</b> <b>author</b> romanised the spelling to Loxodonta; the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature recognises {{this as the}} proper authority. In 1942, 18 subspecies of African elephant were recognised by Henry Fairfield Osborn, but further morphological data has {{reduced the number of}} classified subspecies, and by the 1990s, only two were recognised, the savannah or bush elephant (L.a.africana) and the forest elephant (L.a.cyclotis), the latter having been named in 1900 by German zoologist Paul Matschie. Forest elephants have smaller and more rounded ears and thinner and straighter tusks than bush elephants, and are limited in range to the forested areas of western and Central Africa. A 2000 study argued for the elevation of the two forms into separate species (L.africana and L.cyclotis respectively) based on differences in skull morphology. DNA studies published in 2001 and 2007 also suggested they were distinct species while studies in 2002 and 2005 concluded that they were the same species. Further studies (2010, 2011, 2015) have supported African savannah and forest elephants' status as separate species. The two species are believed to have diverged 6 million years ago. In 2017, DNA sequence analysis showed that L. cyclotis is more closely related to the extinct Palaeoloxodon antiquus, than it is to L. africana, possibly undermining the genus Loxodonta as a whole. Some evidence suggests that elephants of western Africa are a separate species, although this is disputed. The pygmy elephants of the Congo Basin, which have been suggested to be a separate species (Loxodonta pumilio) are probably forest elephants whose small size and/or early maturity are due to environmental conditions.|$|E
