But this isn't really a resolution per se. It makes things a little bit more tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now the audience has one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s going to be fun waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E

After {{the success of}} Magic, Wizards published RoboRally in 1994, and it soon won the 1994 Origins Awards for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Board Game and Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game. Wizards also expanded its role-playing game line by buying SLA Industries from Nightfall Games and Ars Magica from White Wolf, Inc. in 1994. In 1995, Wizards published another card game by Richard Garfield, The Great Dalmuti, which won the 1995 Best New Mind Game award from Mensa. In August 1995, Wizards released Everway and then four months later closed its roleplaying game product line. Peter Adkison explained {{that the company was}} doing <b>a</b> <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> the games with lack of support and had lost money on all of Wizards' roleplaying game products.

25|$|According to Teotónio de Souza the Hindus faced severe {{persecution}} {{with great}} fortitude under the Portuguese in Goa.

Three years later Francis Xavier made a similar request {{in view of the}} Muslims in the region and the Christians abandoning their faith. On hearing of the excesses of the Inquisition in Goa, Lourenco Pires, Portuguese ambassador at Rome, expressed his displeasure to the crown while warning that this zeal for religion was actually becoming <b>a</b> <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> God and the kingdom.

40|$|OF INTERNAL MEDICINE has {{performed}} <b>a</b> minor <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> {{the medical profession}} and <b>a</b> major <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> the public. When this paper {{was presented at the}} New York Academy of Medicine, the majority of the audience was vociferous in their criticism of the paper, both on the grounds of scientific soundness and conclusions reached. Since physicians are cap-able of sophisticated judgments of medical presentations, the effect was minor. However, we all know that the lay public is not capable of such judgments. The paper received nation-wide publicity in the lay press, appearing in New York in the Times and the Tribune. The impression gained by the reader of the lay press is that periodic examinations are a waste of time. Now, there are many dedicated or-ganizations, from the American Cancer Society to ourselves, who have devoted enormous time and energy to educating the public that the best chance of cure or arrest of many illnesses —whether it be carcinoma or glaucoma—lies in early detection. There is an overwhelming mass of medical evidence to confirm this simple fact. To cast serious doubts on the value of the periodic examination through the media of nationwide publicity therefore renders <b>a</b> major <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> the public. I have personally been deluged with requests from the press—newspapers such as The New York Times, magazines such as Business Week and Newsweek, house organs and others—to elicit my opinion of the discouraging articles which appeared in The New York Times and New York Herald Tribune. I have done my best, {{and will continue to do}} all that I can, to offset the immense damage that has been done. I think that the ANNALS should profit from this experience, to the end of more careful selection of manuscripts that are medically controversial and lead to sensationalism in the lay press...|$|R

25|$|Throughout much of {{his adult}} life, Peckinpah was {{affected}} by alcoholism, and, later, other forms of drug addiction. According to some accounts, he also suffered from mental illness, possibly manic depression or paranoia. It is believed his drinking problems began during his service in the military while stationed in China, when he frequented the saloons of Tianjin and Beijing. After divorcing Selland, {{the mother of his}} first four children, in 1960, he married the Mexican actress Begoña Palacios in 1965. A stormy relationship developed, and over the years they married on three separate occasions. They had one daughter together. His personality reportedly often swung between a sweet, softly-spoken, artistic disposition, and bouts of rage and violence during which he verbally and physically abused himself and others. An experienced hunter, Peckinpah was fascinated with firearms and was known to shoot the mirrors in his house while abusing alcohol, an image which occurs several times in his films. Peckinpah's reputation as a hard-living brute with a taste for violence, inspired by the content in his most popular films and in many ways perpetuated by himself, affected his artistic legacy. His friends and family have claimed this does <b>a</b> <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> a man who was actually more complex than generally credited. Throughout his career, Peckinpah seems to have inspired extraordinary loyalty in certain friends and employees. He used the same actors (Warren Oates, L. Q. Jones, R. G. Armstrong, James Coburn, Ben Johnson, and Kris Kristofferson), and collaborators (Jerry Fielding, Lucien Ballard, Gordon Dawson, and Martin Baum) in many of his films, and several of his friends and assistants stuck by him {{to the end of his}} life.|$|E

It just seemed to take a little bit away from what the Enterprise cast and crew worked so diligently to achieve over the past four years." [...] While Frakes enjoyed working with Sirtis again, he said that [...] "the reality is {{it was a bit of}} a stretch to have us shut down [...] show," [...] and that in hindsight it was <b>a</b> <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> them.

500|$|Attanasio, Levinson and Fontana {{strove to}} make Homicide more {{realistic}} than other police dramas, even in minor details. For example, Levinson specifically asked that {{a dead body}} found by detectives in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] be badly decomposing and attracting flies because he felt other shows did not portray corpses in a realistic way. Some episodes, like [...] "Ghost of a Chance", focus on murders {{that take place in}} wealthy rural settings, rather than an urban or predominantly poorer location as most police dramas did. Homicide was noted for demonstrating better than most American television police shows that murders can take place in various socioeconomic circumstances. In striving for realism, some cases in Homicide remain unsolved and murderers go free, most notably in the Adena Watson case. This theme often put the show's producers at odds with NBC executives, who wanted happier endings with more closure. Fontana said of the Watson investigation, [...] "We never solved it because we felt that it would be <b>a</b> <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> the real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's not O.K. that she died, that no one took responsibility." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Three Men and Adena" [...] {{marked the}} {{conclusion}} of the Adena Watson murder case, a story arc which began {{at the start of the}} first season. The Watson case was based on the real-life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which is chronicled in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book that served as the basis of the Homicide series. Elements of the interview in [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] were incorporated from real-life police interrogations in that case. The Wallace case was never solved, and Fontana insisted that the Watson case in Homicide remain unsolved as well, despite pressure from NBC for a more satisfying conclusion. Fontana said, [...] "We never solved it because we felt that it would be <b>a</b> <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> the real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's not O.K. that she died, that no one took responsibility." [...] The scene when Tucker admits for a moment he is not sure in his own mind that he didn't commit the murder was inspired by a similar real-life interaction Fontana found in a police interrogation transcript during his research. Fontana said, [...] "It was so chilling (and) I was like, 'Oh man, how do you get there?'" ...|$|E

It was the first Atlus title to receive this rating. To promote the game, Atlus USA created a sweepstakes that ran between May and September 2004: the winner received a laptop decorated with the main protagonist's tattoo design, along with a free copy of the game. Due to backlogs at Sony Disc Manufacturing, Atlus delayed the release of the game by over three weeks to October 12. In compensation, DoubleJump Books offered free priority shipping worldwide for their Nocturne guidebook. The publishing rights in Europe were picked up by Midas Interactive, who published the game through their then-newly formed subsidiary Ghostlight under the title Shin Megami Tensei: Lucifer's Call. It released on July 1, 2005. Nocturne was the first Megami Tensei title to be released in Europe. It re-released for the PlayStation Network as a PlayStation 2 Classic in both North America and Europe: it released on May 6, 2014 for North America and May 20, 2015 for Europe.|$|E
500|$|The Shadow of the Glen, {{based on}} a story about an unfaithful wife, was {{attacked}} in print by the Irish nationalist leader Arthur Griffith as [...] "a slur on Irish womanhood". Years later Synge wrote: [...] "When I was writing The Shadow of the Glen some years ago I got more aid than any learning could have given me from a chink in {{the floor of the}} old Wicklow house where I was staying, that let me hear what was being said by the servant girls in the kitchen." [...] This encouraged more critical attacks alleging that Synge described Irish women in an unfair manner. Riders to the Sea was also attacked by nationalists, this time including Patrick Pearse, who decried it because of the author's attitude to God and religion. Pearse, Arthur Griffith and other conservative-minded Catholics claimed Synge had done <b>a</b> <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> Irish nationalism by not idealising his characters. However, later critics have attacked Synge for idealising the Irish peasantry too much. A third one-act play, The Tinker's Wedding, was drafted around this time, but Synge initially made no attempt to have it performed, largely because of a scene in which a priest is tied up in a sack, which, as he wrote to the publisher Elkin Mathews in 1905, would probably upset [...] "a good many of our Dublin friends".|$|E

[...] Molly Freeman, reviewing the season finale for Screen Rant, called the season as a whole [...] "Excellent", particularly praising the character development given to the character of Whitney Frost, but criticized the way that the season ended that character's storyline, stating that the finale [...] "does <b>a</b> <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> all the character development of Whitney throughout season 2....for the sake of sweeping her aside as easily as possible and giving the other cast members more development and screen time.
