50|$|A movable or <b>adjustable</b> <b>peg</b> {{system is}} a system of fixed {{exchange}} rates, but with a provision for the revaluation (usually devaluation) of a currency. For example, between 1994 and 2005, the Chinese yuan renminbi (RMB) was pegged to the United States dollar at RMB 8.2768 to $1. China {{was not the only}} country to do this; from the end of World War II until 1967, Western European countries all maintained fixed exchange rates with the US dollar based on the Bretton Woods system. http://www-econ.stanford.edu/faculty/workp/swp99020.pdf#search=%22western%20europe%20fixed%20exchange%20rate%201970%20us%20dollar%22 But that system had to be abandoned in favor of floating, market-based regimes due to market pressures and speculation, according to President Richard M.

50|$|Most modern bass {{clarinets}} are straight-bodied, {{with a small}} upturned silver-colored {{metal bell}} and a curved metal neck. Early examples varied in shape, some having a doubled body making them look similar to bassoons. The bass clarinet is fairly heavy and is supported either with a neck strap or with an <b>adjustable</b> <b>peg</b> attached to its body. While Adolphe Sax imitated its upturned metal bell in his design of the larger saxophones, the two instruments are fundamentally different. Bass clarinet bodies are most often made of grenadilla (African Blackwood) or (more commonly for student-instruments) plastic resin, while saxophones are typically made entirely of metal. (All-metal bass clarinets do exist, but are rare.) More significantly, all clarinets including the bass have a bore that is basically the same diameter along {{the body of the}} instrument. This cylindrical bore differs from the saxophone's conical one and gives the clarinet its characteristic tone, causing it to overblow at the twelfth compared with the saxophone's octave.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} major {{international}} financial crises in the 1990 s, {{and the recent}} introduction of the euro, have renewed interest in alternative exchange rate systems. The choice of exchange rate regime is particularly relevant for emerging-market countries because other countries are perceived either as having no alternative to their current exchange rate arrangement or as highly unlikely to change. This article examines the evolution of exchange rate regimes in emerging markets {{over the past decade}} and compares {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the various available systems. These include intermediate regimes, such as the <b>adjustable</b> <b>pegged</b> exchange rate popular throughout much of the post-war period, and the two extreme exchange rate regimes: permanently fixed or freely floating exchange rate regimes.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of sticky exchange rates to the rash of currency crises {{over the past}} decade has become a major topic of international monetary analysis and policy discussion. While there is widespread agreement among economists that the middle of the exchange rate spectrum, <b>adjustable</b> <b>pegs,</b> is highly crisis-prone in a world of substantial capital mobility, Jeffrey Frankel has recently argued that, surprisingly, we lack a clear theoretical rationale for why this is so. This paper attempts to fill that void. It argues that Frankel is correct in terms of economic analysis alone, but that when political economy considerations are introduced then a satisfactory explanation is at hand. Key aspects of this political economy perspective are laid out and implications for exchange rate policy are considered. The analysis suggests that for promoting currency stability the traditionally debated distinctions between crawling bands and managed floats are likely less important than the political environments in which they are operated.

40|$|After {{twenty years}} of {{floating}} exchange rates, there is now considerable inter-est, among those concerned over its perceived shortcomings, in an eventual return by the world to a fixed exchange rate regime.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} of currency convertibility {{in the process of}} economic transition in Eastern Europe and discusses alternative institutional options for achieving this difficult task. It shows that an early transition to convertibility is an indispensable requirement for the success of real sector reforms but that this is only sustainable if the existing flow and stock disequilibria are removed. The options of flexible rates and an East European Payments Union seem less demanding in terms of internal financial stringency, but the former would lead to a high degree of exchange rate instability and the latter would only provide a very limited foreign impact on the domestic restructuring. The paper, therefore, focuses on fixed rate solutions (or <b>adjustable</b> <b>pegs</b> with a preannounced depreciation rate). It shows that the credibility of the exchange rate commitment and the degree of internal financial stringency, which are both crucial for the sustainability of convertibility and for a non-inflationary monetary framework in Eastern Europe, can be considerably increased if all monetary policy competencies are transferred to a supranational institution which is designed according to the blueprint for a European System of Central Banks.

40|$|From 1990 onwards, Eastern European {{countries}} have {{had as a}} primary economic goal the convergence with the traditionally capitalist states in Western Europe. The usage of various exchange rate regimes to accomplish the convergence of inflation and interest rates, {{in order to create}} a fully functional macroeconomic environment has been one of the fundamental characteristics of states in Eastern Europe for the past 20 years.

40|$|Based on a {{systematic}} review and summarization of China’s 30 years of financial reform and development, this paper comprehensively analyzes the past, {{present and future}} development of China’s financial system and also presents the mechanism for China’s financial development from the view of political economics. Generally, the Chinese financial system is bank-oriented. The property rights structure, led by state-owned banks, is the prominent feature of the Chinese banking system. Equity, bond, money, currency and real estate markets have been developing rapidly; however, the development rate of these markets varies, and institutional construction generally falls behind the market development. China’s financial decision-making authority belongs to the State Council, and the financial supervision system adopts the mode of “separate regulation. ” China’s state-driven, progressive financial reforms have promoted {{the formation of the}} government-led financial structure, which is composed of three parts: first, monetary policy, balancing both inflation control and economic growth; second, bank credit expansion under the implicit guarantee of the state; and third, the <b>adjustable</b> <b>pegged</b> exchange rate system based on capital controls. The next phase of financial reform in China will mainly focus on the following four key goals: first, to further improve the corporate governance and the mixed operation of financial institutions; second, to construct the institution of a financial market system and improve the effectiveness of the financial markets; third, to re-integrate regulatory resources, combine macro- and micro-prudent views, and establish a comprehensive framework for financial stability; fourth, to promote the liberalization of interest rates, marketization of the exchange rate and the opening of capital accounts based on a progressive approach and to improve the openness of the financial system based on macroeconomic stability. ...|$|R
40|$|Credibility and {{transparency}} {{are at the}} core of the current debate about exchange rate regimes. The steady growth in the magnitude and variability of international capital flows has complicated the question of whether to use floating, fixed, or intermediate exchange rate regimes. Emerging market economies are abandoning basket pegs, crawling <b>pegs,</b> bands, <b>adjustable</b> <b>pegs,</b> and various combinations of these. One of several reasons intermediate regimes have fallen out of favor is that they are not transparent; it is very difficult to verify them. Verifiability is a concrete example of the principle of"transparency"so often invoked in discussions of the new international financial architecture but so seldom made precise. A simple peg or a simple float may be easier for market participants to verify than a more complicated intermediate regime. The authors investigate how difficult it is for investors to verify from observable data whether the authorities are in fact following the exchange rate regime they claim to be following. Of the various intermediate regimes, they focus on basket pegs with bands. Statistically, it can take a surprisingly long span of data for an econometrician or investor to verify whether such a regime is actually in operation. The authors find that verification becomes more difficult as the regime's bands widen or more currencies enter the basket peg. At the other extreme, they also analyze regimes described as the regime's bands widen or more currencies enter the basket peg. At the other extreme, they also analyze regimes described as free floating and find that in some cases the observed exchange rate data do validate the announced regime.

5|$|As the {{inception}} of the United Nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in 1944, delegates from 44 of its early member states met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, now commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods conference. Delegates remained cognizant {{of the effects of the}} Great Depression, struggles to sustain the international gold standard during the 1930s, and related market instabilities. Whereas previous discourse on the international monetary system focused on fixed versus floating exchange rates, Bretton Woods delegates favored pegged exchange rates for their flexibility. Under this system, nations would peg their exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, which would be convertible to gold at $35 USD per ounce. This arrangement is commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods system. Rather than maintaining fixed rates, nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar and allow their exchange rates to fluctuate within a 1% band of the agreed-upon parity. To meet this requirement, central banks would intervene via sales or purchases of their currencies against the dollar. Members could adjust their pegs in response to long-run fundamental disequillibria in the balance of payments, but were responsible for correcting imbalances via fiscal and monetary policy tools before resorting to repegging strategies. The <b>adjustable</b> <b>pegging</b> enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and financial transactions which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment. This feature grew from delegates' experiences in the 1930s when excessively volatile exchange rates and the reactive protectionist exchange controls that followed proved destructive to trade and prolonged the deflationary effects of the Great Depression. Capital mobility faced de facto limits under the system as governments instituted restrictions on capital flows and aligned their monetary policy to support their pegs.|$|R
