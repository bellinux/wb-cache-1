50|$|They were {{notable for}} being the first {{warships}} to use steam turbine propulsion. They had Parsons turbines on four shafts, with two propellers on each, one inboard and one outboard of the shaft <b>A-bracket.</b>|$|E
5000|$|She was {{notable for}} being the first warship to use steam turbine {{propulsion}} [...] and was manufactured by Parsons Marine. There were four shafts, with two propellers on each, one inboard and one outboard of the shaft <b>A-bracket.</b>|$|E
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} of the 406 also did away with the outdated <b>A-bracket</b> of all previous Bristols for a more modern Watt's linkage. The 406 was the world's first production car to be thus equipped. However, the outdated front suspension of previous Bristols was retained and not updated until the following model with its more powerful drivetrain.|$|E
50|$|In the Incident the German tanker rammed {{her with}} the stern in an angle of about 30° at the {{altitude}} of her bridge and pressed the destroyer towards the fiord wall. The Norwegian officers present later reported, that only the mass of ice piled up averted the destroyer to crash onto the rocky shore. The powerful engines of the destroyer made her escape from the squeeze possible. Cossack arrived at Leith on 17 February with the 299 freed prisoners. She had to be docked for her propellor and <b>A-brackets</b> to be checked in case they had been damaged by the thick ice in the fiord. They were unharmed, but her stern plating had to be repaired {{where it had been}} bumping against Altmark.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was decided}} to sail her to Alexandria, where there were {{suitable}} docking facilities, However she could not steer a straight course, and could not make more than 8 kn. She {{got as far as}} Suez Bay, but could not attempt the Suez Canal in that condition. Lt Cmdr Peter Keeble, an experienced diver and salvage expert, personally supervised the removal of her two inner screw shafts near the gland. The <b>A-brackets</b> holding the shafts and screws were also cut, dropping both screws and shafts to the bottom. Keeble had perfected available underwater cutting torches by combining British and Italian technology to cut away the thick propeller shafts. [...] She returned to the UK and was decommissioned in July 1945.|$|R
50|$|Whilst the Cortina Lotus is {{somewhat}} {{overshadowed by the}} success of the Ford Escort in rallying, it performed admirably in the mid-1960s, which might be surprising, given its reputation for unreliability. The first Cortina Lotus to be rallied was a Cortina GT with the Lotus engine, in the 1963 Spa-Sofia-Liege rally in September, just to try out the engine, and driven by Henry Taylor to 4th place. The first outing in a rally by a Cortina Lotus proper was in the 1963 RAC Rally, campaigned again by Taylor, with co-driver Brian Melia. It finished 6th somehow, in spite of its <b>A-bracket</b> rear end needing constant attention. The <b>A-bracket</b> was persevered with by Vic Elford and David Seigle-Morris for the 1964 Tour de France Automobile, a 10-day, 4000 mi event, as it was run completely on sealed roads, unlike the rough RAC Rally. Their car came 4th outright in the Touring Car category, and first in the Handicap category, in a mix of one-hour sprints, hillclimbs, and mountain road rallying.|$|E
50|$|The 400 {{featured}} {{independent front suspension}} with a transverse {{leaf spring}} and a live axle, located by an <b>A-bracket</b> over the differential case and longitudinal torsion bars with transverse arms and brackets at the rear. It featured a lengthy 2895 mm (114 inch) wheelbase and a very BMW-like grille {{at the front of}} its long bonnet. The passenger area was very short, with the spare tyre mounted inside the boot on the first cars, but eventually mounted on the rear hinged boot lid, inside an aluminum cover.|$|E
5000|$|The example {{described}} in the paper by Weinstein et al. comes from a Lie bialgebroid, i.e. A a Lie algebroid (with anchor [...] and bracket [...] ), also its dual [...] a Lie algebroid (inducing the differential [...] on [...] ) and [...] (where on the RHS you extend the <b>A-bracket</b> to [...] using graded Leibniz rule). This notion is symmetric in A and [...] (see Roytenberg). Here [...] with anchor [...] and the bracket is the skew-symmetrization of the above in X and α (equivalently in Y and β): ...|$|E
50|$|Still, {{the general}} dodginess of the <b>A-bracket</b> {{suspension}} meant that Ford decided {{to replace it}} with the more conventional GT rear suspension. This became available in June 1965, and while the car still seemed to be afflicted with bad luck, a few victories were racked up. Four of the newly updated cars competed in the Alpine rally of July 1965, and Vic Elford's car led outright, all the way. Well, until less than an hour from finishing, when a piece of the distributor fell out and delayed the car 26 minutes. All four cars retired from that year's RAC rally, which was severely snow-affected. The first works victory came in December 1965, when Roger Clark and Graham Robson won the Welsh International.|$|E
