The portion of the weight loss due to enzymatic autolysis is due mainly to solubilization of a glucan and, to a small extent, to liberation of free glucose. No other carbohydrate wall components or sugars other than glucose are solubilized despite the high concentrations of, for example, galactans, <b>arabans,</b> and xylans in the walls.

40|$|In recent years, the {{development}} of low erucic acid and low glucosinolate cultivars of canola has resulted in increased use of canola as a high-quality protein source (canola meal) in poultry diets [1]. Its nutritive value, however, {{is limited by the}} presence of several antinutritive factors including indigestible nonstarch polysac-charides (NSP), aromatic choline esters (such as sinapine), and phytic acid [2]. Canola meal con-tains on average 2. 5 % of galacto-oligosaccha-rides and 18 % of NSP of which 1. 5 % is soluble [1]. The major NSP components found in canola meal are pectic polysaccharides, which include rhamnogalacturonan with associated side chains consisting of arabinose, galactose, and xylose residues [3]. These sugars can occur in short or long complex side chains containing neutral pectic polymers, such as <b>arabans,</b> galactans, or arabinogalactans [4]. Other polysaccharides of canola meal include cellulose, xylans, arabi-noxylans, and xyloglucans, which are predomi-nantly found in the hull fraction.

5000|$|Botrytis allii {{is able to}} use polysaccharide-degrading enzymes {{to enter}} their onion host. [...] These enzymes are able to degrade onion cell wall {{components}} such as sodium polypectate, citrus pectin, lupin galactan, <b>araban,</b> xylan and carboxymethyl cellulose. The most active enzyme that Botrytis allii uses is polygalacturonase, {{which is used to}} degrade sodium polypectate. When the fungus attempts to penetrate the epidermal cells of the onion there is an observed accumulation of granular deposits, called reaction material, that are found between the cell wall and plasma membrane. The reaction material correlates with reduced fungal growth between the cell walls where it is found. During infection, the onion will also produce hydroxycinnamic acid amide, which is a common plant defense response. There may also be some cytoskeletal rearrangements within the onion so that it can provide a better route to deliver the phenolic products to the fungal penetration site.|$|E

40|$|Wild type Bacillus subtilis, when {{grown on}} beet <b>araban,</b> secretes into its culture medium an endo-arabanase and two arabinosidases. An {{alternate}} procedure to one previously described (Kaji A, T Saheki 1975 Biochim Biophys Acta 410 : 354 - 360) {{has been developed}} for the purification of the endo-arabanase. The purified endo-arabanase is shown to be homogeneous by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea disc gel electrophoresis (molecular weight ≃ 32, 000) and by isoelectric focusing (pI = 9. 3). The endo-arabanase, acting on a branched <b>araban</b> substrate, has maximal activity at pH 6. 0 and preferentially cleaves 5 -linked arabinosyl residues. One of the arabinosidases (molecular weight ≃ 65, 000, pI = 5. 3) has been purified {{to the point that}} it contains only one quantitatively minor contaminant, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea disc gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. The purified arabinosidase, acting on p-nitrophenyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside, has maximal activity at pH 6. 5, and, when acting on a branched <b>araban</b> substrate, preferentially attacks nonreducing terminal arabinosyl residues linked to the 2 or 3 position of other arabinosyl residues. Neither of the two purified enzymes is capable of hydrolyzing a variety of carbohydrate substrates which lack arabinosidic linkages. The purified endo-arabinase is shown to be capable of releasing arabinosyl oligomers from the walls of suspension-cultured sycamore cells, thereby suggesting its usefulness as a probe in studying the structure of the <b>araban</b> component of primary cell walls...|$|E
40|$|When Corticium rolfsii {{is grown}} under aerobic {{conditions}} {{in a medium}} containing one of several simple sugars or polysaccharides, it release α-L-arabinofuranosidase into the culture fluid. <b>Araban</b> and bran extract {{were found to be}} the most effective carbon sources in stimulating the production of the enzyme. Pectin and arabinose stimulated the production of the enzyme to a lesser degree, whereas xylose, glucose, galactose, and sucrose caused the formation of a relatively small amount of α-L-arabinofuranosidase. α-L-Arabinofuranosidase was demonstrated by its ability to hydrolyze phenyl-α-L-arabinofuranoside, <b>araban,</b> and arabinoxylan. The pH optimum of the enzyme was 2. 5. At pH values of 2 to 9, the enzyme lost less than 15 % of its activity during a 72 -hr period at 2 C. At 70 C, its stability was greatest at pH values of 4 to 6...|$|E
40|$|Fractionation of pectic polysaccharides {{from the}} juice of {{ripening}} `Bartlett' pears (Pyrus communis) gave two general types of polyuronides. The major type was a homogalacturonan (HGA) whose molecular weight decreased upon ripening. The other type comprised heteropolymers composed of various amounts of arabinose, rhamnose, and galactose. Treatment {{of the major}} arabinose-containing heteropolymeric fraction of high molecular weight (400, 000) with a pear exo-polygalacturonase to degrade contaminating HGA gave a polyuronide which was inert to tomato endopolygalacturonase. Glycosyl-linkage analysis of this arabinosyl-polyuronide gave results expected from a rhamnogalacturonan I-like polysaccharide with large, highly branched <b>araban</b> side chains (RG-I). A linkage between HGA and RG-I was not found. RG-I, in ripening pears, appeared to be degraded with the initial loss of much of its arabinose...|$|E
40|$|A mouse {{antiserum}} to ragweed arabinogalactan (AGRg) agglutinated rabbit {{red blood}} cells coupled to AGRg by bis-diazotized benzidine. The antibodies to AGRg could be absorbed out with a yeast phosphogalactan but not with a yeast phosphomannan. A beet <b>araban</b> was also ineffective. Whole pollen grains from ragweed, timothy, wheat, barley and rye as well as commercial pollen extracts such as ragweed, timothy, sage and maple produced complete inhibition of haemagglutination. These studies suggest that cross-reactions between unrelated pollens previously reported {{may have been due}} to the presence of arabinogalactans in the materials employed. The permeability-enhancing effects of AGRg in mice could be completely inhibited by D-galactose, D-fucose or by galactose containing oligosaccharides. The stereochemical specificity of this inhibition suggests, but by no means proves, that the in vivo effects of AGRg are due to its interaction with natural antibody...|$|E
40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{accounts for}} about 95 per cent {{of the disease and}} its characteristic feature is insulin resistance 1. Several drugs to increase the insulin sensitivity are currently being used. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (PTP 1 B) has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic target in effective treatment of type 2 diabetes 2. In traditional system of medicine many plants have been claimed to be useful in the treatment of diabetes mellitus 3 - 6. Psidium guajava Linn. (family: Myrtaceae) is a semi-deciduous tropical tree and is widely grown throughout India for its fruit called Guava (amrud in Hindi). The fruit a berry, when unripe is considered indigestible, while the ripe one is a good aperient. The fruit contains a high percentage of vitamin C, carotene, vitamin B 1, B 2, B 6, free sugars (glucose, fructose and sucrose), pectin and water soluble <b>araban</b> 7.

40|$|Enzymes {{in culture}} filtrates of Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn grown using 4 -day old or 20 -day old bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) {{hypocotyl}} cell walls as a carbon source degraded xylan, galactan, galactomannan, <b>araban,</b> polygalacturonic acid, and carboxymethylcellulose. Extracts of lesions from R. solani infected plants, but not healthy plants, contained similar enzymatic activities. These enzyme sources readily solubilized cell wall constituents containing arabinose, galactose, and glucose from 4 -day old, {{but not from}} 20 -day old, bean cell walls. Analysis of cell walls prepared from infected plants revealed that the alterations in cell wall composition in the diseased host were limited largely to the immediate lesion areas and occurred during the early phases of pathogenesis. The cell walls of young susceptible bean seedlings could be degraded by R. solani enzymes, but the cell walls of older plants which are resistant to this pathogen were not susceptible to enzymatic destruction by the same enzyme preparation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{the present}} study has been to {{determine}} microfungi flora of 43 soil samples, extracted from a depth of 0 - 15 cm, from 43 agricultural localities taking place in Yavuzeli, <b>Araban,</b> Karkamış, Nizip and Oğuzeli counties of Gaziantep with high susceptibility to erosion through the soil dilution method at the level of species. In these soils, which have quite high K-factor ranging between 0. 3 and 0. 79, quite poor in organic matter and have slightly alkaline nature, 2 divisions, 3 subphyla, 4 classes, 4 subclasses, 5 orders and 7 genera from microfungi flora were determined. The microfungi species, has been Rhizopus sp., Mucor sp., Penicillium sp. and Aspergillus sp. respectively. Cladosporium sp., Acremonium sp. and Candida sp. species have also been encountered in a couple of localities. The results suggest that microfungal diversity of these soils under study is low due to high susceptibility to erosion and insufficient organic content.

40|$|Cell {{walls of}} Zea mays (cv L. G. 11) {{seedlings}} labeled with 14 C {{were treated with}} α-amylase from Bacillus subtilis to remove starch and mixed linkage glucans. These walls released arabinose, xylose, galactose, and galacturonic acid in addition to glucose when {{they were allowed to}} autolyze. Methylation analysis was performed on samples of wall which had been incubated autolytically and the results indicated that degradation of the major polymer of the wall, the glucoarabinoxylan, had occurred. A number of glycanases could be dissociated from the wall by use of 3 m LiCL. The proteins which were released were found to contain a number of exoglycosidase activities in addition to being effective in degrading the polysaccharide substrates, <b>araban,</b> xylan, galactan, laminarin, mannan, and polygalacturonic acid. The effects of these enzymes on the wall during autolysis appear to result from endo-activity in addition to exo-activity. The structural changes that occurred in the cell walls during autolysis were found {{to be related to the}} changes previously found to occur in cell walls during auxin induced extension...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} has been to determine microalgea flora of 46 soil samples, extracted from a depth of 0 - 15 cm, from 46 agricultural localities taking place in Yavuzeli, <b>Araban,</b> Karkamış, Nizip and Oğuzeli counties of Gaziantep with high susceptibility to erosion (K-factor) through the soil dilution method at the level of species. In these soils, which have quite high K-factor ranging between 0. 3 and 0. 79, quite poor in organic matter and have slightly alkaline nature, 3 divisions, 3 phyla, 3 classes, 6 orders 7 families and 8 genera from microalgea flora were determined. The microalgea species, which have been encountered in the highest number of localities, has been Chroococcidiopsis sp., Pseudoanabaena sp., and Anabaena sp. respectively. Nostoc sp., Hantzschia sp., Tetraselmis sp., Hasallia sp., Phormidium sp. and Cylindrospermum sp. species have also been encountered in a couple of localities. The results suggest that microfungal diversity of these soils under study is low due to high susceptibility to erosion and insufficient organic content. Therefore, the required measures should be taken for microbial enrichment of the soils. If the required measures are not taken, aggregate stability of the soils also may decrease. Microalgea increase resistance of soils to erosion because there is a strong correlation between aggregate stability and microalgea activity...|$|E
40|$|Two arabinofuranosidases, termed Ara I and Ara II, from {{solid-state}} {{cultures of}} Penicillium capsulatum were purified to apparent homogeneity as judged by electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. Each enzyme {{is a single}} subunit glycoprotein, and they have M(r) s and pIs of 64, 500 and 4. 15 (Ara I) and 62, 700 and 4. 54 (Ara II), respectively. Ara I is most active at pH 4. 0 and 60 degrees C, while Ara II exhibits optimal activity at pH 4. 0 and 55 degrees C. Ara I is the more thermostable, with its half-life at 70 degrees C and pH 4. 0 being 17. 5 min. By contrast, the half-life of Ara II is only 9 min at 60 degrees C and pH 4. 0. Ara I has the lower Km and higher catalytic constant values with p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside being used as the substrate. Arabinose, a competitive inhibitor (Ki, 16. 4 mM) of Ara II, {{has no effect on}} Ara I activity at concentrations of up to 40 mM. Each enzyme catalyzes the release of arabinose from pectin, <b>araban,</b> and certain arabinose-containing xylans. The last activity is enhanced by pretreatment of the relevant substrates with xylanase, ferulic acid esterase, or combinations of these enzymes. Thus, arabinoxylooligosaccharides in which arabinose is the sole side chain substituent appear to be the preferred substrates. On the basis of the evidence cited above, each enzyme has been classified as an alpha-L-arabinofuranoside arabinofuranohydrolase (EC 3. 2. 1. 79) ...|$|E
40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 65 : 05 in length. Intended {{as a representative}} sampling of the available trumpet literature, this program contains works {{from each of the}} main style periods, presented in chronological order. Using typical Baroque forms [...] ritornello, ostinato, fugue [...] Torelli's Sonata (G- 1) illustrates the balanced structure, elegance of expression, and lyricism peculiar to the "Bologna school,??? {{which is one of the}} earliest sources of solo works specifically for trumpet. Haydn??? s Concerto in E-flat, written in 1796 for Anton Weidinger, is a thorough exploration of the possibilities of Heidinger's new 1 keyed trumpet. While digressions in tonality are avoided for the most part, the instrument's new-found chromaticism is fully exploited. The forms used [...] sonata-allegro, ternary, and rondo [...] are entirely typical of the Classic period. The Romantic era is represented by Arban' s variations on a theme from Norma. A display piece, the Variations demonstrate many of the technical innovations, one of which is triple tonguing, introduced by <b>Araban</b> in his famous Method for the Cornet. The Hindemith Sonate is a mainstay of the	 contemporary literature for trumpet. Its traditional forms [...] sonata-allegro, ternary, end with coda [...] reflect Hindemith' s neo-classicism; while the musical content powerfully expresses the social and political turmoil of Germany on the verge of war. The Sonate was written in 1939. Encounters III, published in 1973, demonstrates current trends in composition. Use of non-traditional forms, aleatoric techniques, the absense of tonality in the usual sense, and the use of percussion rather than piano, all are typical...|$|E
40|$|Biodegradation is {{the general}} term used for all biologically {{mediated}} break down of chemical compounds and complete biodegradation leads to mineralization. On the other hand, bioremediation is a pollution control technology that uses biological systems to catalyze the degradation or transformation of various toxic chemicals to less harmful forms. The fungi are unique among microorganisms in that they secrete a variety of extracellular enzymes. The ability of fungi to transform {{a wide variety of}} hazardous chemicals has aroused interest in using them in bioremediation. Fungi are good in the accumulation of heavy metals and the role of fungi in the degradation of complex carbon compounds such as starch, cellulose, pectin, lignin, lignocellulose, inulin, xylan, <b>araban</b> etc., is well known. The white rot fungi are unique among eukaryotes for having evolved nonspecific methods for the degradation of lignin. They do not use lignin as a carbon source and is, therefore, essentially a secondary metabolic process, not required for the main growth process. A wide variety of fungi has been shown to degrade a number of toxic xenobiotics such as aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated organic, nitrogen aromatics and several miscellaneous compounds such as sulfonatedazo dyes etc. Several enzymes that are released such as laccases, polyphenol oxidases, lignin peroxidases etc. {{play a role in the}} degradative process. In addition, a variety of intracellular enzymes such as reductases, methyl transferases and cytochrome oxygenases are known to play a role in xenobiotic degradation.
