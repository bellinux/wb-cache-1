5|$|Although mantises <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> {{mentioned}} in Ancient Greek sources, a female mantis in threat posture is accurately illustrated {{on a series}} of fifth-century BC silver coins, including didrachms, from Metapontum in Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Below {{are some}} {{slightly}} {{different versions of}} the second and third stanzas and the chorus, plus an additional fourth stanza. These <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> sung.|$|E
25|$|Because {{infection}} <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> symptomatic, treatment <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> required. There {{have been}} no published trials so treatment remains empirical. Agents {{that have been used}} include albendazole, metronidazole and cotrimoxazole for myositis. Corticosteroids have also been used for symptomatic relief.|$|R
50|$|FGM <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> practiced.|$|R
25|$|N ephelkystikon <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> omitted.|$|R
5|$|Columns {{that are}} often {{deployed}} singularly, supporting plain arches and thus displaying {{the influence of the}} earlier and much plainer Norman period (Illustration 3). Columns <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> encountered, as elsewhere in Europe, in clustered groups acting as piers, especially in examples of early Sicilian Baroque.|$|E
5|$|Compounds {{containing}} tantalum <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> {{encountered in}} the laboratory. The metal is highly biocompatible and is used for body implants and coatings, therefore attention may be focused on other elements or the physical nature of the chemical compound.|$|E
5|$|Epigenetic {{alterations}} in expression of BRCA2 (causing over-expression or under-expression) are very frequent in sporadic cancers (see Table below) while mutations in BRCA2 <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> found.|$|E
50|$|N ephelkystikon <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> omitted.|$|R
40|$|Parasitic {{infection}} of the appendix <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> seen, but {{should be considered in}} patients with symptoms of chronic appendicitis. It <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> associated with histological inflammation of the appendix, therefore radiographic imaging, performed during initial workup, remains unremarkable most of the time...|$|R
50|$|It {{can be seen}} radiographically (i.e., with x-rays), {{although}} it <b>is</b> seen <b>rarely</b> in developed countries, given that osteomyelitis <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> left untreated there.|$|R
5|$|River {{dolphins}} <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> kept in captivity; breeding {{success has}} been poor and the animals often die {{within a few months}} of capture. , there are only three river dolphins in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Abbreviations <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> {{used in the}} codex. The {{handwriting}} is {{very close}} to that of the Rossano Gospels. The errors of itacism occur, but not so often as in Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus. It uses grammatical forms typical of the ancient manuscripts (e.g. ειπαν, ηλθαν, ευραν), which are not used in later medieval manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids also exhibit both {{schooling}} and shoaling behaviours. Very young bigfin reef squids will also stay close together (shoaling), {{but do not}} swim together {{parallel to each other}} (schooling). Unlike most other squid species, bigfin reef squids <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> cannibalistic. Shoals can include animals of different sizes without the threat of larger members attacking and consuming the smaller members. Whether bigfin reef squids recognise each other individually still remains unknown.|$|E
30|$|Cyproheptadine {{poisoning}} has <b>been</b> <b>rarely</b> reported.|$|R
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> {{found in}} nurseries.|$|R
50|$|The kuisi bunsi {{has five}} tone holes, but {{only four of}} them are used when performing: the lower tone hole <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> used, but when used, the upper tone hole is closed with wax. The lower tone hole of the kuisi sigi <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> used.|$|R
5|$|Care {{needs to}} be taken when {{machining}} hafnium because it is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously combust when exposed to air. Compounds that contain this metal <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should be handled as if they were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{sex workers}} (including those in pornography) have an {{increased}} rate of HIV. Rough sex can be a factor {{associated with an increased}} risk of transmission. Sexual assault is also believed to carry an increased risk of HIV transmission as condoms <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> worn, physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely, and there may be a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|Culture: Although {{there are}} many {{differences}} between Eastern and Western cultures, including as to how often family names or initials are used, the effect seems to apply across cultures. In their study with subjects from Thailand, where the family name is rarely used, Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun found a much stronger effect for first name than family name. Kitayama and Karasawa found no special effect for initials in Japan, where name initials <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> used, but did find an overall name-letter effect.|$|E
50|$|Unlike Scrub Island, {{a larger}} {{island off the}} Eastern Tip and which has two {{excellent}} beaches, Anguillita <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> even seen, since the western tip is virtually inaccessible by foot. As such it <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> visited by tourists, though it is accessible by sea kayak.|$|R

50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> {{cultivated}} in British gardens.|$|R
5|$|Dominica's folk musical {{heritage}} includes work songs, storytelling, children's {{music and}} masquerade songs. Dominican work songs {{are accompanied by}} the tambou twavay drum, and are performed by workers while gathering fruit, building roads, fishing, moving a house or sawing wood. Many are responsorial, and are generally short and simple, with the lyrical text and rhythm tying into the work to be accompanied. On modern Dominica, work songs <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> performed.|$|E
5|$|Envenomation from a redback spider bite {{produces}} a syndrome known as latrodectism. A {{small but significant}} percentage of people bitten develop significant pain or systemic symptoms. The diagnosis is made from the clinical condition, often based on the victim being aware of a bite and ideally with identification of the spider. Laboratory tests <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> needed {{and there is no}} specific test for the venom or latrodectism.|$|E
5|$|In 1086, 7- and 10-point girih {{patterns}} (with heptagons, 5- and 6-pointed stars, triangles {{and irregular}} hexagons) {{appear in the}} Friday Mosque at Isfahan. 10-point girih became widespread in the Islamic world, except in the Spanish Al-Andalus. Soon afterwards, sweeping 9-, 11-, and 13-point girih patterns {{were used in the}} Barsian Mosque, also in Persia, in 1098; these, like 7-point geometrical patterns, <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> used outside Persia and central Asia.|$|E

5000|$|... 3. The {{logarithm}} of {{the expected}} value of the response variable is a linear combination of the explanatory variables. This assumption is so fundamental that it <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> mentioned, but like most linearity assumptions, it <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> exact and often simply made to obtain a tractable model.|$|R
5|$|Leaves : Simple, entire (smooth and even), linear, oval to {{filiform}} (thread-like), {{mostly with}} parallel veins, but occasionally net-veined. They are alternate (single and alternating direction) and spiral, {{but may be}} whorled (three or more attached at one node, e.g. Lilium, Fritillaria), cauline (arranged along the aerial stem) or sheathed in a basal rosette. They <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> petiolate (stem attached before apex), and lack stipules. The aerial stem is unbranched.|$|E
5|$|Mammals <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> {{consumed}} by river otters, {{and are not}} a major dietary component. Mammals preyed upon by otters are characteristically small or are a type species found in riparian zones. The few occurrences of mammals found in the river otter's diet include: muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus); meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus); eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus); and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus).|$|E
5|$|Niobium-containing {{compounds}} <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> {{encountered by}} most people, {{but some are}} toxic and should be treated with care. The short- and long-term exposure to niobates and niobium chloride, two chemicals that are water-soluble, have been tested in rats. Rats treated with a single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a median lethal dose (LD50) between 10 and 100mg/kg. For oral administration the toxicity is lower; a study with rats yielded a LD50 after seven days of 940mg/kg.|$|E
