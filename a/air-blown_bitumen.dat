40|$|The cost {{of natural}} bitumen {{production}} at present {{is very high}} and 3 - 5 times exceeds the cost of conventional oils production; the technology developers are facing the challenge of developing processes which allow producing high sale price products at a low cost. The present study was aimed at finding out the composition and properties of natural bitumen from Nagornoye deposit of the Republic of Tatarstan (JSC Troitskneft) to determine the possible ways for its processing {{as well as to}} definite the processing options. A conclusion made, that the production of residual bitumen of the high-viscosity oils and natural bitumen of Tatarstan Republic (as well as any other region having raw materials with similar composition) will contribute to increase in their production volume and quality by means of compounding of residual and <b>air-blown</b> <b>bitumen,</b> as in this particular case their advantages are combined. In addition, this will contribute to solution of the problem related to introduction of water-bitumen emulsions and bitumen-polymer binders into the road construction of Tatarstan Republic. The use of natural bitumen for production of various commercial bitumen marks and various bitumen products, makes its recovery economically feasible as its conventional recovery and transportation is noncompetitive against conventional oils. At the same time, profitability of a pure bitumen option can be increased by means of a bitumen-fuel option, provided that the diesel fraction is brought in full compliance with the GOST for...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: One of the {{effective}} {{ways to improve the}} properties of special bitumens are their chemical and physical modification. When considering a chemical approach, we assumed that a process of oxidative polymerization is connected with radical-chain reactions. That is why when carrying out an oxidizing process of residual oil stock, it is necessary to use the modifiers, which are able to take part in this process, subjecting the segments of paraffin chains to chemical structuring with further formation of polycyclic naphthene-aromatic fragments, promoting the intense resin formation and preventing from the formation of the asphaltene crystalline phase. The analysis of physical-mechanical properties of bituminous insulating materials (BIM), based on acidified flux oil, showed the ambiguity of their assessment, i. e. at identical speeds of fuel-oil residues oxidation processes, there are differences in strength properties of coverings (C). The properties of <b>air-blown</b> asphaltic <b>bitumen</b> are regulated by resizing of the core and solvation shell of the complex structural unit (CSU) by injection of multicomponent bifunctional modifier (MBM), promoting the reduction of oxidation duration and the improvement of physical-mechanical and insulation properties of BIM.
