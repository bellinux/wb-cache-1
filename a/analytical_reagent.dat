40|$|This review {{describes}} a comprehensive investigation focusing on syntheses of <b>analytical</b> <b>reagents,</b> followed by their utilization in development of analytical methods, and leading to practical applications for rational use of medicaments centering on abused drugs. Many kinds of <b>analytical</b> <b>reagents</b> for fluorescence and chemiluminescence detections have been synthesized {{with the intention}} of improving sensitivity. By properly combining the developed <b>analytical</b> <b>reagents</b> with an HPLC separation technique, one could determine ultra-small amounts of abused drugs such as stimulants, narcotics and obesity drugs in various matrices. Furthermore, chiral analyses of some abused drugs and evaluation of their potential for drug-drug interaction were also performed. The developed methods might be useful for forensic and toxicological studies on drug abuse. Also, the results obtained in our study might contribute to the prediction of and the protection of human health from risks of abused drugs...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{oxidation}} processes involving ·OH {{have been}} in use since late 19th century (such as in Fenton reagent, which, however, was an <b>analytical</b> <b>reagent</b> at that time), the utilization of such oxidative species in water treatment did not receive adequate attention until Glaze et al. [...] suggested the possible generation of ·OH “in sufficient quantity to affect water purification” and defined the term “Advanced Oxidation Processes” {{for the first time}} in 1987. AOPs still have not been put into commercial use on a large scale (especially in developing countries) even up to today mostly because of the relatively high costs. Nevertheless, its high oxidative capability and efficiency make AOPs a popular technique in tertiary treatment in which the most recalcitrant organic and inorganic contaminants are to be eliminated. The increasing interest in water reuse and more stringent regulations regarding water pollution are currently accelerating the implementation of AOPs at full-scale.There are roughly 500 commercialized AOPs installations around the world at present, mostly in Europe and the United States. Other countries like China are showing increasing interests in AOPs.|$|E
