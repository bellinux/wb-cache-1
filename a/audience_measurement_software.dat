40|$|The {{following}} thesis explores how television content production, distribution, consumption, and <b>audience</b> <b>measurement</b> trends {{developed over}} time, {{and focuses on}} how content producers have strategized to capitalize on these trends. The objective of this thesis is to examine opportunities for new <b>audience</b> <b>measurement</b> systems that integrate digital forms of audience interaction and engagement with traditional television ratings systems, in hopes of providing producers and advertisers with {{a new form of}} ratings currency, or rather, a new standardized measurement system. This thesis examines the particular example of television broadcasting in Canada, including three case studies which break down the entire timeline of television broadcasting in Canada into three distinct periods: Analogue, Digital, and Digital Interactive. Each case study summarizes the period's broadcasting policy developments, broadcast distribution and viewing technology innovations, audience viewing trends, and <b>audience</b> <b>measurement</b> tactics. Additionally, each case study highlights interviews from two key informants associated with a significant televised talent show as an example of content production from the time period. This thesis concludes that while the Canadian television and media industry has already recognized the audience's desire to have content available any time, any place, and on any platform, third party <b>audience</b> <b>measurement</b> systems have yet to catch up. Implications of these discoveries are discussed in the conclusion, along with suggestions for further study. Finally, the author suggests a framework for developing <b>audience</b> <b>measurement</b> systems for the Digital Interactive broadcasting period...|$|R
