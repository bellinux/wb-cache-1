Pearl shows that, indeed, in many cases it is the aggregated, not the partitioned data that gives the correct choice of action. Worse yet, given the same table, one should sometimes follow the partitioned and sometimes the <b>aggregated</b> <b>data,</b> depending on {{the story behind the}} data, with each story dictating its own choice. Pearl considers this to be the real paradox behind Simpson's reversal.|$|E

In this work, we construct a disaggregated model of positions and impressions from <b>aggregate</b> <b>data.</b> Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of disaggregation [13]. We extend the previous approach by formulating the disaggregation process as two intertwined problems, rank and impression estimation. We solve these problems (and a natural simplification) using dynamic, mathematical, and constraint programming techniques. We then evaluate the merits of our solution techniques in a simulated ad auction environment, the Ad Auctions division of the annual Trading Agent Competition...|$|R

But what if a patient is not diagnosed, {{and the size of the}} stone is not known; would it be appropriate to consult the <b>aggregated</b> <b>data</b> and administer Treatment B? This would stand contrary to common sense; a treatment that is preferred both under one condition and under its negation should also be preferred when the condition is unknown.|$|E

Estimations performed on <b>aggregate</b> <b>data</b> constrain sector elasticities to homogeneity, which creates a heterogeneity bias. The paper shows such a bias exists in two prominent approaches used to estimate elasticities, which has meaningful consequences for the calibration of the trade elasticity in one-sector, aggregative models. With elasticities calibrated to <b>aggregate</b> <b>data,</b> macroeconomic models can have predictions {{at odds with the}} implications of their multi-sector counterparts.
