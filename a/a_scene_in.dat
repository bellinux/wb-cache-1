5|$|Heyer {{has been}} criticised for anti-semitism, in {{particular}} <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> The Grand Sophy (published in 1950). Her biographers confirm she held prejudiced opinions. This {{was not a}} regular theme of her writing however.|$|E

5|$|The song is the namesake for the 2014 film Obvious Child; {{it appears}} in <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> which two {{characters}} drunkenly dance together. Director Gillian Robespierre titled the film with hope that its meaning would be ambiguous.|$|E

5|$|A behind-the-scenes {{footage from}} the video shoot showed Derulo wearing {{different}} outfits, including a dark pinstripe {{suit with a}} pair of sunglasses, a rose-colored button-down shirt and white pants. The footage also showed Derulo and Sumpter shooting <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> a silver corvette, as well as a kissing scene between the two. A 37-second preview of the video was released on August 12, 2011. The completed video premiered online on August 15.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the possibilities to}} reconstruct an illuminated Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ground plane instead of a slant-range plane using Fast Backprojection (FBP) algorithm. Hence, two methods to reconstruct <b>a</b> SAR <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ground plane are introduced in this paper. The methods are then considered to be extended for bistatic cases where the formation of <b>a</b> SAR <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ground plane is highly recommended. The proposals are examined with simulated SAR data and the simulation results indicate that rebuilding <b>a</b> SAR <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ground plane using FBP is possible...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} scenes that {{appeared}} in the storyboard and animatic were reordered or dropped altogether in {{the final version of the}} episode. Much of the Maggie subplot, for example, was modified before the episode aired. <b>A</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> which the babies lock Ms. Sinclair in her office is missing from the final version of the episode.|$|E
5|$|After the {{introduction}} which shows parts of Cord's missions, the game starts with <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> which Cord is interrogated by now premier Dmitri Nagarov, {{while he is}} being tortured by his assistant Lukyan. After the torture, Cord is fighting for his sanity, and all he knows for sure {{is that he was}} betrayed. He tries to piece together the fragments of his memory, and the player must reconstruct the events that led to his capture.|$|E
5|$|Assante and Banderas {{did their}} own singing, and studied {{to master the}} {{instruments}} their characters use in the film. Assante practiced on drums, preparing for <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> which his character plays a musical number with Tito Puente. Banderas worked to mimic the correct posture and finger placements for his character's trumpet performances, while the actual playing was performed by Arturo Sandoval.|$|E

5|$|For {{the scene}} {{involving}} {{the opening of}} the musical electronic laboratory door lock in Venice, producer Albert R. Broccoli requested special permission from director Steven Spielberg to use the five-note melody from his film Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). In 1985, Broccoli would return the favour by fulfilling Spielberg's request to use the James Bond theme music for <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> his film, The Goonies (1985).|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Fox {{cast her}} in two {{independent}} gangster films filmed in the United Kingdom: The Challenge and Too Hot to Handle. Both films were low-budget, and their American releases were delayed. Too Hot to Handle was not {{released in the}} United States until 1961 (as Playgirl After Dark), and The Challenge in 1963 (as It Takes a Thief). In the United States, censors objected to <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> Too Hot to Handle where Mansfield, wearing silver netting with sequins painted over her nipples, appeared nearly nude.|$|E

5|$|In July 2008, Christian Bale was filming <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> New Mexico for {{the film}} Terminator Salvation with actress Bryce Dallas Howard. The film's {{director}} of photography, Shane Hurlbut, walked into Bale's line of sight, and the actor proceeded to yell obscenities at Hurlbut. Bale said he would quit the film if Hurlbut repeated the error and was not subsequently fired. Hurlbut responded calmly and apologized several times to Bale, and continued shooting for seven hours after the incident.|$|E
5|$|Krusty is a {{favorite}} character {{of several of the}} original writers, many of whom related themselves to him and wanted to write the Krusty-focused episodes. Krusty was used as a chance for show business jokes and thus many of Krusty's experiences and anecdotes are based on real experiences and stories heard by the writers. He was a particular favorite of Brad Bird, who directed the first two Krusty episodes and always tried to animate <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> every Krusty episode.|$|E
5|$|Peter Lorre as Signor Ugarte. Born in Austria-Hungary, Lorre fled Nazi Germany in 1933 after {{starring}} in Fritz Lang's first sound movie, M (1931).

5|$|Phineas and Ferb's {{elaborate}} backyard cirque is {{a parody}} of Cirque du Soleil, a real-life Canadian traveling company which performs circus arts and street entertainment. The scene where Candace jumps onto the stage and sings about her hardships, mainly concerning her inability to successfully tattle on her brothers, references <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> the film Adventures in Babysitting (1987) in which Elisabeth Shue's character sings about her hardships in a similar manner.|$|E
5|$|Production {{designer}} Kenneth Mak included Western {{elements in}} his design, since Foshan, in earlier years, {{was a unique}} place where Chinese and Western cultures converged. Pillars were made to resemble English lampposts, and Western lighting, chairs and tableware were also used. To convey the culture and feel of the time, the buildings were made to look obsolete and worn out. Apart from historical references, Mak also created a glass house which was used in <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> the film.|$|E
5|$|Technique-wise, Sjumandjaja {{used the}} camera to emphasise the narrative. Bajangan, his first work, used long shots to show the main character's lonesomeness. He would often use several shots to show the {{psychological}} issues faced by his characters, focusing on both the characters and the space around them. He also used references to well-known cultural works; <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> Kartini was framed so to reflect Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper.|$|E
