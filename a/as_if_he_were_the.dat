25|$|He {{was granted}} a golden rod (金黄夏楚) by the {{previous}} emperor, with which he was authorised to chastise the current emperor. He was also granted an imperial sword (尚方寶劍) from the previous emperor; whenever it was exhibited the persons surrounding, irrespective of their social classes, must pay respect and compliance to the person exhibiting <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> emperor. All guillotines of Bao Zheng were authorised to execute any persons without first obtaining approval from the emperor, whilst some accounts stating the imperial sword was a license to execute any royals before so reporting.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{few hours}} of Philip {{ascending}} to the throne, Lerma had been made a royal counsellor by the new king and set about establishing himself as a fully fledged valido, or royal favourite. Lerma, in due course declared a duke, positioned himself as the gateway to the king. All the business of government, Philip instructed, was to arrive in writing and be channeled through Lerma before reaching him. Whilst Philip was not hugely active in government in other ways, once these memoranda, or consulta, had reached him he appears to have been assiduous in commenting on them. Debates in royal councils would now only begin upon the written instruction of the king – again, through Lerma. All members of royal councils were under orders to maintain complete transparency with Lerma as the king's personal representative; indeed, in 1612 the councils were ordered by Philip to obey Lerma <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> king. The degree to which Lerma himself played an active role in government has been disputed. Contemporaries were inclined to see Lerma's hand in every action of government; others have since thought Lerma to have 'neither the temperament nor the energy' to impose himself greatly on the actions of government; still others consider Lerma to have carefully attended only those Councils of State that addressed matters of great importance to the king, creating a space for the wider professionalisation of government that had been lacking under Philip II.|$|E
500|$|Henry's {{next steps}} {{are not well}} documented; one chronicler, Orderic Vitalis, {{suggests}} that he travelled in the French Vexin, along the Normandy border, {{for over a year}} with a small band of followers. By the end of the year, Robert and William Rufus had fallen out once again, and the Treaty of Rouen had been abandoned. In 1092, Henry and his followers seized the Normandy town of Domfront. Domfront had previously been controlled by Robert of Bellême, but the inhabitants disliked his rule and invited Henry to take over the town, which he did in a bloodless coup. Over the next two years, Henry re-established his network of supporters across western Normandy, forming what Judith Green terms a [...] "court in waiting". By 1094, he was allocating lands and castles to his followers <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Normandy. William Rufus began to support Henry with money, encouraging his campaign against Robert, and Henry used some of this to construct a substantial castle at Domfront.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} the back of the seat, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> {{addressing}} himself to that; and softly played upon it with his hands, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> striking chords upon a dumb piano.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Grewgious {{said all}} this, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> reading it aloud; or, still more, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> repeating a lesson. So expressionless of any {{approach}} to spontaneity were {{his face and}} manner.|$|R

500|$|The [...] "Dual Spires enhanced" [...] video at the Psych website lists further {{references}} to Twin Peaks. Shawn's name for Gus in this episode is [...] "Lodge Blackmunn", a direct {{reference to the}} Black and White Lodge. Leo the Cinnamon Owl is a reference to Killer BOB, who possessed Leland Palmer and often {{took the form of}} an owl. The sheriff's deputy is Deputy Frost, named after Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost. The doctors of both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks have coconuts in their offices. Both Paula's and Laura's diaries described meetings with [...] "J". Sheriff Jackson tells Bob he needs to be strong for his wife. Dr Hayward says the same thing to Leland Palmer in Twin Peaks. Upon entering the town Gus mentions that the residents are looking at him <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> first black man they had ever seen. There are very few black men in Twin Peaks. When they enter the Sawmill Diner Bob Barker says [...] "Top of the morning to you." [...] In the first season of Twin Peaks, Pete Martell corrected Josie Packard on the saying. Maudette wears an orchid in her hair; Harold grew orchids in Twin Peaks. In the library Shawn asks if they can [...] "poke around" [...] but he and Gus immediately say [...] "peek" [...] in correction. Thus [...] "peek", as in Twin Peaks, is spoken twice. A man wearing a hat in the Sawmill Diner gives Shawn and Gus a thumbs up. The older room service attendant did the same thing to Agent Cooper in Twin Peaks. A record player is featured prominently in both the Barker and Palmer homes. The Roadhouse was also a location in Twin Peaks. Both Maudette and Audrey Horne love to dance. Paula's friend Jack is completely blind in one eye, referencing Twin Peaks' brothel named [...] "One Eyed Jacks". In the library Shawn and Gus find a book entitled [...] "Putt Your Way to a Better Future." [...] After Leland Palmer killed Maddy Ferguson he was seen putting golf balls around in his living room. When Randy is using the table saw it resembles the sawmill scene from the extended opening credits of Twin Peaks. When Maudette is placed in the body bag it is bent {{in such a way that}} it resembles a smile, like the smiling bag clue Agent Cooper found. On Maudette's desk beside her computer is a roll of green tape like the kind used by Leland Palmer to tie up Jacques Renault. In the cabin Bob Barker lights a match and holds it up like Leland Palmer did when describing BOB to Agent Cooper. Bob Barker wears a gold ring on his pinky, something Agent Cooper did in Twin Peaks. In the cabin the walls are red with red drapes as an allusion to the [...] "Red Room" [...] in Agent Cooper's dream.|$|E
2500|$|Fans asked Nimoy {{questions}} about current {{events such as}} the Vietnam War and LSD <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> Vulcan scientist; one even asked the actor to lay his hands on a friend's eyes to heal them. When a biracial girl wrote asking for advice {{on how to deal with}} persecution as [...] "a half-breed", Nimoy responded that young Vulcans had treated Spock similarly and that she should, as he did, [...] "realize the difference between popularity and true greatness". The actor believed that the character appealed to viewers, especially teenagers, because ...|$|E
2500|$|Alliance {{leaders also}} were alarmed at Lee's behaviour, which they {{considered}} unseemly for the Chief Minister of a state. They {{thought he was}} acting <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> Prime Minister of a sovereign nation. Finance Minister Tan Siew Sin of the MCA labelled Lee as the [...] "greatest, disruptive force in {{the entire history of}} Malaysia and Malaya." [...] Lee now seemed determined to press forward politically and continue contesting elections nationwide, with the formation of the Malaysian Solidarity Council —- a coalition of political parties which called for a [...] "Malaysian Malaysia", duplicating the effort introduced earlier by Dato' Onn Ja'afar.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her; first <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> trying to remember, then <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> might have <b>been</b> trying to forget. [...] "Nothing, I think--at that place." ...|$|R

60|$|I think, now, how odd it was, but how wonderfully like Mr. Micawber, that, when he {{went from}} London to Canterbury, he should have talked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> going to the {{farthest}} limits of the earth; and, {{when he went}} from England to Australia, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> going for a little trip across the channel.|$|R
2500|$|The name Albion for Great Britain {{fell from}} favour, {{and the island}} was {{described}} in Greek as Πρεττανία or Βρεττανία, in Latin Britannia, an inhabitant as Βρεττανός, Britannus, with the adjective Βρεττανικός, Britannicus, equating to [...] "British". With the Roman conquest of Britain the name Britannia {{was used for the}} province of Roman Britain. The Emperor Claudius was honoured with the agnomen Britannicus <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> conqueror, and coins were struck from AD 46 inscribed DE BRITAN, DE BRITANN, DE BRITANNI, or DE BRITANNIS. With the visit of Hadrian in AD 121 coins introduced a female figure with the label BRITANNIA as a personification or goddess of the place. These and later Roman coins introduced the seated figure of Britannia which would be reintroduced in the 17th century.|$|E
2500|$|Weeks later, Marie {{has died}} and George has been invited by the French {{government}} to do a presentation of the Chromolume on the island the painting depicts. There George reveals to his friend Dennis that he has turned down his next commission. Feeling adrift and unsure, George reads from a book he inherited from his grandmother – the same one Dot used {{to learn to read}} – and ponders the similarities between himself and his great-grandfather ("Lesson #8"). A vision of Dot appears and greets George, whom she addresses <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> George she knew. He confides his doubts to her and she tells him to stop worrying about whether his choices are right and simply make them ("Move On"). George finds some words written {{in the back of the}} book – the words George often muttered while he worked. As George reads them aloud the characters from the painting fill the stage and recreate their tableau ("Sunday"). As they leave and the stage resembles a blank canvas, George reads: [...] "White: a blank page or canvas. His favorite – so many possibilities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dönitz {{government}} ordered dissolved by Eisenhower: Karl Dönitz {{continued to}} act <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> German head of state, but his Flensburg government (so-called {{because it was}} based at Flensburg in northern Germany and controlled only a small area around the town), was not recognized by the Allies. On 12 May an Allied liaison team arrived in Flensburg and took quarters aboard the passenger ship Patria. The liaison officers and the Supreme Allied Headquarters soon realized {{that they had no}} need to act through the Flensburg government and that its members should be arrested. On 23 May, acting on SHAEF's orders and with the approval of the Soviets, American Major General Rooks summoned Dönitz aboard the Patria and communicated to him that he and all the members of his Government were under arrest, and that their government was dissolved. The Allies had a problem, because they realized that although the German armed forces had surrendered unconditionally, SHAEF had failed to use the document created by the [...] "European Advisory Commission" [...] (EAC) and so there had been no formal surrender by the civilian German government. This was considered a very important issue, because just as the civilian, but not military, surrender in 1918 had been used by Hitler to create the [...] "stab in the back" [...] argument, the Allies did not want to give any future hostile German regime a legal argument to resurrect an old quarrel.|$|E
