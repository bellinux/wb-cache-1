5|$|Even {{in terms}} of fan base, the two fan bases are close in a way.

However, Adrian North, a Heriot-Watt University professor who studies genre listeners found that metal listeners were above <b>all</b> <b>else</b> creative, at ease with themselves and introverted — qualities he also found in classical listeners.|$|E

Additionally, a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch, longer duration, and enhanced wave setup.|$|E
5|$|Being a scientist, above <b>all</b> <b>else,</b> Huxley {{presented}} agnosticism {{as a form}} of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting objective, testable {{evidence is}} not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. Karl Popper would also describe himself as an agnostic. According to philosopher William L. Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Whig Party in the early 1850s, many former Whigs joined the Know Nothing, or American, Party, and Charles S. Morehead was elected governor from that party in 1855. Sectarian tensions gripped the state in the lead-up to the Civil War, and while the majority of Kentuckians favored the preservation of the Union above <b>all</b> <b>else,</b> a self-constituted group of Confederate sympathizers met at Russellville and formed a Confederate government for the state. While this provisional government never displaced the elected government in Frankfort, two men served as Confederate governors of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the centripetal force necessary to cause the bike to deviate from a straight path, along with cornering force due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, <b>all</b> <b>else</b> being equal.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Scott and {{his party}} overshadowed <b>all</b> <b>else</b> in the British public's mind, {{including}} Amundsen's feat in being first at the Pole. For many years the image of Scott as a tragic hero, beyond reproach, remained virtually unchallenged, for although there were rifts among some who were close to the expedition, including relatives of those who died, this disharmony was not public. There was no real change in public perceptions until the 1970s, by which time nearly all those directly concerned with the expedition were dead.|$|E

5|$|Themistocles {{therefore}} {{suggested a}} second strategy to the allies. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. The pass could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual strategy {{was adopted by the}} congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should <b>all</b> <b>else</b> fail, whilst the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E
5|$|A world {{containing}} {{creatures who}} are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, <b>all</b> <b>else</b> being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not {{do what is right}} freely. To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same time}} prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of moral evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.|$|E
5|$|Henriksen {{was one of}} {{the several}} actors, {{including}} Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton, cast in Aliens who had collaborated with James Cameron on The Terminator. Roz Kaveney, in her analysis of Ash in From Alien to The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, draws parallels to Bishop as a representation of the Three Laws of Robotics. Although Ash's programming allows (and encourages) harming humans, Bishop puts human life above <b>all</b> <b>else</b> in accordance with the First Law of Robotics. Bishop was studied by LeiLani Nishime of the University of Texas Press in 2005 as a theoretical dramatization of how humans would deal with the presence of an Other, concerning Ripley's initial apprehension about being near a synthetic after her life-threatening encounter with Ash. According to an article by Anton Karl Kozlovic of the University of Nebraska Omaha, Bishop's altruistic actions (which include rescuing Newt and Ripley) contradict a trend towards technophobia in pre-1990 films.|$|E

5|$|Peking opera {{features}} {{four main}} types of performers. Performing troupes often have several of each variety, {{as well as}} numerous secondary and tertiary performers. With their elaborate and colorful costumes, performers are the only focal points on Peking opera's characteristically sparse stage. They use the skills of speech, song, dance, and combat in movements that are symbolic and suggestive, rather than realistic. Above <b>all</b> <b>else,</b> the skill of performers is evaluated according to the beauty of their movements. Performers also adhere {{to a variety of}} stylistic conventions that help audiences navigate the plot of the production. The layers of meaning within each movement must be expressed in time with music. The music of Peking opera can be divided into the Xipi (西皮) and Erhuang (二黄) styles. Melodies include arias, fixed-tune melodies, and percussion patterns. The repertoire of Peking opera includes over 1,400 works, which are based on Chinese history, folklore, and, increasingly, contemporary life.|$|E
5|$|Seydlitz was {{generally}} admired for the superb coup d'œil {{that allowed him}} to utilize the cavalry to its full potential. His 19th century biographer, K. A. Varnhagen von Ense, related that Seydlitz lived above all for the service, and promoted the training of his hussars before <b>all</b> <b>else.</b> According to Anton König, who wrote in 17801790, Seydlitz performed best at taverns and excelled in practical jokes: one would gather that Seydlitz was a drunkard, a rake, and a savage, but another of his biographers, Bernhard von Poten, cited conflicting descriptions offered by Seydlitz's contemporaries, particularly Warnery, as more accurate. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to support König's assertion, at least of Seydlitz's excesses: Seydlitz was no doubt dependent upon his tobacco and had been since his teenage years, although he smoked a pipe rather than using snuff, as many officers did; he was indeed reckless, as his career testified; he enjoyed the company of women; and Seydlitz indeed suffered from recurring illness.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed, Hitler's {{attention}} became {{focused on}} foreign affairs and {{the conduct of the}} war, to the exclusion of <b>all</b> <b>else.</b> Hess, not directly engaged in either of these endeavours, became increasingly sidelined from the affairs of the nation and from Hitler's attention; Bormann had successfully supplanted Hess in many of his duties and usurped his position at Hitler's side. Also concerned that Germany would face a war on two fronts as plans progressed for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union scheduled to take place in 1941, Hess boldly decided to attempt to bring Britain to the negotiating table by travelling there himself to seek meetings with the British government. He asked the advice of Albrecht Haushofer, who suggested several potential contacts in Britain. Hess settled on fellow aviator Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, the Duke of Hamilton, whom he had never met. On Hess's instructions, Haushofer wrote to Hamilton in September 1940, but the letter was intercepted by MI5 and Hamilton did not see it until March 1941. Hamilton was chosen in the mistaken belief {{that he was one of}} the leaders of an opposition party opposed to war with Germany, and because he was a friend of Haushofer.|$|E

5|$|Well {{before the}} American victory at Buena Vista, {{political}} clubs were formed which supported Taylor for President. His support {{was drawn from}} an unusually broad assortment of political bands, including Whigs and Democrats, Northerners and Southerners, allies and opponents of national leaders such as Henry Clay and James K. Polk. By late 1846 Taylor's opposition to a presidential run began to weaken, and {{it became clear that}} his principles more closely resembled Whig orthodoxy. Still, he maintained that he would only accept election as a national, independent figure, rather than a partisan loyalist. Taylor declared, as the 1848 Whig Party convention approached, that he had always been a Whig in principle, but he did consider himself a Jeffersonian-Democrat. Many southerners believed that Taylor supported slavery and its expansion into the new territory absorbed from Mexico, and some were angered when Taylor suggested that if he were elected President he would not veto the Wilmot Proviso, which proposed against such an expansion. This position did not enhance his support from activist antislavery elements in the Northern U.S., as these wanted Taylor to speak out strongly in support of the Proviso, not simply fail to veto it. Most abolitionists did not support Taylor, since he was a slave-owner. Many southerners also knew that Taylor supported states' rights and was opposed to protective tariffs and government spending for internal improvements. The Whigs hoped that he put the federal union of the United States above <b>all</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{attempting}} {{to visit the}} San 'Shyuum home world, the four are captured by Builders, commanded by the Master Builder. The Didact and humans are held prisoner, but Bornstellar is returned {{to the care of}} his father because of his family's status and power. On his family's home world, he uses the time and peace to reflect on recent events, and allow the imprint of the Didact to fully assimilate into his thoughts. He overhears an argument between his father and another Builder, from which he learns that his father was one of the chief builders of the Halos. The Didact opposed the Builders' decision to construct such a weapon, hence his exile. It is soon revealed that the Master Builder is being brought up on charges and that the Halo weapons had been recalled, but one of the rings had gone missing. Bornstellar is called to a Forerunner core planet to testify against the Master Builder, who has been put on trial for crimes against The Mantle, a Forerunner philosophy that values the preservation of life over <b>all</b> <b>else.</b> Just as the trial is about to begin, an AI, Mendicant Bias, betrays the Forerunners and intends to use the combined power of the Halos to begin wiping out the Forerunner race.|$|E
