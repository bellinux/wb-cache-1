As such, the Democrats pushed as well the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, a legal expansion that became law.|$|E
25|$|Some {{policies}} cause reverse racism, {{in which}} Han Chinese or even ethnic minorities from other regions {{are treated as}} second-class citizens in the ethnic region. Similarly, there are wide-ranging preferential policies (<b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>programs)</b> in place to promote social and economic development for ethnic minorities, including preferential employment, political appointments, and business loans. Universities typically have quotas reserved for ethnic minorities, {{even if they have}} lower admission test scores.

25|$|The 4–1–4 split makes PICS {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} 1978 Bakke case, which held that affirmative action was unconstitutional in the case directly before the Court; but, nonetheless, Bakke was used to uphold the validity of <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>programs</b> that fostered diversity in higher education {{for a quarter of}} a century.

25|$|For example, in Bolling v. Sharpe, , {{which was}} a {{companion}} case to Brown v. Board of Education, the schools of the District of Columbia were desegregated even though Washington is federal. Likewise, in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña , an <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>program</b> {{by the federal government}} was subjected to strict scrutiny based on equal protection.|$|R
25|$|In these {{affirmative action}} cases, the Supreme Court has employed, or {{has said it}} employed, strict scrutiny, since the affirmative action {{policies}} challenged by the plaintiffs categorized by race. The policy in Grutter, and a Harvard College admissions policy praised by Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke, passed muster because the Court deemed that they were narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest in diversity. On one side, critics have argued—including Justice Clarence Thomas in his dissent to Grutter—that the scrutiny the Court has applied in some cases is much less searching than true strict scrutiny, and that the Court has acted not as a principled legal institution but as a biased political one. On the other side, {{it is argued that}} the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to prevent the socio-political subordination of some groups by others, not to prevent classification; since this is so, non-invidious classifications, such as those used by <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>programs,</b> should not be subjected to heightened scrutiny.|$|E
25|$|About 800,000 out of {{an earlier}} total {{population}} of 5.2 million whites have left South Africa since 1995, {{according to a report}} from 2009. (Apartheid, a system of segregation of whites, blacks, and people of other races, had ended in 1994.) The country has suffered a high rate of violent crime, a primary stated reason for emigration. Other causes include attacks against white farmers, concern about being excluded by <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>programs,</b> rolling blackouts in electrical supplies, and worries about corruption and autocratic political tendencies among new leaders. Since many of those who leave are highly educated, there are shortages of skilled personnel in the government, teaching, and other professional areas. Some observers fear the long-term consequences, as South Africa's labor policies make it difficult to attract skilled immigrants. The migration of whites in South Africa was facilitated by the creation of immigration routes into European countries for people with European ancestry. For instance, the British government introduced the notion of patriality to ensure white people of British ancestry from Africa could settle in the UK. In the global economy, some professionals and skilled people have been attracted to work in the US and European nations.|$|E

500|$|Although the Supreme Court had outlawed {{segregation}} in schools, {{and had even}} ordered school districts {{to take steps to}} assure integration, the question of the legality of voluntary <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>programs</b> initiated by universities was unresolved. [...] Proponents deemed such programs necessary to make up for past discrimination, while opponents believed they were illegal and a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. [...] An earlier case that the Supreme Court had taken in an attempt to address the issue, DeFunis v. Odegaard (1974), was dismissed on procedural grounds.|$|E
500|$|Dworkin {{warned in}} 1978 that [...] "Powell's opinion suffers from {{fundamental}} weaknesses, {{and if the}} Court is {{to arrive at a}} coherent position, far more judicial work remains to be done than a relieved public yet realizes". The Supreme Court has continued to grapple with the question of affirmative action in higher education. [...] In the 2003 case of Grutter v. Bollinger, it reaffirmed Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke in a majority opinion, thus rendering moot concerns expressed by lower courts that Bakke might not be binding precedent due to the fractured lineup of justices in a plurality opinion. The court's decision in the 2013 case of Fisher v. University of Texas made alterations to the standards by which courts must judge <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>programs,</b> but continued to permit race to be taken into consideration in university admissions, while forbidding outright quotas.|$|E
500|$|The case {{fractured}} the court; {{the nine}} justices issued {{a total of}} six opinions. The judgment of the court was written by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.; two different blocs of four justices joined various parts of Powell's opinion. [...] Finding diversity in the classroom to be a compelling state interest, Powell opined that affirmative action in general was allowed under the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. [...] Nevertheless, UC Davis's program went too far for a majority of justices, and it was struck down and Bakke admitted. [...] The practical effect of Bakke was that most <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>programs</b> continued without change. Questions about whether the Bakke case was merely a plurality opinion or binding precedent were answered in 2003 when the court upheld Powell's position in a majority opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger.|$|E

500|$|Allan Bakke {{had given}} few {{interviews}} during the pendency of the case, {{and on the}} day it was decided, went to work as usual in Palo Alto. He issued a statement through attorney Colvin expressing his pleasure in the result and that he planned to begin his medical studies that fall. Most of the lawyers and university personnel who would {{have to deal with the}} aftermath of Bakke doubted the decision would change very much. [...] The large majority of <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>programs</b> at universities, unlike that of the UC Davis medical school, did not use rigid numerical quotas for minority admissions and could continue. According to Bernard Schwartz in his account of Bakke, the Supreme Court's decision [...] "permits admission officers to operate programs which grant racial preferences—provided that they do not do so as blatantly as was done under the sixteen-seat 'quota' provided at Davis".|$|E
500|$|Although public {{universities}} were integrated by court decree, selective colleges and graduate programs, and the professions which stemmed from them, remained almost all white. [...] Many African-Americans had attended inferior schools and were ill-prepared {{to compete in}} the admissions process. [...] This was unsatisfactory to many activists of the late 1960s, who protested that given the African-American's history of discrimination and poverty, some preference should be given to minorities. [...] This became a commonly held liberal position, and large numbers of public and private universities began <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> <b>programs.</b> Among these were the University of California, Davis School of Medicine (UC Davis or [...] "the university"), which was founded in 1968 and had an all-white inaugural class. [...] The faculty was concerned by this, and the school began a special admissions program [...] "to compensate victims of unjust societal discrimination". The application form contained a question asking if the student wished to be considered disadvantaged, and, if so, these candidates were screened by a special committee, on which more than half the members were from minority groups. Initially, the entering class was 50 students, and eight seats were put aside for minorities; when the class size doubled in 1971, there were 16 seats which were to be filled by candidates recommended by the special committee. While nominally open to whites, no one of that race was admitted under the program, which was unusual in that a specific number of seats were to be filled by candidates through this program.|$|E
