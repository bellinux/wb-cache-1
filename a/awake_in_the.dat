5|$|The Dream Lord keeps Amy <b>awake</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TARDIS reality {{while the}} Doctor and Rory fall asleep {{and return to}} the Leadworth reality. The Dream Lord {{questions}} Amy as to whom she would choose between Rory and the Doctor. He states that she must choose between the worlds; one leads to a peaceful married life with Rory while the other leads to adventure and excitement with the Doctor. Amy returns to Leadworth and rejoins Rory in defending her house from the Eknodine whilst the Doctor is trying to rescue people from Leadworth in a motor-caravan. As Amy believes she is going into labour, Rory is sprayed by the Eknodine and turns to dust. Amy decides that she is willing to risk her own life for the chance of seeing Rory again and concludes the Leadworth reality is false. Amy and the Doctor drive the motor-caravan into the house, leading to their assumed deaths. The three wake up again on the TARDIS where they are congratulated by the Dream Lord, who then reactivates the TARDIS. After the Dream Lord's departure Amy and Rory are surprised by the Doctor when he directs the TARDIS to self-destruct, apparently killing them all.|$|E

25|$|If for {{whatever}} reason one didn't light at sunset or nightfall, the lights should be kindled later, {{as long as there}} are people in the streets.

25|$|Śrīrāghavapriyādarśanam (Sanskrit: श्रीराघवप्रियादर्शनम्). Viśvāmitra, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa {{arrive in}} Mithilā. Rāma {{is pleased to}} be in the city of Mithilā, but the other kings who have come in Sītā's Svayaṃvara are not pleased about his arrival. The people of Mithilā {{experience}} bliss in seeing Rāma. When Janaka asks Viśvāmitra about the two princes, Viśvāmitra introduces Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to Janaka. Janaka takes both princes to his palace and welcomes them. Later Lakṣmaṇa wishes to see the city of Mithilā and Rāma accompanies him. The children of Mithilā take Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa around the city, and embrace Rāma in the end. Early morning on the next day, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa go to the royal garden of Janaka to get flowers for Viśvāmitra's worship. Sītā arrives in the same garden to worship Pārvatī on the day before her Svayaṃvara. Sītā and Rāma see each other for the first time when they come face-to-face in the garden. Rāma tells Lakṣmaṇa about the attraction he feels for Sītā. He tells Lakṣmaṇa that Sītā must be his wife in future, for even in his dreams his mind never longs for the wife of another. Lakṣmaṇa then bows to Sītā, thinking of her as his mother. Sītā worships Rāma in her mind and then departs for her palace after worshipping Pārvatī. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa return to Viśvāmitra and worship him with the flowers from Janaka's royal garden. Rāma tells Viśvāmitra everything about the attraction he felt for Sītā. Viśvāmitra blesses Rāma and goes to sleep. Rāma is <b>awake</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night, admiring the beauty of the moon which reminds him of the face of Sītā.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} season premiere, [...] "In My Time of Dying," [...] Sam and John <b>awake</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{hospital}} with only minor injuries, but a dying Dean is comatose. John secretly summons Azazel, and seems {{to know what the}} demon's plans are. He then makes a deal to save Dean, giving up his life, soul, and the Colt. Before dying, John instructs Dean to kill Sam should he become evil. The fourth season episode [...] "On the Head of a Pin" [...] reveals that the demon Alastair tortured John in Hell for over a century, with John refusing the demon's offer to stop if he himself would torture someone else. His soul escapes from Hell in {{the second season}} finale [...] "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part 2" [...] when a gateway to Hell is opened. He saves Dean from Azazel, and distracts the demon by temporarily forcing him out of his host, long enough for Dean to kill Azazel with the Colt when he returns to his usual body. John then gives Sam and Dean a loving smile before becoming engulfed in a white light. However, the fifth season episode [...] "Dark Side of the Moon" [...] suggests that he might not be in Heaven.|$|E

2500|$|In TNGs [...] "Q Who?", Guinan {{mentions}} that the Borg are [...] "made up of organic and artificial life [...] {{which has been}} developing for [...] thousands of centuries." [...] In the later episode of Star Trek: Voyager, [...] "", Gedrin, of the race the Vaadwaur, says that before his people and he were put into suspended animation 892 years earlier, the Borg had assimilated only a few colonies in the Delta Quadrant and were considered essentially a minor nuisance. Now <b>awake</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 24th century, he is amazed {{to see that the}} Borg control a vast area of the Delta Quadrant. Seven of Nine comments that the Borg's collective memories of that time period are fragmentary, though it is never established why that is.|$|E
2500|$|... "Great {{attention}} {{is to be}} paid to regularity and choice of diet. Intemperance of every kind is hurtful, but nothing is more productive of this disease than drinking bad wine. Of eatables those which are most prejudicial are all fat and greasy meats and pastry... Moderate exercise contributes in a superior degree to promote the digestion of food and prevent flatulence; those, however, who are necessarily confined to a sedentary occupation, should particularly avoid applying themselves to study or bodily labor immediately after eating... Going to bed before the usual hour is a frequent cause of night-mare, as it either occasions the patient to sleep too long or to lie long <b>awake</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night. Passing a whole night or part of a night without rest likewise gives birth to the disease, as it occasions the patient, on the succeeding night, to sleep too soundly. Indulging in sleep too late in the morning, is an almost certain method to bring on the paroxysm, and the more frequently it returns, the greater strength it acquires; the propensity to sleep at this time is almost irresistible." ...|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> standby mode, the AGC slept {{most of the}} time; {{therefore}} it was not awake to perform the Pinc instruction needed to update the AGC's real time clock at 10ms intervals.

2500|$|His car, [...] "007", was totaled. Allison {{would later}} {{claim to have}} {{sustained}} an out-of-body experience after the crash.

40|$|The {{current study}} aimed {{to examine the}} naturalistic {{relationship}} between physical activity and sleep by exploring frequency, type, and timing of exercise and their association {{with a variety of}} sleep variables (e. g., sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency). Young adults (n = 1003) completed a variety of self-report questionnaires, including a week-long sleep diary and a survey of typical frequency, type, and timing of exercise completed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past week. Increased frequency of physical activity was related to increased sleep efficiency (total sleep time/time in bed), decreased time in bed, and decreased time spent <b>awake</b> <b>in</b> bed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. Greater amounts of exercise energy expenditure (i. e., metabolic equivalents) per week was related to increased sleep efficiency, and decreased time in bed and time spent <b>awake</b> <b>in</b> bed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. After controlling for other factors, this relationship remained true only for time spent <b>awake</b> <b>in</b> bed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. Early morning exercisers reported shorter total sleep time and time in bed than those who typically exercised at other times. No exercise differences were found between those who met the research diagnostic criteria for insomnia and those who did not. This study provides valuable information to help guide future experimental and intervention studies...|$|R
50|$|During his 1748 {{voyage to}} England after his rescue, Newton had a spiritual conversion. The ship {{encountered}} a severe storm {{off the coast}} of Donegal, Ireland and almost sank.

50|$|However, the burnt {{corpse of}} Nemesis {{is still alive}} and he is {{eventually}} recovered by Apocalypse.

This procedure signifies the birth of Holocaust and the character eventually reassumes his position as a Horseman of Apocalypse, where the character becomes a mainstay.|$|R
