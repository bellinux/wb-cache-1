[...] TVTV had received initial funding for the documentary through a small grant from the Stern Foundation, and an additional promise from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

50|$|The long-run {{marginal}} cost curve {{is shaped by}} returns to scale, a long-run concept, rather than the law of diminishing marginal returns, which is a short-run concept. The long-run {{marginal cost}} curve tends to be flatter than its short-run counterpart due to increased input flexibility as to cost minimization. The long-run marginal cost curve intersects the long-run average cost curve at the minimum point of the latter. When long-run marginal costs are below long-run <b>average</b> <b>costs,</b> long-run <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> are falling (as to additional units of output).

5000|$|A typical {{average cost}} curve {{will have a}} U-shape, because fixed costs are all {{incurred}} before any production takes place and marginal costs are typically increasing, because of diminishing marginal productivity.

An increasing marginal cost curve will intersect a U-shaped average cost curve at its minimum, after which point the average cost curve begins to slope upward. For further increases in production beyond this minimum, marginal cost is above <b>average</b> <b>costs,</b> so <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> are increasing as quantity increases. An example of this typical case would be a factory designed to produce a specific quantity of widgets per period: below a certain production level, average cost is higher due to under-utilized equipment, while above that level, production bottlenecks increase the average cost.|$|E
